1367972587.0,217,self.Thetruthishere,1dwdf8,My Skinwalker Encounter [ME] [FAM],redheadedalex,255,38,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1dwdf8/my_skinwalker_encounter_me_fam/,"So I posted here awhile back with some skinwalker stories and figured I would share more.  I am having a hard time remembering the stories told to me by my Navajo family, but when I skype with them again I will ask for me.  This creepy set of events happened directly to me though, so here goes--my first personal encounter(s).  I know, it's lengthy.  But hey...skinwalkers.  They require backstory.  

It started when my two brothers, ""David"" and ""Luke"", and Luke's girlfriend ""Sarah"" all drove down to the desert to spend some time in the country.  This is res land as it were, so red dirt everywhere (Southern Utah....a majestically beautiful place, if you ever get a chance.)  We had some pistols and decided to go out and target practice.  We took our gear and some old targets to this place called ""Devil's Heartbeat.""  I had never been, but all three of them were familiar with the area.  It was a canyon about 200 feet deep.  We stayed on one end of the canyon, by the dropoffs, and to our left was the ravine, and about fifty feet over, the opposite side of the canyon rose up above us.  On the opposite end there were some Anasazi ruins. 

The Navajo may disagree with historians on the Anasazi's origins and departure (according to Navajo legend, they simply 'disappeared' from existence, leaving behind plates, dishes, and food, and went into another dimension or some equivalent) but whatever the history, the Navajo do NOT like to wander in Anasazi ruins.  I never asked why, but figured it had something to do with disrespect, preserving history, etc.  As such, none of the others cared a bit about these canyon ruins.  They were more interested in shooting pistols.

I could see old beds, ladders, and even cave drawings on the cliffs with my naked eye.  And I got this strange fixation on going over there.  I am not Navajo and felt that their rules didn't apply to me.  I set off down the cliffs without rope and decided I would climb down, cross the canyon floor, and then climb back up.  This was a bad idea for a million reasons, but it was like some obsession.  I can't explain the feeling.  It was like magnetism.  I wanted to be in those ruins and it wasn't just some touristy curiosity.  It felt like I was meant to go there.  I kept slipping and getting stuck on the rocks, and I was so frustrated I almost started crying.  Finally I was deterred by the unmistakable sound of a growl coming from the canyon floor below me.  There were trees down there so I couldn't see what was making the growl, but ""mountain lion"" immediately rose to mind and I got my ass back up the cliffside.  

I said nothing to the others, and we shot the guns for awhile.  The only other strange occurrence was while Sarah was aiming--things got eerily quiet.  We all heard a sound from behind us, maybe twenty feet away.  It was like a growl, then a hoarse laugh.  Almost like a lion, and then a hyena.  We had a clear view of the entire area and there was nothing there, certainly not on the clifftops where we heard it anyway.  The creepy part was that while David, Sarah and I all heard it from a close distance, Luke heard the exact same noise right by his ear.  

We ended up camping out there to see if anything would happen, and this is when I got completely terrified.  Before, I was only scared of wild animals.  We had guns though, and were sleeping with no bags or tents, just some blankets under the stars and a little fire, so I felt safe when we all laid down.  I fell asleep pretty quickly, but woke up a few hours later to see everyone else laying with their eyes open wide, listening.  The canyon was completely full of noises.  The only way to describe it is people banging rocks together.  There would be one ""set"" maybe 300 yards away, then another clacking 200 yards away, and then 50 yards away.  The canyon echos, so it was hard to tell exactly how many ""rock smacking rock"" noises there were, but they sounded like morse code.  We listened to this for maybe ten minutes.  No other animal noises, no nothing.  Finally David (who is kind of a hardass and the least superstitious of his family) shouted, ""SHUT UUUUUUUUP!"" 

And everything immediately stopped.  My heart was in my throat.  We just sat there and stared at each other, wide eyed.  It was dead quiet, and then we heard another super weird noise from the Anasazi ruins.  I don't know how to explain this one either, but it sounded kind of like a zebra noise.  Like these squeaky trills.  It got louder, and then the rocks/sticks/whatever started up again.  But this was worse, because now OTHER animal noises came.  We heard what sounded like wolves or coyotes barking, monkeys screeching (in my opinion, those were the most terrifying) owls hooting, and through it all that terrible zebra noises.  [Here are some real zebra noises if you want to hear.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQcx8C8Aj_g)  We said nope, and got our happy little asses out of there immediately.  It took us maybe ten minutes to douse the fire, pack our blankets, and speed away, and the noises were continuing that entire time.  

That night I was ...obviously... pretty shaken up.  Before I could fall asleep again, my Navajo mother came and sat by me, and said that she could tell I had a rough day. (we hadn't mentioned the creepy shit, to avoid a lecture about fucking with the spirits.)  She asked me about it, and I ended up spilling my guts about not seeing the canyon ruins.  It was something personal, it felt like.  I wanted to go there, why couldn't I go there? It would have been beautiful.  After I word-vomited all over her, I could see that she had a really concerned look on her face.  ""What is it?"" I asked, totally confused, and she explained something I had no idea about: ""The spirits in the ruins like to lure people up.  When they get up on the ground, the spirits push them off.  That's why we don't go there."" 

I remained creeped out for the remainder of the visit.  The town has a public-accessible kiva, kind of a tourist trap for a little podunk place, but since I didn't see the ruins up close I went down into the kiva.  And I went alone, as of course my superstitious family refused to ""enter other natives' dwellings.""  I figured that nothing could push me off a cliff if I was in a kiva.

I was right, but something even worse happened.  Fast forward to a few weeks later.  I worked at a shitty call center in Salt Lake City, third shift.  It was my first night alone and I was feeling jumpy ever since the kiva.  My brothers already warned me that I had a skinwalker following me, but I of course didn't believe it.  

I don't smoke, but I follow my coworkers out for smoke breaks because I like the chat.  Tonight, I lurked in the doorway because I had this horrible cloud of dread hanging over me.  I was peeping out the glass door and being a total weirdo.  It hit me then how paranoid I had been.  That's what skinwalkers do....they mess with your mind.  While I was pacing in front of the glass doors I decided that this whole thing was fucking stupid and I was going to go outside, and stand there, for the rest of my 10 minute break.  

Most of the smokers were already filing back in, but I walked out and put my hands in my pockets.  Looked at the sky, looked in the building, mentally patting myself on the back for not being a pussy.  Then I saw something that I will never ever be able to give a rational or even halfway accountable explanation for.  We have like, six parking lots....in one of the lots far away from me, maybe 100 feet, I could see something walking.  It was a dog, obviously, but it was almost limping and walked like it was tired or hurt.  Animal lover me forgot all about skinwalkers and I started walking toward it, making the ""tch tch tch cmmeere doggy!"" noises. And then I stopped abruptly.

The dog had the body form of a greyhound, and it was grey, but there was somethhing really wrong with it.  It had bloody legs and limped, but it walked more like a person would on feet and hands, its butt was moving to and fro if that makes any sense.  When it heard me, it just stopped without turning (something I've never known any dog to do.)  And finally, it looked over its shoulder at me and this is the freaky part........this dog was looking at me the way a person does.  It had HUGE eyes....way too big for a greyhound, and its teeth were bared like it was considering biting me.  Then it growled, but it was like a whistle/growl.  Noises no regular animal makes.  It almost sounded like it wanted to talk to me or was taunting me.  

Somehow in the middle of all this I realized it didn't have a tail, and I'd heard from all the Navajo stories that skinwalkers, when they appear as animals, dont' have tails.  Fucking all logic and rationality, I turned and jetted.  I didn't look back until I was back inside the building and had pulled the doors shut behind me, and by then when I looked of COURSE the fucking thing was gone.  

When I described this to my brothers they were absolutely sure it was a skinwalker, and they went through the trouble of blessing me, my apartment, them, and their apartments.  I never saw the creepy bloody dog again, and I have never since even slightly wanted to visit cliff ruins.

My coworker, Anna, used to live in a house with a friend and the friend's husband. She lived on the first floor, while the couple lived upstairs. They had some basic paranormal stuff going on - hearing footsteps walking around, doors opening. The basement door swung open so often that it became kind of a joke to them. 

One night Anna stayed out with friends and didn't come back until the next morning. Her roommate came downstairs sometime later and said, ""Are you mad at me?"" Anna was like, ""No, why?"" 

The roommate replied, ""Last night I was trying to talk to you, and you just stood at the bottom of the stairs and glared at me.""

Anna stared at her and said, ""I wasn't home last night.""

I'm posting an old nosleep story because I'm a whore"" disclaimer.  But really, this shit scared me half to death, and I love to tell the story.  

This happened my senior year of college, Christmas break 2006. I worked for a professor that asked me to house/dog sit for him while he was outta town to see the bowl game that we were in. He was gone for three days and had a huge piece of land in the middle of nowhere. I invited my gf at the time. He had horses and fishing and a gator to ride around on, etc etc.

so the first two nights went down with no incident, but the last night, his little foofy dog is having a fit. She keeps barking at the back door. At first we blow it off, but decide to lock the dog inside in case of a coyote or something. After awhile we start to get a little creeped out. I keep saying it's probably an animal and we'll be fine. My gf (not too bright) wants to go investigate to see what's outside, so I lock the door behind her (hehe, just kidding).  She goes outside and says she saw something small and grey (probably a coyote) and it ran off. So, just an animal, no worries. but by this time, we're pretty spooked.

The dog now starts barking at the window on the other side of the house, we're still trying to ignore it, but a little worried. We decide to get into bed... awkward silence... then i hear it..... it sounds like a young girl singing a soft, eerie lullaby. I don't say anything, hoping that my mind is playing tricks on me.  My gf says, ""Let's get the fuck outta here."" I say ""Why?"" she says, ""You didn't hear that little girl singing?"" ""Ok, let's get the fuck out."" and we got the fuck out. I even called someone to talk to me while we walked out to my car. Next morning, went to clean up the house and such.

Most scared i've ever been. Ever.

Please feel free to talk and ask questions** I'm aware of the skepticism I'll be faced with, and although I can't necessarily prove my abilities, rest assured I'm completely sane and I'm being honest.

For years I've been able to contact the dead. Please believe me when I say this is not a story, and this is not a joke. This is for real. I don't know where to post it, and I wish there was a community of mediums (or whatever they're called), instead of /nosleep. Because I desperately want to meet people like me, who can see and communicate with the dead.

I can't talk to anybody about this. My mom knows of my ability, because I've spoken to her dead father a lot. He died before I was born, and our family doesn't like to talk about him. My mother doesn't believe in the paranormal, but one day in the car, I quietly asked her if my grandfather's last words to her were something along the lines of ""You never say goodbye. Always 'see you later'."" Naturally my mother flipped shit, threw the car into park in the middle of a traffic jam, and stared at me in complete disbelief. She frequently makes jokes that I should have a T.V. show. Like this ""long island medium"" or whatever. Nobody can know about this ability, hence the throwaway. Whenever I try to prove it, people are skeptics and refuse to listen to me.

No, I don't see them a lot of the time. I can, if I honestly concentrate, and ask them to be open with me. It's hard, because they all have their own quirks, like humans, and know how to fuck with people. I don't even hear them using my ears, unless they want me to. But when I sit down, by myself (or with someone that can do what I can do) in an area that's known to be haunted, and I'm quiet... It's like their world opens up to me. I don't hear them talking, only sometimes, but I get feelings and emotions from them. They tell me these things like it's being run through a fishing net. I only get bits and pieces. Like downloading a .zip file, and you extract everything from it, but some pieces are corrupted. They're not speaking to me face-to-face, but they're giving off currents of emotion that hint towards how old they are, what their name is, etc. A few different occasions, I've been able to fully contact the dead and discuss events that happened in their life with someone they knew. For example. My friend's girlfriend wanted to somehow talk to her little sibling. I knew nothing about her girlfriend or her little brother. I don't like the person to talk to me while I'm doing it. Or anybody really. I typically just close my eyes and open my mind up to them.

It got pretty scary. Until this happened, I was very skeptical about my abilities.

I was able to tell her his name, what he looked like, what he typically wore, how he died, where he died, what his babysitter looked like, acted like, how she talked, what her name was, what kind of car she drove and house she lived in. All the while, my head was down in my hands, and I was listening to her little brother. Each of them have these crazy unique personalities. Her little brother was a little monster, and threw a tantrum whenever his sister got emotional and turned the car on to leave. A big part of talking to the dead is to have everybody in the presence of the spirit to be relaxed and not afraid, because it makes them feel uneasy. Sometimes they don't even want to talk, and communicate pretty heavily that they want to be left alone. Her little brother is crazy about getting his foot in the door. He loves to talk and communicate.

So, naturally, now he follows me EVERYWHERE. It's hard to focus on the things in my every day life because he is EVERYWHERE. It's so irritating I can't even comprehend how I've stayed sane. In order to properly communicate with the deceased, you first need to be comfortable, your mind to be clear, and your head to be in the game. It's so hard sometimes when ghosts are around, and they want to talk, but I don't want to. It's like tapping on the cage of a zoo animal. All it's doing is rattling their chains. If you want to interact with a zoo animal, wait until it gets close to you. Otherwise, all you're going to do is piss it off.

Sometimes I think he doesn't like me. Like now. I can't see him, but I know he's just sitting on my bedroom floor Indian-style with his arms crossed cussing at me. He won't tell me why. He always picks stuff up and leaves it somewhere. He slams things when he throws temper tantrums. Sometimes he goes away for a day or two, but he always comes back. He's always more mad when he comes back from an absence, and I'm not sure why.

Well, I'll keep you guys updated, if my work and friends don't keep me away. I'll also try to talk to my friend who can do the same stuff I can do, just better. She'll know what to do.

One night my it was just me and my older brothers ""Jake and Mike"", Jake about 15 or 16 and mike about  10 or 11, and my oldest brothers friend steve were all outside.  I think my mom was out with friends or something.  Jake, Mike, and Steve were messing around just shooting a basketball and laughing and having a good time and I was out back playing with the dog.  It's pretty dark out as well as I was cloudy.  Across the street from the house is a field and some woods maybe 75 to 100 yards across the field.

Me and the dog bandit are having a pretty good time when I noticed that the others have stopped what they are doing and I hear my Jake call out my name, thinking he's just checking up on where I am since we have a pretty big back yard I reply with a simple yell.  All of sudden Jake scoops me up and practically throws me over his shoulder and takes off running to the house which is about 25 yards away.  I'm laughing my head off as I think its hilarious and Bandit is having a great time to.  That is until I see, I immediately stop laughing as I see this ball of light crossing the field coming from the woods.  I've never seen anything like this, it was maybe about the size of a basketball and was flashing from red, blue, orange, and yellow.  When we finally get in side Jake and Steve have just finished locking all the doors and windows and Jake grabs a shotgun my dad had left and we head up stairs.  As we are up there we can see the glow from this floating orb and all its colors when suddenly there is a bright burst of white light and we all relax thinking it's over.  Boy were we wrong.

About 30 to 45 seconds after the white light as were catching are breath we hear it.  The distinct sounds of footsteps in our gravel drive way as someone or something is walking toward the house.  We hear it move closer and closer eventually making its way to the front porch.  It than makes it way to the to the door where we hear a loud bang as if it's testing the door or something knocking on the windows.  Steve gets the idea to look out the window and immediately turns whiter than I thought humanly possible.  He didn't say it at the time but he saw the shadow as we left the front porch light on and said it didn't look right.  As all this going on Bandit has been freaking the fuck out barking non stop and it appears is trying to get out the window.  This has been going on for maybe a minute or two but seems like ages.  Finally we hear are neighbors truck start up and there's another white flash and hear the neighbor tearing ass over to our house.  

When he gets there he pretty much breaks down the door before Jake can get it open and asks if were alright.  He told us that he saw the white flash and looked out the window to investigate and saw the figure approaching the house and rushed to get dressed and had his wife call the deputy who lived down the road and have him get to our house immediately.  He said that as his wife was talking to the deputy she was looking out the window and started screaming that it was trying to get in.  With shotgun in hand Jim jumped in his truck and hauled ass over.  When Andy, the deputy that lived down the street got there, we told him what we saw and he began to look around.  What he found were to scorch marks, one in the field across the street and one behind the house the were round and shape and about three yards across.  You could also clearly see where it had been banging on the wooden the door as it slightly dented the wood a little bit and had smudged are glass windows.  He called the Sherif he came out to have a look as well.  When my mom got home I don't think I've been so happy my to see her my entire life.  I immediately hugged her and held on tight the rest of the night.  

The next day Andy, Jim, and Jake went out into those woods to see if they could find anything.  They found some weird caves and the same scorch mark by the caves but that was it.

Huge clear moon, the kind of moonlight you can read by. The road went straight along the bottom of a wide, flat, mostly barren valley, then banked up and sharply left, onto the ridge. 

It was about 10pm, and I drove through the valley on full alert, watching for animals and loving the scenery in the crazy bright moonlight. When I hit the curve and went into that sharp uphill left, I saw something through my side window. White thing. It was rapidly getting larger in my peripheral vision, as though it had been moving parallel to me, but the turn in the road meant I was now in its path. So I turned my head and looked directly.

It was white. Man-shaped but without genitals, and naked. A deathly, nauseating white with a greasy shine, completely hairless. It was *crawling*, on its hands and knees, but it was half the size of the car, and it was coming so very, very fast. It had a rubbery face, distorted by hate or a scream, black eyes that reflected the moonlight. The look on its face, I can't even tell you, I can still make myself feel sick from the memory. I believed that it was intelligent, and that it wanted to tear me apart with its teeth. The speed was horrifying, it went from being a small white spot to spitting distance in the time it took to make that turn. When I unfroze myself and hit the gas, it was on the road, and I braced for it to run into my car door. 

And then it was gone. The rearview mirror showed me nothing. I have never told anybody. I have seen a few minor glitchy/ghosty things over my many years, but nothing has ever frightened me like that. It was looking at me. And I don't know what it was.

I can't seem to find any reference to anything like it, and I would like to know if this thing is known to folklore. If another subreddit would be better to ask, just say. Thanks.

EDIT: Thank you all for the replies so far. I looked into the skinwalker and wendigo ideas, and it's a case of 'almost-but-not-quite'. Are skinwalkers ever seen without skins? Then maybe. Can wendigos be stocky instead of skinny? Then maybe. I am most intrigued by the Massachusetts story. Also, while I describe it as screaming, that's just the look on its face. I heard nothing. 

This happened in Newfoundland. Newfoundlanders have no trouble telling ghost stories, and a lot of them believe in fairies, but I've not heard of a creature like this. As for the bear idea, Newfoundland has only black bears, hell I even tried to tell myself it was a badly lost wet polar bear, but when I say the thing was crawling, I mean I could see its legs below the knee. I was very close to it by the end, and it looked like a crawling man.

I spent a lot of time in that area, and encouraged storytelling in the bar, but nothing like this ever got mentioned. But as I said, I never told this story either. The degree of fear involved somehow put it in its own category. As if it would be very, very bad luck to speak of it, because it had seen me too.

1361377825.0,131,self.Thetruthishere,18w589,[ME][FAM] My parents' haunted house. Something is there. Stories from the years.,,156,25,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18w589/mefam_my_parents_haunted_house_something_is_there/,"I always feel crazy when I say this...but it's true, and I'm certain of it.  My parent's house is haunted.  Not just your standard run-of-the-mill haunted either.  It's fantastically and terrifyingly haunted.  Here are some stories of things I've encountered as well as events that have happened to my family.  I promise you this is all true.

A little background on my parents home: It's pretty old.  Part of it is a log cabin that was built in 1850 and was used as a schoolhouse somewhere in Indiana.  In the 1910's or early 1920's this log cabin was hauled across state lines to southern Ohio by a wealthy banking family whose name a lot of people would probably recognize.  Anyway, they moved this log cabin from Indiana and added some additions - a library, a kitchen, a dining room, some extra bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.  This was in the 1920's, so one of the coolest parts of the house is that there is a speakeasy hidden in the basement.  For those of you who are unaware of what that is, a speakeasy is a room that was used for drinking illegal bootleg liquor back during prohibition.  There are two ways into this room in the basement: 1.) Through an incredibly thick wooden door in the furnace room.  It has a massive lock on it and the only way to open this thing is from the other side.  2.) There is a wooden panel in the log cabin part of the house that opens up as a tiny door with a secret staircase going down to it.  If you didn't know what you were looking for, you'd completely miss it or think it was a closet at most.

Years went by, ownership changed time and time again, but each family left their mark.  From what we understand, each owner the home had added on to the house and is now roughly double the size it was in the 1920's.  The house is pretty big, but strangely so.  It is incredibly long but only a room or two wide at its largest width which always made for really long trips if you forgot something on the other side of the house.  There is lots of wood, stone, antiques, etc. and sits back in the woods where no one can see it from the road.  It's an incredibly beautiful and unique home...but it has its secrets.  Something is definitely wrong.

We moved into this place when I was 16 years old.  I was getting ready to start my junior year of High School and was a pretty shy kid.  Not a loner by any means, but I hadn't come into my own yet and was just coming out of the awkward teenage years.  I was a good kid, didn't get into much trouble, didn't do any drugs or drink, respected my parents blah blah blah.  The day we moved in to this place, I knew something was wrong.  It just started out as that eerie feeling of someone or something watching me...it honestly felt like I was a fish in a bowl and I was being *observed*. Observed by something that I couldn't see and didn't understand...but I knew was there.

Honestly, the first year or so was okay.  Creepy, but okay.  We'd hear some small bumps in the night but just attributed it to a home that had noises we weren't used to.  The things that always seemed out of place were just chalked up to us being forgetful and the normal settling in process you go through when you move into a new home.  There was construction going on outside on a new garage and a barn, so there was always that constant noise during the day to keep your senses occupied.  Something was still off, though.  I couldn't shake the feeling that something was around us.  

My aunt moved from the northern Ohio to our area my senior year of HS.  She had taken a job in our area and needed a place to stay while her family worked on selling their house and finding one down here.  I love my aunt dearly so she was a welcome addition to our family.  As I said before, the house is unusually long.  Bedrooms are spread throughout the house.  My parents room was on one end, my sister's in the middle, and mine on the far end.  It was nice for privacy and space.  When my aunt moved in, she took the guest room next to mine.  It was nice having someone else on that end of the house...you know, since the creepy and all.  I had always heard footsteps in the house, but since I lived with three other people, I always assumed that it was them.  My aunt moving in taught me otherwise.

It was probably around 3am one morning during the summer when my aunt ran into my room freaking the fuck out. 

""T, T! (my name is going to be T for the purpose of this story), Wake up! T!"" She was panicking, big time.

""What! What?! What's wrong?"" I said in a groggy freshly woken haze

""Something is in my room! A picture fell off the wall and then my door slammed shut!""

""It was probably just the wind blowing through your window or a draft or something, don't freak out... go to bed.""

""...okay...you're probably right.  Good night."" She replied.

The next morning when I asked her what the hell that was about, she was still freaked out.  But it was summer and windows were open so she probably was imagining things, I liked to think.  She is prone to excitability and gets scared pretty easily.

A few months go by and I find out that my aunt has started to barricade her door shut at night with pillows or a small stool.  I thought that was weird, so I decided to ask her what that was about. 

""Oh, well...my door opens and slams shut around 3am every morning.  It freaks me out...and the only way I can get it stop is to put these pillows in front of it!""

That freaked me out a little bit, I'll be honest.  I sleep with a sound machine in my room because I hate dead silence, especially at my parents house, but a few times I had been woken up by a thud.  I always thought it was her going to the bathroom and closing the door a little too loudly.  Turns out it wasn't.

My parents, my sister, and I go on a trip later that summer.  My aunt doesn't go.  She's a little nervous about staying home alone at that place, but she says a bottle or two of Merlot will make everything okay.  Our trip was fantastic, but when we get home we find one terrified woman.  ""Your house is haunted.  You know that right?""  She says plainly.  ""There was some real weird shit that happened while you were gone.  I was sitting right here *points to a chair outside the kitchen near the TV* and I heard footsteps.  FOOTSTEPS I SAY!""  (again, she is very excitable)

""Are you sure?  Sure it wasn't just some weird noises or something?  Maybe the wind?""  My dad asks.

""The wind, are you serious?  It was footsteps.  I heard them every day while you were gone.  Thud.  Thud.  Thud."" She's convinced.  I believe her.

For those of you who are getting bored with this, I promise it starts getting better soon.  My dad and I started a project that following weekend.  There was a brick patio in back of the house.  Had been there since the house was built generations ago.  Beautiful old paver bricks.  My parents wanted to in a deck on the back as well as a hot tub, but didn't want the bricks to go to waste.  We decided that Dad and I would rip them up, carefully, and haul them about 200 yards away to a hill near the pond and build a new patio as well as a pergola above it.  Quality father/son bonding time.  It just so happened to be the hottest damned weekend of the year and we were miserable the entire time, but we had fun together - always will remember that.  We were thrilled with our work and how we had changed the house for the better...but something else wasn't.

That night I went to bed exhausted.  I climbed in my bed, but something seemed weird.  The air was heavy, but that wasn't the only thing.  The end of my bed had some sort of pressure on it, as if someone was sitting on it.  I slid my legs to the bottom of the bed and encountered some resistance.  I thought that it was probably just the sheets, you know how they can hang off the end of the bed put some weight on your feet.  Pulled the covers up - still was some pressure there.  I began to think that it was probably just my tired body, so I slid my legs to the right to the other side of the bed.  Nothing.  Felt perfect, just like normal.  Slid them back to the other side and it felt like I was pushing them under something sitting on the bed. I woke up later that night to my father standing in my doorway, light shining behind him.  He was standing there is his underwear with a gun.

""Quick! Get up! Someone is in the house!"" Rambo-Dad said. ""Get your bat.  We have to go look."" My mother and sister run into my room with their two coward dogs. Luckily my aunt was out of town.

I didn't ask any questions.  Just grabbed my bat and followed my old man to battle.  We didn't find anyone in the house.  Turns out that both my mom and dad were woken up in the middle of the night by a door slamming really, really loud.  This time it sounded like it was coming from the log cabin part of the house.  I came back to my room to find that both dogs had peed in my bed.  What the fuck, dogs?  They had never done anything like that before.

I glanced at my alarm clock...what time was it? 3:20AM.  The whole 3am thing really started to fuck with me.  More and more I'd find myself waking up at 3somethingAM - not sure if it was my body doing it because I was worried about that hour, or something else.  But it started to get old pretty quick.

We ended up getting a security system on the house with all of the windows and doors wired.  Dad felt better about that, but everyone else was still pretty scared.  Something was already in the house.

I went away to college and didn't come home much during that first year.  I really found myself and who I was that year.  I came home during breaks but didn't spend much time in that house for quite a while.  I spoke with my parents frequently, though.  Weird shit kept on happening, but most of it was small potatoes.  Except for this.  This truly freaks me out.

One of the original rooms in the home serves as my parents dining room.  It's a beautiful room with large windows looking out over the property and a 12 foot long antique table with a mirror surface that came with the house.  There is a chandelier in the middle of the room over the table as well as 6 wall sconces that sit on 3 walls.  One wall has a big fireplace and some shelves.  One day, the lights in that room stop working.  All of them.  Bulbs get replaces, breakers flipped, nothing is fixing it.  The electrician gets called out - he's a good family friend, so we trust him.  He does fine work.  He checked out everything and couldn't figure it out.  He told my dad that he needs to come back the next day and work and that he disconnected the electricity to each light source.  Please keep in mind that each of these lights has to be turned on separately - the chandelier is on a light switch, and each wall sconce needs to be turned on at the source.  Electricity is disconnected.  Lights are out.  Night falls and it's time to go to bed.  Apparently my father went downstairs to close up when he sees a light on...well, *lights* on.  Every single light in that dining room was on.  The next day Dad calls up the electrician.  ""Hey electrician...did you disconnect the electricity in the dining room yesterday?"" He asks.  ""Well yeah, why?"" The electrician responds.  ""Because the lights were on last night...""

""(Dad's name)...that's impossible.""

Weird things started happening more frequently in that room and it always seemed to be for a period of a few weeks after they threw a big party or if we had changed something in the house.  I got a dog my sophomore year and we came home for the summer.  The dog was great but she was very playful and really strong.  One day my mother comes up to me and says ""T, please stop moving my chairs in the dining room.  It's getting really annoying having to move them back.""

""What are you talking about, Mom?""

""You know what I'm talking about."" She said.

A few days go by, and all of a sudden I'm confronted by a VERY angry mom.  ""STOP MESSING WITH MY CHAIRS!  YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY!""

Turns out that the chairs in the room were moving around.  There are on wheels and there's a hardwood floor, but for some reason they'd all end up sprawled around the room.  In different places each time.  Mom was getting pissed.  I told her that I didn't do it.  After that she thought it was my dog after that, running around under the table moving them around.  We went back to school that fall and one day I got a phone call from my mom.

""I'm sorry I accused you of moving the chairs.  I know it wasn't you."" She said.

""Haha, oh yeah? Well thanks!  I told you it wasn't me or the dog!  Who was it?""

""The ghosts."" She said very matter-of-fact.  ""It's the ghosts.  But don't worry, they stopped.""  She then told me the story of how one day she moved the chairs back to where they should be, walked out of the room, came back 2 minutes later and the chairs were moved again.  Apparently she had come to grips with there being ghosts in the house and said the following ""I don't care if you're here.  You are welcome here...but you're scaring me and please stop moving my chairs around"".  Sure as shit, the chairs never moved again.  Lighting problems in that room kept happening, though.

Crazy things kept happening.  From time to time we'll smell pipe smoke in the library.  That's usually a tip off that something crazy is going to happen soon.  None of us smoke, but we found out that a man decades and decades ago used to smoke the fuck out of a pipe in that room.  Every so often we'll smell it, pretty heavy.  Then things happen.  For instance, one time we heard a loud slamming sound, ran in, and found 4 books from the bottom bookshelf on the floor.  5 feet away from the book shelf.  These books were on the bottom shelf, inches off the floor...and there is a small lip inside the shelf that is a real pain the butt sometimes...but somehow those books got out.  Somehow. 

Years passed, and my family came to terms with the haunted nature of the house.  We'd see shadows and once I caught a glimpse of a man in the corner of my eye.  Things continued to shoot off walls, off shelves, be in places we didn't leave them, it's just normal to them now.

I graduated college and was about a month away from marrying the love of my life.  We had just moved into a new home together.  It was Christmas Day and we were celebrating at my parents house.  My grandparents, uncle, sister and the two of were there.  Apparently the lights weren't working the day before, and mom (I know this sounds crazy) asked the ghosts if the lights could work on Christmas because she was having her family over.  It was a Christmas miracle!  The lights were on!  Hooray!  What happened next wasn't so hooray, though.

We're all eating, drinking, and telling stories around the mirrored table. The air hung heavy. The subject of the house comes up...and of course, the weird stories weren't far behind.  Mom tells everyone about the lights in the room...and that's when I got an idea.  I was feeling pretty good, just had moved the stuff out of my room and moved in with my fiancee literally days before, and wasn't super scared of the house any more.  

I challenged them.

""Hah!  If there are any ghosts in this room, turn those lights off.  I bet you can't even do it!""

Bad idea.  Every single light in that room shut off the instant I finished my sentence. The chandelier, each of the 6 wall lights that need to be turned off individually, all of them.  The only thing that didn't turn off was the radio.  The air hung heavier.

Naturally, we all start screaming because it was really fucking scary.  Even my badass grandparents were freaking out.

I yelled out ""OKAY! YOU WIN! I'M SORRY!""

Power on.  All of the lights came back on.  This time we didn't scream...everyone was too afraid to make a noise.  Dinner ended shortly after.

Got married the next month, life is grand, years go by.

My mom calls up one day and tells me that she met a paranormal investigative team and that they are going to bug the house and do one of those paranormal investigative things.  She invited me to be there when they do it, but I didn't want anything to do with that crap.  Keep me out of it.  They did it for free, so there wasn't any scamming or anything going on.

I did, however, go to the ""reveal"" where they show evidence and all that.  There were some really creepy pictures, shadow people, terrifying noises that sounded like ""rape and murder and body in the field"" and a whole bunch of other stuff.  If I can get the pics from my mom I'll try to put them up.  One of the people on the team claims to be able to feel energy or whatever, and basically she told us that our house is the most pants-shittingly haunted place she has ever been.

That ""psychic"" lady knows some person who works at A&amp;E on one of those ghost programs...and they called to ask my parents if they could use their home for a show.

Of course, they declined.  Resale value and all. ;)  

I don't know what's in that house, but I know it's something.  More than one something.  Sometimes it's playful, other times it's spiteful, but it always is creepy.

I know this is long, but thanks for putting up with my rambling and listening to my story!  This is my first post on Reddit, so apologies if I've screwed something up.

EDIT:  Forgot to include this.  My mom claims that there is a spirit of some sort that is haunting *her*.  It's really hard to explain, but she'll wake up in the middle of the night and swear someone is next to her bed.  I don't *think* she's crazy, but she claims it's taking her energy or something.  A lot of bad things have happened to her accident-wise over the last few years, so who knows.  I hope it's just bad luck.  Oh yeah, the shadow people pictures are always in her room.  So that sucks.

EDIT: HOW AM I FORGETTING THIS STUFF?!

Anyway, about a month ago I get a call from my mom.  She is freaking out big time, saying there is someone in the house.  She said she heard the alarm system say 'Zone 48, open', which means something opened.  It's the middle of winter, Dad's out of town, she's freaking out and in her car calling me.  I drive over with my wife and my sister, who was over hanging out with my wife.  We live about 15-20 minutes away so it wasn't a big deal.

I get out of the car, turn my cell phone on and put it in my front shirt pocket just in case.  I have a gun.  I go through their house, clearing it room by room, and I get to the library...suddenly... pipe smoke.  **Heavy air**.  *Oh shit*. I keep going through the library into the log cabin and I get the most distinctive feel that something is there and is NOT happy about my being in their home.  All of my hairs stand on end, and there is a very strong feeling of anger in the room.  All of a sudden I hear my wife over the phone freaking out.  ""DoctorGoop! DoctorGoop! ARE YOU OKAY WHERE ARE YOU WHERE ARE YOU?""  ""Shut up!"" I said to my wife with love. ""You're going to give me away""!

I get through the rest of the house.  No one is there...living, at least.

As I walk out the front door, my wife sister and mother are all standing there with their hands over their mouths in horror.  They explain to me that right before they started freaking out and yelling at me through the phone, they heard the most terrifying dark and twisted sounds they have ever heard coming through the phone. They said it was what they would image the devil or a demon would sound like. This was my cell phone connected to my wife's.  We tried to recreate the sound but couldn't to save our lives.

When we told my dad about it, he got very quiet.  He has heard that exact same sound when using their home phone to call people.  He has also heard it on HIS cell phone.  Freaks me out.

I got the little book the alarm company gives you that explains which zones are which...Zone 48...the one my mom heard open...was a window in the library, where I smelled the pipe smoke and felt the hate and heard my family freaking out through the phone.  That's the room where something tried to communicate through my phone.  That's the room that has its windows painted shut.  They don't open.

Not sure how I forgot about that....kind of wish I had forgotten for good.

1356984926.0,134,self.Thetruthishere,15qm9o,[ME+FAM] My childhood experiences in a haunted Victorian home.,Kidthink,160,26,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/15qm9o/mefam_my_childhood_experiences_in_a_haunted/,"I've had several people request this, so I am going to do my best to tell my story. Feel free to ask questions, or to not believe me. I know most people don’t, unless they’ve had similar experiences. Sorry in advance if this is really long – I hope it’s worth the read!

My parents, my two older sisters, my older brother and I moved into an old Victorian house in a poor neighborhood in the fall of 1996. The house is over 150 years old, and was often used as 3 separate living spaces (2 upstairs, 1 downstairs), so it has had its fair share of tenants. A few months after arriving, the old man who lived across the street told us a scary story. His family has lived in that house for generations (there’s 3 generations living there now – it’s a little weird). He said that when he was a kid, the upstairs tenant in the front bedroom at my parents’ house killed herself. She was a single woman who never had visitors, so no one found her body until her rent was late. Sure enough, when we tore out the shag carpet, we found a body-shaped warped spot on the floor. He also told us that an old woman died in the kitchen, but I haven’t been able to find any more information on that.

In 1998, my sister had some friends over for her 14th birthday party. As the night wore on, they decided to hold a séance. They lit candles and attempted to contact George Washington – I assume that was the first dead person they could think of. What came through the board did not identify as George. “He” said his name was Johnny. He was a teenager, and he had grown up in the neighborhood. He said he knew the girl who killed herself upstairs. One of the girls at the party had a mother battling cancer. She asked Johnny if her mother was going to die soon. “YES.” “How soon?” “T-W-O-D-A-Y-S.” The girl started crying, assuming someone in the room was moving the cursor and being mean. So she told Johnny to prove he was real, and all the candles in the room were blown out. Needless to say, the séance ended immediately. Two days later, the girl’s mom died.

After the birthday party, “Johnny” didn’t leave. My sister’s bedroom was upstairs, directly next to the room the past tenant was said to have died in. She kept waking up to the sounds of a man trying to get the bedroom window open, and other disturbing things as well. One night, as she was trying to fall asleep, there was a loud scraping noise from inside the closet. [Now, the closet has a removable panel in the top that opens into the attic. There’s a fully functional attic ladder in the hallway, so there is no real reason for this panel to be there. The only reason we have come up with is that the closet, along with the antique murphy beds next to it, makes up the shape of what used to be butler stairs. So it’s possible that panel closed off the stairwell.] The scraping sound turned into knocking. Then she heard what she describes as sounding like many voices – like when someone uses a toy voice changer – saying, “…We’re watching you.” As she ran downstairs screaming, she said the voice started laughing. My dad went upstairs with the gun as soon as he heard the screaming, but there was no one in the closet. 

Johnny, or whatever it was upstairs, really did not like my mom. She would go upstairs to clean, only to be greeted with loud slamming noises. On one occasion, the old rotary phone sitting on the arm of the couch (in the front room the past tenant died in) was hurled across the room at her head; she ducked and it hit the wall behind her. It didn’t fall naturally, because it would have had to go up from the arm of the couch to hit her head. There was also an old mirror in my sister’s bedroom that had been there when we moved in.  We would find it lying on the floor after being hung up repeatedly. My mom saw it come off the wall, slide to the floor, fall on its face, and slide across the room.

When these things started happening, I was about 10. My parents didn’t know how to handle the situation (they’ve always said you should ignore it and never look into the paranormal), so they did their best to keep me in the dark about what was going on. All I knew at the beginning was that I was terrified to try to sleep at night. My trusty black cat, with whom I shared my blanket and pillow, would wake me by hissing and growling at things I couldn’t see. He would get to the point that he would stand over me, hissing, arching his back and swiping at air. My bedroom door would also creak open by itself, and I often saw black shapes in the hallway.

After awhile, my mom got a part-time job. My 12 year-old brother and I were still homeschooled, so this left us at home alone for a good portion of the day. There were many, many times that I became utterly convinced someone was breaking into the house. Doors would slam, specific stairs would creak, and more importantly, I heard men in hard-soled shoes walking around and talking upstairs. The talking was loud, but also muffled and unintelligible. It always sounded like two men in the front bedroom. I would shove myself under the couch for hours, or hide in the closet, waiting for my mom to get home.  [14+ years later, my brother swears he doesn’t remember any of this happening, even though he was scared enough to hide with me several times.] One day when we were home alone, one of our friends who lived up the street stopped by. He asked, “Is your Grandma visiting?” I said, “No, why?” he said, “Then who’s the old woman sitting in your kitchen? I saw her from the window.”

On another occasion, my sister L was looking for my sister H, and thought she heard H in the basement. She went downstairs and saw H run behind the furnace. The furnace sat in the middle of the room and was a massive, cast iron beast. L takes off running and laughing, chasing H around the basement for several minutes, thinking they were playing. She eventually stopped when she realized H wasn’t even home.

Another time, the police showed up at the front door. My mom and I were the only ones home. The police told my mom that someone had called 911 from our home phone, screamed and hung up. They all asked me if I had done it, but that is something I would never have done.

One day, my mom, brother and I went grocery shopping. When we came home, my brother checked the caller ID. We had missed over 200 calls in the short time we were gone – and they were all from famous names like Adolf Hitler, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, etc. We grabbed a disposable camera and tried to take pictures of the caller ID, but none of them came out. This could’ve been someone hacking our phone somehow I’m sure, but it was weird nonetheless.

Things went on this way for months. If I had to guess, I’d say 9 months. To this day, my parents get mad at me for bringing this stuff up, so they won’t really confirm my timeline. My mom, at her wit’s end, called up a friend and confessed the haunting to her over the phone. The friend said she had experience with this sort of thing, and they prayed together over the phone. I remember specifically that the friend prayed for “a hedge of protection around the house.” After that phone call, things seemed to calm down a bit. I still heard voices and saw shapes, but doors slammed less often and it seemed the rest of my family didn’t experience anything. I remained terrified of the attic and the basement, and I refused to be in the upstairs bedrooms alone.


I have read a lot on the subject since then, and I have found that several things can trigger experiences like this; two fairly common triggers are living with people in the throes of puberty, and remodeling the home. My siblings and I were 10, 12, 14 and 18 when things really took off, and my parents were furiously remodeling the home. Every time we tore out the lathe and plaster in the walls, we found more items. In my dad’s office, we found a bloodstained nightgown and work gloves shoved inside the wall. In the front bedroom upstairs, we found a brittle old whip, tons of un-cashed checks, and a weird, pornographic, pedophiliac flipbook from the early 1900s.

The strange happenings remained on such a level that they could be ignored, until about 2001. One afternoon, I was home alone and listening to music on the computer in the living room. I was rocking out especially hard, drumming on the desk, and I twirled in the computer chair. As I twirled, I saw a man standing in the doorway to the kitchen on the left side. He was wearing a dark hat – **EDIT:** [just found out it's called a ""Low Topper Hat""](http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/thumblarge_704/1343910323lq2C5c.jpg), and either he was wearing dark clothing, or his body was just black. He was Caucasian, but his skin looked tan and leathery. He had salt &amp; pepper mutton chops. He made eye contact with me, squatted down, and ran across the living room as my chair spun. He ran through the wall and into the hallway closet. It took a few seconds for me to come to grips with what I had seen, at which point I became convinced he was hiding in the closet. So I went outside and sat on the front porch for several hours until my mom got home. I told my mom about the man, but she said my eyes must’ve been playing tricks on me (of course), so I didn’t tell anyone else about him.

The entire time I lived in that house, I continued having experiences. Things disappearing and turning up later, knocks and slams, my cat hissing, things falling off shelves when they should’ve been secure, muffled voices. I continuously had nightmares, and one night terror. During the night terror, I saw what looked a lot like Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York crawling up my bed towards me (it could’ve been the man from the living room, I suppose). I felt my bed shake and felt his hands on my legs. His eyes reflected light from the bedroom window. I kept my eyes shut until his grip went away. At one point, I took one of the Murphy bed frames and tried to use it for my own bed downstairs. I put the frame on the curb outside in less than a week because I was continuously waking up to the bed shaking.

On one occasion, my sister had friends stay the night after drinking. One of them slept on the floor, and in the morning kept complaining that people were trying to spoon him. No one had been spooning him. He was sleeping on the warped spot on the floor.

On another occasion, I had friends over and we slept in the living room downstairs. My sister came downstairs livid that we were “playing tricks on her” and told us to stay out of her room. She said she was awake when we three were standing over her bed laughing and whispering. My friends and I hadn’t gone upstairs a single time that night.

My sister L and I had another experience in 2002. She wanted to see the abandoned old folks’ home my friends and I hung out at a lot, so we took her. That night, I distinctly remember feeling like something followed us home. For whatever reason, she slept in my bed that night and I slept in my walk-in closet that I had cleared out; I left the door to the closet open and slept in a sleeping bag. During the night, I woke up terrified. In the top corner of my closet, there was a massive black shape – just the deepest, darkest black – it had density. It had no real shape, and no face, but I could feel it staring at me. I also had the feeling that if I tried to get up and run, it was going to shut the closet door. So I laid still and tried to ignore it. I prayed over and over, and after a very long time, I fell back to sleep. The closet door remained open. 

While I slept, I had a dream about being upstairs in the rear bedroom. In the dream, I realized I was upstairs alone, panicked, and made a run for the bedroom door. As I ran, all of the cabinets in the attached kitchenette swung open violently. When I opened the door to run out, I ran directly into a man’s chest. He was wearing a black, woolen, double-breasted suit jacket with gold buttons. I also remember the color baby blue, but I don’t know why. I looked up, and he had no face. I pushed back from him and started to scream as my sister woke me up. She said, “Dude, I just had the weirdest thing happen.” She had been playing the piano at the bottom of the stairs (Moonlight Sonata, which is terrifying to begin with, haha) when she heard someone tapping along to the music on the bannister above her. She looked up and saw a man watching her – he ducked back as soon as she looked up. She ran upstairs to see if our brother was playing tricks on her, only to find that he was still asleep. That’s when she ran downstairs and woke me up -  at the same time I ran into the man in my dream. I asked her to describe the man she saw. Top hat, white guy with tan skin, mutton chops and a dark suit jacket. She perfectly described the man I saw in the living room months before.

She moved out shortly after seeing the man. I remained in the house until 2009, and although things calmed down considerably, I never felt alone in that house. I still saw shadows and heard things. Contrary to most hauntings I’ve researched, most of our phenomenon happened in the middle of the day, not during the night. My parents still don’t like to talk about it, although they will admit that this all happened after a couple of glasses of wine. My brother still lives at home. He has sworn off my parents’ religion, and has even gone out of his way to try to “summon” various things in his bedroom (the room the previous tenant died in). Nothing ever came of his attempts, to his knowledge. I’d rather not go into many details about my brother, because it’s private and it would be very easy for him to find this post. Suffice to say, I don’t believe his attempts were unsuccessful, and I believe the house is still active. I will mention that I went to check on him one night after hearing slamming sounds for more than 30 minutes. He answered his bedroom door with his face red and his forehead scratched up, acting unnaturally angry. The next day, there was a massive hole in the bedroom wall. My parents weren’t pleased, hah.

Little things still happen anytime I visit home, but I live states away and don’t get to visit very often. If anything does happen at home when I am not there, I wouldn’t know, because my parents and brother are not the kind of people to want to talk about it.

I’m sure there are other little events that I am missing. If they come to mind, I will add them in edits later. I just wrote down everything I could think of – it has been a very long time since I have shared all of this information, because most people don’t want to hear about it and I end up feeling self-conscious.

I’d also like to mention that I have spent hours and hours trying to find out more about the history of my parents’ house, on the off chance that I can find out who this man with the mutton chops is. I’ve found a lot of general info, but nothing about the previous tenants yet. I am visiting home next week, and I have all the information I need to get a copy of the Historic Deed. If I manage to find anything interesting soon, OP will deliver. Thank you if you read this whole thing, and feel free to ask anything you want, as I’m sure my writing isn’t the best.

**EDIT:** Not really necessary information... but after re-reading my post, something just occurred to me for (surprisingly) the first time ever. My sister and I both saw the same man when there was music involved. That little tidbit of information might help me find out who he was, if he was a musician.


**EDIT:** I just returned from my visit home. After 3 days spent in the Recorder of Deeds office at the courthouse and various genealogical libraries, I have a ton of information; we even traced the house back to 1891. So it may be slightly younger than previously thought. But, with the exception of a couple of small gaps, I have the names of all of the owners of the house from 1891-2012. So I'm now taking all of that information onto ancestry.com and finding the house owners in other people's family trees, in hopes of getting more information about their deaths, and possibly even photos. I'll update soon if I get more info!



**EDIT 2-21-13:** I have been too busy to continue my research, but I am moving back home and will be unemployed when I get there, so the research will be picking back up. 

I did find out something I found awesome. The house used to face 90 degrees counter-clockwise, and had a different address from the 1800s until just before 1910. The front door used to be on that side of the house, and I actually found a photo that shows where the front door used to be, complete with the sidewalk and steps running up to it. The front door used to be in the EXACT spot that I saw the man run through the wall in the living room. So to him, he saw me and panicked, and ran out *the front door*, not through a wall. It gives me a better idea of when he would have lived there, but I haven't been able to progress further yet because of life getting in the way. I hope to have more info soon.

OH! And I also found out that the same family lived there from the 1890s until the 1940s, with several generations growing up in the house. The head of the house was an English immigrant who worked as a tailor. My mother is now a tailor and clothing designer with her own store. We found the address of this man's tailor shop in a newspaper listing - SAME ADDRESS as my mom's shop, 100 years later!

I came from r/nosleep (still subscribed there too) as I was drawn to the fact that many of the accounts here were supposedly of factual experiences.

Whether or not this was the case, the culture here was one that these stories of encounters were treated as such, and therefore had a rather compelling angle to them. 

One of my fascinations (though as a sceptic I take everything with a grain of salt) is the unexplainable, and finding a subreddit that documented these accounts (even if they were not written like an award winning novel, or were not packed with heart chilling content) was a great bonus in my quest to further understand this underworld of existence.

r/nosleep began to lose it's shine for me when I started reading too many stories that were obvious fiction. I understand the place of fiction, but I also value the role of true accounts of what people may have experienced.

So my point is... migration from r/nosleep means the likelihood of stories being actual accounts of experiences diminishes due to the prevailing culture of the scare, plot and structure (as per the usual horror story) being of significant importance. After all, how do we police this? Who is to decide that someone's account of something that actually took place is not just good fiction?

This is all just a thought, and I'm happy to wander elsewhere to find what I found here if the prevailing culture changes direction in a way that doesn't suit me.

But I feel it's important to have a space to share actual accounts of the unexplainable, to try and understand these phenomena without adding to the confusion by the generation of fiction....

Have at thee!

EDIT: Thanks for all the thoughts and input guys, sometimes it shocks me a little that people can be civil on the internet, even when they have divergent views.

1369914409.0,126,self.Thetruthishere,1fbxc7,[ME] Odd Story From My Stay in a Small Town (x-post from /r/AskReddit),Vanimity,148,22,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1fbxc7/me_odd_story_from_my_stay_in_a_small_town_xpost/,"Hi, I posted this story yesterday on /r/AskReddit and a user asked me to cross-post it here. It's a bit long, but a good one. This is my first time on /r/TheTruthIsHere and I love that there is active speculation on a reasonable explanation of what actually happened to me. I welcome it and will offer my own explanation later today when I get home from work. Link to original post after the story.

Story:

In 2007 I finished college and was offered a posting as an admin in a small town working with local law enforcement. It was a 6-month contract and paid really well so all within a week I accepted the job, found a furnished place to live and took off for my adventure.

The town had just over 15,000 people and the apartment I chose was on the top floor of a three-storey building that was built in the 1960s. It was quite large and had nice hardwood floors. The walls were somewhat thin and I heard my neighbour a few times, especially at night when it was quiet. When I first got there I knocked a few times with the intention to introduce myself but they never answered even though I thought I had heard them inside. After a week I assumed maybe it was a reclusive person so I slipped a note under the door saying hello.

I worked with the same officers all the time on rotating shifts and three weeks into my stay I was into the afternoon shifts which meant I was getting home around 2am. As I came down the hallway of the building I saw a light coming from under my neighbour's door and saw the shadow of feet under the door and the peephole went dark as if they heard me and were looking to see who was in the hall. I figured if they wanted to say hello they would have opened the door so I simply waved hello and went into my apartment. Over the next couple of weeks this happened 3-4 times again. I was pretty sure I had a reclusive but nosy neighbour.

Then one night after work I crawled into bed at 3am and could hear that my neighbour was moving around in the room of theirs that adjoined my bedroom. About ten minutes later the noises got louder and it started to get me worried. They had never been this loud and it almost sounded as if they were being attacked or having a heart attack and knocking things over. I ran out of the apartment and started knocking loudly on their door but they didn't answer. I called out to them saying I was worried about them and if they didn't answer I would call for help. Still no answer. I ran back into my apartment and could hear bangs through the wall so I called the police station and asked my co-worker to send an officer over. I went and knocked on my neighbour's door one more time but no answer and then headed down to the lobby to wait for the officer who showed up within 5 minutes. I had gotten to know him a bit and we went up and knocked on the door but still no answer. I took him into my apartment and we could still hear loud thumps every 5-10 seconds and then a huge bang. The officer asked if I could go get the building manager to open the door. She lived one block away so I said I'd run over and get her. Luckily she was a night owl and watching TV. I told her that my neighbour was being really loud and wouldn't answer the door so she grabbed the keys and we headed over. The officer was waiting for us in the lobby and she asked which apartment it was and I told her 304. She looked at me weirdly and said 304 was empty. I said I had heard my ""neighbour"" making noise nearly every day and had seen the light on and shadows under the door a few times. The officer said he heard the noises too and asked if 304 was the apartment that was above the carport and she said yes. He replied that someone could easily climb up onto the carport and perhaps there were squatters in the empty apartment. We went up and the manager unlocked the door and the officer opened it. The apartment was dark and he turned the light on. He went in and the manager and I were peaking in through the doorway. He went into the bedroom and came back out and said it was empty. We went in and the place was spotless. All but two of the windows were locked and no sign of squatters. We all just stood there scratching our heads. The officer looked at me and said ""You're not crazy, I heard the banging too"". I said maybe we scared them off and they had come and gone through the unlocked windows. We double-checked that all windows were locked and headed out. On our way out I looked down, and there on the floor was the note I had slipped under the door a few weeks earlier. We locked the apartment and I said I'd keep an eye out and call them both if I ever again saw the light on or heard noises.

Fast forward almost six weeks and I was again on afternoon shifts. I came home at 2am and there was a light on. I quickly went into my bedroom and could hear thumping from next door. I called the station and asked for an officer to come out and then called my building manager. I slipped down to the lobby and waited for them. A different officer showed up and I knew him too. My building manager arrived and all three of us headed upstairs. The light was off and the building manager unlocked the door. The officer went in and everything checked out. We checked the windows again and they were still all locked. I apologized and tried to rationalize it that I had just come off of four days of 14-hour shifts and was tired, but I knew I had seen the light on and heard thumping.

Two weeks later the apartment was rented out and I got a chance to greet my new neighbours. I told them to keep an eye out because we were sure squatters had been coming in and out and I relayed the stories to them.

My final week there, the station had a BBQ and we were talking about the squatters that no one ever saw. I told the first officer about the second call out and how all the windows were locked that time but I knew I had seen the light on and heard thumping next door. He asked if I wanted to hear something ""funny""? and I said sure. He said he was going to tell me earlier but didn't want to freak me out. He proceeded to tell me that three months before I moved in, he personally responded to a call to my neighbour's apartment for a very bloody suicide. The person had done the deed but had second-thoughts and called for help. When they arrived the person was unconcious but had obviously panicked and a chair, lamp and side table had been knocked over and there was blood everywhere. Unfortunately, they passed away before getting to the hospital. I just stared at him and he reminded me he had heard the banging too the night I called him over.

I asked the building manager about it the day I moved out and asked why she hadn't told me. She laughed and said ""Oh honey, I believe in ghosts but didn't know if you did too and I didn't want to scare you. I know you heard and saw things. I believe you and I doubt it was squatters"".

1362530305.0,126,self.Thetruthishere,19qreg,[ME] My camping trip.,jbark97,149,23,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/19qreg/me_my_camping_trip/,"So a while ago, when I was a teenager (~14 years old), I went on one of those camping trips that various companies offer during the summer. It was me, 9 other kids, and two counselors (who were only 5 or 6 years older than us kids). It was in the Pacific Northwest (of the USA). Washington, if I remember correctly. So anyway, every day  we would hike, and then, after the hike was over, we would hop back into our van (with U-Haul attached on the back) and head to a campground. We usually stayed at campgrounds that were pretty heavily populated (KOA's and the like), but this one night we went to a campground where we were one of two groups of people. The other occupants were a young married couple. To start off with, and what really caught me by surprise, was that the campground was in the middle of the thickest forest I have ever been in. I legitimately could not see fifty feed ahead of me when walking around during the daytime (at night it was obviously much worse). 

Fast forward to dinner time that night. As we are all munching on our food, one girl says that she has to go to the bathroom. Since it is nighttime, and there are nighttime animals walking around everywhere doing their thing, we have to go in groups to go to the bathroom. I volunteer to go, as does another guy. The bathroom is approximately 200 yards away from our campground, so it's a bit of a walk. The sun is near done setting as we arrive at the bathroom. The girl goes in and does her business. As the other guy and I are waiting for her, we decide that it's probably smarter to go to the bathroom now, rather than going in the middle of the night. So we're in there, and I, having just finished going to the bathroom, am washing my hands. The other camper is in the stall. There are two sinks. All of a sudden, the one I'm not using turns on. I think this is weird, but it turns off after a couple seconds. Whatever, I think, weird shit like that happens all the time. No biggie. So, the other guy finishes up, and we go out and continue to wait for the girl (it took her like 15 or 20 minutes, she must've been constipated or something). Finally she comes out, and as we're about to walk back (it's pretty dark now) she says, ""There was a woman in the bathroom with me"" we respond with, ""So what? probably just that other woman in the other campground"" ""No."" she says, ""the woman in the bathroom was middle-aged. The other camper is like 20"". ""Probably just another camper we didn't know about"" says the other guy"". ""It can't be"", I say, "" this campground is tiny. We are definitely the only two groups here. Whatever"", I say, quickly dismissing the notion so as not to freak myself out,  ""we should get back, we've been gone a long time"". They agree, and we keep going. At the back of my mind, though, I'm getting kind of scared. Some weird shit is going on. As we keep walking, it gets *very* dark. I'm not saying it is a weird dark, just that, because there aren't any cities near us, there is no glow to light up the night sky. So naturally, it is pitch black. (which is scary by itself, I would say). The girl turns around and notices a light behind us. It appears to be a flashlight. ""Whatever, it's probably just the other campers"" by this time, we are at their site, and lo and behold, both of them. We look back, and the flashlight is out. It just disappeared. But there are definitely footsteps. I mouth the words, ""do you hear footsteps too?"". They both nod. We give each other a quick glance, and start sprinting back to the campsite. It's a short sprint, and we soon arrive there, ready to tell our story. I guess we trusted that we had outrun the footsteps or something, because I for one felt completely safe back at the campground. 

For all the people who are reading this and saying, ""this is just BS. not paranormal or scary at all."" Well, here's the part where it gets scary. 

We slept in four tents (there were four girls and five guys, so two guys' tents and one girls' tent, as well as the counselors'). They were all relatively near each other, all within 10 meters, I would say. So we are all trying to fall asleep (the previous ""flashlight encounter"" had completely slipped my mind by now). We are talking, as kids do, when suddenly... footsteps. The same speed as the ones before that we had heard. My tentmates start making some noise (like, ""what the fuck was that"", etc...), but I shush them. We remain very silent, just listening. After a while they go away. It was weird, it seemed like they were just walking in place, they never got farther away from the tents. Whatever was following us left, right? wrong. As we begin to ease back into sleep, and start to doze off, I hear the worst, most horrifying cackle/laugh you can imagine (think the opening of ""Feel Good Inc."" by the Gorillaz, just 10 times more scary). I whisper to my tentmates if they hear it. They nod. Then, I shit you not, the sound of a faucet running. It all comes rushing back to me now, the sink ""magically"" turning on, the footsteps. We sit there in silence for what felt like an hour (probably was only like 5 minutes), until a girl's voice tentatively asks, ""did you guys hear that?"" I say, ""y-y-yes"". Everybody's whispering to each other now. ""The fuck was that?"" ""I'm so scared right now"", etc... even the counselors joined in. Then, out of nowhere, the loudest siren on the planet earth goes off. (I'm sure you've heard one of those bombing-raid sirens they have in cities before; this was very similar). A siren? in the middle of nowhere Washington? This can't be happening. It goes on for roughly a minute or two, then cuts off. After that, one of the counselors quietly says, ""Let's get in the van guys"". I don't know how on Earth I summoned up the courage to walk the 10 meters to the van, but I did. As soon as we got in, everybody is freaking the fuck out. Not screaming, just a stunned silence. We all confirm that we heard all of the noises (the faucet, the footsteps, the siren, and the cackle), and then the three of us who went to the bathroom bring up our previous ""encounter"". By now, we're like, ""Well, I guess this is it. We're fucked. Nice knowing you"". We turn the lights of the van off, and as we do, we notice that the couple who were camping next to us had the good sense to get the fuck out of that campground. This, as you might suspect, makes us feel a hell of a lot worse, given that we are now officially the only people here. And then, out of nowhere, someone says ""wait. is that a person?"" I look out the window, and, sure enough, there is a figure walking in the road. ""Everybody, be as quiet as possible"" we say, because this person (or whatever it is) definitely won't see the van full of kids right next to the road. The funny thing is though, only like half of us can see it. One counselor, and about 5 of the 9 of us. The others say, ""yeah right, stop playing jokes you guys"". But we insist. There is a thing walking in the road, coming towards us. As it gets nearer, I make out the figure of a woman who looked to be about 40 years old or so. Fuck. The girl who had to go to the bathroom has seen her before. I nearly faint, I am so scared. I probably pissed myself, too. Then suddenly, she vanishes. ""what happened? where did it go?"" still, half of us never saw the thing, and didn't believe us. Nothing else happened that night, and we all gradually fell asleep. 

The next morning. I wake up thinking it was just a nightmare, but I'm in the van. We all confirm that this all actually happened. We all realize that it definitely did happen, and we get the fuck out of there as quickly as possible. We didn't even eat breakfast. To this day, I have no idea what the fuck any of that was: the siren, the woman, the faucet. Nothing. hearing my roommates walk around our house as I'm trying to fall asleep at night still scares the fuck out of me.

On my way to work tonight (12am to 8am) I noticed something a little strange on the side of the road that I don't normally see on this trip.

I have to use the backroads to get to the interstate so that I can get from where I live in the sticks to the city where I work. Its not a very long trip but is pretty boring considering there isnt much scenery other than the rows of woods on the side of the road the whole way. But I make this trip on a regular basis and it is usually uneventful.

Now maybe this happend because I have been browsing reddit for a while and have gotten integrated into the community of people who seem to see scary stuff on a regular basis. But I know that I never had a need to get an account and post anything until what happend tonight. 

As I said it was a normal drive to work until my headlights hit something that looked a little out of the ordinary. Now I wasn't worried at first because it is normal to see stray dogs walking around on the roads. But this one was different, and I didn't know why until I got closer. As I was driving up to it I noticed it was walking a little funny. Almost like a human would if they were on all fours and trying to run. I say human because as I pulled up (slowing down to really get that scary movie thing going) until it was about 20ft from the car, I noticed its legs were moving at odd angles to move this thing forward. 

Now the body was about the size of a mid-sized dog but the legs were more like four arms that were longer than any legs on a dog that I have ever seen. And the way it was swinging them forward to where they came parrallel to the ground was the weirdest part. But I soon didn't have time to really analyze because it had notice that I had taken interest and it had done the same to me. It started swinging its arms at full sprint towards the car. I never accelerated so fast in my life. But as I said before these were backroads and hence there are no streetlights. So I had no idea where this thing was once my headlights were past it. I was going so fast that I had to slow down to make a turn that was coming up. I didn't know where it was until the low glow of red from my tailights lit this thing up that was now chasing my car down the road. Needless to say I didn't slow down again until I got to the interstate. 

I guess it didn't like being around other cars because I did not see it at all for the rest of the trip. But I definitely want to find out what exactly this thing was doing when I came up to it on the side of the road. It will be daylight when I drive home so hopefully it doesn't like the sun.

He was robbed and shot, and I can't begin to explain what a horrible time in my life that was. My mom started going in and out of mental hospitals. She had to be sedated the night of the day he died. We lost our business. We lost our home. We lost everything. My kid brother and I slept in the bed with my mom for years--he was six when my dad died and I was nine. I used to lie awake at night, terrified. My eyes would dart from the door to the bathroom door to the closet door, for hours. I was terrified of someone breaking into the house. I had nightmares about tornadoes every night for years--I still have tornado nightmares sometimes, at twenty-five. I still have some of that paranoia, too. 

This happened to me one night, not long after he died. More than a month, but less than a year. My mom, my brother, and I were lying in bed. My mom had the radio on and it was playing ""It's All Coming Back to Me"" and she was crying. She was trying not to wake us up, but I hadn't been to sleep yet. I looked over at her, and my father was rubbing her legs (she always had leg trouble and needed nightly massages, which he did every night until he died and I did after that.) Then he stood up from where he was sitting and turned into an amorphous shape of light. He drifted into the closet and disappeared. From then on, I was never again afraid of the closet. I sat straight up and asked my mom if she had seen him. Of course she hadn't. 

Maybe it was nothing, just a dream by a kid who was traumatized by losing her father. But I've never believed that. To this day, when folks ask me if I believe in ghosts, I tell them this: I have seen the spirit of my father. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1cu4b0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1cu4b0/the_night_my_father_told_my_mom_goodbye/,

My friend and I go to a meditation group together once a week, and since it is in the next town over, we always meet at a grocery store and drive together. Next to the grocery store in the strip mall was a pizza parlor. It closed down last year and a new one opened up in the same spot. After our group, we usually get back to the parking lot around 11:30 pm or so. Just to let you know, the store closes at 11 pm and all the other places in the strip mall (including the pizza place) close at 9 pm.

So one night we get back to the parking lot at around 11:30 pm as usual and I am driving to my friend's car and we pass in front of the pizza place. My friend tells me to look inside, and there are all these teenagers just sitting around in the pizza parlor. That doesn't sound too weird, but they were all staring in different directions. None were talking or moving or anything. There were about 15 or 20 of these teenagers.

There are no food or drinks, there is no one standing up or talking, and there was no tv on. And as I said, they were all staring blankly in different directions. We watched for a few minutes, and nothing changed.

Needless to say, my friend and I were a bit freaked out and left ASAP. As I was driving out of the parking lot, I passed by again and they were still the same way. That pizza place was closed the next time we came by.

We really are greatful this happened.*

My wife and I were living at my Grandma’s house *it’s a very large house* and we had the entire upstairs. My wife and I were in the master bedroom and our 3 month old daughter was in a front bedroom across the hall from us. We had one of those new fancy baby monitors that has the breathing sensor and all that. Primarily, if our daughter tossed wrong this stupid thing went off, but we kept on with it as we were new parents.

One night while trying to go to sleep, my wife and I were lying in bed talking about the weeks’ happenings. Basically just shooting the shit till we got tired enough to go to sleep. We finally stopped talking and were ready to sleep so we turned up the baby monitor so it would be loud enough to wake us if the alarm sounded, or if our daughter started crying for one reason or another. 

As I lay there trying to nod off, I heard what I thought was breathing over the monitor adult breathing. It was kind of distorted, like bad reception. So I would listen more carefully to be sure it wasn’t malfunctioning. I heard my daughter moving around, and that came through clear. So I figured it was just some interference with the monitor. However, a few moments later I heard clear as day over the monitor an older woman’s voice saying ”SHhhh, it’s ok.” In a very soft and almost comforting tone. However, being a new father living where we did I freaked out. 

Leaping out of bed thinking that someone is in my daughter’s room about to kidnap her or something, I ran through the hall and burst into her room. Her room was near pitch black but for the little toy thing we had on her crib. It would give a constant soft glow, and if there was noise be it a kick, or crying it would turn on and move and play soft music. That was on *in the middle of its song*, my daughter appeared sound asleep and no one was in the room.

Figuring I must have dreamt the voice, I walked over to pick up my daughter to comfort her *and myself at this point*. When I picked her up, I noticed she was very very warm. I checked her temperature and it was a dangerous 103 degrees. Now, before we put her to bed she was fine, only 3 hours had passed since then which probably means her temperature would have continued rising throughout the night had something not made me go in there.

My wife and I can only conclude to this day that the ghost of the old woman that we are pretty sure is in my Gma’s house was the one who got me in there. My grandma’s house is over 110 years old and holds a lot of history. So, to this day we are thankful to this ghost or happening, or whatever you want to call it, and are quite certain that whatever it was, it saved our child’s life.

1363485854.0,96,self.Thetruthishere,1afxsl,"Drifty, The Creepiest Balloon to Ever Exist",cincharge,118,22,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1afxsl/drifty_the_creepiest_balloon_to_ever_exist/,"Hello all! I have long loved this subreddit in (moderate) silence and have decided to sit down and share a little tale of my own.

These events take place in my parents' home (in which I currently reside as I prepare for my next phase of life). We don't live in a historic or very old home or anything like that. The house is part of a plan of homes that was built post-World War II so that the gentlemen coming home would have somewhere to set up shop and start a family in cushy suburbia. Nevertheless, strange (though mostly non-disturbing) things have always happened to us here.

At the time of this incident I was 11 years old, my younger sister Maggie was 6, and we had been living here since she was born. We both attended a Catholic school within walking distance of our house, and being as we had the upcoming Easter weekend off from school, Thursday was the day we both had our class Easter parties. Maggie came home with a large, bright yellow smiley face balloon.

My dad tied it to one of her bedposts for her since she wanted to keep it as long as the helium would allow. Immediately things with that balloon were strange. Maggie and I were home before our parents (latch-key kids!) in those days and she sprinted up to her room to play with the balloon (initially, she was OBSESSED with it).

""Ehhhhh, Cassie! Come and help! My balloon came untied and I can't reach it.""

I went upstairs to her room and the balloon had indeed come undone and was huddling in the highest corner of her ceiling. No biggie. I grabbed a chair to stand on and got it for her. Later when we were about to go to bed, my dad re-tied it to the post.

""Make it really tight, Daddy! It got loose and I couldn't reach it,"" Maggie pouted. So he double knotted it.

The next day when we came home from school - you guessed it - our friend was loose again. ""Daddy didn't do a good job,"" Maggie lamented. However, I was starting to feel weird about this. My dad had double knotted it and the balloon string was straight and smooth.

Over the next day or so the helium was starting to go, so Maggie was content to leave it untied in the corner of her room in the evenings. The day after Easter I awoke fairly early and got out of bed to go to the bathroom. When I opened my bedroom door, I had quite the start as the balloon was there to meet me. It was hovering right outside my doorway right at eye level. I let out a yelp and then laughed, figuring Maggie had left it in the hall and it had drifted my way in its sluggish state. I returned it to her room and went to start my day.

Over the next few days everyone in my family was beginning to notice this balloon and its strange ways. Maggie was fussy because it was never where she left it and Mom and Dad were sharing a some laughs over a few small scares they had when it appeared in a doorway. No one was feeling threatened and Maggie still liked the thing, so were were in no hurry to get rid of it, figuring it only had another few days of helium in it anyway.

That is, until, it began to navigate the stairs. You see, the first four days we had it, it stayed upstairs. On the fifth day, the four of us were in the downstairs living room when the balloon slowly floated across the room we were in and into the next. We had a moment of shared silence and then burst out laughing. We were all severely creeped out, but it was broad daylight and we were all together. However, I did notice that my dad mentioned it being time to get rid of it.

The next day when Maggie and I came home from school, the balloon was ""waiting"" for us in the living room, despite having been left upstairs in her room at the start of the day. I was a little freaked, but Maggie seemed amused and ran upstairs to change. It was then that the balloon ""walked"" by me and slowly floated upstairs after her. I have no idea how, but I distinctly recall the stairs creaking as it moved. I was stunned. Maggie was delighted.

That night I explained what had happened to my Dad and asked if he could please get rid of it (if I did it, it was ""mean""; if Mom and Dad do it, it's ""the rules""). He ran it by Maggie, but she turned on the waterworks about it being her favorite and saying she would keep a better eye on it.

As we arrived home from school the next day, I opened the door with some trepidation. I realllllly didn't want to see the balloon in the living room again. To my relief, it wasn't downstairs. All of the events and fears of the past few days suddenly seemed silly and trivial. It was just a balloon losing its helium. A plaything waiting in my sister's room. 

Except it wasn't.

Maggie was distraught, but I figured my Dad had enough and pitched after we left for the day. I joked that it must've ""run away"" and distracted Maggie with a game in my room. After we had been playing for a few minutes, the footsteps started on the stairs.

""Dad?"" we called. No reply.

After a minute the balloon rounded the corner from the stairs into my bedroom doorway and stopped dead. At that very moment, a poster I had on my wall violently tore in half, part of it remaining on the wall and the other floating listlessly onto my bed. Maggie and I both screamed and I ran to slam my bedroom door. It took forever for someone to come home, but my Dad found us holed up in my room and the balloon innocently swaying in Maggie's. He popped that sucker right quick.

Now, I don't know a whole lot about the behavior of helium and half-deflated balloons, and it's totally possible that the little ""final showdown"" in my room was just some unfortunate coincidences, but to this day Maggie and I go over it (especially when we're drunk) and can't satisfy our minds.

X-post from no sleep.,rosaliezom,119,27,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/19hshi/woman_mysteriously_falls_down_elevator_shaft_she/,"I wasn't sure if this was the place to post this. It is completely true.


I haven't thought about this in months. Half a year ago I moved to San Antonio to stay with my family for awhile. My dad is a mechanic and my step mom is the house keeping manager at The Crockett Hotel. She was able to get me a job as a front desk agent.


After a few weeks of me working there, there was a bit of a ruckus going on over a few days, such as multiple meetings that the general manager was attending. There is always a lot of gossip going around work and I found out from a valet that a house keeper had fallen down the service elevator shaft and died only a few months before. The meetings had to do with the legal crap stemming from the accident. I really didn't think much of it, but it did peak my interest. I knew my step mom obviously had to know her and know more about what happened so I decided to talk to her about it.


She didn't really give me a lot of detail. Basically that Gloria (the housekeeper) had mistakenly walked into an open elevator shaft where the elevator should have been. She fell six stories to her death. My step mom didn't really seem like she was comfortable discussing it but I knew I had to find out more information. I asked my dad if he knew anything about it and he told me Gloria and my step mom were good friends, which explained why my step mom didn't want to talk about it. My dad said he thought Gloria had been a little crazy before she died. He said she used to tell my step mom she witnessed ghosts in The Crockett. My step mom never believed her.


At this point I was beginning to become morbidly curious. I wanted to know the gruesome details. I started asking my coworkers what they knew about Gloria and the ghosts. No one really knew much of anything about that. Awhile passed and I didn't really think about it. I remember one morning I was sitting in the little employee dining area we had in the basement just before work, talking to one of the housekeeping ladies I had recently became friends with. Her name was Yolanda I think. She was a very nice lady, motherly and kind of loud with a thick Mexican accent. I don't remember exactly how we got on the topic but I think I told her something about how it's scary to be in the hotel during the nighttime.


""You should be scared, mija, this hotel is haunted."" She told me. I remember her usual smiling face went serious when she said this. I asked her how and she told me there was lots of people saying they've heard ghosts. She told me Gloria was very convinced she was hearing ghosts.


""I don't like talking about it, it's very sad what happened."" She then pointed out the door of the elevator, not 20 feet beside us, staring me right in the face. ""But everyone knows we're haunted now. She told us that's where the voices come from, in there."" She was no longer smiling, and was visibly shaken. Up until this point I really had no idea and hadn't even thought about where it had happened. The idea of the elevator being somewhere I walked by everyday scared me a lot. It was like a horrible presence, watching and listening. You could easily underestimate how scary an inanimate object such as the closed doors of an elevator can be but I'll never forget the sense of dread I felt when I looked at it.


""No one will use that elevator anymore, mija. Us girls are too scared. It's where she heard a lot of voices. No one believed her but now we do. She got worse toward the end, she was terrified of that elevator but still no one believed her. No one wants to take that elevator and I don't blame them.""


This was very shocking to me. It was the first time I really felt scared to be in the hotel at all. From that point on I avoided the basement as much as possible. I actually found a written statement the front desk manager had made for the lawyers of what had happened that day. I actually made a photocopy of it and read it over when I got home.
If I remember correctly, basically Gloria had been complaining of some elevator problems (noises, jerking movements) days before the accident but they couldn't get the elevator maintenance out to fix it yet. My step mom heard a loud crash that came from the bottom of the service elevator and contacted hotel maintenance to check it out. No one really thought anything of it. They were unable to get the door open for some reason. They decided to wait until they could get the elevator maintenance to come and fix it. Awhile after the crash they realized Gloria was missing and put two and two together. That's when my boss (the front desk manager) instructed the general manager to call 911 because he knew Gloria was at the bottom of the elevator shaft. He went back down to the basement to open the doors. He was somehow able it open and found her bloody mangled body at the bottom of the shaft. He stayed with her dead, broken body until the authorities arrived.


That was basically the end of his statement. I remember the most disturbing part was during the time I was trying to find more information on what happened, a news station had reported that ""Somehow, even as the door was attempting to self close due to the absence of the car, Mrs. Rodriguez entered the opening and fell down the hoistway to her death.""


I still don't understand how it happened. How someone could be waiting for an elevator and just walk into an empty elevator shaft even as the doors closed. Maybe Gloria had a good reason to be afraid of that elevator.

-----------------------------------------------------


This is all completely true. Just google ""death at The Crockett Hotel""
I'm not sure how to prove that I actually worked there. The general manager's name is Bill Brendal, the housekeeping manager's name is Linet Menendez (my step mom), the front desk manager's name is Eduardo Alcantar, the sister hotel is The Meneger and in it is where all employees from the Crockett and The Menger have lunch. The employee lunch room is named ""The Lunch Box"" uhhhmmm... lol Idk what else to say.

But here goes. So, ever since my roommates and I moved into our apartment a few months back we have had quite a few minor experiences. Typically random shadows, noises, random quiet whispers and what sounds like indistinct conversations etc. We're minor skeptics but also think there could be something to some paranormal experiences. Certainly open to the fact that there could be ghosts, spirits, lost souls or whatever you want to call it, in this world. To put it simply we've pretty much accepted the fact that our building or apartment may be a bit ""haunted"". To get to the point, up to now we have had nothing but little things happen and it hasn't been a big deal. However, recently something occurred that was more than a bit strange. Actually pretty freaking creepy. Last Monday my roommate was home by himself and was hanging out and was working on his computer. He has a MacBook and had it hooked up to a dual monitor. He was working on something in Photoshop and had to go to the bathroom at one point. When he leaves everything on his screen is completely fine and there is nothing going on with his computer. He is just sitting there working. While in the bathroom (number two) he is sitting there and he hears some shuffling/movement in his room. Very brief and quiet. He laughs it off because at this point we just scoff and think to ourselves, ""the ghost"" when something like that happens. He comes back to his computer and on his secondary screen there is some weird stuff going on. The screen is bugging out and the windows are all frozen and dragged. In the top left corner is something very weird. He had his phone and quickly took a pretty decent video which I will post post and perhaps we will try and get a nice still close-up of some good parts as well. Take a look for it yourself and let us know what you think. Overall, we are pretty creeped out. What I want out of this, besides opinion, is to see if anyone can try and pin down this image. He and I are avid redditor's so we view a lot of images. He went through all his own images, all the imgur crap we go through and we can seriously not figure out if this was just some weird thing that popped up of an image he had viewed or was somehow viewing. If anyone can find a image mirror or something that would be appreciated. Having piece of mind and knowing it wasn't the ghost fucking with us would be great. Also we live in Downtown Denver in between 16th and 15th on Stout. It's an old ass building but i don't really know the history of it. Although I am quite interested in looking into it know. Anyway, really weird and thought you guys might be able to help or at least enjoy. Here's a still of what most prominently is a girl, and possibly another.

tl;dr potentially some weird ghost shit

EDIT: If there is any interest, some new info came to light last night. I guess some neighbors have had some weird stuff happen too. One in particular came over last night and told us about ""Esther and her daughter"" making this all a bit more strange. This was prior to us showing him the video and was prompted by us simply mentioning a potential ghost when he walked in. r/videos, r/wtf, and r/paranormal don’t seem interested o if there seems to be any more interest here I'm happy to get more details.

EDIT 3: Relevant comments because it's come up a few times:

""Explained elsewhere. I actually mention in the comments that it took place Tuesday, not Monday. The screenshot is dated from yesterday because it was taken when we really started to dive into this last night. We wanted to view the video on his lap top to get a better look and take a nice still shot. The video was originally taken on his phone last week.""

And From commenter kanewaltman (my roommate who took the video): 

""Roommate here, when I edit photos I often use the screenshot tool. Also, I rarely shut down my Mac, it was just an old snapshot of a photo. Trust me though, I scoured my computer for a resembling pic""

From commenter The187Riddler:

""You had me believing it was all a fake as well.So I looked at the video and noticed, the tab with the October date wasn't open, so I checked the date on the open one. now that was really damn hard since it was almost never in focus, but I at least made out the date 11.20.

I am not sure if this would necessarily make any of you readers ""not sleep,"" but it certainly may give some of you the creeps. What I am going to relate to you is the weirdest and creepiest thing I have ever seen. Here goes...

Several years ago (around 1995 or so), I was a student at a university in Houston. One of my best friends from high school (let's call him Rick) was attending a different university in Austin, which is about three hours drive from Houston. On weekends I was not working, I used to often drive out to Austin to hang out with Rick, shoot pool, drink beer, you know: things buddies do whilst in college.

So, one of these weekends was approaching and Rick had recently moved into a new house he was renting with two other roommates. This was in the Hyde Park area of Austin, which is a older neighborhood filled with old houses. These houses are fairly big, Victorian-types, with lots of bedrooms, etc., which is perfect for college-age guys to rent. I was planning on driving up on Friday after my classes were over, so I call Rick on the Thursday before to check in and make sure it was still cool for me to drive out. He tells me that ""yeah...come on out,"" but I hear some kind of hesitation in his voice. I ask him what is wrong, and he says, ""oh...nothing....don't worry about it. C'mon out and we'll hang out.""

Friday comes, I drive out and see this new house he had moved into. Big, white, about four bedrooms, and a fun place to hang out. Large backyard. I notice he is acting kind of weird and I keep pressing him to tell me what is going on, but he continues to assure me that nothing is wrong.

Weekend goes by - pool, drinking, debauchery, you know...college stuff.

Sunday afternoon comes and I'm about to leave to drive back to Houston. I say, ""c'mon, man...cut the sh*t. You've been acting weird all weekend and you gotta tell me what's going on."" Rick replies, ""alright. Yeah, something is wrong. One of my roommates was clearing the flowerbed in the backyard early last week and he found something.""

""Found something?"" I say.

He says, ""yeah...I'll show you.""

He leads me around the side of the house (we had been standing on the front porch) into the backyard. The backyard was large, probably about 30'x30' with a long chain link fence along the back of the yard. The chain link fence separated the back yard from an alley that ran in between the house behind theirs and was where the garbage trucks would pick up trash once a week. Along the chain link fence in Rick's yard was a flowerbed about 3' deep that ran along the length of the fence. If you looked to the left side of the flowerbed, you could see where Rick's roommate had been clearing weeds. The weeds had been cleared out for about 10' of the length of the flowerbed and then abruptly stopped. Lying in the grass there was a shovel and hoe (from the weed clearing) and lying on top of the flowerbed where the weeding had stopped was a couple of fronds from a banana tree they had in the corner of the yard. It looked like the banana fronds were covering something up.

I say, ""so, what's under the leaves?""

Rick says, ""the thing that has been freaking me out all week.""

He leads me through the yard over to the flowerbed. He moves the banana fronds out of the way and there in the dirt, about 6"" deep was a small coffin. The coffin was about 3' long and about 1' to 1.5' wide. It was matte black with a small red cross painted on top. I look at Rick and say, ""dude...what the..."" He replies, ""it gets worse.""

He picks up the shovel laying nearby and uses the handle of it to open the lid of the coffin. The first thing I hear is music box music. It seemed as if opening the lid triggered a music box to begin playing. I don't know where the music box was, I assume concealed somewhere inside of the coffin. I don't recall the tune it was playing. It was creepy.

It gets worse.

The coffin was lined with red velvet. Inside the lid of the coffin were a number of pictures of people I did not know. The pictures were not old (they were in color and looked to be no more than 5-6 years old...also the clothing the people were wearing in the pictures was relatively consistent for early 90s fashion). I notice that the people's EYES had been scratched out as if with a small pen knife or something, where you could see the white of the picture paper through where their eyes had been. There were about 6-8 of these pictures affixed to the lid just like this.

Laying inside of the coffin was the worst part: there was a cat. A dead cat dressed in doll clothes and it appeared to be very dessicated or mummified or something. But wait...it gets weirder. All of the cat's paws had been removed and replaced with heavy gauge brass wire that had been shaped into the shape of claws. These brass claws were jammed into the leg stumps where the cat's original paws had been amputated.

I stood there dumbfounded and Rick says, ""yeah. That's why I've been acting so weird all weekend. Sorry, man."" He closed the lid of the coffin with the handle of the shovel, covered it all back up with the banana fronds and we went back to the front of the house. I drove back to Houston and he moved out of that house within a couple of weeks.

When I reposted it to an askreddit thread 3 months ago this sub was pointed out to me, and I've been meaning to make a post here since.

I formatted this as a story when I first typed it up for /r/NoSleep in an effort to try to follow the rules, then edited it down for the /r/AskReddit thread. I will attempt to further edit it for readability here, but please excuse me if it seems a little odd, as it has now been edited twice. It would just be too painful to type it out from scratch again, honestly that's why I've waited so long to repost this... this story isn't easy for me to tell.

So here goes. I was staying at a friend's apartment for the night, but I was only able to get a ride over a few hours before he got home from work, so I was by myself for the night. It was just about getting dark. Pacing around the damn apartment was getting to me.

No cable, no internet; only a few movies on a dusty shelf, a tv/vcr combo, and a broken cd player in the corner. I plopped on the couch, pulled out my crappy nokia, and opened a new game of snake. The cat heard the beeping and came out of hiding to investigate. Her claws pricked my skin for a second as she jumped onto my chest, leaving small stinging welts... and dammit... my allergies. My nose began to tingle when everything changed.

Surprised, I looked around. My phone was gone, the cat was gone... the couch was there, but different. Instead of the lumpy leather sofa, I was suddenly on a loveseat, a green and yellow plaid. I looked into the kitchen... there was a woman standing there. She watched me, tears in her eyes. She looked to be straight out of a commercial from the early 60's. I almost expected her to ask if I'd like any Ovaltine.
My brain over ridden with shock, I stood up awkwardly, confused and unsure what to do. Suddenly she spoke; ""It wasn't my fault.""
Desperation took hold of her voice.

""It wasn't my fault. You have to believe me!""
I stuttered. ""I... I"".

And then we were in the bathroom. This was all so ludicrous that I barely had time to think how the hell I'd gotten there. Honestly I don't think it even occured to me at the time to wonder. It, too, was the same... but different, newer... and she was kneeling, her back turned to me, singing and laughing over the tub. She was doing something... I stepped forward, and saw. There was a toddler in the tub, a round, pleasant little boy, giggling and splashing, smiling into his mother's face. He had her eyes, but full of happiness instead of the sorrow I saw in hers earlier.

Then the phone rang.

She stood and tweaked his nose, with an ""I'll be right back baby"" and a kiss on the head. She turned and walked through me into the hall.
I watched that smiling, happy baby boy slip beneath the surface.
I screamed in panic and raced forward... and my hands went right through his little body. I flailed desperately to try to save him. I was soaking wet, the water was there, but I couldn't grab him. I watched the life fade from him. Sobbing, I looked up. She stood in the door, watching again.

""It wasn't my fault. Now you see. It wasn't my fault.""

Then the cat was digging its claws into my chest, its fur raised, as it growled at the empty kitchen. I was on the couch, my friend's old leather couch, in the living room again. My phone was on the ground, the game over screen displayed. Disoriented and crying, I pried the cat's claws from my skin.

...and that's when I noticed. I'm still soaking wet. I sat on the couch in shock for a brief moment, VERY confused. There is no way I fell asleep. I wasn't tired at all, I was just sitting there petting the cat and playing a game of snake. After my brain caught up and I realized what had just happened, I grabbed my phone and purse and ran out of that apartment faster than I had ever run. I immediately called my friend and he came and got me, I sat with him at the pizza place he was working at until his shift was over. On one of the lulls in customers I finally calmed down enough to tell him everything.

He instantly believed me, as did the two girls who lived there with him, they'd seen quite a bit while living there, which I'll get to in a moment. A few of my friends, however, were skeptical, so we went to the landlord asking for details. He pulled out an article that referenced a murder/suicide in 1963, where the husband killed his wife after she let their unattended toddler drown in the tub.

**TL;DR: In the most emotionally scarring moment of my life, I watched a toddler that died in 1963 drown and could do nothing.**

Other things happened in that house all the time, but I've lost contact with two of the three friends that lived in that apartment, and sadly the two I've lost contact with are the ones that experienced the most other events. They'd be far better at relaying the details, as I refused to go into their bedroom because of how awful it felt in there. The day I helped them move in I walked into their closet with a box, instantly did a big NOPE and booked the hell out.

What I remember is:

(let's call her) Lisa had the sliding glass door slam and lock shut while she was in the backyard watering the herb garden; this was a regular occurrence and she tried multiple ways of not getting locked out to no avail. (Keep in mind this was a heavy, rusty old door that was very difficult to move, much less close that quickly)

The porcelain dolls her girlfriend collected would regularly face themselves towards the wall while they were sleeping.

One or the other would often wake up in the middle of the night to a large hand rushing towards their throat as if to choke them, only to disappear right when it should grab them.

Heavy objects would throw themselves across the room at someone.
Once, when staying there with Lisa, the unplugged, battery-less stereo in the corner turned itself on to Hells Bells, while the Ozzy cd was sitting on top of the stereo. We freaked out and beat the shit out of it, it stopped after a second.

The cat would stare at one spot and track it's ""movements"" around the room; Lisa, who was losing her eyesight, claimed she occasionally saw balls of light where the cat was staring.

Both Lisa and her girlfriend would wake up in the middle of the night unable to breathe, like someone was sitting on their chest.

Let me start by saying I just found this subreddit and frankly, I'm not sure if its just stories or truth or a mixture of both. However, this one is all truth. I'm sure everyone says that, but I'm sincere. That said, here goes.
I know all the classic stories are of old houses in rural areas, houses that 'sigh' or creak or whatever - but that was not the house we moved into. Our family moved into a suburban home in a suburban city (its near San Diego) that had been built maybe eight years before we moved in. The prior residents had been renters - I honestly know nothing about them except that they kept sending their mail to our house and one girl would occasionally show up to collect it, for a good year or two after we moved in. Who knows.

Regardless, the real story is that since the day we moved in, there was something off about the house. It started so small, and honestly I took the very lightest hit of all the weird stuff my sister and I put up with. One thing that really struck me is that one time I was upstairs, and walked into my sister's room across the hall from mine. The way it was set up was that you walked up the stairs from the front 'formal' living room and dining room and found a bathroom straight ahead, my parents' and sister's room on the left, and my room on the right. So in this scenario, I walked by the open bathroom door on my right into my sister's room. When I walked back 30 seconds later to my own room, the sink faucet was on. Neither of us could make head or tails of it. And I know - you're thinking, oh big whoop, every horror movie ever. But it wasn't a horror movie, it was some suburban home with a community pool across the street and two parents downstairs in broad daylight. It was real, it was normal, and it didn't make a lick of sense. This became normal.

I have never before and never since lived in a house that made more noise. Literally every night, there were creaks and thuds in the attic. I never slept with my door open - there's a good reason, ask my sister - and I had to have music on at a very low volume every night to be able to cover the eerie noises. The attic was above my room, but it was only accessible via a tiny square opening in the ceiling of my parents' walk-in closet, which required a ladder to climb up to. The sounds had no pattern, for the most part. I would count the seconds between clicks and thumps - always different. They would start at random times and disappear in the morning. One time it was the approximate sound of someone running loudly upstairs. Again, it made no sense. I slept in multiple friends' houses in the same neighborhood and never heard those sounds - noises you would expect in a haunted 100-year-old house.

I used to see things out of the corner of my eye - one time I swear to a God I don't really believe in I saw a boy in the kitchen doorway...it was New Years Eve and I was alone - needless to say I drove across town to my parents. Frames and clocks would slam face-down while I was home alone and even while one friend I confided in was over after school once. She was stunned and believes everything I've told her since.

As for my parents, they thought my sister and I were full of it. My mom is still adamant about it being all our imagination, and my dad was with her for years until one night he came upstairs. It was my junior year of high school and I was exhausted after swim practice doing homework on my bed, semi-asleep. He walked into my room and asked me, ""Are you alright?"" I looked up, said, ""Yeah, tired, but ok."" It was a stressful time for me and he seemed concerned, more than usual. ""You weren't just crying?"" he asked, and I said no, confused. ""You're sure?"" he repeated, and again I said I hadn't been crying, he could look at my eyes to check. He shook his head, walked to my sisters room and asked her as well, emphatic in his questioning. Finally he walked back and said, looking utterly confused, ""I just heard a girl in the front living room crying for a while."" I looked at him with zero surprise and repeated it hadn't been me. He looked infinitely confused and worried, and asked me if I was sure once more before finally going back downstairs to his TV. I hadn't heard a single thing with my door wide open...and he believed us after that.

Also, one morning I was getting dressed before my zero period and the only person who was ever up that early (I woke up at 4:30 to shower) was my mom, who wore a blue satin bathrobe while getting dressed. I was standing at my dresser in front of my mirror, right next to the open door, and distinctly saw a tail of blue fabric go around the corner of the upstairs hallway towards our office, to the left of my doorway. That's where my mom ironed, so I figured she must have just forgotten to iron the night before and thought nothing of it - until the garage door downstairs jangled open and I heard her walk into the kitchen literally five seconds later. I walked down the hall and saw no one and nothing unusual, and nothing blue. My sister saw the blue (we think it was a dress) around a corner once too.

Honestly though, my stories are paltry compared to what my sister experienced. She was the reason I couldn't sleep with my door open after she ran into my room in the middle of the night shaking with terror and refused to tell me why. A year later she told me, and I never slept with the door open to the hallway again. If you guys believe any of this, I'll get to the real meat on the bone, just ask. But if not, let this fade away into the depths of reddit and tell yourself I'm making this up.

I'm not. And that's why you all should be scared.

Edit: My sister's experience! http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/10b4fw/fam_our_legitimately_haunted_house_cont/

Edit 2: I forgot to mention the weirdest thing I personally saw happen (sort of, its a tough contest haha). One night I was sitting on my bed petting my cat and he was staring intently over at my closet, which always kind of creeped me out because one time a random backpack I hadn't touched in four years that was on top of one of the storage shelves fell down to the bottom of the closet for no reason at about 3 am and woke me up. Anyway, my closet was right behind my desk, as it was a small room, and I had this rickety antique-looking roll-y desk chair. I had draped a long necklace over one of the dowels/posts(?) coming out of the top of the chair back, a necklace made of bronze beads that kind of look like pearls but are brown - its a really solid, heavy necklace. 

While following my cat's gaze, I happened to look at the necklace right as it was seemingly yanked downwards a few inches by an invisible hand - the beads scratched hard on the wood with an audible noise and it swung back and forth from the force then came to a halt just as if I had done it. I was across the room, no windows were open, no drafts or anything and the beads were heavy enough that to act that way it would indisputably have required a force pulling on it from one side, like a little kid messing around or something. Me and the cat just ogled it for a few more minutes as it swung to a halt again, but there was absolutely no denial nor explanation to justify that seemingly simple, plain as day motion that defied every aspect of whatever reality or natural laws we have in this world. It's funny how something so simple completely blows your logic of the world away - even as an atheist I can't deny anything supernatural or who knows what after literally witnessing defiance of the laws of physics or reality in front of my face.

[ME]",polkadotgirl,110,22,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18xqqu/skinwalkersi_originally_posted_this_on_rnosleep/,"I just copied and pasted from my original post. I didn't know r/nosleep had mostly fake stories. This is real. 

I never have until I moved out to New Mexico. New Mexico is a darkly beautiful place; it has an emptiness and fullness that somehow coexist.
Now to my story. I started dating a Navajo boy from a pretty traditional Navajo family a few years ago. (I am white, if that matters to anybody). They lived on the Navajo reservation, and for those of you who aren't familiar with it, it is a giant, beautiful, and at most times, empty space. You can drive for miles and often see nothing.

His family lived in a trailer attached to a traditional hoghan. I basically ended up moving in with his family for a while, and at first, I was not used to being able to see every star at night because of the lack of light pollution. I wasn't used to the stillness of the area. However, I eventually loved the quietness and peacefulness that I never had experienced growing up in bigger towns.

Again, my boyfriend's family was pretty traditional. A few weeks after he graduated, he started getting into some trouble. We went to a medicine man, and please know that I did not believe in any of this stuff. I went along with it because it was an interesting experience and I was respectful of his family's views.

The medicine man said that my boyfriend was following a dark path. He had recently started drinking, but being young and naive, and I really didn't care what this medicine man had to say. He gave my boyfriend many warnings and gave a blessing to the family.

Now, it was kind of true though. My boyfriend was starting to follow a dark path, but I did not know eventually how dark it would get. It really feels like his dark path began with this experience. Now, I am normally a very logical, rational person, but up until this day, I cannot explain this event. When I tell people that don't come from this area, they usually think I'm crazy.

So, one night I fell asleep with my boyfriend on his bed. It wasn't quite dark yet. In fact, the sun was setting and I could feel a cool breeze come from the open window. The blinds were partially open, and I was slowly falling asleep. At this point, I was somewhere between asleep and awake, and my boyfriend was fully asleep.

Suddenly, I heard a man speaking in harsh Navajo right outside the window. I woke up and started shaking my boyfriend. Then, I heard the loudest animal-like scream. It sounded as though somebody had kicked a dog. We ran down stairs to the trailer, and as were running, his mom was running inside! Without us saying anything she told us her story!
""I was outside, grooming the dogs. All of a sudden, the dogs started acting strange, almost submissive. She looked over to where our bedroom window was and said she saw a tall (about 7 feet) dark man standing right outside our window. As soon as he noticed her, he grew angry, and took off. She said he was so fast it was almost as if he disappeared before her eyes.

There are not many places he could have gone. Again, this area is wide and easy to see everything. There was nobody home except us. The story is not over.

So, we kept trying to explain away what happened, but it was just too weird. Even if it were just a man, how was he so fast? Who was he? Where could he have possibly gone. Then, I really started to wonder...could it be a skinwalker?

Skinwalkers, according to the tradition I was told, originally came about because the Navajo were (in the past) travelers and raiders. They would go to other villages and steal food and other items to survive. Now in order to be faster, some developed the ability to steal the skins of animals and utilize their powers. Some, however, started to use this power for evil.

Of course, this is just one tradition. I was still scared, but decided I had to go home. Although I lived with my boyfriend, I often stayed at my parents house on certain nights. Now, he lived on off a long, dark, and creepy road. I didn't want to go alone. So, this time I asked him to come along and have his mom follow me out.

Well, as we were driving, I saw the creepiest creature I have ever seen in the distance. We slowed down. It looked like a coyote, yet it was so bony, and almost had human like features. We didn't want to hit whatever it was as it crossed the street in front of our. We had to stop. As it was crossing it was just staring at us, in the most evil, vile manner. It honestly looked demonic, and in a strange way, cartoon-like. Coyotes normally run, but this one was walking slowly -- almost crawling. As soon as it passed, his mom drove in front of us ""to break its path."" Many Navajo people believe that if a coyote (or whatever the hell this creature was) crosses your path, it is a bad sign. We drove out and I was terrified. I didn't look back. I don't believe any of us did.

Strangely, my life, and my boyfriend's life really went downhill from that point on. Many other odd experiences happened that I will post stories about if anybody is interested.

I'm sorry if this was jumpy or anything, but I decided to write this at the worst possible time.

1343713231.0,88,self.Thetruthishere,xfox1,xPost from r/Paranormal My mother received a voicemail from my grandmothers landline phone and it is pretty disturbing.,midwayer,104,16,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/xfox1/xpost_from_rparanormal_my_mother_received_a/,"Hello r/Paranormal, I would like some help with this voicemail my mother received this morning at around 11:30am. Here is some background information: My grandmother lives alone in an old house that my mother and her two sisters grew up in. When they were children the house was supposedly haunted by spirits. My mother was haunted by a voice that would call her name ""Judy"" from the bathroom, her sister Gina would speak in tongues at times. It got to the point where they had a priest come in and cleanse the house. Other than a few odd occurrences there was nothing too major, and it happened so long ago that it doesn't concern my family anymore. (sorry trying to keep this short)
So today my mother calls me and asks if I pranked her by leaving her a creepy voicemail. I explain to her that I didn't, and ask who was the last person to call her. She had two missed calls from my grandmother before the message, and when I finally made it to my mothers house to listen to the message I found that it did indeed come from my grandmothers house. We called my grandmother and she told us that she did not leave any message, and my mother even went over her house durning the day to ask her about the message and she was told that there was no way she left a message on her phone. The message is not static but seems more glitchy, but there is a dominant low voice that seems to say my mothers name slowly ""Juuuuddyyy"" at times. its 50 seconds long and repeats. I brought my friends over because they love the supernatural so we came over to see what we could investigate, and to help my mother put because she is extremely religious and emotional. I figured out how to send the message to my own phone and then uploaded it to my computer where I have some software that can enhance the sound clips. Every time I listen to it I get shivered down my back, and I wanted to see what anyone else thinks of this. I have uploaded the original voicemail to an mp4 on mediafire. I am not sure if there is an easier way to share this, if there is please let me know but the link to download the file is here:

The clip is 50 seconds long, and it is a bit disturbing to me at least.

Now before I get into this, it's worth stating that I have always considered myself a staunch non-believer in things like ghosts or spirits and the like.  I have always had a casual interest in the paranormal, but purely for entertainment, and never considered such phenomena anything other than fiction or delusion.  I wont jump to conclude that a ""ghost"" or some nonphysical entity is responsible for what I experienced, but truthfully I just don't have a satisfactory explanation. 

This happened a little over a year ago.  I work in supported living.  My job is to work one-on-one with mentally disabled adults, and to assist them with anything they don't have the skills to do for themselves, while ensuring their safety in their homes.  I regularly work long overnight shifts of 18 hours or more, and I sleep on the couch at the client's (yeah its weird but that's what we are supposed to call them) home after they are asleep.  The man who's home I was at on this particular night is a 54 year old man with Downs Syndrome as well as a severe speech impediment.  He can only speak a small hand full of words, and even those come out stuttered and difficult to understand.  He communicates by using a repertoire of hand signals that he has come up with over the years and by occasionally writing/drawing crudely on paper.  He is a very sweet and affectionate man, but is pretty severely disabled cognitively.  He lives in a very old family home that he grew up in with his parents and siblings.  He has lived there for his whole life.  He was extremely close with his mother who died about 8 years ago after caring for him in their home for the duration of her time on earth.  His father died a few years before that.  He (my client) took her death very hard, and still occasionally has crying spells when he thinks of her and remembers she is gone.  He keeps a tattered photograph of her near him when he is home, and continually moves it around the house, showing it to me and referring to it frequently.  

The living room of the house has a huge black wood-burning stove for heating the house, complete with a chimney.  It is never used.  A few feet to the left of this stove is a spot that was the focal point for some weirdness.  With some regularity, the dogs in the house would stop, stare at the spot, and growl at it menacingly.  Sometimes they would even run in from the kitchen barking like crazy, stop and growl at the spot for a bit before returning to normal.  Several times I saw the cat walking across the living room freeze in mid stride and stare at the same spot, rigid and alert, frozen for several minutes as if it was afraid of being seen.  Sometimes I would wake up late at night and see the cat sitting opposite me, awake and staring vigilantly at the same spot.
On this particular night around 9:00 I was sitting on the couch in the living room when BOTH dogs came tearing into the room barking like crazy, ran over to the spot by the stove, stopped short and froze for a split second, then emitted a squeal like they had been kicked.  They turned 180 and tore back out the room crying and whimpering in terror.  They ran all the way through the house and out the back door.  Weird, but I really wasn't perturbed and just wrote it off as dogs being stupid.  A little later my client came out of his room, looked at me, then pointed to the spot in question and gave me the hand signal for ""monster"" or ""ghost.""  He kept looking between me and the spot and speaking unintelligible syllables while I struggled to understand him.  Then he looked at me and did something I have never seen him do before or since.  He  took one finger and held it pointed at his throat and slowly dragged it from one side to the other before returning to his room.  I thought it was pretty weird, but I shook it off and went to sleep a bit later.  The couch that I sleep on is against the wall with the stove in the corner, meaning when I am lying on it, the stove is behind the arm of the couch my head lays on.  The spot is immediately to the left of the stove, which is uncomfortably close.  I woke up in the middle of the night to some scraping sounds coming from the stove.  It was the sound of metal on metal and sounded just like a person using the hook thing to move the logs around and stoke the fire.  I thought this was odd and sat up fully awake, then I heard a thump on the front door and heard it jiggle in the frame.  Thinking it was the cat wanting to be let in or something I walked over to the door (which is part glass do you can see outside) and stared out into the darkness confused.  There was nothing there.  That's when it happened.  There was a loud, I would say whisper but really more of a hiss, like someone speaking as forcefully as they could without breaking a whisper.  It sounded like it was inches from my ear and I swear to god I felt the air hitting my ear.  It said, unmistakably and clearly enunciated ""WATCHING YOU."" I responded reflexively to feeling of air hitting my ear and my whole body jerked violently before the understanding of what I had heard followed and I froze.    I looked around... Nothing.  I even peeked into his room to see of he had somehow learned to speak and had said it from behind the door, but he was fast asleep.  I laid back down, turned on the tv and just lay there rigid and awake, trying to calm my shit down until I eventually fell asleep.

Like I said, I have never been a believer in the paranormal. Even though I am quite sane and have never experienced hallucinations of any kind, I told myself I must have had some temporary lapse in perception, that it MUST have just been in my mind.  I never spoke to anyone about it and I tried not to think about it in the year since this happened, and just put it out of my mind until today.   I was chatting with a coworker who works in the same home.  We got on the topic of the client's habit of carrying on conversations when nobody is in the room with him.  He sometimes speaks to empty chairs as if there is someone sitting in them, and has full on conversations with breaks where he appears to be listening to a response, but his speech is unintelligible to us.  She said ""he's probably talking to his mom"" to which I responded jokingly ""do you think she haunts the house?""

She then admitted that she too had heard things in the house.  Whispers.  She described it exactly like what I had heard, down to feeling the breath on her ear.  

I am writing this here in the house.  I can hear him in his room right now, chattering away, pausing periodically as though someone is responding.  I will be sleeping here on the couch tonight.

The building was old so at first I didn't think too much of lights turning on and off, or ceiling fans whirring around then suddenly stopping.

Toys would go missing, books would get ripped up and I just figured it was the kids (these were three year olds by the way) When I'd ask them about it they'd usually just say ""The ghost did it"" Ok kid, nice try.

A little boy starts crying, curled up in the corner of the room. They'd go, ""The ghost is making him sad"" That's...kind of a weird thing to say.

One day I swear I felt someone come up behind me, grab my shoulders, and blow a big puff of air one the back of my neck. I screamed and turned around seriously expecting to see a person standing there and there was just...nothing. The kids asked me what was wrong. I was so stunned all I could say was ""I think it was the ghost.""

I finally talked to some co-workers including the director about what was happening. Turns out about 20 years ago a woman who'd worked there killed herself in the woods behind the center. She had worked in the classroom I was in now.

One night I went out to dinner with a co worker, I left my car at the center and we both rode in hers. When she brought me back to pick it up, it was almost midnight. From outside we could see the window to my class had light coming from it. But it was weird, not like the light had been left on, it was more of just a glow with lots of flickering and shadows. We looked at each other like ""Please tell me you're seeing this too"".
And when we looked back there was a woman standing in the window.

When my brother D was around 5-6 he would spend hours in his room talking to two imaginary friends, named Alma and Waka (he pronounced it wake-a). He spoke to them most days for about 6 months. 
One day my mum found him in his room crying. She asked what was wrong. He said ""Alma and Waka don't want to play with me anymore. They went up there (pointing to the attic in his room).

About 10 years later my youngest brother C, who has autism came downstairs from bed around mid-night. He was crying but not making any noise. He came and just sat in the sofa.
My mum asked what was wrong.
""Waka's dead. He's got blood in his head!""

He didn't know anything about D's imaginary friends. We had never spoke about it. With him having autism he never lies which makes it even creepier. 

We've had more experiences in our house, which was owned by a priest before us. 
Sorry for the wall of text. This story is completely true.

UPDATE!

I've been searching all day for what the names could mean.
Alma is Spanish meaning 'soul' , Waker means 'he who wakes'.
If anyone knows anything to help it would be greatly appreciated.
I live in Chesterfield UK BTW.

UPDATE 2!

Just been talking to my brother and he made a really good point.
My mum went through a phase of playing with a home made Ouiga Board.
I thought she was full of shit, but tbh everyone in our house is spiralling down.
My mum drinks a lot, I do too, my brother is depressed and so is my dad.

I left a part out that may be important.  I realized after reading misterfk's response that I may actually have done something to unsettle the house.  

Here's the thing: my family, especially my mother, were devout Hindus.  We celebrated all of the Holy festivals, and ""sacrificed"" food to our idols daily, with large feasts for them several times a year.  These idols had been in the family for generations, and had been given sacrifices for decades.  

When my father left, I was a really conflicted 14 year old.  Previous to that I had been very faithful to my religion, and I had gone with my family to temple one to two times a month, and really prayed with faith.  I believed in it and whatnot.  I lost my faith when my father left, and converted to Christianity soon afterwards (I've since lost my faith in recent years after becoming a scientist). Well, I began seeing the room full of idols, which was coincidentally also the room in which I saw the ""shadow"" years earlier, as a hypocrisy against my new faith.  With my mothers permission, (she also converted), and help of a family friend, who was also a Pastor,  I cleared the room out and threw out EVERYTHING.  Straight in the garbage. 

My mother's faith in Christianity increased exponentially after that day, and I didn't find out why until after my baptism a year later.  She always spoke of me clearing the idols out with a sense of pride, but I found out later why. The first night after the incident she woke in the middle of the night with several pairs of red eyes staring at her from the hallway.  She began praying furiously, and they disappeared, and she never saw them again.  She interpreted it as the spirits of the idols leaving the house or something.

Anyway, I didn't add that part because it was in the middle of the night, and though my mother speaks of the instance with conviction, I've always thought it could've been a dream or something.  IDK, my mother's not one to lie, but it could've been a dream that she earnestly believed happened.  

The instances where my mother saw the goat thing, and my uncle saw the woman, hair pulling etc. occurred after this.

I dunno if this could have had any part to play in the whole situation, but maybe I upset a spiritual balance or something.

~~-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

ORIGINAL STORY:

Throwaway, because there's a lot of personal stuff here.

I'm writing this mainly to get it off my chest, but also because I really would like some honest insights into what may have happened to us.

I'll start at the beginning.

**BACKGROUND** (it's kinda long so scroll down if you wanna get to the creepy bits)

My parents bought the house from the bank after it had been foreclosed.  It was a massive three story home that at one point had been a boarding house, but was converted into a single family home. it had vaulted (13 foot) ceilings, and was really spacious but it fell into disrepair.  My parents bought it, hired a contractor and refinished most of the inside. 

So my family was really happy before this. We very rarely fought, and we all got along really well.  My parents at this point had been married 23 years, and my sister was 20 (10 year gap), and was commuting to college in the city.  Being immigrants, both my parents worked A LOT, and had long commutes.  They were usually gone from 5 AM to 7-9 PM, sometimes later. Throught out 5th grade-6th grade, it was just my sister and me the entire evening.  My sister got married and moved out when i was in the 6th grade, so after that it was just me.

So enough background.  Here's the weird shit.

**THE STORY** (or several stories)

Shortly after moving into this house, my entire family started fighting a lot about the stupidest things, it was like everyone was crazy tense all the time.  Me and my sister started destroying each other, which is weird because we rarely ever fought.  My dad became really distant.  He became apathetic and irresponsible, and my mother became incredibly high strung and stressed out.  Screaming matches between all four of us became an every day thing.

This was also when I started getting really terrible headaches, every single day.  We had amazing insurance from my moms job, so I must've seen a new doctor almost every couple weeks for over a year, and had half a dozen brain scans without results.

I soon became terrified of the house.  I could never sleep in my own room. Never.  I'd be woken up every single night by what I could only describe as pure terror.  I would suddenly wake up feeling like something or someone was hovering over me, even with all the lights on.  This dread carried into my evenings alone.  I was terrified of leaving my living room/dining room area, adjacent to the kitchen.

The thing is I never actually saw anything until one occasion. This was about a year after we moved in. I was walking home from school, and as I approached my house I saw something in the second floor window that froze my blood.  The middle of the vertical blinds in my parents walk in closet window was being held open at a 45 deg angle.  All I could see was pitch black (odd since it was ~2:45 pm and sunny). I stopped in my tracks and felt like a rabbit being stared down by a wolf, ice in my veins, hairs on end etc.  A second later the blinds  fell into place, swinging side to side as if someone holding them had let go.  Everyone had always avoided this room because it really did ""feel"" creepy.  It was always really cold, even in warm weather, to the point where my dad had to insulate the door because it would suck the heat out of the master bedroom.  This was especially strange because it was a tiny room with a full wall length hot water radiator.

Many people who have stayed at my house have commented that whenever they would leave the first floor, it felt like they were being ""watched"".   We all felt it.  Some of our family friends flat out hated staying over because of the creepiness. My dad was probably the only one who never admitted it.

So my parents ended up splitting up.  My dad walked out on us, and me and my mom stayed in that house alone for a while (14 years old at this point).  Until one day when my mother suddenly moved us out into a shitty apartment for apparently no reason.  I didn't find out why until I was 21 years old.  It was also around this time when I started having my ""panic attacks"".  They were always when I was sleeping, and I would wake up towards the end in strange places feeling panic like none other, and really confused.  I was told afterwards that I would do really horrible things while I was having this ""sleep walking panic attacks"".  Once I jumped on a table and tried to stick myself in the (moving) ceiling fan.  Another time my mother found me wailing on the floor of the kitchen surrounded by cutlery. My mom finally told me recently what she saw that made her to gtfo of that house so suddenly. She was woken up one night by a sound, as me and her were sleeping on the floor of the living room.  She looked up in the dark to see what looked like a naked man, with the head and feet of a goat standing in the hall doorway.  It said something along the lines of ""I will have your husband, I will have your husband, He's mine. This house is mine.""  We moved out the following weekend.

About 6 months later, I moved in with my sister and her husband in Colorado (from NYC).  My dad moved back into that house.  As soon as I left, I lost the ""panic attacks"", the constant headaches, and all the fear that plagued me for 4 years.  It was an immediate change.  I grew 8"" in a year, and put on 25 lbs.  I looked and felt great, it was a new me. 

I never returned to that house until a year ago, in my last year of college.  My mother decided to take the house back from my father, along with the help of her two sisters and one of their husbands (Ill call them B, C, U respectively).  I told her not to do it, but she refused to listen and moved in anyway.

I left the country for 4 months on study abroad at that point. When I came back, I found out that my mother had moved back to her apartment in Brooklyn.  After a lot of pestering she told me this story:

They all (B,C,U and mom) were staying in the house together for two weeks to get my mom acclimated.  They began hearing thumping noises upstairs, footsteps throughout the house.  One day, my aunt C had to use the bathroom, but was too afraid to walk there alone so she woke up her husband U.  They go to the bathroom, while U waits outside. He turns to the kitchen, adjacent, and suddenly sees a naked women, with no face sitting at the dining table.  He silently closes the door and doesnt mention it to anyone until the next day. 

My mom decides to call a missionary friend over in order to pray over the house.  While they are doing the prayers loudly in a circle, they hear furious thumping coming from upstairs. Suddenly the front door flies open. 

I believe the final straw was when my mother was alone on the third floor.  She suddenly felt as if someone grabbed her braided hair and yanked it backwards.  She was alone in the house.

**THE HOUSE'S HISTORY**

The last part I need to add is the history of the house.  My mother had a conversation with the neighbor shortly after my dad left that freaks me out to this day.  My neighbor was in his late 80's at the time, and had lived next to my house since he was in his 20s.  He told my mother straight out that there was something wrong with my house.  No family that had ever moved in thrived while living there.  The owners before the last owners of the house were a family with twins.  The two twins died in a car accident, after which the husband left the wife, and she committed suicide in the house.  The family directly after lived OK until the kids left.  The couple soon began fighting a lot, and then the husband died of a heart attack.  The wife became a shut in, and started going insane, screaming in the night.  She would leave all the doors and windows of the house wide open at all times even in the middle of winter, and the neighbors would have to go close them whenever they could.  The city finally stepped in and committed her to a mental hospital.  The bank took the house and sold it to us.

Tell me what you think.

I would have been about 12 or 13 and listening back to the tapped radio.  I was wide awake and doing some homework when River of Dreams came on.  Halfway though the track, the song stopped and this voice came on.  The voice was deep and croaky. I can't remember what it said now, but I remember the icey feeling it gave me and remember jumping over to the tape deck and hitting the stop button.  

Once I calmed down, I rewound the tape a bit and played the song again - thinking it might have been the DJ messing around.  The song played through with no spooky voice.  So I did it again and again with no difference.

Enjoy.

My creepiest and scariest ghost story for me happened about a year ago. It really was more of a posession than a ghost story. I was helping another nurse with a patient that had lived a very hard life. It had numerous things going on with him from cardiac to renal failure. You name it, he had it going on. This man was very much afraid to die. 

Every time his heart monitor beeped, he would just go into a rage screaming, ""Don't let me die! Don't let me die!"" The other nurse and I found out why he didn't want to die. About 0200 his cardiac monitor starts alarming V-Tach. We both rush into the room. I am pulling the crash cart behing me. When I get to the room, the other nurse is completely white. This man was sitting about 2 inches above the bed and was laughing. His whole look completely changed. His eyes just had a look of pure evil on them and he had this evil smile on his face. He laughed at us and said, "" You stupid b****es aren't going to let me die will you?"" and he laughed again. We were kinda frozen. I did reach up and hit the Code Blue button and when I did the man went into V-fib. He crashed back onto the bed. We started coding him, but after 20 minutes it was called. 5 minutes after the code was called several of the code team is in the room cleaning up when this man sits straight up in the bed and says, "" You let him die. Too bad."" and then begins laughing. The man collapsed back to the bed. 


We heard a horrible, agonizing scream ( actually every patient in the unit that night commented on the scream), and then you could hear ""don't let me die"" being whispered throughout the unit. Everyone of the nurses that night was pale and scared. No body went anywhere by themselves. By morning the whispers of ""don't let me die"" were gone. The night shift nurses had a prayer service in the break room before we left for home and then we all had nightmares for weeks.

At the time, I had a physically exhausting job, and would crash out at about 8pm, which meant I was waking up before 4am.

I would go out on the deck with my coffee, watching the raccoons do their thing. From 4 to 6 am, I had the street to myself.

Until one morning. I'd been there a year at this point. At 4:15, a car parked three houses away started up. Different, but whatever, somebody's got an early flight. I waited for the sound of a door, for someone to come out of a house with their luggage. Never happened.

Instead, four people, men in dark clothes, suddenly converged on the car from four different directions. I have no idea where they came from. Nobody came out of a house, nobody walked down the street. They seemed to come out of the dark places between streetlights. They didn't speak. When they got to the car, all of them at the exact same moment, they opened the doors *in unison*, got in and then closed the doors *in unison*. One sound when the doors opened, and one sound when they closed.

The car drove away. I lived there two more years, and never saw this again. 

Now, I can imagine a group of people carpooling together long enough might achieve this choreography. But it only happened once.

They're, so far, my only instances. Enjoy!

So, a little while ago, I posted a story about growing up in a haunted house. Unfortunately I'm unable by use of phone, to post the link. However it's of course accessible in my profile. 

After we moved out of the house, due to it's increasingly disturbing paranormal activity, we moved into a quaint little house that my parents still reside in. We had a small amount of activity while we were renovating but it quickly subsided. Perhaps it was some left over haunted residue. 

I had two incidents, regarding my sisters, Mary and Sarah. 

The first was with Sarah. I was about 12, making her 14. It was her and I home alone, and we were about to paint our bedrooms. She headed upstairs, and I gathered the last few supplies from the kitchen, and use the bathroom. When I passed by, I saw her sitting in the living room, on the sofa. I asked her something in passing, but I do not recall what. She avoided eye contact, staring at the wall. Nearly stoic. I said her name, once, twice. Still she stared forward. I felt unnerved and went upstairs. When I reached her bedroom, I saw Sarah, opening paint cans and humming along with music. I explained the situation and we both thoroughly searched the house for the,""other,"" which goes without saying was fruitless. 

The incident with Mary is similar. We were making dinner together in the kitchen, a few years later. She suggested I go upstairs to get a CD to listen to. I went upstairs to get one from my bedroom, and upon return, passed her bedroom. For no reason, I felt a moment of pause outside her door. It was pulled shut, and I felt uneasy. I pushed it open quietly and saw Mary standing in the dark, facing her windows. The wall had two long windows on it, with vertical blinds. The blinds were pulled to the side, with Mary in front. She had her hands up, as if to press against the glass, but they were not touching it. I asked if she was alright, and feeling like my voice came out shakey. She did not respond verbally as I expected. She did, however, begin to rapidly walk backwards towards me. A few feet from the staircase, I bolted, and did not wait until she reached me. I found Mary in the kitchen, happily making dinner. I decided against telling Mary about this.

1359931926.0,79,self.Thetruthishere,17txvg,[FR] My basketball coach works as a janitor late at night at my school and he cleans the haunted elementary part,superkrispie,94,15,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/17txvg/fr_my_basketball_coach_works_as_a_janitor_late_at/,"He's new to our school this year and he works as a basketball coach and a janitor. He works the night shifts when other people aren't there. A couple weeks ago he told me and another girl that when he was cleaning, he was singing really loud and he heard a little kid's voice say, ""Why do you like to sing so much."" and then when he turned around to see what was talking to him no one was there. It was at 11 PM at night and he was the only one signed in to work. He said it was like a little kid's voice, but it had a high pitch so he couldn't tell if it was a girl or a boy.

Now some backstory. We just got a new remodel of our school, and the elementary part was built in 1880. The old campus had 4 separate buildings, but now they're all connected with a ton of hallways.
Supposedly, a long time ago, there was a little boy who fell off a stairwell and broke his neck and died instantly. People think that the ghost of that boy haunts the school. Now that all the schools are connected, our coach thinks that the ghost has moved into the newer elementary and preschool part of the school.

* He said he randomly gets chills when cleaning in that part of the school. 
* He said he was cleaning a mirror and he saw someone behind him in the reflection, but when he turned around there was no one there. 
* Other janitors have seen writing on chalkboards but with backwards ""E's"". I can't remember what the writing was though. 
* He said that when he's cleaning he sees a red thing darting by the reflections in the window but when he turns around he can't see anything. 

He doesn't know what to think. He's freaked out by it, but he says that he also feels bad that this little kid ghost is stuck here. One of his friends told him that he's not supposed to talk to it because then it will get attached to him. He just wants to know more about it but he doesn't know what to do.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_17txvg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/17txvg/fr_my_basketball_coach_works_as_a_janitor_late_at/,
1375334034.0,79,self.Thetruthishere,1jh4my,Astral Projected into Somebody's Purgatory,Colcabamba,99,20,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1jh4my/astral_projected_into_somebodys_purgatory/,"Hi there, I am a 26 year old who, for the past year, has been developing and honing my AP skills. It all started in late high school/early college when I would accidentally astral project, and, not knowing what the hell was occurring, would panic and then mistake it for another hyper realistic dream/nightmare. I decided to read more on lucid dreaming, soon realized the distinct differences between dreaming and astral projecting, and then began to read all sorts of literature regarding APing. The following occurrence took place over Christmas Eve.

I am a Roman Catholic, and my faith has always played a large role in my life. That said, I am very open minded when it comes to spirituality and I know that many things simply aren't as cut and dry as any institutionalized religion generally tries to make them seem.

When I was 8 years old, my favorite uncle was murdered in Peru. My family emigrated from there in the 80's but we’d visit this uncle every summer and stay in his house. My memories of him are full of affection and love; he was a brilliant chemist with a mischievous sense of humor and a good heart. 

He was murdered in his home one night and I'll never forget the phone call our house received at 2 in the morning and hearing my mother (my uncle's sister) screaming. Everything changed after that, and our trips to Peru soon became more infrequent. My parents worked hard to keep me and my siblings from learning more about the details of his murder (and especially the name of his killer, a man he knew), but over the years we slowly pieced it together.

My uncle's killer was a poor man who would constantly ask my uncle for money, and being the selfless man that he was, my uncle would always help him out in some way or another. Later on my uncle developed some very interesting formulas regarding rubber (I wish I could write more about this, but I'm pretty scientifically ignorant), and he began a correspondence with a company here in the US that was interested in making a business deal. He soon made plans to come to the US on a business trip, but two nights before his departure, he woke up to the sound of a man breaking into his home. I won't go too much into details because it is a very sensitive subject, but it was the indeed the man who’d always badger him for money, and my uncle ended up being stabbed to death.

In the end this man somehow only served two years in prison, and my family, heartbroken, refuses to talk about the horrible subject to this day.

Being 8 years old, it was hard for me to try to comprehend everything that was going on at the time, but later on, when I was older and I fully understood what happened, I became resentful of this mystery man, this symbol of depravity and murder that so hurt and damaged my family.

Over the years I eventually began to think of him less and less, and by the time I was in college, I had accepted my uncle's murder and had come to peace with the whole ordeal, thinking to myself that when the time came, his killer would be judged fairly by God.

Cut to me learning to AP, and having very some interesting results each time. I soon decided that I wanted to actually accomplish a task when astral projecting (not just wandering around aimlessly and enjoying ‘the ride’), and I began to learn about the concept of “soul retrieving,” or, aiding a soul who has passed from this earth into the next realm but for whatever reason was stuck from moving onto a higher realm (or, for many of us, ‘Heaven’). Soul retrievers aim to help these stuck souls; anything from just chatting with them and letting them know that they are indeed dead and that they need to move on, or just offering these troubled souls words of encouragement. I decided that being a soul retriever would be a privilege for me and an amazing opportunity to help a soul in pain.

A few nights before Christmas Eve, I prayed to God, asking him if he’d consider putting me in a position where I could aid a soul who was stuck from entering Heaven. Let’s just say that God is a genius at making us face things that we don’t want to face, and that I never in a million years anticipated what would occur only a few nights later.

As I astral projected that night, I soon found myself at the gates of my uncle’s home, a house I hadn’t thought of or visited in years. I walked past the gate and the entrance garden and I took in the house, crystal clear, exactly as I recalled it as a child (my family had sold my uncle’s home after his death and the family that moved in made extensive renovations). I quickly became joyful at the chance to possibly see my Uncle (my family and I have a history of experiencing visitations from our deceased loved ones) and have a chat with him, so I entered the house from the right side entrance (the entrance that only family members knew to enter), and stepped inside the kitchen, feeling the spiral staircase with my hands and the tile against my feet. “Tio ___?” I called out, smiling ear to ear, excitedly hoping to see him. ""Tio?"" I repeated, hoping for a response from him.

I was just about to take the stairs up (to the second level, where the bedrooms were) when I instinctively stopped. I felt that there was indeed a presence up there, and that it certainly wasn’t my uncle. It was a foreign presence; one that I instinctively distrusted. I then heard some nervous shuffling.
“Who’s there?” a man called out in Spanish, a voice I didn’t recognize. “Are you who I think you are?!” I fearfully yelled out, bracing for the worse, hoping against hope that this wasn’t the man that I dreaded ever meeting. Silence was my response, but a specific kind of silence, the silence of omission and shame and guilt; the silence of remorse for being correctly identified for one’s terrible actions.

I quickly ran out the kitchen and back outside to the front yard, where I looked up at the balcony on the second floor. I’ll never forget what I saw next.
A man emerged onto the balcony, a man with long black hair and the saddest face I have ever seen. His countenance was just so full of regret and shame, and he looked down at me with the saddest eyes in the world, his gaze penetrating me.
“Who are you?!” I asked, wanting to know this man’s name for nearly 20 years.
“M____ N_____,” he replied contritely, knowing full well that I knew who he was and what he did to my family. He looked at me pleadingly, as though seeking help, but I was still in complete shock. God had hand picked me to help soul retrieve my uncle’s murderer, and I found myself at a loss for words. 

I wish I could say I swallowed the bitter pill and that I did God proud, that I forgave this man like God would want any of us to forgive our wrongers, that I showed God and my deceased uncle that I could be the better person, and that I could make good on my request to be a soul retriever. But I came up short, and in the end I proved myself to be an unworthy candidate as a soul retriever.

I impulsively started yelling at the man, telling him off and shaming him for killing my beloved uncle, all the anger that I thought was long gone coming to the surface. “I’m trapped,” he’d call out to me, “I’m stuck!,” his forlorn expression trying to appeal to me on any level, but I was so emotional and angry that I made it clear that I wanted nothing to do with him. I then turned my back on him and walked away from the house, knowing that he couldn’t leave of his own volition. God had crafted this man’s purgatory to consist of being stuck in the house where he committed his worst deed, and being forced to have to relive it over and over again.

I woke up in my bed shaking and crying, and I immediately went to the living room, where my mother was with my sister. I quickly asked her, “was Tio’s murderer’s name ‘M____ N_____?’” and I’ll never forget the face she made-one of shock, pain and disbelief. She burst into tears and left the room, and moments later as I consoled her, she confirmed that this was indeed the man, and as I described his physical features she only cried more, acknowledging that was indeed my uncle’s killer. I cried alongside her, not only because of the memory of my uncle, but because of my failure-my idiocy. 

Why did I choose to fail this opportunity? Why couldn’t I have taken a step back, regained my composure, and somehow tried to help this man? A life of crime had clearly caught up to him and he was now dead and in Purgatory, why couldn’t I forgive and try to love him as Jesus would have done? I felt and still feel so disgusted with myself and I fear that I’ll never again get the chance to be in a position to soul retrieve-that I failed my one shot. 

I just hope that my Tio isn’t too disappointed with me, and that someone else was able to come along and help retrieve this poor guy’s soul when I came up short.

I've been looking for a place to share my experience, and get some feedback, I think this is the place to do it. I did create a new account for this story, because I use Reddit for job networking (and the occasional cat picture) - I don't want my lack of posting history to take away from the ""truthiness"" of my encounter.

So first, a quick backstory. I was raised in a Scottish Irish family in the States. We're loud, we drink, and despite never having seen one, leaving food out for Brownies and pouring a bit of beer into the ground as a libation is a totally normal thing for us to do. My sibs and I were raised in a haunted house (I'm happy to share that story, if you like), and for my thirteen birthday I recieved a ouija board with the following instructions:
""Do not ask if there is a God. Do not ask about Heaven and Hell. Do not ask about aliens. If you bring something into the house, you have to get it out again, and then you will be grounded. Love, Dad"". 
Paranormal discussions and study was just straight up normal in my house.

Snowmageddon,  a few winters ago, I was invited to a blizzard party. You know, bring your best board games, some books, a sleeping bag, and lets get snowed up together. My friend who hosted is a Wiccan, and had all sorts of books to read on magic, ghosts, fairies, what have you. I picked up a book on fairies and read through different types of the fae, how to see them, etc. 

I thought it was an interesting read, but nothing I really wanted to pursue. Something must have stuck with me though, because a weird thing happened the first night I was home.

I had been asleep, and I woke up to something on the bed, right around my knees it felt like something made an impression, like a cat hopping up. I didn't have animals at the time, though, and I lived alone. And, of course, it starts walking. Up toward my face. Because, that's what scary unknowns always do after they land on your bed, apparently. I could move, but I didn't want to sit up, I just kept my eyes open and tried to stay calm. 
What I saw when it got into my sightline is not something I've seen before or since. I saw a little person (a little humanoid?) dressed in black, long hair, about a foot high, taking impossibly large strides up my bed, beside my (terrified) body. It was slender, almost spindly, but well proportioned. I couldn't make out a gender, as it looked pretty androgynous but I ""sensed"" it was male. I remember thinking that it's facial features were as sharp as the rest of him. He did not look at me, or aknowledge me in any way, just went up over my head (I could feel it walking across my pillow, how I did not lose it then, I'll never know) and I heard something hit my bookshelf, like he jumped and landed. 

When I found the courage to turn the light on, there was nothing there. 
I don't know how to go about debunking this, but I can tell you that I had not been drinking, had not been meditating on the existence of the fae, and was not suffering sleep paralysis. I know that I was awake. 

I hesitate telling this story to people because while many people have seen ghosts, most people I know don't even believe in fairies, much less have encountered one. If anyone has experienced something similar, I would love to hear it.

1373491525.0,79,self.Thetruthishere,1i1ale,[Me] Skin Walker Experience.,Nocchi575,97,18,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1i1ale/me_skin_walker_experience/,"Now as a preface I need to make two things clear. One, I know Skinwalker is an inapproproiate term for this, but I hate the word werewolf and it is the only thing I can think of that suits what I saw somewhat.

Two. I was tired at the time but I hold firm to the conviction that I was awake enough to know what I saw, and to know that what I saw was not any type of animal.

While on vacation in Arizona a few weeks ago I was visiting family who live on the edge of the Navajo nation, the town they live in is basically on the border of the reservations and such things. The family in question is my mother's brother and sister. Who live together with their spouses in a modest home, but the home is unimportant. I went there during my childhood every now and then and had several Navajo friends, so after a night out catching up with my two old friends, whose names I will not mention because of the events that took place that night, I was driving the two of them home. The female friend, we will call her Sally, was fast asleep in the right side of the back seat, while the male friend, whom shall be called Frank, was wide awake in the left side of the back seat. As we're on the way to Frank's house I see something on the side of the road that is briefly illuminated by my headlights, it looks like a large coyote walking down the side of the road on all fours. Frank saw it first and pointed it out to me, so I slowed down and turned my brights on. What we both saw disturbed us so deeply that we had to wake Sally up to see if she would confirm that we were not crazy. When Sally woke up and looked out of the window (I had stopped the car at this point) she froze in her place and the thing, which had been walking along at a leisurely pace until now, turned around and stood up on it's hind legs. It did not look like a dog does when it stands on it's legs, it looked like it was used to doing it. And before Sally could shake herself out of the soul crushing fear she was in Frank and I got a good look at it. It was everything the stereotypical definition of a werewolf was with a few key differences, we saw it's snout was less like a wolf's and more like a hybrid between a wolf and a human. Rounded with a dog's nose slightly portruding out and sharp teeth, and it's hands and feet both had claws on them which were seemingly permanently extended, that or it was extremely hostile at the moment it saw us, or rather, her. By the time we were done gawking at the thing and fear started to take over curiosity Sally snapped out of her own fear long enough to scream at me to drive as fast I could. She refused to stop screaming until it was completely out of sight and when we pulled over and she calmed down enough to regain coherency we asked her what was going on. She explained that she could not tell us why but she knew what that thing was and that it wanted nothing but to hurt her and anyone related to her. When I dropped her off at her house I, and Frank as well, felt obligated to walk with her to her door. We asked if she was going to be okay and she said she would tell her dad ""he"" was back and he would protect her ""like he always did"" we just looked at her with concerned looks on our faces and walked back to the car, on the way to Frank's house we saw it again, but it was heading the opposite direction, to Sally's house. We thought it was either another one or the same one which had either gotten lost or ""visited"" someone else and was now going to Sally. Deciding that it was our duty as friends to Sally to try and protect her from whatever this thing was we turned around, but when we did so the creature reared up once again and looked at us, then something I will never forget happened. It let loose a deep, gutteral roar directed at us, a roar so bestial in nature that it shook us both to our cores. Apparently, we were not the only ones that were shaken, as my car's radio died and the engine shut off. I screamed at the top of my lungs, accompanied by Frank, and fumbled to turn it back on. By the time the creature was halfway to our car, it was walking into the road towards us, I got it back on in time to floor it out of there as fast as possible. When I finally got slowed down enough to not break every speed limit in America I realized I had passed Frank's house about three miles back. I didn't see the creature again that night, although I drove by Sally's house again and everything seemed fine, no broken windows or signs of forced entry, and I haven't seen anything like it since. 

I don't know what to call it other than a Skin Walker, but whatever it was, it was hostile, and it plagued either the local community or one of my friends specifically. I have kept in touch with both Frank and Sally and Sally refuses to talk about it, and will only say ""Things are fine."" when I ask about it, Frank can't get anything out of her either.

I was 14. I only remember that it was sometime in the afternoon on a school night. Hours later I woke up and made my way downstairs to a police officer in our foyer, my mom obviously upset/signs of previous crying, my sister glaring at me, and my dad on edge.

Turns out it was around 9PM. My entire family had noticed I was nowhere to be found for a few hours. My dad in his bellowing voice screamed my name, my mom and sister rummaged through the house looking for me. Tearing the covers, sheets, pillows off of every bed. Looking in cabinets, closets, bathrooms, under sinks, you name it. I was 14 so I could not have driven myself anywhere. 

I was there, and then to them it seemed i had been kidnapped. My dad ended up driving through the neighborhood looking on the side of the road, in ditches, etc. 

All I remember after falling asleep in my sister's room was dazily walking down the stairs. My dad and mom and sister swear they tore every room upstairs apart. While screaming, calling, shouting my name. Threatening me if I didn't show up. I recall none of this.

My dad still swears up and down I was NOT in the house. Last weekend I boarded a plane, and while going through security, something sent off the radar on my head. My head was patted. They do that when the metal detector senses it on your head. To my knowledge i have zero metal headware.

1343314768.0,76,self.Thetruthishere,x6x2o,I work overnight at a funeral home. Sometimes I fall asleep and get sleep paralysis then hear strange music and see apparitions. NOT fiction. (x-post from nosleep) [ME/DIS],FuneralHomeGuy,93,17,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/x6x2o/i_work_overnight_at_a_funeral_home_sometimes_i/,"I want to say upfront for the record that I have zero belief in the paranormal and I believe all of what I'm about to tell you is simply a product of the amazing human brain. That said, I realize others will think differently and appreciate this story. And it doesn't mean this whole thing hasn't ever creeped me out. It did and does. 

Anyway, as I said, I work overnight at a funeral home. Basically I babysit the place by myself all night. If someone croaks in the night, I'm there to answer the phones and dispatch someone for the body. I clean up a little and get a few things ready for funerals the next day. Not the most glamorous job, but the job market sucks right now. 

And even with my few duties, I end up with hours to kill every night. I am not technically supposed to sleep on the job. That said, sometimes I do. I'll nod off at the desk, or sometimes I'll go lay down on one of the couches and take a power nap. I'm alone all night (other than a handful of bodies in different rooms) and it's boring. I think most people would do the same. 

The weird thing is, I get sleep paralysis pretty regularly when I fall asleep at work. Although there have been very few times when someone has shown up at the funeral home in the middle of the night unannounced, I am always fearful one of the directors will show up unexpectedly and catch me sleeping. I believe this fear causes me to sleep lightly and to have sleep paralysis, because I rarely have it at home. 

Now, for those of you who have never had sleep paralysis, basically it's like this: Your eyes are open and you're seeing your surroundings, but you're not *actually* awake. So sometimes, you still see or hear dream things. Like maybe you see something that isn't there, or whatever. And you can't move. It feels as though you're being held down and you can't wake up. It feels as if you are straining against something when you try. For myself, I can usually ""snap"" myself out of it and wake up if I strain and thrash against it hard enough, and then I come awake suddenly and am able to move. Google it if you want a more information about it. It's interesting. 

Now, on to the weirdness that began to happen when I would slip into sleep paralysis during a nap...

The first was the music. Sometimes when I would find myself lying there with my eyes open in sleep paralysis, I would begin to hear music, loudly and vividly. It was almost always Christian gospel music, but modern stuff like you'd hear on the radio. It always sounded like it was coming from inside my skull, too, particularly my mouth area. This sounds stupid, but at one point I even began to wonder if I was picking up some AM Christian station in my fillings and was only sensitive enough to hear it while asleep, or maybe when my mouth was hanging open and dried out. I even went so far as to remember one of the lyrics from one of the songs and Google it when I woke up, although it didn't appear to be a real song. (Sorry, I don't remember the lyric any more as this was months and months ago.)

Then, the weirder thing started happening. Sometimes when I'd fall into this sleep paralysis, I would think I heard someone walking toward me from one of the hallways. Fearing that an employee had shown up unexpectedly, I would always frantically strain against the sleep paralysis and wake up, at which point the sound of footsteps was gone. After that, I always felt foolish for getting tricked by dream sounds. 

This went on for months and months, the music and the footsteps. Always when I'd hear the footsteps I'd err on the side of caution and force myself awake in case it really was another employee, only to be annoyed at having gone through the effort for nothing and having ruined a perfectly good nap. 

One night, while I was particularly tired and napping on a couch, I slipped into this state and heard the footsteps. I decided--screw it--I wasn't going to get tricked by my sleep paralysis for the millionth time. So I just laid there, expecting I would either eventually wake up normally (without the strain) or I would go back to full sleep, or that the stupid footsteps would continue the way the music always did if I just laid there stuck in that state for a bit. 

**Nope.**  To my complete surprise, the ""footstepper"" showed himself. 

I was laying on my back stretched out, and a man came walking up from the direction of my head, coming into my field of view and stopping directly next to me. There was nothing particularly memorable about him, just a white male in some kind of dress shirt and slacks, except for one thing: his face and head were obscured. They were blurred out, just like they do on the news for anonymous witnesses or whatever. Just like that. His head and face were obviously there, but I could see nothing but a smeary blur. 

Then, to my horror, he reached out and poked me lightly in the forehead and let out a kind of sinister chuckle. Sinister is probably the wrong word. It was more like he was laughing as if to say, ""Yeah, feel real brave now, don't you?""

And at that point, of course, I snapped myself awake and found myself alone as always. It was very disturbing, of course, to say the least. Probably not as much for most, though, to be honest, because I truly have NO belief in ghosts or the paranormal and chalked it up to brain tricks. But since then, it's happened twice more. 

The second time I saw someone, I found myself with my eyes open in sleep paralysis staring at--I shit you not--a woman wearing a rubber clown mask and holding a gun at her side, just staring at me passively. Thankfully, I knew immediately that it was just my sleep paralysis and didn't panic, but I was unnerved enough to force myself awake and cause the woman to vanish. 

The third time was similar to the first. I was laying on the couch and this time a small child approached me from behind. I think it was a boy but can't say for sure, probably about 6 or 7, and his face was also blurred the same way the man's had been. He giggled once in amusement. I was immediately scared to the point I forced myself awake. Of all the times it had happened, that was the most disturbing by far. 

And that's it. That's my story. Sorry it doesn't have a better resolution, but as I said this is all true and I don't really believe there's anything paranormal going on here. 

But it is fucking freaky, no?

But I do would love this story as my dad is a firm believer of this and I can't deny there is some kind of oddity going on.

My grandmother always lived an incredibly full life. She was active during the war and active until her final weeks. A week before her death she suddenly fell ill. Now as I said she has always been this incredibly active woman and she has been keeping my grandfather strong during his old age. He was always frailer than her so it was a huge shock when she died before him. She died at the hospital after suffering a heartattack. During the days between her heart attack and her death she acted very happy and very much like her old self. Joking around with us, telling us to be good kids. She even, and this is something I discovered later, arrenged parts of her funeral during this last week.She seemed very much aware that she would die and she seemed very okay with it. 

We had this old standing clock in her livingroom. She had bought it with her first paycheck with the motto only rich people have such a clock. And she was extremely proud of it. The clock had this pendulum and on the night of her death this pendulum suddenly fell. It stopped the clock at exactly 3:47AM. It made a huge racket and my father awoke due to it. While being a bit dumbfounded by this happening the phone rang, he picked up and the hospital had just called the death of my grandmother.

Over the years this story had been repeaten by my dad, who was convinced this was a sign of an afterlife. My grandfather suffered from her death, he lost himself into alzheimers and forgot she even ever existed. When he died my father seemed very pleased that finally they were back together.

We were sitting in the house which we had shared with our grandparents for many years to prepare my grandfather's funeral. My grandmother loved keeping holiday cards around and they hung from the wall. Hundreds of them for every occassion. Among them was a card they had written, but never posted, for an estranged grandchild. In my grandmother's handwriting it said: ""Just because you have forgotten me, does not mean I have forgotten you.""

When we were mourning my grandfather and discussing the funeral and what it should say on the prayercard, this card fell down from the wall. It really touched my dad and he was moved to tears when he read it.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_unm3u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/unm3u/grandmother_mourned_her_husbands_death_3_years/,

I was really interested in the paranormal, and I asked her if she had any weird experiences in her life regarding that.

She told me that when she was a little girl, she lived in a house that was normal for the most part.  The only thing that occurred with some frequency was hearing footsteps walking toward the kitchen when nobody was downstairs.

The only notable thing she experienced in the house was once when she had gone to sleep with her parents after having a bad dream.  She said that she and her mom woke up at the same time, and both of them looked at the door to the bedroom, and it just slammed shut, and they could hear the typical footsteps going to the kitchen. She said that the door opened into the bedroom, so they would have seen someone closing the door had someone been there.  The door slam also woke up her dad.

She also told me an experience her brother had.  He was laying down on the couch in the living room, which was next to the kitchen. He saw someone out of the corner of his eye heading to the kitchen, and after a few seconds, he said ""Hey, dad.""  He didn't get a response so he looked to see who it was and no one was there.

When they moved out of the house, the family that moved in next was remodeling. Apparently her family got a call asking if they knew about a staircase under the kitchen floor that they had found when they took out the floor.  It led down to a very small room that was extremely dirty, but empty other than dust and cobwebs.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1aidw3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1aidw3/some_experiences_my_childhood_therapist_shared/,

I'm just going to get straight to the point and list my experiences. Some are from my journal that I kept after things got to noticeable to ignore. Left some things out because they were pretty much the same thing happening again.

1. I was laying in bed about a month after moving in. (I lived alone) I was awoken by the distinct feeling that something was crawling onto my bed. I felt and saw the bed sink in. Shat bricks but I was exhausted so I dozed off again.

2. I was studying for school so I turned off everything except my lamp so that I could study in silence, Out of my wall I heard a crystal clear female voice say ""Hello?"" ...Like my wall was talking to me. It had bass to it so it resonated through me.

3. My radio turned on by itself on and volume was raised all the way up at 3:47 a.m, song that was playing was Ozzy's ""Shot in the dark"".

4. I was awoken again one night by my bed shaken vigorously at around 3 am. I thought it might have been a tremor so I shrugged it off and went back to bed. Then I remembered that only my bed was shaking and nothing else in my room or apartment was disturbed. 

5. I was having my forever alone t.v dinner reading over one of my essays for school. I hear a loud rumbling roar that sounded like a Lion roar. It shook me straight to my core I said nope! enough is enough I am outta here I left to my parents house that night.

At this point I am questioning my sanity and the apartment is making me stress out because I can't afford to move out. This stress cripples my ability to focus in school. 

6. Sitting on my couch watching a comedy movie trying to lighten the mood, I see a mass blacker than black with four legs running like a dog across the hallway in to my bedroom...slept on the couch that night, With the help of Nyquil and all the lights on.

7. Finally the straw that broke the camels back, I was laying in bed having trouble going to bed around 2:40 a.m when I hear someone walking in my room, only I can't see them. The footsteps sounded heavy and I had tile so whatever it was had to be stomping while walking towards my bed, It gets dead silent for a few seconds until all of a sudden I get a shock pass through my body (It felt surreal) and then my king size bed starts shaking violently with me on it. I felt like I was on a carnival ride, from hell! I spring up from my bed to get my car keys and I start to hear the walls around me being banged, As if several sets of hands were slapping the walls. I damn near killed my self trying to hastily leave that apartment, knocking things over and jammed my foot on a wall because I slid on my socks across the floor. 

I never went back (only to retrieve my belongings) but other than that I broke lease and never returned.

1374642720.0,78,self.Thetruthishere,1ixs62,[fam] Navajo friend recounted a skinwalker tale that happened to her mom.,redheadedalex,92,14,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1ixs62/fam_navajo_friend_recounted_a_skinwalker_tale/,"Note: I know, it’s been awhile. life and shit.  Also, I pretty much have drained the reserves of skinwalker stories from my family as it’s like pulling teeth to get them to talk about this, but I had totally forgotten until recently, my Navajo friend told me a personal story years and years ago that I never shared.  I emailed her asking for an update since I forgot the details and here they are, as told to her by her mother, put together by me. 


This story happened to my friend’s (we’ll call her Kat) mom.  Kat was just a kid, and had an older brother and a younger brother.  They all lived on the res of the Navajo Nation with their parents in your standard Navajo trailer.  Kat’s dad was a police officer for the Navajo Nation so he was out a lot and there were many nights spent with just their mom.  No worries though, because Kat’s mom was independent, strong, alpha as fuck, and not afraid of the vast endless desert around her or animals or any of that shit.  

One night business as usual.  Dad is out working a long grave shift, kids are being total assholes and won’t go to bed, Kat’s mom is trying to coax them to bed with watching movies in the bedroom and they start whining for a snack.  (It’s already way past dinner at this point.)  She leaves them with the movie, and goes into the kitchen and gets out six slices of bread, three pieces of bologna (res status=pro) and cheese and mayo, as she is about to put these fine artesian sandwiches together she hears a sound and turns to look at the front door.

The front door is wide as fuck open and there’s a woman in the doorway.  She’s short, thin, and white, with blond hair.  She was dressed for summer apparently with shorts and a t shirt on and flip flops and she had a pixie haircut. And she was dirty and raggedy, which is not uncommon if you’ve ever been around the res land. White people on the res are kind of a joke, depending on where they go it can be reeeeally dangerous for them, so they’re not seen as much of a threat.  Apparently Kat’s mom was of the attitude of “what the fuck are you doing in my house?”  She asked the woman several things, like, what are you doing here, do you need help, etc.  The woman didn’t reply and seemed to be in a weird state of mind.

Being a cop’s wife her first impression was that this was some white moron who’d tried a little too much peyote and got lost from her moron friends in the desert.  So she was being pretty harsh to the girl and was kind of pissed that she’d gotten into the house with no words at all in the first place.  Kat’s mom got annoyed when the girl wouldn’t answer her and just stood there kind of giggling and shrugging her shoulders.  So she put her hands on the girl’s shoulders and literally pushed her outside onto the porch steps of the trailer and the woman just stood there, looking at the ground and giggling and kind of shivering.  And Kat’s alpha mom was like “You need to get out of here.  Go on. Get.”

And this was when she realized something was off.  She had first thought the girl was on drugs or something, but she was looking at her like a cop sizes up a perp and the girl had zero track marks or anything, no bruises either, no nothing except covered in dirt like she’d wallowed in it.  She smelled bad too, like a wild animal.  So Kat’s mom stood there slowly realizing that maybe she wasn’t taking this seriously enough.  And the woman on the porch steps really started to jitter then, kind of like she was cold, but more unnaturally.  And this was in summer in the Arizona desert so there should have been no need for that.  Kat’s mom slammed the door, which had one of those diamond windows on it that trailers have, and she could see the woman violently spasming through the glass.  She looked away for seconds, just to lock and deadbolt the door and when she looked back, the woman was gone.  





Kat’s mom said her first thought was to go to the kids, so she did.  They were in their room and the baby was crying, Kat and her older brother were scared.  They hadn’t seen the woman but heard their mom talking to someone and could tell that their mom was scared, too.  So she decided to stay in the bedroom with them.  Apparently this was the safe part of the trailer, since they blessed it with cedar smoke often (for the kids) and there were eagle feathers hanging up on the walls and doorways (to the Navajo, these keep bad spirits away.) 

So, she laid there and watched movies with the kids and eventually they fell asleep.  Kat’s mom said she heard some things moving around outside, but this is the desert on the res, so that’s kind of an every night thing and something she’s used to.  Apparently she was more afraid to go into the kitchen, and couldn’t shake the feeling of why.  She just had this feeling of dread.  This was before the days of cell phones so she had no way of getting in touch with anyone.  A few hours passed and things had been quiet but she couldn’t sleep, so she decided to call her husband.  The phone was in the living room, which meant she would have to go near the kitchen, but not into it.  She snuck out of the kids’ room and grabbed the phone, called the station, and they got confirmation that her husband was okay and out on patrol.  They asked if she would like an officer sent to her area to make sure things were okay, and Kat’s mom agreed.  She went back to the bedroom to wait for the knock on the door.  She was a good half hour from anywhere, driving distance, but pretty soon the officer came.

He was a coworker of her husbands, so they knew each other, and he was obviously Navajo as welll, and Kat’s mom said that he seemed nervous and jumpy while standing on her porch.  He took a statement from her of what had happened but he said he’d seen no one on the roads, definitely nobody fitting that description.  They set up a patrol to search the area for the night just in case, and they discussed maybe burning some sage or cedar since the air seemed bad...in a creepy, off way, not a smelly way....and she thanked him and went into the kitchen.  Seeing the officer and having a conversation had calmed her down enough that she didn’t feel the need to barricade in the bedroom anymore.  So she went over to the kitchen (burning cedar and sage is usually done on the stovetop) and it was then that she noticed the counter and Kat said her mother was the most terrified she’d ever been in her life.   

The bread, bologna, and cheese were gone.  Completely gone, though they’d been there hours earlier and she for a fact had not moved them, and had also for a fact deadbolted the door.  Kat’s mom’s theory is that the “woman” had come back into the trailer while everyone was in the bedroom and had taken the food, and that’s why she (the mom) had instinctively been afraid to come back in that area.  

As far as I know that’s the one incident where something got into their home.  She’s never told me of anything else, but I can double check with her if you guys like!

I know I promised more skinwalker stories on my other posts/comments, but there's two things; 1) my Navajo fam is going through some rough personal stuff at the moment and it's not really appropriate to dig for ghost stories and 2) it's really against tradition and rules to talk about this stuff openly if at all.  If some of them knew I was sharing it on Reddit I'd probably get skinned, lol. OR SCALPED /RACIST

  But I did manage to get one more story for now.

This happened to my older brother, who we can call ""David"" again.  It was back in the early 2000's and he was a senior in high school in a small po-dunk Utah town.  Being a senior and a football player, he was kind of an asshole and did stupid things, one of which included walking through the woods late at night to, as he called it, ""throw rocks and terrorize kids from school.""  Yes, immature, I know, but he and his accomplice (another Navajo called ""Sean"") were seniors and tackles on the football team.  They walked through the woods because cops patrolled the streets, and there was a city curfew in place.  The route they took went through a state park which has lots of Navajo artifacts and even a kiva which you can go down into.  

So one night they were sneaking through the forest before the sun had risen, and they had begun to stop and shush each other because they could sometimes hear footsteps in the distance.  Unless some other football geniuses had the idea to walk through the desert, there should have been no one else out there.  This continued for awhile, until Sean stopped David, grabbed him and said, ""Get down!"" 

They dropped to their stomachs and hid, listening.  Now the footsteps, crunching through the dry desert foliage, were accompanied by mumbling.  David estimated that the sounds were maybe 100 feet away at first, but got closer.  He doesn't know if the mutterings were Navajo or English or some other language.  After awhile of the noises staying fairly far away, Sean whispered without looking, ""It sounds like a drunk.""  Several more minutes and David decided to chance a peek, as the ""drunk"" sounded more distant now.  

It was night, but the moon was bright and the light bounced off the canyon wall nearby.  David was looking for a man, but instead he saw a figure which he said ""moved with a tilt to its body"" and was ""long and tall."" It was human formed, and walking on two feet, but misshappen and VERY tall.   He said it maybe resembled a kokopelli or Navajo kachina doll, so not exactly normal shaped.  It mumbled and drifted through the trees seemingly looking for something.   He was pretty captivated, watching it for a few minutes and then suddenly the snapping twigs and the mutterings just stopped.  Everything was quiet.  And the figure, whatever it was, had just disappeared.

After that, David and Sean both ""felt"" that whatever was in the forest at the time was gone.  They sat on the ground afterward discssusing what had just happened.  Sean asked about what David had seen, and then stated ""I didn't look because if I would have, it would have known we were both staring.""  

I forgot to ask him if he and Sean went back through the woods, but the answer is probably yes.  This kind of happening is pretty common within the Navajo culture and it's something they're used to dealing with.  Personally I would have shit myself, but that's another story for another day.   I do have stories about an old church I worked in, but they're not skinwalker stories.  Still if you guys are interested, I'll give it a shot.

These stories got me fascinated with the paranormal from that moment on, so I thought I'd share them.

My great-uncle and his wife and two daughters moved into the house in the late 1960s when his kids were pretty young.  The girls each picked their own bedrooms.  In the morning after one of the first nights they all slept over at the house, one of the little girls came downstairs for breakfast and asked, ""Mom, why did you let your friends come up to my room last night?""  My great-aunt told her that she must have been dreaming, that she hadn't had anyone over that night.  About an hour later, the other daughter woke up and came downstairs (having had no interaction with her sister yet that morning) and told her mother, ""Mom, why were those people standing around my bed last night?""

After that, my great-aunt was understandably shaken.  It wasn't long until she had her own experience, either.  She was downstairs in the cellar organizing shortly after moving in when she turned around to go up the cellar stairs and saw a woman dressed in Revolutionary War-era clothes at the top of the stairs.  My great-aunt retreated to the back of the basement until she was brave enough to check again, and by the time she returned to the stairwell, the colonial woman had disappeared.

It wasn't the last that the family saw of the woman, however.  They would see the woman passing through the living room relatively frequently.  Years later, when they renovated the house, they realized that the wall she was ""disappearing"" through used to have a door in it!  Also during the renovations, my great-uncle took pictures of the rooms that he had redone.  When he had the pictures developed, one of them had a clear figure of a woman floating about 2 feet off the ground in the corner of one of the bedrooms.  He didn't show me that picture until I was a little bit older, as it is pretty creepy. 

Apparently the activity tapered off as my mom's cousins got older, but the one thing that happened continually, even as the girls became teenagers, was that when my great-aunt would put flowers in a vase, some of the flowers would be removed from the vase and placed elsewhere.

The last time I saw my great-uncle before he died, I asked him if he ever saw the colonial lady anymore.  He said that since he was getting older and not feeling well, he moved his bedroom from upstairs to downstairs.  He said that he hadn't seen the lady in years until he made this move.  He said that sometimes he would wake up in the middle of the night and she would be leaning over him, much closer than he had ever been to her before.  I said, ""Ew, how creepy!"" He was really funny about it, though, and said, ""Oh no, I don't mind!  She's beautiful!""

One night my uncle was driving back from town through the country to his home. It was not an area that he was familiar with, it was farm country with few homes and large distances between them. He ran out of gas.

He walked up the road to the first farmhouse. There was a gas pump out front as many farmers keep a decent supply on hand. He walked up the driveway and knocked on the door. An elderly couple answered and he explained his situation. They were kind and happy to help. The husband got him a can and they went to the pump and he put a couple of gallons of gas from the pump into the can. My uncle walked back to the car and put the gas in the tank. He brought the can back and offered them some money for the gas. They wouldn't take any money and just said they were glad they could help. He thanked them and drove home.

My uncle looks like a lumber jack. He was 6' 6"" tall over 300 lbs with a full beard. He was one of those gentle giant kind of guys and although you would never guess it by looking at him one of his favorite things was to bake pies. So the next day he bakes a pecan pie to bring back to the couple who gave him the gas. He drove back to the house and knocked on the door, but nobody was home.

He drove down the road to the next house and went to the door to see if he could leave the pie with the neighbors. When he talked to the neighbors they told him the house he was talking about had been abandoned. Figuring he must have gone to the wrong house he drove along the road looking for the right place. When he couldn't find another farmhouse that looked anything like the one he got the gas from he drove back a second time.

The gas pump was there and he was sure that it was the right house, but it was empty. He went back to the neighbors again and said he had been to the house the night before and an elderly couple had given him gas. He described them to the neighbors and they said, the people you're describing used to live there, but they've been dead for years.

After he told the story, I asked him what he thought and he said he couldn't explain it. He went back to the farm to check the pump and it wasn't working. This was the only story of this kind I had ever heard him tell. He wasn't a boaster or an exaggerator and he told the story sort of matter of factly, like I don't know I can't explain it.

I only heard him tell the story once and he seemed reluctant to share it until his wife prodded him. I don't know what to think of these kinds of stories and am usually skeptical, but I've never known my uncle to lie. I really believe it happened just the way he said it did. I don't know how it's possible, but somehow it did happen.

On New Years Eve of 2008 I attended a party at a friend's apartment. The complex was big and new-ish, probably built within the last 20 years or so. I had had a beer or two, but was not buzzed and hadn't taken any drugs that evening. 

Around the climax of the party, I decided that I could go for a cigarette, so I exited my friend's apartment by his sliding glass door and went outside. Behind the apartment building was a grassy area, with a little stand of Birch trees about 25 feet away. As I was smoking, I wandered towards the little stand of trees and stood beneath them, looking up at the apartment building in front of me. 

The apartment building was three stories high, and as I was looking, I noticed a movement in one of the third story windows. Because it was night time, and because the room was illuminated, I could see in to it fairly well.

It looked as if someone were sitting on the edge of a bed, rocking back and forth. Because of the angle of the window from where I was standing, I could only see their shoulders/upper torso, and just assumed they were sitting on a bed. My immediate thought was that maybe the person was upset, because I know when I'm really upset or stressed, I have a tendency to rock myself back and forth, but as I looked, I noticed that there were no distinct features that I could identify, it just looked like a solid black cut-out of a person. 

So, as I'm standing there, watching this 'person' rock back and forth, I get the creepy feeling that this 'person' is suddenly aware of my awareness of it, like somehow it knew I was watching and was feeding on my energy/reaction. Slowly, it began to move about in a really unnatural way, standing up from whatever it was sitting on. Its arms lifted up and out from it's body and began to basically undulate. It almost looked like pop and lock style dancing, but the arms were bending in ways that a human arm could not possibly bend, like it had joints in all the wrong places. Fear erupted inside of me because I realized that it wasn't human, not even a little bit.

I stood there staring at it because I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I wanted to run, but it was so weirdly compelling that I just stood there, watching.

As it was doing its scary arm thing, it started to slowly back in to the center of the room, until I couldn't see it anymore, but I could still FEEL it there. 
 
I ran back to my friend's apartment, but all I could think about was that I was in the same building as that thing! I got my friends together and we left right away because I was so freaked out, but for some reason, I couldn't explain to them what I had seen.

My name is Livia, and I am a backup singer in the band King Diamond.
         
I wanted to post this story here, because it has truly crept us out ever since we saw the picture (attached at the end of the post).    
    
We were playing at a big metal music festival as headline act in Sweden, called Sweden Rock Festival, this past June.    
The show went perfect, and we were very happy afterwards and buzzing with energy.   
     
A day later back in Copenhagen, we asked the photographer if he would load all the pictures he took during the show over to my computer, so we can go through it all and pick the best ones. We did that, then as soon as the transfer was over, we went out to eat at a restaurant with him. We didn't look at the pictures.    
    
While at the restaurant, a strange thing happened. Me and my husband (the singer in the band) were drinking Irish coffee, and I finished mine. The photographer had to leave to catch his flight, so we stood up to say goodbye and wished him good travels.   
    
When we sat back down, my husband says to me: ""Haha, very funny.""   
I ask, ""What?""    
He answers ""You put your straw across the top of my coffee cup, why would you do that?""    
I say ""I didn't do it. Why would I do something weird like that?""   
    
Sure enough, my thick straw (the kind they give you at restaurants to drink your soda with) was lying neatly right across the top of his cup.   
We have no idea how it got there.     
    
We took a walk after dinner, then headed back to the hotel.   
We really wanted to see the pictures the photographer took, so we started going through them and examining each one.     
When we got about 3/4 way through the lot (there were many pictures), I clicked to show the next one.    
    
I don't think I registered it in my brain at first just what it was I was seeing. It creeped both of us the hell out so bad, that we could only stare for a while.    
   
On the picture, you can see my husband with the lantern, swaying back and forth. On the podium, you see our actress, Jodi.   
    
Well...    
    
What is visible of her anyway.   
   
She is supposed to be this dark shape (the song we play at the moment is called ""Shapes of Black""), moving towards my husband, at a speed SLOWER than how he's swaying back and forth.    
   
We cannot explain where her top half is gone.    
    
Some people say it's motion blur, but that can't be. Firstly, she is moving slower than my husband, who is only a little bit blurred. Secondly, I have never seen motion blur cut someone off *at the middle of their thigh* like a razor, where there are obviously no joints to move differing ways.    
   
An interesting tidbit came just a month ago or so, when I was uploading the picture on cubeupload, so we can show it to our fans.    
    
If you see the link, you understand why.    
   
As everyone (or most of those who use the internet) knows, when you upload a picture to an image site, you get random letters and numbers assigned after the .com .    
    
My blood ran a bit cold when what is supposed to be something akin to "".com/hIao8R"", instead spelled out "".com/DammNU"".    
Damn you?     
    
A day later or so, we got a tweet from cubeupload on our official Twitter page, saying ""It is totally random, we promise!""     
    
P.S.: We tried to find video recordings of the happening, but for some very strange reason, no full recording of that one song can be found.    
Not only that, but when we did find a recording that had that part in it, a person walks right in front of the camera at that moment, blocking the view. Coincidence? Perhaps.      
Perhaps not...
     
Here is the link to the picture: http://i.cubeupload.com/DammNU.jpg

(very long read)",TheHiddenCount,83,10,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1k3pgs/pic_me_fam_ive_only_ever_told_this_story_to_a_few/,"Hello fellow truth seekers!

I recently created this account to post my several paranormal and strange stories specifically. This following story is one that remains very close to my heart, and I will do my best to tell it with as little exaggeration as possible. I will tell you in all the detail so you are able to experience it through my eyes, so I apologize for the long read, but as I said this is a very special story and I'm writing it out for the first time.

I will begin by saying that I am a sceptic as well as an agnostic athiest. I always question everything, and will be the first to accept a scientific or logical explanation for the seemingly unexplainable. I believe, with the possibility and even probability of multidimensions and universes, that strange things can and DO happen, yet our current technology limits our understanding and ability to explain these occurrences.

 Thus begins my story.

I love ducks. I love ducks and waterfowl so much, and they are second to none on my list of favorite animals. I think my love may have stemmed from that movie Fly Away Home, which I had watched as a little kid. I remember feeling so much joy and love when that little girl hatched those eggs under the electric blanket. I know the movie was about geese, but I became fascinated by the idea of imprinting, and developed a healthy obsession for knowledge about ducks/geese/swans and their social behavior. 

During my childhood, my father attempted to hatch eggs with me a few times, but each time we remained unsuccessful. (Though a smart man, he had little understanding of just how delicate the process was, and how to distinguish fertile eggs from infertile.)

By the time I was 16, I had owned every animal you can imagine. everything from Red Eared Sliders to iguanas to snakes to cats, parakeets, hamsters....I really have an affinity for animals. None have died in my care (except from simply getting old....rodents have short life spans.) and I've only ever given them away when I couldn't care for the animal myself. 

At the time I had my awesome dog and some cute little fish. My mom had made it clear that she didn't want any more animals in the house. Well, I had recently gotten a decent paying job, and one day the feeling just came over me. I felt I wanted to raise two ducks. Call it an impulse, perhaps some act of rebellion from a teenager who loves animals. I became damned determined and was willing to go behind my mother's back. Better than doing drugs, I suppose.  

I didn't want to just purchase ducks, however. No, I wanted to incubate my own eggs... from day one.

Before I decide to adopt any animal, I do a TON of research. Luckily this time the internet was at my disposal. I research EVERYTHING from duck care, to the proper temp and humidity for egg incubation. Since I couldn't afford a fancy incubator, [I opt for this cheap plastic one](http://www.critter-cages.com/images/gq09100.jpg) which I bought online. It's made for classroom and educational purposes, I suppose. This incubator is extremely tricky. In fancier incubators, there is usually a rack, which turns the eggs, and a self adjusting monitor for temp and humidity regulation. The success rate of my incubator, since I had to turn the eggs manually 7 times a day and regulate the temp and humidity myself, was about 50%.

After the incubator came, I went to buy my eggs from a local duck farmer. He has a carton full and tells me he believes they're all freshly laid and fertile, and if I happen to pick a non fertile egg, that I can come back and get another one. I pick out two good looking eggs.

It takes 28 days for most ducks to hatch. I sang, played my guitar, left music on for them when I left for school or work. I talked to them. It's known that the bonding process begins before the babies even hatch, simply by hearing the mother duck's voice. A mother duck will softly 'talk' to her eggs as she rotates them, making a little 'wuhwuhwuh' noise. I tried to emulate that by talking softly to them as I rotated them. I began to feel a very strong connection with them, even before they hatched. I would candle them every day to check for abnormalities.

Eventually my mother found out....but after her initial rage from me hiding the ducks from her, she finally came around (she knew about my affinity for ducks and all animals, and said that as long as I paid for everything and was responsible, she would let me keep them). She was even involved in helping me with the hatching process! The whole family became involved. 

The special day rolls around, and I was so happy that BOTH of the eggs had developed completely. They were right on schedule. 

[Here are some screenshots of the video we took of them hatching](http://imgur.com/a/fEeuv) (I still tear up when I watch this video):

Fast forward some, and they're starting to get big. It is also known that birds, although intelligent, can not be potty trained (for any length of time) because of their lack of sphincter muscles. For this they make bird diapers. Birds, as I'm sure you all know, poop A LOT. The ducks poop was getting a little out of hand and REALLY big. My mom finally decided that I needed to build a pen for them outside (I took them outside regularly but we have a lot of hawks in the area so I was always on guard. They stayed inside and wandered the house otherwise. The poop became too much to deal with, even for me, who is experienced in the cleaning of animal poop. 

I have NO experience with pen building at this point, but do as much research as I could. I also spent about 200 on building materials (all my own money) and was out day and night, doing the best I could with my stepdad's tools, some help from my brother, and my own perseverance. The enclosure ended up being pretty decent. I made sure to make it as large as possible, and it was entirely closed in with chicken wire, including the floor, with a hinged door so I could enter. I even built a little shelter area, and bought a plastic kiddie pool for them. I was really quite proud of it. They loved being outside, naturally. (they were old enough now to secrete their own oil. little ducks don't secrete oil, which keeps them waterproof, so the mother duck has to use her own oil in order to waterproof them until they're old enough. Otherwise their feathers saturate with water and they will sink and drown. Obviously I don't secrete duck oil...)

At this point, they might as well have been my children. I named the black duck Anser (Pronounced Ahn-cere- the Latin word for goose) and the Pekin duck Ooccoo (for those of you who've played Twilight princess, it's the name of the half chicken half human you find in the dungeons). Tell me that the loyalty and connection of a dog to a human is unmatched, and I will tell you bullshit- and I love dogs. I'd go out every day after school, let them out, sit down, and they would waddle in to my lap and demand to be pet by nibbling me. Ducks give little beak kisses as a sign of affection, and it feels like soft little nibbles. I would run out every day and call 'DUCKS, DUCKS!' to which they'd respond with a little happy duck noise. It's not so much of a quack as it is a soft excited 'wahkwahkwahkwahk!' My love for them was and is still unmatched...I say this even though the dog I have now is the love of my life. 
 
About 3 weeks pass, every day I spend with them is more enjoyable than the last. Their final adult feathers are almost fully grown, and they're beginning to look as beautiful as ever. 

One early morning I awake to my dog barking (she loved the ducks too and protected them when we were all out in the yard. I think seeing a dog play with ducks is the cutest unnatural thing you could witness).

I run to the door to see that my mom had already let the dog out. She told me, ""you might want to go check on the ducks. Zora just chased something in to the woods..."" My. Heart. Sank.

I go outside. I start walking quickly back to the pen, which was out of my field of vision. 

I scream 'DUCKS!!!' .....No answer
'DUCKS!!!!' ......silence 

Subconsciously I knew what had happened before I even got to the pen. As I walk up....all I see is a bunch of feathers scattered across the floor. I look in the kiddie pool, which had gotten muddy enough to where you couldn't see anything under the water (it was due for a cleaning) and the water was muddy red. The stench of death was in the air.

 I could barely make it out (I have terrible eyesight, and I wasn't wearing my glasses) but I see something...In the pool, floating gently, was the lower half of Ooccoo's body- the tail and the hindside- bobbing up and down. Anser was nowhere in sight. 

I collapsed to the floor, screaming louder than I ever had. I think I might have even fainted. My mom ran out, and then I rushed in to my room. I didn't come out all day, and my mom let me stay home from school. The whole family cried, but I was a wreck. I had never cried all day before. I only left to use the restroom....I wouldn't eat, and I didn't talk to ANYONE, not even my brother. I slept and cried and then fell back asleep and then woke up again and cried myself back to sleep. My mom had called my stepdad home from work, and he dealt with the bodies since neither I nor my Mom could bare it.

This is where the supernatural part of my story begins. 

That night I have a dream. It's more vivid than any regular dream. I'm in this strange room and there's a chimney, a human sized chimney made of brick. [It looked kind of like this, but the opening was big enough to walk through.](http://www.doityourself.com/forum/attachments/bricks-masonry-asphalt-concrete/9292d1361029352-need-advice-turning-arched-fireplace-opening-rectangular-p1010588.jpg)

I approach the chimney and a bright light flashes, then...standing there in the room, were Ooccoo and Anser, except they were human size. I then notice something a little off about them....

Ooccoo's beak was missing. As though it were a half of a beak. Anser's stomach was dented- concave if you will. It wasn't gory, they were just missing parts.

I remember apologizing to them and screaming that I'm so sorry. I should have built the cage better to keep stronger animals out. I said that I'll take even better care of them if they just come back. I said that I was a bad person, and guilty for not being extra careful with the cage. 

All of a sudden a feeling of calm washes over me. They never talked verbally, it was as though my head was ringing with 'words'. I am told that everything will be alright. that I was loved, that they loved me and in the end, love is all that matters.  Love that spans over individuals, cultures, species, and the entire universe. Then they 'told' me that it was time for them to leave, and they would be one with the universal everything again. That it was peaceful and not to worry. I screamed that I loved them and they were back up the chimney in a flash of light.

The next day I told my parents of the dream, crying while I did so. I told them that it was weird about the missing beak and stomach....My stepdad went white (he's pretty stoic and secretive, and his emotions are difficult to read, but I could see that he was shaken.) He then said, after some pause (not word for word, but as best as I can remember), ""I didn't want to give you guys any details about this, but when I pulled Ooccoo's body out of the water, his beak had been bitten off. Anser was by the woods, and her stomach had been eviscerated.""

I look at them in shock...my mom puts her hands to her mouth. My stepdad hadn't told her or anyone about what he saw, as it had just happened a day ago and we were all still very upset. 

In closing, a few things: I have TERRIBLE eyesight. I can't read text a few feet from my face let alone make out fine details from something that is more than 10 feet away. The water was extremely murky with blood and dirt, plus I obviously didn't stand around investigating. Also, I never walked past the pen. The woods is a long distance away, and there is no fucking way I saw Anser. Just no way. 

Now, I myself have a few logical explinations:

My stepdad really DID tell my mom, and I somehow heard him talk about it 3 rooms away with two doors closed while I was sleeping. My mind then created the dream as a coping mechanism for the trauma.

I DID see Ooccoo's beak subconsciously (i swear I didn't, i couldn't see anything past the water, and again-I have very poor eyesight.), and my brain deduced that Anser must have been eviscerated since that is usually what predators will do to their prey before consuming them. 

But something in my mind- something in my heart- and however you want to think of a soul, knows that my ducks came to me before they left for good. They came to me one more time- before they entered the great unknown and merged back into whatever we perceive as existence, and I felt our mutual and unconditional love as they left. A pure love that transcends time, space, and everything above and below. I'm tearing up right now, so I'll stop there. 

[Sadly, these are the only pictures I could find](http://imgur.com/a/v9sT5) . (my computer's hard drive was wiped some time ago). In Hindsight, I should have taken a picture of them every day.

Ooccoo and Anser, I think about you all the time. Even if there's nothing beyond death, you live on in my memories and through this story. 

Thank you for reading, friends.

TL;DR: I had two ducks- whom I loved very much. They died and showed themselves to me in a dream before they left, letting me know about their injuries (which I had no knowledge of), and delivering a message about the importance of unconditional love.

EDIT, A FEW MORE THINGS, ALSO IN COMMENTS:

Another detail I just remembered. After a week I finally muster enough strength to go outside and clean their pen so we can tare it down. Inside the pen were two mourning doves. I entered the pen and they tried flying out. One exited the pen immediately and the other landed at my feet. I approach it and IT ALLOWED ME TO PICK IT UP. I had it perched on my hand as I walked out of the pen, waiting it to leave of it's own volition. Well, it stayed there for a good 3 or 4 minutes....just looking at me. Then, it flew off. In the pen, I find two feathers. just two. [I took this picture just now of them](http://i.imgur.com/KzM1CGS.jpg) .  I would have kept as many as I could find if there were more...One from Ooccoo, and one from Anser. I'm 22 now, and to this day I keep them in my keepsake box, and when I'm ever really sad or depressed, I take the feathers out, and hold them in my hands while I stroke them.

ANOTHER NEAT SEMI-RELATED THING THAT I WANTED TO SHARE, WHILE I'M HERE:

Haha, well, since I pulled out those feathers for you guys I decided to rummage through my keepsake box which I hadn't done in probably a year. 

My dad tells me, on probably a weekly basis, that I have always had a really strange connection with animals which he's never seen. Almost a supernatural connection. [I made friends with this little red squirrel a few days after I moved up north](http://imgur.com/rYCjeQP) (he is a WILD squirrel by the way). I named him Conker, and he still comes when I call his name.

Well, when I was just a wee child, my dad sat next to Jane Goodall herself while he was on a plane for a business trip. He talked to her the whole time, and has told me that she was/is just about the sweetest and most articulate lady in the world. He told her about my connection with animas and he pulls out a wallet picture of me. Jane Goodall signed my picture without my dad prompting her, [and I just found it again in my keepsake box](http://imgur.com/pLVOEOD) . 

It's really old, so a little difficult to read by the picture:

To (my name)-

I hope you will help me and help animals. We need you.

Jane Goodall.

And we need you too, (brother's name). 

[J.G. Institute: Box 599, Ridgefield CT, 06877]

I don't know if that address is still good, I'm about to look it up, but often times I wonder if I should write to her and show her this picture! I thought you'd all think it was kind of cool. 


Again, thank you for letting me share that.

I was hanging out with my cousin, his girlfriend (Kelly), and her sister. We were playing the Call of Cthulu tabletop game which got us on the topic of the paranormal. Kelly and her sister mention a tape they have of Kelly talking to something or someone. I'm instantly interested and ask about it. Kelly's sister gets up and walks back to her room to find the tape. In the meantime Kelly explains that her and her sisters had this tape recorder growing up. They would record themselves singing and , while playing hide and seek, whoever was hiding would record messages for them to listen to later. Her sister returns with a tape recorder and begins fast forwarding through the tape inside of it. She stops on the end of a recording of the sisters singing. That recording ends then a new one begins. It begins with what sounds like a fan running. The voice that speaks sent chills down my spine and still does as I think about it right now. It sounds like it should be a man but the voice is too deep to be human. He speaks garbled words in a slow tongue. Then a child says ""Hi, I'm Kelly. I'm 5 years old."" Kelly speaks a bit more but she is hard to understand. She ends with ""What's your name?"" The voice replies with more slow, garbled words. Then it speaks the only words I could understand. ""Can you sing me a song."" Then Kelly sings. She sings some old lullaby. One that is familiar but I can't quite remember it. Then the voice sings with her. Just for a few seconds the deep, slurred voice follows her lead in the song.

Then the recording ends.

My friends suggested I post this on /r/Paranormal[1] since it has kind of become a campfire tale of mine, but I figured I post it here as well. It is a short read, sorry that I don't really have any answers.

So this was about 13 years ago, when I was about 6 or 7. There is really no date, don't think it matters much though. All I know is that this story was from before my parents got a divorce.

Let me explain the layout of the rooms in the story that matter real quick. My room as at the top left corner and my bed is against the right wall. The room is connected to the hallway by the door near the end of the bed. Right across from my room is the kitchen, and in the kitchen my dad was making some popcorn before he and my mom popped in some movies. If this adds any depth or theories to the story, the house was actually where the fire fighters used to live. It is directly across the street from the fire department.

""Nothing was really off about the night, we hadn't even watched any horror movies,"" he had told me.

He threw in the homestyle popcorn my mom really loved and was sitting there.

""I heard something from your room, I think it was just a noise from the attic,"" he says.

My dad went to check it out and he says he saw something that totally freaked him out.

""I wasn't on drugs, I swear, that was when I was when I was already clean a few years.""

What he saw at the end of my bed was a little girl in a black gown, sitting in a playful position, staring at me with her arms crossed. She turned around, looked at him and then went back to staring at me.

""Holy shit, Ryan, I ran and got your mom. When we both went back she was gone, we didn't let you sleep in there. We brought you into the living room and you fell asleep with us later that night, well I didn't sleep much.""

So that is what most people think is the end of the story, though it continues into the next few days.

It rained pretty hard that day, exceptionally hard. Though it wasn't anything strange, we were living in a coastal town, sometimes the ocean threw nasty little storms at you.

Well that night, they didn't let me sleep in there again. Everyone went to sleep relatively early. When we woke up there was an odd smell. My dad got up and walked to the bathroom, figuring someone didn't flush. On the way there he looked in my room...

I turned on the TV and decided to change the channel, we had digital TV at the time so I went to the menu that displays all the shows that are on TV right now, and the shows that will come on later. While browsing through the channel I happen to catch a glimpse of the time, and it was around 9:00 am or later, so I decided to look out the window to see if my Grandmothers car was there, as it seemed a little odd that she'd be going to work so late.

I looked out the window and much to my terror, there was no car in the drive way, my Gran had been gone the whole time. The instant I realized she wasn't home, the water stopped running.

In the late 80's we moved to a town house. It was a major upgrade from living in my Aunt's garage. We were very poor and my parents both struggled but never failed to provide for us.

I remember that at the time there was a ""skeleton man"" that would come out every night and would glide a long the wall and up to the ceiling and out the locked bedroom door. Looking back I have no logical way to explain it. Whatever it was appeared to be flat one dimensional skeleton that glowed. The window of the ranch house we lived at faced the backyard which was surrounded by heavy forest. No car lights had any means of shining into the window. I remember crying every time I'd see it and yell for Mom until she would unlock the door and open it. That would make the ""skeleton man"" disappear. It may have been just a conjured image in my three year old brain but I still remember it. It wasn't a scary thing to me, I was actually mad at it for trying to leave the bedroom when it was bed time and we couldn't.

 When we moved into the town house it was a new start for us. I was four and I hated change. I even protested when we got new beds. God I must have annoyed the hell out of my parents. I was a stickler to old things and hated letting anything go. During that time I remember I would see things out of the corner of my eye. Quickly I would turn to look and nothing would be there. The most common thing I would see was a boy in a suit, kind of like the 1970's style with a bowl cut and dark hair. There would sometimes be a man too. They always appeared to be black and white like in the old time movies and TV shows. I went to my Mom and told her what I had been seeing and she flat out told me there was nothing there and to ignore it. During my childhood there was rarely ever anything truly paranormal. There would be the occasional bump in the night, the whisper of my name when I was home alone, nothing all too memorable. I went to my Mom too about the whispers and she responded ""Don't ever answer back. Don't talk to it."" Which confused me even more but being that my Mom told me not to talk to whatever it was I obeyed.

 It all exploded when I turned thirteen. A lot of things in my family's lives were changing. My oldest sister Rebecca was sixteen and my younger sister Trish was twelve. My younger brother Bryan was turning ten. My parents had better jobs, my Mom got her high school diploma and bachelors in nursing and money started flowing in. It was the first time we ever got a microwave. Things seemed to be sky rocketing up until the drinking started. Mom began to drink on the weekends which evolved into every few days into every day. The drinks went from Mike's Hard Lemonades to full blown Jack Daniel's and squirt soda. She declared it was her right to drink because she was working so hard and life went into a tail spin. The house stunk of negativity. When my Mom drank she hated everyone. Her tongue was venomous and it would turn from mental and emotional abuse to physical. My Dad took the brunt of the physical but there were times I would try my damnedest to avoid her but she'd grab with her strong thin fingers and rip your hair out or slap you until you saw stars. It was absolutely miserable time for us. What inkling of paranormal activity there was in the old town house erupted into something indescribable.

 My first memory of whatever it was that came in was the tapping. We lived in this house for years so we knew of the sounds that the building would emit. This tapping was like someone taking their finger nail and striking it against a wall. Very sharp taps. Rebecca and I stood in the hallway between rooms at one point and listened with all the bedroom doors open as the tapping was happening in her room. I said ""Stop it!"" and it stopped immediately. We stared at each other in shock as moments passed and suddenly the tapping resumed in my room. Rebecca yelled at it to stop and it finally did.

 My bedroom had the crawl space door in it and nothing ever happened that was strange before then. At one time I was sitting in my bedroom drawing when it sounded like someone reared their fist back and punched my closet door from the inside. It was a metal door and the sound was very loud. I had my back to the door and I just felt all the hair rise from my neck and I rose to my feet and quickly left my room. An hour later I returned and with all the bravery I could muster opened my closet door. Nothing was misplaced nothing had fallen. The crawl space door wasn't moved. There would be loud crashing like someone took one of our box fans and threw it to the ground, assuming it was one of our many cats I would go and look and nothing would be out of place and no cats would be insight. This old town house had squeaky floors so you could hear someone walking up and down the stairs and around the second floor. There would be times when I would be home alone and I would hear someone walking from my parents room down the hall and into my bedroom. My door was always closed and I would never hear it open. One day I came home from school and Rebecca and Bryan had been home all day sick. They told me they were hanging out watching TV when they heard the same thing but then it sounded like multiple people were walking around in my bedroom. They were too frightened to see if it was anyone. The steps always had a physical weight to them unlike the ginger movements of one of our cats.

 At night I would try to go to bed and in the darkness it just felt like I was being watched. My siblings felt the same way too. It was impossible to sleep on my back because it just felt like there was something hovering in the darkness. I'm a very skeptical person and I would try to explain to myself what these sensations must be but I could never just rationally solve it. There would sometimes be phantom water droplets that would land on my face in the night. It felt like icy cold water and I would go and wipe my face and nothing would be there. At one point I was sitting on my bed with my back to my closet door and it felt like one of the cats jumped onto my bed with a lot of weight. I looked behind me and there was nothing there. It actually made me bounce up from where I was sitting. I quickly left my room when that happened. The only time I could ever get a restful nights sleep was keeping my light on and turning on my TV which was one of those big glass console ones. There was a hum it gave off that just seemed to drown out these unsettling feelings. It's hard to explain. One of the things I hated the most was the breathing. Before I finally decided to sleep with my light on and TV there were nights I would think I would hear someone breathing in my room. I would hold my breath and think, 'Okay, this is your brain being tired, You're hearing things.' But there would be a long deep breath coming from some where in the room. I would spring up and run to my little sister's room and sleep there.

 Things started to get moved around in the house. Objects would disappear and reappear hours later. Keys, the remote, little trinkets. One time my Mom drunkenly couldn't find her nail clippers and she dragged me out of bed and started kicking me screaming at me to give it back. Rage ticked off in my brain and I'm ashamed to say it but I swung me fist up and punched her in the eye to stop her. It was the first and only time I ever struck my Mom and I'm still embarrassed of it. My Dad rushed into the room as my Mom stumbled back and he wrapped her arms around her pulling her out of the room as she screamed ""You're fucking out of her you lazy bitch! I'm calling the police! Pack your shit and get the fuck out of MY HOUSE!"" My Dad managed to calm her enough to get her to go to bed and the next morning I waited to get evicted out at the age of fifteen. My Mom didn't speak to me at all that morning and her right eye had a thin purple and red bruise by the corner. The most extreme thing I've ever experienced of something being moved was my cat Beowulf. He was a content fat orange tabby who was the quintessential lap cat. One day I was typing away on a paper for school. Beowulf did a figure eight around my legs and walked into the kitchen to eat. Moments later I heard a loud crashing at the front door. Quickly I got up and walked over and opened it to reveal Beowulf wedged between the front door and screen door. My brain wtf'ed for a moment and I looked at the screen door. There was no rational explanation for this cat to have gotten between these two locked doors.

 One morning my sister Rebecca's screams woke me up. Trish and I ran to her room to find she had kicked off her blankets and she was in an absolute state of panic. From mid thigh down to her ankles it looked like someone had taken their finger tips and trailed blood down her legs. It wasn't simply a blood trail it looked like smeared blood from God knows where. She had no cuts or anything on her. Around this time we started to see things out of the corners of our eyes. They were always men but they looked the same black and white like that boy etc. It was unsettling and the noises and whispers escalated. At this time whenever we would open our front door we would see out of our peripheral something shoot out from the house. It looked like a translucent orange guinea pig thing with black strips. My Dad is a hardcore skeptic and atheist and he even saw it too. If you have cats that are indoor/outdoor you'd understand that whenever you open any door leading outside you keep a look out for any cats.

 The atmosphere of the house was oppressive. It was like you were swimming in molasses when you walked through the door. Stupidly one day Trish decided to bring a friend over with an Ouija board. They tinkered around with it until they both started feeling sick. I came into the room and scolded them and suddenly it felt like something latched itself to my arms with a great deal of weight. I felt my shoulders pop and sink and lifting my hands was painfully difficult like something was holding on and trying to drag me down. Quickly we disposed of the Ouija board and the same idiot friend who brought the board burned sage and I felt relief from the weight on my arms. At that point I had enough and finally decided to talk to my Mom about what was going on. I caught her one day just coming home from work and I asked her what to do. She explained to us to not fear it. To tell it to leave because it had no choice but to if you demanded it. Fearing it gave it power.

 It was hard to not be afraid so I unattached myself from the situation. I ignored the tapping, the whispers, the touches. My sisters and brother did the same. Bryan never really experienced anything other than occasionally seeing a shadow and when he would film himself with an old video camera you would sometimes see orbs float about him. I can't really say those were ghosts but they didn't appear any where else on the videos other than his room. It probably was dust because he was a typical teen age boy with a dirty room. We continued to ignore the strange activities as best we could and suddenly my Dad left. He packed his bags when we were at school. He couldn't take my Mom's drinking and abuse anymore. My Mom was devastated. She cried and cried and became destructively drunk at night. She would watch sad romantic movies over and over on max volume. It was very embarrassing to come home from hanging with friends and hear yet again the same movie being played to death from several houses away. My brother and I ended up keying the the DVD's that she would play to death. I know it's pretty shitty but we didn't know what else to do. We would try to talk to her and she would blame us.

 Something inside her changed soon after. It was the first day she came home without a bottle of Jack Daniels (she would go through a bottle in less than three days). Her mood seemed brighter and she insisted on taking us to Blockbuster to rent movies, movies we liked. She sat us down and explained she was going to quit drinking. I finally felt comfortable enough to fully talk to her about the things going on in the house and she told me a story from when she was a young girl. It was the same ranch house that we had lived in before. When she was about nine years old she felt very thirsty and got up to get a drink from the kitchen. Stepping into the kitchen she turned on the light and saw something absolutely terrible. It was something you see and quickly close your eyes but it still burned into her brain. An elderly woman was standing in the center of the kitchen. Her grey hair was matted down and stringy and her white night gown was torn and soiled and wet. Her face was blackened and swollen and her right arm was dangling from a thread of skin. When my Mom opened her eyes she saw nothing. Panic flooded her and she fled to her bedroom and hid under the covers. The rest of the night she swore she heard someone slowly walking around the house. Mom speculated that maybe it was a demon or something that followed my Grandpa home from the war. (He did recon in the Pacific in WWII and he witnessed and had to do a lot of bad things).

 The mood began to lighten in the house. Laughter began to fill it again. It had been almost five years without it. We felt like a family again and my Dad eventually came back. The strange occurrences lessened and when they did we would snap. ""Go away! You're not welcome here! Leave!"" Cats weren't being teleported anymore, no more phantoms walking around upstairs. One of the few things that happened occurred when I was doing a project involving recording audio books for blind kids. I laid across my floor using a tape recorder occasionally rewinding and listening to what I read to make sure it was perfect. One of the times I was listening and I was talking away a loud grunting started to come over the audio. I rewound and listened again. It was there and it was louder than me reading. These were fresh tapes and I didn't know how to explain it. Unnerved and not wanting to give anything an inch to make me scared I recorded over it. That wasn't the last time I experienced something in the town house.

 I was doing chores one day listening to my portable CD player and doing dishes in the kitchen. I was in my own little world when out of the corner of my eye I saw a man crouched five feet away from me in front of the fridge. He looked black and white much like the others, I remember he was wearing a long coat that was splayed out around him. He wore one of those old tweed hats and his nose was very long. I turned my head to towards whatever it was and suddenly in an instant his face was in my face, his eye was against my eye. It looked like a goats eye. I screamed loudly and winced trying to protect my head from whatever attack was happening but when I opened my eyes nothing was there. That would be the last time for several years anything paranormal to that extent happened to me in that house.

 A few years later, Bryan and myself were skimming through old family videos from that time. Randomly we both started getting really bad headaches. Sickness hit us and we had to turn off the VCR. I'm not sure if there was an imprint left on the tape of all the negativity but it sure felt like it. We felt better after we tossed the tapes back in the bag they were in and leaving the room.

 Please forgive my writing style, I love this subreddit and I've always wanted to share my experiences with you guys. I'm a very skeptical person, the kind that doesn't believe it until I experience it but I do believe in ghosts now. I wonder if all of it happened because of the negativity my family was giving off and those things were feeding from it and perpetuating it. Thank you for taking to time to read this.

I just found this subreddit with Random, and after looking through it, I thought I'd post my story.  Sorry if it's too long, but I'm a bit wordy, and I think the background is important.  Feel free to tl;dr.

**[WARNING: WALL OF TEXT]**

When I was ten, I went to a Christian summer camp.  It was a pretty great place, with lots of hiking mixed with some Bible study and campfires; maybe not everyone's idea of a good time, but I loved it.  Anyway, we had a very loud, obnoxious camp counselor who was always trying to force his version of Christianity on us.  Whenever we'd ask a question, he'd give us a ten minute theological lecture and two or three personal anecdotes.  One night, as we were going to sleep, he told us one of his stories.  

Apparently, he and his friends were at a camp like ours once, and they didn't care for their pastor.  He was cut from the old-school, fire-and-brimstone mold, and he was always warning them about Hell and the temptations of Satan.  After one particularly furious sermon, they went back to their tent pretty annoyed with having to sit through such a ridiculous rant.  They started to make fun of the pastor, and eventually one of them yelled out for Satan to show himself if he were there.  Our counselor said the air started to chill, and the wind started to pick up.  Then, their tent shook, softly at first, then like it was in a hurricane.  They all started screaming, and our counselor got on his knees and prayed for deliverance.  The storm subsided, the air grew warmer, and they all did their best to go to sleep.

Now, I've always been a fairly skeptical person, and even at ten this story sounded like bullshit.  It just seemed too carefully constructed, too applicable to us; it seemed more like an object lesson than a real story.  I should also mention that I was having a lot of problems with Christianity itself at the time.  It was nothing deep or philosophical--I was ten after all--but I just couldn't connect with the church or the people in it.  So, for several reasons, I didn't believe the story.  But I couldn't let it rest like that; I had to prove to myself that it wasn't real.  So, after the counselors were asleep, I snuck out of our building and walked into the woods.  The camp's security obviously could have used some work.

I walked through the woods a little ways until I found a clearing, which seemed a good a place as any.  And I just started yelling.  Not really loudly, so as not to wake anyone, but as loud as I thought I could get away with.  Stuff like ""So where are you, Satan?"" and such.  It sounds stupid, and it was, but I really wanted to show myself that the story was fake; in retrospect, I'm not sure why I needed that so much.

So, for the first few minutes of this, nothing happened.  Then, I just yelled for something to come out and show itself, basically copying what my counselor had said.  Just a few seconds after the words came out of my mouth, I felt the air change.  I cannot explain it to you easily.  It was cold, *very* cold, but it also felt like my body was electrified; I could feel a tingling on my skin.  I can still feel it.  The wind didn't pick up like in my counselor's story.  Quite the opposite: what small breezes there had been stopped completely, and everything was perfectly still and silent.  Then, I saw it.

It was a man, or at least it looked like a man.  His face was extremely pale, so pale that it shone out against all the darkness.  He was taller than me and thin, but not abnormally so.  He looked at me for a few seconds, and then he smiled.  I cannot begin to describe to you that smile other than to say that it was the stuff of nightmares.  I think C.S. Lewis must have had a similar experience in his life, because this quote from his (fictional) book *Perelandra* says it better than I ever could:

""It looked at Ransom in silence and at last began to smile. We have all often spoken—Ransom himself had often spoken of a devilish smile.  Now he realised that he had never taken the words seriously. The
smile was not bitter, nor raging, nor, in an ordinary sense, sinister; it was not even mocking. It seemed to summon Ransom, with a horrible naiveté of welcome, into the world of its own pleasures, as if all men
were at one in those pleasures, as if they were the most natural thing in the world and no dispute could ever have occurred about them. It was not furtive, nor ashamed, it had nothing of the conspirator in it. It did not defy goodness, it ignored it to the point of annihilation.  Ransom perceived that he had never before seen anything but half-hearted and uneasy attempts at evil. This creature was whole-hearted. The extremity of its evil had passed beyond all struggle into some state which bore a horrible similarity to innocence""

That is it.  It looked as pure in its evil as I suppose the angels look in their goodness.  Like it had never once given a thought to anything good or kind or wholesome.  I cannot tell you how terrible it is to look into the eyes of something like that.

I ran.  I think I screamed, but I must not have, because I didn't wake anyone up; maybe I was in too much shock to scream.  I just kept thinking--praying, I guess--for someone, anyone to save me from that thing in the woods.  I made it back into our building, waking a few fellow campers on the way, but I went straight to my bed and under the covers.  I kept praying and praying, for hours, and I suppose they were heard, because the thing never came for me.

So that's my experience.  I've only talked about it with my parents and three close friends before now.  I've since come back to Christianity on my own terms, and I thank God every day for saving me, as I am absolutely certain He did.  Even now, though, at 22, I am afraid of the dark.  It's hard for me to look into mirrors sometimes, because I'm afraid that I will see that face again.  I can't watch any horror movies with demons in them; I literally had to walk out of *Paranormal Activity 2* after my friends cajoled me into going.  I cannot abide silence.  Basically, the experience has affected me ever since, and I don't know how to let it go.  If anyone with similar experiences can offer me any advice, I would be immeasurably grateful.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_lbkfb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/lbkfb/me_when_i_was_10_i_met_a_demon_in_the_woods/,

First let me say that I'm a female in my mid 20s. By all means I'm a normal person with a normal life for people of my demographic. I have never been diagnosed with any mental disorder, never had any mental problems besides occasional boughts of depression that aren't intense, and I'm not on medication.

This happened about 3 months ago and I want people's honest opinions.

It was about 7pm one Saturday and my roommate wanted me to go to the mall and then out to get a drink with her with some other friends. I wanted a nap so I told her I'd skip the mall and meet her at them at the bar at 9pm. I had not had anything to drink at that point in at least a week and a half, so what happened to me had nothing to do with alcohol.

My roommate left for the mall and I laid down to take my nap. I left the kitchen light on so my room wasn't totally dark. I fell asleep and woke up to the sight of my alarm clock showing it was 8:45. Immediately I thought my roommate was already back because besides my alarm clock it was completely dark which lead me to believe she turned the kitchen light out. At this point I was still very groggy, but my eyes were open and I was laying in the same spot.

Here's where it gets weird... All of a sudden out of nowhere an ink black ""shadow"" came out of my wall, swirled in front of me in mid air, and went under my bed. This was NOT sleep paralysis because I moved.. When I saw this I immediately jumped up and ran into the living room. I felt an overwhelming sense of fear and a presence at my front door that didn't allow me to leave. I turned back towards my bedroom and standing right in front of me was a classic ""grey alien"" in a black cloak. 

Before going into the rest of the story I will describe this thing's appearance. It was about 5'9 and of human stature. It's cloak covered up it's entire body besides the head. It's face alone was horrifying... very small slit for a mouth, no ears, grey skin. But the eyes... the eyes were scarier than anything I've ever seen. They were the classic big black eyes, but the appearance alone wasn't what was the worst: It was it's expression. It looked at me as if it had a deep disdain and hatred for all human beings and everything we are. 

I was so deeply afraid and shaken that I couldn't cry. I asked who it was and it communicated the name ""Satan"" in a very condescending way. It didn't speak, it was like telecommunication. At that moment I went into ""fight or flight"" and tackled the thing to the ground. 

The next thing I remember I woke up on the floor in that very spot and all the lights were on. The clock said 9:50, so I definitely had some missing time.

I have no idea what happened... Nothing like this has ever happened to me before and I am not a schitzophrenic. 

Has anyone had any experience like this? I just can't believe it was a dream... I've had lucid dreams before and this seemed absolutely real.

In the living room of their home at the time of this incident, the family had a picture of the boy's grandfather, who had died years before the boy was born.  Still, the boy knew the face, just not who the man in the picture was.  

One day, while his father was upstairs in his office, the boy, 4 or 5 at the time, was outside playing by the family's in-ground pool.  The father was unaware, until he heard a splash.  He panicked and sprinted downstairs, and just as he was about to step into the backyard, he heard the splashing stop.  Horrified, he feared the worst.  But when he got outside, there was his son, completely drenched, but unharmed.  He grabbed the boy and asked him what had happened.  Without hesitating, and in a very calm voice, the boy responded, ""I fell in the water, but the man on top of the TV saved me.""

     The very first ghost encounter I had was when I was only 5-6 yrs old.  I am the youngest of five children so as you can imagine I got picked on a little bit, nothing cruel or mean but just teased and messed with.  Well it was just an average ordinary night in Indiana...my brother who is only two years older than me (7-8 at the time) thought it would be funny to take my shoe away from me and run with it.
I chased him down screaming ""give me back my shoe!"" and he just laughed and laughed as he ran to the back of the house.  He then got to the end of the hallway and he had nowhere to run, so he threw it into my oldest brothers room. (at this point, no one was in my oldest brothers room. It was pitch black because it was night and no lights were on.) SO...once the shoe left his hands and into the room, it came flying out as if it was a vortex...it wasnt even as if someone caught it and threw it back...it was like it never stopped moving and just came right back at him and nailed him directly in the face. Now of course this makes absolutely no sense at all, but I loved the fact that he got hurt and just started laughing really hard. No clue how this happened but that is the first ""paranormal"" incident that happened to me personally.
   At this point it really isnt anything terrifying, just strange. Later on as I grew older in this house, we realized just how cruel and perhaps evil the spirits were. Seems like something directly out of a movie.  If you guys want to hear more stories let me know....gotta get back to work.

also let me know if you have any idea what could have caused this or had any similar experiences. thanks!

TL;DR Im 5 years old, brother is 7. He stole my shoe and threw it into my oldest brothers pitch black bedroom which nobody was currently in. It came flying out of the room and hit him directly in the face.

This starts to sound like something I would call out as being fake around the end. I promise it's not though. Please downvote if you don't believe me though. Also, very sorry this isn't very eloquent. But I'm not hear to try to make it sound pretty like I'm telling you a story. It's just a log of sorts detailing my experiences with this house.

Back in May 2010 (or '11. I don't quite remember. Oops.), My mom, a friend and I went to Savannah, GA for a week long vacation. I had a kidney infection at the time (relevant), but I'd be damned if we cancelled that stupid vacation. 
For those not too familiar with the city, let me fill you in: It was voted the most haunted city in America back in 2002, and it's still pretty damn haunted. It was quite literally built on it's dead. This city honestly and truly becomes a different place at night. It really feels like some sort of veil has been lifted. So naturally, we went on a ghost tour our second night there. It was kitschy and campy and spooky and fun until we went to this particular house. The tour guide told us (I assumed he was trying to freak us out) that if you felt like you couldn't approach the house, then don't. sit at the park bench over there and we'll pick you up. He wasn't joking. You knew this house the minute it came into site. It was terrible. I mean I really can't emphasize how horrible this place is. 

to beging with, here are the legends surrounding the house for background. Note, I'm doing a lot of summarizing and copy pasting from [This site](http://www.bethdolgner.com/432abercorn/the-legend-of-432-abercorn/). This Lady heard a lot of the same stuff we did. It's a lot to type out, and this Lady has already done it much more eloquently and detailed than I could do it, so credit where it's due. However, there are some bits of history I got that she didn't know/include, so a lot of this stuff is straight from me.


The first death was that of a little girl in the late 1800's. She died due to a neglectful father, a former civil war General, who punished her by forcing her to sit in front of a window for days until she died of dehydration. He died years later of natural causes. But he and his daughter apparently remain. Our first two ghosts. (check out the above link for more details on this one)

The next deaths were in 1959. 
&gt; a family ... came to visit the doctor and his family living at [The house]. The visiting family included four daughters, ranging in age from four to twelve. The adults went out one evening, and when they returned later they found three of the girls dead. Two of them were still inside the house, and one was sprawled on the front porch, as if she was slain while trying to escape. The youngest daughter, age four, was the only one still alive. The sad and senseless triple murder was never solved.

Not included on the site above is this bit, and probably most important I think. In the late 80's, the house was rented out to a lot from California. The turned the place into a branch of the Church of Satan. Being in the deep, dark, bible thumpin' south, they were quickly chased out of town. This is, apparently, when shit got real. We move onto the next bit. 

&gt; In the 1990s, the house was briefly rented out and a lot of college students from nearby Savannah College of Art and Design lived there. They heard pounding, heavy pacing, crying and, even more mysterious, a lot of giggling. I spoke to a local resident who sometimes feels such a negative emotion emanating from the house that she can’t even walk past it. One of her acquaintances lived at the house for a time, **but he disappeared while living there**, and the mysterious circumstances make her wonder if his disappearance is somehow related to the paranormal activity at the house.

Now shit hits the fan. Our tour guide was a close friend of this missing young man. Apparently, he experienced much more than giggling. He apparently saw some crazy shit. Including black masses, large dogs with red eyes, and an evil looking old dude in his room (I think I caught a pic of this old man. Will be in pics at the bottom). As stated above, the young man disappeared. Our tour guide also seemed to think it was related to the house.

The last bit to happen here was in the early 00's. A young family moved in, and moved out by that evening. They seem to have experienced just about everything mentioned above in the 12 or so hours they were there. Their stuff is still in the house (again, more pics below). Since then, the woman who owns the house refuses to rent it out. She believes anyone who lives there will come to be harmed.

So, now onto what I experienced there.

When you first start looking at the house, the first thing you notice is that **you are being watched.** This house feels like it's alive, and covered in eyes. Even more unsettling, is that you *know* when ever you looked into a window, or through the gate to the back yard, you were looking at something. You just couldn't see it simply because *it just didn't want you to see it.* There was always something there, just beyond site. To me, that's one of the scariest things about this house.

After a few minutes, the cold set in. It's the dead of summer in Georgia, and *it's cold.* I figured it was probably just a breeze, until I noticed how still everything was. The leaves weren't rustling or making a sound at all. it was a perfectly still night. The cold didn't let up until we left the house.

After we got the background on the house, we were free to wonder around it as long as we didn't go in. Some people were brave enough to go the the front door and take pictured through the mail slot. That was a terrible feeling. It felt like the house was trying to suck you in through that tiny mail slot. I could only handle so much, and handed my camera to a guy on the tour (there's a strange amount of trust between people on ghost tours) so he could take some shots with it. I went across the street and watched. He took a few more pictures through the mail slot, and you could see it illuminate the inside of the lower floor. On the third or fourth shot, however, it was different. The entire interior of the house lit up red. Only briefly, just as long as the flash. Every one saw it, and they guy decided he had had enough picture taking for the night. Our group moved on. 

But something about that house fucked with me. I didn't want to be near it. I knew if I was to stay so close to it for the remainder of the week, it would some how hurt me. I used the kidney infection as an excuse to leave the next day.

But here's where the house really starts to scare me, even now (and sorry if this starts sounding like a pasta. I swear it's not). Sometimes, I'm overwhelmed with the urge to just jump in my car and make that hours long drive to Savannah just so I can see that house. It's not like it's ""calling to me"" or anything, as much as for some reason, I have this terrible fascination with it. I wouldn't say I'm obsessed with it, but once I start thinking or talking about it, I'm stuck on it for a few days. I just want to know more about it. It apparently had this same affect on my mom and friend, but it seems to have teetered off over tie with them with them.

Even sitting here now, typing about it and looking at the pictures, I feel physically ill. I feel completely afraid of that house.

Some say that children see the world much differently than adults, peeling back the veil with their young eyes.  I was in the 5th grade and my mother often played cards every Thursday evening with a group of older ladies she had met while working as a waitress at a local family owned diner.  The game was always held at an older womans house by the name of Alice, a ranch style home on the outskirts of Detroit, built during or shortly after WW2.

This evening was no different than the other times I had been there, I would watch tv in a small family room right next to the kitchen.  Given that there was no wall separating the kitchen from the family room I could see them playing their game at the table.  Now Alice kept her house oddly dark, the only lights on was the light over the kitchen table and a small lamp in the family room.  The place gave me the creeps and I would never venture off alone but this evening while watching ""Married with Children"" and having guzzled to many pops I was faced with a choice, stand there doing the pee-pee dance all night or man up and head through the kitchen and all the way down the long dark hallway to the bathroom at the other end of the house.

Gathering up my courage I headed through the kitchen and down the black hallway,finishing with my business I opened the door to leave.  If you were to turn left when you left the bathroom it took you further down the hall to extra bedrooms, storage areas and what not and I could see into the blackness as I stepped from the bathroom to head straight.  But when I stepped into the hallway I froze, every hair on my body stood up and I stood there frozen in terror.  I dared not move my head to look but I could see out of my peripheral as a shadow stepped from one of the bedrooms to my left.  It was short, hunched over and not much taller than I was.  It stood there in the hallway facing the wall but with its head turned towards me.  I could do nothing but stand there with a stupid look on my face, I could feel whatever it was eying me as if it were shocked that I could see it, as if it were thinking ""What the hell"" and when it came to the realization that I could see whatever it was the shadow quickly turned its back to me and glided the rest of the way down the hallway and disappeared into a bedroom at the end of the hall.  I didn't ask questions nor did I pretend to be brave, I ran....I ran like the scared little hobbit I was.  Whatever this thing was Alice lived alone with this thing in her home, maybe she couldn't see it but I sure as hell could.  I snatched the keys from my moms purse and went and sat in the car until she was finished, she could see the terror on my face and did not ask questions.  I later explained to her what I saw, she never forced me to go with her after that.  I have several other stories to share and I look forward to posting them here.

I am a skeptic, but can not explain what I saw that night.

When I was younger, my brother and I shared a bunk bed in my room.  The room was right above the front door, so I could see it clearly from my bed.

One night, I woke up feeling like something wasn't right.  I was paranoid to begin with, often placing pillows against the window in fear of someone looking in as I slept.  As I looked outside, a cold shiver ran down my spine.

Outside my window, in the grass leading to my front door, stood a towering blueish creature, slowly making its way towards the door.  I can not explain it as anything other than a monster.  Tall, wide shouldered and terrifying. It almost looked like it had some kind of fur, though it was hard to tell.  

I stared at the creature in pure terror for a few seconds before it turned its head and looked right at me.  I tried to scream as loud as I could.  I tried and tried, but I couldn't make a noise. I was beyond terrified.  I was paralyzed.

All I could think was that the creature saw me and was now coming into the house to get me.  I remember thinking that if I made it through the night, I'd have to scan the yard for foot prints the next morning.  I knew what I saw and I was determined to prove it to people.  Somehow, I eventually fell asleep.

The next morning, I instantly went outside looking for foot prints.  Finding nothing, I tried to convince myself that it was just another nightmare.  An extremely realistic nightmare, mind you, but a nightmare none the less.  

Then my brother approached me about a nightmare he had the night before.  He saw a large bluiesh-purple creature outside the front door.  He tried to scream for my mom, but couldn't make a noise.  As he told his story, my blood froze.  I told him about my ""nightmare"" and we both shit bricks.  I still have no explanation.

tl;dr  My brother and I were both scared shitless by a giant blue creature.  ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_sy60t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/sy60t/the_monster_outside_my_windowmefam/,
1345539174.0,64,self.Thetruthishere,ykmf7,"I experienced a bizarre event while at a casino and it has taken me several weeks to get myself to write/ask/tell anyone about it. Reddit, can you please help me make sense of this? (x-post askreddit)",dudewheresmyreality,82,18,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ykmf7/i_experienced_a_bizarre_event_while_at_a_casino/,"Originally posted to [askreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ykj2y/i_experienced_a_bizarre_event_while_at_a_casino/) Was told it might be of interest here. Sorry in advance for the long read but I think it's necessary to have some background knowledge of my thought process prior to what I experienced)

I am a 24/m with no history of mental or physical illness that could possibly explain this. What I am about to share with you does not come easily for me in the least. Mostly because I already know trying to explain my experience is going to make me sound fucking crazy. But I'd much rather sound crazy anonymously to the internet than sound crazy to my close friends. I'm kind of worried about how they might react.

I'll get right to it and try to fill in any necessary details around it. Sorry if it's hard to follow. Bear with me, please.

We had been at the casino for three days now. Earlier that month we had stayed close to two weeks. Not sure why, but we got comped every night so what was initially supposed to be a two day trip ended up being much longer. I personally don't gamble that much, a couple hundred here and there. But by no means enough to warrant comping me three consecutive nights at this resort. Oh well, I'm not complaining.

During that first trip a friend of mine who does gamble a lot met a random guy ""Greg"" in the high-roller gaming area. I guess he was cool because my friends came to get me from the poker room to go meet this guy. He must've made quite an impression. Before I could cash out another random guy at the table, ""Chris"", overhears this conversation and cashes out before me and follows us to meet Greg. He wasn't exactly invited, but we've been at this casino for so long at this point and hung out with so many random people that we didn't think much of it. Sidenote: Greg pays for EVERYTHING that night. Taxi/alcohol/strippers

After we return home, both Greg and Chris text my friends and I repeatedly throughout the week asking/inquiring as to when we are coming back. They promise fun, strippers, and possible room accommodations. Chris even gives me the phone number to reserve a room and tells me how to go through the automated system to make it easier for me. All pretty friendly stuff.

And then I get this feeling... I'm usually not a paranoid person at all, but I got a weird feeling about these two guys. They are around 15-20 years older than us, they really want us to come back to the casino, and they seem to ALWAYS be there (Greg has been there close to a month at this point). I feed into this paranoia and come to the conclusion that one, if not both, of these guys is working undercover for the casino. I accept this far-fetched idea and think its ingenious that the casino has implemented undercover employees to mingle with their guests and subtly get us to play more games, and advertise various shops and restaurants to us without our immediate knowledge. I think it's quite clever and am convinced that if these aren't undercover employees then well, they should hire some because that is a fuckin great idea.

Now..comes the part where I lose you guys if I haven't already. I can't believe I'm even trying to explain this. On our return trip we managed to get ourselves a comped suite. Score! The first night we ran around slot-hopping, where something strange happened too, but I'll get into that later. The next day we bumped into Greg. Like I said.. this guy.. is always there. He then proceeds to arrange a hooker to come meet another friend of ours. Now I'm thinking... holy shit.. is this guy a pimp? or do I still think he's an undercover casino employee? or... both?! Doesn't matter.. Now we're at the blackjack table with Greg, two of my friends, and myself, while our other friend is getting busy with said hooker in the room.

And this is where the bizarre shit happens. We're all sitting there and all of a sudden I get really, really, cold. I start shivering uncontrollably, yet intermittently. I can't concentrate on conversations and for some reason can only hear select words. My mind is racing and then I am overcome with paranoia. I don't quite know what the hell is going on at this point, physically. It's here I start honing in on select cue words from Greg. He keeps saying ""ride it out"".. ""ride it out"".. ""Almost there"".. All while talking about blackjack but everything he says pertains to what I am thinking and freaking out about in my head. At times he directly comments on thoughts I am having in my head and even does hand gestures to illustrate my thoughts. Yeah.. I'm freaking out... but.. I know I'm sober. No alcohol or drugs prior to this event.. This doesn't make sense.

I am now becoming hypersensitive to everything around me. Conversations, strangers, pit bosses. The music playing over the speakers, though I know to be very mild, is now overbearing and a strange, very prominent, buzzing/pulsating sound is in my ears. The more I focus in on this sound and the more I allow it to ""break"" me down, the louder a voice becomes that says, ""He's getting close."" Whenever I hear that voice I pull away my focus from the pulsating sound and try my very best to look normal in front of everyone while I am secretly very fucking confused. So I try to relax.. the whole time I'm focusing on my breathing and trying to calm myself down.

Now this is going on in waves.. the pulsating... the buzzing.. the comments.. the shivering..the voice that says ""he's getting close"" everytime I feed into what I try to tell myself are hallucinations.. but.. why am I hallucinating while just sitting here in a casino?

Then what feels like a bug hits me in the back. It's the same feeling you'd expect if a fairly large beetle flew and landed on your back. I reach my hand over my shoulder and grab at the spot and immediately feel it. It's moving... but it's under my shirt. How the fuck did it get under my shirt? Whatever, I pinch my shirt around it and work it up to my collar to pop it out. I grab it with my fingers and it's squirming around in my fingertips and I freak out and drop it. I now grab the bottom of my shirt and do that flapping thing people do to get something out of their shirt. While I'm doing this I hear Greg say, ""There you go, now you can get in there."" I freeze, look at him... and instantly feel something crawling around my neck. I slap my hand to the back of neck, only to feel SOMETHING crawl INTO the back of my neck. Ummm...yeah.. if I was freaking out before... then well you could say this made me lose my shit.

Even during this unexplainable thing I was going through I still managed to have some sense of humor. I remember thinking to myself, ""Holy shit.. did ... did I just get matrixed?"" I think that little humorous thought was some sort of defense mechanism, cuz I'm pretty sure my brain was freaking out. I had thoughts of this being some sort of technology we aren't aware of yet. Technology to fuck with one person's senses while everyone else is normal. And technology to hack my brain. These were my thoughts man... I know.. it sounds crazy..

At some point immediately after this I saw a black blur quickly move from down the pathway by the slots, around the blackjack table and then directly behind me. VERY quickly. I looked over my right shoulder, nothing. Looked over my left, nothing. But I couldn't shake that feeling that someone was behind me. It's here that I heard Greg say something along the lines of, ""Go explore, it's your world now."" in a voice that was like he was disappointed. Maybe he was expecting a different result? Or maybe I wasn't supposed to be this aware of what was happening to me? Either way I felt something enter the back of my neck and just like that I felt like I was in a trance or some sort of hypnotic state. Although I've never been in one before, I imagine this is what it's like.

I don't really know much of what happened after the ""Go explore"" comment. But I remember having this overwhelming feeling that Greg was a part of this.. and even the casino itself was part of what was happening to me. The hooker eventually came back down and found us at the table. My friends got up and I followed them back to the room.

I was now terrified of being alone anywhere in this casino. My thoughts were noticeably more clear now that we left that table. It was only when I walked away that I noticed how clouded my thoughts and senses actually were. Very noticeably different.

Okay.. so now here I am. The days and weeks following this event have been filled with paranoia, losing sleep, and constantly rubbing that spot on the back of my neck trying to convince myself that it didn’t really happen. I notice movement specifically in shadows, daily. I also see something in my field of vision that I can guess is about the size of a fruitfly that appears, flys a small ""S"" curve, and disappears. Again, almost daily. It always happens very quickly and before I am able to focus in on it.

So, reddit. Tell me something. Tell me I'm crazy. Tell my to lay off the weed. I don't know. But what happened to me was not a drug induced hallucination. If so, then this drug has the ability to mess with temperatures, vision, hearing, and touch all while not giving off the impression of being a hallucination at any point. It’s all seamless and VERY real. These weren't warm colors, and geometric shapes melting and warping into loving hugs. This was a, ""I'm taking over your body and you can't do anything about it"" kind of experience.

I did some research on schizophrenia, you know... because the only way I can come to peace about this in a sane and rational way is to come to the conclusion that I may have just experienced my very first psychotic episode? That sounds almost laughably ironic.. but seriously.. I can't fucking explain this at all. Are there any people out there familiar with this that could provide me some insight? I’m serious… I haven’t spoken to my friends about this, I stay in almost everyday (though I may blame reddit for that), my whole demeanor, and personality, and possibly my perception of reality have changed because of this…

-------------------------------

My cousin recently moved here from Secunderabad, India. On a recent road trip exploring America, we were shootin shit and exchanging ghost stories and laughing at similarities and differences between American ghost stories and Indian ghost stories when I asked her if she's ever experienced anything supernatural. Her eyes widened as she averted her eyes to the window. Just when the silence was about to be too much for me, she softly responded ""Yes. A few. One is troubling.""

""When I was a second year in college, I stayed at in an all-girl hostel [dorm]. I made many friends. We were all very happy to be in school away from our conservative parents. The hostel was so much fun, but it was a very very old building. Electricity was only put in the rooms. Sometimes, candles were placed along the windows if a watchman was present, but normally once you left the rooms, you were faced with complete darkness.
It's common to wake up someone if you needed to walk down to the restroom at the end of the hall. We all had a childish fear of being alone in the dark. 

One night, I had to use the restroom. It was about 4am. I went to my friend's bed and tapped her on the arm. She immediately opened her eyes as soon as I touched her. I apologized for bothering her, and told her I needed to pee. She smiled at me and hopped out of bed. 
All the way down the hallway, she laughed and danced. I could not see her at all, but her bangles clanked together loudly and the bells on her anklets jingled softly. It was very calming.
I laughed and sashayed my hips down the hallway with her, too tired to match elaborate arm movements. She said nothing to me, though occasionally I heard her hum one of our favorite bollywood songs. The same thing happened on our return. I fell back asleep easily.

I awoke fairly late the next morning to the sound of men in our room. They surrounded her bed. I bolted from my bed, prepared to protect my friend, when I realized they were administrators of the college. I peered over closer. My friend's lifeless eyes were fixated on my bed; the same smile on her face. Suicide. Her time of death was 11:30pm, almost 5 hours before I woke her.""

We had gone to watch a friend's band play and were headed home from downtown Dallas (I don't live in the metroplex any longer, so not personal info).  It was around 1am but we still had ""plans"" before I was expected home (still dating at the time), so we headed to his apartment in one of the south Dallas suburbs.  This is a pretty well populated suburb but by the time we got close to his apartment the roads were pretty much empty.

We exited the highway and turned onto the street that led to his apartment. But as soon as we passed the traffic light under the highway, we both saw it, plain as day.  Stone sober and wide awake, we both saw a mother effing werewolf type creature exit a neighborhood street, and calmly run (in about 4 steps) across a 4 lane road.  It was about 75 yards in front of us.  But it wasn't exactly the way I'd imagine a werewolf.  It was completely canine... no human features at all except for the fact that it was on 2 legs.  The legs were massive and the thing was about 7 feet tall but the arms reminded me of t-rex arms.  They were small and still hung like dog legs.  They seemed very useless if the thing were trying to attack something.  The head was also odd.  Besides being a typical dog color (greyish black) the eyes were bright glowing yellow... even when there weren't headlights shining directly in them.  It didn't look like the glow an animal gets from lights in their eyes anyway.  But the thing that stood out to me the most was that the eyes were biocular, like a fish.  I saw the eyes clearly even though he was completely profile to us.  Here is a pic I drew.  I couldn't quite get it right, it was a little more menacing in the head and face than I could convey.  But I couldn't figure out how to draw it without making it look over the top and cartoonish.

http://imgur.com/dg66Gcu

I'll never forget how fast this thing was either.  Here is a diagram of what happened.

http://imgur.com/dAxdSnG

The road we were driving on had heavy trees to the right hand side of us.  When it came out, it was running but crossed this road in just a few steps.  It was big enough and effortlessly fast enough to know that a human couldn't have dressed up and done this.  There was an open field that he ran into.  When my husband and I got to where the trees broke, we both turned our heads to look but it was loooong gone by then (about 4 seconds).  I think the only thing that was said was a quiet ""What the fk"" by me.

More about what this thing looked like:  It was more menacing than my photo, but to be honest, much less scary than what I would imagine a werewolf to be.  When it was running across the road, I didn't get the sense that it cared that we saw it or that it was even trying that hard to cross before we got closer.  I didn't feel fear as if we were threatened, only a disbelief really.  And again, it's not like we were in a rural area by any stretch of the imagination.

When we passed the tree line, his apartment complex was literally another 150 yards or so up the road.  We hurried in and didn't exactly get to our ""plans.""  We basically just sat there in silence trying to rationalize I guess.  Still to this day I often think to myself, ""I mean really, did this really happen?!"" but as soon as I close my eyes and think about it, those bright yellow eyes are still there.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1eel47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1eel47/my_werewolf_sighting_mefampic/,

I found him emptying packets of pills into a bowl one night and took him over to our next door neighbours pool (they were away) for a swim hoping he would cheer up. I was only a kid, I figured that would work.

The next time he tried it I didn't catch him in time and had to call an ambulance. They got him to the hospital, made him drink charcoal then sent him to a mental health clinic where he was forced to stay for two weeks. My dad was pretty crafty, he talked his was out of it after a few days.

Things got worse and eventually mum decided she was going to leave him. He'd been acting strange, his depression seemed to be turning to desperation and had shown signs that he might harm us so we left the house to stay at a women's shelter.

Dad had family in another country so he travelled to his sisters house overseas to try and sort himself out on her advice. Two weeks later he hung himself from the railing on a staircase.

In the time between when he died and the funeral (maybe a week, we had to travel to where he was) I started having horrible dreams. I would be walking down a dirt road in forrest surrounded by trees and then I'd notice my dad off to the left wandering among them. I remember feeling surprised. Happy to see him again but also confused because he was dead but he wouldn't respond. He looked lost and very sad. He didn't seem to know that he was dead. His head hung low and he had sickly yellow looking skin. 

I remember thinking the dream was a way for me to cope, probably a pretty normal reaction for a kid who had just lost a parent to suicide.  

The morning of the funeral we saw his body. I'd never seen a dead body and it was horrible seeing my dad, my buddy, in an old suit lying in a coffin. He had red marks on his neck. His skin was that same horrible yellow colour. I will never forget how he looked.

Life carried on.

I grew up, moved away, started smoking pot, gave up pot, met a girl and started a career.

About 5 years later I was visiting my brother and his wife. My brother and I don't talk about my dad much, it's been a long time and I think we've discussed him maybe three or four times. That night, somewhat guided by his wife who probably thought it would be healthy for us to talk about it for once, we began sharing our memories of the days surrounding his death. I told them how I'd known with a certainty I can't describe that as I walked down our hallway and said goodbye to him before meeting my brother around the corner so we could drive to the women's refuge that I knew I would never see him again. I'd felt it in my bones.

My brother told me about a dream he had had after he'd been given the news. As he described it I felt the blood drain from my face. The same dirt road, the same forrest setting, my dad off to the left looking lost, skin yellow and head down. It wasn't until he was finished that I asked him for more detail and had him draw a rough picture. As far as I can tell he had a very similar dream to the one I had experienced during the time between his death and the funeral. The details were all there. He gave too detailed a description for it to be a coincidence.

I realise this might not be all that scary but it's something that I can't explain and among a lot of strange things that happened surrounding his death like friends being scared to stay over because our place was haunted, mum telling me she'd woken up and seen him standing at the end of her bed (again with yellow skin) and some other 'ghosty' things, it's the one thing that I can't find an answer too.

I'm a skeptic. I like to read about scary things but have trouble believing most of what I read. This dream was vivid. I can still recall it. I didn't tell anyone about it. Years later my brother recalls an incredibly similar dream with details that seem to particular to be a coincidence.

I'd love some possible theories. Was it grief, a coping mechanism that happened to share identical details or something unexplainable?

TL:DR - Dad commits suicide, me and my brother have an identical dream where we see him in a forrest not knowing he was dead and looking sad.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_wjjxt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/wjjxt/my_dad_didnt_know_he_was_dead/,

I had always joked with my co-workers about our store being haunted and never really took any strange happenings seriously. In 2007, I was offered a job doing security for the mall and took it because it payed as much starting as I made as a manager at the store I worked at. The only drawback? It was graveyard.

 During this time the mall was adding skylights, tearing down a Mervins and building a Nordstrom. My first incident was the early morning of ""black Friday"" a little after 3am. I was driving around the parking lot and happened to see a large man in a security uniform in our office. We have an outside office with a glass door and a code lock. Normally this would not be out of the ordinary as we has several very cliche security guards. The problem was that the only other person working was a small cambodian man. I called my other officer over to report what I had seen and he informed me that in 2005 a guard had died of a heart attack at the mall. He showed me a picture that was posted in the lunchroom and I was shocked to see the resemblence between him and who I had seen in the office minutes before. My coworker and I laughed about how we had an extra officer for back up and continued our shifts.

 A few months later, I was delivering something to the mall office when I heard an old man say behind me""excuse me, miss?"" I turned around and said ""yeah, what's up?"" to find no one there. Now mind you I was in a locked back hallway and I ran up and down that hallway searching for the source of this voice and found nothing to explain it.

 Now most people dont realize how many suicides actually happen at malls but I know of 3 at my mall (one I found). There used to be a police substation on one of the porches. One day for what ever reason some african american dude shot himself in the head right next to the substation. While they were tearing down this substaition and building new stores, a lot of strange things happened in that area. I saw a black man frantically trying to get housekeepings attention to no avail. (The housekeeper had no idea what I was talking about) A tenant looked in a store window and saw a black mans reflection waving his arms next to her as we were walking. It always happens in the same area of the mall as the suicide. One night, I went to unlock a service door on that very porch. As I approached I started to smell a mixture of honey bucket and dead animal. When I opened the door, I found that the light had gone out in the hallway and it was pitchblack. Or so I thought. A figure started to come towards me that was even blacker than the hallway and the smell intensified. I actually ran back to the car waving my hands in the air and screaming.

 This one I think was the worst. You know how when you are in a well lit room and you look in a window at night? All you can see is your reflection right? Well we were having a blizzard and I was working by myself. I decided to go out for smoke. As I was walking out, I happened to glance at my reflection. There was some sort of animal behind me. A big one that I had never seen before. I looked down and ran my ass outside. Once I gathered myself I started to think about what I was going to do because there was no way in hell I was going back in that office. I thought 'hey I'll just drive around' Nope the car keys are on the office desk. 'Ok I'll just walk around the mall for a while and hang out with housekeeping' Nope the mall keys are on the desk. 'ok fuck this place. I quit!' ha! nope keys are on the desk. I waited in the snow during a blizzard for 3 hours until the next guard came on duty.

 Most recent. I saw someone sitting in a massage chair after hours in the suicide area. Then I saw a kiosk chair move without making a sound. This is damn near impossible unless it is lifted off the ground. Later that night I had a nightmare about demon possession. Super scary. Anyway I hope I didn't ramble on... I'm usually just a lurker

I have one of my own to tell, and although I have passed this on to friends and (some) family over the years, I have never shared it with like minded people like yourselves.  Just as an FYI, I am VERY easily scared and do believe in spirits, paranormal activity and most other ‘supernatural’ things – I almost wish I didn’t!  My (now ex) boyfriend (we’ll call him Dan) who was with me at the time does not remotely believe in any of this stuff, although after this encounter he was as petrified as me...

I had just moved into a new area and it was quite remote.  Not totally in the middle of nowhere, but lots of forests and dark country roads with no street lights in the area.  To get to Dan’s house from my new house was pretty straight forward and only involved a couple of busy main roads so not too much of a problem, but there were alternative, quicker ways to get to his using the country roads that were dark, driving past empty fields, woodland areas and had no street lights on the road. 

One night I was at Dan’s and we had to go back to mine for some reason (I think I was staying the night at his and had forgotten something important).  Instead of taking the usual route, as it was a weekend-night we decided to go the ‘back way’ through all the dark country roads.  Sometimes when you do this you find shortcuts which are easier during daylight rush hour, and as we had all the time in the world and I wasn’t driving alone, I agreed.

We started off driving and chatting, just like normal, but as it was dark Dan couldn’t exactly remember the way we should be going.  It wasn’t too much of a problem at the time, as it wasn’t like we were driving around the Himalayas, just rural Essex.  In hindsight, at some point along the way I took a left turn instead of a right, which made us venture further from the main road that lead to my house, and deeper into the country side.  The roads can get quite narrow and as we had gone the wrong way I was forced to drive down a pitch black road with a slight hill on each side – the road was only big enough for one car, to the point where if we opened the car windows we couldn’t have held our arms out straight on either side as we would have hit the banks.  This freaked me out, as I wasn’t used to driving down dark, windy country roads and I was initially scared that another car would come along and we would get stuck.  Stupidly, I sped up, wanting to find my way out of the dark roads quickly.  It became apparent I was driving too fast for the bumpy roads so initially had to slow down, and once I did I felt a deep thud on the roof of my car, like something had landed on it.  I slammed my breaks on and my boyfriend and I looked at each other, but all we heard was silence.  Then, we heard 2 loud thumps on the roof of the car, almost like someone pounding a fist on it.  I looked at my boyfriend, and he looked at me, all pale and wide eyed so I slammed the car in to gear and took off down the road, seriously panicking now...  I couldn’t see anything in the mirrors, and up ahead was a small bridge that went over a tiny river – I sped over the bridge and then the road veered sharply to the right – as I took this corner, the entire road was illuminated in my headlights and it was COVERED in blood.  Literally SO much blood, like a very big animal had been slaughtered there.  There wasn’t any animal remains, but the amount of blood was ridiculous.  I screamed “what the hell is that” and looked at my boyfriend, who was looking out of his window – I looked at where he was looking and we could see a faint figure of a man running alongside the car.  Safe to say I totally shit myself, and took off at a very high speed – luckily we were only 5-10 minutes from the main road and miraculously managed to find our way back.  As soon as we got to my house I literally ran in and locked the door and swore to myself I would never drive that way again.  It took Dan a good 20 minutes to convince me to drive back to his the well lit, busy way as by this point I was in a bit too much of a state to even drive.  Scariest moment of my life, and to this day I don’t know WHAT it all was.  

The vision of the guy running was described as ‘faint’ because it wasn’t just a regular person.  I don’t really know how to describe it because although it was PITCH BLACK outside the car, the person that was running also looked like it was black, but we could still make out the shape - the face had no features, it was almost a bit shimmery at the edges, but was definitely human form, even if it wasn’t human.  Whatever it was also managed to keep up with my car, which was quite a feat considering I was driving it like a monster truck because I was so scared.  There were no trees or anything around for a mile or two, so when we could see the guy running he would have just been running on grass, but there was something not quite right about it – The vibe I got was that it wasn’t a person but an entity  and it was all connected, like the thing we saw running was the same thing that made the noise on the roof of my car and created the blood.


Just thinking about it now sends a shiver down my spine.  I didn't sleep properly for WEEKS after that and even now I hate driving down relatively pedestrianised country roads alone :/",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1jf6zv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1jf6zv/weird_entity_in_woods/,

Sorry if it ends up being a wall of text.

I was sixteen at the time and had just openly renounced my families belief system (christian). I was in a rebellious phase and I decided to start trying to find new beliefs of my own. Well what is the opposite of being a good little devote christian boy? Yep, I thought to myself, I will start playing with witchcraft! It sounded like fun, it was new and it was edgy. 

I started reading everything I could get my hands on if it had anything to do with magic. Everything from new age energy working, to Voodoo, and Hoodoo and anything even closely related. During my time of study I had started gathering my materials, candles, incense, and a few other small items. After I felt that I had the basics down it was time to begin.

I waited until it was the night of a full moon. Everyone in the house was asleep but me. I pulled out my secret cache of ritual tools, and I cleared my floor. I set up my candles and cast my circle. After a period of time just trying to meditate and set a bit will into motion (cast a spell), I figured that I had done well. I blew out my candles, rearranged my room, and crawled into bed. Nothing happened that night. 

Before I ever started down this path, the pets of the house would make their way through my room to lounge and just hang out. One of our cats spent most of his time just sleeping in my room. Within a few days that started to change, the cats wouldn't come near my room. I even tried bringing the cat that normally slept with me into my room so I could pet him. He hissed, and fought me, and twisted out of my arms and ran out of my room. 

 My room started to get cold, real cold, the see your breath kind of cold. All of this in the late spring early summer of Kansas. I knew something was going on but I couldn't figure out what it was.

About a week after my night of dabbling, I was laying in bed trying to fall asleep, and I couldn't. Something was wrong in my room and I could tell. Out of nowhere the hackles on my neck raised and I broke out in goosebumps. I was hit with a feeling of sheer terror, I was pinned down to my bed, I went to scream. I felt something reach into my throat and lock my vocal cords. The only thing that I was able to do was visualize an explosion of white energy from within my body outward. It worked, I was free.

 I did a run down on what in the hell had just happened. Then I realized why things had gone crazy. I never closed my circle! I had left an open doorway for whatever wanted to come through, to do so. Then and there I closed my circle, cleaned it and did a warding.

However, I am open to believing that there is ""something"" out there. The following is a few of my experiences working at a nursing home in Texas sometime 1995 or 1996.

One hallway of the nursing home was dedicated to people who were on medicaid. I worked the evening shift which ended about 10 or 11 pm I think. There were weird things that happened here and there but the epicenter of weirdness seemed to be room 132 in the medicaid hallway. The pipes in the bathroom made odd noises which wasn't too unusual but that was only the beginning. Every single person that ended up in that room seemed to go crazy or die within a few weeks.

There was one nice old lady whose name now escapes me. I think her family ended up running out of money and she was moved to room 132 in the medicaid hall. She was always super nice but within a few days of moving to room 132 she began to act really mean toward people or complain about really strange things.

I only worked that hallway occasionally but when I did I would have to turn the water off in the bathroom sink or shut the closet door repeatedly throughout my shift. One night I put this poor woman to bed and she seemed terrified of her room. I felt bad to leave her in there. Her call light came on a couple of hours later. I went in and asked her what was wrong. She asked me to lock the wheels on her wheelchair because it kept rolling back and forth. When I checked the wheels the brakes were on! This kind of freaked me out but my patients were sometimes a little senile or crazy. I pretended to lock the wheels and told her it wouldn't move anymore.

Later that night, before my shift was over, I went back to her room to change her. Her closet door was open, the bathroom door was open, and the wheelchair was in a different place in the room than where I left it with the wheels still LOCKED! I was really flipping out at this point but trying to stay calm. I was the ONLY person in that hallway all night and the brakes on that wheelchair were tight! Also, this woman absolutely could not get up without my help. Even then it was a chore.

I got her changed as fast as could. This woke her up. She said she was having nightmares. I kept feeling like there was something standing by the curtains in her room staring me down. I didn't see a thing but I kept seeing movement out of the corner of my eye. I got out of there as quickly as I could but I felt really sorry for her. She was stuck in there! This person died a couple of weeks later and I left the job shortly thereafter.

Also, if any of you have ever worked in nursing homes or hospitals you may experienced the ""rule of three"" as I call it. When one person died we all knew that two more people would die within three days. They always died in threes. We could go several weeks without a death and then, bam, three in one week.

There were also a few positive experiences. A few people that passed went very peacefully and it was almost like you could feel them exit the room. One woman that was well-loved by all the nurse aides became very sick and was literally near death for an entire weekend. When she was conscious she would tell us not to worry about her because the man with the beard was taking care of her. When we asked her where this man was she said he sits on the window (the windows were low and had a ledge you could sit on). Maybe she was just delusional but every time I went in her room that weekend it seemed bright and peaceful, even at night. She died shortly thereafter and the room seemed normal again after that.

Maybe all of these things have natural causes but if anyone reading this has felt something like an overbearing presence in a room radiating fear and malice then you know the feeling I had that night in that room.

Fast forward to 2011. My parents divorced, and my dad and I moved up to a cabin in the woods 10 miles east of where I grew up, landing me within walking distance of THE lake of the area. I grew up around this lake, so I had no discomfort in walking around at night. 

The town we moved to, I now believe, is a votex. There's really no other way for me to describe it. It's just a vortex and nothing good can come from it.

It was late July, around 11:30pm, 80* with a slight breeze, and not a cloud in the sky blocking my view of the stars. It was awesome. About fifteen minutes into my walk, I hear a woman crying. There are people camping all over the lake, so I figure one woman is just having a bad night. It's off-putting, but I keep walking. 

I hear her again, and she sounds closer. I realize she's crying out, and after sitting still I can make out ""Oh hijos mios!"" (Oh, my children!)

*Oh.* 

I look around and sure enough, I see a woman kneeling at the water's edge about 100ft further along the bank, crying. She looks at me and starts to get up, and I run as fast as I can back home. I get home, lock the doors, turn on the lights, shut all the blinds, and hide in my room until sunup. 

I haven't gone to the lake, since, day or night.

As for this one, I'll start by clarifying my side of this experience through my own eyes, then go into the story that my sister told me.

So essentially, as in my previous thread, I noted that our house was certainly not normal. Odd events that do not ascribe to our version of reality were commonplace on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. When we first moved into the house it was the worst - my sister apparently chose the very worst room in the house for activity. At the time I was very jealous because at thirteen she got the high-ceilinged room with the mirrored doors on the closet and painted it (I kid you not) hot pink. I wanted her room until we started noticing the general weirdness in the house (see my past post). Her room, however, was the worst. Her alarm clock would fly across the room (this is all recounted from her, so I cannot personally vouch for this stuff, but she sounded terrified telling me). Dark shadows would move in the closet mirrors. She turned her bed so she would not be able to see the mirror at night. One night she woke up and looked to the foot of her bed to see, plain as day, a girl in a white tank top and shorts, who looked utterly normal, watching her quietly. Apparently her only response was to turn over and go back to sleep (kudos to her in my book) and the girl was gone without a trace when she woke up.

But these were the small things, the manageable things. It was this *one* thing that scared her so badly she wouldn't speak of it for a year. The night it happened, I remember she ran into my room at maybe 2 or 3 am in an absolute panic. She threw the light on as she came, slammed the door, and woke me up in a complete state. ""Please turn on music, please,"" she told me. I thought she had just had a minor incident and groaned at her - but she went and found my stereo in the back of my closet, plugged it in, and turned it on herself. She was *shaking*. I asked her if she had a nightmare and she shook her head. She refused to turn off the light, so I spent the whole night with the light on, music on, and her on the side of my queen bed farthest from the door. She would not tell me what had happened no matter how much I begged, and eventually I thought better of it and decided maybe it was best not to know. I only remembered a year later, and asked her, ""What really happened that night?"" She looked at me soberly and said, ""Do you really, really want to know?"" I nodded. And this is the story, and I saw in her eyes, the *truth* she told.

She said she woke up in the middle of the night and heard, strangely, the sound of one of our dogs in the upstairs hallway. This is weird because our dogs literally always slept outside, so she kind of rolled towards her open bedroom door, hearing the distinct sound of a dog's paws on carpet running toward her room. Instead of heading for my open door, the noise came towards hers, and around the corner came this *thing*. 

The way she described it was as a girl, on hands and knees sort of, but there was something so animalistic about her movements that my sister was immediately reminded of a dog in a girl's body. Every aspect of its motions were dog-like. It had the face of a girl, with dark black hair and some kind of white dress. Black eyes. But the nose was sniffing, sniffing the floor and the air into her room. The hands - the *paws* were of a dog. The thing came into her room on its hands or paws or whatever, the three toes and nails of an animal, sniffing and crawling towards her. She couldn't move, she said, or scream, as it climbed onto her bed, sniffing all the while up and down each side of her. It was, without any doubt, a demon. This was not a sleep terror, it was absolutely real. She said she tried and tried to make herself wake up before she realized that she already truly was awake, and it was real and above her. Finally she had the strength to abruptly slide out of the bed from under where it crouched over her, and she ran at a dead sprint to my room and turned on the light.

When she told me this, I couldn't sleep because looking in her eyes I knew what she was saying was sincerely the truth. She was almost crying telling me a year later. To know that this kind of stuff actually exists continues to scare the shit out of me even this many years later after moving out of that house. I even had my own experience, and while I don't think it was the same entity, it was eerie.

I remember I was in my room and saw the cat out in the hallway. As per usual, I decided to go grab him and plop him on my bed to cuddle. But this time he didn't respond as per usual - when I picked him up he was stiff and tense in a way I've literally never seen him before and was clearly about to pop out of my arms like a loaded shot. I set him on my bed and he sprinted to the far side of it, away from the floor near the edge of the bed (it was a small room). Every single hair on his body was puffed up so he was twice as big - I've literally never seen him like this since. He kept stalking back and forth with huge dilated eyes, refusing to go near the edge of my bed. I called my sister in, now keeping a wary eye on the empty space on my floor where he was looking - it was probably an 8 foot by five foot space, with the only non-clothes-strewn carpet area being the one by my bed. My sister also agreed it wasn't normal, but I grabbed the cat and placed him at the edge of the bed so he would have to look at the space on the floor. Every part of his body twisted and strained as I set him down and he literally clawed his way back to the safety of the window. It was the response of a cat placed in front of a snarling wolf or something - I have no idea what he saw. After this bizarre behavior, he finally got up the cat nerve to walk to the edge of the bed and take the biggest leap I have ever seen - over that spot on the floor and directly to the doorway, where he sprinted out and eventually returned to stalk back and forth looking into my room. Needless to say I didn't sleep in my room that night. He has never acted in such a way before or since.

The strangest thing, though, is that when my sister tells people this story, they usually have heard one just like it. The same girl/dog thing, the same paralysis. The creepiest similar one I heard was of an army recruit in his barracks who saw the dog girl, and not a single person around him (maybe forty) woke up. We never meet the people who experienced this same phenomenon, but the stories are always terrifyingly similar. This is the part that scares me the most. I hope to god I will never experience the same thing as them...",,False,,t5_2sntx,1357947070.0,,,True,t3_10b4fw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/10b4fw/fam_our_legitimately_haunted_house_cont/,

A few friends and I were in South America for a couple months and had decided beforehand to hike the Inca Trail. I'll fast forward to the third night here, as the first couple days and nights were paranormally uneventful. 

On the third night, our guide tells us the story of the campground we were staying that night. He told us that about a decade or two (I can't remember the exact range, but I would venture it was closer to the latter), there used to a small mining village by the campsite we were staying at. One night, the Shining Path ripped through the area and massacred the town, executing a bunch of the villagers in the caves around the town.

At this point, our guide tells us that if we see any lights in the night, or hear anybody calling our name (he said it would sound like our friends or family, telling us to follow them) that we should remember to stay put, and that the lights and voices were the spirits trying to trick us into getting lost in the jungle. He also told us that he had hikers that had been dragged out of their tents by their feet. I guess it was a sort of revenge against the interlopers sort of thing. 

That night, my buddy and I were in our tent and of course telling each other ghost stories to keep the 'spooky campfire' atmosphere going. We went to bed pretty early as the campsite was pitch black, so I'm not too sure when all the creepy stuff happened, but I think I had only been asleep a few hours before everything started.

Our tents were pretty tiny two man jobs (built for Peruvians, I guess. Not for taller Canadians), so our feet would be against the entrance of the tent at all times. As I was saying, a few hours into the night, the sounds started. You know the sound when something brushes against tent/windbreaker fabric? That sort of zippery sound? That was the first thing that woke me up. And it wasn't a fellow hiker, either. The campsite was set up on a three tier sort of embankment, and there was only a couple feet of space between the tent and the next tier below. I mention this because none of us would be able to traverse it without light without tripping on pegs/rope/etc. 

Soon after the sounds started, the touching started. Remember when I said our feet would be touching the tent? Well, something was touching our feet from outside. You could see the tent push in where whatever it was was trying to grab at our feet. It was almost a side swipe, grabbing at our feet. You could feel it, even with our feet inside the sleeping bags.

Not wanting to look like a couple of pansies, my buddy and I went fetal, tried to laugh it off, say it was just a wild chicken or deer. Anything else. Finally, because our eyes couldn't stay open any longer, we crashed.

I don't know how long after this happened, and I've had experience with sleep paralysis before, and this definitely felt similar, but crazy different at the same time.

I woke up. My buddy was staring at me from across the tent. There was a soft light in the tent, and I'm not sure where it came from. I couldn't move. At all. My buddy, without breaking eye contact, sat up, and told me, ""Listen. You need to follow me. You need to come with me right now."" 

And then he reached over towards me as if to unzip my sleeping bag. I couldn't take it - I wrenched my head to the side, willing my body to move (this is what happens in sleep paralysis with me). All of a sudden, the lights go out and I'm staring at my buddy, who is once again looking straight at me.

He told me that I had screamed in my sleep and woken him up, but I couldn't tell if I was where I was and if he was who he was and if I was even in the real world. I had to get him to prove it was actually him. This entire time, something was pushing our tent in sporadically and rubbing against the outside. 

Eventually, I was satisfied he was real, and I forced myself to sleep so I could forget the damn sounds and whatever was outside and wake up to sunlight.

The next day, a few other hikers said they had issues with things touching their tent. One even said he was positive the zipper on his tent was moving up slowly.

Real or not, it sure freaked me out and made me speed hike to put as much distance between that campsite and me.

I have a couple other (nearly 100% it was) sleep paralysis stories if anybody is interested in hearing about them.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1ftdbx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1ftdbx/ghosts_on_the_inca_trail/,

I at one time thought that I may be crazy.

The first time I remember something being off was when I was about 6 or 7 and my paternal grandfather died. My dad had left to go to the hospital to pick him and my grandma up, and when he was gone I told my mom that grandpa had died. My mom just shook her head and said no daddy is going to go get him. And I told her again that grandpa was dead that he fell over and died. About an hour or so later my dad called my mom from the hospital and said that my grandpa died. Later that night I remember I was in my bed looking out the window when my grandfather appeared in my room and told me that he loved me and that he was okay. A few years later I was talking to my dad about knowing grandpa had died and how, and my dad froze, in fact my grandfather had died from a heart attack while he was walking to the bathroom, he fell on the floor. I don't exactly know how i knew he died, I don't know if it was a dream I just knew that it had happened.

My next encounter is a collection of things that happened at my grandmom's house. My grandmom and grandpa (the one who had passed) lived right across the street from my house so I went over and stayed with my grandmother a lot. At one point my great grandmother (my grandmother's mom) moved in with my grandmother. She had a bedroom at the end of the hall and her window faced my bedroom window. She had a recliner in her room and often sat in it and I could see her from my room. She would wave and I would wave back. Eventually she moved to California with my great uncle and aunt and passed away there. One night I was looking out my window and her recliner was turning in the room back and forth really slow and creepy like. Also, in that house, we would hear voices from different areas of the house. This is the house that my dad grew up in and when he and my mom were dating he was on the phone with her alone in the house and someone called out his name three times. HOWARD! HOWARD! HOWARD! It was loud enough that my mom heard it through the phone. When I was a kid the house freaked me out. That bedroom that my greatgrandmom stayed in was at the end of the long part of the hallway, kind of around a corner. The attic door was also down that way and it was an old door with one of those latched handles. It made a distinct noise when it would open. Every once in a while we would hear that door latch open. It was also always very cold in that one spot, even on the most humid summers day in southern New Jersey. Whenever I stayed the night at my grandmoms we always slept in the living room, my grandmother always slept in a recliner and I would sleep on her couch. If I had to go to the bathroom I would always wake my grandmom up so she could point the flash light up the stairs so i could go. I was honestly scared of the second floor of that house. 

Next thing that happened was when I was about 9 or 10, I had become very ill and was sleeping in our living room. I was watching cartoons when out of no where this man was in our living room with me. He was dressed in old fashion type clothes and a top hat. He kept telling me that he really liked me, and that I was a smart and caring girl. I asked him his name and he said James, and that he was there to make sure that I would stay safe. He said that Wesley sent him, which threw me because Wesley is my grandfather's name who had passed. He continued to tell me that I was going to be okay and such. And then all the sudden he was gone. 

After my grandmother moved out of the house, my eldest cousin moved into the house. I would go over there and hangout with him, and one night his fiance and i were playing checkers. We got up to get a drink in the kitchen came back and only one of the pieces was missing. A red one gone, we looked all over that house for that checker piece and never found it. Things like that happened a lot there.

Other little things happened here and there through out my life. Another big thing was when I was 24 I had a really bad car accident, i was trapped in my car. I never lost consciences and remember the whole thing. As I was sitting in the car trapped (my legs were pinned down) this man in a old fashioned wool coat and older looking fedora type hat came to the window and was trying to keep me calm, saying elh1983 you are going to be okay stay calm you are fine. He was there, and even my friend who was in the car infront of me recalled seeing him there. But when I said something to the cop who was talking to me from the passenger side of the window told me there was no possible way someone would be able to talk to me from the driver side of the car because I was up against a guardrail that was blocking me from a steep embankment. There were no foot prints in the snow on that side either, he checked when they got me out of the car. I honestly think he had to be some kind of guardian angel.

 After my mom passed away and my son was born. my mom died in November of 2008 and my son was born in February of 2009. My dad still lived in the house that I grew up in, and was alone since my mom died. I had kept some things at the house and came home one day to get a few things out of my old bedroom. My dad was gone so I let myself in put my son down on the floor in his car seat, he was sleeping so I put the baby bag on the table and I went up stairs. About 45 mins later I am in my old closet gathering some things when I hear my son starting to cry, I figured he was hungry and started to walk towards the stairs when he just stopped. So finished what I was doing. Headed down stairs into the dinning room and saw my son had a binky in his mouth and passed out. The binky was in the baby bag on the table above him there was no way he could even get to it since he was 3 months old. The room smelled like lilacs which was my mom's favorite flowers. I figured she just was visiting.

And the last thing has to do with my daughter who is now 3 years old. One night she had fell asleep in her playroom while watching Cinderella. I left her in there while I was finishing laundry and putting towels away. I was in the kid's bathroom when all the sudden I hear her talking. She is laughing and chatting away. I hear her say things like ""Mommy tells me I look just like you"" ""Yes I promise to be good"" ""Oh I love you too granmom"" So I walk towards the room and she is sitting in the floor looking right at the couch like someone was sitting there. She pulled out a book turned back to the couch and started to cry. I walked in and asked her what was wrong and she said my grandmom left without saying bye!! I want hugs and kisses!! I said Ellie who were you talking to she said GRANMOM!! I told her to show me, she walked out to the living room and pointed to a picture from my sisters wedding. It was of me my dad my sister and my mom, she said HER my granmom. I said do you see her a lot? She said yeah silly she comes here all the time and reads and talks to me. Ellie was born after my mom died, she never met her.

1362429129.0,60,self.Thetruthishere,19npsa,[ME][FAM] I think my dad was followed by a possibly demonic entity.,vondahl,70,10,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/19npsa/mefam_i_think_my_dad_was_followed_by_a_possibly/,"My grandparents on my dad's side lived in a nice, small home in the suburbs of Chicago. They were the first owners of the house. Also, as far as I know, no one in my family has ever been diagnosed with any type of mental disorder, and we've never suffered from hallucinations.

This happened when I was fairly young (6-8), but I remember it clearly. The house itself didn't have a very nice atmosphere or ""feel"" to it. A lot of the curtains would be drawn, so it was a bit gloomy. My grandparents did not have a happy marriage, and my father did not have a happy childhood. His parents never praised him or gave him any love and affection. I think that this negative energy in the house may have attracted a negative entity.

However, I think the entity only manifested itself in the hallway in the back of the house that connected the bedrooms. That hallway had a way of making you feel truly awful. My little sister and I normally would've avoided it, but my grandma had colon cancer and would be in the main bathroom for a long time. If we had to go to the bathroom badly enough, we had no choice but to use the one at the end of the hallway. 

When we would walk down the hallway, we always felt really threatened and hunted. I felt like someone or something wanted to kill me. I haven't ever felt like that in my life, except in this hallway. I also would get a feeling like something was standing directly behind me, and the hairs on my neck would prickle.

Feeling threatened when no visible danger is eminent is unpleasant enough, but we saw a silhouette in the hallway multiple times as well. 

We would oftentimes run down the hallway into the bathroom, and when we were finished, we'd poke our heads out to make sure it was ""safe."" On more than one occasion, I remember poking my head out and looking down the hallway, and seeing a man's dark silhouette pull his head back into one of the rooms, like he had been peeking at us and then didn't want us to see him. 

I've spent a lot of time trying to think of light sources and what it could've been, but there's just no explanation. I know it wasn't my dad or grandpa because I would've seen their face. It was just a silhouette with no body attached to it. The first time I saw it, I pulled my head back into the bathroom and my sister and I exchanged this look, confirming that we both saw whatever that just was.

Seeing the silhouette peering out of rooms was all I ever saw, but my sister said that she saw its whole ""body"" one time when she was walking to the bathroom. She said it was walking towards her, and stopped to look at her, and then walked into one of the bedrooms. She said she at first felt threatened, but then she felt this incredible sadness and anger coming from the entity. She was young, but she definitely remembers this incident.

We tried telling my parents that we'd seen something weird in the hallway, but they'd just tell us that it was our imaginations and to not be afraid. This was upsetting since we *know* we saw something. 

I didn't find out until I was much older that my parents had seen it too. My sis and I were talking about it, and my mom overheard. We asked her if she had lied to us when we were kids, and she confessed that she did because she didn't want us to be scared. 

My dad grew up in that house, and he slept in the bedroom that was directly across from the hallway bathroom. He said he always felt so scared and threatened, like we did. He said that several times, he had to go to the bathroom badly in the middle of the night. Like us, he'd poke his head out and see a silhouette looking back at him, and then pulling its head back into another room. Mind you, this is nighttime so the entity was darker than the already dark hallway. 

What scared me more was that, when he was a teen, my dad said he was laying on his bed listening to some music this one afternoon. He was awake and this was not a night terror. All of a sudden, he felt this enormous pressure on his ankles, like someone was pressing down on them and then the entire bed starting shaking violently. He said it eventually stopped, but he was too scared to move afterwards.

My dad started dating my mom when they were 18, and she reported that she had seen this silhouette in the hallway as well. When my mom and dad would hang out, they almost always went to my mom's house but she'd definitely seen it on the few occasions they were at my dad's house.

They got married at 21 I think, and moved into their own apartment. My mom said that at first the apartment felt just fine, but every once in a while, she'd feel that same threatened feel and terror outside of their bedroom. 

This one summer afternoon, she was about to go into the bedroom to grab something, and she claims that she walked through the entity in the doorway. She said it was like her breath was taken away suddenly, and it felt ice cold when she was warm just a second ago. She felt scared and endangered until she left the bedroom. 

She told me that the bad feelings in the apartment were on and off, whereas the hallway in my grandparent's house was a constant feeling of sheer terror. 

On night, she and my dad were in bed and she was trying to sleep. My dad (a former alcoholic) was completely passed out drunk, and my mom (a lifetime sufferer of insomnia) was laying there wide awake. As she was laying there, she said the room suddenly felt awful and she felt threatened. Then, there was the pressure on her ankles and the bed started shaking. She yelled at my dad and tried to wake him up, but he was out cold and she couldn't seen to break her ankles free. She yelled, ""GO AWAY!"" at the entity and the bed shaking stopped and the bad atmosphere left the room. 

She thought this was the last of it, but she said that this happened to her once more when my dad was at work. It was a weekend, so she got to sleep in. Sunlight was pouring in the room and she was just enjoying the warmth of her cozy bed since she didn't have to get up for work. Again, she felt fine one second and then suddenly the room had an oppressive feel to it and she went from relaxed and happy, to terrified and hunted. She felt pressure on her ankles and the bed started shaking. 

Although she wasn't very religious, she started yelling at the entity that it wasn't welcome there and she loudly said The Lord's Prayer and told the entity to leave and never come back, that she wasn't afraid of it and it couldn't hurt her because she was protected. It probably sounds like a corny scene from a movie, but the shaking stopped and she said that she never had any problems with this ""thing"" ever again. 

I don't know if my mom or dad saw it in the hallway years later when all four of us would visit the grandparents, but I know my sister and I did. I don't know if all of this was caused by carbon monoxide or EMF or something like that, but the fact that these events happened at two separate locations to four separate people on multiple occasions make me think it's a little more than that. I'm naturally a skeptic, but this made me wonder if there's a little more to life that we can't always see and explain. 

**TL;DR - Several times, everyone in my family has seen, at some point, a dark silhouette of a man in my grandparent's hallway. We've all felt really threatened and terrified, like we were being hunted and about to get killed. My parents have both respectively experienced (while wide awake and during day time hours) a pressure on their ankles in bed like they were being held down, and the entire bed shook violently. My mom yelled at it to leave her alone, and prayed aloud and she said she never was bothered by it since then.**",,False,,t5_2sntx,1362429482.0,,,True,t3_19npsa,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/19npsa/mefam_i_think_my_dad_was_followed_by_a_possibly/,
1354600296.0,60,self.Thetruthishere,148ypc,[ME] While hunting with my father as a teen. ,OdnsRvns,85,25,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/148ypc/me_while_hunting_with_my_father_as_a_teen/,"First let me say i found this subreddit using the random button and loved a lot of the stories here. Second I don't tell this story often because of how crazy it sounds to me when i say it out loud. I'll try an tell the story as quickly as i can but it may be a bit of a tale. 

So I'm about 13-14 years old and the one thing me and my father enjoy doing together is fishing and coon hunting. He coon hunted as a kid and sold the pelts for cash. It was kind of something I did just to spend time with my old man. We hunt a hand full of spots every fall/winter, so we're pretty accustom to all the areas and the trails/roads we take. 

My dads a bit of a story teller, one of thosethat tells the same stories every time we go to a place or remind him of an event. So he has told me a hundred times or so about loosing his best coon dog ""Hank"" in the area he claims the locals call ""The Devils Backbone"". Lets call it TDB for short. 

TDB is a weird place, out on a never ending gravel road you pass an abandoned school house and there is this god awful grinding of an old oil pump from about a mile away. a the end of the dirt road there is a T intersection with a field in front of you that's maybe 5 or so football fields wide. To the right and left of us are woods/brush. 

Its a little before midnight when we park the truck about 200 yds away from and let the dog out the back. Hutch our dog has always been a good hunter so we cheat a bit let him run then when we hear him bey drive up the T and turn right or left based where hes at. Hutch plops down of the tail gate and shoots into the wood and me and dad hop back in the truck waiting for the call. We crack open the mason jars of chilli we bring every trip and nothing but out parking lights on.

After about 10 minutes I hear Hutch howling and going ape shit. I open the door and stand up out the truck trying to hear where he is. Dad fires the truck up and plops the lights on. Now not a minute later i hear my dog growling and the sounds of what i know are him fighting with something. Right after that(I'm not sure how to explain this) and upright lets say man like figure about 6' walks across the head lights in front of us about 50 yds up. His eyes glowing yellow from what i assume is the Tapetum Lucidum in his eye. Then silence. No dog, no woods moving, no wind, just the sound of that old oil pump grinding away. 

I hop back in the truck and look at my dad. ""Did you see that?"" he shakes his head ""looked like a man with fur but i couldn't tell, only saw him a second"". We discuss it for a little longer and decide it was probably just another hunter out here that didn't have permission. We were freaked a little  and decided to get hutch and call it a night.

I hop back out the truck and yell for the dog and dad turns off the lights on the truck. 

Now I'm not sure if the lights we saw were always there or we just didn't notice them till the truck lights flipped off. Above the tree line of the field in front of us were glowing orbs of light of different colors. Orange, light blue, green, light red about 25 in total. I sit back down and we just sit and stare at the lights for what seems an eternity. We drive closer up to the T before a single word is said.

The sky glows like you would see a city/large business in the distance. The orbs are just there fixed. They don't move or change color it reminds me of stadium lights in the middle of a forest. So we sit there and watch, ask our selves the usual questions. ""Whats back there?"", nothing its all woods, ""Combines maybe doing a night harvest"" nope woods and the river, ""You sure there are no farms right there"" I'm sure.

We finally get hutch back to the truck and get him squared away. We watch the lights for another 15 or so minutes and head home. Watching them in our rear view mirrors as we turn around and drive out. We went back to the spot the next night without the dog and no lights. I hunted that spot 20 times before and many times since and have never seen them lights before or after. To this day I have no real explanation for the lights.

**TLDR: Went night hunting with my dad saw a large man like creature and some crazy lights both still unexplained.**

**EDIT:** Wow was not expecting many people to read all of this, thanks so much. My dad has some crazy stories from his childhood i'll try and get him post them sometime.

He had this extra job in the years between when his first wife left him and when he met my mother, so he was forced to bring my then infant brother with him when he stayed overnight at the house.

The doctor moved out of the house after his wife committed suicide in the master bedroom, but refused to sell it. Since it was extremely big and sat back from the road it was a perfect spot for the local teenagers to sneak into and party, drink, etc until the doctor began hiring cops to spend the night to secure the property.

Anyhow, my dad said he the job was pretty easy. He would walk around the property every few hours but the rest of the time he just watched TV or read or whatever. My brother would sit on the floor and play with his toys or ride his tricycle around the ground floor. 

My dad said there was always an eerie feeling in the house, as though he was being watched and sometimes he would see movement in the corner of his eye. He told me he was able to brush that sort of thing off as no big deal. What really got to him though was when my brother would ride his tricycle down the long hall leading from the den, where my dad and brother spent most their time in the house, to the master bedroom. My dad said every single time my brother would ride down the hall through the door and a few feet into the master bedroom where he would immediately stop, jump off the bike and run crying back into the den and into my dads arms.

My dad said this really creeped him out because he remembered working the crime scene of the wife’s suicide and knew that the spot where my brother stopped his bike was the exact spot where the wife had committed suicide.

(I'm twenty three now so my memory is kind of fuzzy) The room was big enough to have a bed and a few couches and still have room to move around also I'm not sure how other people play but we always played hide and seek in the dark. That means at night with all the lights off and windows covered if there is light coming through. I'm not afraid of the dark at all. In fact I usually like to walk around at night with only the moon as light. (I live out in the country) Well in the middle of playing hide and seek I get this weird feeling that something is off about the room we are in. My immediate instinct was to close my eyes until the game was over. Well I hear my sister Ashley (12) scream ""Turn on the light!""

I didn't see anything but according to her and my cousin Danielle, she saw a white figure with long fingers in the middle of the room crawling towards me.

Please don't use them.,,85,27,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/11d1ya/request_from_usammichmaker_my_experiences_and_a/,"As requested. I'll keep things reasonably brief as I really would rather forget about this stuff. However, I think I'm going to have to make several posts because I have a lot of experiences to tell from another person too. May have to make 3 posts. If there any spelling errors it's because I'm not my new iPad and am a noob when it comes to operating apple products. Sorry in advance.

My friend is actually my mates mum. However during hard times in my own family she has taken me into her house, comforted me, fed me and taken the role of mum where my own mother is permanently  absent. Her name is Laura and I owe a lot to her and her family. I'll begin with Laura's experiences as she is older and wiser than myself.

Laura is somewhat a very gifted woman when it comes to energies, healings, readings and that  kind of thing. She tends to stick to healings and anything to do with, as she says ""positive energies to help, heal and guide"". She is a very lovely lady. She shys away from the ' medium' side of things for many reasons one being that its very draining on her to have her "" 3rd eye"" open for long periods of time and also hard to manage the continuous bombardment of energies that enter through the 3rd eye, good or bad. Another reason, "" spirits always want something"". 

Laura has always been fairly sensible with her abilities and has had them from a young age. Her grandmother taught her how to channel her energies and how to do healings and reiki work. It was during her early 20s when her mates began to dabble in the more darker stuff like seances and ouija boards.

LAURA'S STORY 1:

One night, Laura was invited over to her friend marks house. A bunch of her mates were over there eating and drinking. One of hem had brought an ouija board for a laugh. Laura, being warned from a young age not to dabble with such things, warned the others against it. She had a gut feeling something was not right. Not right at all. Not heeding her warnings, her friends decided to use the ouija board. Laura decided to stay, to at least be the "" guide"" and try to bathe everyone is positive energy or white light whilst this was going down. She still begged and pleaded the friends not to use the board and the dangers that could ensue. But friends being curious and a little drunk didn't listen.

Laura assured me that these friends were actually nice people, especially mark. Mark was studying his bachelors in law or something high up. Had a lot going for him. Smart kid, not inclined to hurt anyone at all. One big softie, who also had a love for Japanese culture and samurai shit. Huge kimono collection and katana collection at his house. He was engaged to a nice girl Sarah, who he lived with. These two, with two others all used the board together.

As the board got more intense, the thing on the other side claimed it was a demon. "" knife "" was all it could say toward the end and the kids got bored and decided to stop ""playing"". However mark decided he wanted to keep talking, and stayed on the ouija board by himself, despite Laura trying to take it off him. It got so bad he actually threatened to hit her if she tried. She decided enough was enough and left.

She received a phone call 2 hours later while she was at home. From the police. Claiming Sarah was dead. Laura was called into questioning. Laura told what went on and was released. 

Apparently after laura left, mark continued to talk to this thing for a while whilst the other 3 sat in the lounge and watched football and had a few cold ones. Mark walked in shaking, pale and with a katana in his hand. They all asked him what was wrong, put down the sword mate etc. mark was trembling at this stage apparently and wouldn't respond. He then turned around and walked back down the hallway. After 30 seconds he came charging up the hallway and into the lounge where he pinned Sarah to the floor and stabbed her straight through the stomach in front of the other two. The other two booked it and called the police. The one thing they apparently kept saying was that a) mark wasn't himself and b) straight through the middle of his moments-ago jet black hair, was a huge white streak that went forehead to back. Mark had apparently aged about 20 years when he came charging up the hallway.

Mark got done for murder but during court proceedings couldn't even string a sentence together, and was sent to an asylum prison instead.

The other two underwent years of therapy. Mark and Sarah's flat apparently burnt to the ground the day of Sarah's funeral. Nothing was left.


LAURA'S STORY 2:


During a healing she was present on with 5 others. This healing for for a young woman who had been fucking around with an ouija board. Laura was being a guide for this particular healing and so she stood behind this woman, hands over the ladies head to centre her and and rest of the group. And to try to ""pull"" out whatever was burdening this lady. As a precaution, Laura had also asked one of her more experienced healer friends to attend this healing as the knew it was going to be heavy, Laura wanted someone else in control there too in case things got out of hand.

They are nearing the end of this healing when Laura claims she felt  heavy breathing on the back of neck and in her hair. The other guide healer apparently turned sheet white and told Laura to "" what ever you do, DO NOT look behind you"". 

Apparently things got fairly hectic after that. Ornaments in the room fell off stuff and smashed, the curtains billowed a little and the back door opened and smashed so hard it broke the glass panes. Laura was instructed to keep going and not to look behind her.

After the healing and telling what ever it was to leave, the other guide told laura what he saw was something he never wanted to see again. The most hideous creature, ugliest  thing he had ever seen in every way and apparently very pissed off had stood behind her as she told it to fuck off and never come back. It was so pissed about it it broke a fucking door and threw shit around the room. The thing just oozed misery, anger and pain beyond belief.

I've had a few occurrences of my own, but nothing quite like they have. I'd love to share all of our various stories, but those are different posts for a different time.
Right now I'm going to share an event that happened to our oldest sister, Kelsey, and her (at the time) husband...

  My sister's husband was 12 years old when he lost his father to cancer. 23 years later, my sister and her husband were coming back home one night after running errands all day. They walked in, unloaded bags of groceries, and checked the answering machine for missed calls. 
There was one message on the machine. They hit play, and were shaken by what they heard. 

  It was his dead father, but it wasn't just a message you would normally hear on an answering machine, like, ""Hey, this is so-and-so, call me back."" And it wasn't just his father either, it was his father and his brother, just having a conversation together. For several minutes the message went on, they talked about nothing in particular, just casual talk, and then it ended in the middle of their chat. Needless to say, my sister's husband was extremely upset (As anyone would be, but he also suffers from severe anxiety, so you can imagine).

  The next day Kelsey went over to her mother-in-law's house for coffee. She told her about the message from the previous night, and her mother-in-law got very serious and explained how today was the anniversary of her late husband's funeral, and how the night before she kept hearing the sound of knocking coming from outside the house, and the sound of a doorbell ringing that sounded nothing like the sound of her actual doorbell. 
Immediately after this discussion, a vase of dried roses kept over from her husband's funeral flew off the shelf they were sitting on. 
As my sister says, they didn't just tip over, they literally flew straight out about a foot from where they were set, and dropped to the floor.

  I think for the most part, the family found comfort in these events. They believe it was just his way of getting their attention, and just letting them know that he never really left.

**And just a clarification note:**
  
  The answering machine was a newer digital machine, not an older one that recorded on tapes, so there was no way it was just an old recording left over from that many years ago.

**ALSO, interesting note:** 
  
  The house they lived in at this time was haunted. Both my sister and her husband would wake up in bed to see a little girl about 5 or 6 years old standing by their bedside or in the corner of their bedroom. Their bedroom was upstairs, right next to the top of the staircase. Perhaps something traumatic happened on the stairs, because there was an unmistakable feeling of dread and sadness that would overwhelm you whenever walking upstairs. 

  Anyway, sorry if this is poorly written, I sort of just threw it together while waiting in McDonalds for a friend to meet me up. I've just been wanting to share some stories of my family's experiences with you kind folks, and figured I may as well crank one out right now to pass the time. Haha.

1366898727.0,57,self.Thetruthishere,1d2znn,Why I stopped staying over at Katy's house [ME] [FR],judkin,63,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1d2znn/why_i_stopped_staying_over_at_katys_house_me_fr/,"**I posted to this to /nosleep, a good while back - before that subreddit was overtaken by the stories and the obviously fake tales. On reflection, I think it belongs here. :)**

My friend Katy told me that her house was haunted before I even set foot in the place. We were both 16/17. She spoke of footsteps at night, items falling off shelves and china ornaments in her bedroom, which had been snapped and broken by someone or something.

It was a decent-sized house, by UK standards: a 1930s, semi-detached family home on the outskirts of town, with four bedrooms and big rooms (UK redditors will recognise the type). Katy had a younger sister; the rest of the family had a policy of not talking about their resident ghost around the sister, for fear of upsetting her.

However Katy and both her parents had experienced strange events in the house, and when I got to know Katy the frequency of events had escalated over the previous couple of years. Katy told me that on one occasion, her mum had woken in the night, freezing cold, to hear heavy footsteps pacing slowly and deliberately around the bed in the master bedroom, before suddenly stopping. (She didn't open her eyes.)

As for the china ornaments: Katy had a lock on her bedroom door, and locked it when she left for school every morning. Her bedroom was at the far end of the upstairs hallway. One day she came home and found that the front leg of a small china animal on her bookshelf (a set of three) had been snapped off and had been left in front of the ornament. It seemed strange but she didn't think too much of it until she came home from school a couple of months later to find that the front leg had been snapped off the second ornament - in exactly the same place. A couple of months later, she came home from school, unlocked her door and - you guessed it - found that the front leg had been snapped off the third china animal. That freaked her out some.

Katy told me these stories, and I didn't really know what to make of them. Was she making them up or exaggerating? Did somebody else have a key to her bedroom door and and was there a prankster in the house? At the time, I didn't know whether or not I even believed in ghosts or poltergeists. If this had not been the case, when Katy's parents went away for the weekend and Katy asked me to stay over for the first time, I probably would have thought twice.

As it was, I didn't give it a second thought. I had already been round plenty in the daytime. The only strange things that had happened up until then would be that sometimes when we were sitting in the living room, the family dog would suddenly spark into life, stare at a spot (not necessarily the same spot) or follow something unseen around the room, then bolt for the door. If the door was closed, the dog would scrabble at it or rush behind the sofa and curl up in a ball there, whimpering. Odd, yes - but hardly proof of a haunting.

So I stayed round and all was fine until the early hours of the morning. I was sleeping on a camp-bed on the floor, next to Katy's bed, and was suddenly wide awake. Katy was fast asleep. I heard footsteps at the other end of the hall. They were slow and deliberate and, as they moved down the the hallway towards Katy's bedroom door, I could also hear the painted wooden floorboards squeaking and creaking underfoot. It must have been seconds; it felt like hours. Looking back, I am surprised that it didn't occur to me that it was a burglar and that I didn't holler for Katy to wake up. Instead, I was certain that it was ""the ghost"" and I was terrified of what would happen when it got to Katy's bedroom door. I froze, screwed my eyes up tightly, felt my heart beating like the clappers in my chest and waited as the footsteps got closer. They got to the door, they stopped... and then off they went, back along the hallway. I couldn't get back to sleep (perhaps not surprising!) but I didn't hear the footsteps again.

In the morning, I told Katy what had happened. She reacted angrily, which surprised me at the time considering that she had already told me about the strange events in the house in some detail. Looking back though, I can only begin to imagine how stressful it must have been, living somewhere like that.

Katy insisted that I must have been imagining things and that there had been no footsteps. Or perhaps a window had been left open or loose and had been banging in the wind. We checked the windows around the house, and they were all closed. That was only the beginning though.

I carried on visiting Katy's house in the weeks that followed and, bar the dog's occasionally odd behaviour in the living room, nothing was amiss.

Then one day in the summer, Katy and I were in her kitchen after school. We were the only two in the house, and Katy decided to make us some dinner. I remember it all very clearly: it was early evening on a light, sunny day. Katy turned on the oven, put in two frozen vegetable kievs (ah, British vegetarian cuisine of times past - it all comes flooding back!) and we made a salad, then we went upstairs to her bedroom until the food was ready.

When we went back down for dinner, the oven was turned off. The food was uncooked. ""The ghost does this sometimes"", said Katy crossly, and turned it on again.

At that exact same moment, the plug-in radio on the other side of the kitchen suddenly burst into life. We jumped. The radio blared at full volume. Katy swore loudly and took a step towards it to turn it off. At that moment the handle on the kitchen tap, which was close to the radio, turned and the tap came on - again, at full force. Katy turned off the tap and the radio. It all happened very quickly.

""Come on, we're getting out"", said Katy. I was shit scared - she was just angry. The door at the back of the kitchen led to the back door via a little utility room, which had a washing machine and one of those wall-to-wall washing lines hung up. She made for this door and I followed. Katy pulled the door open and, as she stepped into the utility room, the indoor washing line suddenly fell from the ceiling as if it had been THROWN at her. She pulled it off her, shouted and swore some - and then everything was quiet. We went into the garden and smoked a couple of cigarettes until our dinner was ready.

After that I decided to stop staying at Katy's house overnight, and didn't experience anything too strange whenever I went round in the day or evening. I caught up with Katy at a wedding a few years ago and it came up in conversation: she remembered the washing line flying at her, but not the rest of it. She left home some years ago now, but the rest of the family still live there and Katy said that peculiar things continue to happen from time to time.

Part 3 - http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1b9skk/me_fr_haunted_asked_for_it_one_week_of_terrifying/

Once again, please comment with any ideas on what could be happening, similar experiences, or questions. 

What happened the second night, started off about the same as the first night. I was with my friends Sean, Jared, Christian, and Collin. We took my car driving around after a party at around 2 am. I told them about how the previous night scared me, but I still wasn't truly scared yet. It's amazing how much we can put up with and not connect together when it's happening to us. I mentioned that a friend showed me an abandoned church about 45 minutes away one time. None of us were going to bed anytime soon, so we decided to go for it.

After driving for a little less than an hour, we pass the restaurant off of highway 10 that it's near, and we start down the winding dirt road that leads to the church. Now, this church is atop a large hill in, virtually, the middle of nowhere. It's lit up from ground lights still for some reason. We pull up to the church, and there's a run down trailer in the field/parking lot right next to the church, and then there is nothing but fields and trees for about half a mile in any direction. We park the car and get out. It's now about 2:45 in the morning. We're in the middle of nowhere at a creepy church, and amusingly enough, Jared smells fresh pizzas being made from the restaurant 2 miles away.

We take the place in, and we notice that there's a small valley, leading to another hill about half a mile away that has lights flickering all about in an eerie orange light, and if we really strain our ears, we can hear what sounds like a voice here and there. The best way to describe this light is that of a bonfire, but shadows were flickering around it as though there was a pow wow going on and people were dancing around it. We could only see these things through trees, and that hill was higher than our own.. So we went to investigate.

We started walking away from the church to the other hill, and we find that there's a path at the edge of the church field that looks like it's been well-worn, and it leads right in the direction we're going. We stumble down in pitch darkness and go down this slight hill for 1/4 of a mile while following this path. It was then that I decided to snap a polaroid since I had just gotten this camera, and I was excited about it. I set it up so the church was directly behind all of my friends, but we were quite a ways away, so it didn't show up in the picture. We then climbed up another 1/4 of a mile to get to this hill.

When we reached the top of the hill we had just seen full of life and what looked like people moving about and voices, we realized that there was nobody there, no light, and that we hadn't heard anything since we started down the path that led directly there. We were telling jokes and calling each other pussies the whole time to keep from thinking about how each of us was actually kind of frightened, so we must have forgotten to listen for voices or people. There is nothing to be found there. Not even the remains of a fire or anything of the sort. So we take a roundabout way back to the church and go inside. It's nothing special, kind of creepy, and we go back outside after scaring each other a few times. Jared and I are at my car while the 3 other guys chase around a medium sized black dog they find (I should have realized black animals are not my thing at that point, but I didn't.) Jared and I are talking by my car, and he points something strange out. He mentions to me that there isn't a house very close by, and that we smelled fresh pizza in the immediate area.. Now that could have been from the restaurant, but when we passed by it, we saw that it was closed and probably had been since 10 or 12. Jared says cautiously, ""What if it's coming from in there."" As he looks over at the old dilapidated trailer near the church. I then wonder where a smaller (obviously non farm dog) would come from so late.. I tell the guys to get in the car. We're leaving.

We back out of our hidden parking spot on the far side of the church, and as I swing my car around to leave, there is this dog standing totally still in the middle of the field/parking lot. The guys are a little scared at this point. It's just staring at us. I get closer and closer to it because it's blocking my exit, but it doesn't move. I finally get within 20 feet of this dog, that looks about 20 -30 pounds, and realize.. it is the biggest rabbit I have ever seen in my whole life, and it's completely black. We make this realization and stop the car completely. Just then, as if it knew we had figured it out, this rabbit runs to the trailer. From there, it stands by the trailer and stares at us again, as if wanting us to follow. Sean says that if we see a mutant rabbit beckoning us, we had better follow it. Collin thinks the opposite. We leave the car running and follow the rabbit.

The rabbit waits patiently for us to jog over until we're within 10 feet of it, and it disappears under the trailer. I turn on my iPhone's flashlight app, and I search under the trailer, the rabbit is honestly gone, and it has nowhere to go except a small patch of trees right behind the trailer. We investigate and find nothing around the area, but we're already by the trailer, so we check it out.

This trailer looks at least 20 years old. It's got bricks under it and the wheels are blocked, and it's falling apart. The pizza smell is long gone. I look at the door and tell them that it's locked from the outside. We start to leave when Sean says I should pick the lock. He sees an empty 7up can in my car and remembered that in 9th grade, I used to do this trick where you take a soda can and cut an M shape out of it, and fold it a bit, then stick it into the side of a combination lock at school, and you jiggle it, and it opens. I agree to try and open the lock.

I make the pick, and I walk up to the trailer. The trailer has a fold down, spring loaded step that boosts you up to the level of the trailer. I step down on it, and insert the pick. I work for no more than 10 seconds before I hear and feel a BANG on the inside of the door. I immediately jump off the step and leave the pick firmly planted in the lock. The guys don't know what happened, but I just said, ""something hit the door from the inside."" So we ran back to the car and left immediately. Back on the highway, we're going 55-60 MPH all the way home.

Ten minutes into the drive, I was sharing my theories on what I think happen. I thought somehow the rabbit climbed through the floor underneath the trailer. Then Jared said something none of us thought of. He said, ""The trailer was padlocked from the outside.. What if there was somebody in the trailer that was tied up and gagged and couldn't yell for help, and all they could do was bang on the sides to ask for help.."" And everyone goes silent. He's in my backseat and I'm looking back at him when suddenly Sean yells, ""DEER DEER DEER DEER DEER!""

Sure enough, I look up and see a deer waiting in the middle of the road... Let me clear something up. Thus far, all of these animals are standing still in front of my car as if waiting for me. They are not walking across the street, they are not stunned by my lights, they're facing my car, either sitting or standing at attention, waiting for me to approach them, and none of them are ever scared of my car... Anyway, I swerve to avoid the deer in the middle of the right lane (my lane) of the two lane highway. I try to slam on the brake and swerve onto the shoulder of the highway, but I accidentally accelerate instead. This deer did not budge one inch until I swerved to my right. Then, it RAN IN MY CAR'S DIRECTION. Like it wanted me to hit him (it was a him, because his antlers were enormous). That acceleration ended up saving our lives. The deer ran in my car's direction, but I sped up to about 75 MPH accidentally and narrowly missed him. I saw him frantically running at my car from my driver's side window, and I swear, I could have reached out and touched him. After that, we collected ourselves, went home, and thought nothing more of the fun night and quick, creepy thrill we got out of the night.
TO BE CONTINUED IN PART 3

...Also, about 3 weeks after this ended, my friend Matt who had been there with me previously said to me, after I told him this story, ""we need to go back and see if the lock pick is still in the lock. To make this story even creepier, when we went back about 2 weeks after this happened, and the lock pick was gone, but the lock was still shut. I searched the ground thinking that maybe a 100 MPH gust of wind appeared out of nowhere and magically took the aluminum foil from inside the padlock, but it wasn't anywhere on the ground. Someone took it off the lock.

I won't say anything to sway your minds, but just to clarify, I live in a city surrounded by rural areas. I've come across many deer, cats, farm animals, and my family has a farm nearby. I know how animals act, and have almost run over a few deer in my time (it's an inevitability here.) But I want you to know, that these animals were not acting normal in case that wasn't clear. Sure, deer MIGHT run at your car the exact second you swerve in that direction, black rabbits that your friends mistake for the size of a small-medium size dog might look like they're leading you somewhere, black cats might appear in your path twice, and be sitting in the middle of the road staring at you, but come on.. if you had been there, you would know how strange they were acting.

As you can see our list of rules is simple but long. Please follow them! They are put there to make sure this does not become r/nosleep. Our members have so far been amazing with their posts and having more people means having a more active community. This also means it could be dangerous for our quality, but I hope not!

We've struggled with this sub floundering before because of lack of members. We had to relax on the rules a bit (like allowing people to post acquaintances' stories, discussions on things that scare them such as number stations, and academically presented legends). These rules are in place to make sure everyone has the ability to post here even if you've never experienced anything first-hand. The tag system ensures the ability to skip over stories that won't interest you.

We also love hearing about ghost hunts and investigations, so keep us posted if you plan on visiting someplace spooky. Even if you don't find anything, we'd still love to hear your preparation and journey and listen to recordings and watch videos. 

We also discourage downvoting. Here is our reason why: we believe every story is valuable and should be archived here. This means some encounters are rather dull. I don't think anyone should be penalized for having a boring experience--the fact you had one is amazing in itself. Please downvote encounters if you believe it is fiction or an exaggeration. This is the easiest method for the moderators to check and remove offending posts. 

You are always welcome to message the mods with any questions, concerns, comments, praise, whatever. We try very hard to make sure everyone is satisfied.

Lastly, please check our archives and start upvoting the ones you like! Many of our wonderful stories were posted when we had a very small community, so we'd like every story to have a chance in our ""Top"" feed, not just the newer ones.

He said before he converted, things happened to him that he could not explain. 

When he was 4, he was a very mild-mannered kid who never spoke to anyone. He was held back in Pre-K for being too antisocial. He was the type of kid who'd construct little high ways for his hot wheels and make them wait at red lights instead of running around and making them fly and explode. He always kept to himself, and his parents never tried to force him to socialize. 

One day his great grandmother came to visit. He's never met her before. He was in the backyard playing, and heard the door open and close. He walked into the house, walked straight up to his great-grandmother, placed his hand on her knee, and with great compassion he said ""Don't worry. It's going to be OK.""
She died that night. Freaked his parents out so badly.

When he was a little older, he would go next door to play. He would hang out with the kid and his family, eat dinner there, and play fun games. It was his first real friend. They played together for years. Parents thought it was cute he had an imaginary friend. My friend was upset. ""he's not imaginary. I've gone to his house. I've met his family. I've seen the inside. I've eaten his food. He's as real as you and I. I can see him, touch him, talk to him and he talks back.""

They moved away maybe a year after the conversation. When my friend turned 15, someone mentioned his imaginary friend and he got angry again. He looked up news paper articles to prove their existence, and found an article about a house next door to him that burned down 14 years prior to them moving in, with a family of 3 stuck inside. Their photos were printed. It was them. He cried. 

Says since he's converted, these things don't happen often. His tribe is terribly pissed because he was incredibly gifted in this. He said now, he can kind of sense when people die, but its very weak. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_sohyy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/sohyy/fr_the_shaman_kid/,

Ive been living in Brighton for about two years now so I'm more or less used to the area and the local happenings. I was walking up a very busy high street to go to the local shopping centre (a shopping mall essentially), and the usual busy crowds of people were making their way on their daily business. However I noticed a man in a wheelchair in the middle of the pavement (sidewalk), not moving. He looked fairly different, shaved head with tattoos on it, sunglasses (it was quite a cloudy day) and a black raggedy blanket covering his legs. However different is normal in Brighton, so I just gathered it to being just another querky Brightonian and carried on past him.

However as I am just about to walk past him, he grabbed my arm. Now I was pretty alarmed, not just because he'd grabbed me out of the blue, but also because theres no way he could've seen me coming up as I didnt see him looking. So it was either he had an eleborate set of mirrors, or just a lucky guess (I guess he could've heard me coming but why me specifically, there were loads of people walking around him, who for some reason didn't take any notice of him).

I looked down at him, not really knowing what was gonna happen. He looked up at me and said ""Please could you push me up to the church?"" He pointed up to the church (which was only 20 metres away and we werent on a hill. He also seemed pretty able so I found it odd), I also noticed he had a large black ring with a crucifix on that kinda stuck out. 

I wasnt really in a rush to get anywhere so I replied ""Y-Yeah sure"", I then began to push him up to the church. When we got to the doorway of the church I stopped and asked him if he needed help with anything else, to which he replied ""No, thank you friend"" he then seemed to lean in and said ""we must always help others before we help ourselves"", I smiled and for some reason thanked him. As I began to walk away, I then turned back and to my disbelief he was gone. Which was ridiculously strange as I had only turned for a few seconds, not nearly enough time for him to move into a place where I couldnt see him. I slowly walked back to where Id left him and looked around,he was no where to be seen, I even looked inside of the church and he wasnt inside. I eventually just shrugged and carrried on about my business.

So yeah, that's my story, sorry if it seemed a bit cliche but I promise you it happened. I kinda regret not finding out a bit about him, but ya'know,I had no idea that was gonna happen.

This is my first post here. I had a question. I tried to research this eerie stuff that happened to me when I was a kid, but couldn't find anything about it. Maybe somebody here can help?
When I was a boy (SW Detroit, 1994) I used to hear this weird heartbeat/pulse and felt this energy coming down the hall every night. And every night, for (I guess) a month, I heard it getting closer. It used to get so loud I had to scream for my parents to come. Then, one night, after the energy was so intense I think the walls were vibrating, this tall, ghostly figure ducked his head and stepped into my room. It looked green and glowing, like it was made of energy. I hid under the covers until it went away.
I never saw it again after that.
I think I've seen ghosts and things like that throughout my life (although I hesitate to use that word because, who knows what they were) but this was unique. Does anyone know what this was?

people who might believe me. This particular post will involve my best friend Jeff, I will let him read over everything before posting these encounters just to make 
sure he is comfortable with the content. This isn't the first time I've encountered strange, unexplainable things in my life and I plan to post more on that at a 
later time.

The most interesting paranormal event concerning Jeff occured during the summer of 2011 while I was out of town. The majority of this even I heard about from Jeff and
had I not participated in two crucial parts I would not believe him. During that summer I was at an internship 1,000 miles away but since we were good friends we talked
on the phone quite often. He started telling me about hearing strange noises in his crawlspace above his garage, (he sat in the garage while on the phone and they keep
their refrigerator in there.) After weeks of hearing these noises he took it upon himself to climb up there and see what sort of animal had made said noises. He was on
the phone with me while he climbed up there. He told me at first that he didn't see anything, he then told me he saw something moving in the corner, then all I heard
was a shout, a crash, and a lot of cursing. Jeff told me he fell out of the crawlspace because something up there ran at him. He said it was too big and sounded more
curious than scared. 

This is his description of what he saw ""It was not quite human and not quite animal in shaped. This thing crawled on all fours like a human but was way too fast. It
was on the smaller side. Only about four feet tall if it were to stand up.""

I thought at first that he was pulling my leg but he kept assuring me that he was telling me the truth, he suddenly said that he thought he wanted to get out of the
garage for a bit and would call back the following evening. During the following weeks Jeff's past time of our conversations was sitting in the garage and staring up at
the crawlspace trying to get a reaction out of whatever was up there. He told me that it was still scratching around occassionally and made some strange gutteral noise
that sounded somewhere between a goat and a cow. He did eventually climb back up there but didn't see the thing though he did find some evidence of something being up
there. This is his description of what he found "" I found where something had been moving some things like boxes and insulation. Slightly into the crawspace I found a 
burnt old scrap of paper with a symbol on it. I had never seen the symbol before and the paper would later disappear without a trace. For along time before and after a wierd sulfer
smell would be coming from there. I checked there was no gas leak and nothing I could connect it to. It seem to just be in the same spot I found the paper.""

He also told me he would hear what sounded like something scratching inside the walls. He heard these noises when sitting in the living room which shared a wall
with the garage and went on to say that he heard the scratching come from the connecting wall. A couple months after this all started up, it stopped completely and has
not reoccurred since.

I only had two personal encounters with this thing, one of which was over the phone. One night as we were on the phone he told me it was making that noise again. This
night he was in his room but could hear it from the garage. So while we were on the phone he walked into the garage, put the phone on speaker, and stood under the crawl
space. I know Jeff did not make this noise because he was in mid-sentence when it cried out. He did it justice by saying it sounded like a combination of a goat and a
cow and something about the noise made my skin crawl even though it was over the phone. The other encounter occured while I was visiting home in the middle of my
internship, I was over at Jeff's and as we were watching a movie in the living room late at night we heard the scratching coming from the garage. I was terrified but
Jeff and I went in there to see what it was. Jeff was about to climb up when I grabbed a broom handle and pushed up against the panel of the crawl space. I pushed it up
2 or 3 inches before I felt pressure on the other side slam it down. Jeff tested the panel himself and couldn't budge it. We left it alone for the rest of the night.

We don't know what it was or what made it go away or what even made it appear in the first place. I understand that the way I presented this might be a bit dry but I just
wanted to state the bare facts without any embellishment. Jeff and I will answer any questions you have and I will tell you more of my experiences with and without Jeff

The poster also made this comment about his story: http://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/wv9jt/gone_fishin/c5gqhog

So I posted a link in the comments in /r/nosleep to his post in /r/libraryofshadows but it gets deleted by the mods, when I message the mods about it they say I need to suspend my disbelief (and they continue to delete my links)... I understand that everything on nosleep is true, but when an author blatantly posts the same story in a fiction subreddit and comments on how he had to change it to pretend its true then I think it should either be removed or readers should have the right to know he is making it up! I get that people saying a story is fake ruins it for others and normally I usually agree with this idea, but I don't in instances like this when the author actually says themselves that it isn't real! I thought the mods would help but they just told me to stop commenting or else... 

So to all you /r/thetruthishere readers I would like your opinion, am I right to be irritated or should ""suspending you belief"" apply to stories even when the author admits it isn't true???

So let's begin..

Some backstory: My great-aunt's sister had been really sick in the hospital for about 2 or 3 weeks at this point and this is what my mom told me. (Right as I was going to fucking bed).

My mom sits at the foot of my bed and says ""honey, M (we'll call my aunt M) just told me something. I'm not sure if you want to hear it right before you go to bed or not. Me being curious already says ""well you mentioned it now so go ahead"". So they were on the phone and my aunt says she was sitting on the screened in porch watching tv. The chair she was sitting in was against the back corner and the tv was right beside the door as soon as you walk in. She says she's sitting there and all of a sudden a dark, black, hooded figure come walking slowly by the door hunched over. She said she caught it as it was just passing the door. She yells ""Charles!, Charles! What are you doing!?"" (That's my uncles name). No response. At this point he had already been in bed for over an hour and has Parkinson's really bad and isn't the one to really mess around like that. She gets up still yelling his name and goes to their room. He's asleep snoring. It wasn't him. They are the only two in the house. She called my mom and told her the story and calmly says, ""I just saw death, it was here to warn me. To prepare me. I just know."" The next morning her sister was pronounced dead. To say the least I didn't get much sleep that night. Anyone else with similar experiences?

He was dying and everyone, incuding him, knew it.  On his death bed he told my mom and grandma that everything was okay.  He had been visited bt a vision of Jesus Christ and knew he was going to a better place.

Up until that point my family viewed church as a social club.  We didn't go in much for the dogma but my parents volunteered a lot.  My grandfather's vision changed that.  He made true believers out of us.  

The following Sunday, several days after his death, the whole family went to church.  Usually my father went alone because he operated the sound system for the church's radio broadcast.  The sound system was in the balcony and so we sat up there to be near my dad.

We came to a point where the pastor lead everyone in the affirmation of faith.   Suddenly in the middle I heard my grandfather's voice, speaking clearly, say ""It's all a lie.""  I heard this out of my right ear.  My grandfather had a distinct voice so it could be noone else. 

 I turned to my right, half expecting to see him sitting there.  Instead I saw my mom, white as a ghost with wide eyes.  ""Did you hear that? Did you hear him?"" She said.  ""Yeah. Was that really him?"" I asked.  She just looked at me. ""Did you hear him say that this is all a lie?"" she asked.

We had both heard him clear and loud.  Neither my grandma nor my father heard it even though they were right next to us.

My grandfather waa a thoughtful and loving man and a hero to many.  I won't go into his long record of service.  My mom and I believe he told them about seeing Jesus to comfort my grandmother, but seeing how hard we fell into the religion he wanted to correct himself and let us know he was still around at the same time.  There were other things that occurred around the same time that made us feel that he was still with us for a while after his death.  Certain smells, dreams I had, things that happened. 

My mother and I found it hard to take church seriously after that and we slowly drifted away from the organization.  

I'm sure it was my grandfather and he was telling us the truth.  His statement would be corroborated several years later....",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1h769e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1h769e/mefam_its_all_a_lie/,

**THE ORIGINAL POST:**

Several days ago, I watched the film ""The Mothman Prophecies"", a film based on real encounters with a moth-like creature in Point Pleasant, WV during the 60s. It's a film I've seen many times, and I actually first discovered the Mothman stories in a book called ""Creatures From UFOs"" that was in the library at the elementary school I grew up attending years ago.

There's a scene where the main character has a phone conversation with an Indrid Cold, which many believe to be an alias the entity used. 

So, I find the clip [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlMnpVCUdtE) and decided to post it on Reddit, right [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/zc5o4/conversation_with_indrid_cold_the_mothman/)

Now, I go back to the Youtube page and notice something interesting in the comments...

There's a user by the name of Indrid Cold responding to various users. So, for shits and giggles, I decide to start a conversation with him.

[This](http://imgur.com/lyyIV) is the first bit of back and forth on the comments wall. From there, the conversation strictly became PMs. And also reached another level of [freaky](http://imgur.com/agZPT). I decided to ask a [straightforward question](http://imgur.com/gFesT), to which his reply left me a bit [intrigued](http://imgur.com/txkSU), but I was still pretty skeptical. So then I asked him [what pet I had in my hand](http://imgur.com/s9dT5). [(My pet, Korra)](http://imgur.com/elyK7). This was his [response](http://imgur.com/sTByu). 

I couldn't ask anything else. Between everything I've read, the movie, and this, it creeped me out. None of my personal info is online, and if it is, it is locked so that only friends can see it. 

Later on, I showed my friend. He looked up the user name and pointed out that his account appears as if it had never been used. No comments, no views...nothing. 

Maybe someone's fucking with me, or maybe I encountered Indrid Cold...Anyone West Virginia folks/ Mothman experts that could chime in on my experience?

**PART 2:**

Reddit,

About 5 days ago, I made a post about a freaky conversation I had with an Youtube user named ""Indrid Cold"". If you haven't read that post, you can read it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zkt8m/i_had_a_conversation_with_a_man_i_believe_to_be/)

Now, in the youtube feed yesterday, I had a small back and forth with another user about what was happening. They had PMed Indrid Cold as well, and received an unsettling response. 

Earlier today, I received a new message from Indrid, and it is possibly the creepiest message he's sent yet. For various reasons, the images I  will share have been censored. [Part 1](http://imgur.com/a/1ME8s#0) [Part 2](http://imgur.com/a/1ME8s#1)

Not long after that, the Youtube/Reddit user I had communicated with previously sent me this [PM](http://imgur.com/a/1ME8s#2).

I asked this user to [email](http://imgur.com/a/1ME8s#3) exactly what Indrid had sent them. 

...At this point, I was so worried, that I tried communicating with my sister about it. I sent her the photos I had taken, and she couldn't explain it. She also doesn't believe it...

Not too sure what to think of it myself, but several things in that rather long message were things I had not told anyone. 

As for my brother...I have not contacted him. Not that I wouldn't want to save him if there's indeed danger coming, but that I'm Christian and I don't like the idea of taking control of destiny. It freaks me out.

I feel like I'm going crazy...are there any other Redditors out there who messaged Indrid, and believe me? 

**PART 3:**

Hey Guys,

For those who have kept up, I just wanted to thank you if you truly believe that something super natural has been at work here. The Mothman and Indrid Cold phenomenons have been a personal interest to me for over a decade, and to partially quote Richard Gere's character from the film, it's almost like this entity knew I was interested, zeroed in, and was like ""Ah, there you are!""

Indrid has not communicated with me in a few weeks. What I will do is update you up to the latest message I sent, Including the response I initially refused to share. 

If you haven't read parts 1 and 2, Part 1 is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zkt8m/i_had_a_conversation_with_a_man_i_believe_to_be/) and Part 2 is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zuxad/heres_an_update_on_my_conversations_with_indrid/)

I will post an album of the back and forth communication, beginning with where I left off previously. I did censor my last name for privacy reasons, and I left out one back and forth where I asked Indrid to tell one of my friends things about his family I wouldn't know to prove I wasn't making this up (which he did to shocking accuracy and disturbed my friend a bit).

He's our [back and forth](http://imgur.com/a/10UrQ#0)

Indrid has not responded in a few weeks. He says he'll always be there, but I think he will choose the time to respond. I think I'm done talking about Indrid Cold

As I said in the previous story, the incidents that occurred at my parents house got stranger and creepier the older I got. I already told you my first encounter....now I'll tell you what I believe was my second experience...it's hard to remember the order of occurrence.

Being the youngest of five, both my parents worked and at one point all my brothers and sisters were at school 30 min longer than myself.(they were in middle and high school, I was in elementary school) So for a good 30 min I would be alone in the house. (except for my little pomeranian dog who kept me company) I want to say I was in 5th grade.  

Now I know this story sounds ridiculous. and yes, it is. But true. I'm not bullshitting...no reason to.  Alright so I am home alone this school day. Once I got home I always liked to get out of my school clothes and into like sweats or something. So I was undressing then realized I had to take a dump...so I went to one of our bathrooms in just my underwear at this point because i couldn't hold it.  I'm sitting there taking care of business and then I notice the toilet paper roll started spinning on its own, leaving a pile of toilet paper on the ground. For some reason I just stared at the roll and let it all empty out on the floor. I think I was just so amazed/creeped out that I couldn't stop it.  right after the whole roll emptied out, I heard a noise. Creepiest noise ever. (i should probably note that the bathroom is right next to the basement door)

I heard the sound of moaning. Like a zombie kind of moaning.  Seriously straight from a zombie movie kind of moaning.  I kept telling myself that this wasn't possible and I was just hearing things. Then I heard a slow foot step on the basements first step. then to the second, then the third. Whatever it was was coming up the stairs.  I then began to tear up and didn't know what to do. 

Then, I heard a second moaning from the same floor I'm on. It was in the back of the house in a girls voice. It was getting louder so I knew it was coming closer as well. I opened the bathroom door, (still sitting on the toilet, crying hysterically at this point) and I can see halfway down the house from that point. I see my pomeranian dog in the kitchen barking and growling very aggressively at absolutely nothing. He was just standing there ready to pounce, following something with his eyes, growling like a wild animal(this dog never ever gets aggressive/growls etc)  Clearly he sees  and hates whatever is walking toward me. Quickly I had to decide whether to run and grab my dog or just run out. At this point the male moaning from the basement is almost at the door. I had no more time. I had to run outside without my dog. this made me cry even more cuz I was afraid they were going to hurt him. 

So there I was, maybe 10 or whatever sitting on my parents porch, in the middle of winter with probably 6 inches of snow, in only my underwear.I was just sitting there crying hysterically at what I had just experienced. I no longer heard the noise from outside and my dog was not barking.  

My mom came home, roughly 30 min afterwards and saw me sitting on the porch, basically naked, freezing to death. She screamed ""What are you doing!?"" 

I said, ""I can't go in there! There are ghosts trying to get me!""
Now of course, my mom is thinking i'm a crazy person, and honestly I think most of my family thought that originally because they seemed to pick on me the most. But as time went on, they all experienced something paranormal, perhaps worst than I ever experienced.

We went back inside and there was nothing. My dog was just chillin as if nothing happened. It was a relief but also left me very very confused at what just happened.

When I think about what happened that night, I believe the ghosts were trying to scare me on purpose. Why else would they do the stereotypical moaning sound? What do you guys think? anything like this ever happen to you?

TL;DR I was home alone pooping, toilet paper roll spins itself empty on its own. something was moaning and coming from the basement up the stairs, another girl moaning from the same floor as myself. dog barks and growls hysterically at absolutely nothing and I run outside in only underwear in the winter crying until parents come home",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_19st5n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/19st5n/haunted_childhood_pt2/,

The people I’ve told it to have encouraged me to post my story, and albeit long – I hope you guys will appreciate it. 

My dad lives on top of an old pub – in the northern part of Sydney, Australia. The pub’s been there since the 1930s, but prior to that (we later found out), it was housing commission. We moved into the pub when I was about 13, back when my mum and dad were still together. From the moment we moved in things were never quite right. As a young person, I feel like I was really in tune with whatever was going on in the house – the noises and the feelings I used to get in there never really bothered me, but I was very aware of what was happening.
 
Something consistent about this house was that every night, at about 11 or 12 o’clock, there was knocking on my bedroom wall – right next to my head. It was just after they’d closed up the pub, and things were quiet and the staff had all left. I’d be drifting off to sleep and then…knock, knock, knock. I sometimes went into my parent’s room and made them come in when I heard the knocking – but for some reason it never used to happen when they came in, and by the time I went and got them, the knocking had stopped. They managed to convince me it was just ‘the pipes’, which never made sense to me, but it was enough for me to accept the nightly ritual without being scared out of my wits.
 
One day, I had a sleepover with two of my friends. We were all huddled in bed, about to go to sleep and like clockwork, the knocking started. It was just three straight knocks to begin with, and my friends freaked out immediately. I calmed them down, telling them “It’s just the pipes”, so once they’d calmed down, they decided to experiment. One of the girls knocked on the wall – that famous beat “knock knock knock knock knock” and then out of nowhere, almost immediately, the end of the famous beat was heard through our side of the wall “knock knock”. We obviously shit ourselves, and that leads to my next part of the story – investigating the knocking. 
A few days after the knocking incident I decided to speak to the hotel licensee, to see what information I could gather about not only the hotel, but neighbours – which is what I had brought it down to after the incident. To my surprise, the licensee told me that no neighbours had lived in the next door apartment for over 10 years – it was simply the upstairs of the deli that was next door. This creeped me out big time. On top of the knocking, I had started to notice other things about the house as well. 
The only good way to explain the blueprint of this small apartment is to imagine the accommodation you would find if you stayed at a hotel. It’s a long corridor, with rooms off either side and a large dining area on the right, with my room right at the end of the hall. If I were sitting in the living area (which realistically would have used to be a room rented out to travelers), I would sometimes hear a distinct marble sound rolling down the corridor, like someone is playing in the hallway. The first couple of times it happened I ignored it, but the marble sound became more frequent. This continued until I was in my late teens.
Throughout all these instances of noises and knocking, we never had any huge problems with these ‘ghosts’. But that all changed when my parents divorced, and one late night in house all alone. 
A friend and I were celebrating the end of school. We were 18, and out on the town partying with friends. My parents were both overseas at the time; my mum has moved out and was away in Queensland, and my Dad was in America. We had the whole house to ourselves. We were having a fab time, but both had commitments the next day, so we toddled on home about 11 o’clock and headed to bed. Lill and I both slept in the same bed and pretty much fell asleep straight away. 
The next thing I remember is waking up, feeling scared and cold and looking up into the dark where I could see Lillian, sitting up, wide awake next to me in bed. 
“Are you OK?” she asked, looking at me, pale as anything, eyes wide.
“Sure,” I said, “What’s going on?”
She gulped. “I can’t believe you didn’t wake up until now. I’ve been hearing things for an hour”.
“What kind of things?”
“Oh God, I don’t know. Magazines being dropped, books being pushed over. Scrapes on the floor.”
Just at that minute we both heard a tremendous bang at my bedroom door. Not at the front door, at the BEDROOM door. We screamed insanely loudly and I hid under the covers. As we sat under the safety of the blanket we could hear the pitter patter of feet along the echoing corridor, running away from my bedroom door that was just knocked on. I had begun to cry.
Lillian was a strong girl, never frightened by a thing. When I started to cry she simply pushed back the sheets and sat up fiercely, opened her mouth and screamed:
“GET THE FUCK OUT. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE. LEAVE US THE FUCK ALONE. YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE. LEAVE!”
I was in shock. Terrified that something would happen and make the situation worse, I cried even harder. For a few minutes, the house was silent. No creaks were heard. No knocks were knocked. No breaths were had. Lillian and I sat upright in bed, expecting the worst, awaiting the storm after the calm.
A few seconds later, heavy footsteps bashed the floorboards of the corridor outside my room, it reached the front door, and then stopped. We sat back in relief, reflecting on the surreal situation that had just happened. 
The next morning, Lillian and I awoke, finally leaving the bedroom to inspect the damage. As we entered the living room, a whirlpool of newspapers, magazines and books cluttered the floors – pages ripped, magazines torn in a frenzy. Shaking, we picked up the mess and collated the torn shreds, binning them or putting them back into place. The house was cold, and dark. Lillian began telling me her version of what happened the night before.
She began by telling me she woke up to the sound of books being dropped, like she said in bed that night. What she didn’t tell me at the time, was that right before I woke up, she saw a black figure walking into the room. She explained that the figure leant over me for a few seconds, right before I woke up.
I was sweating. What did this figure want? Why was it leaning over me? Why did it want me? I was terrified by the thought of what this thing wanted from me and decided right then and there I was not going to stay at the house anymore until my dad returned from overseas. 
Shortly after this incident, a gathered a group of people I was close to, 3 of my best friends, and invited them over to help with the situation. Under the influence of these friends (including Lillian, who was present on the night of the incident), we decided to conduct a séance. At 18, I really didn’t know much about what can happen during these Ouija board sessions, and now that I do, I can assure all of you I would never be involved in one again. This was a horrifying, gut-wrenching experience for all of us that I know I’ll never escape.
One night, the four of us sat down at my dining table. We had created our own Ouija board, printing off letters, numbers and the words ‘Yes’ and ‘No’. We scattered them around the edge of our square table and placed a small glass in the middle that we would inevitably place our hands on in hope of it moving. We dimmed the lights, lit some candles, turned off everything electronic. And then we waited.
As the homeowner, I spoke first. “Is there anyone else in the room with us tonight?” 
No answer. We all looked at one another for answers, shrugged and tried again. I cleared my throat and spoke a little louder. “Is there anyone else in the room with us tonight?”
A minute went by and still no response. I was beginning to feel nervous by this point as I didn’t understand why the séance wasn’t working. I looked at Lillian, who was sitting to my right, and noticed she had gone a whiter shade of pale. She was staring intently at the corner of the room. As I looked over to see where she was staring, the candle in the middle of our table flickered, then blew out completely – like someone had just leant over and blown it out. Naturally, we all freaked out, but that was nothing compared to what followed.
All of a sudden Lillian started laughing, giggling in a maniacal way. I kept staring at her (the room was still kept alight by the other candles in the room) and she just couldn’t stop laughing. I was shaking her hands and trying to pull her out of this weird spell or whatever she was under. But she just wouldn’t stop. This went on for about 40 seconds and then she stopped immediately, and a shadow passed on the wall – nothing specific, like a human that I could immediately identify, but it freaked us out none the less. Then they started to talk.
Lillian, acting calm and like nothing unusual had just happened, placed her hand on the glass and said: “Tell us who you are”. 
We all placed our hands on the glass in hope of a response. After about 15 seconds, we began to feel a strange pulling sensation towards the lower corner of the table. It pulled down to the left, then to the top, back to the bottom, and the top again. We sounded out the letters as they were touched. S – A – R – A.
“Sara”
Lillian continued. “How old are you Sara?” The glass beneath our fingertips moved in slow, timid-like crawl over the ‘5’. We were making progress. Lill got straight to the point that we were trying to achieve. “Sara, are you the person who was in brownpaperbag91’s room the other night?” 
Sara had obviously begun to gain confidence. We removed our fingers from the glass and watched in awe as it slid towards the ‘No’. It then moved toward the middle of the table. Lillian pressed forward. 
“Can you tell us who it was then?”
The glass made a quick turn from its usual timid movements and bolted toward the ‘No’ once again. We looked at one another with trepidation. Without questions or hesitation, the glass turned towards ‘Goodbye’, and that was that. 
 Without thinking, I opened my mouth, “Is there anyone else here?”
The glass made a slide towards the yes, our hearts beating out of our chests with both fright and anticipation. The glass slid around the table with ease, from R, to I, C and H. Before it could reach the A, Lillian said quietly: “Richard”.
A more confident glass moved towards the ‘Yes’, as we sat back and waited.
“Are you the person who was in my room last night?”
A short glide to the yes. 
“What do you want? Why are you here?”
A quick slide to the no. 
We glanced around at one another, waiting for the next move. Lillian randomly burst out, “Richard, do you like me?”
This next part gives me goosebumps.
The small glass we have on the table slid so sharply to the word ‘NO’ it slid completely off the table, and shattered to pieces. I screamed, which broke the entire séance and immediately we heard footsteps running down our corridor, deep thuds that were scarily similar to that of the night of the incident. In an attempt to calm us down, my other friend made us sink back into the chairs. We had to close the gate that we opened for the séance or things might never improve. I wanted to be back in my bed so bad, and so we had to finish what we started. 
Lillian grabbed my hand, and I grabbed the person next to me, and so on. We created a circle, while Lillian shouted “It’s time for you to go! It’s time for you to go!” over and over again. The candles began to go out one by one, I was crying my eyes out and then all of a sudden, after what seemed like 10 minutes – it stopped. We sat in darkness, silently weeping in fear.
Finally, after we’d gathered ourselves, I stood up to turn on the lights. To my horror, the hatch the attic (which was right above our heads) had been opened. It was only slightly lifted off, pushed to the side. I lost my shit. Dean, one of the friends who was there at the time, reached up and put it back into place, but I never took it any further than that. There was no way I was going up there. 

So that’s my story. If you have any questions or want to know any more, just PM me. I hope you found this just as intriguing as a lot of my friends who’ve heard the story.

 About six years ago I was dating my bestfriend's sister, so I was almost always staying the night at their
Dad's house on the weekends with them. they ended up moving into a new house that the family owned for a 
long while. Any time I was invited over I would get a weird feeling to not want to go, which is weird because
even before I started dating his sister I was over at the old house all the time. Just something in my gut told me
not to go to the new house. After a couple times saying no, his sister was pretty much begging me to come 
over, so I reluctantly went.

 The first couple times I stayed I had an uneasy feeling but nothing horrible, just your usual ""bad feeling"". 
After that things got weird, I started sleeping in the basement because the spare bed room was now being used 
as storage. during the nights I slept down there I was hearing voices at night and it would wake me up, now I'm 
a super heavy sleeper, like stupid heavy. I have to set three alarms in three different areas, on full blast, to go 
off just to get me to wake up.so it usually takes a lot to wake me. But these voices were very quiet if you could
imagine less than a whisper, that's how quiet, but it would wake me completely like someone was shaking and
screaming to wake me up. At first I didn't remember what they were saying just noise. Then a couple weekends 
later I started hearing them ""less than a whisper"" my first name. I never told anybody because I didn't know what 
they would think.
    
 The last night I stayed in the basement was the worst. I had a horrid feeling in my gut that night going down 
stairs, but I pushed past it and went to bed, once again I heard the ""less than a whisper"" of my name, I woke up 
eyes half open and immediately shut my eyes from fear. Above my bed, like straight above my head, was some 
thing dangling from the ceiling looking down at me. I don't remember what it looked like because I was so scared. 

 That was it I had enough I ran up stairs and soon as I went through the doorway I heard a sharp blood 
curdling scream, loud enough to put off car alarms. It was about 3 a.m. and something that loud should have 
woke everyone in the house. But nobody came out of their rooms, I didn't sleep the rest of the night. 


 That morning I asked if anybody heard the scream, of course  nobody had a clue of what I was talking about. 
Her step mom saw that I was obviously shaken up still and asked what was wrong, I decided to tell them what 
has been happening, all the whispers everything down to that night. 

 The step mom started crying at this point, because she said has had the same things happening to her when
they first moved in, right until I started staying there. She then said that it just stopped cold turkey little did 
she know it was passed onto me somehow. I asked her if she ever saw anything like I had, she was bawling at 
this point and said yes she in her words described a girl dangling from her feet from the ceiling with what looked 
like dried blood all over and as she described it a face that had a smile like a porcelain  clown doll. 


 About a week later their dad was forced, from the step mom, to move out of the house, at which point they 
found out the dad's great grand father built the house for his wife using money that he acquired from pretty 
much killing his mother and taking all her savings. I never went back to that house again, and I believe the 
grandpa has since sold it.

My cousin and I were going for a drive down a canyon, near town. The road winds against the mountains to the right and there is a small gulch to the left, which has a river which is pretty overgrown with trees. Anyway, as we were driving, my cousin yelled, ""dude, what is that?!"" 
""what?""
""What the hell is that on the hill?! Is it a rock? Look, right there, going downhill, kicking up dust!""
""I don't-""
""Holy SHIT! That thing just took out a tree!""
Then I realized that he wasn't talking about the mountain ahead of us, but the one right next to us (which was still sort of in front). I never expected that he was seeing something so close. We talked about it, and he said he thought it was a rock rolling down the hill at first, but then it looked like a man running, and he ran into a tree and knocked it over, meanwhile, falling, himself. 

I immediately told him to turn around, so we could get back to the place where he saw it, and, now that I knew where to look, we both saw this tall figure, in regular caucasian-tan skin color. A group of trees obscured the view for a second and it was gone. The color was so light in contrast to the rest of the landscape that we were sure we would see it again, but could not. So, we stopped the car and jumped out, putting together that we had, in fact, seen the same 15 foot tall pale shape. When we got out, we stopped and listened. Over the babbling of the little river, we heard what most people describe to be bigfoot's call. It was a deep rumbling roar that kind of came out in coughs like a lion's roar. We waited and it didn't happen again, meaning it wasn't the river. There were no other people or machines in the area, and we haven't seen it since.


EDIT: I should add that part of the hill had burned by a forest fire a few years ago, and the tree my cousin saw fall was a burned, dead one that may or may not have already been fallen and was leaning against another tree.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1k8p62,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1k8p62/me_the_naked_giant/,
1364261956.0,56,self.Thetruthishere,1b0ixw,My Family's Experience with Skinwalkers.  ,redheadedalex,63,7,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1b0ixw/my_familys_experience_with_skinwalkers/,"To start with, I am a white female.  I was adopted seven years ago by a Navajo family and we've always been close despite obvious cultural differences.  Still, I learned about skinwalkers firsthand and they've since become an accepted part of my life.  I left Utah at the end of 2012 and was surprised to see enthusiasm on Reddit for skinwalker stories.  I have a ton of them, but I will start off with a few and see if people want to hear more.  

The first happened to my adopted uncle.  He was driving through the canyon area (they live in Blanding, Utah, a spot not quite notorious for skinwalkers, but full of them nonetheless) at night and got that familiar feeling.  It was dark outside, but the moon illuminated the canyon and brush enough for him to see out of his side vision that something was running across the desert night.  He was in his 40's at the time, and a police officer, so a full-grown man.  He started singing/praying in Navajo and kept his eyes on the road in front of him.  But he was driving at least 55-60 MPH so the shape running through the desert was keeping pace with him despite his high speed.  He said that it looked vaguely human-shaped, but paler than any human he'd ever seen.  Still, he didn't look directly at it.  And despite his singing he was getting more and more scared.  One thing my Navajo family always taught me was that these creatures feed on your fear.  This one certainly seemed to.   My uncle was shaking and sweating when the running 'thing' picked up speed, outpacing his truck, and then when it was maybe thirty yards ahead of him, it made a sharp right and began to run toward the road.  He knew it was going to directly intersect him and he made up his mind to put his foot on the gas, because being braked out in the middle of that road in the dark alone was a death sentence.  So, it got closer, he sped up, and just as the two crossed paths, it jumped onto the road.  

So he saw it for the first time then.  He described it as a skinny man in jeans and a plaid shirt (typical res wear) with a long face and big yellow eyes that looked like cat eyes.  It's arms were thrown up over its head and its hands were kind of flying out behind it.  The worst part was that its mouth was open and seemed to be disconnected from its jaw, its chin was just flapping around about a foot below its ""nose"".  It leapt onto the road and then just as quickly jumped out of the way of his truck, and he didn't see it again.  He prayed the whole way home and they had a ceremony shortly after that.  


Another encounter happened to my adopted brother, who is one of the most level-headed and unshakeable men I've ever met.  He was 30 when this happened.  He was at their Dad's house, partaking in one of these ceremonies, which happens in a hogan.  The rule is that you never leave the hogan alone, because the magic and energy that you make during those ceremonies is kind of like a supernatural light beacon, and you never know what kind of creatures you're attracting.  Still, Eric, my brother, was a pretty rational guy and wasn't afraid of the dark.  He'd been in the hogan for hours, chanting and praying and all that good stuff, and he needed a smoke break and to take a leak.   So against the general rule, he edged out of the roundhouse and out into the night.  There was nothing around except fifteen or twenty parked cars, all close to the ceremony area.  It was a large gathering.  So Eric did his business with no incident, and lit up a cigarette.  He was standing there staring off into space when he got that feeling of being watched.  To shake it off, he walked away from the hogan, about twenty feet, and scanned the desert.  Everything was quiet, except the drums coming from the tent and the singing within.  Just as he was about to shrug off his weird feeling and chuck his cigarette butt, he saw it: under one of the vehicles, a dark shape and two shining eyes.  The eyes were like animal eyes.  They didn't glow on their own, but they had reflective light in them, and they glinted right at Eric.  They were yellow.

The creature didn't have the shape of any animal he recognized though; he explained it to me that it ""was shaped like Gollum, really skinny with a round human head.""  Eric, not scared of something that would make me shit my pants instantly, walked toward the vehicle and bent down to get a closer look.  Dust scrabbled around and he could hear a skittering noise.  One bony arm shoved some gravel his way and the next thing he knew, the creature was gone and the vechile was empty.  But then he smelled this disgusting, puke-worthy stench, and he got scared then, because that's one of the worst things in the Navajo culture....bad smells are treated very seriously (when they're assumed to be supernatural.)  

So he straightened back up and then he realized the source of the smell.  A shadow fell over him--covering him from behind--and he is around 6'2'' so this thing he said he estimated at 7.5 feet at least.  He was shivering and didn't move as it approached him from behind, until it was standing inches away.  He could feel it, smell it, see its shadow, and then the worst thing: he felt it breathe on his neck.  Eric said that it sounded like a horse or cow when it snorts, and its breath was warm.  When he looked at his feet, he saw his own shoes, and behind his right foot, a big hoof.  

So he closed his eyes and started to sing, and right at that moment his dad and uncle got a terrible feeling from inside the hogan.  They bolted up and exited, calling his name.  They found him shivering outside, too terrified to talk and too terrified to stop singing in Navajo.  It took Eric months before he shared this with us and he did so expecting us to laugh or call him crazy.  But I completely believe his story.

Now, mind you I was a relatively calm child, reading Anne of Green Gables and the occasional myth or ghost story, but I wasn't really in to spooks and monsters and whatnot. I was a nerdy glasses-girl who just loved to read and hike.

We had been in our house a year or two with only a vague feeling of worry regarding the basement and my closet/under my bed crossing my mind, but somehow I knew even as a child that most kids were afraid of such things so it wasn't weird.

One evening, though, things were very different. My entire family had gone to bed, my brother across the hall from me and my parents in the bedroom next door. As we were settling in I heard something moving around downstairs. It sounded like something sliding around on the carpets. The dogs were upstairs so there was nothing to be making that noise. Anyway, I was sure if it was truly weird my parents or brother would say something, because it was very loud.

But as I settled in, I heard the steps squeak, like something had walked up them one step. Except I heard something else go *thump* after that step. So it was like *squeak**thump*. And it was going very slowly, as if it was having a hard time climbing the stairs.

Nobody was saying anything, so I called out to my parents ""Do you know what's on the stairs?""

""There's nothing on the stairs, go to sleep.""

""But I hear something coming up the stairs and it's thumping around!"" I told them.

They ignored me.

""I can hear it coming! Can you just check??"" I pleaded.

""GO TO SLEEP."" was the only reply.

At this point I was very scared because this thing was VERY loud, but it seemed like my parents couldn't hear it or didn't care.

I heard the thing get to the top of the stairs and pause, and I swear I heard wheezing. The as I listened I heard it come down the hall, slowly again, one step at a time.

""MOM! I can hear it in the hallway now! It's coming down here!"" I hollered.

""GO TO SLEEP NOW!"" my mom hollered back. Then my brother added in ""Shut UP! You're getting me scared over your stupid story!""

And that's when I realized he couldn't hear it either, or maybe he sensed something was there but had brushed it off until I said something...? We'll never know.

Realizing it had started walking again after I was done calling out, I hid under my sheets and listened as it stopped at my doorway, breathing wheezily, then came in to my bed, with something sliding along the carpet.

It sounded awful and wet and at this point I realized it was on level with me hiding in my bed, so it was also short. I was so scared I hid there for what seemed like forever with this thing right up next to the bed, breathing and staring at me.

""MOM! IT'S IN HERE!!"" I hollered.

""ONE MORE WORD AND YOU'RE GROUNDED. Dad will come in there and spank the daylights out of you!"" (this was back before hitting kids was horribly taboo and frowned upon).

Thus threatened, I crunched together in a ball of tightened muscles, trying to hold my breath, feeling whatever the thing was staring at me through the sheet I had over my head for protection.

Finally, unable to stand it, I rolled over and took the sheet off my head to see what was staring at me.

I so wish I had not. I so wish I'd let myself get stressed to the point of passing out.

Standing at eye level (my bed was on a riser and I had to climb up to get in to it) was something with no hair on it, a huge, oval-shaped head and a body covered with blotches of grey, purple, black and dark blue as of the entire body had been bruised and kicked about without an inch of flesh spared.

The face itself was just round, with two very small, dark eyes like black marbles seeming set IN to the flesh, no eye sockets or anything. The mouth was lopsided, like a slash, and when it opened it (no lips, by the way, just the slash) there were a few grey, ground down and rounded teeth spaced out.

The worst part, besides the completely inhuman and penetrating stare from those marble eyes, was when I realized what had been thumping on the stairs and sliding across the carpet. One hand appeared ""normal"". The other, though, was so horribly deformed that I don't even remember what the normal hand looked like. Its right hand was a huge, deformed lump of the same bruise-riddled skin with no fingers visible. It was so heavy it pulled the right shoulder of the thing down so the hand dragged on the ground. The lump itself was so large that it didn't have to lean that far, however. it was easily the size of a softball, dangling from an arm equivalent to that of a 5 year old child.

In fact, for a second I wondered if it WAS a child, but it looked so horrible and FELT so horrible, I immediately dismissed the idea.

After a moment I couldn't handle it so I scooted as far from the edge of the bed where the *thing* was and ended up touching the wall my bed was up against. I turned away from it, pulled ALL of the blankets over my head -including the decorative blanket from my grandmother that was apparently only for draping across the end of the bed- and buried myself underneath.

Between the stress of my heart pounding and sweating from all of the blankets in the late spring, I eventually passed out.

I lived in fear for days that the thing would return, feeling as if it was around but I just couldn't see it. I would close my door every night after my parents went to bed, and I swear one night I heard the thumping followed by a scratching at my door. But I never physically saw the thing again in my youth.

Fast forward 18 years when I am on the other side of the country and talking with a friend who is very in to the paranormal. I'm spending the evening at her house when, for some reason, this story pops in to my head for the first time in years. I tell her about it, she shudders, then we get on with talking about other things.

later that night she is in the guest room and every light is on in the house. She shakes me awake, then says ""Dude, that thing? That thing is in the living room. The cats are freaking out with it around. It's yours, get rid of it.""

I hoped she was just dreaming, so I went downstairs.... except there it was, in the middle of the lights, in the corner by the front door like it couldn't move any further in (she wards the HELL out of her house at all times).

I had no idea what to do with it so I asked ""why are you here?""
It just stared at me with those same eyes. I felt something wiggle through my brain like it was trying to answer, but nothing came of it.

""You have to leave, you're not welcome here,"" I told it.

Its head dropped when I said that, and it slowly faded away.

The worst part about that is, even though I got verification that I wasn't imagining things, it still exists and it's out there somewhere. I'm scared it'll come bumping up the steps to scare my kids some day. :(",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_19yaxk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/19yaxk/me_something_from_childhood/,

She wants hard proof before she'll believe in ghosts or anything spiritual. So when she told me this story, I knew it wasn't to pull my leg. 

In my town there is a house on the corner of a street that has been abandoned for 15 or so years now. The previous owners left in the middle of the night and they've refused to sell the house. It's an old Victorian house that was once a beautiful blue color is now faded into a slate gray. Well, what's left of the paint as most of it has been peeled off. The grass has obviously grown around it although the city tries to maintain it the best they can to keep the street value decent. We don't have any legends of the house such as someone dying or murdering people. 

I never really questioned why the owners left. Hell, my town is incredibly small so many people leave and don't come back but do keep their house here. It's kind of their roots in a way. I don't think anyone ever questioned why the owners left. 

However, I remember one day in particular that I was with my mom and we drove passed the house. I was thinking out loud and asked what her theory was on why the people left in the middle of the night. I expected her to come up with some crazy off the wall story. Instead,  my mom gripped the steering wheel so tight her knuckles turned white. Her face became ashen and she didn't answer until we were well passed the house. 

We pulled up into our driveway and she turned to me. She had the most serious look on her face and she said ""If I tell you this story, you will be the first person I ever told."" Her story was this: 

She was babysitting when she was 15-16 with her best friend Becky. They had babysat a lot of neighborhood kids and when they got a call from the family (she couldn't remember their last name but she thought it was Richards) they decided to babysit there. 

The Richards had two children, Anna (2) and Jackson (4) and since the kids were so young, they shared a room togehter. My mom and Becky met Mr. and Mrs. Richards before and they seemed like a wonderful family. 

It was about 11:00 P.M. and both kids were upstairs fast asleep. My mom and Becky were watching movies (nothing scary as they are both chickens-more movies like Old Yeller and things of that sort.) Suddenly, they both heard a noise from upstairs in the children's room. 

They figured one of the kids had woken up and went to go check. When they got there, both of the kids were fast asleep and there didn't seem anything amiss. They kind of shrugged it off and went back down the stairs to finish their movie. 

About 10 minutes later, they heard something again. They ran back up the stairs and once again, the kids were fast asleep in their beds. They began looking around for what could be making the noise and couldn't find anything. They were about to walk out of the room when they heard the noise behind them. They turned around and the children's toys started being thrown at the wall. The toys were being flung 5-7 feet with force. Both of the kids were asleep. 

My mom and Becky ran and grabbed both the kids, ran down the stairs and out of the house until their parents got home. When their parents did finally get home, they told them what happened. When Mr. Richards went upstairs, all of the toys were picked up and nothing was wrong. They obviously didn't believe my mom or Becky. 

Now since I wasn't there, I can't say this story 1000% happened but I do believe my mom due to the look on her face. The story sure scared me, thought I might as well share it.

After my husband and I married, his parents asked us if we would like to move into their rental house. My husband lived there when he attended college, and since it was inexpensive and I was going to school full-time, we accepted.

Before moving in, and knowing my previous experiences, my husband warned me the house was haunted by an entity who he felt was a female. He told me he would wake often in the middle of the night feeling the weight of someone sitting on the bed or he would wake up feeling someone caressing his hair. I was a little hesitant because I did not want to get into some weird supernatural love triangle, but I gave it a go. Other than the usual antics (things being moved, the occasional tap on the shoulder, etc.), I was pretty confident the situation would work out.

One night around one month after we moved in, my husband and I came home from a night of partying (yes, we drank heavily that night). We immediately went to bed and promptly passed out. Perhaps an hour later we both heard a very loud shriek that was undoubtedly from a female.  My husband and I simultaneously sat up in bed and asked each other if indeed we both heard the same thing. We had.

Just at that moment, we heard our trash can full of recycling (i.e. beer cans from our housewarming party) dump over onto the concrete floor making a very loud noise. The trash can was located in our back room. We turned on the light and listened. My husband got up and looked to the back room, but didn’t turn on the light. Being a little inebriated, we decided to leave the mess for the morning and went back to sleep.

The next morning I awoke to the horror that someone had been trying to break in to the house while we slept. The back door that led to the carport had one of those deadbolts that can be only be opened on both sides with a key. Since we did not have a key, we never used it. The person had removed the glass slats in the door first, and upon realizing the deadbolt could not be opened from the inside, had drilled out the deadbolt. We figure when the person finally opened the door, our unseen roommate knocked over the trash can, waking us up, and scaring off the burglar.

After that experience, I was a little more inclined to listen to what our personal protector had to say as my husband and I are convinced she tried to warn us about the break-in. Whenever she clearly did not like someone she would “lock” them in the bathroom. If someone was drinking heavily she would hide their car keys. I guess you could say she was the best kind of roommate.

Several people, both from our housekeeping and others who have tried opening businesses there, have reported hearing a girl's voice trying to get their attention when they are back in the kitchen area. 

One maid, back when we used part of the restaurant to prep the continental breakfast, mentioned seeing a girl in her late teens/early 20's, dressed in white, walking past her into an adjoining room.  When she turned to tell the girl we weren't open yet, the girl had vanished.

A large 3x4' painting in the dining room area had a tendency to lift up and off of the 2 large hooks it was hung on and end up in the middle of the floor.  This happened a half-dozen times before I removed the painting and tossed it into a storage room (I'm not fond of having to investigate loud crashing sounds in the middle of the night).

Once (and thankfully only once), I had a can of soda start to slide slowly down a long counter towards me while I was reading in a side office.  I remember being completely frozen for a long moment, not breathing, not moving an inch, while it scraped it's way across the laminate countertop.  It traveled several feet before I finally jumped from my chair and snatched it off the counter, yelling out ""knock it off!"". 

This particular encounter happened a few weeks back.  It had been an extremely slow night and I'd been browsing on my laptop in the back office when I heard the front desk bell ring. We keep the lobby open 24hrs so it wasn't terribly unusual to still get a guest arriving at 3am.  It took me a few seconds to walk to the front but as I stepped out I was surprised to see the lobby was completely vacant.  Now, the lobby doors make a particular metal-scraping sound when they open and close and I hadn't heard someone pass through them.  I could dismiss not hearing the sound of a person entering the lobby before the bell rang because I hadn't been paying attention but there was no way I could have missed the sound of them exiting as I walked to the front.  In fact, aside from the low volume classical music being played over the muzak, the lobby was completely silent.  Curious and confused, I walked back into the office and replayed the security footage to see if I could find out where the guest had gone.

[This is from the surveillance camera above the front desk aimed towards the back of the lobby](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNex-kAhvqA&amp;feature=channel_video_title).  Just out of frame to the right is the entrance to the restaurant area (the doors are always kept locked).

His body could not regain the strength to make a come back and my dad's heart stopped. The doctors and nurses came much too late, twelve minutes later, to bring him back completely from the brink of death, but instead suffering a sink into a coma. 

That night, while my Dad lay in a non-responsive coma, I slept in a private waiting room in the ER while waiting to hear any news of change in his status. That night I had an out of body experience where I was in the ER room with him though things were different. In front of me, tilted up in bed was my Dad, smiling and asking me, ""What's wrong? Everything is okay. Trust me, everything is okay."" Apparently, a look of horror lay on my face as I also watched what appeared to be three demon-like beings take the life from him. That is how I interpreted it and somehow felt this was being communicated to me in this way. One had a tube down his throat and from his throat came (sorry this'll gross out some and I apologize) blood. I honestly forget where the tube led, but all I cared was they were draining my Dad of his blood and I couldn't get over what I was seeing. Another creature was pulling what looked like energy from the crown of his head. Another creature seemed to be simply overseeing the process from the corner of the room. My Dad appeared to be completely oblivious to it all....or was he? Maybe he knew, based on what he told me, it was like he was trying to tell me, while it appears to be an awful situation, he was okay and had come to terms with it all. 

I knew I was having an Out of Body Experience and everything felt as real as if I were standing literally in the ER room with him. I watched him begin to shake uncontrollably and  I snapped back into my body when I tried to communicate back with him. I woke up from the Out of Body Experience being shaken by my mother who stood over me. A look of fear was on her face as she told me ""He's having seizures, wake up!"" 

I had the choice to go see him or not as it might be a traumatic thing to watch, but I agreed to. I walked into his room, his body in a similar fashion to the position I saw him in the OBE, but he was unconscious still. His body was shaking violently and I could not believe what I was seeing. 

Was I just in this same room, but a few minutes ago in spirit or was it a terribly-rare coincidence? Was I sensing what he was going through from the other room? I've always been very sensitive to what I would call the non-physical world and this was an unexpected experience to say the least. I was not asking for it, nor wanting it, but it happened and for a while I did not know how to interpret it. To this day, I like to believe he was telling me that while everything looked and felt horrible that he was okay and was not afraid himself. However, I don't know if he was simply unaware of the horror that he was amidst. Certainly this all felt quite traumatic as I knew I was watching my Dad die before my eyes both literally and energetically. Had I seen what it looks like to die on the other side? 

Three days later we had the choice to let him go or not as he showed less and less signs of recovery/response to stimulus. Even if he had come out of his coma the doctors claimed he would be in a vegetable state. It was hours before he had his cardiac arrest that he signed papers stating that if such a thing were to occur that he did not want to be kept on life support. We decided to let him go and I felt that he was ready to go, to end his suffering and be at peace. 

That was in 2007. This is the first time I've told anyone about that night.

My mother and father had four children. The oldest, Mary, my brother, Danny, my sister, Sarah, and I. When my parents bought the house on 13th St, Mary was 7, making me about 12 months. 
The house was purchased by my parents in 1989 for 25grand. (This house was later estimated worth of aprox 90-100grand. First sign.)

Now, this house has since been torn down to allow for parking for a local college, which is planned to be expanded. It was built in 1875, and was the first house built on that block. The entire neighborhood was farmland at the time. 

My sister Mary has told me that from the first day they moved in, she remembered being scared and uncomfortable. My family moved around a lot, (dad was air force)so it's not as if she wasn't used to new and different houses. 

She said her first memory of anything supernatural was shortly after moving in. She remembers sitting in the dining room, on the floor, playing with a rotary phone my mother hadn't needed. She said she was pretending she was in an office and answering very important calls. But, there was someone on the other line. Someone, who could speak to her, even though the phone was disconnected and in fact, no longer had any cords or wires attached. Someone who knew her name.

The next incident mentioned is a few months later. My brother had bunk beds, and the family dog at the time slept on the bottom bunk. My brother tells us that he felt a hand between the bed and the wall attempting to grab him, and at one point, successful in pinching and bruising him. 

The small things started soon after and honestly, until the day we moved, they never stopped. Doors opening and closing - sometimes slowly, sometimes violently. Cupboards opening. Lights turning on or off. The typical activity. It became normal, in a gross way. 

Because I was so young, I don't have many memories until I was about 8. My parent's bedroom seemed to resonate a lot of activity, as far as the Dead Children go. You see- that's where we always saw them. My sister Sarah and I shared a bedroom at the end of the hall. I remember waking up, to use the bathroom and having to walk down the hall. When I passed my parent's room, I saw a girl. She stood in a night gown, and reached out her hand as if she was about to say something, but instead, turned around, and disappeared. 

I began a fear of what I said was a gorilla, in my closet. Unusual. But that's what I thought it looked like. It was huge and black, and appeared to be hairy. It would pass in front of the closet door, watching me, but it never left. I often made Sarah sleep in the same bed as me.
I later learnt she hated this, for she often saw a figure beneath my own bed, lying on it's back, head tilted so it could look at her. She was a big sister, so she'd brave walking by and getting in to protect me.

When we were a bit older, about two years down the road, things began to escalate. My sister Mary took the den on the main floor as her own bedroom, my brother took hers, and his old one was storage. 
Mary is terrified of spiders, but her bedroom became plagued with them. An old house is bound to have some spiders, but beyond the one here or there every so often, there was none anywhere else in the house. My father even had the house professionally sprayed, but they came back to her room. She'd wake up, and there'd be about 7-8 spiders above her bed, on the ceiling. She'd go get me, and I would come squash them for her. Middle of the night if needed. 

My mother had the same fear of bats. Once a week, she'd get a bat in her bedroom. Dad first started out carefully catching it, then letting it go. When this persisted, he assumed it was the same bat somehow getting back into the house. So he'd kill it.Again, a professional came out, but to no avail.

One event happened to my Uncle, my dad's younger brother. We had gone up to visit my mother's family, a few states away, and he house sat for my parents.He said he kept waking up to the sound of hooves going up and down the stairs. My uncle is a prison therapist. But to this day, he'll still say that those nights terrified him more than he has ever been.

I recall a small event, that Sarah suffered through. I was awake, early in the morning, reading *The Babysitter's Club* in bed. I had impeccable timing to look up, just as I saw her bed move suddenly a few inches across the floor. A brief second later, she awoke with a yelp, because she felt something jump on top of her. She slept in my bed that night.

In our closet, we began to see hand prints, on the wall. They were ashy, and washed away. But every week, they reappeared. Different positions. But they were unmistakably that of children's. 

There are many small events I won't include, just so it's not so lengthy. We frequently saw children, turning a corner, going up a flight of stairs, or heard angry,or sad, voices. Often objects would be moved, or lost entirely. But I assure you, something happened daily. Some small occurrence, or something more alarming. 

The last alarming phenomena occurred in what became our last summer there. I remember this day so vividly. It was June, and the day was a bit on the cool side, and just ever so slightly over cast. I was 11 years old. Sarah and I were watching a Backstreet Boys special on the Disney channel. Mary was swimming in the backyard, and Danny was getting his hair cut by Mom, also in the backyard. I decided, when our program ended, that I too, would like to go swimming. I went out the side door, to the deck that surrounded our pool.

When Mom and Danny had gone inside, Mary turned to me, very seriously, (I still remember how pale she looked, her long brown curls floating in the water next to her.) And asked me the first question in what would arguably be the most horrifying hour of our young lives.

""Do you see the little girl in Mom and Dad's bedroom window?""

Sure enough, when I looked up, I saw a little girl looking out at us. The windows were about two feet off the floor in the room, and reached near the ceiling. She appeared to be kneeling, and watching us. Only..she was sort of faded, like a mute watercolor. You could barely see the colours. She didn't seem solid. I knew instantly she was a ghost. I nodded that I did. 

For the next hour, a series of ghost children would blur and fade into a different child. We would test the other, on what they saw. We always saw the same child. The children would interact with us, point if I moved across the pool, or even wave back. I can still remember them. We saw no less than 50 different children. Each stayed for a brief moment, maybe 30 seconds or longer, before becoming someone else. In one case, I screamed for them to leave, and a boy began to sob, before a girl pulled him away while staring angrily at us. In another case, one girl pointed to the drive way moments before my father came home from work.

Eventually I pleaded, and Mary agreed to go inside and beg our parents that we had had enough. My mother, as always, dismissed us. But when my father could see me sobbing and visibly had reached my young limit, he called everyone to the kitchen table. 

My parents had always told us it was our imagination. Our house wasn't haunted. But that day, they both confessed that they, too, had seen and heard things. My father said he would hear people talking when he was up at night, (the rest of us asleep) and he was using the bathroom on the main floor. They would jiggle the door handle, but he never could quite back out what they said. He'd see Shadow People in the corner of his eyes. He once awoke, from falling asleep in front of the tv. When he turned it off, he saw a man in a suit with all black eyes behind him.

They told us that the previous owner's confessed to performing seances in my parent's bedroom. When the husband found out this was the cause to their terrifying activity, they sold their house. My parents thought it was absurd and ignored it. They couldn't afford to move, and attempted to just deal with it. 

We moved out in a few weeks,after the window incident, staying with a relative until my parents found a new home. For the first time in ten years,(and in my entire life at that point) we all slept soundly.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1bc84d,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1bc84d/ten_years_of_ghosts/,

I remember most of the events quite clearly, they didn't happen that long ago. Sorry this is a bit long.

Background Info: When I was in the 11th grade, my family moved houses because we couldn't afford the house we were living in. A little information about my family: I'm the oldest of 8 kids, at the time, my parents were in their early-mid 30s, and all of my grandparents were still alive, so there's no way any of this was our way of trying to cope with a relatives death. 

We had 4 dogs, 3 of them between 1-3 years old and all very large. The other one was old and going deaf, a border collie mix. 

We moved into an old traditional cabin-like home. Very sturdy, very quaint, and just enough room for all of us. The house sat on just over 4 acres of fenced in land. The gate at the front was held closed with bungee cord, and the house was not visible from the road. 

[First Floor](http://i.imgur.com/J2qHb.png) and [Second Floor](http://i.imgur.com/wIDO9) layouts.

What Happened:

We'd been living there for about a month, and one night, we all went out to eat for my little siblings' birthday (twins, turning 6 or 7). Before we left, we put all the dogs in the house and locked all three of the doors: the one that went out of my bedroom, the door to the screened-in porch off the kitchen, and the front door. The windows were always locked for safety precautions. On our way out, we flipped on the front porch light and closed the gate.

We left around 6 and got home around 9. The gate was still closed, everything normal, but as we unlocked the gate and pulled up, we were immediately shocked. All of the dogs had gotten out of the house. My mom parks the car while my dad goes sprinting up the porch. I run around to the back of the house to make sure there wasn't another car, fearing we were being robbed.  

There wasn't anything there. I walked back around to the front to find my parents visibly shaken. My dad told me, ""The door's still locked."" We stood there looking at the house, and my mom points out that the porch light wasn't on. We all remembered turning it on before we left. 

My dad and I left my mom and the kids outside while we went and checked the house. Dad unlocked the door, and the first thing we noticed when we stepped in was the smell. It smelled like straight up piss. I'll never forget it because it was so foul. He flipped the lights by the door on so we wouldn't be standing in the pitch-black. 

It was evident that we hadn't been robbed. Mom's laptop was still sitting there on the table, the huge flat-screen was still hanging over the fireplace, Xbox beside it. We checked all of the doors; all of them were still locked. None of the windows had been opened, and the whole freaking house smelled like piss. 

I went upstairs to check their bedrooms. When reaching into the nook to flip the light on, something that felt like fingernails grazed my arm. I lurched forward to and got the light on. Nothing was there, but I could have sworn something touched me.

After turning the lights upstairs on, I made my way downstairs. I remember I was standing on the bottom step when I heard my mom yell, ""Matt! The dogs!"" 

I'll never forget the scene outside. Every one of the dogs were on the ground, legs sticking out, all gasping for air, hyperventilating. 

My mind immediately jumped to dehydration, but it was winter, and dogs don't pass out from dehydration in 3 hours. We even kept a bowl of water on the screen porch at all times. The dogs could always get back there when they were outside because one of the screens on the door were broken. It's like they all just had panic attacks at the same time. 

We got the dogs to calmed down, checked them for injuries, and then just kind of brushed it off. None of us wanted to talk about how they got out, we just took everyone inside and everyone was sent off to bed.

The oldest and smallest dog, Holly, slept with me in my room. French doors led to the back-porch, and because we'd moved in recently, I hadn't put any curtains on them. I kept the back-porch light on that night, still creeped out. In the middle of the night, Holly woke me up. I sat up to find her staring out the backdoor, breathing very heavily. I went to walk over and see if anything was actually out there, but when I got up, the light went out and something banged on the door. Of course I freaked out. I picked the dog up and went running out of the room screaming bloody murder.

So last summer i was doing service in peru. We were staying in this little village in the mountains at the time, helping the locals with various issues. Anyways, one night me and like 4 or 5 kids who were also there decide to go star gazing. The night sky in this town was incredible, you could see more stars than you can imagine and satellites too. So we go and lay down in front of the local church to get a good look at the night sky. After about 15 minutes this little girl comes up to us. She has a flashlight and starts flashing it in our eyes. Also, she was crying and i mean fucking BAWLING. Shes yelling at us in spanish something along the lines of ""dont look at the stars"" or ""the stars are evil"". When we tell her to stop she starts laughing maniacally, except tears are still coming from her eyes. Then she starts telling us she is blind. We were pretty freaked at this point so we tell her to go away but she doesnt. Me and 2 other kids decide to move about 100 yards away to this grass field so we could lay down and watch the stars in peace. Shortly after we settle in the grass, the same girl comes up to us again. She is still fucking laughing and still fucking crying. Flashing her light in our faces. She moves behind us and starts turning her light off and on like a strobe. We tried to ignore her but it was too annoying and too scary to ignore for very long. She goes silent but keeps her light on our faces. Pretty soon one the kids ""Bryce"" gets up and turns around to tell her to stop. Me and the other kid who was with us follow suit, however, when we turn around she is gone. The light that was in our eyes not more than 3 seconds before is gone and she is nowhere to be seen. Keep in mind this a completely open field there was no way she could have run out of sight that quickly and there was nowhere for her to hide. We were pretty shaken up after that.

1363959653.0,52,self.Thetruthishere,1asqdm,[Me] I grew up in Mexico. Saw strange things as a child. ,ALL_PUNS_INTENDED,66,14,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1asqdm/me_i_grew_up_in_mexico_saw_strange_things_as_a/,"Hello all,

I'm a 23 year old male, currently living in the US and A. I grew up in Mexico and spent weekends with my grandparents on my mother's side of the family. I came here to share some experiences I had as a child in their home. I apologize for the length, but I feel that you guys should know the layout of the my grandparents home before I continue. If you just want to get to the good stuff, feel free to scroll to where the bullet points start. I have no history of the house, nor do I know when it was built, but I do know it creeped me the hell out from time to time. The house faces west and when you walk in the front door there is a small foyer type hall way that has three paths. To the left, you will find the living room and dining room, following that same path will lead to the kitchen, then two bedrooms and a bathroom at the end. The kitchen and dining room are separated by a door that swings both ways. It is basically one long hall way with all the rooms connected and no doors separating them save for the kitchen and dining room.  Going straight ahead will lead you to the back yard. On the right were two more bedrooms and a bathroom at the end much like the left sans living room and kitchen. At the time, I lived in the northern region of Mexico and the house has no A/C unit so it would be very warm during the Summer. I had four experiences that I remember happening in that home and all of them happened while I was 5-6 years old so they very well could have been figments of my imagination. 

* One morning I'm coming out of the kitchen about to sit down to watch TV when I see my grandma's rocking chair rocking by itself. My grandma and I were the only ones home at the time. As a child I thought nothing of it and sat down anyway.

* Another morning, I was in the room on the furthest end of the of the left path playing with my toys. Out of nowhere I felt very threatened and had a sudden urge to flee. I remember running out of there toward the kitchen where my grandma was. When I looked behind me as I ran, I swear I saw a dark/black figure coming after me almost shaped like a giant hand. Weird, I know. 

* One summer night, my grandma and I were in bed (I shared a bed with my grandma as a child, don't judge.) the window that is right next to the bed slid open rather forcefully. This window, if I remember correctly, measures roughly 36"" x 36"" and it was an old pane that didn't open very easily. It happened at least twice that night and my grandma told me to ignore it and go back to sleep. So I did. 

* The fourth and creepiest occurrence happened when in was in the backyard playing with snails in my granparents' garden. There is a small window in the bathroom at the end of the right path that faces said garden. I remember hearing a voice come from that window asking me to ""come here."" The voice wasn't threatening in tone, nor was it a deep voice, it sounded more like a woman or a child. I just remember being freaked out because I knew for a fact that no one else was home save for my grandma and I. 

To date, no one will spend the night in that home by themselves. Several of my cousins have also had similar experiences in that home. I will attempt to get more stories from them as well as my sisters. Sorry for the wall of text, thanks so much for letting me share, reddit, I love you guys!

1360792726.0,53,self.Thetruthishere,18gz58,I see/hear creepy shit.,arrownin,64,11,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18gz58/i_seehear_creepy_shit/,"Hey guys, new to posting in reddit, and new to this subreddit, however I thought that you would all appreciate what I have to say, being that it's all true and very paranormal.

I've always been able to ""hear"" and ""see"" stuff that usually isn't there. My first was when I was a baby, so I don't really believe it fully, but it's interesting. I was in a room at the age of four, with my mom and my grandma, and I pointed to an empty corner of the room and said ""Who's that man?"", which of course freaked out my grandma and my mother haha. Like I said though, kids say the dumbest things so I don't count that one. 
The first ones that I do count, started when I was about 11 or 12. I was living in my grandmas house after my parents had gotten a divorce, and I would start to hear tapping on my window. It wasn't that strange at first, but it was consistent. Night after night the tapping over and over, it wasn't until one night in my curiosity, I thought I'd try something. I tapped on the window, ""Shake and a Haircut"", and the window tapped back twice, (two bits!). 
After that I think that I unlocked something, I started hearing footsteps at night, I felt uncomfortable in empty rooms, and I heard conversations downstairs, that were so soft that I couldn't understand. (Sounded like a dinner party going on downstairs, I liked to imagine a 1950s ball dance because of the disney haunted mansion room). None of that really bothered me that much though, just kept me a bit edgy. 
One night when I was 14, my grandma was driving home along this highway at about 9pm (ish) at night. I saw something for about two seconds that  I can't really explain. I saw this shadow man thing, that was blacker than the night on the side of the road. Except we turned so that the headlights flared at the shadow man, but the shadow man didn't disappear in the headlights like how normal shadows do, the shape of the man didn't even change. It was horrifying because it was this fully illuminated SHADOW that was in the shape of a man, yet it was blobby and distorted, like the shadow was TRYING to look like a man, but couldn't quite get it. Needless to say, this spooked the hell out of me, and I was shivering all night, my grandma was really surprised at how shocked I was the rest of the night. I was interested in the paranormal though, so this was cool as well as being scary, so it wasn't THAT bad I suppose. 
So nothing happened for awhile, until I was 16-17 alone at my house, during my time in an online school. That's when the shit really hit the fan. At night when I went to get a drink of water, or snacks, I started seeing faces in the corner of my eye, in the windows. These distorted faces of people that looked angry, or mad at me. They weren't just flashes either, they remained in sight. All I would have to do was look back at where I thought I saw something, and BAM, scary face. I started seeing these weird shapes and figures in the corner of my eye during this time, I just figured I was getting cabin fever from being in too much, so I wrote it off. 
A year later, 18 years old, I started hearing running down the hallway, like someone is playing around running up and down, or running back to get something they forgot for school. But this running happened at 3 am, so it was pretty weird to say the least. Not hard steps either, sounded like someone had socks on or something. Strange.
In the same year, I was getting something to eat at night again (Im fat I know) and as I turn off the lights in the kitchen to go back to my room, this GIANT shadow flies over me. Engulfs me and flies right the fuck over me. Like this giant figure jumped up on me and went through me. I don't know if that was a trick of the eyes, or whatever, all I know is that it was the same darker than dark as I've seen when I saw that shadow man. 
As of now, the faces kinda died down, (not to many windows in this house) and the noises have died down, however I still get feelings of being watched or being ""not alone"" in my house. I haven't seen anything since, which is a good thing in my book. 

Hopefully you enjoyed this, as it helps me get this stuff off my chest. Maybe you guys can figure out if Im insane or actually do see and hear this stuff? I looked up shadow people and apparently I might have seen one of them, or two of them, don't know. Anyway I'm out, gunna go eat lunch.

I was a freshman in college and living in a double with another dude fresh off the plane from India. He was nice enough once we sorted out his hygiene issue, and we would stay up late talking about our different customs and beliefs.

Then one day I watched The Exorcism of Emily Rose (I think it was that movie, if not, it was the one where they talk about 3am being the witching hour). My roommate and I stayed up late that night, talking about random demon-related things, and he mentioned how in India, it's said that when you get that shivery, bad feeling out of the blue, those are evil spirits and malevolent forces entering the room or something like that. I went on to tell him about the movie I had just seen (we used to watch lots of scary movies together), and was telling him about the witching hour as it was described in the movie. Then, all of a sudden, the light turned out. I looked over at my clock, and it was exactly 3am. I climbed down from my bed to turn the light back on, and I found that the switch (one of those ones you have to kind of pinch and twist to turn on) had been physically rotated off. I turned it on, we both just kind of stared at each other in silence for a while, and didn't sleep that night.

1317326558.0,51,self.Thetruthishere,kvn3o,There was something in our back yard.,Crystaleyes,57,6,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kvn3o/there_was_something_in_our_back_yard/,"First of all, I want to say that I've been lurking in this sub reddit for a couple of weeks.  I love the concept, and jumped in here, eager to soak up everyone's real, unexplained experiences.  I really want to see it pick up and do well.  I've posted this experience already under one of those ""What was your most creepy experience"" questions, it got buried, I don't think anyone took notice.  So I will re-tell it here.

This took place about twelve years ago, early in the morning before daylight.  My husband left for work around 4:30 a.m.  I planned on going back to bed for a few hours, I didn't have to be to work until 9:00.  Before doing that, I needed to let our dog out into the back yard to do her morning business.  

I switched on the outside porch light and opened the inner door.  Before I could open the outer screen door, the dog jumped up to look outside through the screen.  She looked to the side yard and started a low, menacing growl, and the hair along her back started to stand up.  I looked where she was looking, and saw a white, billowy something that seemed to wave in the breeze.  I started to laugh at the dog, thinking it was just a plastic grocery bag caught on a bush.  Then my heart started to jump when I realized that (1) there was no breeze-it was dead still outside, and (2) there were no bushes in that particular area for anything to be caught on.

I quickly shut the inside door and locked it.  The dog continued to growl, and I could tell she really wanted out there, but no way was I going to let her out right then.  I peeked out the window, and it was still there doing it's weird undulating, billowing movements.  It was a bright white, misty looking, about the size of a large cat.  It floated about five feet off the ground.  

I continued to watch it.  After about five minutes it began to slowly make it's way toward the back of our property, which is quite heavily wooded.  It moved in a straight line, and seemed to stay at the same height.  I watched it until it went beyond the reach of the light, into the woods.  

Later in the morning I went out to see if there were any signs of it, but of course I didn't find anything.  I think about it to this day.  I haven't seen it since.  I wish I would have been brave enough to walk over to it at the time.  
Maybe not the scariest story ever, but to me it was really creepy-especially our dog's reaction to it.  Not much would cause her to get her hackles up like that.

1369039983.0,50,self.Thetruthishere,1eon84,Creepy Encounter at Diamond Fork Hot Springs in Utah [Me],sweetsweetjayne,64,14,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1eon84/creepy_encounter_at_diamond_fork_hot_springs_in/,"I have been reading Reddit threads for a over a year now, the ones my friend in India sends me, but I finally created an account today in order to respond to this Diamond Fork hot springs story: http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1dwdf8/my_skinwalker_encounter_me_fam/"". 

Something almost identical happened to me at Diamond Fork hot springs 16 years ago. So identical, in fact, that I read this story feeling stunned. 

I always tell people that my Diamond Fork hot springs experience is the most terrified I've ever been in my life, so terrified, in fact, that I haven't been back ... until two weeks ago, during daylight :). I've often wondered if it was all in my head, but after reading the story at the link above, I feel more validated that it wasn’t in my imagination.

I was going to BYU at the time and one of my classmates and I spontaneously decided to go hiking up to Diamond Fork hot springs around 1 a.m. The parking lot was full of about 15-20 cars when we got there and even though we were alone, I didn't stop to think twice about it maybe not being the smartest thing in the world for two girls to be hiking up to the hot springs in the middle of the night I don’t naturally get squeamish or scared about things like that.

But as soon as we left the parking lot that night and started up the main trail to the hot springs, almost immediately, I had this overwhelming feeling like something was following us. It was one of the most intense feelings of fear and being watched, that I’ve ever felt in my life. Every one of my senses was on full alert. The feeling got stronger as we went along. I was filled with a strong sense of how very, very alone we were and that we had done something stupid and we could be (or were in) some kind of danger. Like I said, I normally don’t think this way, so this level of terror was unusual for me. I had also been up to Diamond Fork hot springs before a couple times in the middle of the night, and I had not been scared (with bigger groups of friends, though). 

So as we were going along, I had a very strong feeling like, “Don’t slow down, keep going at a steady pace, and no matter what you do, don’t let on that you think something is following you, don’t talk about it.” What sucked is that my friend was having a bladder infection and we had to stop about three times for her to pee in the middle of the trail! Each time I was thinking, “HURRY HURRY HURRY” but on the outside just kept up a light, pleasant conversation which felt forced because I was literally shaking with terror. I did get up the courage to casually shine the flashlight down the path at one point while she was taking one of her potty breaks, but nothing was there.

At one point, I told my friend, “Oh, I want to tell you something when we get to the hot springs,” and at one point, she said, “What was that?” We were silent for a few seconds, but I didn’t hear anything but the water sloshing in her bottle in her backpack, so I lightly said, “Oh, it’s nothing, it’s just the water in your bottle.” So there was about 30 minutes of this, us walking completely alone on the trail, me feeling highly certain there was some presence following us, me trying to come up with meaningless, banal conversation, and finally, a group of about 10 people passed us coming back from the hot springs, going down the way we’d come. The spell seemed to be broken and the thick feeling of being watched or followed went away as soon as they passed us. I didn’t feel like anything was following us anymore for the last 10 minutes of the hike.

When we got the hot springs, and we were surrounded by like 10 or so other people up there soaking as well, and we were setting down our stuff to get in the hot pools, my friend asked me what I was going to tell her. I said I felt like we were being followed the entire way, and she said, “I did, too.” She then told me that she had heard footsteps following behind us on the path, switching from one side of the path to the other, about 15 yards behind us (not that she THOUGHT she’d heard footsteps, but that she had heard them). When she had said, “What was that?” she said it was NOT the water sloshing in her bottle that she had heard, but a branch breaking about 15 yards behind us. She said whenever we’d stop for her to pee, the footsteps would continue for a second or so, and then stop.  Then they’d start again when we’d start. Something obviously instinctively kept her from saying anything out loud to me about it, too. She said the feeling started for her as soon as we left the parking lot, but that as soon as that big group of people passed us, the feeling went away, just as it had for me.

We were definitely still feeling scared after our soak, so we hiked down from the hot springs with a big group of people. On the drive home, we talked over what it could have been. Nothing really made sense. We thought maybe it was a wild animal, perhaps waiting for us to separate and attack us … the hot springs are miles from nearby towns and known to have wild animals (including cougars) in the hills. But she pointed out that wild animals don’t break branches and usually move silently through the forest (you can’t hear footsteps). I thought it could have been some guy with bad intentions, but when I shone the flashlight down the path, there was no one there. The third option was that it was something not human; some evil spirit or presence or something (suggested by another person; my then-roommate). It was hard because it had characteristics that were a cross between something animal and something human (like an “animal with remarkable intelligence,” that the story at the link above mentioned). But because I hadn’t seen or heard any of the footsteps first-hand, and only my friend had, I felt like I had to always end my telling of the story with, “Yeah, it could have been all in my head.” After reading the linked story above, though, I feel more validated that there was something there, and I can only surmise that they must have experienced the same kind of thing/entity following them, whatever it was. It is insane to me that they experienced something so remarkably similar.

**TL;DR** - Got followed by someone/something up the Diamond Fork hot springs trail in Utah in the middle of the night. My friend heard it, too. No explanation makes sense as to what it was; it seemed like a cross between something animal and something human.",,False,,t5_2sntx,1369040284.0,,,True,t3_1eon84,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1eon84/creepy_encounter_at_diamond_fork_hot_springs_in/,
1360684667.0,49,self.Thetruthishere,18drc2,[ME] The Burgundy Bus,strixus,62,13,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18drc2/me_the_burgundy_bus/,"This story happened between Macon, GA, and Brunswick, GA, along parts of I-16 and I-95. It was fully daylight the entire time this happened, and to this day I get the cold creepies thinking about this. It may not seem that strange at first, but it was very, very weird.

So, a bit of background first. I grew up in a family that did road trips constantly. My parents were road racers, and I traveled all over the south by road since before I could remember. I think very little of driving for three hours to get somewhere, and I've seen a lot of strange shit on the road. But this one is probably the weirdest worldly thing thing I've seen that I couldn't explain away with a bit of rational thought. It might not sound that weird, but I have chills thinking about it to this day, nearly 15 years later. 

I'd been visiting my then boyfriend (now husband) at his home just north of Atlanta, and the two of us were now driving to south Georgia to attend an anual get together I was obligated to attend that coming weekend. At Macon, we take the split to get onto I-16, and traffic is quite light since it is in the middle of the day on a Thursday. In fact, once we are beyond Macon, we are the only car on the road.

Or so I thought, until I look behind us, and realize there is a single other vehicle, between a hundred to fifty car lengths back: a burgundy red tour bus. Let me pause and describe this bus, because this is important. It looks like a standard touring bus, the sort you charter for taking somewhere with a large group. But this bus is a deep, metallic burgundy (the paint had metal flake, oddly enough), and the windows are so darkly tinted you cannot see inside the bus. There are no markings on the bus, not even a DOT number or operator number. 

I remember commenting to my boyfriend about it, and then not looking back at it for a while. Twenty minutes later I look back up... and it is still there, still the same distance behind us. That's odd, I remember thinking, but then go back to driving.

A bit further on, I pull into a rest area, as I've got to use the girls room. I pull in, and, much to my surprise, so does the bus. I notice as I walk into the restroom that I can see inside the bus now, and there was no one in sight. I do my thing, come back out, note that there's still no one in the bus, and go back to the car. My boyfriend has been in the car this whole time, and he comments on the bus, asking if its the same one. 

I pull out of the rest area, and the bus follows behind us, with perhaps less than 3 minutes between us. I ask my boyfriend if he saw anyone leave the bus (which had been in his full view the whole time) and he says that he didn't. 

We keep driving. The bus is still behind us, still staying back about the same distance, no matter what speed I drive (well within the ""Georgia cops don't care"" range, of course). 

Eventually, close towards Savannah, I need gas. So I pull off at a gas station. And there behind me is that bus. Now, this wasn't a big station, and I honestly didn't think it could have room for this bus. But the bus pulls into the lot, and sits. By the time I get out to put gas in, I can't see anyone driving the bus, or near it. I fill the tank, all the while watching the bus, and pull out of the station a bit faster than perhaps was reasonable. 

The bus pulls out a bit behind us, and follows us back onto the interstate. Without having gotten gas, or anyone having gone on or off the bus.

We turn onto I-95. There's a bit more traffic at this point, but the bus is still behind us, holding about the same distance. And there it stayed, until I turned off I-95 at Brunswick, GA. It did not follow me off that turn. 

To this day, I still feel freaked out about that bus, as does my now husband. I can't really explain why, either. There was just something wrong about it, about the lack of markings, or anything else. I've never seen a bus with windows tinted that dark, either, or that color red.

Recently, my mom starting to experience things that I have been encountering for years: doors closing/opening, hearing people talking, seeing things. 
Now I know what she has been experiencing. There is a spirit in my house that likes to reside on the stairs, and his name is ‘the man on the stairs’. I say this with certainty because if I call this spirit by any other name, bad things happen. My friends know this. I have seen him many times, heard him walk around when I am home alone, and watched things move on their own. The reason I bring this up is because my mother, in her experiencing these for the (seemingly) first time, is calling this spirit by her deceased brother’s name. And the man on the stairs isn’t happy. But, before when someone calls him a different name, it never was this bad.
But a couple months ago, my mom invited someone (very not qualified) over to ""bless"" the house...
Honestly, I could have slapped her. I’ve done my research, and unless someone is qualified to do a blessing/cleansing, it is not something to mess around with, because it can make things worse. Yet at first, everything calmed down and I forgot all about it. But for the last week or so, shit has gotten so crazy that I can't be alone in my own house anymore. I've woken up to loud, violent knocking at least three nights in the past week, and it genuinely made me scared, and it's not a feeling I am used to having when it comes to the paranormal. I can't keep my door open anymore, and I always have to have some sort of sound playing, because if I don't, a loud angry voice starts calling my name. My dreams have gotten violent when I can manage to sleep, which is really abnormal for me, and this whole mess is starting to affect my attitude and personal life. I did some snooping, and found out that my friend was hearing things when she stayed the night this past week. 
I’m not sure if it was my mom’s doing or not, but this is getting ridiculous. Any and all tips/support/advice is welcome because obviously something in my house is pissed off. And I honestly have no idea what to do.

It's about a somewhat weird experience I had as a kid.

My family used to spend some days each summer at our cabin, near a small forest lake and a small town. It's an area with lots of old summer-houses and cabins.

As a young boy, I was somewhat bored being away from the civilisation, but the one thing I loved about it was fishing, so I grabbed every opportunity I could even though the lake was quite hard to catch anything in. Sometimes we would be in a boat on the lake, other times I just fished from land since I was not old enough to use the boat by myself.

This morning I was fishing from land, I had been doing so all morning with no luck. The classic bamboo fishing rod, float, hook and worm.

I tried different places for my float and different depths for my bait. No bites.
As I was just about to give up, I heard a calm voice from behind: ""Go an inch deeper and move the float an inch to the right. Then you will catch a fish.""

I turned my head and met the eyes of a boy of my height, but with a face looking older than me. ""I'm a relative of yours."" he said. Didn't think of it much as I did have a few relatives in the area, yet couldn't place him.
His clothes looked like what was in fashion many years earlier, like a kid would wear in the late 60's. There were not many kids in the area, and most of those who used to be there I recognised. This kid, however, I hadn't seen before.

I thought ""well what the hell"" and did as he suggested, adjusted the float up the line one inch, and placed it back in the water slightly to the right of were I pulled it out. Just as the weight of the sink raised the float, the float instantly disappeared, and I pulled a fish out of the water.

In amazement I turned my head to thank the boy, only to find there was no boy around. How could he be gone so quickly? And how could he be so sure I would get a catch? No way he could have seen through the dark water - standing behind me - if I couldn't!

And any relative I think I would have recognised.
It might just have been an extremely talented fisher-boy, giving me advice just to silently dart off... but something about this I still find a bit eerie.

We were staying in the only hotel in town, which is a huge, and very old, french colonial building: 14' ceilings, hardwood floors, solid teak doors, crown molding. You get the picture.

There were only 2 other groups of guests in the place. One was a Chinese woman and her mother, and one was a group of 5 aid workers of mixed nationality, ranging in age between their early 40s and late 20s. The hotel was 5 stories, so each group had an entire enormous floor to itself.

At this point the four of us had been traveling together for 3 months in very cramped quarters. Rooms were only $4.50, so we took the opportunity to spread out to the opposite ends of the floor, and all have a room to ourselves.

I was dead asleep, when the very heavy door to my room started slamming repeatedly against it's frame. It was locked, and it was as if a strong man was shaking it violently back and forth by the handle. I had been woken up this way multiple times by my traveling companions, so I rolled over and checked my watch. When I saw that it was 3:30am, chills ran down my arms and up the back of my neck, because there is no way anyone I was with would be awake at that time.

I bolted out of bed, got in a fighting stance near the door, and said in the least terrified voice I could muster, ""Hello?""

The door abruptly stopped shaking. I stood there straining to hear footsteps over the blood pounding in my ears, but none came. I started walking back toward the bed, but then heard the unmistakeable sound of hundreds of children running and laughing. It sounded as if the hallway was packed full with a stampede of ecstatic grade-schoolers, sprinting past my door. After about 30 seconds, the sound of the children faded away.

I stood in the middle of the room completely clueless as to what to do next. Before this, I did not believe in anything supernatural at all. I couldn't believe what had happened, but I was completely terrified, so I decided the only thing for it was to sprint to my brother's room and find out if he had heard any of it, or if I was just dreaming.

I opened the door, ran as fast as I could down the hall, and almost ran smack into him coming around the corner. He had had the EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE. We went down the hall and knocked on the third guy's door, but he didn't answer. We were pretty freaked out, so immediately we assumed he had been abducted by the ghost child army.

We went to the fourth guy's room, and found the third guy in there in the same state as us. Both of them had experienced everything I described. The next morning we tried to ask the proprietor if they knew anything about it, but he spoke zero English, and our Khmer didn't extend past please, thank you, and 1-10, all the way on up to metaphysical horror, so we didn't get very far.

Believe it or not, this happened to my friends and I. As I said, before this, I did not believe in the supernatural. I don't know what to believe, but I know what happened that night, and it was definitely paranormal.

1363691659.0,51,self.Thetruthishere,1al4ot,"[FAM] Grandparents' experiences in a house that was used as a Masonic hall, a high school, and a roller skating rink",beatleape,59,8,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1al4ot/fam_grandparents_experiences_in_a_house_that_was/,"I posted a story on /r/Thetruthishere last night and got some positive feedback, so I figured I'd share another story that I heard from my grandmother when I was younger.

My grandparents moved into this pretty spacious house after my mom graduated from high school in 1971.  The original part of the house had been built in the very early 1800s and many additions were put on the house as the years went by.  The additions to the house were always added onto the back of the structure, so the house was very long and narrow.  Every time an addition was put on, they would add another basement, but each additional basement was narrower and smaller than the last.

After my grandparents moved in, my grandmother (Irish Catholic, NEVER believed in ghosts or the paranormal until any of this started to happen) began to notice some strange goings-on.  Initially, the occurrences were small; my grandmother would take out the ""rubbish"" (as she called it) and would walk back to the house only to find herself locked out, even though she swore she left the door unlocked.  Pretty easily explainable things like that.  Soon, however, more noticeable and inexplicable things began to happen.  One time she said she set the table for dinner and then went back into the kitchen and came back and the table had been rearranged.  Another time my family was eating dinner and heard a mirror fall off the wall and crash (they said they heard the glass shatter) upstairs.  My grandmother asked my uncle and my mom to take a broom upstairs to clean it up, but when they got up there, the mirror had been placed neatly on a chair, but wasn't broken after all.

This is where it gets really bizarre.  My mom and dad were already dating at the time, so when my dad would come visit, he would sleep over in one of the spare bedrooms in the back of the house (the back addition was put on in the late 1800s).  He said that there were several nights that he could not sleep because he saw silhouettes of people circling the room throughout the night.

After my mom got married and my uncle joined the navy, the house was too big for my grandparents, so they decided to sell.  The real estate agent came over to check out the house and she went down into the basement to check the boiler and the hot water heater, etc.  She was down there for about five minutes and then ran up the stairs and told my grandmother, ""I'm not selling this house, there's spooks in the basement!"" She got into her car and drove off.  They had to find another real estate agent.

So those were the stories that my grandmother told me, but since I was a little kid when she told them to me, she left out some of the pertinent details that make the story that much creepier.  When I got older, my mom told me that right after my grandparents bought the house, a neighbor told my grandmother that the previous resident of the house was a depressed artist who hanged himself in the back basement.  That would explain the real estate agent's reaction to the cellar.  My mom also told me that the house had been used for different purposes over the years (a Masonic hall being one of them... I guess there was a large dome in the ceiling that had been covered up by a ""regular"" ceiling in the 1940s).  It was also used as an all-boy's high school until the Civil War broke out.  Most of the boys went off to war and only a handful of them returned.

My mom was doing genealogical research a few years ago and found out the creepiest fact of them all.  Apparently, since my family has lived in that town for several generations, we actually had relatives who lived in the back section of the house in the late 1800s.  It turns out that two of my great-great aunts (or something to that effect) died of scarlet fever as children on the same night in the room in which my dad saw the shadows circling the bedroom.  When I found that out, I was thoroughly creeped out.

Thanks for reading!  Thoughts/comments would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR Grandma's house was haunted, some poltergeist activity.  Later learned it could have been caused by ancestors.

[ME],theredheaddiva,65,16,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/urwf0/still_not_sure_what_we_all_saw_me/,"This happened when I was a teenager. I'm 32 now so some details may have become a little hazy over time. I still remain skeptical after this event. I really don't have an explanation for it. 

It was daytime and I was hanging out with some coworkers at their apartment in Sacramento. I was the youngest at 16, the others were in their late teens, early twenties. Two guys lived in this apartment, Greg and Aron. 

There were 7 of us in the spare room. A few sitting on the couch, some on chairs and a few on the floor. A couple of people were drinking beer (I wasn't) and we were all watching Trainspotting and chatting. Aron got up to use the bathroom during the movie. It was just to the right of room we were hanging out in. The bathroom light was one of those kinds that had a fan attached to it. You could see the light of the bathroom from the spare room but not directly into it. 

When Aron came out of the bathroom he left the light on. He came back, sat down and proceeded to continue watching the movie. A few minutes later the light and fan switched off and a woman walked out of the bathroom and past the spare room doorway into the living room. We kept watching the movie, not thinking anything of it but about 30 seconds later we all started to realize..... we were all in the room!! All 7 of us were accounted for. I got goosebumps. Who the hell was that????

We all got up to look. There was no window in the bathroom. The deadbolt of the front door of the apartment was locked. Windows were all shut. We checked outside and the sidewalk gate was closed and locked. Who WAS that?? We all described the same thing. A woman about my height with shoulder length dark blond hair, wearing modern casual shirt and pants walked out of the bathroom after the light and fan went off on its own. 

Greg admitted that earlier in the week, he picked up his mom's ashes and brought them home. She had passed away recently and he was still mourning her. That his mom turning off the light was perhaps her looking out for him, making sure he didn't waste electricity. Just letting him know she was near. 

My friend Corey wouldn't believe what we just witnessed. He was completely flipping out. I was calm but seriously creeped out. I had heard strange noises before in the condo I lived in with my mom that had been previously occupied by a mortician we knew but this was the first time I had seen firsthand something like that. It was also the last time. I haven't experienced anything too strange or unexplainable since then. 

I still remain highly skeptical. I have no idea what that was or what really happened. There could be a reasonable explanation but I don't know. I won't say it was a ghost since I can't say for sure. I just really don't know. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_urwf0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/urwf0/still_not_sure_what_we_all_saw_me/,

I don't remember *exactly* how the story plays out, but its something very similar to this.

To set the scene, its around five or six o'clock in the morning in the middle of the summer. The streets are dimly lit by the sunrise and streetlights and my dad is just leaving home to pick up his friend to head off to work. 

As they are driving, they come up to a red light at an intersection near a collection apartment buildings. As they wait for the green, my dad spots one of his good friends who lives in one of the apartments walking by his car (I can't remember her name - lets just call her Lisa). He calls out, ""Hey, Lisa! What are you doing out here this early in the morning? Want a ride back to your place?""

""Oh, no. I'm alright. Just getting some fresh air this morning. Thanks though!""

""Alright, see you later!"" said my dad right before driving off.

Later that day, after work, my dad decides to go out to a club (this was before I was born or before my dad even met my mom, so my dad was still a partier at the time). When he meets up with his friends, including the one he went to work with that morning, he receives some really horrible news. He is informed that Lisa committed suicide the previous night at ten o'clock by jumping from her apartment, about eight or nine stories up. Obviously my dad and his friend rejected this because they both saw her in the morning, after she apparently committed suicide. Neither of them believed that she had killed herself. It just seemed impossible since they both saw her and they were both **abso-fucking-lutely** positive it was her.

A few days later, they attended her funeral.

*NOTE: My dad has a few other intriguing encounters with people of the after life. If you're interested in any other stories, I would be more than glad to share them for I believe they are truly thrilling.*

**SECOND STORY BY REQUEST**

Alright, this story is *very* similar to the first one, so I'll be sure to add a few more stories later if I can remember any.

When my dad was a kid, perhaps around age ten or eleven, he would go up north, far from the big city, to his grandfathers cottage for about a month. He would only go with family, leaving behind school friends ultimately cutting off all contact with them.

When he got back, he was tremendously eager to reconnect with the kids who he had not seen for weeks. This particular year, about a day after he returned home to the city, my dads brother begged him to play street hockey in the lane way behind the houses. 

While playing with my uncle, my dad spotted one of his good friends, Frankie, walking away from where he was. He was walking rather quickly along the side of lane way. Being excited to see his friend, my dad called out to Frankie, ""FRANKIE! Wanna play some ball hockey?!"" No answer. Frankie continued to walk quickly away with his head down and then turned into his garage. That's when my dad lost sight of him. He figured Frankie went inside and that he didn't hear my dad shouting. So like any other kid would do in this situation, my dad dropped his stick and chased after him. 

He went into Frankie's garage, through the backyard, to the backdoor and knocked. My dad waited some time and expected Frankie to answer the door. Instead Frankie's uncle answered. ""Can Frankie come out and play hockey?""

Frankie's uncle took a *long* pause. Looking into the house behind this man, my dad can see Frankie's mother and grandmother slowly turn the corner into the hallway and stare my dad down with a puzzled expression. All three turned and looked at each other as they muttered some words in Italian that my dad barely understood. 

""Nicola (my dad), Frankie died two weeks ago. He was hit by a car in the lane way.""

""What? What are you talking about? I just saw him walk into the house.""

The three turned as white as the ghost my dad just saw. In the four weeks that my dad was at the cottage with no contact whatsoever to any of his friends back home, his good friend Frankie had passed away only to see him two weeks after his supposed death.

My Grandfather had been battling the end stages of Liver disease for about a month, and it was brutal for him to go through and my family to watch.  In the moments of lucidity he had, he would tell me that he thought this was his final test (the immense pain, dementia, etc...) before he could see Grandma again. Everybody in the family was ready for him to go, and none of us wanted to see him keep suffering.

So Christmas Eve, around 2am, our phones start ringing. The land line in my parents' room, my room, and the kitchen and office downstairs. They just kept fucking ringing whether you picked them up or not.  I decided to investigate and was met by my parents coming out of their room, just as confused as I was.

This went on for about two minutes (felt like an eternity) until my Dad reached to unplug his phone from the wall.  Not missing a beat, my mom's cellphone (plugged in charging in her room) is ringing, although there's a number in the caller id. It was the nursing home, calling to tell her that her Father had passed away.

I've never had any ""paranormal"" experiences before, I'm undecided on the existence of ""ghosts"" or how they work, but this was just so weird and unexplainable.

Since it's true I thought I share it with you guys!

I like to think of myself as a pretty skeptical person. Someone who doesn’t claim every other, seemingly unexplainable event to be occult, just because it simply is easier to explain things when claiming the “unexplainable” being of supernatural nature. You could say that I prefer fact before fiction. Despite this, there have been times in my life, where logic and common sense just didn’t fit in.

In Sweden most people are atheists. We’re born in to the Christian church, and stay there, only to take part of the four main events the typical swede attends to during his lifetime. These are baptism, confirmation, weddings and funerals.

This story takes place at my confirmation camp. I was about 15 years old, and although most kids are in it for the celebration party (meaning presents) after the final ceremony, I actually somewhat did believe in God. This is quite irrelevant for the story though, so I’ll just skip to the strange event that took place.

It was mid-day, and I’m on my way back to the dormitory, after just having stuffed myself with a nice meal at the dining hall. I was all alone, which was quite nice after spending the last few days with people around you at all times. I was strolling, taking in that weird old smell that all old houses seems to have, and listening to the floorboards creak under my weight. It was all kind of peaceful.

To get to my room, I had to walk up a staircase, which was next to a door. No one had a clue what was behind that door, since it was closed at all times, and my guess is that no one even cared. It was just an old door, in an old house.

Without even thinking about said door, I started to walk up the stairs. As I did, there was an instant banging on the door I just mentioned. With it came a raspy, suffocating voice, which cried out “Help! Help!”. While standing there and listening, the whole procedure did repeat itself. The banging, the begging. As a 15 year old boy, in a house filled with other 15 year old pranksters, I just shrugged it off. I assumed that a couple of my friends were behind that door, trying to scare anyone who was passing by, and with that I started to walk the stairs again. Half way up, when the banging and crying for help, still hadn’t stopped; I had to second think my decision to just leave. What if there actually was someone in there, in need of aid?

With that I made my way back down the stairs. As I reached the door, I started to talk back to the person inside. I asked some basic question like “Who is this?”, “what’s wrong?” and so on. As no one answered, and the banging and the raspy voice were constant, I grabbed the handle. The door was locked.

This is where I turned to logic. If this person was truly in need, he would have responded to my questions, or at least attempted to unlock the door. After all, he was banging on it, which meant that he was right by it. Satisfied with my conclusion, I finally made my way up the stairs.

As I passed the girls dorm, I did notice that they were all worked up about something. Some of them where screaming, others hugging, and some just jumping up and down. Naturally, as the gentleman I am I asked what’s wrong. Two of the girl start repeating a story that’s identical to what I just experienced, and this is where things actually started to get really weird. It turned out that unlike me, the girls actually took the banging and cries for help really seriously. In fact they panicked and started to pull the handle as soon as they heard the noises. The door was stuck, but they were not giving up. As they repeatedly were pulling the handle and pushing the door, it finally gave in. At that very moment, the noises abruptly stopped. There were just the two girls, staring into a completely normal, totally empty, office-like room…",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_vj0x9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/vj0x9/me_a_banging_on_the_door_followed_with/,

I'm about 20 years old now, I think just under 18 at the time. It was just over the peak of summer weather here in northwestern Oklahoma (about mid august). At the time my group of friends got really into finding really creepy things around the area and going to check them out. We didn't really try to go to that many of the really haunted things, but mostly stuck to graveyards, spooky bridges, driving by abandoned houses. At one point we made our own Ouija board. Yeah I know this was  a really dumb idea, but at the very least we were smart about it and opened and closed it in the right ways, so as to not leave open a door. That's a whole nothing crazy night in itself if you guys are interested. 

So anyways, this particular incident happened over the course of a week. I had just gotten back from spending my entire summer doing Drum Corps (Professional marching band in laymans terms) and was really excited to start looking at the creepy things my friends had told me about over the summer. One in particular sounded awesome. They called it The Armory. Now it wasn't really an armory, but more a really oddly fortified house out in the middle of nowhere on some creepy, forest lined backroads. The best way to describe it would be to tell you to think of the raptor cage at the beginning of the orignal Jurassic Park, but make it about three times large and made of concrete and be attached to a huge concrete building with only one door and no windows.

Now to get to The Armory, you had to drive out about fifteen miles on an old highway, and then turn onto a mostly abandoned backroad that was lined on either side with thick forest and travel down this hilly creep-way about another three miles. When it's pitch black and there's no noise or light pollution, this can be really creepy with three teenage guys in an older toyota camry. So we're driving there, swapping creepy stories to build the mood when we get close. We slow down to maybe 5-10 miles per hour and creep on by. This thing is lit by only one streetlight that seems to be getting power from nowhere, and barely casts enough light to reach the ground. So we scan it, get thoroughly creeped, and keep going towards where our backroad meets the highway, hoping to get out without incident. 

Nope. 

About a mile down the road, there's a mild right turn, but with the trees you can't really see past it. So we're cautiously approaching, incase of another car or deer or something. When we round the corner we all stop talking and probably all stop breathing. 

In the left hand lane is a puddle, a little bigger than twice the size of our car, and no more deep than two to three inches at max. In the middle of a hill, not running, the water perfectly still, and steam pouring off of it. Not a light steam like from a heat change, but steam like you would see come off of a really hot shower in the winter. 

Around this time of year, the average daytime temperature is anywhere from 88-95ish, and at night it gets mid 70's to upper 60's. So at first we attribute this to temperature change. But then we all simultaneously realize something.

It hasn't rained in about two weeks. And this puddle is sitting perfectly still, not running or having waves from the wind at all, in the middle of an incline. 

Needless to say, we booked the fuck out of there. 

Now two days later we've recovered and decided to go out and find more creepy stuff. This time we journey to a bridge, a few cemeteries, and just other general unsettling places. But after a few hours, curiosity gets the best of us. So we decide to head back to see if our unexplained puddle is still there. 

Lo and behold, we come across the same puddle. But as we approach we slow down and take note of a few things. Not only is the puddle steaming just as badly as the previous night we visited, which is odd because it was mostly overcast (no rain though) and a lower temperature that day. But something else seems out of place, and it takes us a few moments to notice. 

The puddle is the same fucking size. No water loss can be seen. Now I don't have a degree in thermodynamics, I've taken my fair share of chemistry, and a few common laws of nature are present to my knowledge. If water has been steaming like this for two nights in a row, my scientific mind logically leads to the conclusion that the puddle should be significantly smaller. So why is this one the same size? 

At this point we're completely stopped, discussing and debating what the hell this thing could be. After a few moments we make the decision to drive through it and see what we can find. Now comes where the dumb decisions are made, luckily that lead to no ill repercussions. We stop dead center in the middle of the puddle and we all open our doors to feel the water. This is when the next puzzling thing about our mysterious water can be found. From inside the puddle, no steam can be observed. It appears like any normal puddle. Now, after we've all taken note of this, I decide to be the first to put my fingertips in. 

The water is ice cold. Not like, it's cold compared to the atmosphere, so I think it's colder than it actually is. No. This water is seriously as cold as water that is about to turn to ice. When I pull my fingertips out, the warm from the atmosphere actually caused steam to rise from them. It was as cold as a water I had just purchased from a local convenient store that had actual ice in it. Once again, we noped the fuck out. 

Now forward again another two days. We decide we're going to try and take some water, and bring a thermometer to actually measure the temperature of the water. Now mind you, at this point my area had been almost three weeks without a rainfall, so the fact that this water was still there and still retained it's size goes beyond every kind of scientific fact I know about water, especially considering it's still getting to be about 95 on average during the day, in a relatively sunny area. So we know there is something not right about this water. 

Night comes, and we pile into the camry. Only this time it's just me and one other friend. He's driving, I'm riding shotgun. We decide to try and be cheerful on the way, playing some Cudi and jamming along, because things may get creepy fast. We turn on the backroad, drive past the cemetery, creepy towards the bend in the road, and once we round the tree line we slam on our brakes. No water. The entire puddle is gone. No sign of it at all. No steam, no wet spot, nothing. We instant both get chills in our spine and decide it would be best to call it a night. The fastest way back is to turn around, because the highway is about four more miles ahead, and it's about a ten mile drive around to where the backroad we're on starts once we hit the highway. So we flip a bitch, and start heading back towards the highway, ready to end our creepy night.

Nope. 

About a mile or so down the road, the same road we had just travelled down, we slam on our brakes once again. In the middle of the road is a fresh animal skin. We both want to book it, but I let my curiosity get the best of me and say we should drive up to it, stop and look. He puts it on my side, and I open my door. It's a fresh deer skin, still warm and bloody. But it's almost perfectly intact. There's only one cut, perfectly centered down the underside. 

But all of the features are still attached. The antlers, the hooves, the nose, the fucking eyes, even the fucking mouth is perfectly there. We had literally been this way no more than seven minutes ago, and we'd seen no cars come down after us. And there's no way a person could have skinned a deer this way anyways. This only increased the speed of us noping the fuck out. 

Definitely one of the more creepy experiences in my life.

This is my first story here and sorry if it’s not perfect but this is my story regarding my old house and odd experiences. I wrote a bit jumpy but it’s my thought process so bear with me. I think a little 
background should be in order first. 

The house is in West Chester, PA and was built in the 1940’s I believe. In the 1960’s my grandmother woke up to her husband having a heart attack and knew he wasn’t going to make it. The only other person in the house was her daughter Lillian. She ran into her room to get help for her husband and found Lillian face down dead in her pillow. Lillian has severe epilepsy and would have seizures a few times a day, so it seems she suffocated herself during one of her attacks.  By the time my grandmother got back to her husband he has passed. I enclosed a clipping from the newspaper .Around this time my mother came to live with her and I was born in 1985. In the house was just my mom, grandma and me. My father left when I was 5.

One of my first memories was when I was around 5/6 years old. I use to sleep in the bed with my grandmother and she would get up often during the night to go to the bathroom. Well one night I felt the bed rise up and creak as if she sat and stood up. I was awake at the time facing the opposite direction so started to turn and ask her to get me a glass of milk. I got half of the sentence out before I froze. At the window in the bedroom was a woman standing, looking outside. She had medium brown hair and had on a pink or red flowery nightgown. The odd part which I couldn’t understand now or at the time was she was facing away from me but I knew her face was sad and just looking out into the yard. I was a little scared but that’s more from the shock the actual feeling I got was that I was seeing a picture in time not anything I could interact with.  Later I saw a picture of Lillian whom I was named after and it was the same look. It seems Lillian had such bad epilepsy she couldn’t leave the house and couldn’t even get the mail due to crossing the street. She died at the age of 29 never having a boyfriend and never being able to leave which must have been a horrible life. I have her diary and every day she wrote about drinking coffee and watching TV. For 4 years it was almost the same entry every day. Also growing up I found books in the backroom which were hers, she loved science and in the pages would be newspaper clippings about hopeful cures for epilepsy. I never saw her again but felt sadness a lot there.

Now the house was falling apart around this time. The bathtub was sinking into the floor and was unusable. Also we didn’t have heat so winter was hell. For showers I use to have to boil water and put half hot half cold in a jug. Four jugs would usually do the job of bathing and I would either go outside after midnight so no one would see me or in the basement which was a concrete floor and was caving in a few places so the water would drain.  There was also no toilet or outhouse so…. Yeah it was same basement or outside.  My mother was basically a dirty hoarder. She would eat and throw food and trash right onto the floor next to her. I would attempt to clean and so would my grandma but it was no use she would keep doing it. We had around 5 cats and 5 dogs and the dogs were pretty much trained to go outside but the cats were not. I remember my mom would just put newspaper down for them and it was horrible because she wouldn’t clean it up. This was how I grew up I felt it was wrong but at the time didn’t understand how horrible. It didn’t help my mom was extremely emotionally abusive and physical enough so I lived in fear. The house itself also had me in fear.

There would be night I would wake up to heavy footsteps walking up and down the hallway and stop at my door. This happened for a few years and I would be terrified. I knew my mom was at work (third shift) and I was in the same room with my f] grandma so I never knew what it was but knew it was bad. Even now I feel chills thinking about it because I knew whatever it was. Also there was a huge old mirror in the hallway I would have to pass after turning out the lights for the night. It was so old the glass had odd warping and stains but I was freaked out by it. Even now I have a fear of mirrors because in that old one I would see shadows of people.
Growing up in the house besides the horrible conditions I was always scared of the place. My grandmother got dementia when I was 7 and I took care of her till then up until I was 14, when she left it got worse. I was always in fear and around that age practiced Wicca for a little and would do protection spells and cleansing and had trouble doing them in the house. I would just feel negative energy and would do them outside. I wound up leaving the house at 18 and now live far away in Georgia.

I am currently trying to sell the land because the house is condemned with my mom who I no longer speak to and the place was boarded up but my best friend visited it the other day and found it open. Here are the pics she took. One is the front stairs which are collapsing. The other is a pic of the outside back door wide open oddly. The wooden table is holding the door open my friend said but I have no clue where it’s from since I have never seen it before. The one looking down the stairs is the basement. You can still see water jugs used for bathing also on the left hand side the wall is collapsing that is actually where the bathroom is on the other side and where the bathtub is coming thorough. The last one is looking into my kitchen. Sadly it seems the clutter is plastic food bowls used to feed cats and empty cans and bags of food. It’s a good example of how my mother keeps things and sadly this is clean for her because the floor is actually visible… I assure you it would be fucking layers of trash. This picture also creeped out my friend she said she sees an outline of a person and I have showed it to a few people and they say they see images in the background. I would love to know what others might be seeing. Mainly in this pic. but any if you catch something I missed. Now when she took the kitchen pic she said nothing was on the wall or room when the camera went off. She really wanted to go further but was alone and felt scared. The house currently is abandoned to my knowledge so no idea why its opened up.
One last tidbit my friend who took the pics last week was also who helped me get out of the house. We have known each other since 1st grade and when I was 18 saw it for the first time; afterwards she would have horrible nightmares for months after.
Sorry again if I droned on just this is my first time getting It all out so thanks all for reading  Any questions you might have please ask and remember let me know if you see anything odd in the pics.

1331667207.0,49,self.Thetruthishere,quyuy,"New Mod, New Direction, and a stronger community.",MrMagpie,56,7,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/quyuy/new_mod_new_direction_and_a_stronger_community/,"Good morning, I'm Mr. Magpie. How are we today?

I am the new Mod for /r/thetruthishere. Now, you ask, why should you care? well, maybe you shouldn't. But I won't just be another name on the sidebar there -&gt; Not only do I really love (hate) these stories, I also feel a certain attachment to this little subreddit. I am pretty much always on it. And I’ve also had my share of messed up experiences which I have shared before, then deleted. I'm working on posting 'em again.  I, like many of you here, first arrived after /r/nosleep took a turn for the worst. I was there since the beginning of the subreddit, and I watched it become something amazing, and then get tarnished horribly. I know I am not alone in this.

We're not an /r/nosleep spin-off. Believe it or not, not everything you read is true. In fact, people are pretty deceiving. Why should you buy everything they say?

The most chilling part of this subreddit is, to me, just how understated everything is. You hear chilling tales but they are told as if they were mundane. Now, why is that? Because that's real life. Life isn't flashy, it's not like the movies. Life is dirty, shameful, ugly, cold, and boring. Life is understated. Life is our ""default state"", and when someone breaks from it, you can tell.

I know we aren't entirely immune to ""false stories,"" but damned am I not proud of you guys for sticking to your guns, but most of all, being respectful. I love this small community of skeptics who believe, or people who have seen so many ghosts by now that they consider it second nature. I see this and recognize it for what it is: a great opportunity.

Lets grow this subreddit. **My goal for this subreddit is to create a safe haven for people with real stories**. We know ghosts don't pick the most exciting, or convenient times to show up. We know that we're not all storytellers. And most of all, we all know how it sounds, and how it makes you feel when you share a trauma and are met with cold, unbelieving looks. We get it. I get it. I am one of you.

So, what are we gonna do to improve this? First of all, allow me to clarify: I don't want this to be a monster of a subreddit. I want this to be a gem, a small subreddit with a tight community, and extremely entertaining posts. I want us to be a gem you find and spend hours reading. We are kinda like that. It just needs some polish. 

So here are my ideas:

- **Crossposts are encouraged.** I know you have probably figured it out by now, but let me clarify. We strongly recommend that you repost any stories, or posts, you feel belong here. If the stories belong to you, crosspost them yourself. If they were posted by someone else, feel free to ask them to post it. I have done it before, and as long as you are polite about it and explain yourself, it works. That is one way to grow our subreddit. We don't mind being an archive for real, chilling stories. I have other ways of bringing original content here. 

I need you guys for this next part: We should start crossposting all the humongous, amazing /r/askreddit creepy threads as they show up. They are typically titled something similar to ""what is your creepiest, scariest experience?"" I believe we should post them (but only if they hit the front page) and then, in the comments, we can discuss our favorite stories, or point out buried gems. Those posts exceed the thousands of comments. Point out any good ones we may have missed. Here's an example of such a thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bhbyx/reddit_what_is_your_creepiest_most_unnerving/

Which brings me to my next point, haven't you noticed how many ""seemingly normal"" people come out of the woodwork to share their stories, stories they would not have shared if someone hadn't asked?

- **How do I contribute new, original content to the subreddit?** It's quite simple, actually. In fact, some of you have already done it, or thought about doing it but haven't. **Ask**. Ask your mom, ask your dad, your uncles, grandmas, teachers, etc. Ask them all if they have ever had an experience that may belong here. You will be surprised at how many trustworthy people have stories buried deep in their psyche. Once you do that, come back here and share it. You may use the **FAM/FR** tag, or you can use a new one, called **HW** which goes for ""homework"". Don't worry too much about the tag, though, but it will help everyone know just how much this works. This idea has me pretty excited. If at least a few of you go out and do this, we should see some new, original stories here consistently. And you will get to learn something about a family member or friend that you couldn't have guessed. Win-win. What's the worst that can happen? Maybe the family member laughing at you and telling you there's no such thing. But then, you can just smile slyly and pat their heads. Ok maybe not. But I'd like to emphasize, just give it a shot! This is your chance to not only get your own creepy story, but to contribute to this subreddit, something I know many of you are eager to do. You get all the glory with none of the traumas! yayyy!

Now, another point I'd like to bring up is the lack of discussion here. 

- **Why are you guys so afraid of asking questions?** We are sitting on a PILE of true stories with messed up implications. Together they paint a picture of a world much different than what most people perceive. I know you guys are curious, so why don't you ask more questions? And **OPs, please try to encourage discussion by answering questions to your posts.** You aren't forced to answer, but many things make us curious, and we'd appreciate your answer. Plus its a shame to see an amazing story with few comments. But only you can change that.

We are a small subreddit. **Your votes make a difference.** The difference between a story with 1 upvote and one with 5 is that one story's OP can at least know his/her story was appreciated. If you read a story and like it, please vote! If you wanna read more stories, please vote! I gotta tell you, it's discouraging to relive your traumas, post a story, and get absolutely nothing but a couple of upvotes. If you upvote, comment, show interest, they will maybe share any other stories they have, or feel encouraged to stick around.

/r/nosleep grew by word of mouth. That is the only way I'd like us to grow. Spread the word, but do it wisely. Don't do it unsolicited. And ensure they are aware that we do not take kindly to false stories. This is an endlessly fascinating topic, a topic that eludes most minds. And it's not because its complex. Its because it is so damned rare. But here, here we have a collection of stories by people who have experienced these rare events. This is just about the best place to satisfy your curiosity for these ""things"". I would like to make sure it stays that way. But we can only do it with your help.

**Everyone likes the truth. Especially when it comes to this. No bull allowed here. Just the undiluted, sometimes raw, truth. That is key to this subreddit.**

Now, lets take this opportunity to make your voice heard! Have at it! Let me know your opinions on this or anything else, or just simply speak your mind!

**If you wish to make any suggestions, now is the time** to do so with an audience. You can also message me or any of the mods at any time. Best way to do it is through modmail.

**EDIT:** BUT WAIT, there's more! **Flair**. What do you guys think of us implementing user flair? For now, the idea is to use it as method of recognition or reward for posters. I was thinking, just now in fact, that we can maybe have some ranks for frequent contributors? And/or a special tag for people who participate in the ""homework"" project? I would need your opinion on this. Please chime in!

Here's what **Voodomoocow [M]** has to say about flair. What do you think?

&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/quyuy/new_mod_new_direction_and_a_stronger_community/c40s4cq

and **FireJellyPenguin** has made the following proposal:

&gt;I have a few other stories, but they're not that interesting so I wouldn't put them in their own thread, but I (and possibly others) may be more inclined to share the small things in a generic thread devoted to something like ""Have you ever been visited by a deceased family member?"" or ""What was your first spooky experience?"". Maybe a theme of the week along those lines would encourage the sharing of small stories, and possibly jog memories?

http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/quyuy/new_mod_new_direction_and_a_stronger_community/c40w18x

I love the idea, what do you guys think? Let us know!

But I did experience it, and so fuck-it. It's part of my life and I know what I saw and felt, and apart from my girlfriend, who was indirectly involved, I've never discussed it with anyone. I am 42 years old, have had a hard-scrabble life, and never thought for one moment that I would go through this.

Disclaimer: The following is pretty mild compared to other reports here.

I was with my girlfriend in the Liberities in Dublin, on a bright early summer's day last year. We went to a pub for a pint (if anyone is interested I'll specify the pub, privately.) We were entirely sober. We got our drinks, sat down, and I two minutes later had to piss. The toilets were downstairs basement level, as many small Dublin pubs are.

 This is hard to write, so bear with me. I went down the stairs and turned right into the men's toilet. A urinal ran along the length of the toilet wall, and I walked to the furthest end away from the door (as you do), and began pissing. Bear in mind that this was a small Dublin pub, and the toilets reflected that - I was maybe four foot away from the door. As I was pissing, the door moved almost imperceptibly, and I of course took no notice - draughts etc etc. I was looking down at myself, as you do, when I became aware that someone was in the room with me. I, and this is something I find difficult to countenance, was acutely aware that someone/something was right next to me. This all happened in seconds as I finished pissing. I looked to my right and not two feet away from me was - I don't know how to describe it. A black, amorphous shadow or shape, that wasn't a property of the physicality around me. In ways I can't describe, this thing was sensile and knew I was there. To my dying day, I will swear this is true. Every hair on my body stood up, and this thing was there with me. Like I said, this was a matter of seconds. I was being regarded. In one second I was out the door and up the stairs to the sunlit pub. My girlfriend saw me immediatley. I was ashen-faced and starting to cry, and she knew straight away that something was fucked. I don't cry easily, and I swear to you that what happened that day struck me to my very core, and unsettled me entirely. As an addendum, I asked the landlord if there was a history of such stuff there and he said no. And if you know the pubs in the Liberties, you know how courageous it was of me to ask that. They do not fuck around.

I have since given more credence to others' stories, but still have difficulty reconciling what I experienced with my worldview.

But it's confused our family for years since it happened. If anyone can offer an explanation, it would be really great.*

This happened a really long time ago, I must have been about 8 or 9. It was back in the days when my dad used to work a job he hated and wouldn't come home until late, when my mum, sister and I would already be eating supper. 

So, one evening, the three of us are at the dinner table and we hear the same familiar noises we hear every night: keys in the lock, door opening, feet shuffling on the mat, tired 'hello!', and footsteps up the hall. All three of us shouted 'hello!' back to him.

I'd remembered that I'd gotten a good grade in school, so I got up from the table and ran up the hall shouting to my dad that I wanted to show him something. I remember my mum telling me to wait until he got to the table, cause he wouldn't be long getting changed out of his work clothes. I ignored her, and so I got to his room but he wasn't there. I was confused, so I checked the living room. Nothing. Shouted and shouted. Nothing. 

Went back to my sister and my mum and told them I couldn't find him. Mum thought he might have gone to the attic or something, and I should just wait until he got to the table to show him my work. 

About 10 minutes later, we hear the keys in the lock, door opening, feet shuffling on the mat, tired 'hello!', and footsteps up the hall. The three of us stare at each other, really confused. When he gets to the table we ask him why he'd just come into the house twice. He had no idea what we were talking about, he'd literally just come home. The three of us had heard him come home already 10 minutes earlier and had shouted 'hello' to him. We've been confused about this ever since. 

TL;DR - Me, mum and sister all hear our dad come home. I go to talk to him but he's not there. 10 minutes later we hear him come home again. He has no idea what we're talking about. 


Oh: He wasn't the kind of person to joke with us. As I said, he hated his job and got home late every night. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1eni6h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1eni6h/me_fam_we_heard_him_come_home/,
1364034113.0,48,self.Thetruthishere,1aupyn,[ME][FAM][FR] Weird occurences in the house I grew up in,renwickveleros,59,11,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1aupyn/mefamfr_weird_occurences_in_the_house_i_grew_up_in/,"This is my first post to Reddit so bear with me if there are formatting problems or something. First I'll just give some background. I grew up in a suburb of Cleveland, OH. The house I grew up in was not very old; I think it was built in the 1950's or so. Only one family had owned it before us. If I remember correctly it was a local realtor who was selling a bunch of the houses and used the house as an office as well.

 The only weird thing about the house were some weird windows and ""peep holes"" in certain locations that were odd. For example there was a hidden window in built in book case that looked into the garage. I asked my mom about this and she told me that the previous owner was somewhat paranoid and would use the windows to check on her kids when they were outside playing.

Growing up there everyone in my family had weird experiences there. I can tell you mine and my sisters. Whenever I ask my brother he says ""I don't even want to talk about it and gets pretty upset."" I'm pretty skeptical about supernatural things and always look for a natural explanation but some of the stuff that happened defied anything I can explain.

I can't remeber a lot of things in my early childhood but I remeber being scared of being upstairs in my bedroom and scared to go in the basement...but that happens with lots of little kids. The first distinct weird experience that I had happened around age 13 or so. I was sitting alone at home reading a book and the doorbell started ringing. Nobody was at any of the doors but what was weirder than that was that the house didn't have a doorbell. If we did I could chalk it up to faulty wiring and be done with it.

The next weird thing that happened occured when I was around 16 or so. There were two bathrooms in the house as well as a stand alone shower in the basement. With three teenage kids in the house the bathrooms were almost always occupied at inconvenient times (before school, etc.). I was the only one who would go in the basement and use the shower down there. One day I came home from work and was taking a shower and I heard a voice whisper my name right in my ear. I could feel the breath on my face. This also happened to other family members down there and that's why they wouldn't go down there.

My sister also refused to sleep in her bedroom at night. She said that shadow people would surround her bed and watch her sleep. Her room was the biggest one in the house so I ended up switching rooms with her to get it. I never saw anything in there however.

The next few experiences are where it gets bizarre. I was hanging out with one of my friends and my girlfriend. We were around 16-17 at the time. We decided to play around with a Ouija board. I know about the ideomotor effect and I don't really believe  in them much. I was using the board with my girlfriend and the board spelled out that it was ""Nelly Gale who had died in a fire.""  My girlfriend said ""Screw you stop pushing it around"". I told her I wasn't  and she said ""Oh yeah if you're real then do something. At exactly that moment an ironing board flew from one side of the room to the other and crashed into the wall.

I saved the weirdest one for last. I was hanging out with a female friend and a male friend of mine in my brothers room. The female friend was kind of into new age stuff and nonsense like that. Somehow the topic of ghosts came up. She was saying that there are cold spots in my house and that means that people died there or something. I became upset and told her she was an idiot and it just meant we had a drafty house.  

Then my female friend looked at me really weird and said ""Whoa, you're glowing"". To which I replied ""what's wrong with you. I am not."" To which my male friend said ""Yeah, I see it too it's like glowing stuff all around you."" I couldn't see it so I told him to stop messing with me. He said ""Seriously, I'm telling the truth. I'm going to touch it"".

The moment he reached out to touch whatever it was all of us heard the most awful sound coming from the air vents in the house. It sounded  like men and women screaming in pain, babies crying, etc. basically like people being tortured. It was definitely NOT a mechanical furnace malfunction because furnaces do not have the ability to speak last time I checked. That scared us so much we all ran out of the house. 

Needless to say my friends wanted to go home but my male friend was diabetic and had left his diabetes supplies in my room so we had to go back and get them. We went back inside and went upstairs. All the lights were off and my friend went in and grabbed his supplies. I couldn't see anything in there. All of a sudden he rushes out of the room and pushes me down the hallway saying ""Run!"". 

When we got back outside he said that there was something in the room with him that attacked him. He said he couldn't see what it was because it was completely black and it was dark.* He showed me his hand and he had bite marks on it. There were two rows of teeth marks. The first looked like human teeth  marks and the second looked like little ""needle like"" teeth marks. THey were deep enough to draw blood. Then he lifted up his shirt and on his back there were scratch marks that looked like they were made by something with three talons.

I drove him home and he was very tense and quiet. Later he told me that on the drive home he had the strange urge to strangle me and drive the car off the road into a tree. He said that he thinks being bitten by that thing made him have those thoughts.

I don't know what to make of all that but I swear it's true and witnessed by many people. There are other weird occurances there and the place always had a weird feeling to it but nothing else like this stuff ever happened again.

If you have any questions feel free to ask. Thanks for reading.

TLDR- I grew up in a weird house where there were voices and things getting thrown around. Something attacked and bit my friend.

he says, I was laying there trying to fall asleep and i heard a strange voice whisper ,""I'll get the one on the left""

I didn't hear it. no one else did...but i want to say i was already asleep at that point as well as his friend.  

What do you guys think? I wonder what he meant by getting the one on the left? and what would have happened if he hadn't heard it? but yeah, just another one of the many ghost encounters that happened to us.

Back when I was a sophmore in highschool (2005-2006), I had a class in the school's second oldest building, which we called, “the old main”. The building was built in the 1930's, I believe, and was legally condemned while I was attending school there. The year this took place happened to be the last year there were any students allowed in the building. So yes, this was an old building at an even older school (opened in the 1910's), and this highschool had legends of ghosts, as any old school does, and a few documented deaths on campus (a plane crash [saw the bodies myself], a girl fell down a long set of stairs, and a homeless man hung himself). But besides the floorboards creaking, the windows not being safe to open, and the constant feeling that it would collapse at any moment, there was nothing particularly odd or creepy about the building. 

So... during a normal class period, between noon and 2:00pm, my teacher gave me keys and asked me to get some more copies of the book we were assigned to read from a storage closet at the end of the hallway. When I went in the storage room, I noticed that it was connected to a long, tile-floored, hallway. Not knowing this room was there, and thinking I'd never see it again, I wandered in. I felt uneasy the moment my foot went from the carpet to the tile. The only window was an old skylight, so everything in it was a cold, blue, hue. This hallway was taller than the rest of the rooms on this floor of the building; guessing by the skylight, the attic just didn't extend over this room. The only other things I remember about it is that there were old overhead monitors and other classroom furnishings in it, and that there were drains in the floor. I assumed it was just some weird, old chem lab or something and went back to class with the books. Nothing unusual happened the rest of the class period.

After class, I went down the stairs and outside to lunch, I think, and as I rounded the corner of the building it occurred to me that I should see what this hallway looked like from the outside. 
It wasn't there. Where it should have been was just air. I could see in the windows of the last classroom on the hallway, and the windows into a hallway in the adjoined building, which if the room I found had been visible, would have been impossible to see. These two buildings shared an interior wall and formed a rough “L” shape. This bizarre hallway would have been in the interior 90 degree angle of the “L”.

I am sure that the windows on the adjoining building (the district office at the time and the original building of the school), went to a different a hallway. The hallway that could be seen from the outside had pictures hanging in it, and I recognized them from when we, in choir, would walk down it to sing at the yearly holiday district staff party. The hallway I had been in earlier had no pictures.

I've explained this room to other classmates, and none of them have known what I'm talking about. I've gone back to this school every once-in-a-while, usually to play capture the flag at night, and I always avoid being close to where this hallway should be; it just creeps me out too much. 

 Has anyone ever experienced a place like this, or know what kind of architectural tricks are being pulled here?

This took place several years ago, in 2010 if I’m not mistaken.   I worked at a private daycare in the middle of the city. [Here it is for those who are interested.](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2335/2091264692_6f1b0a98f3_z.jpg) We were based out of a super old church building and the place had a bad reputation among teachers and some members of the church staff for being haunted.  I heard my fair share of stories and saw weird things, but nothing stands out like this one particular event.  

There were three floors we used, and the bottom floor was a weird ballroom/industrial kitchen combo.  It was used for random things like the Christmas pageant and Thanksgiving dinner, but otherwise people stayed out due to the creeptacular vibe and the darkness.  I have several stories that happened in this place but again, nothing to top what I’m about to tell you.  Of all the teachers, very few including myself would go into the basement alone.  But sometimes we had to go because the big industrial kitchen came in very handy, even though it was creepy as all fuck.  Think like, the kitchen from the Shining or the Jurassic Park raptor scene.  

I had just celebrated Chinese New Year that day with the class and we had an awesome time eating rice, drinking tea, learning to use chopsticks, etc.  The downside was a mountainous stack of dishes that needed an industrial-sized sink to wash.  I waited until the center closed (six pm) and then took the dishes down to the basement.  I had one of those wheely cart things that waiters use, to make the multiple stacks of bowls and cups easier to carry in one go.  Commence Teacher Cleanup.  The ballroom lights were off and I didn’t bother with turning them on because hey, I’m not a pussy.

The water was running, the dishes were flying into and out of the sink, (which was right next to the large swinging doors out into the ballroom) and after the sink was full enough I turned the water off to focus on scrubbing.  That\s when I heard the whispering.  It sounded like a woman’s tiny voice, and she was whispering excitedly, like when you whisper so fast your voice goes up and down and almost isn’t a whisper at times.  It sounded like she was outside in the ballroom.  

So, a little annoyed I yelled out, “HELLO?”  

Whispering stopped.  

I started washing dishes faster, but heard the whispering sound again.  It started up right as it had before.  I remember wondering if it was a random staff member screwing with me or something, but nobody really had that kind of humor and they were all too scared to come downstairs in the dark anyway.  It just sounded like someone was in the corner whispering to themselves, as it was distinctly one voice.  This weird image popped in my head of a woman in victorian dress and hat sitting there whispering.  I was freaking myself out.  So I paused again and yelled out super loud, “GO AWAYYYY!”

Whispering stopped.

And then it started again, and it was even more fervent and chaotic sounding, like the fastest whispering I’ve ever heard.  I don’t even think a human could whisper that fast.  And then the sound of the voice moved, and I heart soft footfalls on the carpet.  The floor of the ballroom is hollow so even the tiniest steps go with an echo.  The footsteps and whispers were crossing the ballroom floor and coming toward the kitchen.  

The thing is, I am not afraid, even of paranormal happenings.  I am more of the kind of person who WANTS to see them, because I find them fascinating.  I am not afraid of the dark either, or being alone.  Up until this point I had only halfway considered that this might be something not human, but then this strange primal fear suddenly hit me.  It was like my instincts were screaming YOU NEED TO GET OUT, NOW.  I’ve rarely felt that fear in my life and only one other time, so strongly.  I immediately listened and grabbed the waiting cart and busted through the double doors. I couldn’t even look in the direction of that corner.  Not that it would have helped probably, basements tend to be dark as fuck when there’s no light on.  I just made a beeline left, toward the elevator, and the worst part: I could hear the footsteps and whispers change direction.  They had been moving toward the kitchen, but now shifted and came after me in the hallway.  The cart was loud and creaky and rumbling full of dishes and I could still hear the other noises so they were louder.  I crossed the hallway and pretty much threw myself into the elevator and started mashing the close button.
 
Now the noises were fading: they were still audible but lowering in volume, but they were still coming toward me.  The fear I felt as I looked at the dark corner and waited for something to cross it was so intense, the only thing matching it was the relief I felt when the doors closed.  The elevator rumbled and shook and didn’t go up for a few moments, but we had always considered that “the ghost” and nobody paid it any attention anymore.  

I did go back down to the basement alone after that, and I took my class a lot as well, and we all had several creepy things happen to us, but this is the end of this story.  ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1jpohd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1jpohd/the_whispering_lady_me/,

She unfortunately passed a few years ago, but I certainly won't be forgetting her.

I just want to provide some context for what might be the most strangely mundane paranormal story you've read today.

When I was a young teenager, my aunt took my siblings and me to Burger King. We told her what we wanted and she ordered for us. The person behind the counter offered to upsize our drinks for some kind of deal, and I spontaneously thought, ""Why waste the money? Free refills on any size."" As soon as I thought this, she ordered the drinks in a small size. I was pleased that my silent advice to myself had been taken. As we sat down at the table, my aunt said ""I heard what you said about the drinks, good idea."" I was completely shocked. I DEFINITELY did not say anything about the drinks, I just had a thought. My impulsive teenager reaction was to just out front state that I didn't say anything about the drinks and had only thought about them. She managed to drop the subject entirely as if she had never made the comment in the first place, master of words as she was.

This was a year and a half ago.  Background: My Dad has been diabetic for years and his condition has been getting worse and worse. He lost his eyesight when he was 39 and then at 41 he could barely walk without assistance.

One night my sister went to say goodnight to him in his bed and found him frothing at the mouth and unresponsive.  She called 911 and then me.  I was at school (I usually stayed until 11PM) and rushed straight to the hospital to meet them.  My Dad was conscious when I got there but still confused at how he got to the hospital.  

When we were alone he told me what had happened to him, that he didn't remember even going to sleep.

It was a normal night with my siblings in their rooms and my Dad in the living room listening to the news.  He said that the sound of the news started to sound like a buzz and he was aware that he wasn't alone in the living room.  He called out to my brother and sister but they didn't answer.

Then he realized he wasn't blind anymore.  He could see everything in the living room and it looked the same as when we first moved in years ago.  He looked for what was in the room with him and saw it:  a great black shape breathing hard and moving from the kitchen and into the living room straight for him.  His legs were the same so every attempt to lift himself off the couch was useless.

He remembered a sharp, intense fear.  He was suffocating under the weight of the mass. He couldn't fight it and started to feel weaker and weaker as it pressed upon him.

When he thought he had lost all hope he suddenly found that he could breathe again.  He looked up and between him and the black shape was his mom.  She died of cancer 15 years ago.  He said she pulled him up by his shoulder and shoved him towards his bedroom. Told him to go and that it wasn't his time yet.  She said how much she loved him and that she was crying.

Next thing he knew he was being pushed into the hospital on a stretcher.

The doctors told us his body had gone into shock from kidney failure and it was a miracle he wasn't dead.  He had been steadily gaining weight over the past few weeks and we seriously thought it was because of his eating habits and inactivity.  Turns out he needed to start dialysis that night.  Over the course of 8 days they pulled ~100lbs of fluid out of his body.

After reading some of these posts, I am honestly a bit too scared to leave my room right now. I know that is irrational. I've always been very open minded to the paranormal. I've only had one experience that I truly could not explain. It isn't particularly scary, just something that has bothered me for years.

I was in my 7th period class in 6th grade (last class of the day) and I had left one of my books under my desk in my 6th period class. I had asked my teacher if I could leave the class a few minutes early to run and grab the book so that I wouldn't be late to get on my bus. 

The class room my book was in was located in another building across a large courtyard with a covered central walkway. It was a few minutes before the bell, and I went outside. There were post-it notes EVERYWHERE. Like, so many of them. My initial thought was that this was some sort of project done by some of the older students. Like, they were all over the place. Some were blowing in the wind. Some were on the ground. I looked down at a few of them, they all had the name Darius on them and were saying different things about this person. I don't have any real relevance for that name other than a cartoon I remember from a long time ago that I never watched. 

The court yard was mostly empty. I remembered seeing one of my friends out there. There was also a girl walking by that I knew. She said something to me while she was walking by but I wasn't paying attention to her and honestly do not remember what she said to me.

I'm an extremely skeptical person, and there was no reason to believe anything paranormal about this whatsoever. So, I continued walking and entered the building to get my book. 

When I came back out of the building, all of the paper was gone. I had stood outside the classroom for 2 minutes tops, waiting on the bell to ring so I could go in and get my book. When I went out, students were everywhere but there was not a SINGLE piece of paper. My friend that had been in the courtyard was nearby and I asked him what happened to all of the paper. He said ""What paper?""

I went and got on my bus and didn't talk the rest of the day. This is the only way I know it wasn't a dream. I remember how the rest of that day was for me. It's just so weird. It isn't even a ghost story. Just tons of paper that shouldn't be there, talking about things that make no sense to me, and then it's gone and no one saw anything.

 I wish I had kept one of the pieces of paper as proof. But the appearance of the paper was not so startling as the disappearance of it. I remember being confused as hell the rest of the day. I have no idea what happened that day. It makes no sense. There was no purpose. But I know it happened and I will never be able to explain what the hell even happened or why.

I'm not really here looking for advice or what this might be. I honestly would rather not know about stuff like this. But my curiosity gets the better of me, and if any of you have ever had something strange like this happen, I would like to hear about it.

** Edit:** After many comments, I want to state that the two babysitters are in fact Greek Orthodox and speak fluent Greek. The nativity shelf is part of their and the childrens' religion. The timestamps were also my friends' suggestion to map out the progression of events (obviously they weren't holding a timer the whole night, but they remember the events vividly with approximate times). Also, it is written descriptively because their telling of it is descriptive. I think the writing style brings the audience into the experience and enhances how terrifying the night was.

Two parents offer 18 year-old Jane the chance to babysit. Jane jumps at the chance, already having babysat for the parents before. They have two little girls, Ellie (who is 3) and Sarah (who is 8). They live in a nice, suburban home in a well-respected neighborhood.


Jane shows up at 7:00 and sends the parents off on their date. The girls play some and are then sent to bed. Their separate bedrooms are upstairs, and Jane tucks both in before walking back downstairs to the living room. She sits on the couch, flips on the baby-monitor, and watches some TV.


**8:00pm.** - The lights in the living room turn off. Jane looks behind her at the switches on the wall, and notices they are still in the on position. She assumes there must be a motion-detector that turns the lights on/off. She turns the lights back off/on and continues watching TV.


**8:10pm.** - The lights go off again. This time, she's a little confused. It's not been reasonably long enough for the lights to turn off... and why would they do that in the TV room, of all places? She turns them back on. 


**8:20pm.** - She goes to the kitchen for a drink. She notices the lights for the backyard are on. Jane knows they were off when the parents left, because the parents had turned them off... Strange. The lights are flicked off and Jane goes back to the TV room.


**8:25pm.** -  Jane feels watched, like someone is breathing down her back as she sits on the couch. She gets up, turns the TV down, and positions herself on a corner of the couch. Somehow having her back face the corner makes her feel safer...


**8:30pm.** - The lights turn off again. Jane is sufficiently creeped! When she flips the lights back on again the baby monitor goes wild. The 3-year old, Ellie, is screaming bloody murder in her room. Jane rushes upstairs and see's her in her crib, laying down flat and screaming. She must be having a nightmare.


**8:35pm.** - Jane manages to calm the child down, tells her she's had a nightmare, and puts her back to bed. She checks on the older sibling, Sarah, and see's that she was sleeping like a doll. Shutting the bedroom doors halfway, she goes back downstairs to the living room.


**8:50pm.** - A strange scraping noise, almost like metal dragging, can be heard in the backyard. Jane is terrified and alone. She goes to look outside and the lights are on again... she didn't turn those lights on... and she can't see anything out there making the noise. They must be motion-detected, right? The noise isn't stopping... Jane calls her sister,  Kate, to come over. She's afraid to be in the house alone right now. While waiting for her sister, Jane locks all the doors and windows in the house. She even checks the garage, which is closed, and sees that nothing is out of place. 


**9:15pm.** - Kate arrives and rings the doorbell. She calls Jane a wimp and proceeds to the living room to do homework. They're both sitting on the couches, and Jane tries to explain the lights and the scary noises. Kate isn't having it.


**9:30pm.** - The scraping noise is back... This time Kate goes to check it out. In the kitchen, she see's that the backyard is pitch black. As she approaches the kitchen window, a holy cross hanging on the cabinet falls to the floor. Kate runs back to the living room. 


**9:35pm.** - The baby monitor is making weird noises... it's static and strange scrapings... they turn it off. If they can hear upstairs from where they are, they don't really need the monitor. 


**9:40pm.** - Kate, who was writing an assignment, stops suddenly. Jane looks over, and asks what's wrong. Kate stares, amazed, and asks if Jane can hear that. Obviously Jane can't, and tells her to stop fucking around trying to scare her. Kate starts humming a tune, and says that she hears piano playing in the house. She shakes her head and says nevermind.


**9:45pm.** - Jane, who was watching TV, puts a hand to her mouth. She says she hears piano playing, and wants to know if Kate hears it. Kate doesn't hear a thing... Jane hums the same tune... 


**9:50pm.** - Screaming, blood-curdling screams come from the 3-year old's room. Jane takes out her cell phone, shaking with fear, and presses video record. Her and Kate bolt up the stairs, and Jane films as they find the little girl.


**9:52pm.** - Ellie is in bed, legs and arms out wide, her eyes completely open, and an endless scream spilling from her tiny lips. Kate grabs the child, trying to pick her up, but her limbs are bone stiff. They try to comfort her, but she isn't stopping her screams. Suddenly, the little girl starts bending, really jerky motions as her arms and legs twist. Kate tries to hold her down, thinking she must be having a seizure of sorts. 


**9:55pm.** - There is a Greek nativity hanging above the bed. The children's parents are Orthodox, and display small icons and a bottle of holy water on a little shelf above the crib. Kate grabs the holy water and begins to uncap it, telling the girl to take a sip. The girl is screaming even worse, a dark, deep, guttural shriek coming from a tiny 3-year old body. Kate puts the holy water back, terrified by Ellie's reaction.


Kate and Jane say a prayer in Greek, and the little girl falls limp. Ellie looks tired. Her eyes are still open, but very weary. Kate brings her into her lap, and the child points at her glowing nightlight. She yells, ""It's by the light, it's by the light, go away!"" Both Jane and Kate hold their fear inside, trying desperately to tell the girl she's dreaming and to calm down. Ellie eventually stops yelling about the light only to pass out into a deep sleep.


**10:10pm.** - Jane stops recording on her phone. She's excited she got all of it on camera. Both her and her sister check on Sarah, who has been asleep through the entire fiasco. 


**10:15pm.** - Jane and Kate are walking downstairs when they hear a loud BANG. They rush towards the door to the garage, and hear what sounds like somebody throwing a fit on the other side. They can hear the crashing of boxes, clanging of objects, and the dragging scraping sound they heard outside. Neither are brazen enough to open the door. They call the parents to see when they will be home. 


**10:20pm.** - Clutching knives, phones, and hiding in the living room the two girls are on the phone with their mother. They tell her everything that's been happening and are scaring the wits out of her. The mother tells them to peek out the door into the garage...


**10:30pm.** - After much debating and after the banging noises have stopped, the girls stand before the door. Slowly, and terrifyingly, they crack the door open. Inside, it's a mess... and most interestingly, the garage door is closed. Even more... the deadbolt inside, that locks it from the outdoors, is still locked tight. The only way to have gotten in then was through the house, and they had locked the door to the garage. The door to the garage is in the living room where they sat listening to the raging that went on on the other side. Nobody came in or out.


**10:35pm.** - They pick up the garage. Putting things back on shelves, organizing the tipped over boxes. Jane and Kate are visibly shaken and exhausted. 


**11:00pm.** - The parents come home. The first thing they ask is why are all the lights on outdoors. Obviously both Kate and Jane want to know if they have any motion detection systems around the house? The parents laugh, they're not *that* rich. Dad goes upstairs to check on the girls and tuck them in again. Kate asks the mom if they have a piano, and they do... in basement storage. Jane pulls out her phone, and tries to show the video she took of the daughter having some sort of attack. Strangely, when she opens the file, it says it is corrupted and closes every time she tries to load it. Nothing is recorded, and nothing is believed by the parents. 




* Since then, the two little girls have aged. They've never moved from the home. Ellie, the youngest, has been diagnosed with anxiety problems and depression and she's only 5. The parents say she refuses and throws huge temper tantrums when they try to take her to the basement playroom. Sarah, the elder sister, has become very withdrawn and quiet. She doesn't remember hearing her sister's fit that night, even though their bedrooms are right across from each other and the doors were half-open. The parents are visibly shaken, but refuse to discuss any events with Kate or Jane.

(x-post from r/nosleep)",bpmartin,57,9,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/r7i6r/the_ordinary_house_that_experienced_a_very/,"The below story was told to me by my brother and I believe it to be 100% true. Before starting this story I would like to start off by saying that before my brother told me this he has never mentioned to me that he believed in the paranormal or had any type of paranormal experience.

A few months ago my brother called me very early in the morning which was strange as he normally waits till later in the day to call me (we are separated by two time zones). He started off the conversation by saying, ""You are going to think I'm crazy but I swear this happened."" I asked him to gone on thinking it might have been some funny/wild story. The story did indeed turn out to be wild....My brother is married with a 5 year old daughter. One night he was doing some online research in the master bedroom while his wife was doing some last minute cleanup around the house. His wife walked into the bedroom to let him know that she was going to tuck their daughter into bed and lay down with her for a few minutes until she fell asleep. About 30 minutes later he heard extremely loud screaming and footsteps running through the house. He ran into the kitchen to find his wife and child hysterical in fear. ""What is going on?!?!?"" After a couple of minutes of his wife trying to catch her breath she finally said, ""Her piano is playing itself."" ""Her"" was referring to my brother's daughter who has a child's piano in her bedroom. The piano is not an electronic piano or a toy. It is a real miniature piano. ""What do you mean it is playing itself?"", my brother asked. ""I laid down with her so she would go to sleep quickly. We both ended up falling asleep. I faintly started to hear her piano make some noise. At first I thought maybe I was dreaming so I went back to sleep. A few minutes later I heard it again and in a half sleep daze I said, 'Sweetie please stop playing your piano and get back in bed.'"", my brother's wife explained. My brother's daughter instead rolled over in bed and said, ""Thats not me playing the piano, mommy."" That response certainly jolted my brother's wife wide awake. She grabbed their daughter and they both ran out the room. After hearing this my brother's first response was obvious, ""It's probably just an insect/pest/mouse running across the keys."" He decided to go check it out for himself. He started walking down the hall to the bedroom. About 15 feet from the door, he heard it. The piano was indeed playing itself. I asked him if it was just making noise or legitimately playing a song. He claims that it didn't necessarily sound like a song but definitely something intelligent pressing keys. Much like a child trying to play a piano. He obviously got extreme chills at the sound of the piano playing. He ran back to his bedroom and got a gun. On his way back to his daughter's bedroom he started hearing it again. He turned the hall light on. The piano continued. He crept right in front of the door. The piano continued. He slowly opened the door. The piano continued. The light from the hall lamp shown into the room enough that it reached the piano. He could literally see the keys being manipulated. The piano continued. He turned the bedroom light on. The piano halted.

Wow, I did not know what to say. You hear stories like this but that is all they are, just stories. When your own brother tells you a story like this....it becomes a lot more. My first response was...well maybe it was something inside the piano. Like a mouse running back and forth on the keys from the inside. My brother thought the same thing. As soon as the piano stopped playing he started investigating it. Trying to find some source. He tried to open the piano to see if there was something inside it. But the paino was actually screwed shut. He went and grabbed a screwdriver and unassembled the lid on the piano. Upon opening the piano he found that the strings of the piano were actually attached to the lid itself. So the keys must strike upward instead of downward...which makes it a lot harder for a pest to sneak inside a sealed piano and put enough force on the keys for them to strike upward. Being from the South as my family is, it is likely you will know someone who may have knowledge of spiritual events. My brother called my Aunt not really knowing what to do. Never in his life had anything like that ever happened. The house he is living in used to be my parents house a few years before. We grew up in that house. Nothing like this had ever happened. My brother felt very vulnerable that night which was strange for him being that his career is in the military and had already been deployed twice to fight in the war.

My Aunt asked him if there was anything new in the house. My brother's first response was no. After a few hours he remembered that a few days before my grandmother had gifted his daughter an old porcelin doll that she picked up at garage sale. My Aunt said to get rid of the doll. He responded by saying that he was going to burn it right when he got home. She recommended burying it. As soon as he got home, he took the doll went into the woods behind the house and buried it.

Nothing has happened since. So weird to think that an ordinary house, with an ordinary family, on an ordinary night suddenly became very, very unordinary.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_r7i6r,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/r7i6r/the_ordinary_house_that_experienced_a_very/,

He died before I was born and no one talked about him much when I was little. When I was a teen, I heard more about him but it was basically just talking about what a mean old bastard he was. 

Then, when I was about 14 or 15, my dad informs me that I have 2 aunts and an uncle living in Kentucky. As I later found out (when I was college), my grandmother married my grandfather and he was actually still married to his (first?) wife in Kentucky whom he had 3 children with. Anyway, over Christmas, my parents came to visit me and Dad told me this weird story about him. 

He had 3 children, we'll call them Karen (the oldest girl), Sharon, and Bill (the youngest) and he was very mean and cruel to them and their mother. But one day, he just disappeared. A few weeks later, a man was found dead in a nearby river. He was identified as Edward (my grandfather). 

There was a funeral, the family mourned. 3 months after disappearing, he came strolling back into town like nothing ever happened and with no explanation. But he was even meaner than he had ever been before. He would constantly berate the children for every apparent wrong they committed. One day, he and the 3 children were riding their bikes into town to do laundry or some such thing and Karen was lagging behind. He rode ahead and was cussing at them. She thought to herself, ""I wish he was dead."" 

Suddenly, Edward stopped his bike, stood up and turned around. And he said to Karen, ""Don't you worry, I'm not going anywhere.""

I'm going to try and keep this as short and easy to read as possible.

   My grandparents used to live in this big creepy farm type house in Bryant, Indiana. Anyone who may be familiar with Bryant knows that it isn't much of a town, it's mostly farm land and a small gas station. The house is two stories and is basically 2 large apartments but they lived in it as a house because they had 13 kids. When pulling in to the driveway you can see a huge garage and a bomb/storm shelter. Walking in the back door there's the laundry room, then kitchen, then living room and off to the back is the bathroom and my grandparents seperate bedrooms. The stairs to the second floor are through the kitchen and once upstairs there is a bathroom on your immediate left a bedroom straight ahead 2 more bedrooms off to the right of the first bedroom and a livingroom/ kitchen to the farthest right. 
         
  The upstairs seemed to have the most ""activity"" and the first of q few stories I've heard from family creeps me out the most. My aunt Jenny was a teen at the time (so this is like the mid 1960's) and shared the middle upstairs bedroom with 2 sisters. She was lying in bed one night, her sisters were already asleep and she heard her door creep open. She said she felt like someone was staring at her for a while and she finally rolled over and looked at the door but saw nothing. She rolled back over and after a few minutes a womans voice that she didn't recognise said ""Jenny, are you dead yet?"" She said she just layed there as still as she could and finally drifted off to sleep. She didn't talk about it again until years later in college she based a fiction story on that night.
             
  Fast forward to the early 90's, I was probably around 10, my family drove to Indiana every Saturday and spent the day at our grandparents house. We were all outside, my mom was on the porchswing with my grandma, dad was watching my grandpa drive my little sister around on his riding mower, and my brother and myself were playing near the bomb shelter. I suddenly felt weird and looked up at the house, there was an old lady in a flowery hat standing in the upstairs livingroom window. I tried pointing her out to my brother but she was gone.
   
   A few years before that (late 80's) my uncle Tim was still living at home. He had basically taken over the upstairs and stayed to himself a lot but I LOVED him and so any time we were there I wanted to hang out with him. I pestered my mom for a while to get Tim and she finally said ""go up and get him"" I went upstairs and heard a growling sound from the bathroom so I ran back down. My mom said ""It's probably Tim trying to scare you, go back up and scare him instead"" 
     
 My plan was to sneak back up and hide in the livingroom and jump out at him when he came out of the bathroom. I got upstairs and the ""growling"" was still happening so I sneaked to the livingroom and there's Tim sitting on the couch watching TV. I started crying and made Tim go check the bathroom but there was no more growling and the bathroom was empty.
       
  I wish I could go back there now that I'm not so nervous about spooky things but the house was auctioned off to help pay for my grandpa's funeral in the year 2000. My grandma lives in a very un-haunted apartment now.  I hope you guys enjoyed my story. I have some more creepy stories I'll try to post another day. And if I can find one I'll add a pic of my grandparents house here soon.

We're on the second floor of the building, with only one floor above us. Here's a [pic](http://i.imgur.com/H4e8N.jpg): we're the window second from top. We rarely see our neighbours - most are Bangladeshi and keep themselves to themselves - but we *do* occasionally hear them, specifically, the people in the flat upstairs.

Mostly we just hear them stomping around, but occasionally we've heard them having sex or just quietly talking. We've really thought nothing of it, they're just your average reclusive neighbours.

Until last week, when our landlord came round for a visit. He talked about the renovations he was planning on the building, specifically on the two flats above us. We asked how the people upstairs would take it, the noise and such... and then he told us the flats upstairs were empty, and have been for two years.

So that's that, basically. My girlfriend and I seem to have phantom neighbours. I can feasibly see how the talking and sexytime noises could be from a flat *to the side* of us, as opposed to above us, but the stomping is a different issue. *It's definitely coming from above*, from an *empty* flat. It's a rather creepy situation to be in, to say the least.

Here's another [pic](http://i.imgur.com/i1lHu.jpg), of the flat's door and its stairwell.

Now, off the beaten track of this forest there is this random ass gravestone with a skull and cross bones and latin all round the edges. We often went walks to it, so intrigued by how random it was. One day we decided to give it a bit of a proddin and a pokin, so we got a shovel and tried to move it around etc (to no avail). We even tried to just speak to it. No response.
We walked on down the trail, silently, after the weird eery intensity of speaking to a long dead corpse. I walked slightly ahead and Lora and Chris followed behind. After a good 10 seconds of no one speaking, I picked up on Lora just humming and singing under her breath. Quiet and hushed, but still imposing. It was pretty beautiful. That continued for about another couple of seconds before she burst out laughing along with Chris.

*Enter batshit crazy part*

After the laughing subsided, Chris said to me ""ha ha Ian, you sing like a girl"".
We argued for about 10 minutes, both claiming the other party was trying to wind the other up, and realised what the fuck had just happened. Clear as day, a voice clearly a couple of feet in front of them, and behind me, was singing. Lora cried and we were on the fucking verge of it too.

However, I absolutely believe him as even today, 30 years later, he cannot talk about it without getting visibly shaken and waves of goosebumps going over him. 

My brother was staying at a friends house. This is in the city, however, my friends property was large enough, it actually had two homes on it. The one they lived in, and another that had been abandoned for unknown reasons. 

My brothers friend had set up a fort of sorts in the abandoned house and loved playing in it. My brother wasn't too sure about it and never felt safe going in there for fear of getting in trouble. 

On this particular day, my brother couldn't find his friend and went to the house with the fort inside, figuring he was there. He went upstairs to find him *that is where the fort was*. While up there an old left behind corded phone began to ring. My brother absentmindedly answered it......... Mind you this is in an abandoned house.

On the other line he heard what he thought was his friend laughing and saying ""Why don't you come down stairs?"". So, my brother angrily hung up the phone, went down stairs and looked around. Another phone down there began to ring. Again, he answered it, however as he heard historical laughter on the phone, he realized it was completely unplugged. 

He threw the phone down, ran outside and stood there staring at the house, white faced. His friend came out from behind the house he lived in and saw my brother. Asked him what was wrong and my brother told him what happened. His friend said ""Thats impossible, there are no phones in that house and all of the cables to it have been cut off."" Saying this as he pointed to the disconnected bundle where power, phone and cable would have run into the house.

My brother never set foot in that house again, and scaresly went back to visit his friend.

He said he would be down to go to the cemetery with me in a few weeks. It's about 45 min to an hour from where we live now but that's not much longer than my work commute so I'm used to the drive. I have another friend that would probably be interested in going. I know its not the same as being able to go to the house but I don't think that will be an option without first talking to my friend's mom which I'm not sure I'm ready to do. Not to mention, after finding out that Jeff is alive I'm beginning to wonder if the activity stems from the old cemetery behind his house. I'm not sure of the laws surrounding visiting cemeteries at night but I'm willing to chance it. My last trespassing ticket wasn't *that* expensive. 


I actually ended up doing way more research on the history of the property than I had originally intended to so I hope someone reads this. I’m also completely open to debunking what we’ve experienced in the house. I’ll start with the history of the house, the weird stuff we found and our glitch in the matrix and then I’ll give you guys the juicy really unexplainable events.

I’ve always felt uncomfortable in that house. Particularly getting out of my car (that I had to park within sight of the cemetery) and walking to his house. It was a feeling I became familiar with at that house. The feeling like I needed to bolt. Something in my head always just said RUN but I always felt like the second I ran something would get me. I always felt like there was something nasty out there and I was always prepared to look up and see some creepy skeletor booking for me. I never felt particularly comfortable in the house but I felt downright unsafe when I was outside. There was something about his back yard and the woods behind his house that separated his yard from a really old cemetery (oldest grave I found went back to 1754 and the most recent were 1950’s save for a couple from mid 2000’s). Maybe this was all just me freaking myself out.

It all started back in high school when another friend (we'll call him B-Co because that's what we called him) and I helped my friend Mark and his mom move into their new house. He moved into this house in September 2006. The house was built in 1928 and after searching some public records I was able to find out that the house only had one previous *recorded* owner. The previous owner was a man born in 1938 who is now living somewhere in Florida. There is no purchase date on the house for the previous owner recorded online so my best guess is his family probably built the house and left it to him because other records seem to indicate he lived there from 1987 to 2007 (not sure why it says that when my friend moved there in 2006)

Our First Strange Experience: It was the first night we were there moving their stuff in. Mark and I had gone across the street to the river to sit on the rocks and have a smoke. Once we were good and stoned we made our way back to the house where B-Co and Mark’s mom were supposed to be moving stuff in. When we got back to the house the cars were still in the driveway but all the lights were off. We couldn’t find them anywhere. I’m telling you we searched the house top to bottom and even walked around outside looking for them. I can’t remember what we did after that but we left the house (but not the property) briefly and came back to find them in the kitchen putting stuff away. We asked them where they were and we made a joke that they were probably “doin it”. They said they’d been in the kitchen since we left. Strange because the kitchen is the first room you’re in when you enter the house from the back door (which was the only door they ever really used).

My friend Mark’s bedroom was a room at the back of the attic that was unfinished when they moved in. Before they carpeted and painted the attic the floor was just plywood with a big stain that looked like a blood stain. We made more jokes about this because even though it looked like old dried blood, what do we know? It could have been anything. We brushed it off again until Mark was ripping down the insulation in the attic (it was just sawdust and cotton or something like that) so they could re-insulate and put up sheetrock. Behind the insulation was a wire with two handles like you would use to cut clay that also looked like it had blood on it. Now this was also explainable because clay is rusty colored but there was what appeared to be rust and something of a similar color but darker and not powdery like the rust/clay was. On part of the frame near where the wire was found was a handwritten memo “Don’t forget to feed Jeff”. We were pretty creeped out but kind of brushed it off again thinking “Damn the people who used to live here were weird.” It wasn’t long before Mark found a rock in the back yard. I wasn’t there for this but there was something about the rock that made him and another friend of ours start digging underneath it. I can’t remember if it had something carved into it or written on it but it was something to indicate it was a memorial of some sort. Realistically we figured it was someone’s pet buried back there but we joked that Jeff was buried in the back yard. 
By the time they start digging in the back yard it’s been a while since they moved in. Probably spring 2007. Not long after they started digging in the back yard (like a day or two later) is when weird things started happening. The first thing to happen was when Mark came home from school one day. In the basement they have this little pantry with an old wooden door with a latch (typical on old thin doors and gates). The pantry latch was securely closed but when he went into the pantry for a snack everything, and I mean EV.REH.THENG. was in a neat pyramid type pile in the middle of the floor. It couldn’t have been his mom because she left before him in the morning and came home rather late in the evenings after he’d been home. She also worked pretty far away so it wasn’t really feasible for her to come home during the day, on top of the fact that she reassured us she hadn’t.

The next thing that happened was really the first thing to truly unsettle me. We were at school when Mark gets a call from his mom asking if he’s home. Apparently while he was at school and his mom at work, someone had called 911 from their house and it apparently sounded like someone was holding the phone (rustles, clicking, creaking of the phone, tapping of the cord type of sounds). We would often hang out after school and this was one of those days. When we got back to his house his mom still wasn’t due home for a couple of hours. We looked and the only phone in the entire house is a corded phone attached to the wall in the kitchen at about eye level and it was on the hook, seemingly undisturbed. Weird, maybe it was some kind of hiccup. I don’t really know how phones work. Can a phone dial 911 without being off the hook? After this they filled in the hole and wouldn’t let anyone go near it.

Time passes, we graduate high school with nothing other than weird noises and moving door handles, scratching sounds that we always attributed to drafts, an old house. Nothing that couldn’t be rationalized one way or another. Though we always found an explanation for the weird sound, or what something moved, I always felt vulnerable in that house. I always felt the urge to bolt every time I was on the stairs. I could never get to the top of them fast enough and I HATED going to the bathroom alone. I always felt like someone was going to grab my ankles or push me down the stairs. Aside from the attic the other place I felt uncomfortable was the hallway where the downstairs bedrooms were. When you exit the attic stairs you’re in the dining room. Immediately to your right is a set of glass double doors with crystal door knobs that open up to a small hallway with the bathroom straight ahead, his mom’s room to your left and the unused bedroom to your right. Whenever I went to the bathroom I always felt like someone was standing in front of the unused bedroom door. The best I can describe it is like the feeling you get when you turn a corner and someone is right there but no one ever was and I never saw anything, I just got that feeling in my gut like when you turn a corner not expecting someone to be there. Same when I was leaving the bathroom, it felt like there was someone always waiting outside to use the bathroom.

Then I finally had my own “can’t just brush this off moment”. It was my first semester of college if I’m not mistaken. We were hanging out in the attic as per usual when Mark goes downstairs to get a snack or something. I was sitting in a recliner facing the center of the room where there is a mostly full black garbage bag. The garbage bag was dead center in the middle of my field of vision. All of a sudden a crumpled up paper towel lobs halfway across the room INTO THE GARBAGE BAG. I’m telling you, I watched it with my full attention go up, peak, and then descend into the garbage bag. My jaw just dropped and then I went into a cold sweat, my heart has never beat so fast. I couldn’t get up I felt completely paralyzed with fear. All I could do was pull my knees to my chest and close my eyes tight and plug my ears until Mark came back upstairs. I didn’t want to see what threw that paper towel, didn’t want to hear it and definitely didn’t want it to touch me. There were no windows open, and it was crumpled in a ball so it’s not like it floated in the wind or anything. 5 years later I still have no way to explain how this could have happened.

One night we were hanging out in the back yard near the trees that border the cemetery when we started taking pictures of each other goofing off. We actually ended up getting quite a few orb photos and started hearing something crunching through the woods slowly. This could have been an animal but sounded more like a slow walk Though orb photos don’t usually do much for me I figured I’d include them. I keep them with the mindset that they neither confirm, nor debunk anything on their own but may be worth keeping around. Orb pictures seem to be pretty explainable as dust and such but I’ve never gotten any orb photos aside from these and I’ve never had anyone look at them so I figured I’d include them and maybe you guys can explain them away. (Or confirm. ‘gulp’).

Eventually Mark moved into the room in the basement because it was cheaper to heat and it felt even creepier. He ended up moving out less than a year after moving into the basement though his mom still lives there. I haven’t heard from him in a year to a year and a half and I’m not really sure why. He just stopped returning my calls and answering my messages and is never online anymore. I don’t know if there’s any correlation between the happenings at the house but I may never know. I don’t know where he moved to. My best friend for almost ten years and he just dropped off the face of the planet.

I have screen shots of the public records and some of the stuff I looked up on the previous owners of the home that I can provide upon request but all I can really gather is that the original owner did indeed have a son named Jeffrey who is/would be 48. From what I can tell he seems to be alive and well living in Massachusetts. So maybe it wasn’t Jeff haunting us but that’s what we always called him.

I'm sorry they aren't imgur links. My boyfriend's computer is ancient and for some reason I can't upload to imgur or tinypic so I quickly made a photobucket account and put together an album including a picture of the front of the house, google maps, and the orb pictures. If this causes a problem with viewing the pictures I'll upload them to imgur as soon as I can.

1357638715.0,43,self.Thetruthishere,166dbp,[ME] The Scariest Thing I've Ever Experienced,TheFarsider,67,24,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/166dbp/me_the_scariest_thing_ive_ever_experienced/,"Ok here is my true story from a few years back. Although it is long and I am a shitty writer, I put it in a narrative form.

Several years ago when I was a kid, I invited my friends Matt and Aaron over for a sleep over. We started with the usual video games and pizza until it got dark enough to play our favourite game; balltag.

 The gist of the game is pretty simple, hide-and-go-seek tag where you have to be hit by the ball to be tagged. We were young, it was very late, and the cat-and-mouse nature of the game put us all in a very surreal mood. Like we were the characters in a movie. I will not bore you with the otherwise normal events of the game but eventually Matt and I were hiding in the large undergrowth beneath my deck which dominates my backyard. In some places the undergrowth is so thick it was hard to even walk through it. In other parts it is only covered by tall grass making it possible to see nearly the entire length of it. Matt and I were quietly trading each other's war stories of the game so far when suddenly the deck above our heads began to creak and moan. Immediately we became silent. Surprised at how fast Aaron must of gotten there. Then we heard footsteps directly above our heads on the deck. It sounded as if the person was walking in a small circle right above us. Like a vulture circling over its prey. As quickly as it started it abruptly stopped. What was odd was that the footsteps both started and stopped too far away from the lawn for the person to have gotten to that spot without making more footsteps to get there. I began whispering this observation to Matt before being interrupted by Aaron most unassumingly yelling out his frustration of being unable to find us. The quick switch from frightening and paranormal to normal would have almost of been funny if Aaron's yells hadn't  come from the front yard because it meant that he could not have been the one making the footsteps on the deck in the backyard.

We wanted to alert Aaron but were too scared of letting our presence being known to do anything about it. Eventually Aaron wandered into the backyard. He scanned the area for obvious indications of our hiding place. The fact that he did not see anything worth screaming about Matt and I got the confidence to walk out of the bushes (and subsequently me getting a ball thrown at my face) to tell Aaron about what had transpired. Frightened, he stated that he too had experienced something similar. Apparently a little earlier he was hiding underneath the deck in a more visible part of the undergrowth. On the other side of the visible area, he saw a dark figure silently walk down into the area, crouch down, and flash what he thought was a cellphone in the direction of Aaron. Thinking it was whomever else was hiding, Aaron reciprocated the action before he heard me exclaim that I had gotten Matt and that he was now it somewhere else in the yard. Stunned, he turned back to where the figure was hiding but if anyone was there he could no longer make them out.

It escapes me now but for whatever reason we went back to playing balltag. Unfortunately for me, Aaron had hit me with the ball last and I was now it. Young and virtually all alone I wandered around the yard desperately looking for one of my friends so that I could tag him and pair up with the other hider. Eventually I found Aaron in the front yard. Aaron bolted out of his hiding spot and I took aim and threw the ball at him. I missed! As fast as I could I picked up the ball and chased after Aaron. He was already a good distance away from me but I saw him crash into the bushes and down the hill into the undergrowth. I sprinted after him and before I knew it I was surrounded by leaves and vines and small trees. I scanned for any signs of Aaron. At the very bottom of the decline I could see small, leafy bushes swaying ever so slowly. I squinted at them until I began to ever so faintly see what looked like a body hiding in the fetal position. Not totally sure if it really was a person or not I took my chances and fired the ball at it. The ball hit the target and I heard a faint ""unf"" and saw what looked like an arm reactively swing around. I pivoted and triumphantly exclaimed that Aaron was now it. That was when Aaron came out of a wall of leaves directly on my right and said ""What are you talking about? You didn't even throw the ball in my direction."" Hyped up on too much adrenaline to make a connection I merely said, ""Oh well then I got Matt, you're it Matt."" and kept walking up the hill. At the top I looked down and waited for a response. ""Hey! Matt! I got you, you're it now!"" Still no response. Angry I kept walking away. Aaron stayed where he was. ""Hey, are you sure you got someone? No one is making a sound..."" ""Yes I'm sure I got someone, I saw an arm or something when I got them. If it wasn't you then it had to of been Matt he's just being dumb. He was hiding in that area of bushes below the walnut tree go get him."" That was when I turned the corner of my house and saw Matt hiding belly down on my trampoline. His eyes were wide for he heard the conversation and knew what it meant. I froze and stared into his eyes. Fear fell over me like a wave as what was happening slowly dawned on me.

""AARON GET OUT OUT OF THERE I JUST FOUND MATT UP HERE!! THAT'S NOT MATT!!'

Without saying a word Aaron ran up the hill, Matt scrambled out of the trampoline and I recited what had happened exactly. Suddenly a wretched and loud wailing sound erupted from every direction. In an instant we were at the door to my house but to our disbelief it was locked. I screamed to run for the side entrance. We were literally pushing and shoving each other out of the way to get there, me only barely aware that the noise was caused by the blocked sprinklers turning on  for it no longer mattered, we were in full panic mode. We practically broke down the door getting inside. We each grabbed knives from the kitchen and locked every point of entry possible. After a little while we began talking about what had happened. I explained the cause of the noise and that although I was rather sure I saw an arm fly out of the bushes when I threw the ball, I could of been mistaken. Actually I was beginning to wonder if it was all an elaborate prank and that they had invited a fourth person to come and freak me out during balltag as Aaron did things like this constantly. However my suspicions were quickly swept away when I saw the state Aaron and Matt were in. Aaron said we should run to his house which was only a few houses down but quickly discarded it because it meant going outside. Matt asked several times for me to wake my parents up but I declined because my thought process was more or less I was a big boy now and could take care of my own problems and didn't want to look like a dumb kid to my parents. They were both super paranoid and I knew that neither of them knew what was going on.

1341846410.0,42,self.Thetruthishere,w9tqh,[ME] Haunted apartment. ,conme,48,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/w9tqh/me_haunted_apartment/,"[Layout of the apartment for the curious. Not to scale.](http://i.imgur.com/AiZUK.png)

I moved into an apartment with my boyfriend last August. Getting it so early was a bit of a surprise, since we weren't expecting it until early September. We found out through the rumor mill that it had opened up because the previous tenant died while living there. 

The encounters started innocuously enough. I felt something creeping up my leg while I was sitting on the floor in the living room, about two weeks into living there. I swatted at it - thinking it was a spider - but it kept creeping up my thigh, almost under my dress. I had to leap up and leave the room for it to stop. This is the only time either of us has been ""touched.""

Then there was the laundry room. The laundry room, for visual's sake, has a washer/dryer hookup, some shelves and is the only room in the apartment that has a free hanging light with a string with which to turn it on.

Neither my boyfriend or I go in there too often, because we do not have our own machines. It's mainly used for storage of small trinkets and moving boxes. For a few months in the winter, it began to open of its own accord. Sometimes when we went to open it, it wouldn't budge. It was less creepy at this point and more bizarre. 

Really, until the faucets incident, I wasn't too concerned about having some odd energy floating around the house.

The ""faucets"" incident is the second most recent encounter we've had. My boyfriend wakes up at 3am to go to work at 4am, so until 11am - 12pm, I'm usually alone in the house. I was wandering around, cleaning, picking up clothes, etc. I got into the master bedroom and was opening the window when I heard the distinct sound of running water. I thought maybe it was coming from outside - someone washing their car - but noticed the lower parking lot was empty.

I walked back out into the hallway and peered into the bathroom to find that the sink was running water. I had not been in the bathroom since around 8 or 9 that morning and it was now nearing 11. I had also been walking through the apartment since I'd been up, so I thought it was rather unlikely that I would have left the sink on that whole time. But since it was the first - and at the time only - occurrence, I shrugged it off.

Then it happened again! And again! *And again!* Once more it happened with the sink in the bathroom, and then it happened twice in the sink in the kitchen.

The most recent encounters we've had have been the opening of cabinets in the kitchen. It was just one cabinet in the beginning, but now quite a few of them have been opened. Usually it's when we've been watching movies or reading books and have not been in the kitchen. Sometimes I'll glance into the kitchen from the living room to see no open cabinets, and then look up a moment later to see one wide open.

I'm so used to these happenings by now that the cabinets are just another weird thing to me, but my boyfriend is a bit spooked by it, since the cabinets is the first of the encounters that he's seen firsthand. 

I don't really know what to think of these things. I'm a rational person (everyone says that, don't they?) and accept that knowing that a man *died* in the place where I live has made me hyper-aware of quote-unquote encounters. If anyone has thoughts, advice or a rational explanation to these things, I'd be happy to hear any. 

ASIDE: I guess it's also something to note that the opening of cabinets has occurred in the past few days and has been persisting for a week. I thought that maybe the recent influx of activity was because this would be about the time that the man was to die. But I don't know.

EXTRA ASIDE: I've been thinking about running my webcam all day in the area of the living room that looks into the kitchen and down the hallway, just to see what might come of it. Bad idea? Good idea? I know horror movies always seem to start that way... :P

*EDIT1: While we were in the house, a cabinet opened by itself (again) the laundry room door opened again. We closed it and then attempted to see how hard it was to open. Basically, it can't be opened without turning the knob.... If you guys want videographic proof of me trying to open the door without turning the knob, I can do that, but I don't know if that would be very interesting.

The boyfriend and I are going out for the night and won't be back until late, so I'll be setting up the webcam then! I'll be positioning it to look at the cabinets that have been opening in the past two days. I hope something happens tonight so I can show you all. Who knows.

*EDIT2: Hey guys. I left the webcam running, but there's nothing to report from last night or today. I'm going to try again this whole week, so don't think I'm giving up!! ",,False,,t5_2sntx,1341968826.0,,,True,t3_w9tqh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/w9tqh/me_haunted_apartment/,
1339887039.0,43,self.Thetruthishere,v5ml2,[me][fam][o] One of the reasons we moved out,roltrap,52,9,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/v5ml2/mefamo_one_of_the_reasons_we_moved_out/,"I'm not much of a story teller nor am I a firm believer in the paranormal but I feel that what my wife and I experienced in while living in Germany  is worth putting some time and effort in this.

Here is where it starts: I was working as an IT consultant in Belgium when I met my future wife 3 years ago over an online MMORPG called Runes Of Magic. To make a long story short: I left my job eventually to move to Germany to be with her. We rented an appartment in Kierspe (Nordrhein Westfalen, [this is where we lived. Left appartment on the top](http://i.imgur.com/g6U52.png) )

We where kind of poor since we lived of what they call 'Arge' money, money from the government to suvive. I tried to find work as a foreigner not speaking German but it didn't go well.

It started with smells of perfume. The kind you would expect an elderly woman to wear. We would smell it every day in all rooms of the appartment and none of us used that kind of perfume.

I thought it was coincidence and I thought none of it but my wife was very nervous. She didn't feel at ease there. She mentioned it every day that something was wrong but I always told her it was nothing and that she shouldn't be worried.

One night I was playing runes of magic while wife and both kids where asleep. All was quiet and I was relaxing and playing until suddenly something hard hit me on the head. It was a toy from one of these surprise eggs. I was the only one in the room. It hurt pretty bad and allthough I don't give a crap about these things I was pretty confused about it. I didn't mention it to my wife until the next occurence.

A few days later my wife got freaked out while cleaning because one of our daughters playing strollers (the ones with a doll in it) started moving by itself. I didn't think much of it but I did mention what happened before with me. Needless to say she was getting more and more nervous. I didn't doubt what she saw but I was still kind of sceptical. 

The next one was the one that got me doubting. She went to her parents place (Kölnerstrasse in Kierspe for those who care) so I dropped her off and went to do my thing. We would just meet again in the appartment. I got home and as I pulled out the keys to open the door I saw someone walking from my daughters room to the bathroom (shadow of a person walking, our door had a window in it almost as big as the door itself but you couldn't really see through it) so I thought she got home before me. 
I opened the door and guess what... nobody there.
that is when I got kind of freaked out. 
I called her at her parents place and told her and she also got freaked out but she came back that same day.

Now the freakiest part: kids where asleep. My pc was in one room, hers in the other one. Both where playing Runes Of Magic. I had my light on, she was playing with a candle next to her. I hear her calling my name, so I went there and asked 'what is it?' 
At the same time the light in my room goes out and she tells me she didn't call me. Then we both realised my light just went out.

The last straw was when my wife woke up with severe claw scratches on her leg (pictures on bottom of the post) that hurt like hell. She didn't notice until she woke up and she was sleeping next to me all night.
I don't have sharp nails and to be honest no human nails could have done that kind of precise damage. she still has scars of it today after all those years (pictures below, taken this morning, years after it happened)

I know I'm not much of a story teller but that is also not my goal. Just trying to tell what happened.
We decided to move out asap because we didn't feel at peace.

here are some pictures of the appartment just to give you an idea how it looked like and how we lived (we didn't have alot of money)

If you want more information please ask me. As I said I suck at story telling but this really happened and I do not know what to make of it.

I was about two, and had picked up talking quickly, and was a bright child, so I was able to communicate well for my age. I have no memory of this even though I have many memories from my preschool years.

One day when I was playing with my toys, and running around doing toddler things, I came up to my parents and asked, ""Do you remember when we got married?"" Being somewhat confused by the question they asked me some things to better understand what I meant. ""All our family was there, and everyone was so happy!"" I said. (My parents had an LDS Temple marriage, so there are some things that are not talked about openly outside of the Temple due to their sacred nature.) Then I proceeded to describe parts of the ceremony and even the clothing of some who were there. 

Not very scary, or unsettling, but I love this story. My favorite part is that somewhere in all this I said something like, ""...and my sisters were there and we were all happy!""

I'm shaking like crazy right now.
This isn't the first occurrence. A few weeks ago a light turned on in the middle of the night.

EDIT: Sorry for the lack of details last night, I was so spooked I posted this and went straight to a friends house. Firstly, I don't do drugs and hasn't been drinking. 

I live in an older style apartment on the bottom floor. I have timber flooring and everyone above has carpet over cement. I also have two cats so if I ever hear footsteps I blame it on one of those two things. 

I recently got out of a LDR, he moved out and I stayed. About two weeks after he moved out I started to experience a few strange things, like wall lights turning on in the middle of the night, my computer turning on by itself (though this could be a glitch and explained away), I heard my fridge open and close a week ago (but again there could be an explanation there) and more importantly, for about three nights in a row as soon as I put my head on my pillow to go to bed the pillow would gently move behind my head (I have experienced sleep paralysis so I know I wasn't asleep). The thing is that none of these occurrences spooked me like what happened last night. 

I was talking it over with my friend, it was my mothers birthday on Saturday (she passed away a few years ago) my friend suggested that because I was upset on Saturday I might have sent a signal out that might have generated enough energy to get a signal back on Sunday. In no way did I consciously want to be contacted by my mum, and if it is her,  does not asking her to leave mean that I'm keeping her from moving on in the afterlife?

Part 3 - http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1b9skk/me_fr_haunted_asked_for_it_one_week_of_terrifying/

This happened to me in the beginning of the school year during a break we had sometime early in the year (I remember this because a couple of my old high school friends were back from a college an hour away.) I am a college freshman living in North Dakota, where I've lived my whole life.

I can promise you that no matter how far-fetched the upcoming tale may sound, that it all happened to me, and I can verify places, witnesses, or anything you need me to in the comments if you'd like. Please excuse my writing if it isn't up to par. This is my first post, and I've only been on TTIH for a few days.
This all started when I was with 4 friends in my car. In North Dakota, there isn't much to do on any given night, especially late at night, on a weekday, when you're 18. So, we went to a friend's house, but quickly got bored, then went for the drive where our story begins. We were driving down a well-traveled road that I had never been to the end of before. It ended up turning into rural dirt roads past fields after a roundabout a few miles on. I forget the conversation, but I remember, it was just then that I said, ""Man, I wish something scary or unexplainable would happen to me."" My friend Connor said, from the passenger seat, ""Be careful what you wish for, man."" I know, I know, sounds like the perfect set-up to any fabricated scary story, but I really didn't think anything of it at the time. We drove around in this rural maze of dirt roads for another hour or two until we found our way out and went home. Nothing noteworthy.

The next night, my friends and I were bored again. It was about 2 am. Off of 52nd (the street we were on the previous night) there is an old house that had half of a bus with the end blown off, a garage that smelled of candy strawberry (I've been told because they made ""strawberry meth"" there) and a run down house that was vandalized by local kids. It's all abandoned, all creepy, and the bus was blown up from a meth lab exploding. Apparently some people died there when it happened. We weren't there because it's a good place to frighten our friends who had never been there before. Myself and 4 friends drove past a wal-mart that is directly by, and as we drive by, my friend Rhett (who is EXTREMELY superstitious) says he saw a black cat cross the cars path and we should turn back. We question his sexuality and press on to the house. At the house, we get out to relieve ourselves. Connor and I go North of the car closer to the house, and Rhett and Sam go south of the car closer to the forest. Collin waits to the east of the car. Connor and I finish peeing, then on the other side of a rubble pile in the middle of this clearing, we hear what sounded like someone rolling over in the dry grass. We look at each other, and we run back to the car. At that exact moment, Rhett and Sam are wide-eyed, and they said they heard ""two distinct, heavy footsteps. One right after the other. As though someone was walking, heard how loud their first footstep was, but had to put the second foot down after committing to making the step."" Connor and I tell them what we heard. Everyone hustles back into my car except for Connor and me. We decide to throw rocks at the other side of the rubble pile to prove it to be an animal. We both count to three and throw a handful of pebbles from the ground at where we heard the noise. The pebbles skitter across the clearing, and nothing.. There was a 2-second pause, then we heard what sounded like someone slowly rolling over, and then beginning to stand up. That was enough for us. We were out of there. I made a tight circle and exited the parking lot going 10 miles per hour. I decided that when my lights came over the rubble pile, I would slow down and let them illuminate the area for a couple seconds and try to see SOMETHING over there. What I saw boggles my mind to this day. About 20 feet away on the other side of the pile of dirt and roofing and tall grass, I saw, between the tall shrub-like grass, what would best be described as a head with an all white, featureless face mask on, tentatively raise its head to peer over the debri, then realize that my lights aren't going to be leaving its area as quickly as it thought, then duck back down quickly. When I say a ""face mask"" I don't mean Jason from Friday the 13th. I mean, it looked like a human shaped head, except it was hairless, it was not pale, but white like an egg, and it moved like you would expect a human, who didn't want to be seen, peering over a dirt pile, then getting caught in headlights, would move. It was eerie, and my friends of course weren't looking for it because I decided to slow down and look over literally last second, then book it out of there.

Anyway, I was shaken. I didn't know what I saw, nor did my friends have any guesses, and I don't really know if they believed me. We were driving past the wal-mart when something was in the road. I got closer in my car, and there was a black cat waiting in the middle of the road. Completely still except for its tail that was casually flicking back and forth. I slowly came to a stop. Told everyone what was in the road. Rhett was freaking out, and I swear the cat and I made eye contact for at least 10 seconds, then it casually padded away, and disappeared into a corn field in the direction of the house. We reversed back to the walmart parking lot so we could stay out of its path. Then we went to get gas and snacks at a nearby gas station. We went back to that place, taking the non-cat road, and brought with us bigger stones to throw. Nothing at all happened. So we went about our night and then went home with a creepy tale to tell.
This is the end of the first (and least creepy night of the 7 days that things were happening to me. Just because of how long this is taking to tell, I'm going to stop here unless people want me to keep going. Things such as abandoned churches, trailers hiding.. things, unexplained animal behavior occuring again and again and again and again, and the most ungodly sound I've ever heard occured later on. It only gets better from here if you want to hear more.)

http://goo.gl/maps/IenTX - I linked the abandoned house here. The picture must have been taken either before or after the buses and vehicles were there, but you can clearly see: the tree line Rhett and Sam peed at, the house, the rubble pile, the parking lot we pulled into, and the garage directly north of the parking lot.
If you zoom out more, and follow the road back past the walmart, you'll be able to see the road (parrallel to 52nd avenue) that we saw the cat on. Ask if anything in my story was too vague. I have more proof and will keep providing any for my next stories if people have any doubts or confusion. Thank you.

*EDIT* The road that we saw the black cat on is labeled as 55th Avenue south on google maps. We saw the cat right after passing the first right turn into the walmart parking lot, then that's where we reversed to and went around walmart the other way.
Also, if anyone really wants to go in-depth with fact-checking, we stopped at a Don's Car Wash, about half a mile east of walmart on 52nd avenue.

I am an extremely skeptical person, or was until I moved into this house my sophomore year. It's been almost two years and my lease is up soon thank god. I go to college in western kansas and the house I live in with 3 other people isn't particularly old or suspicious. It's just a shitty college house that we are being way overcharged for. The first few months I lived in it it was just me and my best friend for a whole summer alone and that was probably when I was the most terrified of the house just because it was so empty and lonely. Things started happening that were just weird enough to not be able to go unnoticed. We even got the house blessed by our Roman Catholic priest within the first month. So starting almost 2 years ago, I'm just going to list the things that have happened, some have happened multiple times so I will just list each thing once:

1. My friend and I were napping on the floor in the basement watching watership down when we both woke up at the exact same moment to the loud and distinct sound of toenails being clipped. for some reason it just scared the shit out of us so bad that we had to leave the house for several hours. It sounded so distinctly like toenails being clipped that weeks later I heard it again and freaked out so bad only to find that my roommate was actually clipping her toenails. We shrugged it off as the house ""settling"" or whatever but in the following 2 years we have never heard the noise again. 

2. I have an obsession with making sure every single cabinet in the kitchen is closed before I go to bed and several times I have woken up to every cabinet open and my roommates swear they didn't do it.

3. The kitchen/laundry room in the basement (where we heard the clipping sound from) is by far the creepiest area of the house. When my friend and I were the only ones living there we had a small table and two chairs down there that we never even touched because we tended to avoid the basement except for doing laundry. They were shoved into a corner of the room but one day my roommate came downstairs to find them in the middle of the room. We didn't have any pets at this time.

4. Once we did get a cat and a dog, they would occasionally freak out in the basement, jumping around, hissing/barking at things in the kitchen/hallway by the kitchen. 

5. The summer I lived with just one roommate we both had bedrooms in the basement but she refused to sleep down there because she was too freaked out by it so she slept on the couch most nights. One night I had almost fallen asleep when I heard by roommate walk downstairs and into her room and it sounded like she rummaged around for a while, got something and went back upstairs. The next morning I asked her why she came downstairs and she said she hadn't gone downstairs in days.

6. My roommate who was a little more superstitious than me said whenever I was gone overnight she would have a horrible time sleeping because she would hear heavy footsteps all night. 

7. This is the creepiest one because it happened once we had 6 people living in the house. Most of the previous ones occurred when there were only two of us so we tended to freak ourselves out about it and once more people moved in it really died down and we forgot about it. However, one night we were in the basement hanging out, I was sitting closest to the stairwell in a recliner and 2 of my roommates and one of their friends were sitting on the couch. At the same moment we all heard something and stared in utter terror at each other as if asking ""you heard that didn't you?""... without saying what it was the 3 guys went upstairs to investigate. I stayed downstairs and when they came back down to say nothing was on upstairs, not a computer, TV or anything, they asked me to describe what I heard. I said it sounded like a little girl singing but not with words, like ""la-la-la-la-la-la"" like a kids show or something. It still freaks me out so bad because that's exactly what my roommate that was sitting second closest to the stairwell told the other 2 guys he heard. The other 2 said they couldn't hear well enough, they just heard something. 

Everyone in the house besides the two of us that spent that first summer alone there was still somewhat skeptical but after that last encounter they started believing us. Since then similar things continue to happen but there are so many of us in the house I can usually shrug it off.

They mainly happened in my little sisters room (she was only around 3 at the time) but sometimes it would move around the top floor of the house. My mom would be cleaning my sisters room and would put her hand on a spot, and the spot would be warm, like someone was just sitting there. She brushed it off at first, as some effect of heating in the house, but it would occur in random spots. One time, my dad was taking a shower and the door was flung open and, in the middle of the summer, a frigid air rushed into the bathroom. The most noticeable thing was the smell of cigarette smoke in my sister's room. No one in my family smoked, which prompted my parents to ask neighbors about it. They told them that a man had lived there about 10 years before, who smoked, and he had died of a heart attack. After learning his name my mom would ask him if he could smoke near the window, after that the smoke smell was concentrated more near the window and not in the rest of the room. Just thought I'd share my experience with the supernatural and wonder else had any experiences with a friendly spirit.

Okay, some fellow redditors asked for an update, so here it is. Things have not gotten better, even after affirming my confidence and heeding advice from others. The knocking has gotten louder, and now happens nightly. Most nights, when I finally get to bed, I can actually hear footsteps from downstairs that lead all the way to my bedroom door. And most times when I hear this, my doorknob will turn and my door opens. Now, I did my investigating. I asked my entire household family if anyone checked on me and all that I got was weird looks and told that I had to be dreaming. So, no one actually remembers checking on me. Maybe someone was sleep-walking? I tend to be out late and maybe the sound of me coming home might disturb someone enough to cause that… And that thought satisfied me for a while. I got home really late, later than usual. I laid down, and soon enough I heard the footsteps. This time though, I turned over so that I could watch and catch whoever was doing this. My doorknob jiggled, and my door opened. No one was there. No one. Not a damn thing. Not going to lie, I cried that night. I started locking my door, but I still hear the footsteps and my doorknob still jiggles. 

I am freaked the hell out. Now I am seeing things everywhere, always a big black mass that darts around. It used to only happen once in a while, out of the corner of my eye, but now it’s almost all the time, right in front of me. My best friend has started to mention seeing things when she stays with me for long periods of time.

I am at a loss here. I don’t know what to do. I can’t really do anything until the end of next month when I leave for basic training. I hope that whatever is going on stays here and doesn’t follow me any further. 
If anyone has any (logical) advice, please comment or message. Even positive support would be nice. Everyone in my life just passes me off as crazy now, no one will take me seriously and I don’t know what else to do..

My dad for as long as I could remember always smoked and growing up around it got used to the smell of it. I don't smoke myself, but to this day I can only stand the smell of the brand my dad used to smoke.

In early 2009 he passed away rather suddenly. I was never able to tell him my formal goodbyes while he was still alive. Shortly after his passing I would start to smell a weird smell in my room that I could only attribute to being smoke. It didn't exactly smell like smoke but that was the closest thing I could attribute it to. It happened quite frequently at first but as time passed it happened less and less frequently to the point I can't remember the last time I have smelled it. I was the only person who ever smelled it even through other people were in my room when I could smell it. I never saw smoke or anything I could just smell it. I always found the smell to be sort of comforting, not like when you usually smell smoke you immediately start to worry and run around trying to make sure nothing is on fire.

After never really being able to find an explanation for it, I just figured it was my dads way of saying goodbye to me.

Throughout my life, my parents had told me that my Grandmother (my father's mother) had died due to diabetes complications.  As a younger child, I had believed this account.  However, I began to notice as I got older that my dad would quickly change the subject whenever my grandma's death was brought up.

When I was about 14 or 15 years old, my cousins (who were in their early 20's at the time) took my younger brother and me out to lunch at a Mexican restaurant.  We talked about random things, and eventually we got on the topic of ghosts and spirits.  My oldest cousin, let's call her Samantha, told us that she had experienced direct contact with our grandma (they also never got to meet her due to her untimely death).  

After she told my brother and I about her paranormal experience, she said, ""You do know how she died... right?""  My brother and I answered ""diabetes"" almost in perfect unison.  Samantha looked at us as if we were stupid, and said, ""No... she killed herself.  Shot herself in the head.""  My heart immediately sank because I had always known my parents had kept something about her death from me, but I had no idea they had flat out covered up my own grandmother's suicide.  

My brother asked Samantha why she did it, and Samantha simply looked at the ground.  My younger cousin, let's just call her Barb, simply said, ""Grandpa.""  My brother and I were astonished.  I asked them what my grandpa could have possibly done to drive his wife to suicide.  Barb said that it was because she had suspicions that my grandpa was cheating on her.  Samantha further explained that my aunt (her mother) had to clean her blood off of the walls. She also said that my father had always blamed himself because he had just gone off to college; he felt if he had still been home she would still be alive.  That was why he always changed the subject when we spoke of her.

That night, as I laid in bed, I started thinking about my grandma.  At that age, I still sort of prayed and talked to God and deceased relatives (I'm an atheist nowadays).  I started having a mental conversation with my grandmother and told her I knew the truth about her death.  I was still skeptical as to why, so I asked her the real reason she did it because I wanted to know the truth.  

I kid you not, as soon as I had finished the sentence, ""Why did you really do it Grandma?"" I felt someone lean over into my ear.  Someone (I'm assuming my Grandma) whispered ""Eddie"" into my ear.  I felt a cold breath on my ear and neck as I heard the words, and was immediately terrified.  I whipped myself out of bed and turned my lamp on.  No one was there.  

The reason I was so terrified is because my grandpa's name is Edward.  I have never seen or heard from my grandmother since that day.  I admit that I have tried talking to her again a couple of times, but I haven't gotten a response.  A part of me wants to believe that she stayed on earth as a spirit in order to tell me the truth, but I doubt it.  All I know is that its too much of a coincidence that I heard my grandpa's name as I was trying to talk to my grandma.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_14chis,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/14chis/me_an_disturbing_encounter_with_my_deceased/,

I feel this place is more appropriate since it all really happened to me. ,The1nOnlySilent,54,8,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/12d08h/ghost_stalker_i_posted_this_on_rnosleep_about_a/,"I have had a ghost following me around for the past 7 years now. It used to really freak me out; but I guess I've gotten used to him.

It started when I was 16 and I had a dream; and not just any normal dream. Usually I am a lucid dreamer and I always know when I am asleep and can change my dreams as I please. Also, there is always something misplaced in dreams and it is very rarely exact.
In the dream I woke up to my dog getting up because she needed to go outside. I am a clutter bug and my room was always pretty messy with random thing lying about or piled places, so for everything to be in their exact spots is really odd thinking back, which is probably why I thought I was really awake. Anywho, so I walk down the hall and into the entry way opening up the heavy wooden door followed by the glass door to get outside where the entire neighborhood is normal and the weather was just as it really was. After my dog was finished with her business she started barking at something, as she tends to do, and started running after it. I just figured she saw a raccoon or something and walked down from the porch into the yard trying to get her to come back. She circled completely around my neighbors house then came running straight at me still chasing something. Then I get hit and knocked to the ground; I freaked out and jumped up running up to the door calling Ginger to come with me. I tried to pull the glass door shut first, but it is a hydrolic hinge and wasn't cooperating so I went the slam the heavy wooden door shut, but something hit up against it and was pushing it back against me.

I woke up completely startled at this point relieved that it was just a dream, but still really scared because the entire time I had thought I was awake. When I finally fell back asleep I slipped right back into the dream where it left off. My mom had woken up and came out to see what all the commotion was and about that time the door flung open and whatever it was got into my mother. At this point I got really angry and started yelling asking what it was and what it wanted. It then spoke through my mother saying his name was Nathaniel and he died in the area during the Civil War when he was just 19. I woke up after learning who he was.

Ever since I had that dream weird things started happening. There were 2 phones in my house both on the same phone line. One was in the dining room and one was in my bedroom. Sometimes just the phone in my room would ring; if someone else went back to answer it, it would just be a dead line. If I answered it, there would be static and I could hear breathing and the light mumbling of a male voice. Also, one night I was up later than the rest of my family out on the computer when I heard noises from the garage. The garage door had been shut for at least 3 hours already at this point. When I went out there the garage door to the side my car is parked on was just going up and down. My mom heard it as well and came out and she watched it just going up and down with me for awhile after checking the sensors to make sure nothing was in the way. After a few minutes I said, ""Nathaniel, stop it!"" and the door went down and stayed down. That was pretty weird.
Another thing that would happen even after I moved out of my parents house, while I was living in the dorms, at my first apartment, and even at the one I am living in now; my friends will call me and I will be completely alone and they will stop and ask who I am with. They say they can hear a boys voice coming from my end of the phone and it's always the same one. They can never make out what he is saying though.

When I left for my first year of college I came back that first weekend to pick up things I had forgotten. Shortly after I left to go back, my dad called me and said he thinks Nathan was upset that I left again as after I pulled out all of a sudden all of the mail that had been lying on the counter went flying across the living room like it had been thrown.
At my first apartment, I felt like I was watched a lot, still feel that way. One morning I woke up with a hand print shaped bruise just above my elbow. I thought maybe I grabbed myself in my sleep or something, but then I put my own hand over it and the hand print was much larger than my hands could have made. I have some pretty small hands.

Oh! I almost forgot! Awhile after I told my family about it my sister and I decided to do some research on the web. We found a boy with the name of Nathaniel who died during the Civil War... there was a picture of his grave stone... he had the same last name as us. Talk about weird!

TL;DR: Ghost boy has been following me around doing weird stuff for about 8 years now.

Edit: Since originally posting this a year ago, I was at my grandpa's house with my parents and somehow Nathaniel came up as a topic. My mom said when I was little and we had first moved into that house (I was 5), she had heard me playing with a kid outside, but she never saw anyone. When I came in from playing she asked who I was playing with, and I just told her ""the boy"". She said I could invite him in to play if I wanted to, but I told her that he wasn't allowed to go inside of houses.

I've never really strongly believed in the paranormal until this happened to me. I haven't talked about it to anybody, but it does feel good to get it off my chest. I'm also very open to any advice you all may have on how to stop this from happening.

My family has an old house in a small town in louisiana. The backyard leads right into a river. One night a couple years ago, a few friends and I got into a canoe to ride around for a while. We came across a houseboat about ten minutes down the river that was tied to a bridge. It has been there for as long as I can remember, but I've never seen anybody use it. 

As a little bit of background, this was not a normal houseboat. It was an older kind that basically just looked like a little shed on a flat steering platform, hence why nobody ever tried to steal it and how it was so easy for us to get inside.

Being a bunch of dumb teenagers, we decided to investigate.Two friends managed to get kick in the door and we were immediately flooded with an absolutely horrific smell followed by what sounded like somebody screaming underwater or from behind a wall. The screaming only lasted a few seconds, but we were frozen in place while it was happening. When we could think straight again, we got out of there pretty quickly and silently agreed not to talk about it again. I haven't seen any of them in a few years.

I went back the next year with my sister. The first night we were there, I woke up at exactly 3am for no reason and looked at the window. There was the silhouette of a man there who looked like he was shaking horribly and swaying back and forth. I yelled for my sister, but by the time she got there he was gone. The next night the same thing happened, but this time I heard the muffled screaming from the boat as well. 

This happens to me every single night in that house at exactly 3am, whether I'm asleep or not. I just get a strange urge to look at the window, and I feel like something very bad will happen if I don't. The man stays there screaming anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes each time. Afterwards, he sort of fades off, but in a very strange way. I can't find words to explain it.

My two cousins have mentioned seeing something like that as well at the house, even though I never told anybody the full story. Neither of them mentioned any screaming, however, or the time being exactly 3am. 

A friend who lives down there mentioned in passing that they took the boat out of the water a few weeks ago. There were no reports of anything strange. I really thought for the longest time that a dead body must have been in there because of the smell, but I was too terrified to go to the police because I wasn't supposed to be there anyways. I haven't been back to the house since they took the boat away, but I'm hoping the man in the window will be gone when I do.

This is something that I've resigned myself to. I know it's going to happen, and I don't try to tamper with it or fight it. A lot of strange things happen in that house and that town, but this is the only thing I have no logical explanation for.

In 6th grade I had a dog for a brief period of time named Snoopy. I walked him every morning before leaving to school. 

This particular morning I was running late so my mom agreed to drive me. I was in a rush to avoid being tardy so I quickly leashed snoopy and dashed to the garage exit to our house. 

I raced Snoopy to the door and threw myself against it winning the race and successfully getting Snoopy super excited to take a morning poop. 

Without really thinking about it i stopped dead in my tracks. (I was holding the door open at this point and simply standing in the doorway looking outside) 

I was suddenly filled with fear and i couldn't understand why. I found it very hard to move. I glanced down and noticed snoopy who was extremely excited just moments ago was standing perfectly still staring forward. 
I was about to try to move forward when I heard this chilling voice. It sounded like a young kid chatting in a normal tone. The chilling part was the fact that the direction the voice was coming from seemed to constantly change. At first I thought the kid was right outside the door to my right then much further away then even behind me. It was also in a language I had never heard before (this isn't too weird since I only knew Spanish and English at the time but I live in a suburb where English is pretty much the only language in existence). The language sounded like gibberish and just a series of made up words strung together. 

Another weird thing was that despite never hearing this language before I felt like I was always on the cusp of understanding what it was trying to say but could never quite make it out. 

By this time another child began responding to the first voice and the two sounded like they were having a pleasant conversation judging by the tone. 

My feeling of unexplained fear intensified as the voices began to change age. They became deeper and much more horrifying. I glanced down at snoopy again to see his reaction to the events still talking place. He remained motionless. 

After what felt like 10 minutes of listening in fear to these voices they suddenly stopped. I suddenly regained my composure and burst out the door in hopes of finding some sort of source. I saw no one in all directions. 

The story doesn't really end there. I was overcome with curiosity by this event and quickly memorized some ""words"" that I had heard in hopes of ask jeevesing them at school (not terribly Internet savvy at this point) 

While driving to school I noticed (while repeating these 10 or so ""words"" in my head) that I began to just suddenly forget them. I tried to focus but was shocked to find that a word I had just repeated in my head was suddenly gone. 

Within seconds my 10 key ""words"" diminished into only two. In hopes to grasp on to them I muttered one out loud. (if I was to spell out the sound I made it would be something like wumbo or womba. Silly I know but the pronunciation was kind of guttural and the middle of the word was extended like wuuuuuumbo. Still silly out of context but what can I say that's what it was.) 

Anyway my mom jumped slightly at the sound of my voice. ""what did you say?"" she looked kind of scared. Feeling silly I explained my experience hoping she might have heard it too. To my disappointment she had no idea what I was talking about and thought I was trying to scare her so I dropped it. Returning to my memory exercise I realized that I forgot the last term. 

I used ask jeeves later at school but of course got nothing from searching wumbo. 

Nothing similar occurred after that event and I still don't know exactly what I heard but all explanations paranormal or not are welcome.

I don't know if its worth noting that I've seen moving shadows or ""shadow people"" twice in that house. Once when I was much younger and the other time just recently over winter break (in college now.) 

I don't know what I hoped to gain be retelling this story (I don't think about it much anymore) but maybe someone will get something out of it. If anyone has had a similar experience please do not hesitate to share. I've conveyed this to some close friends and girlfriends throughout my life but most never seem to find it that weird or relate.

I don't know if this can be explained away by medical reasons, but google has been no help at all so thought of check if anyone else has any explanation.

We moved into a townhouse about 6 months ago. It's fairly new so you wouldn't expect it to be haunted, I'd say maybe 20 or 30 years old at most. 

Anyway my daughter was 14 months old when we moved in, and we put her into a toddler bed. That was fine for about 2 months, and I was surprised at how well she transitioned. Then one night I put her in bed and she panicked, reaching out for me. I tried to soothe her, but every night for a week she just cried and cried like she was terrified. Eventually from sheer exhaustion I put the portacot up for her and she went straight to sleep.

I wouldn't think this was too strange except for some other weird things. One night my partner woke me up when he got home from work, saying 'don't pretend you're asleep, I heard you walking around and shutting the cupboards.' I really had been asleep, and although I'd heard that sort of thing before when no one was upstairs , I had mostly ignored it. 

Then just now my daughter went for a bath. It is winter in Australia, but I live in north Queensland so our idea of cold is really not the same as other peoples. It's a warmish day, about 24 Celsius at least. Anyway I put her in the bath, as normal, then went to her room to get her some clothes. All of a sudden she screamed, and I ran into the bathroom to find her huddled in the corner of the tub shivering, her skin a little blue. The water was still warm. I pulled her out and wrapped her in a towel, then took her to her room. I tried to take the towel off to dress her but she cried and tried to stop me. I touched her skin beneath the towel and she was really cold all over. I took the towel off and cuddled her in a blanket for about five minutes, but she was still really cold to the touch and her lips were blue. I managed to wrestle her into some warm clothes and now we're outside in the sun.

That really scared me, she's an otherwise healthy, happy kid. She doesn't get sick and the screaming when we were trying to get her to sleep in a bed was terrible, and completely out of the ordinary for her.

1343678976.0,39,self.Thetruthishere,xeprb,"[ME] [FAM] My grandmother was just ""checking in""",breannaland733,46,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/xeprb/me_fam_my_grandmother_was_just_checking_in/,"After reading and enjoying other posts, I felt it was finally time I did one of my own.  Over the years I have had many unexplainable experiences.  Eventually, I hope to share all of them with you, but I'll start with the first one to leave a big impact on me.  Most of the experiences that happened prior to this one happened when I was too young to remember them so I only know them through stories my family has told me.  This one involved both me and my dad.  Sorry if it's a little lengthy.

When I was 13, my parents had a small side business they would operate in their spare time making personalized children's books.  This would require traveling to arts and crafts fairs and various other festivals around the state to set up booths to sell these wares.  One night we returned from a festival and started unloading the van as usual.  My mom, brother, and I had taken our suitcases and what not into the house while my dad stayed outside unloading the tables and equipment in the garage alone until we had finished inside and could get back outside to help.

I was in my room emptying my suitcase when I felt a shiver up my spine.  The air in my room got thicker, almost stuffy.  It was the same feeling we used to get whenever my friends and I made contact with something on the Ouija board.  The temperature wouldn't necessarily drop, but the air would get thicker and we'd usually start shivering even though none of us were cold. (Not sure else how to explain it, but we all kind of described it the same way and this was the closest thing the experience felt like.)

All of a sudden I felt like I was called outside.  I never heard my name nor felt uncomfortable in my bedroom, I just felt like I was supposed to be in a different room.  I leave my room and walk out into the living room just in time to see my dad standing in the kitchen with this look of total bewilderment on his face.  One look was all it took.  I instantly *knew* what had happened without him having to say a word.

It's important to note here that I knew what had happened because the only times I had ever seen this look on his face were the 2 previous times he'd seen the ghost of my grandmother, his mother, who had died when I was 4.  Both of the previous experiences had happened in our old house, but both in my bedroom.

My mom asks, ""What's wrong?"" as I entered the kitchen.  Before my dad could utter the words, I answered for him saying, ""You just saw Grandma, didn't you?"" He looked at me in further disbelief, like how did you know, but didn't address that concern and said ""Yeah, but this time she spoke.""  

The first time he saw her, she was standing outside my bedroom window when he went in to check on me while I was sleeping.  She appeared to be standing outside the window and had a soft glow about her.  He said she had a peaceful look on her face and was just watching me sleep.  When she noticed he was watching her, he said she turned to him, smiled, put her hands together as if to pray, bowed her head, and then disappeared.  The second time he saw her was at the same house.  It was at night, but I was spending the night off somewhere.  He passed by my room and something his eye on the periphery.  He looked in my room and saw her sitting on the edge of my bed, looking in the direction of the TV as if she was watching it, but it was off.  After watching her for a few seconds, she turned to him, smiled, and disappeared.

This time was different.  He said he pulled a table out of the back of the van and was carrying it into the garage when he felt like he was being watched.  He turned around to see my grandmother hovering (as he described it) next to the fence.  He said he described it as hovering because she was on eye level with him which wouldn't have been possible (he's 6'1"" and she was 5'4"") and he couldn't see the bottom half of her legs.  He said it just kinda blurred out past her knees, but she was wearing the white dress in which she was buried.  He was in shock when he first saw her, but said he felt surprisingly calm.  He couldn't think to do anything else but say, ""Hi, mom.""  He said she smiled and said, ""I just wanted to check in to tell you to stop worrying all the time.  And I'm so proud of Breanna.""

Well when he was relaying this story, I'll be honest, that last bit scared the shit out of me.  I was always intrigued by the paranormal and usually tried to seek it out.  I loved doing seances with my mom at slumber parties, light as feather stiff as a board stuff, the Ouija board, ghost stories, you name it.  Nothing ever really phased me.  If anything creepy every happened, it sparked my curiosity and made me press further.  This should've thrilled me.  I was the grandkid closest to my grandmother before she passed.  I spent every day with her instead of going to day care while my parents worked.  I loved her, but the idea of seeing her just pop up in my room one day creeped me out.

After he told me this, I was afraid to go back into my room by myself.  After all, the only other times he'd seen her was in MY room.  He convinced me to go back in with him, and we sat there talking about it.  He theorized that she was probably coming to me because I was the one closest to her.  I also had her old bedroom furniture so he thought maybe the familiar surroundings were part of what drew her back to my room as well.  He convinced me to not be afraid of my room by explaining that she loved me and would never do anything to intentionally scare me.  He felt like our discussion was enough because she would hear that I was scared and not try to show herself to me until she thought I was ready to handle it, if that time ever came. 

I accepted this explanation and as he was getting ready to leave, I felt that same thickness in the air come back.  He was looking at stuff on my shelves when he noticed a sand art picture that I'd gotten on one of our beach trips.  It had colored water and sand in it that, when flipped over, would make different shapes and patterns and swirls in it.  He asked me what it was because he didn't remember seeing it but thought it was cool.  When he flipped it over, the shape of a heart appeared in the dead center of the little 4x6 frame.  The heart was made of the water with the sand lining the edges of it.  The sand appeared to be suspended mid-air in order to make the heart shape appear.  Now, there may be an explanation to debunk that, but not knowing anything about buoyancy or anything like that, we were both unable to come up with a logical explanation for it.  We both saw the shape at the same time and he said, ""See?  That's her way of telling you she understands.  You won't have to worry about seeing her until you're ready.""

The picture stayed like that for a long time after.  Unfortunately, it was damaged in the move to our house after that one, but I never flipped it back over after that last time.  My dad was right too.  I never saw her until I was ready.  Sorry the story was a bit long-winded, but if you liked this and are interested in my other experiences, I'll share those too.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_xeprb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/xeprb/me_fam_my_grandmother_was_just_checking_in/,
1343347947.0,40,self.Thetruthishere,x7xfd,[ME] My first experience with the paranormal at age 10 at a bible summer camp.,thecatmarie,47,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/x7xfd/me_my_first_experience_with_the_paranormal_at_age/,"I am going to apologize in advance, this is going to be a long read.

In the year 2000 when I was 10 years old my parents sent me to a 5 day summer camp in Huntsville, Ontario. This camp was definitely a bible camp, and being raised without religion I felt quite uncomfortable there, but I got along well with my peers.

Me and 7 other girls were staying in the room on the far right, and there were 3 other rooms on the main floor, and upstairs is where the camp counselors bunked. The main floor had a very high ceiling and near the top was a small square door which attached to where the camp counselors were staying. I was staying along the right wall on the bottom bunk. On the third night me and my bunk mates were having a blast just talking and telling jokes, but our camp counselor opened the little door at the top of the room and told us to be quiet, so we all went to bed.

Out of nowhere I hear Brianna yelling ""Cat wake up right now! Cat wake up"" and being the light sleeper I was I immediately woke up, I didn't know how long I had slept for. I then hear Angel saying ""Cat, look over to the bunk in front of you!"" I was facing the wall so I turn around and see a black figure with long, curly hair sitting on the ladder leading up to the top bunk on the bed in front of mine. The moonlight illuminated the entire room, and this figure was completely opaque, shaking (her, I think?) long curly hair. I looked around the room and noticed all of the girls were all accounted for and definitely awake. I stared at this thing for what seemed like an eternity. Everyone of the girls were were being completely hysterical and crying, but I was dead silent, I couldn't make a peep. I was completely terrified to the point I couldn't blink or even move. I mean what could I have done? The thing was sitting there right before my eyes. Then this figure stands up and jumps off of the ladder and just stood at the edge of the bed for a moment. All of the girls screaming ""Cat, get out of there now! To which the figure moved around in almost a robotic way and started walking towards me, I finally then find the nerve to book it out of the bottom bunk and run to the other side of the room. I run up to Brianna and Angel's bunk and climb the ladder as quickly as I could. At this point I started becoming hysterical and crying like the rest of them. The figure was still standing near my bed. Angel and I started hugging, and I was too afraid to even open my eyes after what I had seen. Angel decides to jump down off of the bunk and turn the light on and the figure was gone. I guess we've made a lot of noise and the camp counselor opened the little door and told us to keep it down. We had told her what we'd seen and she came downstairs to investigate. She came into the room and told us ""There's nothing here, your mind was probably playing tricks on you. Back to bed now."" All of the girls including myself in the room were still pretty upset and scared, and just sat up in our bunks talking about what we had seen.

About 5 minutes after we hear screams coming from the room directly across the hall from us. We all started crying again, and the camp counselor opened the little door and told us ""See what you've started, you have everyone in the cabin scared!"" the camp counselor went to investigate and we turned on the lights in our room and opened the door. We hear one of the girls in the room across from ours say while crying ""Something lifted our bunk, please please don't make us stay in here! It's going to kill us!"" To which the counselor sternly responded with ""That's impossible, now quiet down and go to bed. This is the last time I am going to say this.""

After about 20 minutes of quietly talking, we all went to bed. Nothing else strange happened for the duration of the camp trip. I had exchanged phone numbers with the girls.

About a week after the camp trip had ended I contacted both Angel and Brianna and asked them if they remembered that night and they both said yes, and they said they'd never forget it. This was the very first experience I had with the paranormal, but certainly not the last.

I lay in bed last night trying to rationalise what I saw at work yesterday but I just can't. I work in a charity (thrift) shop and was in the sorting room with two volunteers. They had just arrived for their shift and we were having a good old natter before we got started. 


During our conversation, a loud rattling noise grabbed our attentions. It was a plastic, portable rail on wheels that had about 10 empty plastic coat hangers on it. As we watched, it tipped gracefully to the left at a 45 degree angle (right wheels off the floor). We were stunned to silence. The rail then swung, equally gracefully, all the way over to the right at a 45 degree angle (left wheels off the floor). We looked on as the rail then snapped back to an all wheels on the floor position in a sudden jerking slam that left the empty hangers swinging violently on the rail. 

The whole event took mere seconds and confused the heckers out of us. Baffled, we decided to have a cup of tea in the kitchen and discuss it before getting back to our work. During our discussion, none of us said we felt scared by it, just utterly confused. I cant understand why it didn't just fall over. It should have fallen when it tipped to the left but it decided that it was going to break the laws of physics instead and swing back in the opposite direction before coming to an abrupt end back where it started.

The shop is housed in an extremely old building and from time to time, I have felt someone watching me when I've been in that room alone but I've never seen anything like this before.


I'm going to try to find out more by chatting to the shop managers on either side of us to see if anything's happened to them in the past as we've only been here 6 months. Intrestingly enough, I volunteered for a short time in the same premises 5 years ago when it was ran by a different charity and I felt uneasy then too but I wasn't there as much as I am now.I also might try evp work or something. I promise if anything comes of it, I will let you guys know. I'm kind of secretly hoping it was just a one off as I'm often working in that room alone and I'm a big wimp.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_tuf5j,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tuf5j/work_experience_left_us_baffled/,
1317429214.0,46,self.Thetruthishere,kx1ty,Beware of rental houses,dntworryihaveadegree,49,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kx1ty/beware_of_rental_houses/,"I apologize if this is kind of long, but I tried to not leave anything out. I’m really glad to have stumbled upon this subreddit, because I’ve been wanting to share this story for quite a while.  I’ve changed the names of the people involved, just to keep our privacy. First, I’ll give you a little background on the circumstances and myself. The house is located in Georgia, about 45 minutes north of Atlanta. I lived there with my boyfriend (Tyler) and a female friend of mine (Kate), from July 2008-July 2009.  The house was your average split-level house, with three bedrooms upstairs on the main level, and a garage/basement bedroom downstairs. My boyfriend and I slept in the master bedroom on the main floor, but he also had a futon and some of his things in one of the other rooms upstairs. My roommate, Caitlin, lived in the spacious basement room. 

Not long after we moved in, I started to sense that something was…off. I’m not a religious person, and I can’t say that I believe in much, but there was definitely something wrong with that house.  My first actual experience began when I was home alone one evening, studying for class. I was in the living room with the TV on, but not really paying attention to it. The remote was on coffee table when I noticed the lighting change on TV, so I looked up from my book and saw that it had switched to the Jesus channel. Weird, but nothing that can’t be explained by some sort of technological glitch. Well, from that day on, this happened every time I was by myself. No matter what channel the TV was on, or where the remote was located, it would switch to the Jesus channel once or twice a sitting. Albeit freaky, that’s not really anything to get worked up about.  A few nights later, I was by myself, sitting in the living room, when I heard someone running up and down the hallway. I thought it was one of our cats at first, until I looked to my right and saw both of them lying on the couch, staring intently down the hallway. I would talk to my roommates about it and they’d laugh and say I was crazy...that is, until things started happening to them. 

One weekend my boyfriend and I were out of town, and my roommate was in her bathroom getting ready to go out with some friends.  Her bathroom was located on the main floor, next to the master bedroom. As she was getting ready, she heard a loud thud come from my bathroom, which is inside of my bedroom. She thought maybe one of our cats had gotten inside my room or something, so she went in to see what the little rascals were up to. After opening the bedroom door and looking around, she realized that neither of our cats was in the room. So, she went back to her bathroom, and a couple minutes later she heard what sounded like a blow-dryer coming from my bathroom. She thought it was better not to investigate the noise this time, and high-tailed it out of the house for the night. 

Flash forward to a couple months later. I woke up one morning and Kate told me about something that happened to her and her boyfriend that night. They had just lain down to go to sleep, when her boyfriend suddenly asked her why she tapped his forehead. My roommate said she did nothing of the sort, as she was lying on her side facing the opposite side of the bed. A few moments later, something tapped her on her forehead. She thought it was her boyfriend being a smartass, but he too had turned on his side, and was facing the opposite side of the bed. I thought that was odd, so I went to tell my boyfriend what happened. However, before I could get out the story, he told me how something tapped his forehead last night when we were laying in bed. Now, if you knew my boyfriend, you would know that he’s incredibly logical and skeptically of all things paranormal. 

Throughout our time at the house, things would go missing or end up in places where no one had put them. Without mentioning anything that went on in the house, our friends would get weird feelings when they were visiting us. The weirdest thing that happened in that house happened to Kate and I whilst we were sitting in the garage one morning. We were sitting in this corner of the garage where you can see the garage door when you look to your right. The garage door closest to us was fully opened, because we were smoking a cigarette. We happened to glance over to the door during our conversation, and we see this Jamaican/African looking guy walking down our driveway. We thought that was kind of odd, and since Tyler was asleep upstairs, we quickly closed the garage door. Kate ran upstairs to look out the window and keep an eye on this guy, while I went and woke up Tyler. Kate said she didn’t see him at all when she was looking out the front window of the house; the garage doors are clearly visible from this window. After I woke him up, I ran out back, he ran out front, and Kate went around the side of the house. We looked all around the outside of the house, and we even walked up our street. This all happened in a period of about 2-minutes. The guy was nowhere to be found.  I know this could have been some random dude, but I’m almost certain that we would have seen him somewhere around the outside of the house, or at least on our street. There weren’t any random cars parked in the cul-de-sac either, so it’s not like he quickly sped off. 

I might also mention that my boyfriend started to develop chronic and intense leg pains. He went to numerous doctors and specialists, and they couldn’t determine what was causing them. He would also wake up in the middle of the night with severe stomach pains. We spoke with our landlord, had the house checked for mold, and gas leaks; nothing was found. He suffered from these ailments until the day we moved out of that house, and he’s never experienced them again. 

Prior to living in this house, I never believed in ghosts or anything even remotely paranormal. I know that a lot of people are skeptical of things like this, until they experience it first hand.  Although I wish I had, I never checked the records or old newspapers, so I don’t know if anything terrible ever happened to anyone there before we moved in. All I know is, every time I move into a new place, I’m always a little anxious the first couple of weeks. Luckily, my boyfriend and I have moved twice since living in the house and nothing remotely weird has happened to either of us. 

TL;DR Moved into a rental house, weird shit happened, now I believe in ghosts/the paranormal/unknown shit.

A couple of years ago, I went on a study abroad trip with my university to Australia for a couple of months. We started in Darwin and traveled south. The bus ride itself was pretty uneventful (except for me and my friend being accidentally left at Devil's marbles for a few hours but that's another story). We stayed at a hostel in Alice Springs and got up before dawn to drive to Uluru. The rest of the students had decided to go back to sleep for the bus ride but I was looking out the window at what little I could make of the scenery. It was that time right before dawn when you're first able to make out your surroundings.      

The bus slowed down to park and made a turn into an empty lot and that's when I saw it. An extremely large shadow walking through the bush. I'm a bad judge of height but it was taller than any human I had ever seen, perhaps 10ft tall with extremely elongated arms and legs. Even though there was enough light to make out details of the landscape the figure appeared completely, well, detail-less. Like it was smooth, black, and featureless. The black was a stark contrast to the rest of the scenery, as there was a thin mist in the area. 

I've seen flashes of shadows driving before or something out of the corner of my eye but this was different as I was able to watch it for several slow seconds as he walked in this odd swaying, dipping motion with a distinct grace, moving effortlessly across the bush. I felt like as soon as I saw it I had been electrocuted, every hair standing up and skin prickling. I tried to wake my friend but by the time she looked out the window it was gone. 
    
Im sure this could  be explained away by possible sleep deprivation or just seeing shadows but I personally feel what I saw was real.

There was a plaque outside my dorm explaining about the saxon burialground that was excavated during the construction of my dorm. Even skeptics left this base questioning the paranormal after living in this building. Here is a portion of my story. 

  One night while asleep I had a series of 3 dreams that were completely unrelated, yet ended in similar ways. at the end of each dream I was chased by a tall(7 footish), skinny humanoid with grey/faint purple skin and a white/bone mask. It may have also been wearing bone armor on its forearms and chest, not sure. After the 3rd dream, I woke up in my room breathing heavy, but relieved to be away from my pursuer. 

  Then I felt it. I felt a hand rest on my head and move up and down a bit. I looked up and a shadow in the shape of the figure in my dream was standing there, me head in his hand. At this point I lost consciousness. The figure was back in my final dream of the night. 

  I awoke the next morning ad tried to forget what I had dreamed, and told noone.

  About a month later I was drinking a few beers with friends and one of them(who lived one floor down from me) told us a story about how he awoke one night after having weird dreams to see a 7 foot tall shadow standing at the foot of his bed watching him, then he fell back asleep uncontrollably. 

  At this point I told my story for the first time, and the description of the figure was eerily close to what my friend had experienced. 

  For a long time I  have searched the internet for any clues, and have found little. If anyone knows of a spirit or whatever that may match this, I would love to hear about it.

I grew up in a very rural town in East Texas right along the Sabine River which is just a stone’s throw away from Louisiana. My house was at the end of a farm to market road which ended with my house and a few others. Behind my house was a huge field that stretch all the way back towards the woods which ran to the Sabine.

Where the paved road ended there was a metal gate with a cattle guard which blocked a dirt road. Very rural. If you're looking straight on at my house the dirt road would be to your right. We would walk down the dirt road every once in a while by hoping the fence or crawling through it. No big deal. Me and my dad or my friends would walk down the road and just look around, walk, talk, you know just looking around.
To the left of my house was a field and an old barn. On the paved road that led to our house was a few houses that set off the road. The paved road ended when you reached our house and turned to gravel. At that point was where the field started. It was small and led to a tree line right by our property. If you walked the tree line parallel to our house it would take you to an old creek bed that led to the Sabine. The creek bed had a thick canopy of trees, not much light in many areas and went on for about a mile or more and went right to the water’s edge.

So this is our play area. This is our forest and adventureland and we made use of everything around there.
One day my friends over and we're around 10 years old. So, we decide to go exploring and walk up and down the tree lined creek, go walk in the field next to my house and look in the old barn in the field. We were out in the barn and noticed a few weird things. There were the typical old barn features - hay, dirt, old weathered wood - but hanging from the roof was bones tied to the end of rope. Kind of weird. We made up stories about how it was voodoo or some other crap but didn't really care about it.
After exploring the barn we decided to walk down the creek bed and go to the river. I had my bb gun so we were shooting trees. Basically being 10 year old kids. We walk down to the river and throw rocks in the water, play with the dead gars washed up on the shore and decide there's nothing else to do so we walk back.

As we get back to the field next to the barn we both had this weird feeling like we were being watched. That's when we see it. I don't know what it was. I know that we both saw it and it's there just watching us. We looked at each other and asked, ""do you see that?” We both did. It was tall, impossible dark, like almost black, and standing at the edge of the tree line almost in the field staring at us. We couldn't make out much detail other than the height -around 7 feet. The look - dark, almost black and shaggy. It had its arms down but holding them out from its body so that we could make out the figure of two arms and two legs. Impossible large and black.

When we asked each other if we saw it, we just turned and ran back to my house as fast as possible. Scared us to death. It makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. I have no idea what it was and neither does he. We talked about it last time I saw him and he pretty much confirmed what I remember. Scary as hell to think we were walking alone in the woods with whatever it was following us.

Any thoughts?

I would be very interested to know if anyone here has had or heard of similar experiences. 

This isn't a particularly 'scary' story, but it's one of those experiences that has changed my view on the nature of our world...

It started about 15 years ago. My (now) wife and I were coming home from a day out, pulling into the underground parking lot of our condo complex. As we entered the underground, we felt a strange rushing of wind around us, like the A/C in the car had suddenly come on. We both reacted by reaching for the console air controls, but it was clearly turned off. Assuming something had broken, our next reaction was to put our hands in front of the vents to see where the unexpected breeze was coming from, but we found it was not emanating from any of the vents, the windows all being closed as well.

This really perplexed us, but as it was an older car, we assumed something had broken somewhere, and we'd look into it later on. The strange swirling breeze continued against our hands and faces for maybe 30 or 40 seconds longer as we wound our way to the bottom level of the garage, then stopping as suddenly as it started. Again, it was an old car, so we didn't give it much thought, but we both noted that it seemed a strange an unnatural breeze - being both warm and cold at the same time. It was slightly unnerving, but still pretty low on the weirdness scale.

We noted the time as exactly 7:45 - it was memorable as my wife did not want to miss Star Trek which started at 8:00, and we were happy to have just made it home in time after being on the road for several hours.

The next day we arrived at work (we worked together at the local university) to a very somber environment. We soon learned that another employee, around our age, had hanged herself the evening before. She had been hit by a motorcycle several years earlier and suffered serious spinal damage... the constant pain and lack of mobility finally won out and she decided to put an end to her own suffering.

This young lady who had died was quite a loner, but my wife and I befriended her about a year earlier finding we had quite a bit in common and enjoying our time together. It turned out she was an avid equestrian and took us horseback riding through the hills from time to time. A few days before her death, while out riding the trails, she had remarked how nice it was to have friends again and not to be so alone.

When my wife and I learned of the time of her death - 'shortly before 8:00 PM' we looked at each other, a strange understanding dawning in our minds... had our friend popped by for one last visit somehow? Oddly, after losing a close friend, we took some comfort in the possibility (implausible as it seemed), and the memory of the event stayed clear in our minds for years.

A few years later, shortly after our wedding, my then pregnant wife and I were relaxing in the living room of our new little home. Suddenly - without any kind of eerie prelude - we found ourselves surrounded by that unmistakable cold/warm swirling breeze again. While not discomforting of it's own, we looked knowingly at each other and became very concerned... Was this another 'visit' from a loved one on the way out? My wife was quite concerned for the baby - a fear quickly allayed by a few solid kicks shortly after the breeze stopped. Sure enough, a few hours later, the phone rang. My grandfather, who I had a very close relationship with and held in very high regard, had passed from a stroke at my parents house some 1200 miles away.

Over the years, this has happened maybe a half-dozen more times with very strong predictive success. Every time we feel that unnatural, sourceless breeze swirling around us, holding up our hands, feeling it move around us, we look at each other, worriedly, and wait for the phone to ring. We've become so accustomed to it, that we've even started to speak out loud and say things like ""Who is this? We'll miss you - don't worry about us, we'll be fine"". In case you're wondering, speaking to the breeze has never had any effect on the duration or intensity of the winds.

Now my wife and I are both fairly objective, skeptical thinkers. We've both studied psychology/neuroscience/biochem, and are aware of how the mind can fabricate all sorts of sensations and memories, especially in a group setting. However, a good scientist can't ignore evidence even when it flies in the face of their current world view, and multiple predictive successes over the course of years with no false positives starts to count as 'significant' in my books, even if we can't initiate an experiment to test the theory out (well, I guess we could, but you know).

At any rate, this phenomenon has really changed my perception of the human condition. Whether the 'wind' phenomenon is physical or manifested in our minds is unclear, but it is somehow real. It has reliably preceded the passing of several relatives and close friends, with a very strong correlation to the actual time of death (15 minutes one way or the other in every case).

Take away from this what you will, but I'm not pulling your chain to try and scare or mislead you. If nothing else, I hope these observations would serve to help grow the body of evidence leading to a more testable theory on the whole 'ghost' phenomenon. If you have any questions or would like more details, I'll try to fill in any blanks I may have left.

It was a nice place to live, and was becoming much more comfortable for me to live in as time went on. It was hard to grasp the aspect that this was MY house now. No one had ever died there, and my great-grandfather just decided that he didn't wt to live in the trailer anymore. 

One night in November I was in the master bathroom taking a shower. Usual routine and when I stepped out and put a towel on I grabbed the hair brush. I dropped it, bent down to pick it up and something caught my eye. Sitting next to
 the wall and toilet was a little girl. Black hair, black lips and a huge smile on her face. Something that still gives me chills to think about. Her smile faded and she began to pout and cry. For whatever reason I could not move, I sat there crying myself frozen. I remember feeling like my heart was about to explode. She then just vanished in front of me. Just all of a sudden vanished. 
Shaking, I turned and looked at the mirror, ready to scream when a woman in a white and orange shirt and blouse gave me a sad look. When I looked in the mirror she grabbed my shoulder. Her blonde hair was tall, and she had on showgirl makeup. It felt like a cold mist was on my shoulder. Something about her made me feel safe suddenly, and I stopped crying. Still terrified, she smiled and I screamed loudly finally, it felt like I had been unable to scream the whole time. I screamed and ran into the adjoining bedroom. My mother ran to me. 

I dont remember anything after that, except what my mother tells me. She said I was so scared I was shaking and hyperventilating. I kept saying there was people in the bathroom and my father checked everywhere, just as scared as I was. 

Apparently after calming me down I told her every detail of the girl and woman. She said she got upset, and told me that today was a 5 year anniversary that my great grandmother had died. She remembered the outfit I described, and said the hair ans makeup was exact.

**Mystery may be solved. Thanks to BurmecianDragoon for the information.
  This dog may have been what is known as a Shuck (also known as Black Shuck, Old Shuck, ghostly black dog).

""Sometimes it is reported to be a friend and protector of women; the shadowy canine walks with lone women and accompanies them to their destination, ensuring their safe passage at night. Most often, although the vision of this creature understandably frightens people, it does not harm them in any way.""  

""The size of this spirit dog has been reported to be everything from that of a large dog to the size of a full-grown horse.**

  I was around fifteen years old when this happened to me, so this was many, many years ago. It was during one of the school breaks, from what I recall, so I had been out at a friends house all night. And when I say all night, I do mean all night. By the time I started walking home, it was around 4 or so in the morning.  It was not a long walk from my friends house to mine, only about a mile and a half, but I had to cross a semi busy street in the process. 

  It was a nice evening from what I recall, although rather dark. Some of the city streetlights had been turned off, as they do to save electricity. I was walking down the block towards the upcoming major street. The middle class, suburban houses typical to the San Fernando Valley (where I lived way back then) quiet and dark. No cars on the street I was currently walking on, although every once in a while a car would flash by on the street up ahead. 

  About halfway up the block, I hear a rustling sound coming from the yard of one of the houses. I turned to look, and as I expected, it was a dog. As many times as I had walked back and forth to my friends house, I had seen many of the neighborhood dogs and cats, but NEVER this dog.  
  This dog was a Rottweiler, and it was HUGE. Imagine a Rotty, with all of the colors and markings, the docked tail and all, but the size of a Great Dane, or maybe a large Mastiff. Big, big, big dog - much, much bigger than a normal Rotty should be.
  I stopped, unsure of how this unknown dog may act, but he trotted right up to me. I slowly held out my hand, he sniffed, and his stump of a tail began to wag. He sat down, and I patted his head, calling him a good doggy, and wondering where his house was, and if he was lost, etc etc etc. He grinned up at me with a good dog grin, and just continued to enjoy getting pet. 

  Finally, I told him I had to get going home, and that he should go home too. (I have *always* talked to animals as if they know what I am saying. Just something I do, and wont ever change it.) I gave him a final pat on the head, and moved to go around him... and he got up, and continued walking right by my side, just like a good, trained dog would. I continued to pet him randomly, and was telling him he should go home, since his owners would be worried about him. 

  We approached the major street just as the yellow light was hitting. I stopped to wait, and the dog did too, sitting down. At this point, a car approached. It was swerving slightly.  This car, an old 70s-ish car from what I remember, brownish in color,  tan maybe.  Might have been a Concourse or a Nova - not really sure. As it passed, I could see it filled with occupants, and could hear loud music playing from the car speakers. Then the car stopped dead, in the middle of the road, and began to back up. 
  I was watching as it got closer, since something like this is never good to have happen late at night, with no one else around (gas station on the corner was closed). There were a bunch of guys in the car, and they had all started up a ruckus - hooting and hollering, with the usual bs that seemingly drunk guys will yell out at a girl, ""Hey baby"", ""Wanna party with us"", ""Dude, look at her""... then I heard ""Lets get her"", and the drivers side door started opening. 
  At this point, the dog, who had stayed by my side the entire time, stood up and began growling, barking and basically throwing a shit fit. The guy who had started getting out of the car paused, looked back in the car, shook his head then got right back in the car. I had knelt down beside the dog, kind of holding him back, and kind of just holding on to him for comfort - it was like having my own personal huge living teddy bear to hug, ya know? 
  The guys in the car took off, and I immediately crossed the street, streetlights be damned. The dog stayed right by me, but this time, seemed much more alert, ears forward, looking around. His side was brushing me as we walked. It was very comforting.

  When we got to my house, I opened the front gate, and let him in to our... kind of a porch area at that house. He went straight to the door, sniffed around, then proceeded to curl up right on the doorstep. I again told him to go home, pet him and then went inside. 
  When I went outside later, after waking up, the dog was gone. I was hoping he would have stayed, as he did not have a collar on or anything else that indicated who his owners might be. 

  I asked my dad later if he had seen the dog when he got up in the morning (my dad used to get up super, super early, so would have been up half an hour later, after I had gotten home that night). He said no he had not seen any dog, and could not remember ever seeing a dog of that size and description in the nieghborhood, ever. 

  Coincidence? Maybe. But it just seems very... convenient... for a dog of that size, with that demeanor, obviously well behaved, to have shown up at that exact moment, half a block and minutes away from when I encountered those jerks in the car. I just think.. what would have happened if that nice dog had not been there?

  Spirit animal? Spirit guardian? Physical karmic manifestation of all the animals I had (and continue) to take in, and care for? Who knows. All I know is that it was the right place and the right time for him to show up. Not scary (except for the guys in the car).. but reassuring in a way.

To this date it is one of the most bizarre ghost stories I have ever heard and I have never heard any ghost story like it before or since.

My mother told me that when she was little her family briefly lived in a converted barn type house.  She was only about 5 and her room was the uppermost room in the attic.  One day she was up there and found she could not exit the room.  It was like a forcefield was in the way at the doorway, she could not get through.  She screamed for help and her father rushed up along with the rest of the family.  They could not get in, as if a forcefield was in the way.  I don't know how long this continued, but she said that eventually her father 'tricked' the ghost by turning away and ushering the rest of the family away and said something along the lines of 'we can't do anything, lets leave' and then made the motion to begin walking, then suddenly whisked round, grabbed my mother and bolted down the stairs.

I know this will sound unbelievable and I don't know how she knew it was a ghost, perhaps there were other experiences up there.  My mother first told me this story when I was about 10 years old, and for the last 20 years she has told this story and no detail has been altered and she has remained adamant it is a true story for those 20 years.

If you don’t know where Athens, OH is, or why you should know, here is a link:  www.hauntedathensohio.com.  Also, I apologize for the length.  I am Appalachian so I don't know HOW to tell a short story.

 I didn’t even know my hometown was supposed to be haunted until ABC came to our little town for their Halloween series on the top 13 haunted places in the world.  The neighborhood where I grew up was normal… well, no.  It was exceptional.  There were about 12-20 kids there at all times with extremely overactive imaginations and a taste for adventure, so my childhood was more akin to “The Goonies” than “The Sandlot.”

We had a tight community that was the only sign of civilization out in the boonies.  On the west side of the neighborhood we were surrounded by “the field” and to the east was “the woods” north was “the ravine” and south was “the pond.”  Each of these places held their own adventures, but the real fun happened on snow days.
This is what wigs me out about my experience.  It didn’t happen in the dark, it didn’t happen when I was alone, and it didn’t happen at night.  It was during a snow day in 1996, and we’re talking about one of those massive, magical snow-weeks when your entire purpose in life is dedicated to creating the most treacherous, life-threatening sledding courses you can find.  Out of our four hot-spots we headed straight to the ravine, because it had the most Calvin-and-Hobbes-esque sledding potential.  I don’t know if anyone here has ever been to Southeastern Ohio, but we’re right on the edge of the Appalachian foothills, and our ravines are covered in oak and elm trees and pricker bushes.  But the hills were KICK ASS.

This was our last day out before the roads were finally going to be cleared, so we were all business.  We were going to get a full day of sledding in if it killed us (and it almost did… several times.  I am 28 years old and still afraid to tell my parents about some of the stupid crap we did).  

We had just exited the tree line into one of our neighbor’s yards after seven-hour sledding stint, bloodied but triumphant, when we heard this music.  I was the first to stop and listen.  It was this weird music box music, and I thought I was imagining it when I saw the other fifteen kids with me stop too.  We are talking k-6 kids, and every single one of us stopped talking at the same time.  The wind had been howling all day, and it stopped at the same time as the music began and there was just a little snow falling still.  It was coming from where we had just been behind the tree-line.  And it was definitely music box music.  It wasn’t any song that any of us recognized, either.  It also seemed to be moving and coming from different directions.  

Usually when faced with a mystery like this I would grab my Sherlock Holmes notebook (shut up) and look for clues with my k-12 posse.  This time, nobody moved or spoke for a very long time. As the oldest, a whopping twelve years old at the time, I decided to nut up and walk toward where the music seemed to be coming from.  Nobody else came with me and I wasn’t sure if I should freak out yet or not (you know how when little kids fall down and you see them sit there for a second and try to figure out if they should cry or not?  Like that.), so I kept going until I reached the trees.  I stood there for a moment trying to figure out where the sound was coming from.  The song wasn’t familiar, but it wasn’t exactly creepy either.  Then it stopped.  It was replaced with one of those thick silences that makes you run out of a room when you know damn well nothing is there.  You couldn’t hear the snow fall or any of the creaking branches (there had been an ice storm days before so all of the branches were coated in an inch of ice so every time the wind blew you could hear a whole lot of creaking.)  There was just nothing.  I turned around and all of my friends were huddled together looking at me like they were waiting for orders or something.  If I freaked out, they would freak out.  I was wary, but there wasn’t anything legitimately alarming about the situation, so I calmly made my way back to them so we could get some hot chocolate and watch Star Wars. 

Then I fell.  I probably tripped over a branch or something, but in four feet of snow when you go down, you stay down.  Then the wind kicked up in full force, way harder than it had been blowing before, and these javelin-esque ice-covered branches started falling point down from the trees into the ground all around me.  I’d been hit by those before, and I had no desire to be again so I kept trying to get up and I couldn’t.  The snow was swirling around me and I couldn’t see anything at all.  To make it even more terrifying the music box music started again and seemed to be swirling around in the wind.  I started hearing shouts from my friends and my little sister screaming bloody murder so I just shouted “RUN!” as loud as I could, got myself up, and ran toward them.  They had a good start on me (except for my little sister who apparently thought it was more productive to just stand there and scream), so I grabbed her and yanked her along with me.  The blizzard had started again and we ran until we hit our house.  You have no idea how terrifying it is to try and run in four feet of snow when you don’t even know what you are running from.  You get nowhere fast.

When we got home we were pretty quiet, so my mom questioned us about what happened.  Apparently it was a lot scarier from the other kid’s point of view.  From what they said it started to get dark around me and when the wind kicked up I disappeared completely behind a shadow and snow.  My mom chalked it up to the power of suggestion (which is legitimate.  A large group of dehydrated, exhausted kids with overactive imaginations or a music box monster:  What’s more likely?)
We talked about it for a little while, but for a bunch of kids that were frequently seeking out the unusual, we barely touched this one.  

Nobody even brought It up again until five years later when my little sister and her friend came screaming in from their walk in “the field”.  (This was the only flat land for miles, and it was about 1 mile by 1 mile in size with grass and weeds the size of a person that my dad had cut paths into for strolling).  We thought they were running from bugs or something, but their faces where WHITE.  I know some people say that for effect , but I’m serious.  Their faces were WHITE.  They said that they heard the music again and ran for it before the wind kicked up.  According to my sister, every time they ran the music would be in front of them, blocking their path.  I kind of blew it off because a funnel cloud was rolling in, and those things will scare the hell out of anybody.  There was a tornado that touched down three miles outside of us that evening, and when the storm cleared I turned on the computer because by that time it was 2002 and we had slightly-better-than-dial-up internet service.  That’s when I started looking up music boxes.  I researched for a good six hours before I found it.  I finally found the song that we had heard all those years ago.
Apparently it is called “Hatikva” which was a popular tune for music boxes back in the day:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQgt8cNEPck

The next morning I went out to “the field” to investigate.  There was a lot of rubbish from the tornado, but it was a really sunny, bright day.  I walked to the edge of our yard and looked into the field.  I wasn’t there for five minutes before I heard the music, but it sounded like it was coming from the far side of the field so I walked towards it, clearing weeds and fallen branches as I went.  I got about halfway through when I heard it stop.  I don’t know why, but I said, “I know that song.”   There was a healthy breeze going, and it stopped very suddenly like it had last time.  The music started up again, with this weird buzzing under it, except the buzzing was coming from behind me whereas the music was in front of me.  That’s when I realized it was a fallen bee’s nest.
I am extremely allergic to bees and I didn’t have my EpiPen on me.  So I had a choice to run through the bees or towards the creepy disembodied music.
I chose bees.  
Luckily the bees’ reaction was slightly delayed so they didn’t start chasing me until I was a good several yards ahead, but they were seriously pissed off for some reason. When they eventually gave chase I was stung twice and my mom had to jam the EpiPen into my leg when I finally reached home.  The bees continued to try to get into my house until the sun went down.  
I have no speculations as to what the hell it was or what was going on, but we had a buddy system after that.  I’m 100% skeptic, and still have no answers.  Has anyone ever had a similar experience?

She had a friend named Johnny who was suffering from CF or some other debilitating illness, who had recently been hospitalized as a result. Both she and her friend Shelly visited Johnny regularly in the hopes of keeping his spirits up and for a quick recovery. One night after visiting Johnny, they were at Shelly's when they decided to try out a ouija board. After a while, they started communicating with a spirit who seemed to know a lot about them that it really shouldn't. After some banal questions about boys and general questions one would expect teenaged girls to ask, my GF decided to ask about Johnny and his condition. The board quickly spelled out ""24 June 1987 Johnny wont have to worry anymore"" and went to ""goodbye"". My GF and Shelly were so convinced that board was giving them a date for recovery that they actually wrote the message down and sealed it in an envelope. The following year on 24 June, it turned out that Johnny indeed no longer needed to worry about his condition.

What follows is a short account of what occurred aver a span of about six months back when I was 18-19. From first experiencing the strange events to finishing our seances was about three months, and then three months following was when I suffered the worst side effects. Forgive the poor writing; most of my memories concerning this are foggy. When I think about it, I get emotional and typing a coherent story gets much harder. If anyone ever has had anything similar happen, please feel free to share your experiences. It would be nice to be able to converse with someone who experienced what I did over those months, to share that experience. It doesn't feel real a lot of the time. Yeah, all my friends who shared this with me remember it. But they do not like to talk about what happened. 

I still feel troubled concerning these events.

Had a friend with a supposedly haunted house. We would hang out and smoke there, and lights would turn on and off, cabinets would randomly open, just a bunch of small stuff. We decided to start messing with a Ouija board. 

Came into contact with three separate , lets just say ""entities"". One was a supposed 16 year old girl, one an older man named Dick, and a (for lack of a better word) demon who referred to itself as Zaza. The girl was supposedly raped and murdered by Dick who later killed himself. Both of these entities were supposedly suppressed by Zaza. This led to an increase in the strange activity, in frequency as well as the magnitude of occurrences. 

Objects would move when we left rooms, her dogs would bark and freak out at things we couldn't see, they wouldn't go into certain rooms, we heard sounds coming from empty rooms. It started with just three of us messing with the board. We invited several other people over over a period of about 2 months to bear witness to make sure we weren't just crazy. 

Things then started taking a turn for the worse. We would hear growling coming from her added on den. Uncomfortable sensations started plaguing us. We would experience extreme cold to the point where our breath would frost in a climate controlled house. We started having disturbing dreams and having trouble sleeping.

 At the apex of it all, we decided to perform a seance with myself acting as the medium. We had three separate seances calling out the each entity in turn. When we first called to the young girl, I started to become overcome with extreme sadness. I started crying for no reason. Sobbing uncontrollably. 

When we called to Dick, it was polar opposite. I blacked out for over half of this seance. I apparently started smashing my head on the table when someone turned on a light. I do remember uncontrollable bouts of maniacal laughter followed by dead silence staring at my female friend while being plagued by thoughts of doing horrible, murderous things to her. I don't think Dick cared for females. 

When we called to Zaza, the experience was similar to channeling Dick. During one of the periods I was blacked out, one of my friends asked if I could make the table move. I apparently raised my hands, started laughing like a crazy person, and the table started shaking without anyone touching it. They said they heard scratching on the underside of it and heard growling coming from nowhere during this time. 

There were many other odd things that happened during the seances that I cannot recall. While I did experience it all firsthand, that is not how I remember it. Some, like I said, I was completely lucid and remember clearly. Other times, I would black out, lose 5 minutes or so, then come to, almost like I passed out. And yet, there were times I felt like I was watching myself, almost like a movie, or a vivid dream. I was watching myself do things through a fog, but I had no control over it. 

But, to me, the most conclusive event occurred after the seance. 

It had been about ten minutes since we had finished. I had gone outside to smoke a cig and calm down a bit. We then regrouped at our seance table to try one more time a provoke a reaction. We actually weren't joined in our seance circle at this time. I was challenging whatever was there to knock me down, do something, anything, to prove itself. I was standing approximately 5 feet away from a large, heavy dining room table set on a heavy rug. No one was close enough to be able to move it. The table slid the whole distance and hit me hard enough to knock me back, almost knocking me down. We tried moving it ourselves later, and it took a considerable amount of effort to slide it that distance. After that, we were done. 

My friendship with the homeowner quickly died out. I run into her occasionally and we chit chat but that's about it. For a year or so after, I had a lot of sleeping problems. Falling asleep, staying asleep, etc. I would have to exhaust myself by staying up for 18+ hours, working, and smoking a lot of pot just to be able to fall asleep for maybe 5 hours. And even then, I had really awful nightmares. 

Tl;dr: Ouija board, seance, possesion.

My friend snapped this pic in between seances. Said he saw something in it. I never can see what he is talking about. Sorry for shitty quality. Its a cell pic from a potato 4 years ago.

---------------------------------------------

Two years ago, I moved into an apartment with my best friend from high school, her boyfriend, and their newborn to help out with bills and keeping the place tidy. I'd known the dad for about a year, now, and he was a fairly interesting guy. He fancied himself a demonologist and capable of dealing with them, banishing them, communicating, et all. I was inclined to believe him after I was at his old house during a banishing ceremony he and a roommate performed to cleanse the house of some shit an ex-roommate brought in when they moved out. After the concluded the ritual, the icerink next door to their house exploded, with police investigations finding no sign of breaking and entering, arson, anything.

Anyways, I moved in with reservations, but it was my best friend and their kid was the cutest damn thing. I was working graveyard at IHOP when I moved in, so they'd still be asleep when I would get home in the morning. A few weeks in, I came home to a bunch of artwork tacked to my walls. I inquired about it, and the dad (let's call him Jason) said it was his artwork of demons he's encountered. One in particular made me really uncomfortable - it was a black and white striped snake with one really large eye and one arm that had a hand balled into a fist. It just creeped me out.

I would take the picture down and have it returned up in the same spot a few days later, I'd hide it and it's be on my bed - all that generally weird shit.

A few months in, the couple was out on a date and I babysat the kid. I'd put him down to rest after a particularly gassy night and moved the baby monitor into my room so I could keep an eye on him while doing homework. I unpin the picture of the snake, turn it around, and jab the thumbtack back in its place.

Around 11:45 (my roommates were due back at 11), I hear the front door unlock, open, and slam shut. I yell a sarcastic welcome with no response. Footsteps into their room and into the closet-turned-baby room. Over the baby monitor I hear a raspy breathing, the kid fussing, and the device goes dead. From the hallway I hear a thud and the baby starts screaming his head off. I run into his room to see him on the ground next to his crib with welts across his face. I pick him up and hear something in the kitchen.

As I walk from one end of the apartment to the other, I notice that every light is on, every electronic device is going crazy, and all the faucets are turned on. I hear feedback on both baby monitors and a low gurgle. I turn off the faucets in the bathroom and kitchen, ending at the front door which is still locked it the deadbolt and chain still in place. At this point, the kid starts fussing and squirming, and I notice the blinds to the balcony are rustling. I lock us in my room, grab my rosary, and call my roommates, panicking. As I was explaining the situation to them and demanding they come home, I notice that fucking picture is on my bed, facing me.

I moved out the next day.

1363243471.0,40,self.Thetruthishere,1a9slq,[FAM]: Grandma shares a weird story from her past that relates to me in some way,G-zazz,51,11,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1a9slq/fam_grandma_shares_a_weird_story_from_her_past/,"Someone encouraged me to repost this from Nosleep! It's completely true and is freaking me out a little bit.

So this is a story that my grandmother told me. Some facts you should know before you read this is that my mom and her side of the family is from Chechnya, which is in the part of Russia that's right by the Caucasus mountains. It's very crime ridden and they have a lot of old-fashioned values concerning crimes. For example, if you kill somebody, it's only fair that a person from your family, or yourself would be killed in return (and that's if the person is generous enough to only kill one person rather than your entire family).

My mom told me a story last night that I posted on /r/LetsNotMeet[1] and then proceeded to tell my grandmother to tell me more stories about the things that happened to them in Russia. My grandmother decided to tell me a story that has unnerved all of them to this day.

When my grandmother was a teenager, her mother passed away and her father sent her and her little sister to live with their aunt and uncle. Within a week of their stay, my grandmother's uncle decided to brighten their moods by taking them to visit some friends.

The people they were friends with were incredibly interesting, quirky to say the least. One woman in particular caught my grandmother's eye and she and her family quickly moved to sit around the woman and chat. It's a custom where my family is from to exchange gifts whenever visiting, despite everyone being less than well off financially. This woman in particular lived with almost nothing to her name and was incredibly grateful to my grandmother and her family for the gifts given to her.

""While I have nothing physical to give you"" the woman said, ""I have something important that you should know. Two people will come to your house today while you are at home. They aren't invited guests, mind you, but they will come with the intent to take from you. This will be hard to hear, but you have to let them take whatever they want without any trouble. Let them leave. You will be thankful in the future.""

My grandma's uncle laughed and replied jokingly if he should offer his apartment all together to get the ordeal over with and the woman smiled in return, exchanging in some playful retorts before the family had to leave. They were only in their apartment for about 3 hours before their door was slammed open and two men entered with the intent to rob their house.

Before they began to take anything, they noticed my grandmother, her sister and her uncle in the living room and began to retreat back until my grandma's uncle stood up:

""Please take what you like"" he smiled ""No hard feelings, we'll be here reading if you need anything"". I kid you not, those were his exact words. My grandma remembers them clear as day as the thought of letting burglars in without a single objection was absolutely bizarre.

The men took what they wanted, some jewelry, some money, a stray blanket and some food and left quietly and gratefully.

One month later, my grandma's uncle grew ill. It was curable, a flu of some sort, perhaps a stomach virus, but it was something that was best treated by professionals, meaning they needed a doctor. 

Unfortunately, the closest hospital was an hour away and the weather outside was dreadful. They had a car but it was anything but useful and it malfunctioned on most days, but it was all they had. As they were driving to the hospital, the car (of course) managed to stutter to a halt, leaving my grandma, her sister, her aunt, and her severely ill uncle stranded inside. My grandma was determined to continue onward and decided to run off the road to ask for assistance.

As she trekked through the cold, she noticed a tavern and rushed inside, only to come across a group of rowdy men and women laughing and singing and sharing drinks. When she asked who they all were, she discovered that this tavern held only thieves. Literally. They all stole from people and resided here with their loot. I kid you not. 

This was actually a thing in 1950's Russia. Much to my grandma's surprise, two men began approaching her, and she recognized them as the men who robbed their apartment just a month ago. When they said their greetings and offered her some food, she told them the situation and, once again to her surprise, they stated that they had a car and would gladly drive her uncle and aunt to the hospital while her and her sister remained at the tavern to warm up and relax.
These men stayed true to their word and my grandmother's uncle returned safely with her aunt back to the tavern where they befriended the two men that helped them and invited them over formally whenever they had the chance to visit.

it was many years later that my grandma came across the woman who predicted these circumstances. She was old, on the verge of death, but remembered my grandmother almost immediately. Upon meeting her, they hugged and kissed and my grandma once again gave her a gift (probably some poetry books and my grandma's cake because my grandma makes the greatest cake known to mankind). 

Once again, the woman had nothing of monetary value to give my grandmother and she asked if her words would suffice again. My grandmother agreed and sat to listen to the woman who indirectly saved her uncle many years ago.

""Your entire family will be filled with success, your husband will thrive financially, your children will all succeed in their chosen careers, your daughter especially will be incredibly successful and lead you to a new place to live.

It is there she will give birth to two daughters, the eldest will be athletic, artistic, with a voice given by God, the youngest will be intelligent beyond her years. Both will have their names become well known, but for very different reasons.

Before she dies, you must tell the eldest daughter that I am sorry.""
Now that my grandma told me this information, let me tell you why I am freaking the fuck out.

1) My grandpa was simply a math teacher for a very long time before become a Dean in a very well known Russian university.

2) My grandma had three children, my mom, and my two uncles, all of whom became very successful at their chosen career.

3) My mom's residency in America was one of the reasons my grandma and her family left Russia (another reason being sort of political, but that's another story)

4) My mom did give birth to two daughters, myself being the eldest and then my little sister.

I sang at a professional establishment in New York for a few years before quitting, and within four years I ended up becoming a nationally ranked athlete. (On a separate note, i don't really find my voice to be that amazing as the woman described, I think the only reason she said it was 'God-given' was because nobody in either side of my family is particularly good at singing which means it wasn't really an inherited trait). My sister ended up getting accepted to a bunch of private middle schools and is all around really successful academically, at least compared to myself, and i'm sort of a B average student. But seriously, she's really smart.

Now, the one thing that worries me is the very last part. I mean I know I'm going to die, that's obvious. Everyone dies. However, the woman stated that my grandma should tell me that the woman's sorry before I die, meaning that my grandma will still be alive by the time of my death. Another sort of hint that I thought of was the fact that both of our names are going to be known for very different reasons. I mean I'm pretty well known in the athletic circuit, and my sister seems like the type to be pretty famous when it comes to the more academic stuff...but the last sentence makes me think that I might be more well known due to my demise...Meaning that I'm probably going to die pretty young in a pretty awful way I'm assuming.

My grandma didn't want to tell me all of this, mind you. She just wanted to tell me the story of the predicted robbery, but I managed to get her to tell me this story after everyone went to bed. She's worried that the ending will kind of mess me up emotionally and she doesn't want me getting distracted by anything since I got recruited by a university that will only keep me if I maintain my grades. Obviously I'm still going to focus on my grades, but I just need to figure out what this woman meant.

I think they are very unexplainable and eerie, so I thought I would share them with this subreddit.  

I am not looking for explanations, but speculations/discussions are sure welcome!

This first story involves my Grandma Mary in pre-WW2 rural Iowa. She was married and childless at the time.  

**STORY ONE:**
Mary was very close with her husband Charles' sister, Jean.  Jean was also married with children but was a bit troubled.  She was flighty and suffering major depression, which went undiagnosed because of the era.
One day, Jean suddenly went missing and Charles left to go search for her, leaving Mary home alone.

When Mary was in the kitchen that night, she got a knock on her door.  She opened it, and Jean was standing there in a satin pink robe.  Mary said, ""Well Jean!  What are you doing here?  Everyone is looking for you!  Come in and have some coffee with me?""

And then she turns to lead Jean into the house and looks behind her, and Jean had disappeared.

An hour or so later, Charles calls Mary and tells her that they had found Jean.  It turns out she had taken some pills and crawled into an air duct in their laundry room and had died.  She was found wearing a pink robe.




**STORY TWO:**
My mother and Grandma Mary are Catholic.  (READ: Very superstitious).  In conversation one day, my mother requested of Mary that when she passed, she would agree to contact my mom from the other side.

When Mary died, my mother was unable to be there when she passed.  She had been staying at Mary's apartment and sleeping in her bed.  That night, she was awoken by a series of loud knocks on the apartment door.  My mom swears they had to be real because she was awoken from a deep sleep, and then compelled to go to the door to check if there was anyone there.

My mother also recalls not knowing this before, but a superstitious friend telling her that to hear knocks after some one has died communicates safe passage.  

(Can anyone elaborate on that?  What do you know about knocking superstition?)




**STORY THREE:**
About a year after Mary's passing, my mother, me, and older brother Jake are at home.  We're both 1-2 years old at the time.  My brother is in the kitchen playing quietly and my mom leaves the room for a bit, possibly outside or down to the basement or to take a shower.  

When she re-enters the kitchen, she finds a wooden chair pushed up against the wall and the corded telephone hung upside-down in the jack.  She says, ""Jake, did some one call?""
Jake: ""Yes.""
Mom: ""Who was it.?""
Jake: ""Grandma Mary""
And my Mom's heart stops, ""What did she say?""
Jake:  ""Are you being a good boy?""

And I'm not sure what he said, or if there was anything else said.  There was no other person/friend named Mary who would have called and talked to him.




**STORY FOUR:**
When I was four, I was in and out of the hospital for kidney problems.  One time, my mom was in my room and saw me holding my hand up in the air, like if some one was kissing my hand or something.  She laughs at me and asks me what I am doing.  I tell her that ""Grandma Mary is holding my hand.""

It's a bit long, so bear with me.

The summer between 8th and 9th grade (so I think 2002?), my dad was sent to Okinawa, Japan to cover for someone who'd been transferred to Afghanistan (military planning, why move one person when we can move like 4 or 5 to cover each other by doing the exact same job?). He was there for about 6 months, and my mom, sister, and I went out to visit him for about 2 of those.

The house we were staying in belonged to the guy who my dad was covering, as when he left, his wife and kids left to head stateside and stay with her family. It was on base, I believe Marine, and was a very plain, converted concrete Japanese bunker they'd made into a two-story home after the war, slightly elevated to avoid flood water in monsoon season, with fairly small windows.

There were only two bedrooms: the parents, and the kids. The kids had a king sized bed that they shared, and the parents had a queen, so naturally our parents swiped the kids room, and my sister and I shared the smaller bed. The queen bed was ungodly lumpy and hard, it was literally like they'd stuffed a giant pillow case with sloppily folded t-shirts. After the first night, my sister and I decided against staying in there, and opted to just sleep downstairs on the living room couches.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/xcDDD.jpg) is the layout of the room. There were only 3 possible light sources at night: the TV, the computer, and the window. The kitchen door was closed at night, and the hallway/front door and the large back wall had no windows.

The first night down there, my sister slept on the couch (as she's older and I curl up when I sleep anyway), and I took the loveseat. I kept hearing my mom walking down the hallway in her slippers to check on us, and it got really annoying, but I pretended I was asleep so she wouldn't start talking to me. On one particular occasion, she stood there for a really long time, so I peeked open one eye, but couldn't see her unless I got up, and I wasn't willing to risk a conversation at shit o'clock in the morning. I did notice the shadows along the wall with the window though. 

They were moving quickly, like when a car drives past at night, and the shadow shifts with the headlights. I didn't think much of it at first, until I realized that there were no cars driving by, because I would've been able to hear them. I sat up and put my glasses on, and that's when I realized a couple of things.

1) The wall they were on was not a part of the wall that should have shadows. One light source would make shadows on the wall exactly opposite, one would've done it on the wall to my left, and the other would've done it on the wall to my right. Nothing was shining on *that* wall though.

2) They were silhouettes of people. With helmets and bayoneted rifles. 

3) My mom didn't bring her slippers on this trip, and I never heard the footsteps on the stairs, just in the hallway.

I had no idea what to do, so I did the first thing my body decided to do on its own.

I laid down, rolled over, and tried desperately to pretend I hadn't realized any of that. Didn't sleep a wink.

The next morning, my sister looked just as bleary and exhausted as I did. After breakfast, she suddenly suggested we sleep upstairs from then on. I readily agreed, then thought to ask why. Turns out she'd seen and heard everything I had. Neither of us had wanted to freak the other out, so we kept it to ourselves and didn't wake the other up.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_xaz1q,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/xaz1q/me_my_second_night_in_okinawa/,

Picking up where I had left off I had just witnessed something that would later develop into a life of co-existing with the paranormal. My mother always claimed that she, my Nana, my brother and I are what she called “sensitives.” We can sense things, see things, hear things that other people in my family either can’t or just tune out. My mother personally thinks my house is a portal of sorts, because we never see the same thing twice. She thinks that it is in all places my back room closet, which always had a weird vibe to it. But, I think it comes from the attic and lingers in the hallway. We all hate the hallway. 

There was a time when we first moved in that my mother insisted that we sleep with our doors open. The air gets stale when the doors are constantly kept closed. We would get awoken in the middle of the night by weird noises, footsteps coming from the attic. I always chalked that up to the house being old. I started sleeping with my door shut which would irk my mother. When I did close the in my old room it would open randomly in the middle of the night. That would be startling but the door never securely closed and open by the slightest breeze. However, my mother wouldn’t fight with me about having my door closed after one night. She would hear stuff at night too, but we could live with that. Yet, this one night she awoke lying on her side to a face staring at her not even 6 inches from her. She rolled over and ignored it. Ever since that night she insisted that we sleep with the doors closed. She believes that the open doors invite them into our rooms at night. After shutting the doors at night not much happens other than hearing people walk past your door at night. At least they are courteous enough to appreciate our privacy. 

The next occurrence I remember was when my brother was about 6 years old. He constantly complained about this pirate that would bother him at night. We thought he was having a bad dream or something. I don’t know why he chose to describe it as a pirate. I am assuming it was because the apparition had a hat. Well, one night I guess it was just really bothering him to the point that he needed to go and wake my mother up. She walked him back to his room and said “You are not welcome here, you need to leave,” followed by a prayer. They then went down to our living room to watch some TV, but really what is on at 3am? My mom said that after being down on the couch for less than 10 minutes there was this light out of his room. They both described it as a bright light that aluminate from his bedroom and moved into the hallway, but the light didn’t cast down the stairs it just stayed in the hallway. Moments later the light just faded, rather disappeared. My mom told the confused 6 year-old that it was just the flashlight from a paperboy. What are you to tell a kid? 

Fast forward a few uneventful years my mother had a difficult time sleeping one night. She often found comfort in the downstairs recliners. The one she laid her head in that night happened to face the base of the stairwell. Well she awoke in the middle of the night to once again find something staring at her. They weren’t so aggressive this time. They stood at the base of the stairwell and watched her as she slept. She described them as an Amish couple. She hoped if she closed her eyes and ignored them they would go away, but they didn’t. Today, she thinks that they are her guardian angels. A few days after seeing them my mother got into a big wheel accident and dislocated her shoulder. No, she wasn’t driving one. She ran a daycare (mentioned in my last post) and as she was going through the back door into the yard one of the kids she cared for pretty much ran her over with one, causing her to hit the concrete patio and dislocate her shoulder. She thinks they were trying to give her a warning. Which I believe because it happened to me with the shadow man I mentioned in the first post. I don’t think mentioned this but a few days after seeing him I took my skooter out for a ride (without a helmet because helmets are for losers) and scraped my face up pretty bad. My classmates called me Freddy Kruger for a while to give you an idea of what it looked like. It seemed like whenever something bad was about to happen we saw something. 

Next thing I remember that was really strange and I have no explanation for happened when I was 15. Here's a [layout](http://imgur.com/SGr7B,dfJOl,ro9Tc#0) to help. I was bedridden after a surgery that required me to have nurses visit me daily for 3 months. What a way to spend a summer vacation. Well for the first month or so I wasn’t able to walk on my own and relied a lot on my mother and the banister in my hallway to commute from my bedroom to my bathroom. Well one time my mother left me leaning on the banister while she ran into the bathroom quick to grab something. Where I stood there was a lighting fixture (yellow circle in the picture) directly above me. From years of vibration of doors slamming the thing must have come loose. Now, if my understanding of gravity and physics is correct the fixture should have fallen pretty much straight down and hit me on the head. Instead, it happened to fly almost 4 feet down the hall and crash right in front of my bedroom door (which is My Brother's room in the picture), shattering into pieces. I still have no rhyme or reason why or how that could have happened. Funny thing is that we put up a new fixture and it fell down again. We haven’t put up a new one since. 
After that incidence I moved from my old room to my new room. I like this room despite the stuff my brother saw in here. At least the door won’t swing open on me anymore. Whenever there was any wind the door would slam shut. Occasionally the door would pop open if it wasn’t securely shut and someone walked passed it. By popping open I mean maybe an inch if that. Well one night I was awoken in the middle of the night by my door being swung wide open and hard enough that it hit the wall and bounced back. I hurried out of bed, closed the door, and said the same thing my mother would say. “You aren’t welcome here, you need to leave.” That always seemed to work for whatever reason. 

Things were pretty quiet for the last few years until just recently. I would say the past year or so. One night I was in my room working on some calculus problems when I hear a soft knock at the door. 
Knock, knock, knock “Tina.” 
“Yes? Come in.”
No answer. I thought it must have been my imagination.  A few moments later:
Knock, knock, knock “Tina.”
“Yes, what? Come in.”
Again, there was no answer. Okay, I must be losing it. Maybe I’m just too tired and hearing things. I swear I heard it though. Well if it happens one more time I’m going to see who it is. A few moments later:
Knock, knock, knock “Tina.”
This time I swing the door open to nothing. I call to my parents and ask if they had been calling for me, and of course they haven’t. All I know is that I probably shouldn’t have told it to come in or opened the door to it because that night was out of the ordinary. I went to my back room and hear someone breathing in my ear. Later that night, I awoke from the sound of something coming from my back room. I use to have a bamboo curtain that covered the doorway (I have since taken it down because of this experience).  I am use to the house making noises. It’s old and it creaks. The bamboo beads would also gently clang together with the air flow. The sound is kind of soothing really. Now there is a difference in sound between the beads just hitting each other from the draft in the room and someone physically walking through it. It was more, well, noisy and violent. I then heard the floorboards creek. If that wasn’t bad enough I felt the being sit on my bed and touch my leg though the blanket. It was there for a few minutes before I felt it get back up and heard it walk into the back room again.

The last thing that happened in my room was so mind boggling. I’ve tried debunking it and have come up empty handed. My daily routine at the time was to get up, go on the laptop for an hour, then get ready for work. Well I woke up and went to grab my laptop. That night I had left a glass of water sitting on top of a book. So I took my laptop downstairs and an hour passes by so it’s time to get ready for work. I head back upstairs to my room to put my laptop back on the desk. Now [this](http://imgur.com/SGr7B,dfJOl,ro9Tc#1) is what was on my desk when I went downstairs, and [this](http://imgur.com/SGr7B,dfJOl,ro9Tc#2) is what I returned to. This blows my mind. I mean I was able to get the glass to lean like that but it takes a bit to make it balance like so. There is NO way that I bumped it by chance and it landed that way. Let alone for the water to form like that. My parents said my brother was playing a prank on me, but he was still asleep at the time and I was the only other one home. I tried dumping water on my desk and I cannot get it to do that. It’s just not humanly possible.

More recently we have been having things occurring in our kitchen which is directly below my bedroom. We have done some renovation and I know that can stir up things. While we were renovating, my mother and I were emptying out the cabinets. We open the one drawer and it literally said the word “no.” We looked at each other as if to say “did you just hear that?” We tried seeing if the drawer just was squeaky and our minds were playing a trick on us. It wouldn’t do anything. That was just strange. In the past months more stuff has started happening in that room.

 One afternoon I came home after classes and sat down to have lunch. My brother was home as well. As I was sitting there a noise caught my attention. It was faint at first but became more defined. It was scratching. It sounded like something scratching the inside one of the kitchen cabinets. My first thought is “oh my god, we have a rat.” I am so fearful of rodents. So firstly I call my boyfriend and tell him to come over immediately. While I’m on the phone I call my brother out into the kitchen. I wanted to make sure I wasn’t just hearing things. He came in and I questioned him about it. He looked shocked and said “You hear it too? I’ve been hearing this for weeks.” That scared me. He told me he’s been hearing it in the walls too. I assure him it has to be a rat or a squirrel or something. I call my dad and ask him to check it out when he got home. The sound was so real that we put boxes against the cabinet doors to prevent this thing from getting out. By that time the doors were shaking and I was getting freaked that something was going to run out at me. When my boyfriend got there I waited for him in the kitchen. The moment he stepped into the kitchen it stopped. Now I was annoyed. Whatever this was, it was making me look like I was crazy. Thank god my brother heard it too otherwise I would have thought the same thing. My boyfriend left the room and the moment he did it started up again. But now it was in a different cabinet on the other side of the room. These cabinets are solid wood and are not connected to each other. In order for this thing to move like that it would have had to of chewed through about 2 inches of wood, per cabinet. I call my boyfriend back into the room. It stops again. Now it’s just playing games with me. I was begging for him to believe me when it started up again for a moment and ended just as quickly. He heard it because as he was talking to me he perked his head up and was looking in the direction of noise. My dad got home and went through every cabinet and found no signs of anything. No scratch marks, no holes, no droppings, and nothing inside the cabinets were disturbed. It’s just something else that I can’t explain. It was just the other day that my mother heard something coming from the closet in the kitchen and she called for my father. The moment he walked into the room it stopped.

I think this is enough for now. Feel free to debunk. I am sorry that the pictures provided aren't all that great. These things happened years ago and I have no real photos to support my claims. I will put other experiences that my family and I have had in another post. Hope you enjoy my little rant. If you have any explanations for anything I'm happy to listen.

Some of the stories here are really incredible and I'm interested in adapting them. I would of course ask the writers for permission. Before I take this on, I just wanted to gauge the writers and readers here and the other subreddits listed to the right if it would be something of interest.

This is an idea I've been kicking around in my head for some time. The films would be professionally shot with professional actors. Stories would be adapted, with the author's permission, for a more visual medium.

I would love to know your thoughts! Thanks!

edit: Wow! This is a popular idea. Okay, I will have a new subreddit set up shortly and YouTube channel. I've already started to talk with authors and will be reaching out to more as the night/weekend goes on. I'm doing a lot of catch-up reading at the moment. Thank you everyone for your comments!

Update: I've created the subreddit r/nosleepseries as the subreddit, which could use some CSS love if anyone wants to help with that. The YouTube Channel will be [here](http://www.youtube.com/nosleepseries).

We think my stepdad haunts our house.",,44,5,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/mfuw5/mefam_posted_this_in_rparanormal_updating_a/,"I'm pretty skeptic, but strange things have been happening fairly often since he died.  I'd like any sort of rationalization or explanation, if you can think of any.

* My stepdad died about 1.5 years ago. When he died, all the lights in the room he died in died/burst. We've been seeing a lot of dragonflies since then. (He had no real liking or anything to do with dragonflies.) 

* A few months after my stepdad died, I had a dream that I was in the room above the garage (now my sister/nephews apartment) and that my stepdad came through the back door wearing his usual attire (bright yellow shirt, baseball cap). I dreamed my stepbrother was on the couch in the living room (which you can see from the stairs leading to the room I was in), catching him come in and looked as startled as the rest of us. Stepdad walked in the back door and said ""Hey, where have you guys been?"" My mom relayed to me that she had this same dream, from a different angle (her room, where you can also see the living room), before I told her about my dream.

* My mom started dating around 5 months ago, and one of her dates threatened to kill himself one night (nothing to do with her, just stuff happening in his life). That night, all the fire alarms went off in the house.  My mom woke up about 3 minutes before all this happened to my cat howling and pots and glasses clanking in the kitchen. We have a pot rack and a glass rack so its like they were moved by something in the kitchen.  This happened several nights and several other times when each of us (mom, sister, me) have been home alone. 

* I also live with a two year old, my nephew, who will stare up the stairs and say ""Pa (what he called my stepdad) is here,"" or sometimes he will say ""Someone is here.""  One day, my mom was in her room and my sister (his mother) was watching him and went upstairs to get laundry and found him locked outside. She questioned my mom about it, who hadn't moved from her spot. All of the doors in the house were deadbolted and my nephew was out on the front sidewalk.

* Recently, we have heard people walking up and down the stairs repeatedly, to the point where we can't sleep. It sounds like someone is stomping up the stairs. From where I'm from, on the second floor, it sounds like someone is starting from the bottom of the stairs and ending up on the landing in front of my room, then back down again. We also hear doors opening and sometimes closing randomly.

* A couple weeks ago, my mom sold a lot of my stepdad's things, including his catering equipment, which he was very fond of. The guy buying the equipment was freaked out because there were (I guess) over 100 dragonflies circling the area.  It was pretty amazing to see.

* Doors have started opening and slamming randomly.  Most notably in my room.  I've been woken by my bathroom door slamming shut in the middle of the night.  A few weeks ago, I was sleeping (really late, like 3pm) and my door to my room slammed open into the wall.  I thought it was my nephew, but no one was home but me and the cats were outside.  

* Our kitchen and living room are attached, and one day my sister and I heard the garbage disposal turn on.  Went to turn it off, and it turned back on.   TVs and stereo systems turn on minutes after being turned off.

Now, my mom has always thought she was ""psychic"" - bad feelings when bad things happen.  Most notably she thought a bird got into the house (a bad sign) but my dog at the time didn't acknowledge it.  She chased it out with a broom, and called to ask me and my sister if things were okay with us.  Got a call later that night that our housekeeper had committed suicide.  

My stepdad was sick for awhile with a liver disease, but died suddenly a long time before expected.  Because of his sickness, he couldn't sleep and would do things around the house in the middle of the night.  For instance, we think he is on/around the stairs because one night he pulled up all the carpet on the stairs intending to recarpet them, but died before it was completed.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I'd like your opinion.

1375551337.0,39,self.Thetruthishere,1jmvbb,[ME]My rehab experience,bassrose,51,12,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1jmvbb/memy_rehab_experience/,"I just want to start off my saying this is my first post to reddit! I love reading all the stories on here (and now sleep with a nightlight, thanks). I've dealt with a fair share of the paranormal but I'll just start off with my experiences in rehab.

Now, this rehab had been around for years. It had currently been a hospital, old folks home and another rehab. I went here in January of 2012 to turn my life around. The first night I was nervous and a bit scared. All throughout the night I heard whispers and other strange noises but just wrote it off as nerves. When I first arrived, there was just one other girl, who I'll call Rachel and maybe 3 guys. The first week passed without major incident, and another girl arrived, who I'll call Julie, who became my first roommate. 

We started hearing loud bangs on the walls at night. Not just normal sounds a old building would make, the sound of someone literally pounding their palms against the wall as hard as they could. Julie and I accused Rachel of doing it, and one night when it got particularly bad attempted to catch her in the act. We probably gave her the scare of her life busting through her door like a couple of cops, expecting to see her screwing around with us. She was the opposite side of the room from our shared wall, changing and obviously not banging on any walls. 

Then stuff started moving. It got to the point where we would make sure all the doors (which where solid and heavy and would NOT move on their own) where firmly close and would note where everything in the room was. Without fail, whenever we would return, doors and drawers would be opened, and stuff would be moved around even though there was absolutely no way anyone had been in our room. It was around this time we would start to see things move. While we were in our room, the blinds would start being moved up and down and generally look like a hand was swiping against them, the doors would slam, the drawers would open and close by themselves, and the pounding continued. One really bad night, in my closet we heard the sound of hangers hitting each other, the wall and being slid across the shelf. The next morning when I opened it, my clothes were in a heap on the ground and the hangers were scattered. 

The pictures in our room (basically motivational pictures on the walls of all the rooms) started being turned upside down. One day when Julie and I were sitting in the girls group room (which shared a wall with our bedroom) while Rachel was with her counselor. All of a sudden we could hear, clear as day, a piano playing and about 3 voices laughing and talking coming from our room. In this rehab, absolutely NO MP3 players or phones were allowed, and the RA on our floor wasn't playing any music. We walked to our room, and I swear, the moment we swung our door opened the music and voices just stopped. 

In this week we gained a few more girls, and gained a new roommate, Sabrina. We tried to use a Ouija board (I know, stupid of us) and this is when everything escalated. We turned off all the lights and started. Instantly, a cold rush went through the room, and a loud whisper we couldn't understand came from directly behind us. We instantly NOPE'D out and an RA confiscated our homemade board. 

One day, I was standing in our shared bathroom, and could clearly see Sabrina and Julie standing on the other side of the room, when the door slammed closed, with a huge force that shook the walls. Thankfully nothing happened to me but it was still a scare. One day during cleaning day, we split up our cleaning tasks and I went to go fill up the mop bucket in the handicapped room's bathroom. This room had its own fair share of creepy experiences, the two girls in the there actually saw their clothes (this room had no closet door) swinging in perfect synch one night when hanging up, along with other things similar to mine and Julie's experiences. When I walked in, the open closet was on my right and I could clearly see a person standing there, facing the shelf. I didn't pay any attention to it, assuming it was one of the girls but it annoyed me because both of them were supposed to be in the group room, cleaning in there. They weren't there whenever I walked into the room, and I went into the group room to see what they had been doing. Both of the girls got wide eyes, saying neither of them had been in their room all night.

Around this time, several times a day for absolutely no explainable reason, large hand imprints started appearing on my neck at random times. I wasn't rubbing or touching my neck and made a conscious effort not to do so. This imprints would stay for a few minutes, then disappear. I got other random marks on my arms and back.

At this point we all got scared. One night 2 out of the 3 rooms somehow got a strange mark on the wall that was clear and had not been there before. The imprint was a demon's face, a human head with a sharp chin, and horns. My counselor (even though this was completely against the rooms) confided that she believed something was here and that I should tell it to go away. The next day the banging again, more than before, and my door slammed shut. My nightstand next to my head began violently shaking, and fed up, I yelled at it to go away. It all stopped and everything was quiet for about a minute, then from the other side of the hall, on the boy's side, I heard screaming. I rushed out to see two of the boys, Daniel and Greg, standing outside of their room in panic.

Apparently while they were both in bed, a pencil that had been on the nightstand suddenly shot up, burying itself in the ceiling. Both of the boys (one who was involved in the weapon trade of one of the notorious gangs in our area and the country, the other a formerly #1 heavy lifting champ in our state, a no-nonsense country boy, definitely not what you would consider cowards) were so scared they refused to sleep in that room and demanded they were moved someplace else. They had been hearing and seeing other things and this was on the straw that broke the camel's back. Even when a RA from another unit began teasing them, they didn't budge. After that, the boys side began experiencing more activity, probably because I wasn't taking anymore shit from the paranormal side.

Only one more thing happened before I was discharged and it still gives me goosebumps to this day. Though the banging and stuff moving still happened, it wasn't as much. The whispers, hand prints completely stopped. I had changed rooms at one point with a girl named Tonya (just because of stupid drama). One night, at probably around 4am I woke up for no reason. I was in the bed closest to our doors and Tonya slept on the bed on the other side of the room, next to the window. Clear as day, I saw a tall, dark man next to the closet across from her bed, just standing. As I watched, he slowly walked to Tonya's bed, and stood over her, watching as she slept. Fed up at this point, I just rolled over and went to back to sleep. The next morning we went to breakfast and I just wrote it off as seeing stuff. Keep in mind I hadn't told ANY of the other girls what I had seen.

We're just chatting and out of no where, Tonya goes, ""I had the weirdest dream last night."" We ask her about it, and she says, ""well, I dreamed that a shadowy man was standing over my bed, watching me."" At this point my stomach dropped and I told her what I had seen. We both described the man the exact same. About 6'0, unclear facial features, broad and wearing some sort of suit. 

I was finally discharged from that place just a day or two earlier and I've never felt as much relief as I did when I stepped out of that place. For all that it helped me, I never could shake the feeling of being watched. Something EVIL is in that place. Actually, if there's interest in this at all, one night a terrifying chain of events happened before I was there that makes what I experienced a walk in the roses. I was told things I shouldn't have by my counselor and she confirmed that it did happen, but I'll save that story for another time because I feel this post has gotten way to long already! 

Thanks for reading and keep the stories coming! I didn't plan on sleeping tonight anyways. ;)",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1jmvbb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1jmvbb/memy_rehab_experience/,

Being 15 we where being loud, saying perverted stuff, and using language my parents would not enjoy.

 In the middle of this I began to think I was hearing foot step and cupboards shutting. My friend also thought he heard something so I went up stairs to investigate sense my parents were not to be home for a while. Once I reached the upstairs I yelled out ""Maaooom???"" ""Daaaaad???"" nothing. I checked the garage, their car was still gone. Thinking maybe it was just the house creaking, or maybe I was just hearing things that where not there, we went back to our game.

 Our activities would pause and we look at each other as we would think we where hearing things again, until finally during a brief pause in our chaotic pool game, we heard the familiar and definite sound of one of the cupboards slamming shut. This time we both went upstairs, checked the garage again, yelled out mom, and dad again, and still nothing. 

We both at that point did the ""are you messing with me?"" thing running through the possibility's it was one of our friends trying to freak us out. As we are hypothesizing on who it could be we begin to search the area. We went out into garage, opened the garage and, shutting the door behind us we circled the house. Still nothing. Things get real freaky around this point, from the time we heard the noise to the time we searched upstairs we thought for sure we would see some one.

 After we exit the garage we circled the house, blinds are open so we scan inside as we make the lap around the yard. As we reached the garage again, we both are completely shocked to find the door, from the house to the garage(the one I had just shut) was wide open. At this point I remembered about the a mentally handicap child in the neighborhood who had on a couple occasions wandered into peoples houses. Thinking that had to be it, I walked inside yelling out to anyone who might be in the house. We then heard a banging sound coming from the 3rd story of the house. 

The 3rd story had a landing where all the bedroom doors are visible from the main floor. Looking up we could hear whatever it was inside my bedroom. Still thinking it might be this kid, and not wanting to look like a puss in front of my friend I venture up the stairs. While making my slow accent I inform whoever I'm coming up, and asking who they are. Not getting any response I approached the door which was open about 6 to 8 inches. The door opens to the right and inside to the left was my desk. As I opened the door, I hear a rush of movement on my desk, and as if someone had their palm on the stack of papers, and flinging them outwards the paper fly's in the air like large confetti. I turn looked down at my friend and said ""lets go to your house"" he promptly agreed and we left. 

I never had anything like that happen since, and my house was only 8 years old at the time. The End.       ",,False,,t5_2sntx,1371715995.0,,,True,t3_1gpjp7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gpjp7/just_found_this_sub_so_i_present_to_you_the_time/,

The first time I experienced something strange involved handprints in my pillow. I didn't have the kinds of pillows that will take an impression easily, they just sprang back to shape, so when I saw some hand prints in the pillow I was like ""that's weird.""

I wiped the pillow expecting the hand prints to go away, they came right back. I put my hand to the prints, wondering how I so thoroughly imprinted them into the pillow, and saw my hands were much larger than the hand prints. After wiping them away and watching them return several times I started thinking ""Okay, this is not normal."" After about ten minutes of observing these persistent hand prints they suddenly faded away and were gone. It was very much like someone was pressing invisible hands into the pillow for a while.

Still a skeptic, I dismissed it as a fluke.

We had an alarm on the house that would beep three times anytime a door was opened. One day my roommates left for the day. ""Beep beep beep.""

I'm sitting on my bed reading, my door is slightly ajar, and I can see the door of my roommate's bedroom through the door. The house wasn't on a solid foundation and, rather, had a crawlspace beneath the house. This made it so you could feel and hear every single footstep a person took through the floor unless they were being particularly quiet. I began feeling footsteps and hearing them. I kept seeing a shadow move across my peripheral vision in and out of my roommates' bedroom.

I was busy reading and just assumed my roommates had come home early. The shadow kept crossing though and suddenly two things registered in my mind. The ""beep beep beep"" of my roommates returning never happened, the door had not been opened again. I also realized that if someone was going in and out of the room I'd not just see their shadow, I'd also see them pass.

I stop reading and stare at the door. I can still feel and hear the footsteps in the house. You get to where you can tell which room and which part of a room a person is in based on their footsteps. Someone is walking around in the living room. I see the shadow cross two more times, this time clearly. A third pass and the shadow stops in my field of vision. The head turns out of profile, as though looking at me, and lingers.

Now here's where everyone who told me the house was haunted would freak out and run away, as they all said they have done when they experienced these kinds of incidents. What I did was get up and follow the shadow, wanting to know precisely what's happening.

As I entered the living room the shadowman started moving towards the kitchen. I could feel and hear the footsteps as I followed him. As I follow him I make an observation that he is a single, very dark shadow that you can see even on top of other shadows. I note that the only light source in the room is a ceiling fan with three bulbs in it, which makes all physical objects in the room cast three separate shadows slightly offset. Even my own shadow is in threes. Shadowman is not.

As he passes through the door into the kitchen he disappears, but his footsteps are still audible, and of course I can feel them through the floor. I can tell the direction of the footsteps clearly. Suddenly I hear the distinct sound of the squeaky cabinet door closing, a sound it makes every single time you close it. It was already closed.

That was my first encounter with the shadow man. He appeared to me several times since and I would always follow him and see how long I could keep him in my field of vision. Sometimes you would see physical objects move before you saw him. I can't say the two are directly related as objects moving on their own were not always accompanied by the shadowman's visual presence. Others have mentioned seeing a woman in the house. I never saw her but enough people have confirmed it that, after seeing the shadowman enough times, I'm inclined to believe they've seen her. I've been around when friends would see the shadowman, as well, and it was often a lot less climactic with multiple people around. We'd just say ""Well, you've just seen the shadowman.""

A friend of mine has a story from the house that I wasn't there for. Him and my roommate and her friend were sitting around and he didn't believe the place was haunted. To test it he began talking mad shit about ""the ghost."" Really vitriolic stuff, things like he probably killed himself because his mother was so disappointed in him and so forth. After about five minutes of this he said ""See, if this place was haunted that pussy ghost would do something about this.""

At that point the metal splash shield behind the stove and all the pots and pans that were sitting on the stove flew across the room and clattered across the floor violently.

Even having chased the shadowman around the house on multiple occasions I would not have believed this story without three witnesses confirming it, including my closest friend who is a complete skeptic and not prone to flights of fancy.

I could go on about strange occurrences in that house but I've already accrued a wall of text.

TL;DR: Didn't believe I lived in a haunted house until I saw plenty of evidence.

My family moved into the house that I grew up in when I was 5 years old. The house was a two-story with a basement. I never felt 100% safe in that house. Specifically I felt very uncomfortable and ""not safe"" in the basement and in my bedroom. The rest of the house didn't bother me. Now, it's entirely possible that this was because I was very young and had moved to a new place, but either way the feelings persisted for the rest of my time there. I learned to ignore it as best I could - which was easier to do for my bedroom and almost impossible to do for the basement. Our basement was furnished so it didn't look scary. [Here's a basic layout so it's less confusing as I talk about it.](http://imgur.com/qzO3aC6) So the ""rooms"" were open, except for the workroom which did have a door. 

Also, random electronics would always turn themselves off throughout the house, but I've always chalked that up to faulty wiring of some sort.

The first experience I had was when I was about 12 years old. My best friend (BF) and I were home alone while my parents were at my grandparents house. They only lived a few houses away and my parents just told us to not leave the house while they were gone. All of the doors to my house were locked, windows shut/locked, electronics off, no one called the phone while my parents were gone (so the answering machine couldn't have been tripped). Now despite being scared of the basement, most of the time when friends came over we would either spend time outside or in the basement because my parents were less likely to bug us while we were there and up until this point nothing had ever actually happened to scare me in the basement. So BF and I were spending time in Area 3 (on the side closer to Area 1). I went up to the 2nd story to go retrieve something from my room while BF stayed where she was. While I was up there I heard a muffled man's voice yelling ""ANYBODY HOME??"" BF let out a shriek and ran up to the first floor and at this point I was running downstairs to meet her there screaming her name to make sure she was ok. We checked around the first floor, but like I said, the doors were locked, windows shut/locked, tv/radios off, and again no one called us on the phone. No one was anywhere near the house. I asked her what happened and she said that the voice had clearly been coming from my dad's workroom. Now, like I said, I heard it kind of muffled because I was upstairs, but I could still hear it and understand what it was saying, so this voice was loud. The only window in the basement was one of those tiny tiny things that no one can fit in and it didn't open at all. It was also on the opposite side of the basement from the workroom. We told my parents what happened when they got home, but my parents thought we were making it up.

Needless to say, I made sure that if I went in the basement I would always have someone with me from this point forward unless absolutely necessary. Some time after this - I'm not sure exactly when but it was probably about a year after, I had another experience. My mom was in the kitchen one morning/early afternoon and she wanted me to put the kitchen scale away for her in the basement (I still don't know why we kept it there, but we did). I tried to avoid it but she looked at me sternly and told me to go do it. So I went downstairs (to Area 1), found the cabinet, put the scale away, and turned around to see my dad in Area 2 near the border of Area 1 right at where the stairs start. I asked him if he would mind turning off the lights since I was just headed back upstairs. He told me it would be no problem and then headed back towards his workroom. I went upstairs and thought nothing of it until later that day, my dad started yelling at me because I didn't turn off the lights in the basement. I then said ""But I asked if you would do it when you were down there and you said you would!"" My dad replied that he hadn't been in the basement at all that day until just then and he had no idea what I was talking about.

Those are the two big things that happened in that house. Once I went off to college and came home for the summer after my first year I felt very nervous and uncomfortable in my room again and I slept on the couch in the living room for a month. The only reason I went back to sleeping in my room that summer was because my grandma was visiting (they no longer had a house nearby) and she was staying in my room and I didn't want her to be in there by herself. My parents divorced and got rid of the house not too long after this.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1bu0gk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1bu0gk/i_grew_up_with_a_creepy_basement/,

I was talking to my dad about a popular ghost reality show, and how I thought it was a load of crap. He said, ""Well, you used to scare me and your mother a bit."" Cue quizzical look from me, I don't ever remember being particularly spooky. He went on to tell me that when I was around two or three, I would tell my parents how I could walk through closed doors at night, out through our locked front door and 'fly' to my Grandma's house to visit her. Freaky enough. Around that same age (three years old) my grandfather on my dad's side passed away during the night. My mum came in early that morning to get me up and dressed, but all the while I was babbling to her about something. She stopped what she was doing to ask me what I was talking about. She says I told her ""(deceased) Granda was here last night, he said hello."" As my dad told it, they pretty much freaked out when I said that, but didn't tell anyone else in the family. 

So, those stories rattled me quite a bit. I understand that babies and small children are closer to the spirit world as it were so are maybe more open to experiences like this. But that's not all, during my later teenage years (15-19), I had a couple of experiences that rattled me.

One night in the early hours, I woke up to two figures standing above me. They weren't distinct outlines, more like shadowy hooded figures (somewhat like the ghost of christmas to come from the Muppets Christmas Carol) one on each side of my bed. The figure to the right of my bed I sensed wanted to do me harm. But the figure on the left of the bed reached out to the other figure and grasped it, forbidding it from harming me. During this, I did not feel scared. 

A couple of years later when I was about 19, I was living in another city with a couple of friends from university in an old terraced house. The place was built about 100 years ago and it felt 'old'. Again, I was awoken during the night to see a short, balding man with a moustache sitting at the end of my bed. He was quite skinny and wearing a string vest with brown trousers and over-shoulder suspenders. He said nothing, but as I sat up to switch the light on he disappeared. I didn't feel scared at all, just puzzled and if anything, curious to know who he was. I didn't see the man again but we would always hear foot steps up and down the stairs and knocks on our respective doors, with no one on the other side. 

That was about six years ago. I have always been interested in the paranormal but have never really actively sought it. I have always just thought of my experiences as quite interesting. Other smaller things have happened more recently, but I don't want this to be a mammoth post! It's good to know other people have had their brushes with beyond.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_13mwmk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/13mwmk/my_own_sporadic_experiences_of_the_paranormal/,

A key feature of the show is that there are multiple (at least 3) witnesses to the events or to the effects the events have had. There is no narrator; these individuals tell their story to the camera and dramatic reconstructions bring it to life.

She opened her eyes and there was a very angry long haired woman's head hovering right above hers screaming at her with no sound coming out.  Details that made it extra horrible were... 1. This took place in Japan (where fucked up movies like the grudge take place) 2. Her mom was in the kitchen  (so having someone awake in the other room did not help) 3. The face was very close to hers + the ghost's mouth was wide open screaming + her long dark hair was flying back and worst of all...4.  We were art majors so she drew me a picture of what it looked like.

Ive been freaked out ever since.

Too make me even more paranoid, the woman's head she drew looked like a ghost picture another friend had shown me years before.  His brother was on vacation in Hawaii and after developing his film, found the photo at the end of his roll with a similar screaming head floating in the ceiling of his hotel room.

There's a lot of peculiar things in the area of the ghost town, like a graveyard mostly full of babies (appropriately coined ""the baby graves""), and ""Stella's hill,"" which is rumored to be the place where the townspeople hung the local witch, who then cast a spell on the town that would make all the babies die and people move away. As far as the spell, I can't vouch for the validity of that story. However, Plemons was/is believed to be the local Satanic meeting site. Personally, I have never seen anything ""odd"" out there, but my mother went to the baby graves in the 70s and saw a sheet blocking the entrance and a fire glowing back in the cemetary. The next day she went back and found a lot of dead black cats. 20 years later, my cousin found cattle hanging from the side of the bridge. I personally believe these claims to be true and I believe Satanic happenings take place in Plemons. I'll add some links and pictures about the town for y'all to see. 

Also, as a side story, after everyone died or moved away, the landowners tore down and buried all of the buildings. I'm not sure why they chose to do this. It may have something to do with the gas refinery a few miles away (it used to have frequent explosions), or development of ranch land.

This one occurred fairly recently, over winter break.  My friend and I had been hiking like we normally do, and decided to take one of the trails that we usually don't.  When I say trail, I mean the beginning of a small game trail, and then just wilderness, not really any trail system.  We had been in the area before, and had seen large pieces of half-buried aluminum.  Now, we didn't think too much of these torn up pieces of aluminum, because there had only been one reported plane crash and it was on the other side of the mountain and in the 50's.  We had speculated that there may have indeed been a crash that wend unreported or was covered up, but we attributed the scraps to leftovers from the building of radio towers on the summit of the mountain, and these leftovers had been washed down in torrential rains we had a few years back.  However, the pieces we found sure did look like what you see when you look out of your window on a plane and look at the wing.  They had rivets, but I am not sure if they were the right kind.  Anyway, we had come upon a large piece of this aluminum and decided to dig it up.  we were at it for about 10 minutes when my friend whispered to me ""there's a guy about 30 feet behind you watching us, what should we do?"" Now people like to hike up there but usually do not come that far up and this was the first person we had seen in a long time.  I glanced at him, then stood up and waved.  He waved back, and moved closer.  I stood up completely and faced him in case he tried something, as he was acting a little sketchy, and I just had that weird feeling about him, you know? He stopped walking towards us and said: ""You guys feel that? That is a bad vibe coming from that thing.  People died there."" This gave me the chills, but I asked him what he knew about it.  He came over and told us ""They never told anyone about it, did they? People died from that, you can feel the presence, be careful.  I have to go up now, good bye, take care."" And with that he continued up into the mountains.  He seemed like a nice guy, and wasn't really as creepy as he sounded.  He had a small backpack and light winter clothes on.  My friend and I waited for a little, and then decided to follow him.  We knew the area really well, and just wanted to see where he was going.  There was a ridge running parallel to the path that he was taking so we took to that and watch him from above and behind, we being the creepy ones now.  We had a perfect view of him, as there were no trees, and when he stopped so did we and I watched with my binoculars.  I know this was somewhat wrong of me to spy on him, but something told me that there was more to this guy than met the eye.  Anyway, he had been sitting on a rock for about 20 minutes.  It was getting dark, and he definitely did not have the gear to stay the night, nor had he spent any time preparing any type of shelter or fire.  Just when we were getting ready to leave, he stood up, started walking further up the ravine that he was in, passed behind a bush and did not emerge from the other side.  He just disappeared.  He couldn't have been hiding, all that was down there were a few rocks and bushes.  He was not hiding behind the bush that he passed behind, because it was only thick enough to obscure a person, not fully hide them, and he disappeared in the split second between when I had been anticipating him emerging from the other side.  We immediately went down there and found nothing, no tracks or traces.  It was a physical impossibility for him to have hidden or ran from where he was to elude us.

I wanted to share a couple of my experiences with you guys, they're not too exciting or anything, but when they happened they definitely freaked me out.

I was with a couple of friends one night (D and Vince) when my friend Steph calls my friend D asking him if we can go keep her company while she's house sitting.  We talked it over and decided we had nothing better to do, so we went out to meet her where she was house sitting (next town over).  We get there, we chit chat, we eat some food, and then decided we were going to watch some movies.  We all sit down and go through one movie before putting in a second one and falling asleep halfway through.  Steph wakes up and gets up to go to sleep in the guest room (which is her assigned room while she's house sitting) and accidentally wakes me up while she's collecting her blankets to go to the room.  She notices that I've woken up and so she asks if I want her to turn the television off, my friend Vince then wakes up who is sitting on my left (D is on my right and all three of us are on the same couch) so I ask him what he thinks and he says he doesn't care, so I tell her to leave it on.  I don't remember what me and Vince decided we were going to watch but whatever it was, we fell asleep in the middle of it and when I woke up again, the television was displaying static without the white noise.  I sat there for a bit not able to fall back asleep and not really wanting to get up and turn the television off because I was cold, so I continued to sit and try to fall back asleep, when I heard it.  I heard someone walking through the dining room (which was on the left of us through a big archway) from the direction of the bedrooms towards the kitchen.  I slightly turned my head to my left to see if I could see Steph since she was the only other person in the house, but I saw no one.  That's when I thought ""maybe it's the dog"" (even though the dog could not have sounded like a person walking across a room with hard wood floors, especially when it was the size of a teacup poodle), but then I realized the dog was asleep on the other couch on the other side of the room, so my last rational thought was that it was the cat, but I knew it wasn't.  The cat had been walking around the living room and rest of the house the entire night prior to us even sitting down and watching movies, and those footsteps sounded nothing like the cat and his noisy collar.  All of those thoughts went through my head as the footsteps continued, till finally I got too spooked and lifted the blanket up over my head as if it were some protective shield to keep me safe.  I sat there under the blanket for a couple seconds when I heard the footsteps stop in what sounded like the kitchen area.  The blanket to my left then started to move and I thought it was Vince shifting in his sleep, when I saw the blanket lift over his head and Vince's face look over at me looking terrified while shaking his head as if to say ""this is not f***ing happening!"".  As we sat there, staring at each other in silence continuing to listen, we heard another noise, it was coming from the kitchen and I recognized it as someone crinkling a chip bag.  It went on for a couple of seconds then stopped, and then it was silent.  I remember thinking ""we can't sit here awake for the rest of the night being scared that we'll hear something else"" so it was about a couple minutes later when (could have been less, but it felt like a couple of minutes) I quickly pulled the blankets off of my head and said D's name really loudly trying to wake him up and trying to exaggerate everything I was doing to keep from being scared.  ""D, get up!  I heard something in the kitchen!"" and he replied with a sleepy ""what?..."" so I said ""Yeah, I wanna see what it is!"".  He said ok and got up with me, Vince followed us into the kitchen as I shoved D in first to turn the lights on, it was all a big loud spectacle to keep me feeling brave.  There was nothing, and no one in there, so I poked my head through the doorway on the other side of the kitchen that led into the garage where the owners kept their food (sort of like a pantry I guess, it's also where the cat slept), when I saw the cat stand up from his bed, walk to the doorway, stretch groggily and stare at us with morning eyes, probably wondering why we were being so loud.

We told D what had happened, and the three of us ended up staying awake till morning.  When Steph woke up, we told her what had happened, she told us that she'd had similar experiences in that house and that was one of the reasons she wanted us to keep her company that night.  D told her that it would have been nice if she had told us ahead of time, and she just kind of laughed like she was embarrassed and then apologized, agreeing that she probably should have said something about it.

I groggily got up, took them back into their room right down the hall (the laundry room which has the door blocked by those little pet gates that fit in the doorway), and went back to bed.

Well, later on I finally wake up on my own around 10:00 AM. I look at the clock, which is right across from my bed, and then I turn my head to the side and look at the wall and think about what I want for breakfast. I look back only a few seconds later and the clock suddenly says 12:00 PM.

I didn't fall asleep, I didn't even close my eyes longer than a normal blink. One moment it was around 10, and the next it was around 12. So somehow I just lost two hours of my time. I am just a little shocked and wondering what the hell all that was about. I got up and went to the kitchen to find my mom and step dad. Told them about the occurrence, but obviously there wasn't much to say about it.

So I was fixing my food and I asked them why one of them got up at 7:00 AM and let the dogs into my room to wake me up on a Saturday. They both looked at me a little weird and said they didn't let the dogs out of their room and that they weren't even up at that time. It was then that I also remembered a very important fact: I sleep with my door shut. So somehow, the dogs got out of their room, and got into mine without assistance. Also of note was that when I went to put the dogs back into their room after they woke me up, I noticed the doggie door gate was lying against the wall to the right of the door frame, it wasn't like the dogs busted it down somehow (which they have never done or attempted to do before or now).

I know it's easy to say ""well of course it was your parents, they're just fucking with you,"" but I don't believe that at all. My mom doesn't work, and she is NOT a morning person. She just doesn't wake up at 7:00 or close to it. My step dad wasn't working that day, and he would have been sleeping in. They aren't the kind of dog owners that will get up at the crack of dawn and let their dogs out to piss or whatever, either. The dogs are on their schedule... they are let out whenever one of my parents wakes up. Also, they just aren't the joking type, and my mom especially is a shitty liar and would crack up and give herself away if they were trying to fuck with me. But furthermore, they've never let the dogs in to wake me up. They just wouldn't even do that, especially as it was a weekend (I work full time M-F, so they know I need as much sleep as I can on the weekends).

So that's pretty much the most ""paranormal"" thing I've experienced. Lost two hours in seconds, and magical dogs that have temporary growth spurts and opposable thumbs, it would seem.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_12fnmj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/12fnmj/reality_glitch_i_experienced_and_discussion_of/,

I slept in the back room which had a light fixture like [this] (http://oneluckycouple.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/front-entryway-old-light-fixture.jpg?w=500&amp;h=375). It's relevant. The one in the room was bigger and didn't have that little extra on top. Anyway, in this room, I saw my imaginary friends, which I called my Sparkle Friends. I called them Sparkle Friends because they were literally glowing/sparkling orbs of light. I saw them before I went to sleep every night and they lived inside of the light fixture.

I did not have to verbally talk to my Sparkle Friends. We spoke telepathically. Over time, my Sparkle Friends began to change shape - the one I remember the most, and was like the leader, was shaped like a carousel pony with intricate detail. One day I decided to tell my parents. They shrugged it off, all little kids have imaginary friends. That night, my Sparkle Friends told me that I wasn't supposed to tell my parents about them. I, of course, ended up telling my parents, the next day, that my Sparkle Friends did not want me to tell anyone about them. That night, my mom brought a glass of milk to the room and put it on the night stand. The next morning my brother came to wake me up and saw the milk had been poured all over my head and I was all nasty and sticky. My parents asked me what happened and I told them, I told you my Sparkle Friends said I wasn't supposed to tell you about them.

I never saw my Sparkle Friends after that. My parents thought the whole thing was REALLY weird and spoke to a psychologist friend about it. The psychologist said that because, as a small child, I was telling them the same story over and over, without any changes in my story, the likelihood that I was making it up was slim.

To this day, it freaks me the fuck out. Those light fixtures creep me out too.

There was a building nearby that had supposedly been a short term mental institution a long, long time ago, and there were rumors that it was haunted. Some friends and I gained access (legally) and I had the creepiest half hour of my life. Every single word of this is true, and there are several witnesses who all tell the exact same story. 

The building had a simple layout. It was one long hallway with bedrooms on either side. Three floors (a basement, two floors and an unused attic). The stairs were in the middle of the building, where there was a type of lobby. We took the stairs to the attic and the door opened from the south side of the building. In the attic there were two naked bulbs hanging from the peaked, unfinished ceiling and one window on the west end and one on the east end. When we walked in, we all started looking east. There was this tall, shadowy figure. Standing at approximately seven feet, it had legs that seemed to narrow into hooves with very large thighs...like a goat. This shadow was running back and forth, north to south, very quickly. Then the shadow transformed into a floating orange ball and floated around erratically. Again, it transformed...this time, the ball erupted as sparks and there were waves left in the air. It looked like heat waves. Then it charged towards us. Once it got to within ten feet, it disappeared. 
One of the people in the group ended up with what looked like a severe sunburn, and felt very hot to the touch. Then the burn went away within twenty minutes.

I actually posted this on another site called Your Ghost Stories. Check it out if you haven't already.

This is one of the earliest memories I had. When I was a small boy, my father used to take me around with him whenever he paid a girlfriend a visit. It's sleazy I know; he would just leave me alone while he engaged in sexual relations with this woman or that woman. On this occasion, he was paying a visit to an old girlfriend. He left me outside of the house to pretty much fend for myself. 

Anyway, as I was playing around the yard, I suddenly ran into a little boy. He was slightly older than me, with dark hair. He asked me if I wanted to play and I said yes. I was lonely and didn't know when my dad would be done. So the boy and I started chasing each other around the yard.

I distinctly remember that there were times when the boy seemed to just disappear. I would turn a corner immediately after him and he would be gone. All of a sudden he would pop up behind me. Keep in mind this was a well manicured yard with very few places to hide.

Eventually, I wound up chasing him into the house. He ducked into a bedroom and I followed him in. I noticed that he ducked behind the one bed in the room. I couldn't see him but I knew he was there. For some reason, I suddenly got very excitable. I started to grab things off of shelves around the room and throw them at the bed. Every time I did, the boy would pop up and laugh, and then disappear behind the bed again. At this point, I was making quite a mess in the room but didn't seem to care because I was having an insane amount of fun. I also really, really wanted to hit the boy with something. At least, that's how it seemed.

There was a grey doll house in the room. It was beautiful and ornate, intricately designed and fragile. It was the last thing I grabbed and I hurled it across the room. It shattered against the wall, and the pieces landed behind the bed. The boy didn't pop up this time though. 

Well, I guess I must of made quite the ruckus because my father and his ""friend"" came storming into the room. When the lady saw the mess she was astronomically pissed, and asked what I was doing. I tried to explain that I was playing with the boy (I'm sorry; I just can't remember his name). To my surprise, she asked ""What boy?""

Now this was a small bedroom and I had this kid cornered. There was no way for him to get out of there with out my noticing. And when my dad and his friend came in, they would've noticed the boy slipping out. My dad checked the room, under the bed, everywhere. The boy wasn't there. 

This lady demanded that my father leave. I couldn't blame her. I had just destroyed her place. I'll never understand why I felt the need to hit this kid just that I was overwhelmed with the sensation that it was the right thing to do at the time. Now, I don't know how many of you have had an experience like this, but it's stayed with me my entire life, and only recently has it begun to sink in that this whole experience was quite possibly paranormal. I do believe that as children we are more susceptible to these kinds of events. Was this boy a ghost that wanted to get me in trouble for some reason? I don't think I'll ever know the answer to that.

I'm not a very good storyteller, meaning I'm not very descriptive when It comes to these sorts of things. But I'll try my best. Anyway, I've experienced paranormal activity before when I was younger and have posted things on r/Ghosts in the past so this kinda stuff isn't new or weird to me at all. But I have to say this experience creeped me out like no other. 

It was pretty early in the morning. My stepdad was at work already and my mom was still passed out cold in her room. I was listening to music and browsing reddit actually when my little sisters (Cate and Claire) came in my room scared shitless. They made me jump for sure because I was in a total state of bliss I guess you could say. Cate was crying and Claire was trying to explain to me what happened. Apparently the dogs were barking so Cate went downstairs to let them outside. She then tells me that when she almost got off the stairs she saw a shadow-like appariton move down the hallway. What's freaky is Cate said that she heard the thing whispering before disappearing in the other room. Before she ran upstairs, she checked the other rooms to see if it was any real person but there was no one but her and the dogs. So, frightened out of her little mind she races back upstairs to get Claire and that's where I come in.

 Not fully convinced, I listen anyway and to humor them I said I'd check it out. I then gave Claire a toy sword to protect Cate and I, myself brought down my baseball bat and cross necklace all the while Cate is repeating, ""In the name of Jesus Christ leave me alone!"". Funny thing to be doing at 8 o' clock in the morning if you want my honest opinion. But when we got downstairs it felt different. I felt on edge the entire time because I'm wondering if someone is in the house that could hurt us or if it's something supernatural. Every room we'd go into I'd get the growing feeling we weren't alone, like we're being watched. I still wonder if it was just my nerves or something else. So after we searched the house we ended up going down the same hallway Cate saw the thing and there on the table was a lit candle. I asked my sisters if they've been messing with my lighters and they said no. They looked just as surprised as I was. I know my stepdad wouldn't leave a candle lit when he leaves the house and my mom was passed out upstairs sleeping. I was actually scared from this, I immediately told the girls to wake mom up and stay in her room til dad gets home from work and I did a full sweep of the house before retreating back to my room. 

Later that evening we confronted my stepdad and he said he didn't even light a candle neither did my mom. I trust my little sisters completely. If Cate was lying then she's an awfully good actress because she was crying and shaking all over the place. Well, thanks for listening to my story.

It's a fairly big, old farmhouse built in like 1910 or something like that. 
These are several experiences dealt with by my whole family.
I'll start with my mom.

When we first moved into my house my mom and her friend decided to take the kids to the beach for the day. They left all day and when they came back the neighbors told them the police were at our house and there was also a note on the door saying to call the police. My mom calls and asks what's going on? They proceed to tell her that a young girl called 911 and said there was a murder going on in the house. The police rushed over looked through all the windows couldn't see anything and left a note(I don't know why they just didn't break into the house but it was over 20 yrs ago so I don't know, actually thinking about it now the neighbors were probably talking to the police and said we weren't home). My mom not really thinking walked through the entire basement looking and found nothing. Telling the police we were at the beach all day. 

A few years past and I'm about 3 at this point. The upstairs of the house was being renovated and everyone was sleeping on the main floor in the living as it wasn't safe upstairs and my parents had all little kids. My mom goes out one night with a friend and when they get home my mom's friend notices that I'm in the upstairs window pressed up completely against the window. My mom absolutely freaks out and thinks I'm going to fall through. She tells her friend to wait under the window and she's going to run in and get me. She comes inside goes to go upstairs and I'm sleeping on the couch. She walks back outside looks up at the window with her friend and both of them watch as my face slowly turns into a skeleton then completely disappears.

My two brothers and uncle(I have a very young uncle that is close in age with all of us) lived in the huge basement at the time. My parents turned it into one big bedroom and they all stayed down there. They normally didn't have any problems but one night they said they were just spooked for no reason. Everyone was feeling sick that day and it was just off. They went to bed that night and in the middle of the night woke up to a little girl down in the basement telling them to leave. My brothers and uncle absolutely freaked out and ran upstairs, padlocked the door (because that stops ghosts if you didn't know), and slept in the living room. My mom came downstairs in the morning and asked them why they were on the couch. They told her the story and she didn't believe them. Now as the day goes on everyone in the house was just getting sicker and sicker no one really knew why and all us kids were mostly passed out. My mom could barely stay awake and when my dad got home from work, he owned a landscape business and was outside all day, he realized something was wrong. Calls the gas company and they send someone out. Turns out we had a carbon monoxide leak and it was so bad the guy told my parents that if anyone had stayed in the basement all night they would have died. Luckily for us after a trip to the hospital we were all fine and recovered quickly.

There also times where my mom's friends would hear their names being called, we would hear loud crashes like glass breaking only to find nothing broken, just weird paranormal occurrences.

The stadium closed to the public at night, but was rarely patrolled by security and had several entrances that were never locked.  They approached the field, when they began to hear chanting. They peered around the corner to see anywhere from 40 to 50 people in dark hooded cloaks standing in front of a fire (There was no fire pit, as it was a football field).

What made it so unusual was the fact that it was 2.00 am, the station had been closed for the night and there were no contractors scheduled to be working there. My Dad thought it might be it might be some crazy homeless person (it is London) and rang the Station Supervisor, a man with 23 years of experience of working on the underground, and asked to him to investigate. 

The Station Supervisor went down to the eastbound tunnel and looked in it and all around the immediate area but could find no trace of the man in the white overalls. Using a telephone at the foot of the escalator he rang my father and told him that he had conducted a thorough search of the area but hadn’t been able to find the man. 

My Dad, clearly perplexed said “But this guy was standing next to you. How could you not see him?”

The Station Supervisor assured him that he had conducted a very thorough check of the area and that there was definitely no-one down there. He even asked my father whether the image of the man could have been the result of a “blip” on the CCTV system but, when he was assured that the system was in perfect working order, he agreed to conduct a second search of the area just to be absolutely certain. 

The Station Supervisor went and conducted another search of the area but the result was the same as the first. He could not find any trace of the man in the tunnel or in the immediate vicinity of the tunnel. 

He returned to the telephone at the foot of the escalator, called my Dad and told him that the second search had also failed to find any trace of the man in the white overalls. My Dad is insistent, however, that as he watched the second search of the area on his TV screen being conducted he had clearly seen the man in white overalls standing within touching distance of the Station Supervisor and walking after him when he left.

Dad thanked him for carrying out the searches and rang off. As the Station Supervisor turned and walked back onto the eastbound platform he noticed to his left a bench and on that bench was there was a pair of white paper overalls. 

The Station Supervisor was certain that if anyone had walked out of the tunnel whilst he had been on the telephone he would have seen them and he would also have seen anyone leaving the overalls on the platform bench.

This isn't a story, just a few strange experiences I've had recently.

1. My SO goes to work very early in the morning--he's usually out the door by a quarter to four in the morning. His morning routine often wakes me up. On one of those mornings when I was still awake after he'd gone, I heard a man's voice on the stairs not far from our bedroom door. Thinking the SO had forgotten something and come back, I went out to meet him. No one was there; he hadn't come home. The house was empty except for me and our sleeping kid.

2. One day, his mother was convinced that I'd been in the upstairs hall; she swore up and down that she'd even seen me go around the corner when she came out to see if I needed something. I was nowhere near that hall.

3. When I get a chance, I like to put my kid's toys and stuff away during the day, so that I can have at least a few minutes of order before it all goes to entropy again. I was doing that one day by myself when he was out with his grandparents. His drum set was in the middle of the bedroom. I had my back turned to it when the cymbal clanged. I turned around. There was nothing that could have hit the cymbal or made any similar noise.

4. I just remembered this one, a very minor one: once, right after I'd put the little one down for his nap, I glanced over at the far end of the bedroom just in time to see an odd dark mist seem to pass through the room.

Again, I'm not creeped out--this isn't that kind of story. I don't feel anything scary or malevolent around me. I'm just intrigued and thought I would share.

I don't think this house has always been haunted. It's relatively new, and to my knowledge nothing bad enough to create a haunting has happened here. The only thing I can think of that might have triggered these events is a trip the SO, the kid, and I took to a very old local cemetery about a month or so ago. The place has graves dating to the early nineteenth century, and we spent a while exploring there.

I'll try to be brief...

It was two years ago that I lay in bed with my wife lying sleeping beside me (I tell you now that we are both believers in aliens but not prone to exaggeration or hysteria over the subject - we are both University Graduates and professional people). Anyway, I was lying on my back in the darkness (awake) when the bedroom door opened slightly and a small dwarf size 'creature' came rushing in (I could describe it in more detail if anyone is interested) - it kinda scrambled over the bottom of the bed but without causing much sensation of additional weight being on the bed. It stepped over my outstretched legs and sidled up to me. I was frozen in terror just staring at it but I was sure it was about to talk to me or do something which I was to pay attention to - but to my surprise (and bewilderment) it stretched itself up to look quickly out a window above my head (a small window above the bed) it then crouched down toward my ear as though about to whisper something - strangely I was ready to listen and fully expecting it to start speaking - as that was the only thing I could think of it wanting to do by adopting that position - it didn't speak - it stabbed me. 

I have no idea what it stabbed me with - but it felt like a hypodermic needle- I felt it go through my ribs and into the mid section of my left lung. It then stood upright on the bed again and rushed quickly out the door. As I gathered my senses I woke my wife who said she heard nothing, saw nothing, I got up, made coffee and wondered if I was going nuts but the feeling where it 'stabbed me' absolutely convinced me this was real - I was certain it was nothing 'demonic' or a product of my imagination - I absolutely believed right there and then that a 'little alien' had climbed up on my bed and the little *okker stabbed me.

I wrote to a friend by e-mail the following morning detailing what had happened and then spent weeks trying to talk myself out of believing what had happened.

6 weeks later I collapsed with severe chest pains and was rushed by ambulance to ER with a suspected heart attack. Fortunately it wasn't - but I was told that had I not collapsed then in another 24 hours I would have been dead - I had a massive pneumonia in the mid section of my left lung. It was so bad I was in hospital for a couple of weeks and it was only when I got out that my friend contacted me to remind me of the e-mail I sent her detailing the puncturing of my left lung by a little 'alien'.

I know it all sounds contrived, or crazy - but those are the facts. Maybe it wasn't an alien? Maybe it was demonic? But for some reason I am totally convinced it was an alien.

Also, I'd like to mention that my dog is extremely protective of me and used to sleep at the foot of my bed every night (she's done this since she was a puppy), but just before this all began she started to refuse to go into my bedroom. She wouldn't even walk down the hallway to go past my closed door.* 

About a year ago I was suffering from terrible insomnia, but only when I was trying to sleep in my room. I could sleep just fine when I was at other people's houses or on the couch, essentially anywhere. But when I was in my own bed I never got a wink of sleep. That lasted for about a month undisturbed. I was tired, cranky, etc. but that was it. *I think it's also worth mentioning that I've never experienced any type of sleep paralysis or hallucination from sleep deprivation (I have a long history of insomnia).* So I stayed up most nights. Usually I'd just lay in bed with the lights off, trying desperately to fall asleep. But, much to my dismay, it never worked. I tried all of the textbook relaxation techniques, took melatonin, everything my mother and I could think of to help me sleep normally, but nothing ever came of it.

Then the whispering started. It was faint at first, sometimes I wasn't even sure I'd actually heard it, and it would only last for a moment. And it was always the same thing: someone calling my name from across the room. I chalked it up to the wind or the creaking wood floors of our house. But as time went on the whispers got louder. And closer. At first I thought, hoped, it was someone in the house playing a trick on me, perhaps my brother getting back at me for a prank I'd pulled. I'd even considered that I was in some weird half-sleep state and had started imagining things. But I couldn't understand why, only now, had I started hearing things? I told myself again and again that it must have been the everyday noises of an old house. But once it sounded as though the whispers were coming from right next to me, I knew something was wrong. Each time it happened I would turn to see where the sound was coming from, turn on the light in the hopes that I'd finds some explanation. But there was never anything there. 

I didn't know what to think. I was too embarrassed to tell anyone for fear of being made fun of, especially because no one else in my house was having any...weird experiences like this, nor had they ever. I was terrified at this point, but I dealt with it. Being raised in a Catholic family, the last thing I wanted to do was even hint at the *possibility* that there was a demon in the house. I didn't know what kind of reaction I would get.

This went on for a few weeks, each night the whispers getting closer and closer. I did my best to block them out, and usually caught up on sleep by taking naps on the couch after school. But the sleep deprivation eventually caught up with me. I was in bed at probably 2 or 3 in the morning and had managed to doze off with my back facing the door to my room. What I awoke to is something that frightened more than I can even begin to describe. It was the whispering of my name, as usual, but this time the thing was so close that I could feel its breath on the back of my neck. I flipped over and turned on every light in my room faster than I thought possible. Once again, there was nothing there. I sat curled up in a ball up against my wall until sunlight, refusing to sleep again until I had found some resolution.

That day I walked several miles to the church I was raised in (but hadn't been to in years--I considered myself an atheist at this point). I was desperate, and had started considering the possibility that I had been abandoned by God for my misdeeds, and that that was the reason I was being haunted by this thing. I sat inside next to the Virgin Mary statue I had always prayed next to and waited to speak with the priest that had performed my baptism. He was always incredibly kind and understanding, so I knew I could divulge this secret without fear of being judged. 

I told him I must have sinned greatly by denouncing my faith and the church, and that I feared God was punishing me for it. I was so scared, and had been on the verge of tears for weeks now. He seemed truly concerned at hearing this and asked me what had happened to make me think such a thing. I explained the events of the last few months, and all the color left his face. In the 17 years I had known him, never once had I seen this jolly old Irishman without a loving smile on his face, and at that moment he had the most grave expression I have seen to this day. At that point I started to cry, scared for my life and the well-being of my family. I thought God hated me and had abandoned my soul to be tormented by the Devil. But what Father Tom said to me next has never left my mind: ""Child, you are in danger. There is something in that house that wants to claim you, to take you from God and from this world. You're right to be frightened. These beings want nothing but evil, and will go to any lengths to see that it's done. But listen to me. You are a child of God. You were born and raised in this church, in the eyes and heart of whatever God you believe in. The only power this creature has over you is that which you give it. Fear is what drives them, what feeds them. Eliminate your fear and they have no power over you. The darkness can only touch you if you let it in. Trust in God an your own strength and you will be protected."" He paused for a moment, clearly thinking deeply about something. When he looked up that loving smile had returned, much to my relief. ""But let me give you something that might make that a bit easier.""

He disappeared into one of the back rooms of the church and returned with a small box. When I opened it I found the most beautiful rosary of glass beads and silver that I had ever seen. He said, ""This rosary was handmade in Guatemala and blessed by the Pope himself. Monsignor brought several of them back from his trip to Rome for myself and the other Priests, but I think you need this a bit more than I do."" He smiled and took my hand, ""I'll pray for you tonight, and be sure to come back and let me know if you need any more help."" He blessed me, and I returned home.

I keep that rosary hung on the wall above my bed, and I've never again been disturbed in the night. I've since moved away to go to school, but after I hung that rosary I started sleeping normally again and was no longer afraid to be in my own house. My dog even started sleeping in my room again.

Make of this what you will. Maybe it was just my imagination and the whispers stopped because I believed they would. Maybe I'm crazy and paranoid. Maybe my mind was simply playing tricks on me...but maybe not. I'm certainly not about to start asking questions. All I know is the whispers are gone. And that's how I intend to keep it.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_xdepx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/xdepx/whispers_in_the_night_xpost_from_rnosleep_comment/,

Despite the unremarkable setting, we were both positive it was haunted.  There were a lot of stories me and her pass back and forth to this day about what we experienced there, but most of them can be chalked up to us being overly imaginative kids.  I guess this story could just as easily fall under that latter category, but I still find it chilling because a) I was partially involved and b) the experience was extremely out of character for my sister.  This is essentially how she told it to me:

""I was lying in bed, looking at the ceiling-stucco because I couldn't sleep.  At the time, it was pretty normal for me to be too afraid to fall asleep... you remember, the dolls always creeped me out and I thought there was a skeleton in the hallway (laughs).  

So, lying in bed I hear oma [grandma] and opa [grandfather] talking downstairs.  I think nothing of getting out of bed and going to the basement to see them.  They usually brought chocolates so... you know, I was a fat kid.

I clutch the bannister and go downstairs without even thinking to turn the lights on.  I still heard their voices, so I guess that's why I didn't feel afraid.  When I got to the bottom of the stairs though, I was surprised that the voices were coming from the laundry/junk room and not the living room.  Actually, the door to the laundry room was even open a little.""

Commentary: I used to have reoccurring nightmares about the laundry room. It'd be simple - a woman's silhouette would walk slowly out of it and find me, no matter where I chose to hide.  The door also would open and close on its own (the handle actually had to turn for it to open).  That being said, my sister and I were pretty scared of it, which makes the rest of her behavior even more unusual.

""I went inside the room and it was dark, obviously.  I could just hear opa's voice now and it was coming from behind that black curtain that used to partition the junk room.  I was getting nervous at this point [she usually tears up when she tells me about this part] but still wanted to see opa, so I went towards the curtain.  They were slightly parted and when I peered inside there was this black shadow - which is must have been REALLY black for me to see it in the already dark basement - and it sort of slipped from the floor to the ceiling.  Then this face appeared really high above me looking between the cracks.  No body, just the face.  I looked up and... it looked like opa almost, only the face was distorted.  It was looking down at me with very small but bright eyes, a wide lip-less grin and no nose [to me this sounded almost like 'The Thing' from those ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" books.]  I started crying and ran upstairs.""

I remember this last part myself. Being four years her senior, I was still awake, but I had been playing alone in my room at the time.  She ran into my room and cried at me, but wouldn't tell me what she saw.  I'm pretty sure we decided to share my bed that night.  It was years later before she told me anything that happened.

It's possible she was sleep-walking and snapped out of it when she saw the face in her dream. I used to sleep-walk and pace the basement stairs myself.  Still, that story always scared me.

TL;DR - Sister thought she heard grandfather in basement, saw deformed version of him, then ran away.  ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_x90up,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/x90up/fam_face_in_basement/,

Its not something that is a regular occurrence but when it happens once then it tends to stay with me for a couple weeks.
When it happens its in the middle of the night. I get woken up and all is normal until I realise I can hardly breath, nor can I move any part of my body. I can make noises, although these come out very quiet and no words will form, just grunts.
I'm fully awake and can see and hear everything around me.
The paralysis will last anything from a few seconds to over a minute. I know that doesn't sound long but trust me being pinned in one position unable to move or breath is terrifying. 
I found out that if I'm able to move one body part then the spell is broken and I can move and breath fine. So I tend to focus on on body part, usually my leg and try to move it.
After one of these episodes I need to get out of bed and stretch. If I dont do this then I slip back into paralysis again. This is actual worse than waking up paralysed because I can feel my chest tightening and my body start to shake until I'm back under and unable to move.
I did look into it online to see if it was some kind of common condition and came across something called 'Old Hag Syndrome'. This is described in exactly the same way that I've stated above except that a lot of other people that experience it also see an old woman in the room that makes her way slowly towards the paralysed person before climbing on top and crushing their chest.
Now I never experienced anything like this or anything that I couldn't explain. That was until two nights ago when I had another episode.
It was around 4am when I woke up. I don't know what woke me but I was wide awake. I tried to turn my head to see if maybe my cat had jumped up on the bed but I was unable to move. That's when I felt my chest getting heavy.
I knew what I had to do and I focused all my energy on kicking my leg. That's when I heard it.
I live in a two storey house and the stairs to the second floor run next to my bedroom. I heard the door downstairs open, this door jams so you need to give it a good push so I know that my cat nor the wind could have opened it.
A few seconds after I heard the door open I heard a footstep on the first step and then another step and another. It sounded slow to me, like the 'person' climbing the stairs could only go one step at a time, much like an elderly person.
I hoped that this was my wife (shes not elderly!), who tended to stay up later than me watching TV but I could feel her body heat next to me.
The footsteps continued very slowly until I heard the floorboard creak outside the bedroom door.
The bedroom door is also quite stiff but I heard it push open.
My cat in the bedroom started to chatter softly, the same kind of noise she makes when shes unsure about something. 
I couldn't see what opened the door because my back was to it and I was unable to move.
I started to panic now and tried desperately to make a noise or kick out to alert my wife that something was wrong. I felt like I was in a suit made of lead. Everything was to heavy and was taking a lot out of me.
I could then hear footsteps making its way slowly around the room towards my side of the bed. My cat is now hissing and letting out a very low growl.
I can see a slight shadow pass the window close to my bed, no real definition to it although it was small in size.
That's when I was able to shout out and wake up my wife. Everything went back to normal in the room except that I was covered in sweat and gasping for breath.
I tried to explain it to my wife but she explained it away by saying it was a nightmare. She has never had a problem with sleep and when I try and explain it to her she doesn't quite understand.
She couldn't explain why both the bedroom door and lounge door were open though. Or why our cat was cowering under the bed, like she does when shes hear fireworks.
Everything I said above is 100% true. This was the first time that anything unexplained happened to me during one of these episodes and I hope to never have to go through it again.

[ME],Mcready,41,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ucmd2/lost_and_mysteriously_found_me/,"I posted this  ages ago on no sleep I think, just discovered this excellent Reddit which contains all those real stories I used to trawl no sleep for! More bizarre much more paranormal experiences to follow, this is one of the more lighter things that have occured to me over the years! The following event  sticks in my mind as clear as day!

When I was about 6 I had something odd happen. I had been playing with my Star Wars figures and could not find the hat for my Lando Calrissian figure (first world problem right there!). It was the one where he's in disguise as a guard in Jabbas palace in ROTJ. I spent all day looking everywhere for it , in the garden, the living room, turned my whole room upside down, couldnt find it anywhere. I was really upset and unhappy about this because I had only recently got that figure.

I lived with my grand parents and that evening we all got in the car to go and visit my Mum who had just moved into a new house. I didnt really see my Mum at all so this was exciting. So we get to this house that I have never been to before and like any normal kid, I start to explore. Eventually I make it into the back garden and there the weirdness begins.

Looking around the garden, there are little stone steps that lead up from a patio to the actual garden. For reasons I cannot explain, I sat down opposite the steps and looked at them. I felt the strange urge to touch the steps and as I did, I noticed one of the stone bricks under the step was loose.

So, I pull the lose stone out and discover that behind it is an empty black space. Cautionsly, I put my hand inside, aware that spiders may well be lurking and my hand touches something small and round which I grab.

I open my hand and there it is. A perfectly new Lando Calrissian hat just like the one I had been looking for all day, myteriously hidden behind a stone brick in the garden of a house I had never been to before!

I got home and with great glee gave Lando his hat. His disguise was once again complete!

Nobody believes this story because it makes absolutely no sense at all!

The area has a rule where there are no street lights, telephone poles, or parking in the street allowed so it makes you feel fairly isolated. It also means there are a lot of trees as most of the area is still vacant. 

I have three large dogs that sometimes wake me up in the middle of the night to be let out. My husband and I take turns getting up with them, and lately I've been trying to get out of my turn due to a grove of trees across the street. 

Its a collection of very, very large trees with no homes behind or around it making it insanely dark at night. However, on nights with a full moon the entire area looks pretty illuminated by a silvery light, but it also deepens shadows cast by anything as it's not quite as bright as the sun would be. Last week's full moon brought with something new I don't know what to make of.

It was around 2 AM when the dogs and I were outside when my oldest ran for the edge of our yard where he stood barking like he was on the verge of killing something. The other two joined him after a minute and while they seemed a lot more nervous than him, were barking in an equally vicious manner. I assumed they had spotted deer or a fox in spite of the fact that they don't normally bark like that at the various woodland creatures who live near us. I started to walk to them in order to tell them to stop and bring them in when I noticed there was something off about the animal they were barking at. Namely, I didn't know of a single animal it could of been.

It was bipedal whatever it was, standing with a noteworthy slouch huddling near the base of the trees staring at the dogs and at me. It made no noise at all, but watched us with the same sort of reflective eyes all animals have in the dark. The light of the moon was bouncing off of them, but it was close enough to the tree I couldn't make much out. What I could make out was it stood around six feet, with the hunch, and if it had fur it was very little and close to it's skin. In a panic, I ran to my front door and called my husband. He came to the door, holding a gun and pulled me in the house teling me to stay put.

He and the dogs came in a short time later, his face a little drawn. He'd gone across the street to look at the trees himself due to the dogs' barking more than my panic and although he never saw what we had seen, he did find a deer that looked like something had killed and started eating it. He insists it must of been coyotes, which would of made the dogs bark as well.

The very first and most memorable happened when I was 8.

My father and his girlfriend had lived in a tiny one bedroom apartment for a while, and stuff would happen that would give me the willies, mostly just a feeling of being watched, and one night, i could swear I felt something grab my head, but nothing was there.  I shared a room with three brothers, one was my 4 year old step brother, my twin brother, who slept on the lower level of a bunk bed, right under me, and my older brother, a year older than me, with his own bed.  The way my bed was set up,  was so that it was pointing towards a closet.  We always left the door open, never hand a reason to not.  My twin brother had somehow gotten a splinter in his hand, i believe from the bed, and my father had gone with him into the adjacent bathroom, which was off to my left, on the other side of the room.  My stepmom was still in bed, and my older brother was too, and my step brother was at his dad's house.  I looked at the bathroom door, with a small sliver of light coming out from under it, and back to the foot of my bed, and saw a face, a man, about 6'4, the height I am now, 14 years later, standing at the foot of my bed, I looked back at the door, and started screaming for my dad, ""HEEEEELLLLP! DADDY! THERE'S SOMEBODY HERE AT THE FOOT OF MY BED!!! HELP HELP! AHHHH!"" and he said it was all my imagination.  But the person/image didn't go away, it stayed there, standing, staring, it's eyes had a sort of glow where the pupils were.  I was utterly freaked out.  When my dad finally opened the bathroom door with the light on, it disappeared, and I never saw it again, and my older brother didn't see anything there when he looked over, he had no clue why I was freaking out.  

I found out, about 6 years ago though, My father had seen a man who matched that description, occasionally pacing through the house, shuffling papers on the desk.  The man never looked quite solid to my dad, but was never threatening.

I've only had one paranormal experience that in my entire life that I remember. Here we go.

There is one memory I have as a child that really sticks out to me the most. While I understand that memories can get slightly skewed over the years, it's so fresh in my head, it feels like it just happened to me yesterday.

I was around 5 years old and I shared a bedroom with my triplet sisters, Chels and Erica.  There were 3 windows in the room, 2 that looked out over our driveway, and 1 that looked out over our back yard.  Our backyard is fairly large, fenced in, and completely surrounded by pine trees, but  behind it lies a big soybean field. 

I couldn't tell you what time it was, because I was fucking 5. I couldn't pour myself a bowl of cereal let alone understand the concept of time.
But, I remember Chels and I waking up at the same time and just nonchalantly navigating towards the window that looks over the back yard. I don't even know why we woke up, or why we walked to the window. I remember just *doing* it. Simply as that. 

Our bedroom was on the ground floor, so the the window was relatively close the floor of the room. We were both sitting on our knees, with our hands on the window pane peering out into the yard.

What we see hoovering over the yard is fucking huge, and it's hovering just level with the roof of my house. Now maybe it's my stupid 5 year old head that's making it bigger than it actually is, but it seems just absolutely gigantic for being so close to the ground. I would compare it to the size of a recreational softball field. 

It quite honestly looked like your classic UFO saucer shape, but it had these lights that flashed all around it. These crazy, beautiful colorful lights.  It looked almost like LED Christmas lights that alternate color, except 100 times bigger and just so bright.  I don't even remember being scared, I remember being amazed and how it reminded me of a giant Litebrite in the sky. Fuck, you guys, Litebrites were the shit.


Along with the colored lights flashing all around it, it was swinging back and forth, in very slight ""U"" shape. Just back and forth, back and forth, but never quite following the same path. Sometimes it would dip just a little lower, or a little higher. Or go just a tiny bit further to the left, or a tiny bit further to the right, but remained in the same general area. It stayed there until the realization both hit us that this wasn't normal.

We ran into our parents bedrooms, but by the time we got back to the window it was gone.  They wrote it off as us being irrational 5 year olds, and tucked us back into bed.

Now, I know this wasn't just a dream, because Chels and I discussed what we saw years after the fact. Once we we teenagers she didn't want to talk about it, and got a little scared whenever I brought it up. Today, she says she doesn't remember it at all, which honestly I don't understand, because it's so fresh and clear in my head.

The fact that all the sudden she ""doesn't remember"" is the only part that makes me worried that I've had this very real story in my head that I've been telling friends about for years and years that isn't even true, and my mind just created this whole detailed story on it's own. But, I stand by what I saw, and I genuinely believe that I *did* see *something*, but let me know what ya'll think.

After being on reddit a bit longer, it's clear how much fiction is on /r/nosleep, so I think my experiences are better shared here).

After a couple weeks of lurking here, I decided to get an account and share my experiences. Let me start by saying that I’m not yet sold on the idea of ghosts, and I don’t consider myself to be particularly “sensitive” to the paranormal. As a photographer, I’ve been to nearly a dozen abandoned hospitals along the East Coast, and I’ve have never seen or felt anything spooky there, even when I explored old morgues or when the particular hospital had a well-documented history of its patients having suffered or undergone abuse. The only place I’ve been scared like this is my family home.

For me, it started in Spring 2001, when I was dating a girl who I will refer to as “(T).”* One night, she slept over with me in the upstairs guest bedroom when no one else was home. In complete darkness, I awoke to the sound of screaming. I had been dreaming (?) that I had been conversing with the voice of an elderly woman, and as we continued to speak, the woman’s voice had become increasingly menacing. When I first heard the screams, I associated them with the old woman and was terrified. As my surroundings began to become clearer to me, I began to understand that the screaming was coming from my girlfriend beside me. I nudged her and repeatedly identified myself to her to try to get her to stop. I then made a blind dash for the light switch and turned on the ceiling light. We stared at each other in fear. She started to say something, and I pointed at her and told her to be quiet and not to move. I was so terrified that something else was in the room with us, that I felt I needed to limit all our sound and movement until I could figure out what and where the other presence could be. Another wave of fear came over me as the crazy thought crossed my mind that the presence could have entered her. I wasn’t ready to trust her until I could see nothing was going to happen. After what seemed like an endless silence, we began to talk. She could only say that she did not remember screaming, but that she had felt very afraid when I woke her up. We slept on the floor of the living room for the rest of the night.

Looking back on my time with (T), there were two other smaller occurrences that also spooked me. Prior to the guest room incident, we were at her place one night and I was staring out at the city through an open window. All of a sudden, I got the strange feeling that something nefarious was making its way to me from a long way away. I hadn’t experienced that feeling before, and I haven’t had it since. On another night, she and I were pulling her car away from my house when we looked over our shoulders and spotted a dark mass moving across the front of the hedges. It was larger than a person, but had no definite shape, and its movement was too smooth to be anything I would normally encounter.

(T) and I broke up at the end of the summer, and I was soon dating a girl who I will refer to as “(E).” I had begun to sleep in the basement of the house, and (E) stayed over most nights. The bedroom area is adjoined (without a wall) to a small den that has a couch, chairs, and wall shelving for books. On occasion, I was startled by strange sounds in the basement and would peer out into the darkness and try to use any available ambient light source to help me look around the room. Across the room, on a shelf near the books, there has always been a rectangular clock with a digital face. It has an orange exterior, and it looks like something that came out of the 1970s. As the minutes pass, the digits make their transition with a “melting” effect. One night, I looked over to the clock and saw darkness move across its face as if someone or something had stepped in front of it. It could have been as many as thirty seconds before the darkness moved off of it and I could see it again. Another night, I dreamt that there was a doorway behind the wall that holds the bookshelves and the clock. I remember being afraid of what could be behind that door.

One evening, (E) and her best friend (B) were over at my house and they had brought along a Ouija board to mess around with. I’m not sure whose idea it was, but I have to laugh a little now because it illustrates my conflicted thought process at the time—“Sure, I’ve experienced some pretty spooky things here, and the Ouija board is probably not a good idea, but I’ve never played with one before, and it sounds like fun. Besides, I am supposed to be the skeptic.” We turned off the living room lights and began to ask the Ouija about the house. We didn’t really get any tangible responses, and the answers seemed to gravitate toward the numbers of the board far more than the letters. Finally, (B) spoke up and said, “I’m starting to get a little scared, will someone turn on the light?” Whether it was to project the appearance of bravery in front of two girls or simply out of sheer laziness (or both), I replied, “Whoever wants the light to be on should turn the light on.” No sooner had the words left my mouth when the living room light spontaneously came on for two seconds before going dark again.

Things soon escalated. There were early mornings in which I would wake to find myself with my hand close to (E)’s throat, while simultaneously drawing an audible, scared breath, as if I had been fighting off an attacker in my sleep. Yet, I could remember no dream preceding it.

Lying in the bed with me one night in the dark, (E) felt a weight on top of her and assumed that I had rolled over to lie on her. After the weight lifted, she discovered, to her horror that I had been asleep the whole time and had not been close enough to her on the bed to roll over on her.

On another occasion, she awoke in the middle of the night to tell me she had just had a nightmare. In the dream, there was a young woman in the house. The woman was terrified, and when she opened her mouth to scream, there was no sound, hauntingly revealing a bird inside her mouth, franticly flapping its wings.

My relationship with (E) did not survive, and a lot of that had to do with infidelity on my part, including a relationship with her friend, (B), who I had mentioned above during the description of the Ouija Board incident.

Somewhere along the line, I re-watched David Lynch’s, “Lost Highway,” a film I hadn’t seen since it came out in 1997. My jaw dropped as I listened to the conversation between the Mystery Man (Robert Blake) and Fred (Bill Pullman) at the party. Following the Mystery Man’s claim that they met before at Fred’s house, he makes the impossible claim that he is also “there right now.” He asks Fred to call him there, and when the mystery man picks up, Fred asks how he got inside his house. The Mystery Man cryptically explains, “You invited me. It is not my custom to go where I am not wanted.” The scene gave me a chill, as it suddenly sunk in that it may have been my personal turmoil that contributed to “inviting” what I had experienced. The movie put my impression that the presence could “get inside of you” in a new light. It also made me remember a dream I had in which I was walking though the hallway of an apartment complex. I knocked on a door, and a woman let me in. I then saw myself in another hallway in the complex, with another woman opening the door to let me in. As this pattern was repeated, I got the sense that someone or something was following me through the hallways and was getting a little closer each time I entered a new door. I approached the last door, knowing that if I entered, the thing I feared would finally catch up with me. It was then that I awoke from the dream.

In 2005, I moved 1,800 miles away to the East Coast. I met my wife, and we eventually moved back to my hometown in 2010, when I received a job offer I could not refuse. We are now temporarily staying in my family home again after the sale of my own house, before we moved to Canada (where my wife is originally from). We are staying in the upstairs guest bedroom (where the experience with (T) above happened), and we haven’t experienced anything spooky so far. However, I try to spend as little time as possible in the basement.
I still don’t know what to think about what I experienced. As I mentioned above, I am still not yet sold on the idea of a ghost. The dark shape that I saw never really took a form that reminded me of a person, living or dead. Whatever it was that I saw and experienced, I can’t help but think that the turmoil that I brought into the house at the time (cheating on my girlfriends, etc.) only magnified its presence.

My sister, who has lived at the house on and off over the years, has had experiences of her own. One of hers even predates my first one by a couple of years. She was sleeping in the upstairs guest bedroom when she felt something grab her leg. She was terrified, and wanted to call out to my mother who was sleeping in a nearby bedroom. But, all of a sudden, she got this horrible feeling/knowledge that the thing that had grabbed her leg actually wanted her to call out to my mother, so that it could get to her as well. Unwilling to call out, my sister lay petrified in silence until she forced herself to move again.

In preparing to summarize these events, I called my sister yesterday and asked about any other experiences she had with the house. The first thing she said to me was, “Don’t stare at the clock. It will disappear.” I knew what clock she was talking about, but I asked her more about it, anyway, to make sure I got the full, independent account of what she had experienced. She said that both she and a boyfriend of hers had slept in the basement and the clock had disappeared into the darkness for them. She said that the wall behind the clock is a “portal,” but she does not know to what. She is less of a skeptic than me, and considers herself “sensitive” to things that are paranormal. She does entertain the notion of ghosts and claims that she actually had a positive paranormal experience while in the house during the time that she was grieving for the loss of my grandmother (not the same grandmother who previously owned this house)**. Her positive experience was tied to a specific person, and was very different from the frightening experiences in the house, so she considers them completely unrelated. She agrees that the presence seems magnified by any turmoil she is experiencing in her life. She says she has even experienced the tactile sensation of something poking her while she attempted to sleep on the couch in the basement. She felt it was a “taunting” move by the presence.

*A note about (T): Relatively early in our relationship, she told me that she and her mother were “followed” by ghosts. As a young woman growing up on a rural farm, her mother had come across the body of a man who had committed suicide by shooting himself on their property. Since that time, her mother had experienced encounters with a presence, and my girlfriend talked about it like it was only natural that the presence would also reveal itself to her. (T) claimed her best friend had witnessed one of these encounters, when the shape of a man had protruded from the wall of her apartment. The most specific thing she could say about the man was that he appeared to be wearing a suit.

As some of my sister’s experiences predate my relationship with (T) and as the experiences continued after I broke up with (T), there doesn’t appear to be any clean way to link her personal history to the house.

**Notes about the house: My mom’s parents bought the house when my mother was 19 and away at college. My grandparents continued to live here until each required nursing home assistance prior to their deaths. My mother has lived here since a few years before my grandmother died, following the divorce of my parents. I never lived in this house as a child, I have only come to stay here as a young adult when I was in transition from college or moving to another place. I do not feel in any way that the experiences in the house have anything to do with my deceased grandparents. As far as the house’s history before my grandparents is concerned, my mother had always thought there had been only one previous owner. She said that there was a man, his wife, and a young child who lived her for about 7 years. She explained that she had learned that, years later, the man had been struck and killed by a passing car.

However, it turns out there was another owner before this man. Just yesterday, (I am not making any of this up), we met a former occupant of the house for the first time. I was using the downstairs bathroom when my mom spotted a middle-aged woman taking a picture of the house from the front lawn. The woman explained that she now lives in California, but she had spent the first few years of her life in this house with her brother and parents, the original owners. She had stayed here until early elementary school, before she was “sent to California,” away from her family. He father had then died, which had resulted in “everything getting screwed up, even worse,” but she didn’t explain more than that. My mother had let her in, and she politely asked if she could see the upstairs bedrooms. She peered into the guest room. She then asked about the basement. As the basement isn’t well organized right now, my mom used the excuse that I was downstairs to dissuade her from going down there. When I came up the stairs, I heard her telling my mom one of her memories from her childhood. She said they had a “magic television.” Her brother would ask her to sit down on the couch and “think really hard” to change the channel. She was always amazed that the channel would eventually change, but she had later suspected that her brother must have actually had one of the early, corded remote controls and must have hidden the cord from her and changed the channels. My mom asked if our visitor would sit down and stay a little longer, but she declined. She had tears in her eyes, and while it was obvious that she was emotional, I couldn’t tell if she was experiencing happiness, sadness, or some other emotion at seeing the house again.

The house is located at the top of a hill that is between two valleys, so you can see quite a ways even though it's not the high.

It was night and I was looking off of one side around an area were a cell phone tower can normally been seen. From that direction I see a flashing blue light. At first I thought that the colour of the cell tower's light had been changed from red to blue, but I soon saw that the light was getting close with each blink!

Each time it blinked it looked like it would teleport about 100 ft. It had a blinking interval slower than the cell tower, but a smiler brighten and fade rate. Soon it wasn't over the valley anymore and was coming low over the hill with a constant vector. At this point I alert my mom to the thing coming closer. 
She sees it and at this point it is about three houses down and was coming through my neighbours yards parallel to the street; clearing about a yard per blink, so maybe not covering as much distance between blinks at this point. We never saw a main body or something emitting the light. It was like a disembodied light was just appearing and each time and moving closer and closer.

The last time we see the whole thing it flashed about 50 ft away and about 10 ft off the ground, at the end of our yard. My Mom and I are freaked out and discuss going inside, just then the thing flashes just around the corner of our house about 7 ft off the deck, it was very bright and illuminated the deck even from around the house, like we can just see the edge of it. We book it inside, but never see the thing again.

It left no evidence. I looked around the area it where had flashed to see if had done anything to the house, because the house had been in the things ""path"" and had teleported ""through"" it, but found nothing.

We talk about it once a year to keep our memories fresh, but have never altered or added to our story. I've tried to come up with some explanations such as ball lightning or a small aircraft of some kind but nothing fits.

In Oklahoma (about halfway between Oklahoma City and Amarillo, TX), he stopped the car on the side of the highway and saw a metallic disk-shaped craft hovering nearly overhead, and another one about a quarter mile away. They both stood there and watched it, and after a short time it turned onto its side, so they could see the top of the craft, on which there was a symbol like a swastika combined with a trident. Both discs then shot off into the sky at high speed, disappearing within seconds. A few minutes later, a military jet flew overhead, heading in the direction that they had gone.

His friend was pretty shaken up by this, as he didn't believe such things were possible, but they got back in the car and drove on. That night they were driving near Grants, NM, when they stopped the car at the side of the road again. They noticed a couple of people walking toward them, wearing all white. As they got closer, he noticed that they didn't seem human. They were about 5 feet tall, and the proportions and the way they moved was wrong. As they got closer, he could see that they had huge ""eyes"" but no nose or mouth, and looked similar to the typical 'grey alien' face. They came close enough that he could see that it wasn't really their faces, but helmets, and the ""eyes"" were tinted windows in the helmets. He shouted to his friend to get back in the car, he saw a bright blue light outside the car and one of the ""aliens"" peering into the window, and the next thing he knew he was driving again, and the same few seconds of a song (""The Beat Goes On"") were repeating over and over on the radio. He later decided that the repeating song was probably something implanted in his memory to cover the missing time. He slowly came out of the dreamlike state he was in and found that they were now near Holbrook, AZ, some distance down the highway. His friend was terrified and wouldn't talk about what happened until decades later, but one memory came back to my father in law from the missing time:

He was lying on an examination bed in a largish round room while several human-looking beings worked at some consoles at the edge of the room nearby. He said they would easily pass for human if you saw them in the street, but their faces looked ""beautiful"" or ""angelic"". They were wearing bright colors. They didn't speak, but he got an impression of what they were communicating to each other. He said he felt like he understood it because he is an artist and thinks in images. What they ""said"" went something like this:

""He's awake.""

""It's ok, he won't remember anything.""

""This one is different. He will remember.""

And then nothing. When he tries to recall anything else from that time, there's only a few images of a Mesozoic world. He thinks they put him to sleep at that point and made him dream to cover up his memories.

1325913354.0,36,self.Thetruthishere,o6fi8,[FAM] The House on Edgerton Road,annuvin,38,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/o6fi8/fam_the_house_on_edgerton_road/,"Sorry about the x-post, but I think this collection belongs here rather than in \nosleep.  100% true as my cousin and Lenny related to me...

My cousin has lived in a 165 year old farmhouse for the better part of 30 years that can only be described as 'haunted as fuck'. I mean this in the most sincerest sense... One could make a movie about her experiences living there and it would be far more disturbing than anything Hollywood has put out in recent memory. The house is an old style farmhouse consisting of a dirt-floor basement, a first floor split between a kitchen, a living room, a small bathroom and laundry room. The second floor had four bedrooms and a converted sunroom that my cousin used for sewing and crafts.

To begin with, my cousin did not buy this house. It was owned by her first husband Ed, who died after slipping on some ice and breaking his neck on the property. Ed was a nice guy but he had a bit of a drinking problem. One night shortly after my cousin moved in, she woke up to the sound of Ed having quite an animated converstion with someone in the kitchen. As she came downstairs it became apparent that the conversation Ed was having was somewhat one-sided; Ed would speak or ask a question but no one would answer. A moment later Ed would resume talking as if someone had replied to him. 

As she entered the kitchen, she found Ed piss-loaded drunk at the kitchen table facing two vacant chairs on the other side of it. He was still asking questions, and seemingly getting replies that only he could hear. My cousin stood in the kitchen doorway watching for a while before asking, ""Ed, who in the hell are you talking to?""

Ed turned and replied. ""The two ghosts. Can't you see them?"" He pointed to the two chairs. ""There's a big one sitting there and a little one sitting there.""

My cousin, thinking Ed was suffering delerium tremens or some other alcohol-induced madness, simply replied, ""well keep it down for god's sake. You woke me up."" 

At this time, my cousin was unaware that the place was spooked. In retrospect, she did recall one disturbing question Ed had asked the spirits: ""When did you get out of the nuthouse?""

                           *          *          *
After that night, she began to notice weird things happening around the house. A common occurance was hearing Ed call her name but he would deny calling her when asked. They both reported footsteps and stomping above them when nobody was upstairs, and she also began to experience what she decribed as ""someone jumping out at you"" when you came around a corner. She stated she felt exactly as if somebody was hiding around a corner that would jump in her face to try to scare her, but nobody would be there. Her and Ed also sensed that there was the spirit of a woman sitting on a bench and looking out the window at the end of the upstairs hallway. 

In the summertime, they kept a radio on in the kitchen when they sat out on the back porch. The radio was an old-school one with an analogue dial tuner and it was up on a high shelf above the kitchen table. On more than one occasion, the radio would start randomly changing stations as if somebody was playing with the tuning dial. This would stop the moment anyone stuck their head in the kitchen, yet would resume as soon as they sat back down on the porch.

                           *          *          *
After Ed passed away, my cousin met her current husband, Lenny. After Lenny moved in things started to get even weirder. They had a dog, Rizzo, that would look into empty rooms and wag its tail like it saw somebody it new. Other times, Rizzo would be upstairs and they would hear its ball being thrown against the wall. They would then hear Rizzo chase the ball, only to hear the ball be thrown against the opposite wall for him to chase. When they looked upstairs later, the ball would be found in a place that wasn't normal for a dog to leave it (like shoved down the side of the couch, for example).

Another time, my cousin had a friend over and they were discussing the general weirdness of the place. Her friend had brought a guy my cousin had never met before that claimed to have psychic abilities. After hearing several stories about the place, he suddenly walked outside and pointed at the back lawn.

""You used to have a barn here,"" he stated. 

My cousin replied that there never was one to her knowledge, but he kept insisting. ""Yes! There was a barn here. Something terrible happened in it, too. Whatever it was, it started in the barn and finished in the basement.""

He then asked to leave as he was visibly shaken. Later when digging up the back lawn to install a fountain, the remains of a large, previously unknown structure were found there. My cousin has been afraid to dig up the basement floor ever since.

                           *          *          *
When my cousin and Lenny wanted to have kids, the decision was made to renovate much of the old house. During this time weird occurances became the everyday norm: footsteps, bangings, voices, misplaced items and general poltergeist-type activity. As these types of things became commonplace they started to seem less out of the ordinary. ""There was a time,"" Lenny told me, ""when it only seemed weird if something didn't happen for a week."" However, one day my cousin came home to find Lenny on the back porch chainsmoking and visibly shaken. She had gone to town while he was alone in the house doing some renovations in what would later be the kids' rooms. He told my cousin he suddenly heard what sounded exactly like someone throwing ""a body"" around the house. The ""body"" was banging into the walls and floor, shaking the house. It freaked him out so bad he stayed outside until my cousin returned home.

One night, Lenny went into the kitchen to get a piece of cheesecake my cousin made for dinner. The kitchen has a pantry off to one side (opposite the living room) that was large enough for both a boot closet along with all their dry and canned goods. While Lenny was rooting around the fridge looking for the cheesecake, he saw my cousin walk out of the living room and into the pantry, turning the pantry light on in the process. Having trouble finding the cheesecake, he called my cousin.

""What?"" she asked as she walked in from the living room.

Lenny spun around to the pantry, confused. There was nobody in the pantry but the pantry light was still on. He told me later he wasn't really hungry for cheesecake after that.

                           *          *          *
When my cousin was pregnant with her son, she still insisted on helping with the usual chores around the farm. Lenny had baled up the alfalfa field and she was driving the tractor as he was loading the bales on the haywagon. They were working for a while when they noticed Lenny's parents pull in. After a moment they walked up to the house, but just stood there as if they were confused. Lenny walked back to the house and asked what was wrong. They told him they thought my cousin was being rude to them. 

""What do you mean?"" asked Lenny.

His mother explained that they drove up and saw my cousin in the sunroom window. She had waved down to them like she was coming to greet them, but never came down or opened the door.

""I don't know who you think you saw up there,"" said Lenny. ""But we are both out in the field bringing the hay in and there is nobody at all in the house right now.""

                           *          *          *
When their daughter was around four, Lenny and my cousin were up watching TV one night while the kids were in bed. Suddenly there was a vicious slam like someone had tried to rip their daughter's bedroom door right through the frame, aand at the same time their daughter started screaming bloody murder. Lenny ran up the stairs two at a time and found the daughter's bedroom door closed. He grabbed the doorknob but the door seemed stuck fast in its frame. He put his shoulder into it and forced the door open. As they entered the room, they found their daughter sitting up in bed still screaming with her face as white as a ghost. Lenny tried to comfort her but she was in hysterics. After finally calming her down, Lenny asked what had happened.

""I saw a monster,"" she said between sobs. ""A scary monster with two tails.""

It was years before she would sleep alone in that room again, opting instead to sleep on her brother's top bunk until she was almost 10.

                           *          *          *
My cousin is pretty insistant on keeping lights turned off when not in use to keep the electric bill low. Coming back from my aunt's house one winter night, they passed a gully on Edgerton where they can see the farmhouse clear across the valley. After they come up over the ridge, they can't see the house again until they pull down the driveway. As they passed the gully they could all see the house lit up like a Christmas tree in the distance. It appeared that every light in the house had been left on when they left. My cousin, who had insisted that all the lights be checked when they left hours earlier, lost her temper and turned around to give the kids hell about it. She was still lecturing them as they turned off Edgerton and on to the driveway.

""You can stop that now,"" said Lenny.

My cousin, who is not one to give quarter easily, quickly turned around to face Lenny when she suddenly stopped. The house lay at the bottom of the driveway in total darkness with not a single light bulb burning within.

""See mommy,"" whispered her son. ""We told you we didn't leave the lights on.""

                           *          *          *
My cousin and some friends of hers decided one weekend to have a psychic party at the old farmhouse. They ended up hiring a local psychic who is somewhat famous in that part of Ontario. When my cousin's turn came up, the old woman told her that Ed was still with her and wanted her to be happy with Lenny. She continued the reading and when she was finished, my cousin told her there were a few things she wanted to ask about the house.

""Yes,"" said the psychic before my cousin could continue. ""There are two ghosts here. A woman and an young child. They stay here because they like this house and because they like you. They will bring you no harm.""

     She explained that its something that the women in her family do on a regular basis. I asked her if she knew how to turn it on and off, she says she doesn't know how, but her mom and grandma tend to ""call"" whenever they pleased. Her sister doesn't have the ability to do this at all. 

     In addition to this, she also has premonitions, and she hates that she has to tell people that fucked up things are gonna happen to them cause she doesn't want to be the one to bring bad news. Her Mom also has premonitions but only when a death is about to happen. 

     Also, She broke the news that she sees ""Shadow People"" on a regular basis, and that last nights phone call was from her grandma asking her if she felt safe in my room where she heard, felt, and saw a shadow person. Somehow Grandma seems to know what my GF is  experiencing at all times.

I live in Lancashire, England, a county known for being one of the most haunted in England, and while I am fairly superstitious and open to the unusual, my family tend not to be. Which makes their experiences in some ways more credible as they will admit to them being ""creepy"" but flat out refuse to refer to them as paranormal. Still, my whole family on my mother's side has at least an experience each to tell, so in my opinion my family are fairly sensitive. Some of the sound very unbelievable but I swear that they have been told/corroborated by various family members who DO NOT believe in ghosts.

My grandfather - was an electrician and took care of an elderly woman's home in the 1970s, let himself in with his key to her cottage one day and went down to the cellar to do whatever it was he usually did. Thought it was a little odd that she didn't greet him with a cup of tea but that she might have gone out with a coach group or something (that's why he had a key, anyway). When he was working, the door at the top of the stairs opened a little and a slipper came hurtling down them. He later found out from her son (who lived down south and so wasn't usually around/in contact with my grandfather) that she had fallen down stairs and died earlier that week. 

My uncle - was about three or four, old enough to talk but not old enough to really be aware of horror tropes/legends/the like to have fabricated this story. He used to stay in my great grandmother's cottage sometimes so my grandparents could go out, and often chatted to her over breakfast about the grey lady 'taking him for a ride' to the ceiling. Being an old, superstitious northern woman, after this story cropped up a few times she became worried and decided to go into his room once he was asleep and keep watch. After sleeping peacefully for hours, my uncle sat bolt upright and said to my great grandmother ""Grandma, she says she won't come if you're here"". 
(That one is my favourite family story).

My uncle and mother - as teenagers lived in a one storey house with a completely walled back garden - inaccessible except for through the house. Their bedrooms backed on to this garden, yet they often both heard footsteps running past their windows at the same time of night. They swear it sounded like someone wearing shoes, not an animal.

My mother and uncle also have shared nightmares before, despite one living in England and one in Sweden, and seeing each other once every two years on average. 

Me - when I was 16/17 I lived in a very old country village, and was walking back to our cottage from my friend's house, in one of the newer houses lower in the village. I glanced into the windows as I passed, as you tend to when it's dark out and the lights are on in the houses - until I saw something that made me actually feel sick with shock. Staring out of a normal family living room was a completely translucent, stereotype ghost child. She was immobile, with her hand against the window pane just staring out. She didn't appear to see me or anything, but I was terrified. Just as I began to run, I forced myself to look back to check that she was still there, and that she looked the same from a different angle. She was and she did, and I walked home the long way for the two years until I moved out of the village.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1irf5k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1irf5k/me_fam_three_generations_of_unusual_encounters/,

1370916166.0,33,self.Thetruthishere,1g396e,[FAM] [Me] Who's The Lady Crying in the Corner?,samm157,41,8,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1g396e/fam_me_whos_the_lady_crying_in_the_corner/,"Hi, r/Thetruthishere. I submitted one of my more unbelievable stories yesterday. The one I’m about to tell you now is not nearly as crazy as the other one, but it is definitely spooky. 

I overheard this story when I was about ten, I think. It was late one night after my aunt’s birthday party, and the last stragglers were hanging out at my nana’s house. It was just me, my mom, my dad, and my nana inside. My younger sister and my grandpa were outside, shining some kind of police grade flashlight (my grandpa was a deputy back then) all the way across the giant back yard, so they could see the raccoons hiding in the woods. 

Anyway, I wanted to stay inside for some reason. So, I was sitting in my nana’s rocking chair, in the living room, watching TV. My parents and nana were in the dining room, which would have been just behind me, and had no walls separating it from the living room. I start to notice them whispering. Not wanting to miss out on whatever they didn’t want me to hear, I tuned out the TV and started listening in on them. 

I remember it started out with a discussion about the Bell Witch. I have no idea why they were talking about that, other than maybe because I know it’s my dad’s favorite scary story. That story was creepy enough on it’s own, for ten year old me. But what they started talking about next was entirely different level of scary. 

Their story started with my cousin, Rebecca. (Rebecca is about twelve years older than me, I believe, but the story they were telling was about when she was two.) 

One day, Rebecca’s mom decided to take Rebecca to visit my her grandma (my great-grandma). My nana was there, too. (My nana is Rebecca’s aunt.) They were sitting in the kitchen, having coffee and whatnot, when Rebecca said she needed to go to the bathroom. Since she was still potty training and all, being only two, my nana offered to take her. 

Rebecca and my nana got a couple of feet down the hall before Rebecca stopped dead. She didn’t want to walk anymore. My nana asked her why and her response was, “There’s a lady crying in the corner.” 

Well, there was certainly no one there besides Rebecca, my nana, Rebecca’s mom, and my great-grandma. There was definitely no crying lady in the hallway in front of them. My nana tried to convince her that nobody was there, but Rebecca was having none of it. 

I don’t know if they ever got her to go to the bathroom or what, but that part is kind of irrelevant. Everyone there kind of wrote it off as Rebecca’s imagination; children that age say odd things. 

Everybody forgot about it, until one day, when I was two years old. 

We were at my great-grandma’s house again. This time the only people there were my parents, my nana, and my great-grandma. Everyone was sitting in the living room, watching Jeopardy. It was a pretty normal visit, until I spoke up. They say that I looked up, focused on the corner of the room, and said, “Who’s the lady crying in the corner?” 

Needless to say, this kind of freaked everyone out. It was the same thing my cousin said, twelve years before, in the same house, and I was the same age my cousin was when she said the same thing. If it was a coincidence, it was a pretty big one. 

To this day, I’m not quite sure what was going on. It’s been speculated by my family that it was my great-great-grandma, who died before she got to meet Rebecca and me. Rebecca has never mentioned this, and I’ve never asked. And I don’t remember any of it happening, because I was so young. But I know my family wouldn’t have lied about something like that. 

I’d love to go back to the house and see if I could have any other experiences with it. But, sadly, my great-grandma died a few months after I heard this story, and another family owns it now.

In the late 80’s, I moved into a one bedroom flat in a very old cottage.
The cottage was split into two, with another (medicated) couple living next door.
It was also fully furnished with old furniture, which I now believe can add to the “old vibes” of a place.
The cottage was over a hundred years old and it was rumoured to be the first brothel in the city and it sat right next to a very old graveyard.  
 One night, I heard a gothic woman singing opera or something in this graveyard and the voice carried so well and spookily, it sent shivers down my spine.
Another time, while in the bath, I heard a horse and carriage go by, but I digress.
The house always felt like it had a history but it didn’t feel evil or threatening.  The first night I stayed there, I had a very unsettled sleep and dreamed there was a party in the living room with lots of people poking in their heads to see me asleep in the bedroom.
But things only started to get interesting when my girlfriend stayed over.
She woke up…bolt upright in bed and screamed at me that there was a man at the window screaming at us to get out because the house was on fire.  I tried to get her to describe him; she just said he was “olden day” and white.  She refused to stay over again, it was obviously that real for her, but I just took it as a bad dream.
The things started to go missing, just cigarette lighters and coins that you would search everywhere for and then find them in plain sight on the floor, where I had already checked.
This happened with my house keys, so a friend and I got in his car, drove to my girlfriends for the spare key and drove home.   Parking next to the cottage and getting out of the car, my friend saw a key appear in mid-air and drop to the pavement.  I heard the tinkle, he was spooked.
Not long after, I had friends around and was in the lounge, when I saw in a split few seconds, a woman walk past my hallway in a distinctive flower patterned dress.  Running into the lounge, I had two friends around and they were both wearing jeans.
One of my friends invited a person who I would describe as a white witch.   She owned a crystal shop.  This lady came round and performed a ceremony where we sat together on the floor with crystals and candles.   Invoking “angels” she invited who was ever in the house to come forward and step into the light…at that moment I swear I saw a bright glow and flash and then in front of us, all these coins and lighters appeared on the carpet.   This lady explained it was a small boy that was trapped but had now gone to the light.
This never explained the woman in the flower dress.
The lady and I went around and planted crystals and herbs on the corners of the property.  She explained that this would heal the land.
Not long after, I moved out.
While moving a chest of drawers, a photo fell down from behind.  It was a picture of a middle aged lady standing in my garden wearing the same dress.  Now I was spooked.
Funny enough, straight after I moved out, the house was done up and then, strangely, it was bulldozed.
Now sitting on the same spot is a garden sanctuary.  The council even diverted some of a creek to flow in it, there are carvings and everything.  Whatever that white witch did, it worked.

Here’s the google image, go to street view and have a look if you don’t believe me.  http://goo.gl/maps/w4sJH

Perhaps not that scary, but really interesting to go through.   There’s a lot that we still don’t know.

I thought you might enjoy a quick story about a friendly spirit.

My mom grew up in a small home in the Chicago area. Many of the buildings are very old and have a lot of history. 

There isn't much of a story here in this instance, but she said that every once in a while, the whole family would experience some odd things like:

* Feeling random cold spots in the house that made no sense, even during the hot summer

* All windows and doors would be closed, but suddenly they'd smell fresh flowers and an isolated breeze would come down the stairs and go through the house.

* Several times, my mom and aunt saw hanging framed pictures on the wall swinging back and forth on the nail, sort of like a pendulum in a clock does, except faster.

* Once when my mom was getting ready to take an afternoon nap, her hand was hanging over the side of her bed and she felt an unseen person gently grab her hand and hold it in a loving way. She said it was scary obviously, but that she didn't feel threatened in any way. She slowly pulled her hand back and tucked it under the blankets.

She and her family ended up moving out of the city and into the northwest suburbs a while later, for reasons unrelated. My mom found out that the house in the city used to belong to an old woman who had lived there from the day she was born, until the day she died in the house. My mom got the feeling that the activity in the house was just the old lady, and that maybe she saw my mom in an endearing way because she missed her children or grand children.

__TL;DR  My mom grew up in an old house that used to belong to a woman who lived there from birth til death, and died of old age. The family experienced unexplained drafts, flowery smells, swinging pictures on the walls, and the old lady's spirit tried to lovingly hold my mom's hand once when she was trying to nap.__",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_19u4s0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/19u4s0/fam_a_lighthearted_experience_my_mom_had_in_her/,

---

This story isn't a ghost story - I have no idea what it is, although everyone who lived in and visited the house in question used to say they thought it was haunted. This is just plain weird.

I left this house four and a half years ago, but the two incidents occurred around a decade or so ago. It was a largish, five-bedroom house in North London. I shared with four other people, depending on the period, as others moved in or out while I was there. There were two separate incidents of a very similar nature which freaked me out at the time: I saw what appeared to be solid, living versions of a housemate's friend and my then girlfriend, while they were actually elsewhere in the house.

I've made a little floorplan to give you an idea of the layout, as it can be tricky to visualise: http://i46.tinypic.com/v8e7pf.jpg.

The first was Jen. She was, at the time, a lady in her forties. She was a tall, slim, Scottish lady, with short, dyed-auburn hair. She would often come over and in summer, my housemate, Marie, would often have barbecues in the garden. This was one such day. I had been outside, talking to them and eating, and returned to my room - front of the house, on the ground floor; what would once have been the living room - before heading back out to the garden. I walked out of my room as Marie was heading along the upstairs corridor to hers, and moved toward the rear of the house, past Andy's room, and stepped down into the kitchen. At the time, we had high cupboards above a large, perhaps 3ft wide window from the kitchen into a small living room, and a narrower passage through the door to get into the room. Next to this gap was Jen, reaching up to get something out of the communal, sliding-front cupboard. I physically squeezed past her and walked through the living room, out of the back door and... Jen was sitting at the garden table with one of our neighbours, in mid-conversation. There was no physical way she could have passed me to get to the garden from the kitchen, never mind doing so without me seeing her. It wasn't Marie, either - she was upstairs, had short, with dark hair and wearing an entirely different outfit.

Jen and Tony could see from my face that there was something wrong - and we were the only four in the house.

The other occasion was following a late trip to the cinema with my girlfriend at the time, Kate. We had a habit of going to see The Lord of the Rings on weekends, while Fellowship was still in the cinema. On one such night, we walked in and I immediately made for the upstairs bathroom, leaving Kate to walk into my room, immediately to the left of the hall, before the stairs. This was unusual for two reasons: we had a small, downstairs WC between Andy's room and the kitchen, opposite the understairs cupboard, after the step down; and because for some reason I didn't turn any lights on, which is strange as I hate the dark. Always have.

On this occasion, not only did I go upstairs to pee in the dark, I came back down in the dark, too. When I walked into my bedroom, expecting Kate to be there, she was not and the lights were still off. I went looking for her. I walked straight down the hall toward the back of the house, and saw her in the kitchen, in the dark - lit by the moon and streetlights, through a large external window above the sink. She turned away from the sink to the counter on the opposite wall, holding something as if she had picked up a glass of water.

I started talking to her. And then within a pace or two, I reached the step before the WC and kitchen. I realised that she had gone and for a split second thought she was obscured by the edge of the door frame. But Kate was a stable hand and slim from physical work, but not four inches from front to back. There was no way she could have been hidden by the door frame and two inches of wall.

I called her name. Nothing. I called her name again. Nothing. I asked where she was. And then I heard her voice.

She was in the WC - obviously, with the door closed. The door that opened outwards into the hall, before the kitchen, so that she could not have moved from the kitchen into the WC without obstructing my view into the kitchen. And I saw her clearly, as real as I can see my housemate sitting in the chair across the room from me now.

Marie walked in the front door as I was calling Kate's name. She witnessed my genuine shock, as did Kate.

So, how in hell did they get from the places where I saw them to the places where they were? All I can imagine is that it was a glitch in the matrix, of some kind. Perhaps some kind of micro timeslip? I have no rational explanation. These weren't corner-of-the-eye experiences. In one case, I physically touched the person and I struggle to put that down entirely to imagination.

1351197684.0,34,self.Thetruthishere,1233bh,[LEG] &amp; [ME] Der Butzemann ,686847dd,43,9,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1233bh/leg_me_der_butzemann/,"I am honestly scared as fuck and questioning my sanity. This account is a throwaway for that reason (and I live in a very small town, so teens have nothing else but reddit).


But first, I have to explain a local (Pennsylvania Dutch) Legend and some background.


The Pennsylvania Dutch are really German/Swiss. They came from the Rheinlands, Alsace, Swabia, among other places in the late 18th and early 19th century. At this time, it should be noted Germany was not a country, it was a collection of city states and territories, and the Standard German (the main German of today) was only a written language. The people spoke their native Germanic languages: Swabian, Prussian, Bayernish, Alemannish, etc. So when they immigrated to central and southern Pennsylvania, they dialects mixed with English influence to make a new language (or language continuum). In this language, the word for German (and themselves) Deutsch - was Deitsch (prn: d-eye-tch). So basically, their English neighbors thought they were Dutch (or were unsure as Dutch as an older meaning of ""anything Germanic""). But anyway, that's basically how the Pennsylvania Dutch got here and got their name.


It is FALSE to think that only Amish are Pennsylvania Dutch. Plenty of Lutherans and other Protestants from Germany came to America and lived with technology and all that and spoke PA Dutch, however, after the World Wars most non-Amish wanted to Americanize their children and only taught them English, because many where harassed for speaking PA Dutch/German outside of their homes during the conflicts.


It may surprise you to know (or not if you've read Nancy Drew or other 50's mystery novels) that the non-Amish PA Dutch were also very superstitious &amp; most believed in a good healing folk magic called 'Braucherei' (which invokes the names of Saints and Jesus) and a bad dark magic known as Hexerei. If you speak normal German you'll know brauchen is the verb to need. And I don't think anyone knows how in PA Dutch it came to also mean this sort of good magic. They also made hex signs and stars that they put on their barns or houses to ward off bad spirits or the evil eye. (This is where those red stars come from that have become real popular even in Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey)


Well, many people in towns like mine are still pretty ""Dutch"" in the food we eat, our way of decorating, and for my family how we speak. We do use English quite a bit especially outside the house and I would call it my first language, but we do still speak PA Dutch for everyday household things. E.g. Kumm un helf mer die Lewesmiddel neizubringe! (Come and help me bring the groceries inside!) or: 'S Owedesse is faddich! (Dinner is ready!) I guess this is because my family has been and still are farmers. And my grandparents and greatgrandparents were stubborn and didn't want to give the language up. 


Sorry for all that. Now onto the actual legend. Der Butzemann basically means the Boogeyman in English (and in German German) but in some towns PA Dutch it has a more specific meaning: a Braucherei scarecrow created to protect the crops. Basically, you make a scarecrow on groundhog day (Murmeltierdaag) and fill it with at least some of the stalks of last year's crop, then you say ""prayer/spell"" and breathe into a mouth-slit you've given it to 'awaken it'. 


You may have other scarecrows but you only do this to one. I guess he's supposed to be the leader. But anyway, the really important thing is you have to burn him to relieve him of his duties and (he dies with the harvesting of the crop I guess so it's like a funeral) before Halloween (which in our dialect of Deitsch at least we call Allelieweziel which means 'the goal of all love') However, if you didn't burn it by then, it was bad luck. Now I've heard two versions of this part: His spirit cannot move on to the next world so he haunts you / He passes away and a evil spirit possess his body. My great-grandfather told me when I was a child, that when he was a child, a family didn't burn their Butzemann and an evil spirit possessed it and it ran about the countryside terrorizing people at night. 


But there's apparently one more thing that is worse than not burning him at before Halloween and that his stealing his clothes and wearing them (they normally have an outer old flannel or something over a t-shirt to wave in the wind so taking it off doesn't empty out the filling).
Legend has it this will make him haunt you. So naturally, it's a big dare around here to try and get a friend to steal the shirt off of a scarecrow (you can't tell them apart by looking) taking the chance of being caught or it being a Butzemann.


So here's were I come in. I did this, but I know it was a Butzemann, because it was my uncle's who lives down the road. Earlier this month I was drinking and smoking with some friends and it's so fucking boring around here (you must understand that) so a lot of kids do shit to get scared, like going into abandoned barns at night, going into the woods at night to these ""haunted places"", etc. I've done all of that myself growing up and other than running into squatters once and just getting scared, nothing 'paranormal' ever happened. 


So we head up to my uncle's fields and are sneaking through the fields. We come to the Butzemann, I take his shirt put it on for a few minutes. Nothing. Nothing happened. We laughed and I was sort of a 'hipster' old, ratty flannel and what can I say I decided to keep it. We left and went back to my shed (weird but my parents bought me a brand new shed in our back yard for my 19th birthday cos I've shared a room all my life til then. It's done up nice with carpet and a heater and everything). Now eventually my friends head home and I go to bed.


I wake up the next morning and walk out of the shed to go into the house and it and the barn have been teepeed. I'm standing there just looking at it, when I swear to God I heard voice behind me call out ""Des hawwich geduh"" (I did that). But this is were I begin to question my sanity. Because it was my voice that said it... or rather the voice you think with inside your head... but I didn't think it. I heard it... but then I start too second guess myself... did I think it or hear it? There's nothing behind me anyway. So I go into my house and my parents have already seen it and are mostly laughing about it. A little pissed that we have to clean it up but laugh it off as a prank done by some neighbor kids. Which is true, that is probably what it was.


A week goes by and nothing else weird happens. Then next weekend, I'm coming back from a shop and I go into my shed and it smells awful. Like literally like something rotting. So I sniff around to try and find it and it's coming from my hamper. I open it up, but don't see anything but clothes. I start going through it and feel something damp. I pull it out and it's the fucking shirt I stole. It's damp and smells awful. I have no idea what the fuck is on it... but it sort of smells like skunk and dog shit, but it's not stained or anything. So I put it in a garbage bag and through it out in the trashbin outside. But as I walk away I hear the same my-voice/thought as before say ""Awwer ich hab gedacht, du wottscht ihn?"" (But I thought you wanted it?). But there's no one there. So I guess I thought it, but it felt like I heard it... like I didn't think it. 


But then I go into the trash because I think maybe I should bring it back to the Butzemann but when I pull it out... it doesn't smell at all. It was dry and didn't smell. 


I'm sorry this is so long and it's freaking me out thinking about it... there's more to tell but I'm getting worked up and I can tell I'm starting to write shittier and shittier.

my grandparents always had dogs, when they first moved in they had a lovely pair of dogs that were mother and daughter they died within a few weeks of each other so they got a new dog. i never met this dog and i was only about 4 so i don't think i was really told much about it and i definitely wasn't told that my grandad had to shoot it when it attacked the next door neighbor's goat. by the time we went to visit they had got another dog, a dalmatian called merlin. the first thing i said when we walked in was 'i didn't know they had 2 dogs' my dad questioned me about it and i told him that i had seen not just a dalmatian but another dog, i described it to him and apparently it was spot on for dudley the dog that attacked the goat. my parents now own this house and there hasn't been a dog in the house for years but you will still sometimes get a very strong wet dog smell that seems to just wonder about.

i refuse to stay in the front guest bedroom when i stay it just feels wrong, even my dad can't sleep in that room and he is not a firm believer in spirits. when i was younger and we went to stay with my grandparents my brother and i used to share the front guest bedroom and it wasn't too bad. once we got too old to share a room i had to stay in that room by myself, i fully felt creeped out in there and this is when i started to hear the breathing. i normally sleep on my left side and i could hear a soft ragged breathing behind me, at first i didn't think 'oh its a ghost' so i rolled over it stopped and there was nothing there i thought it was just me somehow. everything was fine for a few minutes but then a tapping started coming from the built in cupboard that i was now facing. i got up and turned the light on, checked the cupboard out and there was nothing there, no sign of mice or anything. i tried again to go to sleep and the same thing would always happen, strange breathing on one side tapping on the other. i didn't sleep till dawn and i had the room light, the lamp and tv on and fell asleep on the floor. i never went in that room again.

there used to be an old portrait of a man in the lounge, was a distant relative on my nans side i think. he looked a bit like a grizzled sea captain with a big grey beard and bushy eyebrows. there was always a horrible feeling coming from that picture, if i was sitting in the lounge by myself i could feel the eyes staring at me no one liked it except my nan. i was very happy when it went to my uncle and aunts they keep it in the loft because they hate it too.

there have been many random doors opening and closing too many times to list. we all got used to it and now don't really notice it. though i have only heard talking once. i was going to stay with my parents for a week, this was after they came to own it, but they weren't going to be in when i got there but i have a key so i let myself in. i had my kids with me and under their normal noise i started to hear mumble/whispering at first i just dismissed it as the kids were making so much noise. after they were in bed i was sitting in the lounge reading and i started hearing it again. after a few minutes of listening it sounded like there was a man and a woman talking quietly  in a different room. i had a little look round to check there wasn't a tv left on somewhere or something but i couldn't find anything. the really odd thing was that i didn't feel scared or even creeped out i was just intrigued, when my parents got home i told my mum and she just said 'oh i haven't heard them for a long time' apparently they used to hear it all the time when they first moved in always a man and woman talking in a hushed voice.

i know its not much but there it is, thanks for reading :)

She had cancer, and had chosen to die at home in February, in Canada. Most of the family was there, tending to her needs like rubbing her feet, feeding her whatever she wanted and just...providing support. Grandma was the heartbeat of our family. When everyone who was able to come was there, my grandfather picked up her hand, kissed it very tenderly and said ""ok, Doris, you can go now"". And she did.

What was weird was that within moments of her death, all the plants on her balcony and in their apartment had begun to bloom, and a warm, pleasant breeze blew through the place. Grandma LOVED plants, so quite naturally there were a great deal of them...

I remembered that in some Native Cultures it is believed that the spirits of those that we love are carried in the wind, and that unseasonably warm breeze was so incredibly comforting.

",kanic,39,8,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/xb9vr/last_winter_me/,"first off, i'll start by saying this is the truth and has been one of many encounters over my lifetime as I've been living pretty strange area of land this past year. Ufo sightings and strange occurrences are pretty common.  Bare with me as this is my first post in this subreddit, i'm not really sure of the format. I guess it's also important to mention that the area where this happened is on an indian burial ground.

Ok so last winter me and my cousin and our dog went for a walk over to where the indian burial ground is as it's a pretty beautiful area, winter or not. It had just started snowing so even though it was getting close to night it was still quite light out. so we get over to a hill on the far side of the field where we usually like to hang out when we see a fire has been lit near the base of it. we thought that was a little bit strange that we couldn't see any foot prints leading up to it or around it but chalked it up to having snowed recently. 
 
 After looking for foot prints we decided to walk up to a big glacier rock that was farther up the hillside deeper into the burial grounds to see if who had lit the fire was hanging around there possibly. we didn't find anyone but instantly regretted it as our dog became very alert and started acting weird and we both felt as though we were being watched. we both decided to head back down to the open field area because there we could at least see anything coming at us. as soon as we started walking back down the hill to the field our dog took off running back home, leaving us behind. 
  
  That made both of us a lot more uncomfortable but we stayed near the fire in the field a bit longer and just hung around even though we still had the feeling of being watched. It was around this time it became to uncomfortable and we started leaving. then we both heard a sound that i to this day can remember but cannot duplicate. We both heard a voice that sounded like it was speaking on many different pitches, or with different echos. it sounded like it was speaking words but not any language either of us recognized. Both of us were pretty much dumbfounded and didn't move until it stopped. 
 
 My cousin immediately was going to run but i told him to stop, I at least wanted to get a glimpse of what could make a sound like that. He said fuck that, he'd already had enough close encounters and started running. so my choices were stay there alone or go with him. I chose to run. To this day I still wonder what it was. It definitely didn't sound like any animal i'd ever heard and we know what most of the animal noises. There's been so many stories past down about different types of spirits in the hills I wouldn't be surprised if that's what it was.

Questions are welcome i'll try to answer the best I can.

1336420226.0,32,self.Thetruthishere,tbn9e,Doppelganger at the Mansfield Reformatory [ME],Weft_,36,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tbn9e/doppelganger_at_the_mansfield_reformatory_me/,"A little back story I've always told my girlfriend  that I always wanted to go ghost hunting. I always brought it up jokingly, like around Halloween I would always suggest going to a grave yard or something of that nature. So my birthday was in January and she surprised me with two tickets to take a tour of the Mansfield Reformatory, it was about a hour and a half drive. I had mixed emotions when she told me, because I wasn't really sure if I would like going there, but hey I had a few months to do some reading and learn a little more about the history of the place. 





Jump to that night. We drive to Mansfield and I borrow my  cousins camera so I could take some pictures. It was a really nice setup, they had food and drinks. Around dusk they split us up in to 3 groups of 20 and we head in. At this point I was pretty skeptical but I was hoping to see or experiences something. The tour was pretty awesome, they took us to all the historical places and told everyone about different experiences people have had in certain  rooms most of them were first hand experiences of the tour guides, for example flashlights dying, flashlights moving by themselves, footsteps above you, and one that stood out to me. One of the men tour guides talked about a doppelganger ghost. He said that on multiple occasions people saw someone who worked there had tried to hold conversations with them or try and get the persons attention, but when asking the person later about the conversation the person was either in another part of the building at the time or not even in the building when the conversation went on. After that they also took us to different places where they filmed The Shawshank Redemption it was very interesting . We also went to the shower room and this lady was ""communicating"" with a spirit there with the dowsing rods, It was kind of cheesy but I was in the mood to believe. After the tour it was around 9 and we all met up again then they turned us lose. We had all night to walk around the prison and explore. 





Right off the bat my girlfriend and I turned on our flashlights and started walking down one of the main corridors. My girlfriend was pretty nervous about the whole thing and was kind of regretting getting herself into something like this. After wondering round for 5 minutes we met up with another young couple that was in the same boat, two young college students first time ""ghost hunting"" girlfriends freaked out. So the logic thing to do was to join our forces. So our little group wondered around for a good 3-4 hours, not really seeing or hearing anything. The place is huge so you would only see another group maybe once a half hour. Once we met up with people they were pretty eager  to ask to swap stories of the night. Of course we told them that we ran into the occasional bat flying at head level. We heard a few stories of people hearing foot steps, feeling cold spots and getting touched. We just took those stories for a grain of salt. It was getting pretty late around 2-3 so we went and explored a little more.





Here is where things get interesting. We head to the front of the building, for people who have seen The Shawshank Redemption it is the room with the safe in it, also I think its the main detention officer office. It was one of the only room with a desk and chair in it. so we goofed around taking turns sitting in the chair from the movie. After we sit in there for a while we decide to turn off our flashlights and just sit in the dark for a while and listen. When we got bored with that we exited the room, and started to look at our map to see where we wanted to go next. As we were looking at the map we hear someone coming up the stairs behind us, no big deal so we shine our flashlights over to the stairs because at this point we didn't see any lights coming up the stairs which was odd because that part of the building is pretty dark. Then up pops one of the main tour guides from earlier, no problem we saw a few of the guides walking around earlier just checking up on people and make sure everyone is doing fine. The wired part was he didn't stop, but he walked right by us he looked like he was on a mission, walking with perfect posture and had a blank stare on his face. So he walks right by us right into the room we just left. We were all kind of puzzled, like I said before ever other guide were pretty friendly they  would stop and talk to you. Something didn't seem right. So me and the other guy I was with walked back in the room we just came form. As we entered my heart stopped for a second, no one was in the room. It was completely empty. My mind was racing trying to figure out a way to explain what just happen. I turned to the guy I was with and we look back at me with his jaw dropped. Sure enough we backed out of the room, the girls were asking us why we didn't go talk to the tour guide and why we acting weird. We were pretty dumbfounded and I couldn't  talk, but the guy I was with said something along of the lines of ""there's no one in there"" The two girls gave the ""WTF"" faces at each other and we all stumbled back into the room. Sure enough no one was in there. Not going to lie we found the closest exit and promptly said our good-byes and left.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_tbn9e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tbn9e/doppelganger_at_the_mansfield_reformatory_me/,

Ok, earth has an electro-magnetic field. That's a fact. People do as well, albeit much much much smaller. That's a fact. 

In a larger sense, space (and possibly time) is distorted by the presence of a gravity. Electromagnetic fields are also tied into this. 

[link to scholarly paper, not mine of course](http://www.linusosullivan.com/uploads/Energy.pdf)

So... what if every residual haunting is actually a result of some sort of interaction of local electro-magnetic and gravity fields that creates a sort of window to a specific instance in time?     
That is to say, when you experience a residual haunting, i.e. a haunting/ghost that is tied to a specific place and repeats the same actions over and over, regardless of outside stimulus or events, could it actually be some strange time-warp wherein we're viewing a slim segment of the past. 


There's also the possibility that this type of phenomenon could explain some intelligent hauntings as well IF they are confined to certain locale. The distortion created by gravity/emfs could distort sound and light (scientific possibilities) and when people whose personal emfs are compatible enter the area where these strange events are located, they are able to speak/see across time in a very limited way in that area.      
This would explain various strange and unexplained noises (voices from different people at different times) as well as why the hauntings in these areas 'react' to witnesses.

I have been a skeptic all my life, but I am wondering if perhaps I have been wrong, and maybe I should be a more open-minded individual. I have yet to explain this experience I am about to tell you, but I would like to hear your own theories about what happened and what I saw over ten years ago.

It was about 9:30PM in Phoenix Arizona. Back then gas was hovering around $1 a gallon and my friends and I would drive in my used Mitsubishi Eclipse from Phoenix to Tempe (about a 40 min ride) to party with some college friends. My best friend Chris was with me at the time and we pulled into a gas station on the corner near my house to fill up the tank before heading out for the evening. It was a typical Arizona night… dry air, no clouds, no wind, and the temperature was around 100 degrees. The sun had already set earlier (around 7:30-8:00) and we were happy not having to deal with the additional desert heat.

I pulled the car up to the last gas pump. There was a large overhang above us, with enormous white lights illuminating the area. Like your average gas station, these lights were very bright and illuminated a wide area very well. I stood on the driver’s side, with the gas nozzle inserted and began fueling. My buddy, Chris, got out of the car and stood about 4 feet from me, on the same side while we started to chat about our evenings plans.

In the middle of our conversation there appeared what I can only describe as a white sparkling laser. It lasted about 1-2 seconds, and then disappeared. It was a brilliant white light, brighter than any laser light I have ever seen, and it was about 1 foot long, suspended in the air vertically. It seemed infinitely thin, and it sparkled as if someone where sprinkling extremely fine glitter through a laser beam. This gave it the impression of something like electric dust being poured onto the ground, only it hovered and did not continue to fall, nor was it a continuous line. The sparkles were perfectly straight, as if someone had cut reality with a scalpel. There was no sound accompanying the sight, nor was there any smell. It was incredibly unnatural looking, and it was as bright as an electric arc, but instead of the usual bluish glow that electricity gives off, this was the most perfect white light I can imagine. The line of light was within reaching distance of both of us, and appeared directly between us, at about waist to mid-chest height, approximately 3 feet off the ground. It was less than the thickness of a human hair, like an infinitely fine thread of pure energy. It was like a Hollywood special effect!

Chris and I both said, “WOA!” at the same time and were completely surprised by the event. Knowing that my description of things might taint his own perception, I immediately asked him, “What did you see exactly?” He replied, “Those white sparkles!” I asked him to describe it in detail, and it matched my own perception of what happened. We check the cement pavement for any sign that something had indeed fallen from the canopy above us. We searched for insects, spider webs, liquid of any kind, all the while knowing that what we had seen defied our own explanation that this could be the cause. Nothing was found in the area, either on the ground or on the car. I finished paying for the gas and we drove off. Afterwards we both decided to term the phenomenon “fairy dust” because of its seemingly falling motion, like glitter.

I’ve searched the internet several times for other accounts of this phenomenon. Perhaps it was electrical in nature? But I could find no evidence of anything matching my description, and being at a gas station, seems like it would be a very dangerous place to have mid-air static discharge. Most electrical phenomena have smells and sounds associated with them. I’ve heard of other individuals seeing something like this sparkly event, and some have claimed to see it more than once inside their house, but I have only been able to find 3 other people who have witnessed this, and none have had a witness with them as I did. The closest example I can show is something like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt7-lOur-VM but my own situation was on the ground, about a foot long, and completely vertical, lasting less than 2 seconds.

So there you guys have it. I wish so very badly that this was a supernatural event. I want to believe! I want to say I have seen a tear in reality, but somehow I’m afraid this was some kind of strange electrical discharge that has yet to be documented. Tell me what you guys think. Others have speculated from angels, to spirits, to rare forms of ball lightening, but I have yet to be convinced of anything, either way. It was startling to say the least, and was definitely something out of the ordinary that would catch your eye and perhaps even scare you.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1k0gro,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1k0gro/me_tear_in_the_fabric_of_the_universe/,

But honestly, this is a real experience me and my wavemates had back during training days:
It was the last day of training when this happened, and ever since I've been terrified of elevators:


We had finished all activities for the day and we were just waiting for the final results of the training assessment. Me and my wave mates (a term used to call trainees for a contact center) were exchanging stories when someone mentioned that for some reason one of the lifts keep going to the 6th floor. It doesn't matter which floor you are coming from or which floor you are going to, it keeps going up to the 6th floor. If you are on the 3rd floor and you pressed G for ground floor it still goes all the way up to the 6th floor before it takes you back down to the ground floor.
Now this seems normal, the 6th floor was unoccupied during those times that the lift does this. So its impossible for someone to press the up or down button on the 6th floor. No sense in someone being there either.


Its time to go home and one of our wavemates decided it would be fun to go to the 6th floor to see how scary it is. We all agreed and so we boarded the lift (7 of us) and pressed on the 6th floor and the ground floor (our training room was on the 8th floor). Everyone was holding breath and anticipating a dark scary 6th floor. It was a let down because apparently the 6th floor was now occupied by another contact center, so it was actually bright and there are lots of people.
We were laughing at how stupid the idea was and so my colleague pressed on the close button.
Well we were on our way to the ground floor when we felt the lift stop. We were still chatting and laughing about the sixth floor when the elevator door opened... on a pitch black, shit quiet 2nd floor... I swear everyone just stopped talking all at once. For a second or two we were staring out the elevator, waiting for the person who pressed on the lift button to join us inside the elevator car. Another second passed before we realize... there's nobody there... it was 1 am and the offices on the lower floors operate only until 6 pm...


It was then that one of my wavemates said ""just close the door"". All seven of us; 3 boys and 4 girls probably felt our heart skip a beat when the door would refuse to close..


The small screen on the lift said ""Overweight"".


Thats when the girls started to panic. I was banging on that ""close"" button but the door wont budge.
Two of my more courageous wavemates decided to leg it after seeing that the stairs was just 5 feet away from the lift. The second they leave the lift, it finally closed and the girls were now on the verge of tears. I was pretty scared myself.
I then pressed on G praying to God that my other two wavemates were safe.
The lift stopped and opened on mezzanine floor. Again, no one pressed the mezzanine button, and there was no one outside. It wasnt dark but it was obvious that nobody was there.
I pressed on the close button again and thankfully the next time the door opened it was on the ground floor.


My two gutsy wavemates were safe although they looked pale, they looked horrified. They said that when they ran out the lift they looked back and saw three men wearing black suits in the same lift we were in.
______
I want to know if anyone else had this experience. I wouldnt know if they really saw those 3 men in suit in the elevator, but how do you explain the overweight? Technical  issue? Until now I still get panic attacks when riding an elevator seriously.

I also want to state that I am not schizophrenic (yes I have been to a psychiatrist because I was worried from this to be told not to worry I am not) This all started when I was about four years old. My dad has always worked for a big oil company but at the time he worked in the city we lived in and would only go offshore for a few days here and there. I would always go sleep in their big bed with my mom when he was gone. I remember the first time I saw it was when I woke up really early, which I always did because I loved Saturday morning cartoons. When I opened my eyes I see in the hallway standing a big shadow. It was the same height and build as my father and at first I thought it to be him but it hit me that it wasn't him. The hallway was dimly lit yet it was still pitch black. I could feel it staring at me and just watching me, despite it seeming to not have eyes. I kept blinking to see if he would disappear but everytime he was still there. I tried my best to stay completely still because I had the feeling that if I moved then it would come and do something bad. We had our stare competition for well over an hour and then somehow I fell back asleep and when I woke up it was gone.

Fast forward to me being twenty-two I worked at a place where I would have to be there for 6am. It would be pitchblack when I left for work. I had just gotten ready and opened the front door when I see him standing by the mailbox. I quickly jump back, slam the door and quickly lock it. My heart is pouding as I lift the blinds from the door and look to see he is gone. I quickly run to my car, lock the doors and take off. The drive to work was about 40-45 minutes and of course the roads I had to take had little to no traffic at the time. As I am driving he kept appearing at random parts in the road and just smiling super creepily. One thing I never noticed was what he looked like though. He had longish brown hair and was white. He creeped me the fuck out. I knew I needed to stay away from him. Once I get to work I enter the building and walk to the locker room and change into scrubs quickly not wanting to stay in there alone long. (In case anyone is curious at the time I worked at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette New Iberia Research Center in New Iberia, Lousiana and live in Lafayette, LA). My fellow co-workers and I load up into the work van and drive the couple miles to our secluded work section that everyone called 'The Grove'. My job was Animal Care Technician. I took care of Rhesus Macaque monkeys. In 'The Grove' we had banks A-F and on each bank there were 18 huge ass cages and 36 little mini cages. In each big cage there would be a range from 10-20 monkeys. The small cage would be just another part they could go to unless they just hated everything and one then they were alone. (let me just say these monkeys were super spoiled. We chopped up fruit for snacks for them, they had tons of toys and when they broke the toy it got replaced with a new one.) I had E and F banks. Mine were all they way at the back of our huge fenced in area. While I was in the process of hosing down the huge cages on F bank, I see the man walking towards me again from the corner of my eye and when I look he quickly disappears. I relax after I see he is staying gone. After about an hour (cleaning the cages took a long time) I hear someone whisper my name. I look around to see no one so I continue my work. A little later I hear my older sisters voice say 'throwsomeshade'. My older sister was all the way at her house in Lafayette, I didn't have my phone on me so I didn't somehow pocket dial her and now I'm really feeling crazy. I go to our shack to drink some water and calm myself down. After the work day is done at 4pm I go home. Once laying in my bed getting ready to go to sleep, a deep man's voice says, 'Hello.' My dad is offshore and would have been the only man in the house having that I have to sister's and no brothers so I nope myself out of the room for a little while.

That night I have my first nightmare where the man shows his true form. It is human-like but he is pure gold, with wings and a tail with a super sharp point on it. He was naked and the tip of his penis had the same point as his tail. He tells me I am his and he is ready for me. I know automatically he wants to have sex. I yell, 'NO!' and run away. He then threatens to kill my family and shows me how deadly his tail was. I was hiding under a bed which he proceeds to stab and it almost got me quite a few times. He finally gets me out and rapes me. I bled crazily bad. I woke up the next day and felt as if it had happened in real life. I was super depressed, didn't feel like myself and was terrified. (no I have neither been raped or molested before.) 

A few nights later he takes back his human form and forces me to marry him. He even has tricked me into believing I love him. I watch him kill people for fun and do other crazy fucked up shit.

A night or two after our wedding dream, I am sleeping but I wake up as I feel myself being tugged out of bed and land onto the floor, then I'm back in bed and get pulled back onto the floor. This happens a few times. I am freaking out. Then all of the sudden when I am back in my bed a super bright light appears right over me. This is the brightest light I have ever seen and it is coming from a being. He is laying in the air on top of me looking at me. Like the shadow being he has no facial features but he was still beautiful. I felt no fear of him. He dimmed his light for me to be able to actually look at him without it hurting (I don't know how I automatically knew he was a he) and even though he didn't speak he told me he was there to heal me from the rape and protect me from him (the evil man). The way he healed me was a lot like sex but at the same time it wasn't really like sex. He eventually leaves and I fall back asleep. The next day I was no longer depressed, felt like myself again and was no longer terrified. I felt very safe.

A few nights later I have a dream and in the dream I am hiding at a different place from my house. This building I knew the evil man could not enter. Well the man letting me hide there walks outside which I know is strange so I follow him and hide in some bushes. I gasp as I see him walk up to him. He is starting to tell him he has me inside when all of the sudden a shadow person is like ripped out of the man's body. The shadow disappears and the body collapses to the ground. He is angry and he knows I am around. He yells out,' I can't see you myself but I will find you. Believe that.'

The weekend comes and as I am getting out of my car after pulling up at home from the corner of my eye I see the shadow being standing in the middle of the street in broad daylight. When I actually look at him he takes off running super fast towards me and disappears right before being in touching distance. I am really freaked out since I hadn't seen one in 18 years and I somehow knew it was the same one.

That's when it hit me that the shadow being and the evil man are related. I guess the shadow being is like a watch dog for him. It's been a while since I have seen him or a shadow being so I guess the blinding light being is still protecting me. Yes I know how crazy I sound.

I drew pictures of the shadow being and the light being (I'll post them later on or tomorrow)

Edit: I wanted to add the link to the pictures http://imgur.com/a/uogLz

I had done them kind of in a caveman style because for some reason that is how they popped into my head

I have two shorter ones so I'll just put them both in.
The first one takes place a few months after the events in my first post http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/180ufm/me_a_scar_that_doesnt_have_a_logical_story/ 

I was driving the car my parents were letting me use for school over to a friends house. Down in the canyon we were living in a lot of the roads were either gravel, dirt, or just sand. The only paved part was up front by the gate to the road into town.  I was driving around a right hand corner that was behind my house and at the bottom of a very steep hill. It was about 10 something at night and during the week so there weren't any other cars around. There was a heavy treeline on the right side and the hill on the other with some of those concrete barriers keeping the bottom part of the hill from washing out. The part of the road that I was on was just sand. I was going about 15mph because a lot of the people who lived there wouldn't lock their dogs up or follow any kind of leash law and I had no desire to plow over anyone's pet. There was a full moon that night with no cloud cover so it was pretty well illuminated. Out of the corner of my eye I saw something big and dark dash out of the treeline and smash into the rear passenger side of my car, it was a 93 Taurus, which almost made me turn a full 360 and I barely managed to miss smashing into the barriers. There wasn't any damage what-so-ever to the vehicle where the thing hit me, no tracks coming out of the woodline, and no animal anywhere that I could see immediately after. On top of that, nothing that big made our branch of the canyon home. Needless to say it made my butthole pucker a little but there wasn't any damage so I never brought it up and decided to just forget about it.


Another time was when I was 17, this time the location was at my dad's house. It was a newer house inside the city, no more than 10 years old, and in a quiet neighborhood. From my dad's remarriage I had three step-sisters at the time, all younger, with the youngest one being around 6. My dad, step-mom, and I were in the living room watching a movie after my sisters went to bed. The hallway where all the kids rooms had two rooms on one end and one on the other with the door to the living room in the middle. The entertainment center in the living room was between the door to the hallway and the fireplace. The three of us heard something and looked over towards the hallway just in time to see a little girl sized form run past. My step-mom yelled for the youngest one to go to bed because she was the only one that size. Then my dad pointed out that my youngest sister was staying at a friends house for a birthday so he got up to investigate. Before he made it halfway from the couch, which was right in front of the entertainment center and in the middle of the room, both of the candles on the mantle lit themselves. After that happened we all looked at each other for a moment, then my dad sat back down and we never spoke of it again.

Anyway, thought I'd retell this event and post it here since it is a complete mystery.

I was young, probably between 6-8. I was afraid of sleeping in my room as a kid, so i opted to sleep on the couch in the living room even though it seemed twice as creepy, but i was comforted by the fact that i was a lot closer to my parents room which was connected to the livingroom. I just had to look to the left and see into their bedroom, it wasn't an odd occurrence for me to wake up and go to their room to sleep with them during the night.

I don't remember what day it was, i don't remember a lot of things, but i woke up to a lot of yelling, in my sleepy haze it took me just a moment to realize that something felt very off. At the time i slept with this pretty thick blanket, pink and white, had little cartoon kitties on it, also i slept with a ton of stuffed animals around me. a big yellow dog (my fav), two big bears, a scooby doo stuffed animal, all these were big, along with at least 5 smaller stuffed animals. I'd be very snug with the blanket pulled right up over my nose. 

So i woke up feeling this emptiness all around me, and i felt chilly. The first thing i noticed was that the only thing i had on was my socks and the sheet that my mom had on the couch for me to lay on. My blanket, all my clothes aside from my socks were gone and all my stuffed animals were gone. All this i noticed as i heard the large argument coming from my brother's room, which they shared. 

Apparently my mom had woken up and walked into the livingroom that morning and saw me nude on the couch and instead of waking me up she ran into my brother's room demanding that they tell her what they did to me, they were very confused and had no idea what she was talking about and I'm pretty sure neither of them did it, I'm sure i would have woken up if it was them. 

We later found my blanket and stuffed animals in the closet in my room, but we never found those clothes i was wearing. Sleep walking some say but I'm not so sure, I've never slept walk, i don't move at all when i sleep and if i do move it's when i wake up and change positions myself then go right back to sleep. So It's just always going to be a mystery I guess. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1462n9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1462n9/waking_up_naked/,

However, this one night, something special, and terrifying occured. 

Side note: My great grandmother died around the day i was born, so obviously, i never knew her even remotely. No one ever spoke about her around me, as if she never existed. She died in my bathroom, from an unknown cause (to me), and i didn't know this until after my experience. Onto the story.
So this night, i went down to my parents at around 1 in the morning and started freaking out in a night terror. But soon after, instead of waking up, i started screaming things like how my great grandmother died, which turned out to be 100% accurate. That was all my parents told me after, that i was right. I started cursing visciously and flailing my arms around like a mosh pit and continued screaming, and my dad tried to grapple me when i hit him in the face really hard, apparently, with a flail. I eventually woke up, with no idea of the last 20 minutes of screaming at the top of my lungs, flailing my arms aggressively, or describing my (not known at the time) great grandmother and how she died, in extremely accurate detail. 
Just creeps me out looking back.

1347327439.0,35,self.Thetruthishere,zoo99,[ME] Something attacked me in our old house,poetickitty,42,7,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/zoo99/me_something_attacked_me_in_our_old_house/,"My parents moved my sister and I into our first house in the mid- '80's when I was four months old. It was intended to be a ""stepping stone"" house, but we ended up living there for 24 years. The house was built in the '30's and I lived in the same bedroom almost the entire time. The bedroom was at the front of the house, and connecting my bedroom to another smaller bedroom was an attic/crawlspace, which could be entered by a tiny door, about 3 1/2 ft tall and 2 1/2 ft wide. Each door shut firmly, and was difficult to open unless you used the handle. There was no handle and no way to open the door from the inside, and I generally stayed away from it.

I always felt uncomfortable in that room, and I always chalked it up to being afraid of the dark. My first tip-off that something wasn't right was our cats. Our first cat never went upstairs, I always thought it was because she was old. When she died, we got two new kittens. One would not go upstairs at all, and the other would go upstairs, but not enter my bedroom. No amount of coaxing or treats could get that cat in the bedroom.

In my last 2 years of high school, my parents refinished a basement room, and I moved down there once my older sister went away to college. I had frequent insomnia and began a long stretch of night terrors. Once I graduated, I went away to college for four years. However, I was only an hour away from home, and came back to visit my family often (we are all very close). My younger brother had moved into the basement room by then, so my parents put me back up in my old bedroom. The visits home became downright frightening.

The night terrors came back full force, every single night I stayed in that house. I would wake up in a cold sweat and/or screaming, with a terrible feeling that something was there. Something full of hate. Once, I woke up and felt a pain on the back of my left hand. I turned on the light and saw three red marks, like light scratches, and I figured I had done it to myself in my sleep. Each night, I was afraid to go to bed, take off my glasses, turn off the light, or fall asleep. I would lie wide awake for hours trying to get myself to calm down.

On one such occasion, I got the horrible feeling, only I hadn't been asleep yet that night. I was cold, and too afraid to move. Then I felt something on my face- fingernails. Three distinct fingernails, scratching my right cheek. I waited a few minutes, terrified, then ran to the downstairs bathroom. Three red scratches. They didn't break the skin, but they were raised, like a cat scratch. I spent the rest of the night in the living room, watching cartoons with all the lights on.

A few months later, I was getting ready for a trip to New York City to visit my uncle. The night before I left, I got that horrible feeling again. Something was there. This time, it shook my bed. As if someone grabbed a hold of one end, one hand on either side, and shook it back and forth as quickly as possible. I screamed, leapt out of bed, and ran straight to the basement, as far away as possible. I spent the night on the couch a few feet from my brother- all the lights on and the TV on all night.

After the scratching incident, I had contacted my friend, Mindy, who is a practicing Wiccan and semi-clairvoyant. After describing my experiences, she admitted to me that she never felt comfortable in my bedroom, and thought there was something in the crawlspace. Something never felt right to her in that area. When I told her of this new development, she started talking to me about protection.

I was raised Catholic, and still practice (although I don't agree with all of their ideas). Mindy told me to do things in threes: trace a cross over my bed three times, say the Lord's Prayer three times, tell it to leave me alone three times. My mother (devout Catholic) suggested holy water and prayer, but Mindy was afraid of making it more angry, since we had no idea what it was or where it came from. After I had been tracing the cross, etc, I was still having night terrors and getting the feeling of dread, although no further attacks were made. So Mindy and I decided to try my mother's idea. One day, Mindy, my mother and I opened the door to the crawlspace and all held hands. We each took a turn sprinkling the holy water in the crawlspace and said something like, ""You do not belong here. Leave her alone."" We then said the Lord's Prayer out loud three times.

I didn't have any further negative experiences after that. Once that was over, I still got uneasy feelings, and Mindy told me once that there was now a little girl playing in my room that tries to sneak up on her now and then. I moved out about 2 years later, and the rest of my family moved out about 6 months after I did. I've been happily living with my fiancee for 3 years now, and nothing strange has happened to me since.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_zoo99,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/zoo99/me_something_attacked_me_in_our_old_house/,

I'm at a party with my friend, and there are loads of people we don't know. Conversation eases once the drinks start pouring and the bowls go around, and eventually, we begin to talk about weird shit. Usual bullshit ghost stories ensue, and die off when most of the party leave to get more booze and Taco Bell.

One guy stays. My friend knows him, I do not. He's short, blonde, blue-eyed, and seems relatively chill. We do not object when he sits between us on the couch with a fresh bowl in hand.

""I got a story.""

Back in May (this was late June) he and a BUNCH of his friends planned a beginning of summer shindig. 20 of them, or so. They knew a spot somewhere around West Bridgewater (MA) where they could park and then hike deep into the woods for a bonfire. 

The guys were doing the lugwork before nightfall. They had camping gear and alcohol and all sorts of other shit to smuggle in so no one would be stumbling with it in the dark. So they go about their business, are hiking to the spot with the stuff when they find a dead dog. Correction--*half* a dead dog. Oops. Half a dead dog with what looked like a sharpened stick jutting out of its hindquarters. 

They didn't investigate too closely and pushed on, attributing it to the work of a hungry homeless, or something. Push on. The walk goes smoothly and the fellow starts lagging behind with one of his buddies. They were sharing the weight of a big cooler and it kept cutting into their hands. He begins to notice that there are...sounds in the woods on either side of them. Rustling. Twigs breaking. 

We're in the woods. Just animals.

Push on. They're once again in earshot of the rest of the guys, are starting to feel better when he happens to glance in the direction of the forest. And see.

""It...it kind of looked like a dog. It was standing up, though. All hairy and shit. This black hair. Just *looking* at us. It wasn't no dog though, dude, I dunno what the fuck it was. It was LOOKING RIGHT AT US.""

Something clicks in his brain. The rustling he'd been hearing. The dead dog. The guy he's lugging the cooler with, he's looking at it too. None of them move.

""We just dropped the cooler and *booked it*, man. Two thirty racks and a handle of Captain's. We *ran*.""

They run full tilt in the direction they came in. They run screaming at first, to try and warn the others, but soon there's no more air for screaming. They just run. And run. And run.

""It's chasing us. You know. Through the trees. I saw it a few times. It kinda ran like this.""

He drops his shoulders, hunches his back to demonstrate. 

""And making these ""ugh! Ugh!"" Grunting noises. Chasing us, dude.""

They run and run until they're out of the woods. Minutes later, their friends join them. They don't say anything, just get in the cars and go, where they explained what happened once they were away.

It sounds like a ploy to impress two pretty girls at a party. But the fear in his eyes while he told us was real. The way he played with his hands. If it didn't happen, HE believes it happened. You know?

**tl;dr: dude at a party tells me and my friend that an unidentifiable hairy thing with two legs chased him out of the woods**

1321857309.0,34,self.Thetruthishere,mjwc6,[ME][FAM] It Looks Like Our House is Haunted...,annuvin,34,0,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/mjwc6/mefam_it_looks_like_our_house_is_haunted/,"My GF, her son and I moved into a house in December 2010. Since then, we have experienced a number of strange things occuring in the house. Initially, nothing occured for about a month or so. However, my GF's cat didn't adjust well to the move, and would caterwaul relentlessly at our bedroom door all night. To remedy this, we began to put the cat in the basement for the night so he would not wake us up. Sometime in January, I was locking the front door while leaving for work in the AM, when I saw the cat walk out of the kitchen through the window in the front door. I couldn't remember opening the basement door to let him out, and kind of passed it off. 

The next day, I was making coffee while my GF got ready for work when the basement doorknob turned and the basement door opened on it's own, letting the cat out. This was bizarre as I both heard the knob turn and saw the door open and there was nobody in the basement. The house was eco-audited prior to us purchasing it, so there are no drafts to blow the door open. I really have no logical explanation how the door opened on its own and kind of laughed it off. 

Around March, we adopted a dog and things started ramping up somewhat. The dog would sometimes bark down the hallway when nobody else was home, and wagged its tail like it saw somebody it knew. I was home alone with the dog one night watching TV when the dog went into the kitchen. After a few minutes, I distinctly heard a young man talking quietly to the dog, and wondered when my GFs son came home. I walked into the kitchen and found the dog alone. Disturbed, I brought the dog into the living room with me, and about 15 minutes later my GFs son arrived home from work. A couple weeks later, my GF heard what she thought was a young man talking to the dog in the hallway when niether myself nor her son was home. 

One night I woke up and thought I heard furniture being moved around the basement. Thinking my GFs son had friends over, I listened but heard no talking or laughing. I got up went to the basement door and called down. Nobody answered. The dog who was crated in the kitchen wanted out, so I took him out on a leash and brought him back in. I put him back in his crate and went to the bedroom, where I found my GF awake and looking for me. She said she awoke with a ""bad vibe"" and thought there was someone in the house. I took a machete I keep in the closet, went back to the kitchen and took the dog down to the basement with me, but found nothing amiss. I searched the entire house and could find no evidence of an intruder, so we went back to the bedroom. Suddenly there was a very large ""THUMP!"" above our heads in the attic. The ""attic"" is more or less a crawlspace filled with insulation with one trapdoor to get into it. There is no way anyone could have climbed up there as the trap is in the ceiling right outside the bedroom door. I tried to convince my GF it was a mouse and we tried to go back to sleep. 

Around this time, we started hearing phantom footsteps at both day and night. One afternoon, I was taking the dog to the office to do some work on the computer when I distinctly heard someone coming down the hall after me. Both my GF and her son have also experienced the sounds of footsteps, often thinking the other is home when they are not. 

One Saturday morning, my GF and I were sitting on the couch drinking coffee, when we heard the basement door open and the cat came out of the kitchen. Her son was asleep and neither of us had an explanation for the door opening. 

We started refinishing the basement this spring and noticed a lot more activity since we have begun. One night my GF and I were watching a movie when we heard distict knocking on the wall inside the house. My GF thought it was the dog scratching itself until I pointed out the dog was on the other side of the room. We both attempted to replicate the knocking by rapping outside the window, but neither of us could hear it inside. We also hear strange banging in the basement that defies any explanation. Nothing looks out of place when we investigate it. 

My GF's son has a metal clothes rack hanging on the back of his door. Often when he isn't home, we will hear the clothes rack banging on the door. If we open his door to investigate, there is never anything out of place in his room. However, the noise will often start up again after we leave. 

Last week we had three weird instances that stood out. The first was when I was working last Saturday and my GF was alone at home. She sent me an email that said she came down the hall to find both the bathroom and her son's bedroom doors open when she was sure she closed them. She came back an hour later and they were open again. 

Later in the week, my GF awoke one night to use the washroom. When she returned to the bedroom, I awoke and found I needed to use the washroom as well. When I went into the bathroom, I found the toilet seat was up and jokingly asked her if she left it up for me. She said she definitely left it down and had been in there only a minute or so before me. 

On Friday, I was home alone and walked past the basement door, when the knob again turned on its own and the door opened. I was directly in front of it when this happened and cannot explain how it was possible. Perhaps it was a hint to finish the work we started down there...? 

Anyways, that is what we have experienced for the past 11 months. None of us have felt particularly creeped out by any of it (with the exception of the ""intruder"" night) and feel the phenomena is very benign. We aren't scared in any way, and kind of find it interesting that we may be sharing our house with a ghost.

While in law school, I lived in an apartment that was a three story rowhome with basement. It had three bedrooms and two baths (just for reference).

When I first moved in, there were three people residing there. Two moved out and one stayed behind for an additional month, so he and I overlapped if you will.

He was in the process of moving, so he was hardly ever at the apartment. He had a cat, which was at the apartment for the first week. After two weeks, he moved the cat to his new place. He told me that he was moving it to a place where he lived by himself since he was tired of roommates complaining about his cat, and ""blaming things on it."" I didn't really ask for more elaboration.

He takes the cat, and now its just me at the apartment. One night, I think I hear something meowing and scratching, so I go to investigate (I'm on the third floor bedroom). As I open the door I see a cat sprint down the stairs. I figure its just his cat, and go back to Half-Life. Later that night I go to get a drink of water from the kitchen on the main floor, and the cat is down there. It runs into the basement when I come down the stairs and starts meowing loudly. I have some water and decide to go investigate. I go downstairs, and notice that the litter pan, food dish, and water have all been removed. The other roommate took them when he came to move his cat out.

The basement isn't big, and it actually is pretty clean on the floor, but there are a lot of boxes. Basically this was a student apartment so there was a collection of Ikea lamps, old notebooks and binders, the usual student stuff. There is a water heater in furnace in back, and I hear the cat walk back there. Its basically the only part of the basement that isn't really easily accessible. I tried to find the cat (lights are on) but for the life of me I can't.

I left it alone and kept hearing it at night, so the next day I bought cat food, litter, and left a bowl of water for it. I would still hear it scratching and see it heading down the stairs, but never did actually did catch it. It never used the litter or ate the food, but the water would disappear. Not sure if evaporation (the basement was pretty dry) or it was being drunk.

After two weeks, some of the old roommates came back to look for a Simpsons poster they left behind. The girl and I are casually talking in the kitchen, her boyfriend is in the basement looking for it. When he comes back up (hes got the poster, its framed) he says ""I see the cat is still living here.""

I said, I know, the other guy took the white cat, but he left this other one, and didn't tell me or leave food or water. The girl shakes her head and says ""He always lies about his cat. It causes so much trouble and he always denies it.""

They share some other stories about the irresponsible roommate and leave.

At this point, my other two roommates have moved in. There are two women, one is friendly and I get along with her, the other is really quiet and in medical school, so only really comes home to sleep for five hours before heading back in to the hospital. Medical school girl inexplicably has a dog that she keeps in her bedroom. One day dog is in basement, incessantly barking. Medical school girl is trying to get it up the stairs and can't. I eventually come down, and while she drags on the leash I pull under its collar and we drag it up the stairs. She takes it outside for a walk. No idea what dog is barking at. Dog is never allowed in basement again (wasn't really in the first place.)

Second girl roommate is in law school. Very sweet and friendly, but also like 20 and just out of undergrad, alone in a strange city. Her and I become friends. She asks about cat, I tell her its the old roommates, it lives in the basement, etc. She is animal lover, wants to catch it (I love cats too, btw, but just figured live and let live, plus I'm not sure cat exists). Tries EVERYTHING. Cat trap. Treats. Long stakeouts. Nothing.

Anyways, about three months go by, and old roommate with cat comes around. He is looking for winter jacket. Comes in, I mention ""Yeah, I can't believe you left your cat here with no food."" He blows up: ""I don't have another cat! There is no cat! Its not my cat! I don't know that cat! Why does everybody think its my cat! There is no cat!"" slams door and leaves.

Law school roommate and I still hear cat, but don't see it anymore. Mention it to landlord (this really nice older guy). He says ""Yeah, we never knew what was up with roommate and his cats.""

Fast forward six months, leak in roof. Its termites. Landlord calls exterminator. Exterminator does full house sweep and extermination. We all have to leave for a weekend. Exterminator says Dog cannot be here, medical school girls says he is moving with his auntie and uncle in bel air.

Just kidding, dog actually moves back home with her parents. Extermination happens. Next day. Cat noises. Exterminator, can cat get in? ""No, I sealed it up good, shouldn't have any critters in here."" Still hear cat, sometimes see cat on stairs.

My only theories are that it was getting in and out on its own, but we had an exterminator in, as well as an engineer (roof leak) and both said that there was no way they could see for any cat or squirrel to get in. Was a metro area known for rats, but this moved like a cat. Also, every time I share this story online I get ""Basement cat is watching you fap"" jokes.

Dunno, it never bothered me. There are a few other good ""haunting"" type things in this apartment, but this cat story is most substantiated, in my opinion. Just wanted to share.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1jcqb0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1jcqb0/me_haunted_apartment/,

I really need to talk about both Monday night and last night but I feel like there's a good deal more to it I should add, to give whoever's reading the full picture. At the same time, I don't want to ramble or make a big deal out of nothing, or just sound completely unhinged. I don't really know what I'm doing here, I just need to talk. I'm sorry in advance for what I'm sure is going to be a very lengthy post. 

Some things that are probably important for context's sake are that I live with my boyfriend, I've been an insomniac since I was about 4 or 5, and while they're sporadic and I have no control over them, I've gotten hunches or vibes for as long as I can remember. I've learned to trust them, although sometimes I'm in a situation where I have to ignore them. 

Monday: Even though I'd gotten a full night's sleep on Sunday, I'd been seeing these (dime sized) black circles through the day. I've seen things like this quite a bit, but I typically chalk it up to my lack of sleep. Usually it's out of the corner of my eye or when I'm turning my head, and they're always in motion. At one point in the afternoon, I thought I saw my cat walk across the livingroom but when I looked, it was actually a semi shapeless black mass, about cat sized. This time when I saw it, it didn't zoom out of sight like the smaller black dots tend to do, it leisurely floated across the room until it got to the wall and then seemed to sink down into the floor. It was freaky but kind of interesting so I went about my business. 
Because I had gotten decent sleep the night prior, I was surprised to find myself tired by the end of the night. My boyfriend and I went to bed together (something that's become increasingly more rare) and I got a bad feeling when we went into the bedroom. I suddenly felt very uncomfortable, very anxious, and I had a sort of nagging feeling, like we shouldn't be ready to sleep. I took my time getting undressed and then sat down on the bed for a minute, hoping something would click (like I'd left the oven on or something) but after my bf asked if I was going to stay up, I remembered how tired I was and laid down. I had an incredibly hard time drifting off so I just thought about stuff for a few hours with my eyes closed until I abruptly snapped my eyes open and turned my head towards my boyfriend. I don't know why I did it just then, it was without any conscious thought. The room was still dark but the moon (I think) was bright enough to where my eyes could quickly adjust and see pretty clearly. 

As soon as I turned my head, I saw this... face over my bf's hip/side (he was sleeping on his side with his back facing me). It was white with a slit for a mouth, no raised nose or nostrils, and blackness where it's eyes should be. I couldn't make out for sure whether it had actual eyes or not, but there was occasionally a slight shine in the middle of the blackness, so I think it did. Looking at it straight on, the face was shaped a little like the top view of a cow's head. It was looking straight at me. I stared back at it trying to get my brain to register what it really was while my eyes got used to the room. At first I thought it was our dog, who has a mostly white face and had come to bed with us. The minute I saw it, I'd immediately gotten the feeling that I had caught it, that I wasn't supposed to have woken up right then. As I was thinking how strange it was that the dog would be awkwardly standing over my bf, it dawned on me that I was hearing him snore at the bottom of our bed. Without looking away from whatever it was I was seeing, I slowly moved my leg until I made contact with our dog's body by our feet. I can not begin to explain how it felt to realize I was looking at something on our bed that I simply could not account for. By this time my eyes had fully adjusted, and I began to notice the silent movement under/around the face. When I say silent, I mean there was no noise being made at all, at any time during this (other than the light doggy snores) in the room. What I can only assume to be it's body was more like a mass of in motion black shadow, it seemed like it should've been see-through, but wasn't. It wasn't much like smoke so much as the shadow of a swarm of flies, but the blackest shadow I've ever seen - just like the little circles I see on occasion. The biggest parts were on top of my bf, and it appeared to have come from his side of the bed since there was a good part of the blackness on the side of my bf I couldn't see, but there were also smaller, thinner parts that were somewhat wrapped around my bf, in between us. To paint a better picture, it looked a bit like a giant misshapen spider body, with infinite, undefined legs. Two of these legs things were being held in the air, also like the front two legs of a spider, and while bent, were facing towards me. 

What went through my mind was weird and chaotic. I couldn't believe that I was seeing this, but I knew I was. I felt like this thing had been about to do something to my bf, but I didn't feel that I wouldn't have been next. I was terrified and bewildered, but stayed surprisingly calm and still. I wanted to protect my bf, but I didn't think I could. Still staring at the face (which was still staring at me, bobbing back and forth slightly) I slowly (very slowly) started to slide my arm (which was under the sheets) towards my bf. I felt his body, felt his breathing, and I tried to tap him awake without causing the creature to notice. After maybe five or so seconds, the face suddenly rose up (still locked on to me), and though I can not explain why, I KNEW that I absolutely did not want him to wake up. I sensed an incomprehensible danger in the room, especially for my bf. I stopped tapping and stayed still, staring back and trying to keep my breathing steady and unthreatening (I hope that makes sense). There was this moment that felt like mutual uncertainty between us, although I got the impression that it was deciding what to do, whereas I just didn't know what I could. 

Then, it started to pull itself off of my bf, moving backwards towards the wall. The wall is about two &amp; 1/2 ft from my bf's side of the bed, but somehow this thing kept moving back, not into the wall exactly, just... into something that I couldn't see. I watched the shadowy parts slide off my bf, and then watched as they and the face began to get smaller. Not shrinking though, more so it looked like it was getting farther away, right in front of me. Then the wall behind it was back in sight. I had just enough time to think ""Is it over?"" and then a white light outside lit up through the windows (on the other side of the room), stayed just a moment (about two, three seconds), and went away. My eyes had to adjust again, which they did quickly, but it scared the hell out of me to think it might be coming back. Luckily it did not, and after keeping watch over the part of the wall where that thing had disappeared for some time, I woke up my bf and had him turn on the light. I let him go back to sleep and waited until the next day to tell him about what I saw. It felt safer that way. 

He's not a believer in the things he can't explain and is the type to dismiss what he doesn't understand. He is however a very good listener and doesn't scoff or judge those who do believe that there's more to this world than we yet know. In the course of our relationship, he's let me tell him several things and just as he did when I told him what I'd seen that night, he heard me out and then moved the conversation on.  

------------------------------------------------

Last night: I'd slept well the night before, much to both of our surprise, and it was without incident. I'd had a few bad dreams but they were gone as soon as I woke up, although I felt tired and drained all day yesterday. That's not unusual for me though. It also made sense why I was ready to go to bed with my bf last night, although it hardly ever happens three times in a row anymore. Up until we were going to bed, I'd felt fine with the thought of doing so but once we actually began the shut things off, that feeling of dread and hesitation returned. This time it was worse than the other night, although I chalked that up to what had already happened. Still, I tried to stall us in every way possible. I even tried to get my bf to stay up and play video games with me but for him when it's sleepy time, it's sleepy time. Normally if I'm not ready for bed, I'll stay in the other room and do computer stuff but I couldn't shake the idea that I shouldn't leave him alone in that room, so when I couldn't keep him from going in, I joined him. He was already in bed while I was getting undressed and I thought I saw something black (and a little bigger than dime sized) run across my night stand and under a glass decorative bowl I'd just gotten from my grandmother. I turned to my bf to tell him I might need his help with a spider, when the window fan above the stand fell out and crashed onto the bowl, breaking it, and my pillow, where my head would've been. While he cleaned up the glass I searched around for a spider, although I no longer believed I'd find one. I did not. Since there was nothing else that could fall on our heads, I finally put in a movie, settled into bed, and made it about halfway through before falling asleep. 

I woke up several times throughout the night, afraid for what I might see, and scanned the room repeatedly to make sure we were alone. It appeared we were and although I still had that wary feeling, my sleepy state had made it lessen a great deal. Eventually, it was light enough outside, so I relaxed and tried to tell myself I was just ridiculous. This time when I fell back asleep, I had some of the most uncomfortable, disjointing bad dreams I've ever experienced. Or rather, it was all one dream just with different parts. All I remember of it now are shredded rectangles of paper, colors of red dominating and flashing, a ferris wheel spinning freakishly fast, a friend of mine screaming in both pain and anger, and the noise... it was like machines, and metal, and heavy things being pushed/dragged/moving, all screaming endlessly in different forms. I've never had anything like it before and I never want to again.  

Just when it seemed that the chaos was at it's peak, I woke up. The very next second, my bf started screaming and shrieking at the top of his lungs. For a moment I was confused, because I knew I'd woken up but for some reason my head felt like it was covered with bugs (I could even feel them crawling down my neck and the side of my face) and his screams, they were of both panic and great fear. When I turned to him, I saw his eyes and mouth were wide open and he was looking at something I couldn't see while his body jerked and his legs kicked violently. I shot up and called his name but I could barely hear myself over his screams. He started trying to slap and claw at something on top of him and howling (I mean that as dramatically as it can possibly mean) ""Noooooooo"". I started screaming his name and tried to touch him but he was jerking around so much my hands kept getting thrown off. He looked at me, with more fear than I've ever seen in a person, and begged me to help him then he went back to screaming wildly and clawing again. It looked like he was trying desperately to get up, but something was preventing it. I didn't know what to do. Finally I brushed my arm through the air where the nothing was (and eerily enough, where that thing had been). I did it hard and I half expected to feel something but instead, his thrashing almost stopped and he jumped up, shooting to the end of the bed, still screaming like something was trying to get him. When he got to the floor, he stood up and started yelling ""Get off me, oh my god, get off me"" in between his shrieks and scratching at the air around his body. I got off the bed and tried to grab him again, but he was flailing around so hard, I couldn't stop him. I got a hold of his wrists at one point and he looked at me and howled ""nooo"" again and then threw himself backwards away from me. His eyes had registered me again and I got a feeling that he was horrified to have me near him, in a protective sort of way. I grabbed at him again and because it looked like he was most concerned with something being on his back, I used my body to maneuver/push him into the bedroom door. His whole body jerked again on one side, and as I grabbed his face to make him look at me, I felt something change in the air. He stopped screaming and kind of froze up and his eyes looked past me. Then after a moment, he was fine/coherent (though still entirely shaken up). I took my hands off from him and we looked at each other. He asked me if I was okay, looking from me to the side of the bed repeatedly. I looked too but again I saw nothing there. He stared in that direction for a few seconds, and then suddenly his attention was completely on me. He wouldn't answer at first whether or not he was okay but kept inquiring about me. He was oddly intense about it and right after he stopped looking toward the bedside, he immediately got calm, stopped breathing hard, and what bothered me the most, smiley. Like, it's a lovely day and oh, you should've seen the funny thing that happened at work smiley. I can't put my finger on it, but it truly disturbed me. 

Trying to absorb everything that just happened, trying to grasp exactly what it was that happened, and being terrified it was going to happen again,  I started to cry. He tried to console me and I flinched, realizing that I half expected my bf to attack me. The danger feeling hadn't gone away, only shifted. I just don't understand why or where but it still hasn't gone away entirely. 

He wouldn't explain what happened for awhile. I gave it some time and then pressed him again before he left for work. He said he thought he felt a bug crawling on him. When I said it must've been a pretty big bug, he thought a minute and said it felt like a lot of bugs. I asked him where they were crawling and he said it was mostly near his ass, and then laughed a little. While I happened to wake up to feeling my head matted with bugs, him saying similar didn't exactly explain what he was clawing or looking at. I should add that I hadn't told him about my bug experience yet, and no, there wasn't actually any bugs around. When I tried to ask him more about it, he waved me off and told me not to worry about it, that it was just a bad dream, still smilely and nonchalant. It's possible he was just trying to put me (or himself) at ease, but it did not work. 

For the record, I know all about sleep terrors. My ex of 6 years had them very violently. When it wasn't involving violence towards himself, he often had a sadistic streak towards me. I know how awake a person can seem, how real that fear is. That ex did everything from pulling me off the bed to save me from giant maggots, smoking cigarettes and having active conversations, to flat out trying to kill me more times than I care to remember. This whole thing felt like something entirely different, though I know my saying so is not proof of anything. It also matters to me that in the four+ years we've been together, my current bf has never experienced them (and has no known history of them before our relationship). My ex had them regularly and his family had countless stories about them while growing up. His live-in brother had them too, but not violent and very seldom. That doesn't make me an expert by any means, but familiar enough with it to notice that my bf now showed no confusion, disorientation, or memory loss about the event. Just an avoidance to discuss it. 

I've read all about sleep paralysis too and though I've never experienced it myself, the possibility did cross my mind when I was staring at that inhuman face. But I moved, several times. I felt no pressure on my chest, I didn't feel locked down in anyway, there really wasn't any of the usual symptoms other than having been on my back and seeing such a terrifying, nightmarish thing. My thoughts were ignored in comparison to a greatly heightened instinct, but they were very much cognitive and not dream like in the slightest. 

That being said, I don't have a clue on what we experienced. My brain keeps wanting to write it off somehow and if anyone out there has an idea of what happened, please let me know. It felt good writing this out, explaining it without worrying too much about sounding crazy. I feel crazy, in the sense that I can't wrap my mind around it all. I'm still jumpy and incredibly uneasy. I'm dreading tonight. I don't want to go back into the bed room, but I'm just as afraid to leave him in there alone and maybe if I'm being honest with myself, I'm a little afraid of him. Like I said, there's been some other stuff that's happened before this and it only adds to my worry, but I'm not going to bother getting into it. It's probably not related and this post is quite long enough. So, that's it I guess. Thanks for listening. I hope I've made enough sense for anyone willing to.

He lived in a fairly nice house with his family. In this village, there was an old man who was known to be suffering from various forms of  dementia. One day, this old man knocked on the door of my friend's house. When my friend's father answered the door, the old man asked if he could purchase the house. My friend's father politely refused, and the old man went away. The next day, the old man returned. This time offering a greater sum of money to purchase the house. Once again, my friend's father said no. Over the course of the next week, the old man returned every day, offering a greater sum of money to buy the house, and everyday my friend's father turned him down. Finally, my friend's father asked the old man why he wanted to buy the house. The old man claimed that there was a treasure buried 2 feet beneath the tree in the house's courtyard. My friend's entire family dismissed him as crazy, and eventually forgot about him.

This is where things get interesting. One month after the old man's visits stopped, there was a water pipe leakage in the house. The plumber determined the site of the leak to be under the tree in the courtyard. When the plumber dug beneath the tree to fix the pipe, he found a small wooden chest. 

Inside the wooden chest were gold coins dating back to the early 1800s. My friend's family decided to keep the chest of coins inside the house. The chest remained in the house for several weeks, until one day it was no longer there. They searched everywhere for it, but couldn't find it.

Later on, they came to learn that the old man who frequently visited them earlier on had died. After some inquiry, they found out that the day the chest disappeared from their house was the same day the old man died.

[ME][FAM],Pincheded,41,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1f1mzx/legend_of_bill_sketoe_mefam/,"So, there is an urban legend of a guy named Bill Sketoe here in Alabama. It happens that Sketoe died by hanging off of a tree and he was tall so the people that dug him had to dig a hole so he would actually hang.
The legend is, is that if you fill the hole that the people dug, it wouldn't stay filled.

 So one day, my mother and I (I was about 11) took and camping trip by the site and filled the hole with rocks. At night we made a fire, set up our tent, and read scary stories. We eventually went to sleep and the next morning we checked out the hole. The rocks weren't there. So we thought people have drove by and removed the rocks while we were sleeping. (The site not that far from the highway and there is a rest area right beside hole.)

We decided to camp out another night and put rocks in the hole again to see if it would stay recovered. We went to bed and the next day the hole was empty once again.

I have a [Wikipedia link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Sketoe) if anybody wants more information on this urban legend.

1365536337.0,35,self.Thetruthishere,1c0d42,[FoF] My friend told me the story a few days ago. Thought it belonged here. Video included.,tetewhyelle,51,16,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1c0d42/fof_my_friend_told_me_the_story_a_few_days_ago/,"So this story freaks me the hell out in general. I didn't even really want to click on the youtube video to get the link for you lovely lads and ladies, but I did it! So hopefully this isn't for nothing. I'm a little fuzzy on most the details but I'll tell you what I remember and let you watch the video and decide for yourself. If you want any more details, the friend who told me the story is my roommate so I can ask her when she gets home from work. =)

So basically, my friend was living in Savannah, GA for a while and as I'm sure most you Americans know, that's supposed to be one of the most haunted cities in the U.S.. She was friends with this guy named Charlie, who is the original poster of the video and seen in the video a few times. Charlie lived in what she called a 'boarding house'. From what I understand, it's like 4 bedrooms that have like key locks, but they all share a living room and a kitchen. Which is somewhat shown in the video. 

Apparently nobody ever lives there for very long and the place is always for sale because they can't keep residents very long (wonder why). So Charlie and three of his friends ended up renting the place while they attend SCAD. One of the friends was a girl and records show that she is probably the first female to ever live in the house because it used to be some kind of boys home or something. The four of them started experiencing really strange phenomena and did it Paranormal Activity style and used their mac computer to record video all day, every day.

So the girl, had an iPhone with some music on it. One of the songs was the short little song, Blood by My Chemical Romance. That song is creepy enough in general, but supposedly her phone would randomly just start playing that song even though it was dead or turned off. It would boot up, play the song, then shut off again. Like we're talking random times to. From what I remember, it happened like in the middle of the night or like during the day. Really sporadic. It also I guess happen almost every time they talked about the weird stuff going on. But only while she was in the house. Never at school or while she was home visiting family. Eventually she deleted the song off her phone for obvious reasons and I think may have even gotten a new phone at some point and it still played the song...even though it had been deleted from her phone. 

I guess the ghost had a thing for her because it messed with her more than the guys. She would wake up to find her room had been ransacked while she was sleeping, she'd leave her room to go to the kitchen and the door would close and lock behind her, and her bath tub would randomly fill up with water and over flow. I think a lot of times her belongings would be in the bathtub. Some other stuff happened, but I'll let the video show you that. What ended up causing her to move out was one day she came home from class and her bathroom was flooded and all of her clothes were in the bathtub.

The guys would also experience weird stuff too. Apparently, the temperature would always get set to something really cold and they'd come home to find this one chair right in front of the thermostat every day. I guess it would get turned down at night too. The boys doors would constantly open and slam shut in the middle of the night despite the doors being locked. So they started sleeping with their doors open. Charlie apparently had his lights flickering on and off one night. Like he'd turn it off, go lay down, and they'd come back on. So he yelled at the guy across the hall to see if he was messing with him and the guy said no and his lights were doing it too. So Charlie got up (still dark) to go talk to the roommate and as he was leaving, his art kit for school went whizzing by his head, narrowly missing it. He looked in the corner that it had come from and at first thought he saw a trashbag in the corner, but realized he was staring at some sort of a figure, so he high tailed it the fuck out of there.

That's all the stuff I can remember for now, but I'll answer any questions you guys have to the best of my abilities. So, without further adieu, here's the video of Andy the Ghost. You'll see why they call him Andy.

Edit: For clarity and to also add some details I forgot. There's a part in the video where they are in the kitchen with a water bottle bong. I don't condone that activity, but thats what they were doing. The top apparently shot off like it had been squeezed too hard, all the smoke just disappeared and apparently the water just vanished.

Someone asked for a picture of the thing and I finally managed to get it drawn. This is the purple and black thing I saw (and please pardon my artz, I couldn't fully capture what about him was scary): [Imgur](http://imgur.com/qsxnOro)

It also visited me again. It was probably because I was thinking about it. But this past week I was in Boston for PAX East, and had insomnia. I was up late (reading Penpal by Dathan Auerbach. You know, feel-good reading) when I hear this wheezing noise come from the short hallway near the bathroom. I stop reading and automatically pull every limb under the bedsheets, staring in the direction of the noise. 

Sure enough, it comes squalling out of the front hallway, running at my side of the bed and gnashing it's teeth. It looks PISSED. I reach out to shove it away, *and the thing tries to bite me!!* I'm so shocked I jerk my hand back and move away from the side of the bed while it sits there growling and wheezing at me.

My husband, meanwhile, is fast asleep and not reacting to any of this.
It starts scratching at the bed, and I get angry because I didn't want to see this thing again and he was now definitely trying to hurt me.
I finally sit up, look at it straight in the eyes and (remembering what happened before) said ""Get the fuck out of here! I don't want you here! You aren't welcome! LEAVE NOW.""

It shifts from leg to leg for a second, glaring at me, then slowly fades away.

As soon as it's gone, my husband wakes up, rolls over and asks me why I was yelling. I lie and tell him I thought I'd lost something, but remembered where it was. He doesn't really believe in ghosts and spirits, so I just kept it to myself.

1360186678.0,31,self.Thetruthishere,180ufm,[Me] A scar that doesn't have a logical story,sharkbaitzero,38,7,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/180ufm/me_a_scar_that_doesnt_have_a_logical_story/,"I've lurked here for a little while now and finally decided to share one of my stories. This is kind of tl;dr, so I'll summarize up here. I saw three things that defy logic in my room one night and woke up the next morning with a scar on my stomach.

When I was almost 16 (28 now for some reference) my mom, step dad, and I lived in a little community in a canyon. It was a two story house with history going back to the Texas-Indian wars. I was friends with most of the other people my age in the area and a few of them were wiccan. It was through them that I developed an interest in the occult. We tried a few 'summonings' but since nothing ever happened I wrote it off as fake.

I was an only child from my mom (my parents divorced when I was three) so I had the entire upstairs to myself. It was a friday night and I was up late watching cartoon network. I turned the tv off and rolled over to face the wall to try and get some sleep. All of the sudden my tv turned itself back on. I didn't know why it did that so I just turned it back off with the remote. But before I could roll over it was back on again, this time the only thing showing was the white static of a dead signal. I reached for the remote again but it turned itself off before I could do it. Then the tv turned off and on rapidly a few times before staying on. By this point I was more than a little unnerved, especially since the channel was now on one we didn't get. Religious programming coming in clear. It was something from the Catholic church talking about demons, an interest I had back then but not something I wanted to be educated about by the church. About 10 minutes passed and I got more irritated than unnerved by the fact that my electronics weren't behaving as I thought they should. I reached for the remote and turned the tv off again, almost daring it to come on. Thankfully it did so I rolled over and tried to go to sleep. It was an old wooden house so there were a lot of random creaks but having lived there for so long I knew where each one was. One in particular was beside the futon I used as a couch. It wasn't out of the ordinary for my mom to come and gripe at me for being up so late so I looked back over expecting to see her. I didn't see anything and I realized that I didn't hear my door open. I stared at the spot for a few minutes before a shape leaned around my futon to look at me. It looked...well...like an imp for lack of a better way to describe it. It couldn't have been more than three feet tall. Then I noticed an unnaturally thin, unnaturally tall thing standing near my doorway, leaned over because it was too tall for the room. Both were watching me and not moving. By this point I was starting to get scared, but I didn't move or say anything. I knew that it couldn't be just my imagination because plenty of moonlight was coming through the window in front of the futon. My room was rectangular with the window and door on the opposite side of the wall where my bed was with the futon in the middle. These things seemed to defy the moonlight because I couldn't see much more than shadowy forms even though the rest of my room was relatively well lit. The third figure was just icing on the cake. It was huge and looking into my room from the second story window. There wasn't a balcony or ledge for anything to be standing on. The tall thing and the big thing both looked like their heads had a bunch of jagged horns coming out of them. That or they were crowns of some sort. They didn't make any moves towards me but I got a feeling that they weren't exactly nice. Then after I blinked they were gone. I got up and turned on a light but there was no trace that anything was there. I tried to force myself to stay awake but eventually I passed out. The next morning I thought nothing of it all until I went to get in the shower and noticed a pinkish scar on my stomach. It's just to the right of my belly button and goes from slightly above my waist to right under my diaphragm at an angle. My parents had no idea about it and couldn't provide any explanation.

Fast forward to when I was 25. I told the story to a good friend of mine that I made in the Army, one who said he knew a lot about things of that nature. After I showed him the scar he got a scared and confused look on his face and kept asking me how I was still alive. When I tried to push for more information he just shook his head and walked away, not wanting to continue the conversation. I still can't get him to tell me what he knows. I was kind of hoping that maybe someone here could help.

**EDIT** I have some other stories I can share if anyone is interested.

From what I remember, there weren't any creepy things occurring in our town house and nothing strange happened prior to or after this night. 
Let me explain the layout of the upstairs: At the end of the hallway was my brother's room, my room was directly to the left, and my mom's was right across of mine. I always slept with my door wide open (I felt safer, I don't know why lol), and with the way my bed was positioned, I could see both my mom and brother's rooms/doors. 

In the middle of the night, I woke up. I sat up a little and looked out my doorway, and that's where I saw someone, or something, in front of my mom's bedroom door (she slept with it closed and always locked her door). My brother's bedroom door was also open, and it let in light from the street lamp through his window and into the hallway. Even with the light, this figure was pitch black. 
I was, and still am, fairly fearless of most things. I was more curious than scared of what it was. I could hear it jiggling my mom's door, trying to get inside. I was interested and confused, and so I kept watching. After a few moments, I called out ""hello?"" and the figure stopped for a moment, and continued to try to open the door. Then I actually got out of bed, to get a closer look. As I crept forward, I said ""hello?"" again. The figure looked like it turned towards me, and furiously continued to open the door. 

I really couldn't tell you why I kept trying to talk to it and walk closer, but as I did, it stopped, and zoomed into my brother's room. At that point I got a little freaked out because I couldn't see it anymore. After standing in the middle of my room for a couple minutes, I decided to peek into my brother's room.

I went inside, and saw nothing except my brother sleeping in his bed. There was no trace of that black figure. I found it peculiar, and I could never come up with an explanation. Even though it happened years ago, it definitely stuck and still keeps me curious. I still wondered why it wanted to get into my mom's room so badly, and I wonder what would've happened if her door were unlocked",,False,,t5_2sntx,1356780612.0,,,True,t3_15mdma,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/15mdma/i_dont_really_know_what_it_was_or_what_it_wanted/,

Also, my creativity is shit so I apologize about the not so appealing title. This story is, to my knowledge, completely 100% true. My mother told me it when I was young and I would frequently ask her to repeat it for my friends around Halloween &amp; after seeing all of these other “true” stories on r/nosleep &amp; **true** stories on r/thetruthishere I decided, hell, I’ll contribute too. With that being said, here we go. 

My aunt and uncle live in a very old house in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Everyone knows the basic creepiness of an old house. Creeks, squeaks, stray breezes &amp; what not. Apparently this house had a lot of “bumps in the night”. The house was originally the school house for a family that now has a hospital in the area named after them. My aunt &amp; uncle had two children, a girl named Anna &amp; an older son named Richie. One night when Anna was about 7 or 8 she woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of her door creaking open, she looked up and saw a dark figure but thinking it was only her father checking up on her she rolled over and went back to sleep. A few nights later she woke up again in the middle of the night to the sound of someone rustling through her things on her dresser. She rolled over and saw the same dark figure. She thought it was her older brother Richie so she sleepily asked him what he was doing but he didn’t respond, he just walked out of the room. The next morning at breakfast Anna asked Richie what he was doing in the room the previous night, but he said that he hadn’t gone in there. She told him that she knew he was lying because she clearly saw him over by her dresser, but he swore up and down that it wasn’t him. Her mom and dad kind of just laughed telling her that maybe it was a ghost. 

That next night she woke up again, but to the sound of her jewelry box on her dresser playing a song. She was pissed off thinking that it was just Richie trying to scare her. She got up, closed the jewelry box and turned around to get back in bed when she saw the same dark figure on the other side of her bed in front of the window. It blocked most of the light coming in through the window but she could see through it. Needless to say she freaked the fuck out, turned on the light &amp; the figure was gone. She told her family about what she had seen but they were very skeptical, she was quite young and I guess they assumed that it was just her imagination. Although she never felt as though it was going to hurt her or felt threatening or anything I can guess it was still really freaky to sleep in your room when you know there’s something else in there with you, so from what my mom told me she slept with her light on for many many years, till she was in her late thirties and was married and living with her husband. But the story doesn't end here. 

You know how I said I was going to circle back? Well here we go. My uncle was renovating one of the rooms on the third floor of the house &amp; was going to remove one of the walls. When he started taking the wall down he found a few really old shot guns, some papers signed by a Brian and a few pictures of a woman. Thinking they were pretty cool considering they were pretty old, they framed them and put them on their fireplace mantle. 
Now Anna was in her 20’s when this discovery was made and one day my mother decided to stop in and say hello and what not. After talking for a bit she saw a picture on the mantle and said how lovely of a picture of Anna that was &amp; asked when it was taken because it seemed to be very old. As you can probably guess, the picture was not of Anna, It was in fact a picture of the Teacher that used to teach the children in the house while it was the school house. 

They had brought the pictures and papers to the township’s history office (or wherever they keep the old files, the name has slipped my mind at the moment) &amp; had been informed that the picture of the woman was the school teacher and the groundskeeper, whose name was Brian, had been in love with her when she died suddenly. Because of her death Brian later committed suicide in the house.

Because of the very striking resemblance between Anna &amp; the school teacher they assumed that the figure that she had seen was Brian. He had probably thought that his love was back so he went to her. It kind of became a little joke within the family that Anna had a ghostly admirer, and now that there was some reasoning why he was there, she felt a little better about the whole situation although she confessed that she never stopped feeling his presence around her.

Years later when Anna and my mom were both in their 40’s my mom visited her at her house which was only about two blocks from her mother and fathers house. Creepily enough the house’s back yard was a very small grave yard. (Things are always happening in that house, I’ve personally witnessed a few odd things but getting back to the main story). My mom and Anna were catching up when my mom brought up Brian and jokingly asked her if she’d seen him lately, or felt his presence when suddenly the blinds that were down covering the door shot up, scaring the shit out of my mom and startling Anna. Apparently they just started laughing and Anna said “Hello Brian”

So, I decided my next post should be written more down to earth and provide proof that I do in fact ""do work."" What better then my incidents at Day of the Dead?)

In my house there are 3 holy days: Halloween, All Saints Day, and Day of the Dead. The three days are very important, for we believe these are the days when the spirits are closest to we the living. On Halloween all the spirits are set free and allowed to roam and do as they please, on All Saints Day we honor those brave spirits who's love for humanity transcends the mortal coil and even their own Ancestral line. But Day of the Dead! This is the most important. The Ancestors come close and the Dead seek out their descendants. For the final day, our loved ones are closest to us before the boundaries that separate us are put back up. On this day we honor our own Ancestors with prayers and a dinner, and we take offerings to the cemetery(A candle, liquor, tobacco, candy, and homemade food). We thank them for all their service, for literally making us who we are, and praying for those poor souls who are no longer honored or visited by their descendants.

My GF and I have been dating for 4 years, and she's seen all I do. The altars, the prayers, speaking in different voices when I do my work. She's not sure what she believes but she's seen enough to at least know Spirits exist. So, she decides she wants to be apart of the ceremony. I think she's at least ready to do this, so I agree.

First Day of the Dead, 2009 at Melbourne Fl cemetery, goes off without a hitch. GF feels a hand on her shoulder, but she gets a sense it's warm and comforting. I think she's got it down.

Come 2010. We decide this time to drive out to Crooked Mile Cemetery(also known as Georgiana Cemetery), the oldest one in the area. I have the idea we go down on both Day of the Dead and Halloween. Figure we'll welcome them as they loose their bonds. Just as a little heads up, as I was researching a little history on the area(and keep in mind what we were doing) I come across this little gem on the internet:

*""Consider, if you will, the old Georgiana Cemetery along Crooked Mile Road on Merritt Island. Georgiana was one of the earliest settlements in the area and was once the hub of commercial activity on Merritt Island. The cemetery dates back to the 18th century and includes a number of unmarked graves. Local folklore holds that the cemetery is a place where people conduct private rituals to honor, and some say contact, long deceased relatives. Stories of the unthinkable, including hands protruding from the ground, are numerous indeed...""*

So we go inside, of course at night. We sit down and are waiting for things to start bumping before I say my greetings. Not soon after we start to hear leaves rustling, but there's no wind. I don't know how to describe it, but it sounded like things moving. First slowly, like waking up, and then more quickly. I feel a welcoming presence, like friends happy to see me. GF feels something **far** different. She kept saying she didn't want to be there, that they weren't happy she was here. I tell her to stay, they won't hurt her. But the leaves start sounding like shuffling, and we think we see a light. Shes shaking now and begs me to get her out of there. I reluctantly(and admittedly pissed) say fine and we leave. She feels really bad and swears it won't happen on Day of the Dead. She says she felt as if the Dead were all staring at her, that they felt like she didn't belong there. After some thought, I consider this quite possible. Anywho she agrees to go on Day of the Dead.

We arrive with our supplies. GF takes a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/848jJ) to show what it looks like before the ceremony. We expected to see some orbs, so no surprise. We place the [offering](http://i.imgur.com/39FN2) down and she takes another picture. Here I say my prayers and the energy gets ""tight."" Not evil, not bad, not even mean. GF felt very calm. Just as if we had sort of ""charged"" their batteries.

We pause for a few moments and GF decides to take another picture where the first one was. [See here.](http://i.imgur.com/0JIKf) HELL of alot more activity. [She turns right and takes a picture.](http://i.imgur.com/P9ulz) [She turns further to the right and takes another](http://i.imgur.com/JkalN) Lots of activity. So we sit there quiet and start hearing noises. Walking, shuffling, branches creaking, but more like they wanted to make a noise to let us know they appreciated the gesture of kindness and offering. After all, the offerings empower them. So as we sit there and hear this really strange noise behind us. The only way I can describe it is something coming out of the ground and crawling. We both look behind and see this weird blue streak thing. She snaps a picture quickly. [Notice the blue orb right next to the grave and seems more solid.](http://i.imgur.com/0S5To) After that she was pretty much a little weirded out and we left. I thought the pictures were cool, but nothing unnerved me.

More was to come.

Fast forward next year's holy days. No car, so no Crooked Mile. We spend Halloween at home, I spend All Saints Day in prayer, and Day of the Dead comes up. We have our dinner and honor our Ancestors, and then I say that since we don't have a car I'll have to walk to the Melbourne cemetary. 5 miles there, 5 miles back. GF is against it, long way to walk. I say I have to do it. She understands, I head out.

I walk with this year's offerings, though no camera(broken). After awhile I reach the graveyard. Now, I should have known something was up. Right when I reached the cemetery a train passed by. Significance? Trains have a long history in blues(which mentions alot of Hoodoo) as omens of death. Also:

*Also known as Oggun, Ogum, Ogu, and in Voodoo as Ogoun. Ogun is the Spirit of Iron, the Divine Blacksmith. Because of his work at the forge he is an orisha of industry and technology...and also the locomotive train because of the amount of iron used and because of the tremendous almost unstoppable force of a train.* Altogether an omen of the Dead having alot of power.

After the train passes I walk to the entrance and ask for permission to enter, leaving a dime at the entrance. I wait until I feel I have been given permission and enter. Now there I am, planning to go to the cemetery center and leave my offering at a crossroads there.

NOPE.

I was alone, full moon up, and started feeling scared. There air was static and unearthly quiet. No cars passing by. I reach a crossroads and decide this is far enough. I put my offerings down and begin to make prayers. For some reason the wind is high and keeps blowing it out. Natural, as this place is close to the water so I relight it everytime. I even say something like ""I'm trying guys. Keep the wind off me so you can have your candle."" For a little while the wind does die down and I can finish my prayers. Being alone, and kind of scared, rather then stick around I head out to leave.

Remember the bit about the omen I missed? Yeah, well as I'm stepping out the *same* train comes back down the tracks(which are actually right next to the cemetary) *going the other way.* I think, oh that's funny, and continue to walk across the road and stop by the sidewalk. I suddenly realize I can't leave without closing the ritual and I look back and say my goodbyes.

Now I'm across the street, looking at where the candle is burning. I can see the skyline in between two trees, so I have a pretty big window looking towards the sky while still looking in to the cemetery.

What happened next spooked me so much my whole body seized up, *pulling my groin muscle.* 

Luckily even in fright I continued my closing. So what did I see? The darkest pitch black outline of a **large** ""human being,"" head and shoulders clearly outlined against the sky, *heading towards my offering.* I finished my thanks and walked double time back home.

There were several unexplainable and strange occurrences during the two years we lived there, but I'll stick to the first one that happened to me.  Our bedroom was in the middle of a long hallway and we often slept with the door open so our dog could go in and out during the night. There was a light usually left on at the end of the hallway, so there was always a dim light shining into the bedroom.  One night around 2am I woke up, which was not unusual for me at the time. I lay there as I contemplated getting up to go to the bathroom and spent a few moments waking up fully. Suddenly, I saw a man standing at the foot of the bed, in the shadows. I was so terrified, I froze. Even in the semi-dark, I could make out his features clearly; medium height, kind of stocky. He had dark, thick hair cut kind of short and wore dark pants and a white t-shirt. He had a large nose, and thin lips and his eyes were dark.  His overall presence seemed very menacing, though that could have come from my own terror at waking up to find someone in my room.
He turned and started walking around the foot of the bed, up the side nearest me. As he got a little closer, he was walking further into the light from the hallway and just suddenly disappeared. 

I didn't mention this incident to either my gf or my sister, as I figured they would just assume I was having an extremely vivid dream. At the time, and even until today, I've never doubted I saw a spirit that night. A few months later I got even more confirmation.  My sister's 3 year old son was staying the weekend with us and as they were going to bed in her room...which shares a wall with our room,,,he suddenly threw himself against his mom, buried his face in her shoulder and asked ""Who is that man that walked through the wall?"".  He was quite scared for some time and being so young, it was hard for his mom to get much info from him except that he saw a ""strange man"" walk from their room, through the wall into what was my room.

I never believed in the paranormal as a kid and throughout most of my teen 
years.... until one night that made me a firm believer. I was a normal 16 year old high 
school girl. Made decent grades, played video games, hung out with my best friend and 
stayed out of trouble. I decided to introduce my best friend, Ali, to one of my favorite old 
school PC games: American McGee's Alice.... a totally morbid and macabre game based 
off the story of Alice in Wonderland. She loved the game almost more than I did. She 
would draw creepy pictures of Alice and the Cheshire cat, quote it and watch me play 
almost every time she came over. At this same time, she started to change. She became 
fascinated with the whole ""Wicca"" thing and started practicing it: Dressing in black, 
wearing pentagrams, even took a whole day of silence. I didnt understand or really ask 
about it too much... honestly I didnt care or judge, it was what she wanted to do.

One day she surprised me at school by pulling a figure out of her messenger bag of 
Alice, accompanied by the Cheshire cat. http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2145/2424936613_5cb82cd9a5.jpg Whoa! I thought it was the coolest thing ever seeing 
as I was a big fan. Actually, I was kind of jealous! I had no idea there were collectable 
figures. I wanted them too! A few weeks had passed and as always, I walked out of my 
Algebra 2 class to her waiting for me. She looked a bit uneasy and before I could say
 anything she handed me a note. I dont remember exactly what it said, but it was along 
the lines of ""I need to talk to you about something... privately. Not over the phone or in 
public."" Naturally, this alarmed me... I didnt know what to expect. Her step dad wasnt the
 nicest guy Id ever met... did he hit her? Omg what if he's doing worse?! All sorts of ""omg 
what if...?"" questions started whizzing around my head and made waiting for lunch almost
 torture. When I met up with her, she took me by the arm and led me behind the art 
building at the limits of campus. I proceeded to ask if she was ok... she said she was fine,
 but was very scared of going home. I instantly thought her step dad was being an 
asshole again. I hated the guy and was ready to pounce on an opportunity to give him 
what he deserved. She swore up and down that she wasnt making this up and if I didnt 
believe her, she'd show me proof...Then she began to tell me about her Wicca practices. 
Immediately I put on my poker face and listened. She told me about one particular 
practice that she did called ""spirit writing"", which to my understanding is pretty much 
inviting your ""spirit guardian"" to control your hand and answer the questions that you 
write. Of course the first thing that popped in my head was ""What the hell.... you scared 
the shit out of me for nothing"". I kept listening though... She told me the names and ages 
of her ""spirit guardians"", what they looked like, where they were from and just vast 
amounts of details about them. It seemed that one of them, who she called Suzanne, 
liked the Alice figure she had shown me a few weeks ago.

Ali's room was about 10x12 with her door in the corner, the parallel wall housing a book case, 
adjacent to the closet doors just a foot or two away. The bookcase was 
roughly 10 feet from the door and the floor was carpeted, keep this in mind... Ali told me 
Suzanne ""played"" with this figure everytime Ali would leave the room. Progressively it had 
gotten to the point to where she hadnt even stepped out of her door completely before 
turning to see the doll gone from its perch on the bookcase and at her feet.  ""Ok, shes 
lost her goddamn mind"" I thought to myself, just staring at her and trying to keep a 
straight face. I wanted to believe her, I really did, but come on. Spirit writing? An already 
creepy doll moving on its own? Whatever. But, she was my bestie and I couldnt find it in 
my disbelieving heart to call bullshit. So I told her I would stay with her over the weekend 
if it really scared her that much. I even offered to help her research on how to fix the 
""problem"" So the weekend came and I went home with her from school. As we walked in, 
her mom was in the kitchen cooking something that smelled amazing. I took Ali's stuff 
from her and carried it to her room as she started talking to her mom in the kitchen. I 
opened the door, tossed her messenger bag on her bed and turned to the bookcase. I slid 
off my backpack and put it in front of the closet doors like I always did. I straightened up 
and looked at the Alice doll that adorned the top shelf. I just... stared at it. Almost felt 
like I was making eye contact with it. Slowly I turned and walked away to join Ali and her 
mother in the kitchen.

We were talking and eating for roughly half an hour. None of us had left each 
others sight. Ali and I started talking about our art projects as her mom started washing 
dishes. I wanted to show her what I had done so far on my piece and hopped off the bar 
stool to go to her room. The door was ajar, just how Id left it. I had forgotten all about 
the Alice doll and its creepy vibe... until I walked in and saw immediately that it was not 
on the shelf anymore. I paused in mid-step, utterly confused. I spun in place, eyes 
darting all over the floor, trying to find Alice. I checked all the shelves on the bookcase, I
 looked under the bed, nothing. Finally I poked my head out of the doorway. ""Uh, Ali? 
Could you come here a second?"" She walked in and noticed what was wrong. She did the 
exact same thing I did: spun around looking, checking under the bed, going through the 
shelves, looking everywhere! Suddenly it hit me. I locked onto my backpack. ""No.... thats 
not possible...."" I kneeled down and grabbed a strap. It was almost painful to lift... but 
there it was. Alice was underneath my bag. ""No fucking way.... how the fuck?"" After a 
moment of well... just staring again, Ali let out a nervous laugh ""Do you believe me now?"" 
My mind ran through all the possibilities it could. ""The wind knocked it over. Someone put 
it there when I wasnt looking. It was there in the first place."" Ok, first off, the windows 
are closed. Secondly, I was with the only other people in the house the whole time. 
Thirdly.... well, I know that bitch was on the shelf the first time I came in. Ali placed Alice 
back on the shelf, with the Chesire cat in front as a prop. I sat in pure disbelief of what 
had just happened. I couldnt think of an explanation. I shook off my creeped out feelings 
and proceeded to do what I originally intended to do.

A few hours later, I completely forgot about the doll again. Ali and I were talking 
and drawing. Her mom popped in to tell us she was going to the store and as soon as she 
left, we bolted into the kitchen for icecream. We loaded up our bowls and returned to her 
room. Alice was gone again. But this time, I nearly stepped on her! She was at the 
doorway, nearly 10 feet away from the bookcase! ""What the hell!?"" I almost dropped my 
icecream and jumped back into Ali, almost knocking her over. She scooped Alice up and 
once again positioned her on the bookcase. Alright, alright! I believe you now! I was 
actually kind of pissed at this point. I wanted to know what the hell was going on. So I 
suggested we perform a few experiments on the bookcase. We bumped it, we threw 
things at it, blew on it, jumped really hard next to it, knocked the walls, opened doors, 
opened windows, EVERYTHING we possibly could to get this doll to fall and the only time 
it even budged was when I took my shoulder to the side of the shelf. Even then, it did 
not bounce on the carpeted floor. How the fuck was it getting aaaaaaall the way to the 
door and furthermore, UNDER MY BOOKBAG?!

The rest of the night, Alice fell off the shelf right on que as we left the room to help 
Ali's mom with groceries, when we went to watch TV, when we went swimming. Every. 
Single. Time. Sometimes she would be a few feet away, still in front of the closet, other 
times shed be almost in the doorway. We spoke nothing of it and just put her back on the 
shelf. I didnt want to think about it anymore, it was maddening trying to think of a logical 
reason. I didnt want to admit that it scared me and I DEFINITELY didnt want to admit 
that it might be a spirit or whatever moving this thing.

Finally, it was bedtime. Ali and I lay there in the dark, talking and gossiping like 16 
year old girls do, trying to stay up as late as we possibly could. It was cold, so we were 
under a big feather comforter... I loved that blanket. I was in the middle of my sentence 
when a rattling sound interrupted me. At first, I was confused... then I realized that it 
was coming from the bookcase. I completely froze... and I could feel that Ali had done 
the same. 30 seconds straight of no breathing or moving and the loudest pulse Id ever 
heard in my life pounding in my ears almost deafening me to the rattling on the shelf. Ali 
sprung up and yanked the chain on the fan to turn on the light. She leaped from the bed 
and snatched the doll off the shelf, yanked open her trunk, threw Alice in and slammed 
the lid shut, attaching a combination lock.Ali left her in the trunk for 3 months. When 
Alice was returned to the shelf, she never fell again. I guess ""Suzanne"" learned that she 
wasnt allowed to play with Alice anymore. The activity didnt stop there at all. Weird and 
crazy shit continued until almost the end of my junior year, but those are stories for 
another day. Even now, 8 years later, I can still recall the fear I felt perfectly that night 
and how it changed my whole life. Sometimes, I wonder if it'll ever happen to me again... 
and in some way... I hope it does.


tl;dr: Best friend starts practicing Wicca, her doll starts moving for no reason and scares the FUCK out of us.

--------------------------
Hey guys,

Now, before we begin, let me add a disclaimer: I have shared my stories here before. They were done under another username and were titled ""The Spiral, the Lady, and the Door."" Just FYI in case you have read it. I have lost the post, and it was done in haste anyway, so I am going to try to take my time to rewrite it. I don't like to think about these things while at home so I only have a limited time to work on 'em. For this reason, I may take time to finish this post through further edits. 

I am going to post about my first two encounters, for they are light. I will then either update this post, or make a new one for my third: The Door. So this next section can be subtitled:

**""The Spiral and the Lady.""**

Ever since I can remember, my mind has been full of vivid horrors. My first memory is a nightmare I had where this doll, which I feared, had locked someone up in my basement. I went down to the basement to try to unlock him from the crate he was in, but as I did, the door opened, and I saw the fucking doll descending the steps and looking at me. That, that is my first damned memory.

Still, I am a skeptic. To the bone. I swear to you, I never believed in Santa. I caught my parents when I was like six since I was so suspicious. I hate being fooled. Hate it. And not just that, but I am a man of science. Science is my life. I have to mention that. And you will see that I stayed true to my skepticism even during these events.

Once, while trying to sleep on my bed in El Salvador, I saw a faint spiral. I had a view of my parent's bedroom door straight ahead, and I noticed it since I was awake and bored as hell. Everyone else had already fallen asleep. 

The spiral was extremely faint. So faint that I could hardly tell it was there. So faint that, had you told me I was hallucinating, I would have agreed. It looked like an eye floatie. But it wasn't one. It was fixed in the middle of my parents door, and it would wind into itself slowly. It wasn't big. It was about five inches, maybe three, across. It would spin, spin, spin, like water in a toilet, and then it would disappear. Not a second later it would come back in full form. I sat there watching it. I remember thinking it was strange, and thinking it may be ""gathering."" I dropped the thought and fell asleep.'

The next morning, while having breakfast, I mentioned this to my younger sister and my mom. The moment I did, my sister looked up at me in surprise, and said she had seen it too. I, of course, wasn't buying it, so I asked her to give me the details. And she did. You bet she did. She traced the spiral in the air while describing how it would wind into itself, disappear, and come back up. It was on my parents' door, and she saw it while laying in bed awake. 

I'll admit, it surprised me, but for some reason, I didn't think of it much then. I filed it away as strange, but nothing special. I was a kid, then, maybe 12 years old. I had nothing to fear, I thought. Not in my home especially.

I have never, not ever returned to that feeling. I am older now, an adult, and I have something to fear, especially at my own home.

And this is all due to this next encounter. You see, I only mention the spiral because a year or so later, I had a terrifying, traumatizing encounter, and I get the feeling that these two are related. I'll share my baseless opinion: That spiral was the lady, or her energy, and it was gathering. 

So let's move on to the lady.

Fuck. This is the image that is furthest in my head. When I die, I will think of this. I am serious. 

A year or so later, my bed had been repositioned against the far wall. I had no view of my parents' bedroom doors. Instead, my bed faced the wall next to the door. I had a diagonal view of the hallway and the top of the stairs. I am kinda grateful I had that view from my bed. If I hadn't, I would have walked out into the hallway, unaware of the horrors that awaited me. And my whole life would have changed, probably for the worst.

I woke up in the middle of the night, and was very thirsty. I wasn't afraid of anything so I immediately turned over to try to get out of bed. The moment I did, I thought I saw something white from the corner of my eye. I knew it didn't belong there. But it was there. The whole house was dark, and something white was out in the hallway. 

I was scared. Very scared, in fact. I will admit, my first thought was ""ghost!"". But then, I took a quick peek, and saw this long shape with what looked like a head, all in white. (fuck, here come the goosebumps!)

It was then that I allowed myself to actually be afraid. I looked away immediately, and then started to think of what to do next. I wanted to yell for my mom so bad, SO bad, but that thing was out there in the hallway, and my scream would either draw it to me, or it would make my mom see it from a close distance. I didn't want her to get hurt.

So I sat there, and I pinched myself, slapped myself, all while feeling very stupid, as if I was acting it out for an audience. I knew I was awake. I didnt' need those tests. But I did them. But at the time, I was proud of my bravery of the dark, and of my intelligence. I recognized the moment for what it was: a pivotal moment in my life. My chance to find out, once in for all, that ghosts don't exist. 

So I sat up, turned my head, and forced myself to stare...

And it was a lady.

It was a lady. She was there, facing the far wall opposite of me. I never doubted it. I could see her hair, and her dress, and her fucking slippers, which may I point out were pointing DOWNWARDS! *Fuck*. Her hair was long, down to the waist almost, and it curled upwards at the end, as if it was made up. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was the same colour, this pale white. Like an unpainted figurine, or a statue. Like a fucking statue. And she stood out SO badly. Like a glow in the dark object, she was a bright object in the middle of a pitch-black room, with NOTHING ELSE illuminated around her. she didn't cast off light! I don't get that!

As I sat there in the worst moment of my life, my mind burned every single fucking detail in my head, that way I can handily remember everything about her anytime I want to! Neat! She didnt move, or else I wouldn't be here. I panicked, I cried hot tears, and I covered myself fully, faced the wall, and went to sleep. 

The next morning, I woke up, checked the hallway, then ran down the stairs screaming for my mom. I don't think I ever recovered from that. Get me started on this topic, and I can seriously have a panic attack. I have before. I never even understood panic attacks until I tried to tell the tale to my friends in HS. We were at a sleep over, 4 of us total, and I found myself crying and panicking that the lady would get me then and there. It was unreasonable, but I had no control over it.

I was 12 or so, then. I was a child. But those images, those images are with me forever. The lady was there. And I was awake. I cannot change that, as much as I wish I could. 

And like I said, I am a skeptic. Still am. So when I got older, and moved away, and the years passed, I started to doubt it. I never doubted the fact that I saw what I saw but... I mean, I was 18 now, an atheist adult, so surely ghosts just *couldn't* exist, my memories notwithstanding. I just couldn't be sure of it, and it was driving me nuts. So at that age, I asked for reassurance. and oh boy did I get it. That tale is called **The Door**, and it will have to be saved for a further edit or another post. I also have to tell you about a confirmation of the lady's existence. Someone else saw her, years later. For now, this is all I have to give you.

Sorry about my long-windedness. It could be worse. I am still typing this in haste.

Feel free to ask me questions. Pardon any grammatical errors, I will try to proofread it shortly, and maybe add any information I may have left out. 

Until next time...

This one is pretty short and definitely not the most frightening experience I've had, but I actually had a dream about it last night which compelled me to share.

My boyfriend and I drove 8 hours down to SoCal for a wedding one weekend, we got a late start so we ended up checking into a random cheap motel close by to the wedding site around 1AM and headed straight for the bed. I was tired so I fell asleep right away, but around 5 I woke up to what I thought was my boyfriend getting up to use the bathroom only to find that he was dead asleep right next to me. I held onto him, eyes closed, afraid to look up but finally mustered the courage to after hearing whatever it was walk around our small room for a few minutes. Everything was exactly how we left it, doors bolted and locked, windows shut, lights off, etc except I could make out a strange shadowy figure pacing back and forth back and forth from the foot of our bed to the bathroom door, which was only about six feet away. It saw me staring at it and just stopped and stayed in one place, I think it was looking directly at me. I held onto my boyfriend and went under the covers, when I came up it was gone. The whole time I felt like it was not there to hurt us or cause us harm, but the atmosphere of the room turned kind of frantic, almost panicky in a way. I was definitely very scared.
The next morning we woke up and I let my boyfriend know what happened, he doesn't believe in ghosts and the paranormal so he didn't take me all too seriously. We got up from bed and finally got to get a good look at the hotel room, what we found was kind of eerie. Around the spot that I saw the figure pacing to and from was a weird, really huge, dark, brownish stain in the blue carpet, there were also smaller stains and splatters of this colored stain all over the carpet surrounding it as well as another larger stain next to the wall, you could tell someone spent a lot of time trying to clean the stains but they were too strong to come out. The wall was also a little off; there were weird patches of dark brown paint randomly painted over the white walls, always near the spots on the carpet. It was obvious someone's intentions were to cover something up. We had also noticed that at one point, the door had been kicked in then fixed and put back up in the doorway. Also, throughout our short stay we got about ten calls from guys asking if random girls were there.

Never did find out what happened in that room but it was kind of creepy. Our last day there we made up a story about how someone killed a hooker in the room and then police (or someone) broke down the door to find the hooker lying on the floor in a pool of blood. Not the scariest or best story out there...but it's 100% true!",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_ka9nk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ka9nk/weird_cheap_hotel_room/,
1374086556.0,32,self.Thetruthishere,1ii4k1,"I have always felt the Minnehaha falls were haunted, but now, I know. (real story, not for nosleep)",Forworkveiwing,46,14,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1ii4k1/i_have_always_felt_the_minnehaha_falls_were/,"So I have gone to the falls as a teen a lot. This place is not uncommon if you are from Minneapolis. A lot of people who see it during the day like to go and play in the river and walk down the paths and go down to the mississipi. Not many people, but yet some how a lot of people go down there at night. For many reasons. Graffiti, Smoking, Drinking. All sorts of reasons. It is a lot of fun down there! 

My favorite reason to go down there at night is to gaze at the stars! It is so pretty and besides the ford bridge having traffic, I would not know I was in the city. Much like how Fortsnelling feels during the day. But when I have gone down there in the past I would always feel something. The feeling was kind of harsh, but it wasnt alarming. 

Now in my family, the feeling and sight of the paranormal is not unusual. But as I get older, my feelings have been getting stronger. But because I am so used to these feelings I dont nope the hell out of anything too quick, cause though they are frightening, it is not anything to run out of a place too quick for. 

I was in a previous relationship where the guy didnt like to get out much at night, so I did not have a chance to go down to the falls for a long time, at night if at all. So I did not know I would feel this way when I went down there. 

My new boyfriend is down for anything! So we went down to the falls and we hung out by the actual falls for about 20 minutes at 10pm and all was okay. I knew someone was watching, he felt kind of lonely and sad, but friendly so I didnt mind it. 

We dicided it would be a good idea to walk down the the mississipi, cause I wanted my boyfriend to see the stars and how pretty it was, but I did not want to walk the way that I felt the lonely soul, so we went up the stairs to deer park and walked down to the river that way. Not a good idea. 

We went down there and deer park was sort of open, but it was not clear of ghosts. But I somehow knew that they were not paying any mind to us at all, so we went forward down to the river. I had no reason to turn back besides the feeling that I knew the spirits were at war with themselves. Which was odd, because usually they all look at me if I am in a place where I can sense them. But I digress. 

We walk down to the wooded path where we would walk to the river. Now this is where things get weird. I felt someone on the **other side** of the creek looking at us. but I am used to this because before, I would always feel this feeling of someone watching. But this time I felt the eyes had hatred and they were not very friendly. Not that they ever were, but this time it was more of a ""why are you trespassing on my land"" sort of thing. It was sort of harsh. But in spite of this, I still wanted my bf to have a good time and I didnt want him to know that I was scared so I continued on with our walk. 

There are three bridges we pass on the way to the river from where we were walking. Two on ground and one over head. We passed the first one on the ground, and about a minute after that is when my feelings started to worsen. But not only with the man over on the other side of the creek, but right in front of me. Which I have NEVER felt there in my life (but as I said before, as I get older, it is easier to tell these things). 

So as I was saying, it was about a minute after I pass the first bridge, that I see a man walking towards me. He knows I  can see him and he knows I can feel him. But he does not look at me. He just keeps walking past and doesnt look at me. This is the first time in my life that I have not seen a spirit in my mind, it is right in front of me. He is not aware that he is not alive, it seemed like. He just walks patrol, it feels like. but he was not happy. I couldnt get a clear feeling of what he was feeling but I know he was not happy. knowing this, I keep walking cause it was only one, and there was one on the other side. so as long as they were not near and did not want to bother me and my boyfriend, I was okay with that. The feeling just scared the living shit out of me. 

So as we keep walking, I see another spirit. The second was a little bit more frantic. It didnt scare me as much as the other two, though. which was werid, being that it seemed as though he was being chased. I did not see what was chasing him, but he was clearly running in fear for his life. I feel like this may have been how he died, being that he was running so fast and the look on his face was clear, but it was a shadow. I could almost hear his screams. But they werent screams. More like he was hollering. he wasnt saying anything. Just hollering. At this point I wanted to Nope the fuck out of there. But as I said before, I didnt want to frighten my Boyfriend, so I kept walking. 

The next time I see another ghost, we are past  the thrid bridge and almost to the river. This is the thrid one I have seen and This one Wasnt sure if I could see him, because I looked at him,but made it look like I could see right through him (that is what I normally do with spirits, as to not attract any attention to myself by them. I fear of being followed and that is not something I want.) I could tell he wanted to speak to me, but being that he wasnt sure if I could see him, he didnt say anything. (which is awesome, normally I can get all sorts of signals and sometimes questions that I have to ignore) But he wasnt firendly, but nor was he frightened. he was just there. Like he knew he was dead, but he didnt know how to get to the other side. I knew he looked right at me, and he was walking right in front of me, as I walked to the left and to the right as if trying to stop me as I got closer to him. This one was confusing me a little bit. I had no idea what to expect as I got closer and closer, but when he got close enough, I avoided the shadow and walked on with out looking back as if I never saw him at all. He felt disappointed as I passed in the realization that maybe I could not see him after all. 

So we get down to the river, and all is fine and I feel safer than I did before, but not quite out of the woods yet, metaphorically speaking, not literally. We get down there and it is dark and it was cloudy over the river, so I was disappointed, but i still wanted to have a good time, so I walk out of the wooded area and start to talk to my boyfriend about the river and how pretty it usually is at night and how I have been down there before and how the river was so high once, I couldnt walk down there. After I say this my boyfriend stops me and he points to the shore and tells me he thinks that people are down there and I saw no one. So I told him he was just seeing things and that they were rocks, not people. But he swears they are actually people. No, they arent. They are rocks. Which they were. Then he tellls me that he wants to get out of there and I persist on going down there cause I did not walk that way and pass three ghosts for nothing!!! I was scared. But I know spirits can not hurt me. They just frighten you. But then he says something, and it makes me think that he can feel the spirits, too. I take this chance to nope the fuck out of there at this point!! 

So we walk back, pass all three bridges with nothing happening but the spirit on the other side watching us and the spirit on before the second bridge doing his patrol thing. We get to deer park, and everything is has settled down from when we were last there about 40 minutes before. Just what felt like spirits sitting and looking. 

We get up the stairs and the rest of the night, where there are lights and we sat by a fountain, and talked for 20 to 30 minutes and then we left. He told me that he did not want me to bring him to a place where I did not feel safe again. But it wasnt that I didnt feel safe. These spirits terrified me. I explained to him what I saw as we went down there and what I felt. (he thought I meant that i felt there were people down there and that i was afraid we were gonna get mugged) Turns out, the entire way we walked down there he said he had goosebumps but he didnt want to say anything. He said that sometimes he can feel something in the room that isnt there, but he cant see anything. So this confirms that I am not crazy and that i wasnt just seeing things. This is by far the most frightened and not only that, but it is also the first time I have clearly seen anything physically in front of me. Usually they are just in my head, speaking to me and asking me things, or in my dreams. I have never felt this but it excites me, sort of. 

I have another interesting story to share that is real, I might add about a little girl in my house if anyone is interested in reading it!!! I can tell you a lot about her and what she is like!! Post in comments if you want to know other stories!! And feel free to ask me about other spirits I have felt or spoken to as well.

One day my mom and I were returning home from our trip to the beach. She was driving, I was sitting next to her, it was only the two of us.

We still had about two hours left on the road to finally reach my town. Our car was an old Volkswagen Beetle without air conditioning, so I used to have my window semi-open.

What happened was that we were on the road, and I heard a whistle sound next to me. At first I tried to rule it out as a mechanical failure, maybe something in my car had broken and what I was hearing was the sound of the wind against the car, but it sounded very natural, with pitch variations, as if someone was doing it. And it was right next to me. My mom heard it too.

It wasn't coming from another car, since we had no cars next to us except for the ocassional drivers that would pass us and be gone in seconds. (She was driving rather slowly, but it was still a semi-normal speed).

The whistling lasted for a few minutes and she got scared because we couldn't find any explanation for it. I closed my window and it was still there, outside the car and next to me.

Suddenly it was gone and I was relieved. But not for long... about 5 minutes passed and I heard it again.

It finally stopped when we were almost reaching our town.

In half an hour we were finally home. We got inside the house, I turned on the computer as usual and checked my e-mail, or googled something, I don't remember exactly. I heard the whistling sound once again, outside my window.

In other circumstances I would have thought it was one of my neighbours, but it sounded just like the one I heard moments ago, while we were on the road.

I noped the hell out of there and that was the end of it. Never heard it again.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1hdw9a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1hdw9a/a_whistling_followed_me_home/,

This will be one story for now, but I will add more later when I have time to sit down and write it all out.

When I was about 11 years old, I was just getting adjusted to the house that I have moved into just the year before. It's an old house that creaks and settles at night, so, after the reassurance of my father and mother, I let that go; however, one night confused me the most. 

I was on my desktop computer as I was playing around on AOL. It was night at around 8 o'clock. I was listening to my CD player as I was chatting with friends from my previous school and out-of-state friends. As a song ended from the CD, it sounded like static started out of the blue. I listen to CDs frequently in a row, and the static was incredibly out of place since I knew it wasn't meant to do that. I had the CD for a couple of days as well and it didn't have scratches on it.

As I looked at the player, a deep, garbled voice came through the static and said my name. I blinked and searched for my dad to be somewhere in the room. I was alone upstairs and my dad was downstairs. I panicked after realizing that fact and shut off my player and got off the computer. I went around the house to clear my head and to double check there wasn't anyone with me upstairs with me that I just didn't notice. Nothing.

1367871040.0,31,self.Thetruthishere,1dta27,Has anyone else experienced this?,FlannelledHam,42,11,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1dta27/has_anyone_else_experienced_this/,"Hello reddit! This is my first post so ill do my utmost to be concise.

Just to put you in my frame of mind, i don't believe in ghosts or anything paranormal and think there is probably rational scientific explanations for strange goings on. So to my story and question.

From the ages 3 to 14 i lived in a 2 bedroom flat/apartment with my mum and little brother (6 years my junior). My front door led directly into the hall, the bathroom was the first door on the left and the kitchen the second door on the left wall, the living room was parallel to the front door at the end of the hall and the bedrooms off to the right side of the flat. 

Now for as long as i can remember into my childhood i would walk through my hall in the direction of the lounge/bedrooms, and every single time without fail when i approached the kitchen door (for lack of a better word) a ""figure"" would protrude from the kitchen door frame and then return to its own realm ;p

Now this ""figure"" was completely black, pretty much a shadow, was the height of a 6 year old or so and would appear when i crossed the exact same spot and disappear as soon as it had arrived. It was only the head, neck and left shoulder (from its perspective) of the child shadow that would pop out and disappear.
So this happened to me all my childhood and it wasn't until about 10-11 years old i started getting scientific with my little friend. I was trying all manner of lighting and door arrangements, walking speed etc. I was pretty convinced and still am that it was some sort of condition with my peripheral vision. But no surprise, the only thing that affected my friends return would be looking directly at his ""home"" on the kitchen door frame or removing all light sources in or to the hall (dont know if this worked i just couldnt fucking see).

Typing this i realise it sounds pretty stupid/weird and maybe should be scary for a kid my age at the time, but i must stress i grew up with this and never felt threatened by it...it seemed more mischievous than anything else, like it was playing hide and seek or something and it was probably just some odd ocular reactive mechanism anyway. 

Years go by, hit puberty, get tall and still it happens. Which kinda discounts eye levels and that sort of shit. For some reason i never ever told anyone about it, partly because it was as normal to me as taking a piss and partly because it, well, sounds stupid.
 Around about 13-14 my mum gets a new bloke and he has two kids. A daughter my age and a boy my brothers age. One day for some reason i brought up my peripheral vision abnormalities with the daughter(who has been in the house countless times) and she says something like ""fuck i see that too but was to embarrassed to say yadayada "" 
I find this very peculiar so decide to dawn my detectives hat and for the first time in my life i ask my brother ( 7 years old ) if he sees this thing. Nonchalantly he is like ""yeah i see that, and?"" He has been seeing it all his life too. I now ask my mums boyfriends son ( 7 years old ) and he doesn't see it and either do my mum or her boyfriend. 

Moved out of that flat about a year later and am now 27 hoping to begin studying for a PhD in the coming years. It was procrastinating on this sub reddit that brought these memories back and i thought id share it with you guys as i cant for the life of me come to a logical explanation about it. Most likely its something to do with the eyes and the shape of the area causing some black spot in the form of a small child appear in your periphery lol fuck knows. Just weird that my mum never saw it and i was her height when i was 14, so again got to discount it being something to do with height. Mums boyfriends son never saw it although he was the same age and height as my brother, who did. 

Was speaking to my brother about it yesterday before i posted this for some clarification and he also told me he used to see the same thing in one of the doors in my grans house. I never experienced it there.  

Sorry for the massive block of text but i just want to ask if anyone else has had the same specific thing happen to them or something similar or an answer of what it could be?

1367030127.0,30,self.Thetruthishere,1d71qw,Handful of scary shit [ME],tonyfromtexas,43,13,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1d71qw/handful_of_scary_shit_me/,"Ok folks, I have a handful of stories that I have experienced. I'll tell them in the order that they occured.

Story 1
Some back information. I lived in a neighborhood that consists of one street and three houses. We lived in the middle house. To the right of us there was a family of five; father, mother, two daughters, and one disturbed son. To the left of us lived a family of 3; mother, father, and a disturbed son. We had come back from vacations the day after this little shit storm occured. The night before we came back the distubed sons from the house on the right and left went off to the house on the left and murdered the father and mother; they then took off to go kill one of the sons grandfather but they commited suicide on the way over. Ok so new family moves in; a mother, father, and a their young son.

Ok, so after a while of living there we became friends with the new family. One night they had asked us to babysit their kid for the night because they wanted to go to some costume party or something. So the kid is with us having a blast but it quickly turns sour. He starts to cry and wants to go back home. So my sister and I take him over. His parents havnt left yet and they answer. My sister explains to them whats going on and when she was doing that I was looking passed them into the house. Thats when I saw the disturbed son that lived there before who commited the murders and then offed himself pass through; from the living room into the kitchen. As he passes by he looks right over at me. I had asked the young kid, that lived there now, a few weeks later who was at the house that night. He told me that it was only his parents and himself. I cant recall how I was able to attain a picture of the disturbed son but when I did, well yeah, sure enough, it was him.


This is another story that has the same kid but its unrelated. One day we were playing at his house and he asked us if we wanted any caprisuns. You dont turn down caprisun. So he goes and gets them. He starts to take long to return so my bro and I are like wtf? We go over to the kitchen and find him in the fedal position rocking back and forth. We ask him what the fuck he is doing and he just says ""oh, I just do that sometimes"". Oh and the fucking kitchen lights were off.

Ok enough about neighborhood haunted as fuck. Time to move on to Mexico. 

Story number two. One time in Mexico I was staying at my cousins house. So night time comes and we are going to bed. I get to sleep on the floor. Before we head off to sleep my cousins decides to tell us about his grandfather that had died in that house. AND that sometimes he still hears his grandfather calling for him. OK thanks cuz, going to sleep now, fucker. In my cousins room there is a huge ass window that looks down into the living room which is connected to the kitchen; my cousin told me that he would hear his grandfather calling to him from the kitchen through that window. Guess who is sleeping on the floor right in front of that fucking window, yup, yo' boy. So they fall asleep super fast and I'm trying to go to sleep. Nervouse as fuck. I remember drifting into sleep but then being wide the fuck awake because it felt like someone was staring at me. As if someone was standing right in front of the window looking down at me as I was sleeping or trying to sleep. I couldnt move, I mean I could move but I didnt fucking want to. I was paralyzed with fear for about 20 minutes until I got enough courage to stand up and pull the light switch that was right above where I was sleeping. The moment I put any effort to lift myself off the floor the dogs (who are somtimes kept on the owners roof in Mexico) that were chilling on the roof right above me came running to the exact spot I was at and started to bark like crazy and scratch the floor crazy style. I laid right the fuck back down and didnt move for another 35-40 minutes, not a god damn muscle. After many many many prayers I summed up enough courage to stand up and pull that light switch again. I pull that mother fucker and that mother fucker does not turn on. Im instantly in my cousins bed shaking the shit out of him so he would wake up. The whole time I'm covering my eyes so I dont look towards the window. He finally wakes up and turns on the light; he is too sleepy to stay awake and fell back into sleep. I was fine by then; you know the light conquers all and shit. End story.

Story number three. I'm proud of myself for this one. So my older brother bought a house and me and my younger brother moved in to help pay for it. About 3 months in this crazy shit occured but let me explain my theory on why it occured. My older brother and my sister in law (his wife) were constant argueing for about 2 weeks straight before this happened. I'm pretty sure that negativity is what had attracted this thing in the first place. I'm saying this because the house was brand new; we were the first to live there.

Ok, so I also work with my brothers. Family business; has its ups and downs. Anyways, one day we were working the same shift and I decided to leave a little early. I got home and just sat down on the couch in the living room and planned on waiting on my bros to come home to do shit and what not. Behind where I'm sitting we keep our dog in her cage at night. So I'm chilling and that dog starts barking all crazy style glaring at the middle of the living room, barking her ass off. I tell her to chill out and she just looks at me for a second and then right back to the middle of the living room barking her ass off. I think to myself ""oh hell mothafuckin no; we just moved in this motherfucker"" and stand up and walk to the middle of the living room. I stand there and put my palms outwards and say ""listen, I dont know what you are or what you want but here you will only find love; if you want love and love only you are more than welcomed to stay, but if you want anything else you must leave"" and at that very moment that I finished  saying that the dog stopped barking and laid down all chilled out. That was that.

Story number four. I was running the shift one night at the plant with my younger brother. My dad had finished his shift a few hours earlier and went home; or so I thought. I'm standing in front of my bay looking in at everyone set up the line for production. I look down the factory towards the loading area and I see my dad leaning against a guard rail. I didnt have my contacts on that day so it was pretty blurry but I could make out my dad's figure; brown baseball low profile cap on, yellow plaid tucked into some fitted jeans and brown sneakers. He also had his arms crossed exactly like my dad would be chilling; giving me the impression that it was my dad. So I yell down the factory telling him to go home and that what was he still doing here. He keeps his posture and keeps looking my way. I'm thinking he is just being a hardass so I get a little fustrated. I start insulting my dad playfully, ""Come on old man your fuses are gonna bust go home... go home workaholic!... dad, what the fuck are you doing here?!"", the last insult sent my ""dad"" into a chuckle. I could make out a smile and his shoulders boucing from chuckling. I turn to look for my brother inside the bay and I call him out asking him if he knows why dad is still here. Took like 2 seconds to ask him and turn my head back. Mother fucking ghost was gone. I immediatly call my dad and ask him where he is at. He says home and is a little annoyed because I keep asking him if he was just here. Finally he makes it really clear that he had left hours ago and that he thinks I'm on drugs. So I hang up and that was that.

Also, I have a handful of employees with stories; boxes moving on their own, someone using metal with chains, a frantic woman scream, a boy laughing, and tell me they see shit out of the corner of thier eyes; I believe them because I to have been fucked with here. One time I was walking back towards my bay to go do some prestine managing; I was looking down at my phone while walking and I saw from the corner of my eye and heard someone walking up on me really quickly. I look up and turn my head and the damn ghost plays a ""cant see me because Im moving with you"" game and kinda shuffles behind my back until I fully turn all the way around and the ghost is gone. Seems like a playful ghost to me.

Ok, last one, story number five. This happened to be a little over a year ago. I can toss this one up to sleep paralysis but I dont know it was super fucking real. 

My baby was 2 weeks old when this happened. I woke up to my baby crying and it sounded like someone was walking down this long hallway with her. She kept getting father away and I could hear the footsteps getting more and more distant. So in a fit of anger I scream out ""GIVE ME MY BABY BACK!"" but my mouth would not open for shit and all that came out was ""MMM M MMM MM MMM!!"". This angered me even more so I attempted to spring out of bed; nope, cant fucking move at all and the more I try the more this thing that is taking my baby away is amused. That mother fucker was laughing as he walked away with her and the more angry I got the more menacing and loud his laugh would get. In desperation I scream out ""FUCK YOU"" and my left arm breaks free from paralysis and Im back into the room. I look over and see my baby safe in her crib and I start crying hard enough to wake up my ex and she is asking me what is wrong but she is so exhausted that she drifts off to sleep as I try to explain to her. 

So these are my stories. Hope you enjoyed.

THIS POST IS VERY LONG sorry about that.

I have always been the kid too into horror movies and thrillers, hide and seek in the dark an just in general trying to scare the shit out of myself, I've never watched a movie that has truly scared me, not much else ever has. After the following occurrences I don't think ill ever be as scared as I was during the time of this ordeal.

One day whilst at home with my girlfriend we decided to make a ouija board, we crafted it out of thick cardboard and used a small glass(similar size to a shot glass with a thing base). At first it was a bit of a laugh as everyone's first time, and we both became serious after the glass ha moved on what appeared to be its own merit; we both went silent. 

Incase some of you didn't know you aren't meant to ask spirit intimate questions about its death(how did you die? What was it like? Etc), well we did.. Big mistake, the glass was vibrating and became hard to keep under the one knee at times, eventually it was forced of the board as if someone just pulled it out from under fingers. We both looked at each other in disbelief, I wanted to tell her to stop joking around but I knew and wasn't get and same for her to me.

We decided we'd give it another go an try to contact the last spirit we had been in touch with to apologize, upon asking if there were any spirit present the glass started vibrating, almost lifting off the table; the light in the room slowly dimmed until it was dark. The light slowly flickered back on, we asked for the spirits age, 46, after this we asked for its name it slowly spelt out the full name of my girlfriends family friend nick, I felt this calm warm feeling inside me; adversely my girlfriend felt terror and much to my dismay flipped the board without putting the glass to ""goodbye"". She immediately ran into my room and started crying her eyes out, I didn't want to but I expressed the importance of putting the glass I ""goodbye"" and how of you don't the ouija board doesn't fully end.. We never went back to say goodbye.

Night 1
That night I went to bed as usual, my door hand no pin in the handle or locks, I use two 8kg weight to keep it from opening and closing in the breeze at night, the next morning the weights were by the side of my bed on the opposite Side of my room to the door.  I asked my my if he'd moved them, she hadn't.

Night 2
The same thing happened again. Exactly the same placement.

Night 3 
I went to bed as usual and in the morning when I woke up, the two weights I use to keep my door closed were moved up onto my bedside table. I really started to get worried I asked everyone that was in my house if they'd moved then, all negative responses. 

Night 4 
I was lying in bed around 2am, my door slowly creeped open and then closed (Before I went to bed I made sure all the windows in my room were closed same as the ones in my hallway which could allowed wind to blow my door open). Then I felt a rush of cold through my body and felt something lay down next to me, I heard the bed creek, I felt the sheets move. It then got up and a few seconds after my door once again opened and closed. The next morning my weights were in the hallway outside my door this freaked me out more than I have ever been in my life.

Night 5
I slept in my little sisters room on her bottom bunks and all night it was as if she was speaking in tongues, I don't believe in god but I was praying all night and got literally no sleep, the next the day I called a friends uncle who had dealt with this type of stuff before.

He came into my house and was immediately shocked at the spiritual state of my lounge room, he did some spiritual cleansing exercises, after about 3 days of this all the activity stopped I burned the ouija board and I have never played again, if anybody is thinking of the playing the ouija board think of the negatives, it's not just a bit of fun, most people you speak to that have played will tell you it was a mistake.

1365579746.0,34,self.Thetruthishere,1c1tzb,Heard three mystery sounds while home alone,lo_la,44,10,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1c1tzb/heard_three_mystery_sounds_while_home_alone/,"Hi, first post here, hoping I follow all the rules correctly.  New account because I have had a number of odd experiences, and if this goes well (I hope it does) I would like to share more without having it in my other account's history.

Okay, this happened when I was 25 and was home visiting my parents for a few weeks.  Background:

**First**, I'm an atheist and I was an atheist at the time, and none of my weird experiences have caused me to re-believe in an anthropomorphic god.  I do, however, think consciousness might be separate from matter, and that we as a species understand very, very little as yet about all the energies in existence and the nature of consciousness.  

I grew up in a religious, uptight household, and my parents wouldn't let me watch rated R movies, so I never saw a single horror movie (worth watching - I think we watched the PG-rated ""It's Alive"" from 1974 when I was 10 or so) until I was in my teens.  The dogma surrounding this was that Satan was trying to let himself in via entertainment (sigh I hate even repeating this idiocy).  In adulthood I made it clear I was going to live life on my own terms, so in visiting my parents at 25, I watched what I wanted as long as they weren't home.

**Second**, this house we lived in was probably built around 1890 even though county records didn't show it being constructed until 1920 or something.  When we did repairs, we found newspaper from 1890 lining walls.  

The people who lived there before us were a crazy elderly couple who then moved into assisted living, and the man had jars of his piss sitting around the house when we bought it in 1991. It was claimed the woman had seen her daughter killed in a car accident from her front window in 1936 or so and had been mentally off since. I don't know if this stuff is true.  I will say that the weirdness and badness of the house yielded nothing remotely paranormal until my weird encounter, to my disappointment while growing up.

**Third**, I had numerous (not too significant) unexplainable things happen to me from childhood onward, maybe one or two per year, and it tapered off when I was 19.  The frequency of these occurrences - and, for the most part, the non-scariness of them - had led me to have a practical and almost dismissive approach to the unexplained.  Okay, so unexplained things happen sometimes, never when I expect, and never what I want (like a full-on Brown Lady), whoopeedoo.

So even though it had been a few years since an encounter like this was 'normal,' I still had the same practical approach when it happened.  

--------------------------

Having missed out on many movie experiences children of the 80s grew up with, I was slowly catching up. This evening was pitch-black with no moon and my parents were out for the evening, so I was watching *Nightmare on Elm Street* for the first time ever alone in the dark.  I shut off all the lights in an effort to make it more effective, but it didn't work.  Like many horror movies that would've probably been much more effective on me in childhood, I was mostly bored, though impressed with the creativity of the special effects.  

My parents lived in a rural area, and the only sound that could ever be heard was maybe a faint dog barking from a quarter mile away, or vehicles driving by on the road that ran by the house, or maybe someone pulling into the gravel driveway from the crunching of the gravel under their tires.

So as I sat there bored, right in the middle of the movie I heard a succession of three noises that were most certainly not made by a person or people.  

The first was off to my left, 5-7 feet away.  I heard a crisp, rustling swish-swish-swish sound, the sound a stiff, old-fashioned ladies' dress makes when the lady is walking in it at a normal pace.  

I knew nobody was there.  I didn't turn and look - because if it was a ghost, I didn't want them to know I heard them, to increase the chance they wouldn't mess with me (yes, that was really my thought). I knew immediately several things:  one, that my mind was not playing tricks on me.  The sound was very clear, and close.  Two, that I was scared, sure, but I also felt no ill intent from the source of this sound.  Three, that this most certainly did not come from anything that could've possibly been in the location it was coming from (which was my brother's bedroom doorway leading into the TV room).

The second noise was a little further away, sounding like it came from inside the kitchen, also off to my left, but about 8-10 feet away.  It was a heavy clomp-clomp-clomp of a man wearing boots.  Heavy, old-fashioned super-tough boots.  My dad is a working man and has always worn work boots, but his are made of modern materials and have rubber bottoms, and they sound a little less heavy.

The clomp-clomp-clomp of the boots was again a normal gait, no deliberate stomping, running, or anger.  This time, for an absurd moment, I wondered if my dad was somehow there.  I realized an instant later that of course he wasn't (we all came and went via the super-squeaky back door, the floors squeaked, and he would've been heard long, long before that point) and, again, I didn't look.  I was sitting still staring straight forward at the movie in absolute terror.  (And absolutely nothing on the screen was terrifying to me, or even sort of scary.)

Then the final sound.  A rapping on the back window, tap-tap-tap.  Unlike the other two, this was quick, but still audibly clear as a bell.  Taptaptap, like someone would when coming by for afternoon tea.  This one was about 20 feet away.  As with the second sound, for a brief moment I thought it might be a neighbor or someone we knew knocking on that window.  Then that thought fled again, because it was pitch-dark outside and nobody would  knock on that window even if it was light.

I sat perfectly still staring straight ahead at the movie, all the way until it ended.  I was scared, sure, as scared as anyone is of the unknown, but I felt no ill will, bad vibes, or any other different feeling like cold or hair raised or thick air.  I stared straight ahead acting indifferent until the movie was completely over, and it had been some time since anything happened.  The entire encounter had taken place within forty seconds, with a lengthier pause between the boots and the knocking than between the swish and the boots.

I went to bed that night unafraid. I wondered briefly, because of my religious upbringing plus my surface-skimming study of various types of spiritual concepts, that some sort of spirits had been drawn out because I was watching a horror movie and, like, vibes or something.  But the conclusion I eventually came to was that watching the movie itself put my mind in a state where it was able to hear those noises, and things of that type were probably always present.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1c1tzb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1c1tzb/heard_three_mystery_sounds_while_home_alone/,

Over the past few days I've been sharing all of the ""ghost"" stories that I have heard from trusted family members.  Today, I figured I'd share the most recent (although it's been about 9 years, now) ghost story that happened directly to me.

When I was a freshman in college, I moved into an all-girls' dorm.  For almost the entire year, I never experienced anything out of the ordinary.  There was a girl on the floor who claimed that there was a ghost in her room (lights switching on and off, blinds opening and closing, etc.), but we never really paid much attention to her claims (which I'm sure she didn't appreciate too much).

That all changed one night when I went down into the basement to do my laundry.  I took the elevator down, threw my laundry in the machine, and then walked back to the elevator with my empty laundry basket.  As the elevator door was closing, I looked out into the hallway.  Underneath the stairwell I saw this little (3 feet tall?) shimmery, sparkly looking shape.  It looked like TV static.  This was right as the doors were closing.  I've never had a longer elevator ride, even though I was only going up four floors.  Of course, in a panic, I told my roommate what I had seen, but she thought I was totally nuts.  This was at the very end of the school year, so I kind of forgot about it over the summer.

The next year, the dorm was converted from girls-only to co-ed.  I'm not sure if this triggered the activity or not, but that's always been my theory.  A group of boys moved in next door to me (one of them ended up as my husband... awww).  Almost immediately, my future-hubs (I'll call him ""Hubs"" from here on out) started having some really bizarre experiences.

The third night that he lived in the room, Hubs woke up in the middle of the night to see a girl standing in the middle of his room.  He actually thought it was me sleepwalking.  Since he didn't know me well yet, he didn't want to embarrass me by telling me that I'd been sleepwalking, so he asked our friend Dan what to do.  Dan told him that he should lock his door so that ""I"" wouldn't come into his room again.  Lo and behold, after locking his door that night, ""I"" was standing in his room... again.  Of course, this really shook him up, and he ended up telling us about it.

Soon afterwards, there was a night that he woke up to hear cups moving around on the other side of his room.  In his college stupor he figured that his friends were playing beer pong, but a few seconds later, he realized that his roommates were gone for the weekend.  He spun around in his bed so he could see what was going on, and he saw the same girl AND a LITTLE SHORT GUY!  At this point, he had never heard my story about the shiny, sparkly thing in the basement, but since it was short-statured, I think it was the same thing.

The activity really picked up from there.  One night, my friends and I were watching a movie.  We were facing our door, which was open to the hallway.  Three of us saw a tall, skinny shadow (I describe it as a person with Abraham Lincoln's build) take one giant step past the door.  Another similar experience my roommate had was while she was putting on her makeup to go out one night, she saw a black flash dart across the mirror in front of her.  There were other times when something really loud would run down the hallway and pound on everyone's doors when there was no one in the hall.

One afternoon, I was in my room skipping class because I had the flu.  I was lying on my futon with my head against the wall that divided my room from Hubs' room.  All of a sudden, it sounded like someone had broken into his room and was trashing all of his stuff.  It sounded like someone was breaking EVERYTHING and throwing all of his electronics on the floor.  It came to an end when I heard something that sounded like a huge bucket of marbles being dumped on the floor.  I called him and told him what I heard, but when he got home from class, nothing was out of place at all.

Towards the end of the school year, Hubs was studying for his finals when I heard him yell, ""GET THE F*** OUT!""  I heard him throwing something, and by the time I jumped out of my chair to see what was going on, he was already in the hallway.  I asked him what had happened and apparently he looked up from studying and saw that the blanket that he and his roommates put up to divide the room for privacy was kind of moving.  He looked again and saw what looked like a finger tracing or pointing on the other side of the blanket making big sweeping gestures.  The window was closed, which even if it wasn't, it wouldn't matter because it didn't look like a blanket blowing in the breeze.  It had a distinct motion to it and there was a clear pointy finger or something that was behind the blanket.

The next year I decided to live off-campus, but Hubs stayed in that dorm.  I got a call in the middle of the night from him that was basically demanding that I go pick him up.  It was the middle of the winter in New England, but when I drove up about 15 minutes later, Hubs was waiting outside without a coat or anything and jumped in my car.  I asked what was going on and he said he was up late watching the Red Sox play in Japan (it was about 3 am, I think) when his door shot open.  

I think there were even more stories, but those are the ones I can remember right now.  The only sinister thing that I know happened in the dorm occurred a few years before I moved in.  A girl had a baby in the bathtub but was in denial that she was ever pregnant and ended up throwing the baby in the dumpster on our floor.  I think the janitor found the baby.  It was a really sad story and pretty disturbing to find out that that had happened where we lived.  I don't see how that matches with any of our experiences, though.

So he was a trucker doing a run through rural Lancashire and stopped in a layby (a paved area of a road where cars/trucks can stop for a break) and he was having a nap. Now its about 4am in the morning and there is fuck all about when he hears like a rumbling, the kind you hear when a train goes by in the distance. He said he felt a pressure building which he says is what made him properly wake up, he looked at his watch which he noticed had stopped, he thought probably the battery was done in (even though he had it replaced a couple of weeks prior) so he goes to check his phone, which is dead and won't turn on. He notices as well that none of the electrics in his cabin are working nor will his truck start. The pressure starts getting what he could only describe as heavier and he notices the hair on his body is standing on end. This is all only a minute after he heard that noise, now he said he looked down the dual carriageway (out of his windscreen) which was lit by street lights and then looked in his wing mirror up the road and saw the street lights all going off one after the other coming towards him. He said something shot over the top of the truck and down the carriageway over the lights that were going off in its wake. Now he was really creeped out by this because other than that faint rumbling it was too silent for how close it felt, he had to wait for ages too before his electronics started working again. 

He's since dismissed it as some sort of military aircraft because it happened near where I live which is near I think a BAE/UK Military testing base. I'm tempted to agree with him since we've had several strange occurrences happen which were later explained by the base to be experiments conducted by them, one in particular caused pants to be shat because the experiment produced white flashes across the sky like lightning but completely silent. Reminiscent of the war of the worlds Tom Cruise film, but this was apparently them doing some sort of atmospheric testing. I've also seen formations of lights in the sky around our area once when I was driving with my mum who also saw them which meant I wasn't crazy or high.

Essentially, I often seem to have ""flash-forwards"" or ""visions"". Generally every 1-2 weeks but sometimes more, sometimes less, and have done for as long as I can remember - I'm 16 now, and I can distinctly remember these things happening from about the age of 4. I'm normally just day-dreaming in class or lying in my bed thinking about random stuff and then I see a random scene (no longer than 30 seconds) that is normally rather mundane, but I know I have never encountered before, and then, within 6 weeks (normally closer to 3-4 weeks), that *exact* same scene happens. It's generally stuff like a snippet of a lesson or a conversation at lunch, nothing too exciting (although I have had ones where I've ""seen"" parts of exams, and so I decided to just make sure I can answer those questions, and they come up) but it is quite extraordinary to me.

I'm not one to particularly believe in the supernatural but this has happened frequently enough and for long enough that I can't ignore it.

I used to just pass it off as de ja vu, I mean, I must just be tricking myself that I have seen and heard these exact words before right? But it's happened so many times now, I'm positive it's not just de ja vu, and I really cannot for the life of me explain it any other way.

So, yeah...that's my story, for now. 

Edit: Thinking about it, they have become less frequent over time and I haven't had one in 2013 as of yet. As people have suggested I will attempt to document it as and when.",,False,,t5_2sntx,1359066704.0,,,True,t3_177fc9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/177fc9/i_feel_like_i_have_some_kind_of_uncontrollable/,

The house was built in the 80's, and was remodeled once before we bought it, I believe. The people who owned it before us had a mentally challenged daughter who died as an adult at some point. Not really sure when. Not even sure if it's relevant to what I and my family have seen. 

The house is two stories, and the second floor has a kind of balcony that looks down into the living room of the first floor. The stairs come up facing that balcony. My mom's bedroom is on the left side of the balcony, and on the right is a door that we converted to a window because it led to an unfinished balcony outside. My bedroom and my sisters bedrooms are on the other side of the second floor. 

Often over the years, when my mom was downstairs reading in the living room, she would see a girl go from her bedroom upstairs, along the balcony, and go through the window/door to outside and disappear. It would always be during the day, and she described her as a younger girl, maybe 10-12, white dress/nightgown and long dark hair. 

I never saw the girl go along the balcony, but one evening, I was probably 16 at this point, as I was getting ready for bed, I walked up the stairs and as I rounded the corner to get to my bedroom, I saw a girl in a white nightgown walk into my room fairly quickly. I thought it was my younger sister, trying to hide in my room to scare me as she often did. I thought to myself ""nice try, I totally caught you!"" and entered my room. I checked the usual places my sister would hide; around my bed, in my closet, nothing. I searched all over my room, no one was in there. There was no way my sister could have sneaked out of my room without me noticing. I found out later she wasn't even upstairs at all. 

None of this ""activity"" bothered or scared any of us, because we never felt threatened at any time. This girl was just our resident spirit, and really didn't do anything too creepy other than walk around.

YEARS later, all us kids were grown up and moved out, my mom had since passed away. We were all over at the house for dinner with my dad, and we had all brought our SO's along with us. We were all sitting at the dinner table, getting ready to eat, just waiting for my sisters boyfriend to come down the stairs. When he got to the dinner table, he had a weird look on his face, but didn't say anything. 

Later, he told us that as he was walking down the stairs to the dining room, he saw a girl/woman (he really wasn't paying much attention to the person) coming up the stairs at the same time. He assumed it was my brother's girlfriend, and stepped to the side to allow her to pass. As he got to the table, however, he found my brother's girlfriend was already at the table waiting with the rest of us. 

He isn't sure who he saw, as he wasn't really paying attention to the female coming up the stairs. He claimed he didn't really even make eye-contact, obviously not expecting any strangers to be in the house. He has met my mom, but couldn't be sure if it was her he saw coming up the stairs. 
Only my dad lives in the house now, and he hasn't really experienced anything, and never saw the young girl that the rest of us did.

Experiences with ouija boards part 2.,,41,11,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/11enjm/request_from_usammichmaker_experiences_with_ouija/,"It seems that you all enjoyed Laura's experiences and I hope that some of you heeded warnings on why they shouldn't be used. Yet again I'll begin by warning you of two things. 1 please don't use them. 2. Excuse spelling errors, I'm on my fancy new ipad and am not very tech savvy with it just yet. So many apologies for that.

Last nights experiences were the only ones Laura was willing to tell me, she has many more however she isn't one who likes talking about it.

Tonight I will share two personal experiences of ouija board use. I apologise for how long this post is. If you read all the way to the bottom, you are awesome.

My mother passed away when i was 5 and things havent been so good since. most of my childhood i spent wondering what it would be like if mum was still alive, and generaly filled with a longing to speak with her again. during my early teenage years, i learned about ouija boards, but not the dangers. i thought to myself, "" maybe i can contact mum!"" obviously with ouija boards this is not the case. its an open portal to anything that wants to chat. The first time I was around 14. I had a friend, a best friend during high school called renee, do this board session with me. We were home alone after school when we decided to do it. Things were going fairly standard at first. Standard questions dumb teenage girls ask when they're excited and think they're being cool. I decided to talk the plunge with this entity on the other side and ask if it knew my mum. ""Yes""... ""Can you ask her to talk to me? I can give you my cell number to pass on to her if you like? Hahaha"". Idiotic.

What ever it was on the other side just kept pointing to ""yes"" more and more feverently, even when we didn't ask it questions. I told renee that this was bullshit and we should stop, obviously the spirit was ""spacky and retarded"". We took our fingers off the pointer and went to leave when the pointer shot over toward ""yes"" and then flew at me and fell to the floor. Renee and me kinda froze WTFing all over the place. As we were still seated and had our arms on the table, the fucking table began to shake. We both shot up away from the table, and the bloody thing still shook like an earth quake. I had heard that if you apologise to the spirit profusely, it will go away. So I did, very quickly. We decided to leave the house, and the still shaking table. We then both cleared the board off the table (which was still shaking when we left), ran outside, threw it in some bushes down the road and came back home a few hours later.

To be honest, I consider myself lucky that a shaky table was all that happened. I have spoken about this experience to others and they all think that it was a dark entity that wasn't my mother. And that me and renee were absolute dickheads, i'll happily agree with that. Calling a spirit names isn't such a great idea.

My second experience was with my friend Laura and her youngest daughter Emily and is an experience that happened a year ago when I was living with laura and her family.

Emily was at the time 13. She had been brought up knowing about her mothers talents and in a way was quite gifted herself. Although had trouble controlling her talents unlike Laura. Emily was more susceptible to negative energies rather than positive ones. Lots of weird shit has happened to Emily through her life. But she has her mother to guide and protect her.

Anyway, Emily is a good kid. Makes the same mistakes all teenagers do, but has a huge heart and I consider her like a little sister. She is the kind of kid who will always try and help you, always bubbly and chatty. Awesome young woman and very much like her mum in ways.

Emily had been warned through out her life that ouija boards, seances and dark stuff was forbidden in the house and forbidden to do due to the dangers they imposed. Laura was very clear on why these things were dangerous, never skipped the details to young Emily. Emily agreed and knew better than to participate in the sort of thing.

As all teenagers do, Emily had some stupid friends. Stupid friends with stupid ideas. 

They all decide to do an ouija board at Kim's house. Laura and myself didnt know this at the time. Emily's friend Kim, wasn't exactly normal. Bit of a messed up kid from a messed up background. Something never sat right with me whenever I met Kim and I'd always feel uncomfortable around her. Just a weird presence about the girl I could never put my finger on why. Laura agreed with me but we decided not to intervene as Emily has to make her own choice of friends.

Emily comes home from kims house, very grumpy and moody. I assumed it was hormones and having a bad day. Possibly an argument between her and her girlfriends at Kim's. I leave her alone for a bit to cool off. Teenage girls break up and make up all the time, no biggie.

Laura asks em what's wrong after half an hour or so, em responds with "" none of your fucking business you bitch!"". Laura and me both stood there gob smacked. Emily, usually polite and full of love and respect for her mum, just swore at her. An argument ensued between Laura and Emily. Emily, normally mortified to even swear, let alone treat her mother like that, didn't care and stormed off to her room swearing all the way. 

Laura and myself were pretty shocked. We sat in the couch for a bit and Laura said she would talk to Emily properly after the dust had settled. We both knew something was up with Emily and it must be a rather big deal for her to act the way she was. 

Before Laura could go and talk to Emily again, Emily came out into the living room in tears. "" mum I have these bruises all over me and I don't know how"". Laura immediately went over to her to check her out, only to find handprint sized bruising all over her neck, chest, arms and back. Like some one had grabbed her really hard or tried to strangle her. Laura demands to know who did this to her, and Emily claims she doesn't know. Laura asks what happened over at Kim's house. 

"" mum, I'm sorry, we decided to do an ouija board. Kim said it would be a laugh.""

Laura by this point is panicking. She tells Emily to run herself a bath and cleanse herself in some Epsom salts for a while.
Emily grumpily pushed her mother out of the way and told her to ""fuck yourself"".

Laura asked me to run Emily the bath and put the whole box of Epsom salts in with it. So I did, whilst WTFing at the situation. I told em the bath was ready and she went and had a bath, not before telling me I was "" an absolute cunt"". 

I walk outside and Laura tells me she thinks something has attached itself to Emily through the ouija board. All the cussing and attitude was not her Emily. The bruising was messed up and she was going to get help from one of her healing friends and her son, who was also a healer.
Laura makes a few calls and these guys are at the house before emily has finished her bath. They call Emily out into the lounge and tell her what's going to happen. Emily reluctantly agreed to the healing and Laura took her place behind Emily's head and acted as the guide. Her son was there to ""earth"" the proceedings and Laura's friend, Marie was there as a helping hand to lend energies. I stood at the sidelines and watched this thing go down.

They managed to get thing attachment out of Emily. But not after she thrashed around for  30 minutes, calling us every name under the sun. Toward the end after Laura told it to leave her daughter, emily let out this weird two-toned-male ""roar"" that shook me to my very soul. I have never heard anything quite so terrifying, and I'll never forget it. Truly awful thing to ever hear. The entity had a name, but I have sworn never to repeat it. 

After the healing was over, the three of them said that at various stages of the healing, heard whispering, felt cold hands grabbing at them trying to pull them away from the healing and away from Emily. Flashes of fury was experienced by all three at some stage during the healing. About 10 minutes after, the three of them noticed the same bruises that were on Emily's body, were now on theirs where the cold hands had been grabbing at them. They all felt sick and individually went to go and throw up. Laura was the last and came back saying she had flies in her vomit. We all went and checked it out, ( totally gross I know but it's not everyday you see that) sure enough amongst all the bile were three winged bluebottles, still moving. Laura was not in the habit of eating flies just to assure you. This was pretty much a result of whatever was inside Emily has manifested itself into Laura, or tried to. I still don't really an explanation for the bluebottle flies. All I know is that I saw what  I saw. Heard what I heard.

Anyway, Emily is now ok. She has unfortunately learned the lesson of not to mess around with ouija boards the hard way. She said it was physically painful to have the entity taken out of her, and she also apologised profusely to all of us for her mistake and her unpleasant way she spoke and acted. She said she was aware of what she was saying but couldn't do anything about it, it was like she was watching a movie through her own eyes. 

I hope you all enjoyed reading and I hope that some of you have possibly learned from others mistakes. Please, for your own sake don't mess around with ouija boards and any other form of ""dark energies"". An ouija board is a portal that will let anything in. People say you can use them correctly, and it will them be safe if you do. I think this is bullshit. Sprits and entities can lie cheat and steal. They can be good or bad. When you open that portal, you don't know exactly what you are letting in. So please don't.

1349475716.0,33,self.Thetruthishere,110knv,[me] My experiences in an old southern house and church on old lynching grounds.,floralmuse,35,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/110knv/me_my_experiences_in_an_old_southern_house_and/,"So, I have been lurking on /r/letsnotmeet for a while, but unable to contribute because I don't have any true stories that fit their criteria, so I came here to share what I DID have happen to me. I did read the subrules, but please forgive me if I missed something.

When I was young (6-13) I lived in a house out in the countryside in SC. I had several strange experiences there and my most vivid memories of the house all include being terrified and feeling like I was being watched from the woods, and through windows. The house was on property that had been the site of a gruesome lynching you can read about [here](http://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/689) (note that this was near Greenwood, as stated in the article. Greenville is stated in the heading, and I assume this to be a mistake.) In the effort to remain anonymous I've linked to an article that does not give the exact address, but it was a church yard. I lived in a house that was next to the church on the same property. 

Also, note that at the time my parents decided (rightfully so) that I didn't need to know about the killings and did not reveal this to me until we had moved to another city. So, there was no possibility of me being spooked about the stories and seeing ""ghosts"" because I was expecting it. Also, all of the phenomenon stopped completely when I moved out of the house, excluding the possibility of it being in my head.

As I said, I always felt like I was being watched. I HATED being alone, and I couldn't stand having my blinds or curtains open at night, even though it was a mile to the nearest house and there was next to no chance that anyone (corporeal) could see me. I would see things moving around and shadows shifting out of the corner of my eye, and there would be nothing there. At night I would hear your standard old house creepy sounds, but occasionally stranger things would happen. I frequently laid awake, too afraid to sleep until I was exhausted. One night a marble rolled out of my closet. It was an old house, so at first I thought it might be just that the floorboards had shifted slightly. The marble kept rolling though, back and forth over the entire course of the room for several minutes before it rolled under my bed and stopped. 

Another night I turned over in my bed and saw a shadowy figure standing next to my bed. It was like he was made of a 3d shadow material, almost like dense dark smoke within a human shaped force field. He had a hat on, that looked like an old style straw hat. I wasn't frightened of this one at the time for some reason. I was startled but not fearful. Later on, when I was in college and lurking on /x/ on 4chan I saw a picture of him and learned that other people see him and call him the ""hatman"". I nearly shit my pants. He had always seemed like the most explainable, that maybe I fell asleep and just dreamed him, but the confirmation that other people see him, and he was EXACTLY the same... that just kind of blew my mind for a few weeks. 

Yet another experience, I was in the church sanctuary, going to practice piano. It was dark when I climbed into the choir loft, with a streetlight providing some illumination through the stained glass windows. Just as my hand touched the light switch, a silhouette of a person walked between me and the window. I panicked and flipped all the switches on the panel, and there was no one in the room.  

My most terrifying encounter was when my parents had a meeting at the church, so they left me in the fellowship hall (activity center type building) to watch a movie. It was separated from the main building by an open air breezeway (adjacent to the graveyard). I went to get some water from the kitchen, and through the small window in the door to the breezeway there was a face. It was white, and had large black areas for its eyes. It either had no eyes or they were so sunken I couldn't see them. I don't remember noticing much of a mouth, I just kept staring at it's ""eyes"". I froze completely. All the hair on my body stood up and I broke into a cold sweat. I just was so terrified. I had nowhere to run, as it was blocking my path back to the adults. After what seemed like forever I slowly backed out of the kitchen area with the door and sat back next to the tv, and waited until my mom came to get me. I didn't tell her about it until years later. I still have a bit of a phobia about darkened windows.

When I told my parents about all of this later they admitted what they knew about the history of the property, and my father confessed he had seen the white face once, looking into a window in another area of the church, and my mother said she too saw the shapes and shadows shifting around the house.

So that's it. I apologize for the length. Feel free to ask questions, and if you can think of any other proof I can provide besides the article I'll try to provide. I'd like to avoid revealing the exact address because that would make it fairly easy to determine the identity of my family and the church which is a very lovely place full of lovely people in this century (although if you get into old newspaper clippings you can find it, please don't post here if you do)",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_110knv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/110knv/me_my_experiences_in_an_old_southern_house_and/,

1337195066.0,29,self.Thetruthishere,tqd9w,[ME] I psychically predicted a life-threatening injury.,stackolee123,38,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tqd9w/me_i_psychically_predicted_a_lifethreatening/,"I'm so glad you folks exist.  nosleep just didn't seem like the place for this.  Although I've been lurking forever, this is my first post to Reddit. Hopefully I have the format down.  

A little background:  I'm in my mid-30's, and although I moved around the country for years, I've always had a strong relationship with my  family.  In fact, about 10 years ago, I decided to take what money I'd accumulated and put it on the line to go into business with my father.  I saw him everyday and we worked well together, he became my best friend. The business was a modest success.  I guess it's relevant to note that during the time we worked together, he developed Diabetes, which he failed to control with anything approaching discipline.  So his health was certainly on everyone's minds. 

My then-girlfriend (now wife) and I decided to buy a house.  Because this necessitated saving a little more cash than we had on hand, she moved in with her dad and I moved in with my parents. Our plan was to hang out for 4-6 months in our respective familial digs and then buy a house, which is basically how it went.  

Anyway, I'm in 'my room,' basically a closet in my parents' house with baseboard heating.  I'm reading and drinking Jack Daniels.  Not too much this particular evening-I certainly wasn't drunk (although it did become a habit I had to drop later on.)  

It was about 11 pm when I felt- honestly, as I'm writing this it's becoming clear to me it's going to be very difficult to describe it- that my (consciousness? being?) had ""shifted"" a physically-measurable inch 'above' where it normally 'rests'.  NOT what you'd describe as an out-of-body experience at all, because i certainly didn't see myself from above or anything.  But things felt feverish, and I felt not all there.  If I were you, I'd think it was the whiskey, but trust me, I know whiskey as well as I know anything, and it wasn't the whiskey. I then literally felt compelled to take a pencil and a sheet of paper and begin writing.  I went over to a bureau and began drawing/scribbling frenzied circles from the center of the page outward.  I began crying as I scribbled.  Then I wrote 'MY HEAD,' and 'MY HEAD HURTS' (it didn't, at all) and wrote the word 'cheesesteak' several times, which may make my physical location pretty easy to identify, but whatever.  I was, at the time, like I said, worried about my father's health, and he just wouldn't lay off the horrible foods.  

After about 10 minutes of what I'd describe as this really abnormal behavior, I went to bed completely drained, and I don't remember falling asleep.  The next morning, I got a call at about 7am.  My father had slipped on ice, fracturing his skull.  For about 3 days, we had no idea if he was going to live or die- he had several 'brain bleeds' and they kept him in a medically-induced coma for I think 4 days.  He ended up getting through it, although he did permanently lose his sense of smell, and was a somewhat different person after the accident.  He also shared that he swore he was 'with' family members (in corporeal form) that had passed.  This was after they stopped with the coma-inducing drugs.  We got to keep my father in our lives until this past fall, when he died of an unrelated cause.  I never mentioned the paper to my father. 

I only showed the paper to my wife, who threw it out (failing to mention this to me) when we moved from the house we originally bought after we moved out of our parents' places.  It just bothered her too much, and I can't say I'm unhappy with that at all now.  I was thinking 'Reddit will never believe it just got thrown away,' but what the hell, I could just draw up a new one if i wanted to make shit up, right?

Anyway, as a result of this event, there's no doubt in my mind that things aren't what they seem, and it's still really, really jarring to think about.  A I-wish-it-hadn't-happened level of jarring.  And I know there's no direct way to link the 'information' on the paper to his accident, but it's really just, too much for me to write off.  

Thanks so much for reading this, it's honestly therapeutic to write it out, especially after his passing.  


edit: grammar, and man, that was long.

TL;DR: I predicted my father falling and fracturing his skull the night before it happened.

This happened several years ago when me and my friends were in seventh grade, now for years me and all my friends had creepy feelings in my basement that was fixed up for me and my brother to live in, I was the only one that stayed my brother was always to afraid to sleep down there. So one night me and two of my friends decided to do a little ghost hunt through the basement, it started off normal nothing out of the ordinary, we went through every room and and asked some questions, when we thought we were done we realized we left the door to my room open, so thinking the ghost may have gone in there we went in there to finish the night.

Once in the room we all sat in a circle near the door, with it shut, and lit two candles, setting down the lighter next to them and shut off the light, we then blew out the candles leaving the only light in the basement a small pin prick of light from my tape recorder. We started asking the ghost questions as we were doing this, the red light on the recorder went out for a second like something was moving over it. After a few minutes of questions we told it to leave, and when we said that there was a sound like a flapping wing behind my friends in front of where my closet was.

We were done and reached down to pick up the lighter to lit the candles and could not find it. we turned on the light and there was no lighter there, we opened the door and there was my lighter all the way across the basement standing up on a table. Now we were all sitting cross legged in that room with the door shut so I would've known if someone had gotten up either from the door opening or not felling their knees touching mine,

We were all left with one question, what moved my lighter?

This isn't a copy/paste of that story, since it was years ago and I don't have it saved. I'm not a very good writer, forgive me.
This occurred in our Sophomore year of high school in mid May.

My friend's name is Emilee. She's very different from me, she's got nerves of steel. On that night in, I saw her legitimately frightened for the first time.

Emilee's house is around 130 years old. I had stayed over at her house a number of times, but for some reason or another we weren't ever alone. The layout of her house is interesting, I've made a simplified version of it [here](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/843/layoutbh.png/).
Note that her deck is newer than the rest of her house. It was built by her father, and is only accessible via the bigger living room. It's mostly used for storage and it gives us all the creeps.
Anyway, it was around 23:00, and we were tired and winding down from a night of zombie games. She said she wanted to take a shower, so I agreed to stay in the bigger living room and watch tv. 

I always felt uncomfortable when alone in her house. Her whole family agreed that there are a few spirits there. A young boy who died of pneumonia, an old woman who died of a stroke, and some other entities they weren't sure of. I was always creeped out thinking of this, especially when sitting on the couch so late. Her sister and her parents were all out of town, so I couldn't talk to them. I called my (now ex) boyfriend and spoke with him for a while, when I heard a weird noise coming from the deck. It was short, almost sounded like boxes of glass being shifted. My call dropped. The lightbulb over my head burst.

Scared, I decided to move to the smaller living room which is closer to the bathroom. After what seemed like forever I heard the shower turn off. After some movement, she called my name. I entered the bathroom and she was pointing at the mirror. 
As I'm sure you've noticed, when you touch steamy mirrors it leaves an imprint. Well, it looked like someone had drawn a picture of a woman crying. I thought Emilee had drawn it. ""I swear to God that wasn't me,"" she said, reading my mind. 
""Well, if there are fingerprints on the mirror, the steam would make them appear again,"" I responded.
We brushed it off and went back into the big living room. As we settled down on the couch and got ready to sleep, the television went out. Just stopped. It wouldn't turn back on. ""Fuse box?"" I guessed.
The fan turned on. The switch is in the master bedroom.

I was getting scared out of my mind already. Emilee wasn't really phased, but she was wondering how the fan turned on. ""The power is obviously working,"" she said. 
We started to calm down again, when the tv turned on by itself. There was only static.
I still thought maybe Emilee was fucking with me; she likes to pull shit like this all the time.

But then, CRASH.
The noises coming from that deck were INSANE. It sounded like a toddler throwing a fit, if the toddler was strong enough to throw a pool table. We looked out there, and nothing had moved.
But the noises were still there. A strange hissing noise accompanied the crashing. I started crying, I was so scared. 

We ran into the kitchen, the closest source of light. Emilee quickly made hex bags - which, I'll admit I know nothing about so I have no idea if they were legit. She told me to get into her bedroom while she finished the hex bags. I complied, but on the way I checked the bathroom.

There were no marks on the mirror.



The crashing continued through the night, and seemed to move through the house, but avoided her room after she put in the hex bags. We were too scared to sleep. 
Evidently, the entity in her house that night really doesn't like me, because she's never had that happen again. And I refuse to sleep over there anymore.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_mmgfr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/mmgfr/mefr_why_i_wont_sleep_at_her_house/,

Later, when I turned out the lights I layed down and suddenly creepy/scary/horrible images were flashing though my mind.  After trying to dismiss it, I tried to go to sleep.

One day we were at her house and were talking to her dad about ghosts and shit (we had done a ouija board the night before so were pretty excited). Her dad started telling us this story about why he forbids is to ever mess with that shit and why he is no longer a catholic (as a child he and his family were huge Catholics). He told us that as a child, living in Spain, he and all the kids in his neighbourhood would play this game, I can't remember the name but it involves a large field. There was a small one room building at one side of the field and they used to go inside and try and invite the devil to play. The tradition was that as soon as you had conjured him everyone would have to run across the field. Once you had gotten through the field you were safe from him. You weren't allowed to turn back as it was against the rules. One day they were playing this game, they all ran out of the room and as my friends dad was running away he looked back and saw through the window that his cousin was still in the room and trying to get out but the door was locked. Because of the game rules the kids couldn't run back to help him until they had gotten to the other side of the field. As they were running back they heard the boy screaming and ran into the room where they found him on the floor covered in blood with scratches and wounds all over his body. My friends dad was traumitised to repeat the story and he said that ever since that day he has completely left the church.

For instance, during Christmas we'll set up this decoration with a key on it that you turn for it to play music. Sometimes it'll play by itself without anyone turning the key. Other times the volume on the TV will go all the way up without anyone touching the remote or the TV will even turn on by itself. Little things like that. I've never seen anything until a few weeks ago. 

I was sleeping when I woke up at about 3 A.M., like I did every day that week. Nothing really woke me up, I just got up for no reason. But this time, I saw someone standing at the foot of my bed. It looked like a woman wearing a nightgown with curly hair. At first I thought it was my mom watching me sleep. I just stayed there in bed for a few minutes with my eyes closed laying still, hoping she would leave. After a couple minutes I opened my eyes and the woman was still there. I blinked a few times just to make sure I wasn't seeing things and the woman didn't move. I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to startle whoever was standing there so I didn't move for a couple more minutes, but the person did not go away from the foot of my bed. At this point I've had enough and was getting freaked out so I turned to click on the lamp and when I turned my head back the lady was gone. 

My head was turned for no more than a second and there was no one at the foot of my bed anymore. But for some reason I wasn't freaked out  anymore. It was creepier for me to think that my mom was watching me sleep than some ghost was. 

I turned all the lights on and looked around the room. No one was there, my door was closed, and everything was good. So I went back to bed without really caring that a ghost was watching me sleep for who knows how long. My only explanation is that they wanted me to see them for a while. Maybe she was watching over me or something and wanted to let me know.

1374377378.0,34,self.Thetruthishere,1iqdmn,[ME][FR] What's entered my apartment??,sayn,38,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1iqdmn/mefr_whats_entered_my_apartment/,"This might be long, but bear with me because I need some help identifying what's going on. Before I start, let me note that the two roommates in this story and I have lived in this apartment all year with nothing like this happening until the time shown below.

**Three weeks ago**

My roommate and I were hanging out and talking spirituality. We're both fairly into this stuff and he explained to me that he likes to keep any mattresses or free beds open for whatever spirits are out by pulling the covers. He doesn't try to invite them into our lives, just provides them a place to stay for the night if they need a bed. 

**Two weeks ago**

My roommate is having trouble sleeping for three nights. On the third night, he notices a **static black shadow** on the ceiling lingering directly over where he's sleeping. His curtains are shut, no lights in his room, so he gets up off his bed to see if he's causing it somehow. Nope, still there. He hops back into bed and is still uncomfortable in his same spot so he moves over to the right and immediately feels comfort. He explains it like he was sharing the bed with someone else. Within ten minutes he passes out.

Next morning he asks me if I remember why he keeps an extra mattress. I tell him I do. He then points at this mattress we have at the end of our living room that we keep on the floor for friends who need a place to crash. For the past three nights, it's been *up* because he and my other roommate laid it against the wall to set up a table. He immediately puts it down and throws some pillows and a blanket over this.

**The next night**

My girlfriend comes over and we're laying on my bed as I explain to her the creepiness that just happened to my friend. As I'm telling her, we hear **two solid knocks** coming from the other side of my wall. No one is home. She suspects my cat making noise, but he's sleeping on my chair in front of us. Fast-forward a few hours, we're on the couch watching Netflix and the light on the **lamp next to me starts flickering**. I've NEVER seen it do this.

The next morning she tells me before she went to sleep, while closing her eyes she saw an *old lady's face* randomly. She also had a **weird dream** that we were still in my room, everything was the same including our clothes, positioning on the bed, and my room, and someone had opened the door, YELLING for me to get up and get out. She said she vividly remembers this person was **angry**, she thought it was one of my friends but it wasn't, and that the anger was directed at me.

I tell this story to my roommate (static shadow guy) the next night while we're on the couch. As I'm telling him this, we both hear our **front door get slammed** as if someone was shoulder checking it from the outside. I look through the peephole, nothing. I look in the hallway, nothing.

**The next night**

It's 11pm, I go into the kitchen to fill up my water bottle. As I'm filling it up in the sink, I hear someone whisper in my left ear **'hey'**. I thought it was my roommate (not static shadow guy) because he does shit like that so I turn around, no one is there. Before I continue, let me be clear that **I did NOT imagine this**. I wasn't thinking about anything paranormal or freaking myself out. I distinctly heard the word 'hey' being said. My cat is running around outside my kitchen door and as I take a step towards him, he runs to the end of the hall to where my bathroom is and gets in a *defensive pounce position*. I walk over to my room, which is close to the bathroom and he isn't running away, he's still in pounce position and *his focus is still on the kitchen*.

**Last night/This morning**

We threw a party at our place. After the party (around 4am), my roommate (not static shadow guy) is getting water from the kitchen. He then heard someone behind him say **'get out of my room'** in a *low male voice*. Turns around, the only people still awake are on the balcony and swear to not have said anything. I'll also note that he was not high or drunk at this point, just getting ready for bed and he swears to have heard it right behind him.

My other roommate said he talked to one of the guys who came at the end of the party who's really knowledgeable when it comes to spiritual stuff like this. He said something along the lines of our **energies are imbalanced** in this apartment, that we're no longer **living in harmony** with each other and doing so is causing sparks of energy in our apartment, which is causing these situations to happen. He recommended that we **fix our relationships**. He's not wrong about us being a bit at each other's throats, but here's the freaky bit: as my roommate is telling me this, we go to his room where he shows me a Buddhist scroll that he used to have hanging on his wall. One of the nails is out and it's now now laying on the floor. It reads (and I shit you not):

&gt;*Peace comes when energies are in harmony and relationships are in balance*

**Conclusion**

I'd like to know what is causing all this. My girlfriend is saying that it could either be an intelligent haunting or a demon. I hate to say it, but I'm leaning toward demon or something dark. I can tell it likes the attention because it only shows signs that it's around when we're talking about our experiences or talking about it. Sometimes, I'm almost certain I can feel it hovering around me or near me and I can sense where it might be. I feel like it is trying to fuck with us. What can I do to help it go away?

Once when i was younger i told her that some of my friends were talking about Ouija boards and she flipped out, telling me that i was absolutely under no circumstances to touch one of those things and that they are dangerous.  I always thought that was a little wierd since we had never really spoken about that stuff.  Later on when i was in my teens we started watching things like Most Haunted together and she was pretty into psychic medium shows.

Last month we were watching one of these shows and sharing a bottle of wine.  I asked her if she had ever experienced anything paranormal.  She looked at me a little hesitant to tell me (she has always been very over protective and would never want to tell me anything that would scare me in any way) then she told me the following:

When she was around my age (21), every night when she went to bed she would be terrorized by some unseen being.  She would have the covers ripped off of her, she would be slaped in the face, things around the room would move and her bed would be shook violently.

Its quite odd because as a child i always hated her old room.  I never felt completely safe there unless i was with one of my grandparents.

I asked me dad about this, but he is a huge skeptic.  He said he had done a little research and that apparently this is fairly common in girls who are reaching a stage in their lives where they are going through alot of change.  At the time this happened to her she was engaged to my father and was still living with her parents.  After they got married and they moved in together (and started sleeping in the same bed) all of this stopped immediately.
  
She also had one other ghostly encouner aroud the same time.  Before my mum met my dad he was engaged to another woman named Jane.  One night while they were out driving a drunk police officer hit their car head on - my dad survived and Jane was killed instantly.  Shortly before my mum and dads wedding Jane appeared to my mother in her bedroom.  She stood in the doorway and smiled at her.

I was on the top bunk with my father on the bunk underneath me. After sitting still for a minute I turned around and at the end of the farthest table in the cabin (picture a long cabin with bunks on each side and tables in the midde. maybe 3 or 4) I saw a man sitting. I asked him why he was awake. He didn't respond. I got out of bed slowly as to not wake anyone and went over to see if he fell asleep sitting up.

When I arrived to tug his shoulder he vanished. I turned around to face my bunk and there he was: Standing still directly beside my bunk! I ran over and hopped into bed as fast as humanly possible. (How absurd right? Run towards the ""man"") Upon getting in my bed I vomited over the edge about three or four times - wiped my mouth - then fell back asleep.

When I was awoken by my father the next morning he said he wanted to make some breakfast with me before anyone got up so we could fill up. I asked him if he was the one to clean the throw up and he told me he didn't see any when he came in or any when he got up to sleep in his truck because of some guys snoring.

I believe the areas history with the Civil War played a large role on many of my experiences.

The house I lived in from age 2-8 was just your average house, wasn't particularly old/creepy/etc.  It was a split level house with my parents bedroom and my bedroom in the basement and my 2 brothers rooms upstairs.  My bedroom had a sidedoor that led directly outside, it was actually supposed to be the master bedroom I guess, my parents rational was that if there was a fire they could grab me and run out the door easier.  Well, from as young as I can remember I would see shadow people in my room at night.  Not just one person but a group, walking around, like they were pacing or circling the room.  If I got up to go to the bathroom they would follow me.  For whatever reason, I was never afraid of this.  Tried to ask my mom about it and she told me my eyes were ""playing tricks"" on me or I was dreaming, I stopped talking to her about it. The only time I ever became scared in that house was when my parents were away on a business trip,  my grandmother was staying with us to babysit.  I was sleeping and something woke me up, as I looked around my room the shadow people  were over by the side door just standing there and their non movement is what freaked me out.  I ran into my parents room where my grandma was sleeping and slept with her the rest of the night.  A few days after my dad got back he noticed that it looked like someone had tried to pry the deadbolt open on the side door.

When I was in kindergarten my mom would pull me out of school to go on picnics every once in awhile.  Our favorite spot was at this creek where there was this old stone bridge. Every once in a while I would hear these loud booms but my mom never heard them. Years later I think that it was probably the sound of cannons.

At age fourteen my first dog, Max, had to be put down because he had a stroke, I was the one that was holding him while he passed.  I was pretty devastated and cried all night.  That night I had a dream about him coming home and jumping into bed with me.  The next morning I found his favorite toy in the middle of the floor in my room, it should have been downstairs in his basket.

I was just reading a book of letters sent to Fortean Times magazine. People sending in their strange or paranormal experiences. Something in there caught my eye. I think you might like it.


These are the letters:


Back around 1975 when I was nine, some of the kids I knocked around with insisted we all pile into the nearest phone box to hear a spooky message. By dialing a number - I think it was made up of zeros, twos and ones - and without needing to insert two pence, a woman, speaking in a curiously monotone voice, could be heard saying ""Help me, help me, Susie's dying"" over and over. Some of the lads said she sometimes said ""Help me, help me Susie's drowning"" - always in the same slow, seemingly bored tone of voice. Was it some weird engineer's test signal (hence no money needed)? *-Rob Dickinson, Worsthorne, Lancashire, UK. 2000.*


I can remember once cramming into a phone box in the Stoneyholme area of Burnley with various other kids to hear the strange message related by Rob Dickinson. I cannot remember the number dialed. Could this be an early example of EVP (electronic voice phenomenon), or just inexplicable interference on the telephone system, filtered through the active imaginations of young witnesses? *-Christopher McDermott, London. 2000.*


I remember the spooky message when I was a child playing with the old red phone boxes in Burnley. Two phone boxes in particular were prone to mysterious scary voice messages - one at the top of Dalton Street on Planetree Estate and the other at the end of Harold Street on Stoops Estate. As I remember, you put 2p in the slot and dialled 20 20 20 20 and the voice on the other end would be crackly but audible, ""Help me, Susie's dying"", which would send us kids running in all directions. *-AG Russell-Dallamore, by email. 2003.*


I am from Burnley and have a vivid memory of the strange phone message. In either 1980 or 1981, three other girls and myself were loitering with the intent not to go back to school after lunch. We were messing around in a phone box near to school, calling random numbers and talking rubbish if anyone answered (we thought it was funny!). One of the girls said she knew a number you could call to hear a ""spooky message"" - I think there were 3s and 2s in it. When she called this number we all heard the message as quoted in previous correspondence. I have no doubts as to the phrasing of what I heard. It was a clear voice with no audible distortion. Needless to say, we were all a bit freaked out by this and when a British Telecom van pulled up nearby we made a hasty retreat and returned to school. *-Tracey Maclean, Knaresborough, North Yorkshire. 2003.*


I'd be very interested to hear if anyone has heard any similar stories about this message.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_wgmer,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/wgmer/help_me_susies_dying_disleg/,

I thought I’d share it with you guys; it still gives me the creeps over ten years later. 

Some context; this happened in 1998. I was seven years old at the time, I was seven years old at the time and lives in a small town in the middle of rural Wales. Once you got into the country, most of the roads were in the typical UK style bordered by wild hedges to either side.
I barely remember the incidents that happened here, so most of what is said is  from what my parents have told me over the years.

It all starts on a late Autumn night. My mother, father, me, and my grandmother were returning home from a secluded picnic day-out to a quiet beauty spot about an hour and a half drive away from home; a valley called Abergwesyn. On the way back we would generally take the longer route home via the very narrow country roads as we could pass through the village of Llangammarch which was a favourite haunt of my grandmother when she was a teenager and would generally be accompanied by a funny story.  It was very dark, approaching 8pm, and it had clouded over; so the country backroad was completely devoid of illumination apart from the car headlights. We're driving pretty slow. I was asleep in the back, cuddled up to my grandmother, while my parents are in the front with the radio quietly on.

Suddenly, my mother notices something very odd in the wing-mirror of the passenger seat. The taillights are reflecting in something behind the car. My mother is one of those people who will always point out anything odd, interesting, or unusual, straight away, to whomever is present; and so immediately tells my father that she thinks a car is following them. He glances out of his mirror, and sees nothing. But my mother is insistent that there is a reflection of something behind us.

My grandmother now chips in and agrees with my mother that she too can see something out of the back window. My father still tries to tell them that they are wrong, its impossible; and that he's trying to drive and would they kindly be quiet.

A few minutes pass. And then my mother exclaims; ""Look! It's a registration plate!"" Behind our car, only a half metre from the back bumper is the outlines of a vehicle registration plate reflected in our taillights. There's a car following us and it is completely blacked out and devoid of any lights. My mother begins to panic (hell, I don't blame her), my father still can't see a thing and is beginning to get aggravated at the entire situation, and I wake up and wonder WTF is going on. 

My mother is getting hysterical, my grandmother trying to calm her down and my father attempting to provide a rational explanation. He thinks it could be a trick of the light or an optical illusion of some sort. Then I, apparently, wound down my window and poked my head out the back. I exclaim that I can see the outlines of tire arches and can hear another car over the wind and the sound of our engine.

Mother begins to panic again, and starts jumping to all sorts of awful conclusions (that it’s a stolen car full of criminals, that it is IRA terrorists, all sorts). Through this commotion, we miss the turning we needed to get back to our town. My father, totally exasperated, slows down making for a gate in which he can turn the car around in. I look back and see I can no longer see the outline of any car. Everyone goes silent as we begin to execute a three point turn. The headlights flash around and illuminate...nothing. The road is empty behind us. There was no way any car could have gotten past us without us knowing, and there was nowhere else for a car to go, as high and thick edges blocked the road in on either side. My father, smug that he was right and there really wasn't a car, continues down the right road for home.

About 5 minutes pass, in which no one really does or says anything to each other. I keep on turning around in my seat looking out the back window for any sign of the car. By this time, some of the clouds have begun to part, and the surroundings are, if not visible, are just about discernible. And then I see it again. A car, definitely a car, quietly pulling up behind us. It's close, very close. Our white taillights are shining off of its registration plate and the chrome around the engine. I can just about make out the edges of the windscreen, but nothing else. I can't see into the car itself. It's not some sort of reflection of our own car; it is a completely different type. 
I quietly whisper to my grandmother what I can see, and she turns around, and then quietly suggests to my parents to do the same. My mother goes dead still and inhales sharply; you can tell she is really very frightened now. My father exclaims in surprise, as he can now see it too. We all begin to debate what to do. My father and grandmother want to stop at the nearest farm we come too, but my mother absolutely forbids him and just wants to get home as soon as possible. I'm keeping a constant vigil on the car behind us. After a while we all agree to just keep driving until we get to the well lit village of Llangammarch, which should be fairly soon. Minutes go by. The car behind us stays with us, only about a metre away. Keeping up with our pace; not dropping back, not coming any nearer. 

Everyone is pretty much silent by this point, until we begin to near the glow indicating the lights of Llangammarch. The air in the car is tense. Suddenly, I see the car accelerate forward, almost hitting us. It comes within inches of our back bumper. My father, who has also been keeping an eye, shouts out, and accelerates to compensate, while my mother lets out a brief shriek and my grandmother holds me tight. We are now having to go uncomfortably fast for the road conditions, definitely breaking the speed limit, but the car behind us has stopped accelerating and is keeping pace, albeit too fast a pace, again. Then, the car whips around the corner onto a road with (thankfully) street lights. We all turn to look behind us. There's nothing there. The car that was within touching distance of our car has gone. Vanished. Everyone is speechless; there is no way the car could have turned off, nowhere for it to go.

The rest of the journey goes by totally uneventfully. We soon turn onto a road with semi-regular streetlights. I keep on clamouring and asking questions, expecting one of the adults to explain to me what the heck just happened. No one can give me an answer. And we still can't, to this day, explain the events of that night.


As an addendum, I have shown the route we took that night here:

There have really only been two times that I've seen something I thought was actually malicious or outright negative, and I made a post about the more recent of the two, which can be found on this subreddit.

The story of the terrarium goes like this: I was around 8 or 9, and my Mom had gotten me this terrarium from the antique store that my Grandmother owned. It was diamond shaped and made from glass. It had wooden edging, a base to stand on, and the back portion/wall of the terrarium was cut from a piece of mirror.

I really liked said terrarium and wanted to put plants and things in it, which I did eventually. After it was all full of dirt and growing grass and other little plants, I kept it on my bedside table, and basically got used to/forgot about it for awhile until one afternoon when I was playing in my room. 
I was drawing pictures and hanging out, when I looked up at my terrarium. Instead of seeing my own face reflected in the mirror that made up the back portion of the terrarium, I saw another face there. It was ugly and smiling, with gray skin and big white teeth and beady eyes. 
Naturally, I freaked out and ran to my Mom, telling her what I had seen. I refused to go back in to my room until my Mom went into my bedroom and bodily removed the terrarium, which I ended up giving to my Grandpa for Father's Day because I was so creeped out by it that I didn't want it anymore.

When I was 7, I use to live in a building that my dad (engineer with his own business) had designed, built and named after my mom. The building had 4 units, 1 on each floor plus a basement unit with a seperate entrance.


One had to climb up few steps, open the main door in order to get inside. To the left of these steps was a wall and to the right was a hand railing for support. The basement door was beside this railing but at basement level so there was more of less a large gap in the ground.


It was a cloudy day but not dark. I was standing at the railing chatting with my friends when all of a sudden, as if my perspective shifted, I was few meters behind my own body, my head lowered to my body's ankle level, looking at my physical self standing there. I only experienced it for few seconds but I know what I saw. 2 hands grabbed my ankles. These hands were pale, not dead skin pale but very pale. They belonged to a girl who was floating. There was no sound, only a calm feeling (that's the best way I can put it). I was instantly back in my real body, felt a ""hypnotic jerk"" and everything went black.


[Visual of the setting and the incident.](http://i.imgur.com/MMfqI.jpg)
Please note the basement was a bit lower than what is shown in the picture. There was a lot more space around the door.

If that wasn't eerie enough, what happened next is even more so. I was back at home, in my bed. I woke up with a massive headache and began questioning my mom and my twin (who was with me when I fell) about the accident. She informed me that I walked upstairs (the building had no elevator) by myself, told her that I had fallen and then I fell asleep for few hours (it was bright and sunny when I was outside, I woke up at dusk). 

I am 20 now and to this day, I am still certain that I did not climb 4 stories. I denied it then, I will deny it now. I also don't recall the events after I fell but apparently, I was conscious enough to walk upstairs and have a normal conversation. I don't rule out the possibility of my brain being deceptive as I am very skeptical but this the strangest experience I've had.

I have had a few strange experiences in my life, ranging from the weird to the banal, but the one I will share is the one that terrified me the most, it's the one I will never forget, and the one I'll try my best to convey to you.

I live in rural Northern Ireland, in a small neighborhood surrounded by vast fields and ocean views. My father's side of the family had been brought up here, and lo and behold, my father thought it would be fine if his children were brought up there to. My dad and uncles would occasionally tell us strange stories about what happened to them whilst growing up, things like banshees, poltergeists and weird things like my uncle seeing the ghost of a young girl hanging herself on a tree near the house. They always said the farm used to be a workhouse in famine times, a terrible place where farmers slaved for hours to earn a pittance, but I usually didn't believe these stories, I just enjoyed the chills I would get from listening to them.

One night I was working late, till 11pm. It was in the winter and the weather had taken a turn for the worst. Snow and ice had overcome the roads, and the roadworkers were doing their best to make sure the main roads stayed clear. Unfortunately, this did not include the little rural area I lived in. My friend at work kindly offered to leave me at the bottom of our road, for it has a sharp incline (we call it the 'brae', Gaelic for hill) and it was covered with ice; my parents could not get out of our house to lift me.

My friend dropped me of at the bottom of our road and I began my walk home. I had about half a mile to go; not bad under normal conditions, quite bad in the dark with a lot of snow and ice. After I made it up the hill, I was finally walking past my neighbours houses. I enjoyed the lights of their houses, and was glad that I wasn't in the dark anymore, but soon I came to the last house and the last light faded away behind me. I was back in the dark.

I approached the area where my father and his family grew up and I immediately thought of everything I was ever told about the area. My hair was on end, my eyes darted around trying to make sure the area was clear, but now I know I was silly to even attempt this. The moon gave a little light and the snow looked strange, I padded on through the snow and kept thinking about the next house which would come up.

Suddenly I heard three, loud, heavy footsteps come from behind me in the snow. *Crunch* *crunch* *crunch*. I felt something grab the back of my foot, my heel even,  like something was trying to take it off or grab hold. My eyes stared wide and I ran like I never ran before. As I ran I kept thinking that I should look back, that I had to make sure it was real and not something else... But I couldn't.  I was too scared. I sort of felt that that would've been the stupid thing to do.

I finally made it to my house and I ran inside and slammed the door. I told my mom about it, and I told my sisters. Obviously, my mom just laughed and my sisters got quite freaked out. We wondered what on earth it could have been. I wondered if it was my neighbours, but I have decided it couldn't have been because they would have said to me it was them and that they enjoyed scaring me shitless. I know it wasn't a stranger, because why would anyone be out there in the middle of the night, in the snow, waiting to grab someone's foot?

 I haven't told my dad yet because I'm not sure how he would react, but if the subject of the paranormal comes up again, I'll be sure to mention.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_riblk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/riblk/me_having_the_worst_walk_home_ever/,

I first posted there for lack of a place like this to share real experiences (and was even downvoted by the two people who read it) so a big ""Thank you"" to the masterminds.  I am willing to share more detail or other experiences as well.  Thanks again to everyone out there and for sharing things that may otherwise be difficult to share. 

This is short, but very true. To start, I don't discredit the paranormal but I do always look at it with a skeptical mind. I have had several experiences over the years, OBEs, seen UFOs and other non nondescript strange occurrences. Whether I really was out of my body during an OBE I can't say nor can I say that there were aliens in those UFOs. But what I'm about to tell you did happen. I know it, I saw it and it happened to me. I went to a non-traditional college to learn a trade in my mid twenties. I thought I was to old for the college experience but lived in a dorm and played beer pong with the best of them. I was an experienced partier and party I did. This college was known for the wild side as is the trade I studied for. Despite all the heavy drinking I managed to make it to all my classes, and eventually graduated without error, but sometime in the middle of my schooling something in me changed. Usually I'm a fairly happy-go-lucky guy and I had never dealt with depression before so it surprised me when it set in. One day, for no reason, I just got sad. I felt like I wanted to cry. I did cry. I knew this feeling was unreasonable. I had friends, I had money, I was passing my classes, but I was unbearably sad. I didn't want to drink or smoke or talk to anyone. I went out of my way to avoid people. Horrible, horrible thoughts crept into my head. Thoughts of death, of murder and of suicide. I just got chills writing this as I recalled how overpowering those thoughts were. This went on for maybe two weeks. Just long enough for me to be fed up with this feeling and those thoughts. I was coming to a head with the depression. I can't say if I ever would have gone through with anything like murder or suicide. I don't think I would but the visions and thoughts continued to chip away at my reasoning. On this particular day I skipped class to be alone. I was feeling that school was a waste anyway, the voices in my head were telling me I was no good, etc. etc. and I laid in my dorm room bed with no music or movies or any sort of stimulation. I just laid there for hours with these thoughts grinding away at me. At some point I had had enough and I said out loud ""Stop it! I don't want to feel this any longer! LEAVE ME ALONE!"" Then it happened. I went into a violent coughing fit. For several minutes I coughed until I felt like I was going to puke. And then, with one last violent and deep cough, it came out. It came out of my mouth and released my body. A black, transparent ""smoke"" flew out of my mouth. How do I know it wasn't dust or some coughing anomaly? Because it had a face. two places for eyes and a mouth turned downward into a frown. I watched it fly out of my body and through the window. I watched it fly in a large corkscrew pattern until it was out of sight. I wiped the coughing tears from my eyes and realized something. I instantly felt better. I felt better than good, I was genuinely happy! All thoughts and feelings were gone and so was that thing. It was gone from me for good and off to latch onto someone else I'm sure. I only prayed that the next victim would be as strong as me.

As requested, a quick drawing of what I saw http://i.imgur.com/Ww9Nfs.jpg (sorry about the size, I'm new at imgur.)

Something else I remembered;  As I coughed, before the thing exited, I coughed up phlegm full of what looked like black strings in it.  Whether or not that means anything I don't know.  It did remind me of stories I've heard or read of people being exorcised before and this type of phlegm being an indicator of possession.

1318271828.0,32,self.Thetruthishere,l7c0m,Odd night in our ambulance,Robert_Tripp,35,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/l7c0m/odd_night_in_our_ambulance/,"Hey /r/thetruthishere, I've been lurking this subreddit for a week or so now and decided that I wanted to share something that happened to me about a year ago. I am not sure if this was paranormal or not, but it scared me near to death and I can't really explain what happened.

To get started, I am a Paramedic. At the time I was the newbie working for a big transfer service in Houston so I was the third person on the unit. We were in a 'vanbulance' so it was pretty small. Part of the 'initiation' I guess is that you have to ride in the back while the regular crew sits in the front. We were working the night shift and generally posted in the Houston Medical Center. Just down the road from two of the biggest hospitals in Texas is a park. It's also next to a zoo and it's generally vacant at night but since we were in an emergency vehicle we were never harassed by the police to leave or anything. We would always park in this big vacant parking lot next to an outdoor pavilion. I was in my second week when this happened to us. 

During the night shift we would generally work 12 hour shifts so we would try and sleep as much as we could. This night it was particularly slow so everyone was in a pretty good mood. I was friends with the other crew (we went to medic school together and he got me the job essentially). I was asleep in the back of the ambulance on the bench seat and the two others were asleep in the front. I was awoken to a loud bang against the side of the unit. It sounded as if somebody took both of their hands and slammed them against the side of the ambulance as hard as they could. This happened to be the side of the unit that the bench was on so I not only heard it, I felt it as well. Funny thing about ambulances is that you can only lock the front cabin with a button and the side and rear doors require you to lock them by hand. My first thoughts were ""Shit I don't know if I locked these doors!"". I promptly went to the side and rear doors to make sure they were locked, and luckily they were. I didn't hear any reaction from my friends up front but by the time I got done locking the doors and going to wake them up there was a second loud bang against the unit. The ambulance was clearly hit by something and rocked back and forth a bit after the hit. From the front of the unit I hear ""Mike what the F--- are you doing back there!?"" And I responded ""Tell dispatch to send a police unit emergency traffic!"" My friend, being a bit stubborn, got out of the unit and looked around to investigate. Mind you, it had to be 3-4 am in the morning at this time. A second or two later he knocked on the back door so I would come out. We looked around for a minute and did not see anything unusual. The 'mood' was tense and we were on our toes. We decided to just leave the area and go get some coffee at a gas station. On the drive over to the gas station my friend and his partner (also his wife) talked about how they have had quite a few 'unusual' experiences in this ambulance. Actually they said that it was definitely 'haunted' and said they have seen faces in the reflections of the glass among other things. To this day I don't know if there was an angry thug kicking the side of the ambulance and running off or if we encountered something paranormal.

Maybe this story will motivate someone to suggest a program!*  
  
.  
This happened to us about 2 months ago. We've been attacked, touched and heard some chilling things before but, personally, nothing tops this experience. I'm not sure what makes it *so* scary to me. It could be the place. It could be the ambiance there. Maybe it's just so full of dark energy that it emanates. Even though we were only there for about an hour or so, it was enough. It began as soon as we arrived, it didn't even give us a chance to get accustomed to the darkness.  
.  
We had visited this spot once before, about a month prior to this visit. I honestly think we had our warning that time, and we didn't listen. The day had been a gorgeous, cloudless day. As night set in, it continued to be clear and lovely. It was a great night to be outside as the moon was clearly seen and it provided enough light. We reached the spot, parked our cars, got our equipment and began our 6 minute walk.   
Not even 2 steps into the tiny road... we were met with a sudden torrential downpour of rain. Out of nowhere, it was suddenly raining like a category 2 hurricane. Giant pellets of water soaking us from head to toe. We had no umbrellas, no rain coats. Why would we? The weather radars showed no rain!  
We were faced with a dilemma, we could try to run back to the car but at this point we were *so* wet, it didn't even matter. We simply tried to cover our gear as much as we could and walked faster.  
Walking down a road that's not even wide enough for one car, at 11pm, whilst it's raining, with just 1 flashlight... it was not a fun time.  
Especially when the area is covered in over 5 foot tall grass. You almost *feel* them looking at you. You don't dare look into the tall grass because you just *know* you're going to look into the eyes of something you don't want to look into.  
.  
Because of the torrential rain, we decided to take shelter in a nearby abandoned building, just outside of the chapel ruins. It's really only about 40 feet away but it was so dark, we couldn't see it. As soon as we stepped into the building, the rain subsided. We were cold and completely soaked and decided to just call it a night and head back out.  
We walked all the way back and decided to return another night.  
This experience begins on that second visit.  
.  
This time the group was a little bigger. It was 3 couples:  
B &amp; C, A &amp; E and my boyfriend and I. B is the group's leader and founder. His wife is C. They have been to this place many times before and have left with a lot of amazing recordings and pictures.  
Even after visiting the same place so many different times, C is completely uncomfortable there. I feel like I have to mention it because this isn't normal behavior for her. Usually, she's pretty fearless and doesn't mind much so to see her so *obviously* rattled at just being near this place was quite shocking.  
A &amp; E are fairly new to the group and they're still quite sensitive and scare very easily. That's not to say that *any* of us aren't scared at every moment. We are. We all jump at sounds, we all sweat and slightly shake but it's exactly why we do it. That fear turns into the adrenaline that pushes us to poke whatever is out there. We just hope we don't get burned...   
.  
To start off, here's a [Google Maps Link](http://g.co/maps/xtgev) to the area. The green arrow is right over the chapel ruins, you can barely see them because it is *so* deteriorated and covered in trees. In the picture, you can also see the long road we must walk to get to it. It is a very tiny road, a car will not pass through it. As you can also see, it's a very desolate area.  
Just before the trail, there is a gasoline station, this is where we usually park our cars and then do the trip on foot.  
We weren't supposed to go ""hunting"" on this night. We were just there because A &amp; E had never been there and we had talked about it many times before, and seeing as B &amp; C lived very nearby, we decided to stop there and check the area out. To say we were not prepared is an understatement. We didn't take any video cameras or microphones as we usually do. Not even a digital recorder. We only had 2 digital camera's (one of which was mine) and my boyfriend was using his cell phone to record sound as best he could.  
.  
It didn't rain on us this night but it had rained earlier in the week and the trail was pretty muddy. About 25 feet into the trail, we reached a point where it was a giant puddle of mud that covered the trail from one side to the other. I was screwed. I was using sandals and I was going to get mud everywhere. I wasn't a happy gal.  The guys crossed it, no problem. Then the other 2 girls went, and I followed. Slowly crossing through the grass and mud. This is when, to my right, I heard a ... grunt? It was a male grunt/throat clear. I'm not sure how to describe it. It was quite loud though, but when I heard it, I payed not attention to it. I guess mud on my toes was slightly more important at the moment.  
After crossing our little ""road block"", we continued to walk. It was very dark and we only had 2 flashlights. Typically, when us girls are starting to get really scared, we will huddle together and hold hands or link our arms together while we walk. This makes us feel better as no one stays behind and we know who's standing next to us at all times.  
As we kept heading forward, B was telling us some curiosities and stories/experiences about the place. I wasn't really listening as I was getting increasingly uncomfortable, feeling watched from every fucking corner of this place. Then, something he said pierced all my thoughts and flashed red lights in my mind.  
*""There's also been some people who claim to have heard Juan, an old slave who worked in these fields, grunt""*  
I almost hyperventilated. I stopped dead in my tracks and I asked him to make the sound that these people heard.  
The sound he made was *the exact same thing I had just heard*.  
I immediately let him know that I had just heard it, not even 20 feet into the trail, and off to the right. He smiled and kept on walking, while I just felt increasingly like running far away from this place.  
.  
As we walked farther into the darkness, we heard the story of the lovers who hung themselves on a tree that still stands. We heard about how this big field was home to a huge cemetery where you can still find old tombstones even though most of it is buried underneath the ground.  
We were told about how this land used to be part of a large Hacienda, which had slaves. It dates back to the 1770's and holds a lot of history and death. We reached the clearing with the ruins and we were lastly told about the legend of the woman who hops into your car if you drive by this area. But, we all just giggle at that one since that legend is basically on every dark street of America.  
.  
Our light-heartedness didn't last for very long. Right in front of the path towards the ruins, there was a car.  
No, not a car. It was the *remains* of a terribly *burned* car that was stripped for parts previously to being burnt.  
It was in horrible shape. Normally, we'd just ignore it and keep on going but it smelt horrible. It smelt like it had recently burnt but this wasn't the worse smell emanating from it.  
The closer to you got to it, the smell of *rotting flesh* smacked your senses. We tried to check for a body but we couldn't see much as the car was flipped over onto it's top. We looked around it for any clues, but we couldn't find anything. All we knew was that if you got near it, the smell was horrifying. We toyed with the idea of calling the Police for quite a while. The group was divided between wanting to call the Police and not wanting to call the Police and just go home.  
We just tried to ignore it for a bit and stood around, clearly rattled.  
.  
We tried to make the most of our outing before deciding what to do with the car. We faced a big issue. The grass was way too tall for us. We didn't feel safe walking into over 5' tall grass as we couldn't see anything and it would render us very vulnerable to any one who *may* be out there. As we were standing around, debating what to do, the grass directly in front of us began to move. The kind of swishy, swaying movement that happens when you walk through grass. There was *no* breeze and this was just one small patch *directly in front of us*.  
The eerie part is that it kept moving. It seemed to keep coming *towards* us until we flashed a light on it and it stopped.  
.  
B took out his EMF detector and began to *taunt* whatever was out there. I'm usually very against taunting these things, but B always does it. He likes to push everything to the limit. As he kept taunting, the grass would move and the EMF would go off the chart. It would go from green to hellfire red, over and over. Our pulses were racing. Then, suddenly, to our left from within the trees... a small girl's *giggle*. It was very loud and clear. We all turned towards it together and were very startled.  
This is the point where my boyfriend took his phone and began to record.  
I was taking pictures left and right but I wasn't capturing anything at all, aside from some dust spots. I wasn't even taking pictures for the sake of taking them, I was taking pictures to use the flash as light because I felt extremely watched.  
This is when C mentioned that she felt like something touched her back, and A mentioned he felt something, too.  
.  
We began to doubt if this was a good idea whatsoever, and we're barely starting to walk back in the direction of our cars when we heard it.  
It is a sound I will never forget. Imagine the sound of a woman being split open and having her guts pulled out one by one. It was a gurgled, deep guttural *scream*. *A long, drawn out scream.*  
If I had to guess, I'd say it lasted almost 2 full seconds and when you think about it, that's a long time for a scream.  
This is where I started to lose it. I was *not comfortable* at all anymore. I began to hyperventilate and this was caught on audio. As soon as the scream ends, all you can hear is my hyperventilating deep inwards breaths.  
That was pretty much my breaking point. I wanted to leave then and there but the guys insisted we stay a little longer.  
We walked around for a while, up and down the road, and I swear at one moment, I saw a face staring at me through the grass. It was very low on the ground, I'd say about 2 feet off the ground, peering up at us with a malicious look on it's face.  
After a while of no more happenings, we decided to leave and deal with the car.  
We headed over to the Police department and let them know what we found.  
They sent 2 patrols and they headed in, fully armed.  
We were never told what they found.  
.  

My boyfriend and I still have the recording but upon inspecting it, the scream is extremely low and the audio is very contaminated with ambient noise (also known as crickets), so we've been on the search for a free program that will allow us to fix it.  
So, please, if you know of how to fix it, let us know so we can upload it.  
We'd love to share it!

A couple weeks after my grandfather had passed, my dad had the strangest dream. It involved my grandfather holding my baby cousin's hand. They were both wearing swimwear and he said, ""I'm taking Asia (my baby cousin) to the pool, she's hot."", and that's all my dad remembers. We shrugged it off until my mother called and told us that the morning AFTER my dad had that dream, my cousin was rushed to the hospital with a fever of 104.

May just be a coincidence, but I prefer to believe it was my grandfather trying to warn us.

1374710196.0,29,self.Thetruthishere,1izqzc,Our friend Kurt [fam][me],alphabet-town,39,10,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1izqzc/our_friend_kurt_famme/,"Hello again friends, I've been meaning to tell this story for a while. It's still ongoing. Sorry for the wall of text.


A few years ago, when my sister Katy was in her final year of High School, she was going through tough times.
She would have very morbid dreams about suicide and sometimes she would hear people screaming her name in her head as she slept.
One early morning, she woke up and saw a man in her bedroom. He was sitting by her dresser and staring at the wall. She says she didn't feel afraid, she felt calm, even a little curious.
He never looked at her, he just stared at the wall. He was wearing blue jeans, ripped at the knee, with a baggy flannel shirt. He had scruffy brown hair and reminded her of someone who might've been a fan of Nirvana in the 90's. For this reason Katy and I have nicknamed him Kurt.
I'm just going to add that I am **NOT** saying that this is the ghost of Kurt Cobain. All I'm saying is, he looked sorta similar and so we gave him that nickname.


Katy sat up in bed and Kurt faded away. She saw him in her bedroom again a few months later.


Maybe in his life, Kurt had been a music lover. Because Katy and I started having little experiences after that.
The first one was when Katy was home alone watching TV, something strummed her guitar that was leaning against the wall. It made a distinct chord sound, something that to the best of my knowledge as a musician isn't possible without hands on the fretboard and strumming the strings.


In our living room, we have an old piano facing the wall. I play it regularly.
I often hear footsteps begin to walk as I'm playing. A few times when home alone I have thought ""Oh! Dad &amp; Katy must be home because I can hear their footsteps."" only for nobody to arrive.
I feel a presence as I play, sometimes it feels as though someone is standing behind me watching me play. Other times I hear the footsteps walk into the room and stop, as if the person has stopped to enjoy the music.
Katy has said there have been a couple of occasions she has heard the clinking of glasses an a man laughing and talking coming from our empty living room.
Again, normally I'm not frightened, more curious than anything. The presence doesn't feel threatening.


A few years have passed, with the occasional encounter.
Katy is now in therapy and is doing a lot better. The latest encounter with Kurt came a few weeks ago.
She was in her therapy session, talking to the therapist about her life. I'm not sure exactly how it came up, but she mentioned that she sometimes feels scared in our house (for many reasons, not specifically paranormal) . The therapist, without any encouragement from Katy said ""Do you think your house is haunted?""
Katy briefly mentioned her encounter with Kurt.
The therapist said, with a straight look on her face, ""Its funny you say that, because he's actually here."" Katy was shocked. The therapist continued, ""He's sitting right next to you, he's all dressed up wearing a suit.""
Katy was dumbfounded, a little frightened but fascinated at the same time.


I was also shocked when she relayed the story to me later and it still puzzles me when I think back on it. I thought therapists weren't supposed to believe in ghosts. Aren't they all about science? Wouldn't seeing apparitions be a sign of mental illness to a therapist?
At the very least I found it surprising she would discuss it with a client.
I think it gave Katy comfort that she wasn't crazy. The therapist wondered if maybe he was her guardian.


But the day wasn't over. Again, I can't be sure that this is actually relevant or even paranormal. But it is an interesting coincidence.
As Katy left the therapist's office that day, she began her walk home.
She was barely out the front gate when she started to feel faint, almost sleepy. Like she was going to pass out. There was a foreboding feeling and something inside telling her to not walk home and go back inside.
She shrugged it off, thinking she was just feeling overwhelmed from the therapy session and all this talk of ghosts.
She kept walking, that's when an unmarked van began to circle her slowly, the man inside staring at her with every circle. She was being followed.
She didn't go back to the therapist's office, instead she ran and hid in a nearby McDonalds where she called me and explained what happened.


There's no way to know for sure, but both of us wonder if the faint feeling she had was someone, maybe Kurt, warning her there was someone waiting to stalk her.


I'm sorry if this story is rambling, I'm just trying to piece together all the experiences we've had that might be related.
Both Katy and I are curious to know more about Kurt and his history but so far we have no luck.
The history of our house is clean for the last decade, before our parents bought the house in the late 80's it was my Father's Grandparents' house who lived there until they died.
Assuming Kurt really is from the 80s - 90s era, my family has lived there since then, so there's no history of murders or suicides or anything untoward. Obviously Katy interacts more with Kurt than I do, so I'm wondering if he is connected to her for some reason.
I'd like to get more answers one day.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1izqzc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1izqzc/our_friend_kurt_famme/,

Back when I was twelve I lived in this really small town in Ohio and my house had a lot of weird things that would go on. Doors would shut themselves, you could hear people whispering, and my dad and I both would see a cat walk through the glass doors in our florida room. It probably didn't help I lived about five minutes from a graveyard that had a huge mass grave of cholera victims. 

But anyways one night I was looking around my room for my remote which I usually leave on my pillow but for some reason that night it was gone and I couldn't find it anywhere. I checked my bed over a dozen times and even moved all the blankets and my pillows but still couldn't find it. After maybe fifteen minutes I gave up and just turned off my lights and ran to jump onto my bed. I was laying on my back looking up at the ceiling when out of nowhere my remote came at my face and landed right next to my head. All my brain could have time to process was my remote coming at me from the darkness of my ceiling. My blood ran cold and I jumped out of my bed so fast throwing the remote and I won't lie I was basically crying I was so terrified.

I tried so hard to write it off as totally not real but I just couldn't rationalize it. And then about two week later I had my friend C over spending the night and we were alone in the house other than my mother. So we're just sitting talking school and dumb stuff when my cell phone starts ringing and it's my home phone calling me. I think 'oh that's weird' but it's probably just my mother being lazy from across the house and I answer it and no one's on the other line it's just dead air. We walk out to my mothers room to see what she wants and she's asleep and now we get really creeped out. We wake her up and make her go find the home phone with us and it's now off the hook and sitting out on the couch face up still on the line.

It's safe to say I'm glad I no longer live there because it scared the hell out of me to be alone. This isn't the only stuff that happened but these are the two that to this day still give me goosebumps to think about.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1gvtbh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gvtbh/remote_thrown_from_my_ceiling_me/,

I used to get out of my bed and walk around downstairs and stuff, my parents always just guided me back to bed. I unlocked doors a few times and even headed down the street on one occasion. What gives me pause about this entire situation is that I haven't done anything like that in a really long time. My parents still think that I get up and walk around my room because they hear things in my bedroom, but they haven't actually seen me do it.

Now on to a story that has, quite frankly, freaked me out a bit. One night I was home from college and I was sleeping in my room. I remember having a weird dream. I was in a desert staring at a lone tree. I had an uneasy feeling which turned to dread. Like really quickly I was panicking about something but I didn't know what. In the moment I woke up, it felt as though the covers were ripped off of me. It took me a couple seconds to realize I was freezing. I then felt around my bed and realized I was freezing because there was absolutely nothing on the bed, I was sleeping straight on top of the mattress. I sleep in the pitch black dark and so I got up and had to feel my way to the light switch. When I turned on the lights, it looked like a bomb had gone off in my room. Things were scattered everywhere, including the linens from my bed. Two pillows were set against the door. One pillow was behind my television, and another pillow was inside my closet underneath a box. My comforter was draped over a chair and my sheets were on the other side of the room on the floor. The dresser drawers were all open, too. I quickly began picking everything up and putting it back on my bed. My father opened my door and said ""what the hell is going on in here?"" I just shrugged and told him I didn't know. He said it sounded like ""a damn warzone"" from downstairs. My mother came in the room too, because the commotion had woken her up as well. I guess we all convinced ourselves that I had gotten up in my sleep and destroyed my room. 
  
The next day, my father told me that he heard what sounded like people talking in my room and then the loud commotion. We started talking about it and that's when he told me he had been hearing things in my room for quite some time. Like the entire time I had been away at college, he heard with some regularity, noises coming from my room. He said sometimes it sounded like footsteps pacing, but other times it definitely sounded like people talking. He investigated a few times, but quit looking after never finding the source of the noise. Over the years, other people have told me the same thing, but I've always just ignored it. My sister-in-law got really really freaked out about it once. She was napping in the guest bedroom next to mine when she woke up and heard what sounded like someone stomping around my room. Again, I was away at college at the time and so she knew nobody was in there. Our dog was there with her and she ran out of the room and went downstairs when this started. Another thing, my dog won't come in my room. During the day, she likes to go in all the rooms and sleep on the beds (my parents let that dog do whatever she wants). But she never comes in my room, even when I try to get her in there.

Anyways, the common explanation for that night was me simply trashing my own room whilst asleep, but the circumstances around it have always creeped me out.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1ca0of,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1ca0of/me_im_either_sleepwalking_or_something_weird_is/,

The rain outside coupled with the creepy stories must have triggered it - had I recalled it sooner, I might have posted it sooner!

I was 20 I think, living on the fifth or sixth floor of an apartment building for students.  I had the outer bedroom in a corner apartment, so my wall space consisted of about 1/3 window, like a corner office.  

One evening it was particularly stormy. I was watching the lightning outside when I saw a bolt strike the apartment across from mine. Everything went dark as the power went out - I guess it hit a key power source or something.  With the power out, there wasn't any light to read and no power for the computer, so I just kept watching the storm.  At one point, the lightning flashed and I saw the silhouette of what looked like an upside-down person falling towards the rooftop of that same apartment; another flash and I saw another falling much farther away into the wooded park area that surrounded the complex.  I kind of paused, thinking my brain was trying to rationalize abstract images by making them into human-figures.  It was when a black shape seemed to fall down right by *my* window out of the corner of my eye that I shut the blinds and hopped into my bed on the other side of the room. I could think up logical excuses, but I was still freaked out.  A few days later I was still thinking about it on and off, but didn't find it especially troubling. 

It doesn't quite end though.  I went to my room a few days later and saw a shape standing in my room, right by the window where I had seen the black thing.  It looked like a human figure made out of the 'eye floaties' (those weird shapes you sometimes see that follow your eye movements), only it stayed still. Since it was day, I didn't feel afraid and approached it. It didn't move. In fact, once I got close, I didn't see it anymore, though when I stepped back I did.  I thought it was a bizarre trick of the light at this point (like a reflection) and sort of went about my business.

A few hours later I went out of my room to use the bathroom (I think this was the reason anyway) and when I came back, I saw the shape - which had been totally stationary up until this point - 'step' backwards.  My eyes went wide.  What the hell did I just see?  I was incredibly shy back then and didn't have any friends - none of us who shared the apartment even spoke to each other - so I always just kept it to myself.  It feels like reality trolled me or something, just because the 'experience' was so pointless.  Was it some sort of weird electronic phenomenon, I wonder?  Or maybe the stress from term papers was making me see things?   

Well, authentically supernatural or not, it was certainly bizarre.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_13kjad,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/13kjad/me_figures_falling_down_during_a_storm/,

I have been enjoying this subreddit and wanted to share my experience at the Copper Queen. It occurred about a year ago. My Ex-Wife and I were on a weekend trip and were staying at the Copper Queen (if you aren't familiar with the Hotel a quick google search will provide the paranormal background into the hotel). I will preface this story that we were both aware of the background and history of the hotel. That being said, the following actually happened. Two experiences happened to us during our stay. The first was as soon as we walked into our room it felt like the room was spinning around us. The sensation was so strong we both had to lie down on the bed. I played it off that it was the tacky, overly ornate wallpaper. After the experience we went about our day, including a ghost tour at night, which ended at the hotel. After the tour we hit the bar (at the hotel) for a few beers and some music and concluded our night. 

At about three a.m. I awoke from a deep sleep terrified. I shot up and put my hand on my wife’s face (not out of rudeness) because she was trying to tell me something. I was trying to get her to quiet down because I could distinctly hear laughter outside of our room. Not just any laughter, but children. It is hard to explain (I am a father of a three year old) but it just sounded like a young children laughing, giggling and having fun. After I gestured to have my wife be quiet I asked her if she heard it, she told me she could and that is why she was trying to wake me up.

That morning we checked out and at the hotel desk they have a large book to write down paranormal experiences. I had my wife record our encounter and out of curiosity I asked if any children were on that floor and we were told there weren’t. 

Obviously it is easy to dismiss. It could have been our minds playing tricks on us based off of what we knew or kids playing, but the entire experience just didn’t seem right. It is also difficult to imagine a parent allowing a child to play in a hotel at three in the morning.

The province has a metropolitan area that is just like any busy city, but there are rice fields, stretches of woodlands and densely-covered mountains.

When she was young and it was Holy Week or Halloween (I don't remember when she said this happened), people usually came together to visit their dead in the cemetery and then go home to feast and drink.

On one of these occasions, just as the sun set, my grandmother heard her mother start screaming and ordering all the children to run up to the 2nd floor. There's a living room there that has a big window, and it's where you get to all the other rooms upstairs.

So my grandmother did as she was told and so did all the other kids. The men started shouting and moving outside the house while the women ran up the stairs too.

Then, the kids were asked to sit together really closely while the women formed a circle around them and began praying loudly (the rosary, Catholic prayers).

When it was completely dark, my grandmother began to hear something thumping on the window and the roof. It was an old house with the 2nd floor completely made of wood so it was very easy to hear. There were scary screeches and the sound of something scratching and scrabbling on the window.

The women prayed louder and the thumping and scratching got more desperate, mixed in with some screeching. There was also another sound that my grandmother didn't realize until the height of it which was the flapping of a pair of great wings.

The noise outside and the nonstop chanting of prayers really terrified my grandmother but to add to that, her own mother took up a large knife (the ones used for cutting bushes out or killing livestock) and began running around the room, shouting and cursing, ""Get away from here you monster, you aren't taking any of the children!""

I don't remember if this all lasted until morning or just an hour or so. But afterwards, when my grandmother asked, her mother told her that an 'aswang' or local vampiric monster was spotted and was heading to their house.

She told me this story on a similar halloween/Holy Week night and it's made me afraid to sleep in our ancestral home ever again.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_120ek7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/120ek7/fam_when_my_grandmother_was_very_young/,

I'd been reading about the out-of-body experience for about a year, and had been attempting to induce it. I'd awakened a few times, on different occasions, with ""vibrations,"" which are a a sensation strongly associated with the beginning of an out-of-body experience. It basically feels like it sounds, as if you're body's vibrating, not terribly unlike a motor running. 

One morning, I'm having a lucid dream (something I do naturally when I sleep in) and, in a moment of reduced lucidity, I reach my arms through an outside wall of a building and pull myself through. As I go through, I have a strong eureka moment, as if I'd figured something out, but I would never remember what.

I woke up with vibrations and, still pretty frightened of the sensation in 2004, opened my eyes. I saw [this symbol](http://imgur.com/NXbiM) (just the blue) formed out of pale blue sparks, basically floating in the center of my field of vision. I had the notion at the time that it was a visible version of the vibration sensation (rhyming *and* alliteration!).

It seems like a strange thing for my mind to just make up out of nowhere, and I wonder if I've seen it before or something. Also, forgive the terrible quality of the image.

For me, the Shadow People always seem to be around before something bad happens. Kind of like a harbinger. For example, I will see one or two on a dark street corner and find out a horrible car crash happened in the same area that night. I do not think they cause the tragedies, but feed off the destruction in some way. As a disclaimer, I first discovered this theory when reading Dean Koontz’ Odd Thomas. It rang true for me, and after many observations and discussions with other sensitives, this theory seems pretty valid.

On to the experience!

On Thanksgiving of 2005, my professor invited my husband and I over for dinner. After stuffing ourselves, my professor suggested we walk off the meal in the desert area behind his neighborhood. It was dark, but our eyes adjusted quickly and we could see pretty well. We walked for a little while, not really paying attention to where we were. After an hour or so we decided to head back to the house. On our way back, I see the most Shadow People I have ever seen in the same place. Across the way was a large piece of desert that looked like it was going to be the site of a new development of houses. There were probably one to two dozen Shadow People just milling about in that area. I stiffened and my husband, who is familiar with my experiences, asks me what is wrong and I whisper (not wanting my professor and his family to hear) what I see. Needless to say, we picked up the pace. 

I spent the next three days glued to the news channel just waiting to hear what tragedy caused all of those Shadow People. Nothing. Nothing happens. I shrug it off eventually, even though I felt very uneasy about the whole thing.

Fast forward to 2009 and I watch a program on this:

1333656412.0,29,self.Thetruthishere,rv4zx,[Me][FAM] Some old experiences I posted on nosleep before I knew about this sub,,34,5,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/rv4zx/mefam_some_old_experiences_i_posted_on_nosleep/,"When I was around 5-7, I experienced one of the freakiest moments of my life. It was late at night (not sure of the exact time) and when I was supposed to be in bed, I was up secretly playing Super Nintendo. The sound was off since I could hear my mom and dad out in the living room talking and watching tv.

Now to help you guys visualize, my room is attached to the kitchen. Turn right, it leads to the dining room and living room. Turn left, and it leads to a utility room which is attached to the garage. There is a pool table in the garage.

So all of a sudden, I start to hear the sound of a pool game going on. Footsteps, the sound of chalk being rubbed on the pool cue, and the sound of the balls clacking, rolling across the table and going in the hole, everything. The thing is, I'm not hearing it from the garage. I'm hearing it as if it's happening in my room. It's as if every little detail of sound was amplified directly to my ears. I'm about to freak out when I hear my mom and dad rush into the kitchen and told them what I what I was hearing. My mom told me that they were hearing the same thing (amplified to them all the way in the living room). As we were talking, the sounds were still going on.

My dad had his shotgun and was making his way to the door that leads to the garage, with my mom a good 6 feet behind him and me directly behind her. He flung the door open (the garage light was already on, and we never left it on) and aimed his gun. I still remember that the second the door was opened, the sounds stopped abruptly. Nothing in the garage was moved, nothing out of place. All the equipment was in its place. Yeah, didn't sleep too easy that night.

The other story is about something my mom and my aunt experienced. My mom and my aunt used to spend time at their grandparents house often and stay over at night (especially during the summers). The house was way out in the sticks and very old.

My mom says that once when she was around 5 (the 70's btw) she rested her head on her pillow and thought she heard a muffled sound. So she turned her head and pressed her ear into it. And what she heard was the sounds of a party. She heard what sounded like a crowded party with so many people talking, it was a constant buzz of activity. Occasionally a mans voice would raise distinctly above the others. She heard glasses clinking (like people do for toasts) and women giggling. Everything was so real that she could visualize all of this in her head. She compares it to those fancy parties full of aristocrats that you see in movies from the 30's/40's. She remembers being more mesmerized than frightened and kept listening until she drifted off. She never told anyone but always remembered.

Now the pillow wasn't a sleeping pillow, but one for couches and she said it was really old and beautifully detailed. Which kinda conjures up the suggestion of it being in some sort of lounge or fancy home where parties like that would happen (thats what it reminds me of anyways).

Now fast forward a few years and her she was 10ish and her sister would be around 15. My aunt one night slept with that exact same pillow and heard the exact same things. Apparently she told my mom in the morning and my mom confessed that she heard the exact same thing years before. The thing is, they never heard those sounds again (and apparently they tried every time they slept over).

I still find that creepy. Anyways, I hope you guys enjoyed my stories.

1375024483.0,31,self.Thetruthishere,1j7ule,Two haunted houses [ME] [FAM],ZaLordsGuard,39,8,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1j7ule/two_haunted_houses_me_fam/,"Yesterday, I posted about a weird maybe fairy that I saw and mentioned in passing that I had grown up in a haunted house. Before I wrote this story down, I wanted to talk with my sibs to see if I'd missed anything. I spoke with them last night, and have permission to share their experiences with you. Just a note, neither of these ghosts were/are negative and these are not spooooooooky stories, although when things happened, it certainly was unsettling.

House 1: 
When I was ten, and my brother was five, we moved into a house in what used to be a mining town with a railroad. This is important because all of the houses were over a hundred and fifty years old, and most of them had been different things at different times. The house we moved into had a general store in it when it was built, and the proprietors lived upstairs. So there was a lot of foot traffic, as you can imagine. Despite being so old, we were only the third owners of the house, the previous owner had it for almost eighty years, and had passed it down. It was being sold because the last heir had gone into assisted living. When we bought the house, it was still filled with things; antique bottles, dented cans from the fifties, an old wheelchair. My mother is an amateur antique collector, and displayed everything she found.

Soon, we started to hear footsteps up and down the stairs. They would go from the hallway, down the stairs to the landing, and the into the kitchen. We'd hear this at least once a week, lather, rinse, repeat.
None of us were particularly hung up about this because we were renovating the house at the time, and my mother just thought that it was a former owner checking up on what we were doing.

And then he (heavy footsteps, we assumed male from the get-go) became a little more interested in US. My parents were a volatile couple, and it was lucky we had a guest room, because at least one weekend night a week, one of them would be sleeping in the guest room, stewing angrily. On those nights, Mr. M (we called him after the man who built the house) would PACE up and down the stairs. From the hallway, to the landing, to the guest room door, for an hour. He only did this when my parents fought.
He would mess with my radio, too - during a commercial break, the radio would move from the rock to the country station, so that when music started playing again, it would be George Strait, and not Nirvana. There would never be any kind of squealing or hissing, like you'd get when you turn the dial, either. On those occasions, I would turn the radio off and go downstairs. 
Mr. M could be helpful, too. In high school, I would wake up soon after my father had left for the day. I'd be up for an hour before anyone else got out of bed (high school primping and whatnot). On the occasions when I forgot to set my alarm, I would wake up to a knocking on my door. I'd get up, stumble to the door, and no one would be there, of course. But I'd be up on time. 
My sister saw him once, when she was very little (she said he looked like Pa Ingalls) and a friend from high school saw him (she described the same person, without knowing of my sisters experience) and never came back to my house. But we were never fearful of him, and when we moved, we were kind of sad to leave him.

House the second:

We moved when I was eighteen. I went to my first, typically crappy college apartment, and my family moved to a larger house in the same neighborhood. I have never lived in this house, but I stay there on occasion to pet-sit. Most of these experiences are not mine.

The minute my parents moved into this house, they knew something was hinky. They'd spent a year renovating (it's like they're just asking for a haunting, isn't it?) the house before they moved in, and they were both very aware of SOMETHING. So much so that they would state their intentions before coming in to do work, something like ""Hello, I'm just coming in to paint/fix the lights/put up drywall"". Before they'd moved in, my father was in my brother's room, on a ladder, painting. According to him, the whole house went dark as pitch, gradually, like the sun was passing behind the darkest cloud imaginable. He said he couldn't see a thing. And as soon as it got light again, he apologized, said he wasn't going to work any more that day, and hightailed it out of there.

He told everyone that before they moved in, and it seems that everyone kind of braced themselves. Hauntings were old hat at this point, but the darkness thing was creepy. So when they moved in, they asked their neighbors if they knew of anything weird going on in the house.
The neighbors all said the same thing, that there was a little girl who runs up and down the balcony (it is a second floor balcony adjecnt to the livingroom). The neighbors said she was there all the time, and it was only a matter of time before my parents saw her, too.
This little girl, she's about eight, blond, in (what else) a white dress. At the time my parents were moving in, my sister was eight and blond. So at first, my parents would think they'd see my sister sitting on the stairs, only to find her in her room. I don't mean to imply that this was a doppelgänger, only that in passing, they looked the same. Once in a while, they'd see the girl sitting on the staircase. They hear footsteps on the balcony all the time, along with high pitched giggles. My sister has since grown, and there is no mistaking the younger girl flitting around the house. My parents and siblings say that she's around all the time.
In fact, the man who brings the heating oil once told my father that (I'm paraphrasing) ""you know you've got a little ghost girl on the attic stairs? She stands there and looks at me whenever I go up"". This man wasn't scared, and he comes to the house at least twice a year, he just wanted my dad to know. 
In my own experience, I've not seen her, but I hear her. As I mentioned above, they've got pets and our great grandfather lives with them as well, so when my family goes away, I come down and stay. I've seen the dog start to greet something I can't see, followed by a little giggle, as if to say ""you're so silly, dog"". 
Lastly, people in the neighborhood will stop my parents when they are outside and ask if they've seen the little girl. 
No one is afraid of the house (except for that creeptastic shadow thing of Dads) and my family just takes it in stride ""yes, we live here, and we have a ghost girl"". Being open to the supernatural, I don't know if they attract things necessarily, or this is just par for the course if you live in an old neighborhood. But for now, no one has investigated the house because they still live there, and if something gets stirred up, they'd still have to live with it. My mother has done some research on the house, but hasn't found much, although when we bought the house, we found a filing cabinet full of Masonic ledgers with meeting minutes in them. Not relevant, but I thought that was neat. :)

1374493209.0,28,self.Thetruthishere,1it1gj,[Me] [Fam] My haunted house.,w0lfi3,37,9,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1it1gj/me_fam_my_haunted_house/,"You may have seen a few of my family anecdotes [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1irf5k/me_fam_three_generations_of_unusual_encounters/), and now, as promised, I'm typing up my account of the scariest house I ever lived in. 

I lived in Longridge at the time, a small town/large village in semi-rural Lancashire. At the time, I moved quite a lot, and I only lived in this house from being 16 to nearly 18. The cottage I lived in was very old: I don't have an exact date, but it was hundreds of years. I lived here with my mother, who, if you've read my previous post, is quite the skeptic.

We moved into that house in October 2008 (I think), but nothing scarier than scuffling noises and the occasional feeling of not being alone in the house occurred until the the winter of 2009/spring 2010. My friends and I had all developed a weird sense of discomfort in relation to one particular window in the dining room, which was visible from the living room and led out into our back garden. I would actively avoid sitting somewhere I could see the window at night, and one night in November a friend and I were watching television when we saw not a face, but a white mist that *suggested* a face, if that makes any sense, at this window. 
We tried to reason that it was a cat, the reflection of something white, the moon, condensation (there are a lot of reasonable explanations) but we couldn't shake this utter feeling of terror. We both became quite hysterical and had to telephone our friend to drive over from the next village to turn the dining room light on as we were too scared to. I didn't go home until the morning.

In this house, the back garden (that this window looked out on) was completely enclosed and could only be accessed through the house. A modern extension was built on to the old house, about half the width of the original building, making the overall house kind of an L shape, with the newer bit leading into the garden. My bedroom was at the back of the old house, directly above where the front door of the original house (now the window discussed above) was. For about five months, every morning at 6:03 exactly I was woken up by knocking, that I assumed to be at our front door.

Having gone downstairs and found nobody at this door (or going into the front bedroom and looking down if I felt scared!) quite a few times, I concluded that I was imagining it, especially as my mother never heard it. It continued, however, and I soon realised that the knocking wasn't at the front door, but at the window beneath my room. I never saw anyone down there, though.

Other things I experienced in this house included hearing music from ipods, ipod speakers, laptops etc, only to find them switched off when I went to turn them off, and once, terrifyingly, seeing a male face on the television, only to look again and see that it was off. I was too frightened to tell my mother about any of this in the house, as I had a feeling that whatever was there would hear me. I was terrified and stressed, I felt like I was losing my mind. When I heard my mother wanted to move closer into to town, I was really happy, but the odd noises, knocking, electronic weirdness seemed to double once we'd decided to leave. 

Just before my 18th birthday, we finally moved, and my mum and I were sitting in a nice country pub having some lunch. We were chatting about how the new house wasn't as pretty as the old one, but that we liked being nearer to work/college/family... when my mum asked me to tell her what it was I had wanted to tell her but couldn't when we lived in the cottage. When I told her about everything - the electronics, the window, my strong feeling that there was something awful in the house, she looked weirded out and proceeded to tell me something that, from her own admission, she wouldn't when we lived there as she knew that I would never go back inside if she did.

My mother, a logical woman who maintains, after quite a few experiences, that she doesn't believe in ghosts, was also terrified without real reason of that window. Shortly before we decided to move, she was sitting alone at night and saw a man through the window. Remember that our garden was enclosed and that the man was standing where I heard the knocking and where the old front door was.

He was wearing a flat cap and waistcoat - clothing that in Lancashire is very traditional and could basically come from any era. He was walking towards the modern extension, and my mum sprang up to confront him, as she thought he was trying to enter the house. When she got there, he was gone and there was nobody in the garden. I know this is speculation, but I don't think he was aware of the newer bit of the house and still operates on the old boundaries.

Anyway, sorry this was so long! It was one of the scariest periods of my life and is something that I love to share with people.

As such, I was well accustomed to old buildings, antiques, and so forth. I personally had the pleasure to grow up in a brick Edwardian farmhouse built in 1901. It used to be part of a working farm, but by the time my parents purchased a parcel of the land that included the house, the barns and the house to a degree had fallen to disarray. My father bought it as a 'fixer-upper' project and for the last 20 years has been slowly restoring the house (we were a poor family). 

We moved in to the house when I was a year and a half. I have vague recollections of the house's original format pre-renovation. The house and its outdated oddities had always fascinated me. I couldn't say when the odd things began to happen for me, just that some point between 2 and 6 I was experiencing bizarre things. I like to think that children have overactive imaginations, and I hold to the idea that I still do. However, somethings can't always be easily explained away. 

I vividly recall, at an early age, being awoken and terrified, because my bed was shaking. Something had begun to shake my bed and only my bed moved. I remember building the courage to dash to the hallway and my parents room next door. I remember my cat watching from the doorway, concerned. I remember how my room appeared in the glow of my nightlight. But most of all I remember launching myself from my bed, to my parents room, who promptly told me to go back to bed, and that my cat Scrappy would protect me. When I returned to my room, terrified to linger in the hall, the room was still. I want to point out that I lived on a back gravel road. Heavy trucks are rare and it wasn't winter (so it wasn't a snow plough). At best it could have been an earth quake. 

Around this time I used to be awoken some mornings by a voice calling my name. Maybe it was a dream. But I vividly recall a voice calling my name from the driveway in the early morning beneath my window. I'd be awoken by it. At that point my bed was beside the window, and I would pull back the curtains, look below, and each time a man would look back up at me. He was old timey looking, in a brown coarse suit and a fedora. He looked like a vacuum cleaner salesmen. And he stood beside a yellow taxi cab, one of the older ones from New York City. He'd stand beside his taxi and call my name, begging me to come down. 

He terrified me. I would hide under my blanket until he went away. Maybe he was a recurring nightmare. Maybe he was the product of my imagination. I don't really know. But there was something about his smile, that fake smile that terrified me. As an adult I would discover a description of a smile by Stephen King which would fit him perfectly. A smile like steak knives. 

I have plenty more where this came from, but I'll start off by hopefully whetting a few appetites.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1dee05,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1dee05/me_encounters_from_my_family_home/,

I also know that I said I was going to make another post a few nights ago, but strange things have started happening and my focus has been more on analyzing them. But until I have more to say about them besides 'bumps in the night' I'm going to hold off. I promise I will get into them at a later point, especially if they keep waking me up.

When I was 19, already been in the military for just under a year (this is relevant to a point I want to make later), I was home visiting in the summer. A friend and I were camping out in a branch of the Canadian river where all the locals go mudding and rock crawling. My friend, I'll call him 'M' for this story, was smoking trees and I had just opened my second beer and we were waiting on two more of our friends to come out. It was an incredibly pleasant night for camping, perfect weather, clear sky. It was about an hour after sundown and we had just got our camp set up and were chilling listening to music. Procrastination at it's best. Our campsite was literally /our/ campsite. It was far back in the more difficult to reach area where you either need to hike for miles or have a serious off-road capable vehicle. It's at the base of a train bridge that spans about 500ft, with the bridge being about 100ft above the river bottom and sheer cliffs on either side. 

Many times we would be camping and trains would go across at night, the conductors would wave flashlights out as a little 'hello' when they see our fire and we would wave back. Because of the age of the bridge, or just their SOP I'm not sure, they would always slow down before traversing so it's usually at a crawl. This night we happened to look up and see bright lights over the rim of the cliff. Thinking it was just a train we waited and watched until the train crested over the rim. That was when I noticed that the bright lights over the rim didn't progress along with the front engine when we actually saw the train. The front car had it's own lights but the night sky was still lit up like there was still a train coming. Like I said, normally the conductors would wave and honk their horns but this one was silent, even when we shined our lights up at them. Then I saw it, hovering above the train and moving at a slower pace was a something that took my breath away. If I had to guess it was about 15ft above the train and had all kinds of lights onboard. We both stood there and stared at it until it was about perpendicular to us, then it stopped. 'M' started walking towards it with a look on his face that could only be described as wonder, kind of like the look on Apu's face in Aladdin when they first go into the cave of wonder. When he got closer to the bridge it slid to the opposite side, until he got under the bridge then it slid back towards me. When 'M' saw that he couldn't see anything he started to come back and it slid back over the train, which was still moving btw. After he got back to where I was standing a spotlight came down from the craft onto us, the light was so intense I could feel heat from it. And this was from at least 100ft. I remember falling to my knees and being unable to look away. I also couldn't breathe properly as soon as the light turned on us, like that feeling that you get if you're about to pass out from oxygen deprivation, but I didn't pass out. 

I don't remember if 'M' had the same experience because all I could see was the light. Then the spotlight turned off and the craft started moving along with the train again. About 3/4 of the way across the bridge the craft veered off and climbed at a crazy speed until we couldn't see it any more. After the thing disappeared it took quite a few minutes for me to get my mind right again. The phrase 'we've been chosen to tell everyone' kept repeating in my head for some reason. Naturally one doesn't go and plan on telling people anything along those lines unless you want to be branded as a crazy. 'M' and I had no explanation for what happened so the following conversation didn't progress past ""did you see that dude?"" I told him what I was thinking, about the whole tell everyone part, and he would only shake his head. We both knew it was a bad idea, so until tonight I haven't mentioned it to anyone. Another thing we noticed was that the portable stereo we were listening to somehow lost all power sometime during the event, the batteries in it were dead along with the extras we brought with us. The clock in his truck also reset and the battery had to be jumped the next morning. It didn't have enough power left to turn over, only to barely run the electronics.

The size of it would only have been similar to a Chinook, except that there was no sound. I've been around and in shit-hooks and they are so ridiculously loud that you need hearing protection or you'll get permanent hearing loss. It's acceleration was also greater than that of any helicopter I'm aware of, especially one of that size.

I'm fairly new to this subreddit and I've been lurking on all these fabulous stories quite a bit. I figured it was time to share one of my own. Let me start out by saying this story is true, although I frequently find myself wishing it wasn't. It's been a few years now, so forgive me if the details are a bit blurry.

I was seventeen, maybe eighteen. Either in my last semester of my senior year of high school, or freshly into the excitement that is the summer after graduation. Regardless, I was with my boyfriend of two years. We were driving a route we commoned that was between my parents' house and his. I was driving the little five-speed '93 toyota tercel that I had at the time, and we were driving down the 'speedtrap hill' that was famous at my high school. At the bottom of the hill was a rather large pond that some of my naughtier friends and I used to smoke weed at pretty regularily. Across the street from the pond was a half built, deserted luxury subdivision called 'the shire.' It was all lord of the rings themed, and it was a common 'meet up' place for friends. ANYWAY, on this particular night (it was probably around 12am) my boyfriend and I were driving down the hill and all of a sudden I saw a light up ahead, in the woods by the side of the road. It wasn't just a light though, it was moving. I at first attributed it to being tired, but as we got closer the figure got more defined. It looked like a small deer, or maybe a large dog, and it was glowing white. It moved across the street, but not in a way that I've ever seen an animal move before. It sort of galloped, or bucked. The only way I can describe it is, when I was seven I witnessed a baby bunny eat poisoned grass and die of a seizure. That's exactly what the glowing deer animal was doing. It flopped and seized into the street, all the while still glowing. (Mind you, there are no street lights in this area at all) After it reached the middle of the street, it retreated, flopping back into the woods. I cannot describe the utter terror and foreboding I felt the second this 'thing' appeared. It looked like it was in terrible pain and it was definitely not living. After it left my boyfriend and I sat in silence until he said 'Please tell me you saw that, alison.'

I have avoided that route ever since, and I still have dreams about that creature. I will never know what it was and every logical explination I can think of just doesn't make sense.

1356701887.0,29,self.Thetruthishere,15klf7,[FAM][FR] An interesting story that was told to me once... and then again by someone else.,anhero23,36,7,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/15klf7/famfr_an_interesting_story_that_was_told_to_me/,"My dad had told me of the time he had seen a UFO. He was 9 and during his stay at summer camp, he (and two others) decided to look for satellites in the night sky. After a while, they apparently witnessed a speck of light zip across the sky in a zig zag pattern. During the time he first told me this story, I was pretty skeptical. I thought it was just something he had tricked himself into believing when he was 9.

Fast forward half a decade. I'm hanging out at a friends house (I'm sleeping over so we decide to share ""spooky""/interesting stories) and my dad's ""encounter"" comes up in conversation. This is when my friend remarks that my dad's encounter sounds exactly like his dad's encounter. My friend then precedes to describe an experience that his dad had: as a 12 year old, my friend's dad saw a light zig zag across the night sky. This was in the summer and my friend's dad is exactly 3 years older than mine.

They saw the same phenomenon in the same year. I had never spoken to my friend about this before and his dad was there so he could confirm the story immediately.

As a science enthusiast (and physics major), I absolutely hate it when people try to support ""interesting"" claims with anecdotes and hearsay... but dammit! I've got exactly that type of experience in my head and I can never prove it. It can never mean anything to anyone except myself. I know that if I tried to talk to my fellow science peers about this, they would laugh me out of the room.

I don't know what eats at me more: trying to figure out the physics that would allow for a craft to zig zag (which should be fucking impossible) or coming to terms with the fact that I have a thought in my head that isn't too far off from what Mulder has in the X-Files.

Our room was the first door on the left after exiting the stairs. The dorm room was rather spacious with a bedroom separated from our common room followed by the bathroom. Even though there was 3 of us, it was easy to have some privacy if one of us needed to study, read or take a nap. Although, if we really needed to hit the books we would go down to the study room located in the basement.

The study room always had a heavy feeling, but we always attributed it to that musty smell associated with old buildings. I spent a decent amount of time in that room and most of that time was alone. I would frequently look up expecting someone to be standing in the doorway or sitting at a table. It felt like someone else was in the room and it was very distracting. That was the only thing that ever happened down in that room. At least to me.

After only a month of living together, we started hearing strange sounds coming from what ever room we weren’t in. The bathroom door would move and make that little creaking noise, hangers would clank in the bedroom, the shower curtain would rattle. However, we never actually saw anything happen. It was only ever noises. We did have a fan in the bedroom, but we would only ever turn it on at night. We only ever heard sounds while we were awake. Chalk it up to people in other rooms making the noises or leaving a window open, but the walls were thick and I will be damned if the wind was moving things. The three of us know what it was. 

We had a couch and three desks in our common room, plenty of room for people to hang out. There was a girl from down the hall that spent a lot of time in our room (she married one of my roommates) and she was the first person to put a name to the sounds. The four of us were sitting in the common room, TV was off, no music, just silently doing our homework. From the bedroom it sounded like someone had just flopped onto the bed. We looked at each other, assuming one of us had disappeared into the bedroom. After seeing that the three of us were still in the room, we decided to check it out. Nothing. The girl looked up at us and said, “Must be Fred the friendly ghost”.

From that point on whenever we heard a sound, we would look up with a questioning look and say “Fred, is that you again?” We called it a prankster and never once felt scared or threatened. Well, except for one instance.

We were coming back from dinner on south campus. As it was a long walk down there, we went in a group of 5 or 6 people. Everyone was going back to our room to watch a movie for the night. We hit the stairs and walked into the hallway. I grabbed my key and started to reach for the deadbolt when we all hear *Click*. I stopped dead in my tracks, key just hovering a few inches away from the lock. We all looked at each other, a few people confused at why I had stopped. My roommate jiggled the handle, expecting the door to open, but it was still locked. My other roommate knocked on the door, looked at us and said “Who the hell is in our room?” We could clearly hear someone walking around in the room, but no one was responding.

I mustered as much courage as I could and unlocked the door. As I turned the key, the lock made the same *click* that we heard earlier. My strongest roommate went first, he stormed into the room, I flicked on the lights and we quickly scouted the room. After discovering that no one was there, we realized it must have been Fred. For the rest of the night we joked about Fred and let him know he pulled a good one on us.

At the end of the year we learned that the hall was built some 40 years ago and the year it was built a student killed himself down in the study room. Needless to say, I never went down to that room again. The girl swears that ‘Fred the friendly ghost’ followed her to her next apartment and continued to pull pranks on her. I never experienced anything that felt like that ever again.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1562e6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1562e6/me_fr_fred_the_friendly_ghost/,

 As you all know, that means aliens.

I am 14 years old. Freshman in high school. It was a Saturday night and my friend and I were staying up late,we had just had a tropical storm happen the day before so power was out, it was the middle of June,we were hot as hell. We decided to lay out on her roof {which is very flat} and stargaze. Gosh, there were so many stars out that night. As we were staring into those billions of stars, it seemed like something wasn't right.... like something bad was going to happen. We noticed that the ""stars"" were moving. In a circle.Not your average twinkles. They were fucking moving in a 'filled-in' circle. Two of the ""stars"" started dropping down at astounding speed. We both thought that we were just tired and seeing things. Nope, they began to how you say.., 'hover' about 20 meters in the sky when we realized shit just got real. No, we weren't dreaming. I said ""Alexis, get you mother fucking ass up and get inside, NOW. "" We start booking it inside. we slip,or so we think we did. We pass out... wake up the next morning laying on the floor, in 2 corners. Her over there, me over here. She says ""Camryn, did I cut, my leg last night?"" I said I don't remember... I check out her left thigh, and I'll be damned, she had a small (about 8 cm) cut or incision- rather on her leg. she says Camryn, check yours. I check mine... in the same fucking place there lies a 8 cm cut on my thigh. We flip shit. She says ""I do remember a bright light last night..."" I never go outside at night in fear of that happening again. I've never told this to anyone and neither has she. Thank you for reading my story.

I Got Two Visits.,aelizabeth27,39,6,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1058ku/grandma_visits_the_family_after_death_me_i_got/,"*I was inspired to write about my grandmother after reading a similar story: [Sargwa's Story](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/zytvk/me_the_night_my_grandma_died/).*

I apologize in advance if some of this seems clunky. I am re-telling individual accounts. 

My grandmother loved all of her family, but she had a special bond with some of the girls. She lavished attention upon us, and we absolutely adored her.

Unfortunately, we lost her in 2000 to lymphoma that had been mis-diagnosed and not caught until five days before her death. We all crowded around the hospice bed in her living room to be near her in her final hours. When she finally passed, it was as if our collective hearts broke as one. While the males in the family grieved for her as well, us ladies were almost beside ourselves. 

Not so very long after she died, each of the girls had an individual experience with her. These stories came to light a few years after her death when we all met up for a girls weekend by the bay. I have changed family members names for obvious reasons.

**Martha(aunt):** Martha had the worst flu of her life. She was in bed with a fever that flirted dangerous levels, and had body aches so severe that getting to the bathroom was a chore. She at one point began speaking to her mother (in the way that people speak to air when they miss someone), telling her how much she missed her, and how she didn't know if she could manage without her. She cried herself to sleep. 

A while later, she awoke to what she said was the sound of whispering near her bed. She rolled over, and in the mirrored doors of her closet, she saw my grandmother. Behind her were men that looked to be darker-skinned (she couldn't tell what ethnicity they were). My grandmother smiled at her, and my aunt said it was like she heard her voice inside of her head. ""Let me go, darlin'. My daughter is strong. She will always find a way."" My aunt said she felt warm, like someone had put a blanket fresh out of the dryer on her. My grandmother disappeared after that. No glimmer, no fading, just gone.  
____________________


**Helen(cousin):** Helen is a person who is open to all sorts of experiences and possibilities, so when her friend asked her to go to a psychic, she agreed. Helen got pregnant not so very long after our grandmother died, but was not far enough along to even have the slightest of belly yet. When the psychic began to speak to her, Helen said she looked at her in a very odd way. She then said, ""Your grandmother misses you so much. Your baby is a girl, you know this yet? It is your grandmother... her soul. She's coming to watch over you and keep you safe."" This woman did not know that our grandmother was dead, or that Helen had a particularly close bond with her. Not to mention that she was pregnant with a child that turned out to be a girl. When her daughter got older, she looked more and more like our grandmother, and even had some strangely-similar mannerisms. 
___________________


**Me:** I had two experiences with my grandmother. She and I had been very close. My mom worked full-time, and my dad was a loser who didn't care about his children. As such, I was with my grandmother A LOT. I was thirteen when she died, and it was my first experience with death. It absolutely devastated me, and I had no idea how to cope with such a thing. I was suffering from horrible nightmares (an egg timer set for 30 minutes, a variety of medications in front of me- find the right combination and I save grandma. Fail, and she dies. Every time, I failed. Every time, right before the timer went off, she would look at me and say, ""Why didn't you save me?"" The timer would buzz, then I'd have to watch her die again). I was horribly broken. 


I was in the hospital. I was violently ill, and in and out of consciousness (semi-consciousness is more accurate). Even when conscious, I never opened my eyes, but I could hear everyone talking. I could hear my mother muttering to my step-father about how my father was a bastard for not coming to the hospital. I could hear the doctor talking to them. Suddenly, a cool, soft hand was put on my forehead. I felt soothed and at ease instantly. A voice that sounded familiar said, ""Shhh, you rest now. You're going to be better so soon, little flower. "" The hand was gone. I remember getting the sudden realization in my feverish mind that my grandmother said that to me when I was sick on her couch as a child. The voice was my grandmother's. My mother said that all though my eyes never opened, I yelled, ""Come back!"" a few times until I just whimpered and then got quiet again.


The second experience was when I was reading a book one day. All of a sudden, I got a VERY clear image of my grandmother in my head, sitting at the counter in her house with a cup of tea. She said, ""Don't you remember going to my funeral? I'm dead. You've got to let me go honey. You can't fuss over me anymore."" Could it have been a dream? Possibly. However, I have no recollection of dozing off or waking up. 
________________

For those of you who are skeptics, each of the stories could be explained a variety of ways- greif, illnesses, coincidence. However, I am a pretty logic-based individual, and I still can't quite get behind those explanations. Since then I have had to bury friends and family members more times than I can count on both hands, and I have never had an experience like the ones I had with my grandmother.

This happened to me just over two years ago. I was walking back from a friend's house after having a few drinks and as soon as I got onto my Dad's street I saw the two lights shown in the video hovering still in the sky. As it was my birthday, I was carrying my camera with me so I whipped it out and began recording. Once they flew over my Dad's house I tried looking out my window to see them but they had disappeared.

Any idea as to what they are/could be?

**Some information about the video:**

* The long purple glare coming down from the lamppost is just something my camera sometimes picks up when directly looking at light.

* At 0:33 you will notice that both of the *things* flicker. This is because they are going past a television aerial on the top of my Dad's roof.

**Initial post**


I take night classes at a community college, which is about five miles away from home.  I usually take the bus, but last night, I got preoccupied asking my professor some questions about the lecture and missed the last bus.  I called some people if they could give me a ride, but they were all busy, so I just decided to walk home.  I don't know the exact time, but I probably left campus around 10:30 PM.


The area is the part of the city where the suburbs meet rural areas, so I walked through some dirt roads , only lit by the moonlight, to minimize my walking distance.  I was talking with my cousin on my phone to keep me company, but almost an hour in the walk, my phone died.  So I just walked alone in the dark of the night and the silence of winter.


I then arrived at an abandoned farm.  Not sure why it was abandoned, I just happened to pass by it every so often.  I decided that cutting through it would significantly drop my walking distance, so I climbed over the wooden fence and starting making my way through.


About a quarter into the farmland, I notice my left hand started to feel colder.  Then, it felt as if something was holding my hand.  I stopped walking instantly and pulled my hands together, warming my left hand with my right.  In my head, I continually repeated,"" what the fuck?""  I continued standing for about a minute of two, getting my composure back.  I gave out a long sigh and continued walking with my hands in my pockets.  However, within seconds, I started to feel like there was someone following me from behind, staring at me.  I didn't look back.


Now halfway through the farm, I start to hear a faint sound of a girl crying from behind me.  A moment of terror, but I tried to think reasonably.  ""Maybe it's just coming from a house near the farm.""  I calm myself as I continued walking, but the presence behind me was still there.


I was now passing the farmhouse, which is falling apart.  It looked really creepy in the dim moonlight, so I started to walk faster.  After I passed the house, the girl's crying ceased.  A moment of relief and complete silence.  Then out of no where, a loud shriek from the same voice came from behind.  I jumped from shock and pulled my hands out of my pocket without thinking, and at that moment, I felt the same cold feeling grasp my left hand again.  I turn around and see a small, dark silhouette standing right there.  I completely lost it, screamed in horror, and made a run for it.  I jumped the wooden fence on the other side, and ran until I couldn't run anymore.  (I'm overweight, so it's not that far.)


While catching my breath, I noticed that I dropped my backpack somewhere.  Regretting that I didn't put on both straps, I start to walk back the way I ran.  To my dismay, I couldn't find it anywhere and I walked all the way back to the fence to the abandoned farm.  At this point, I fall to my knees, finding out that I probably dropped my backpack in the farm.  I absolutely didn't want to go back there at the time, so I trudged all the way home.


Late the next morning, I biked to the farm with a friend of mine to find my backpack.  We hopped over the fence and found it halfway between the fence and the house.  My bag was open, but nothing was taken.  I'm not sure what conclusion I can make out of this one.  Maybe someone happened to look through my stuff, or that dark figure did.


**Update Post**


People wanted pictures, so after gathering up some courage, I payed another visit, during the day, with a friend.  I only took pictures of the house, since that's around the place where the climax of my story happened.


The album is [here](http://imgur.com/a/Bfadr#R1u6M).  (The last picture in the album is supposed to be the first.  My bad)


Sorry that I didn't show any proof, like me holding up a sign that says ""hi, reddit.""  It didn't come to mind until after we the farm.


Seeing that there was evidence of people coming to the house in the past, I felt more relaxed that this place wasn't unvisited.  One thing I want to ask is about the plant on the front door.  What is that?  I didn't want to touch it and I didn't bother taking a closer picture at the time. (sorry)  Is there any significance of it being placed on the door knob?  It's creepy because it wasn't there, or at least I think it wasn't, when I was there last time.


I also recorded a video of my friend and I visiting.  I wasn't thinking of uploading it, but something happened in it that I want explained, if possible.


The video took place before the pictures, and entering from the front.  The pictures are us going through the house again from the back.  The video handling quality is poor and my friend talks and cusses a lot.  It makes him less anxious.  I recommend watching it in high quality, to see in the darker rooms.


The video is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuS51cDkGxE).


Here's the part that I want explained.  What the heck is that crackling and rattling sound?  It progressively gets more frequent as we continue going into the house and it gets the loudest when I look at the right corner of the back room.  I filmed myself again walking around my house and watched it, only to find that the crackling didn't appear.  Does Nosleep have any explanations?


As far as I know, a man, woman, and daughter lived on the farm and they suddenly left. They were soft-spoken and rarely conversed with their neighbors. I got this information from a person who owns another farm close to it. His father knew them, but he himself didn't. He only knew them through his father. His father passed away, so I was only able to get any info he knew. Other farm owners around the area arrived after it was abandoned.


I'm really no sure where else I can get information on the farm.


**Current update**

The last I past by the farm was last winter holiday.  The whole farm is completely gone.  The house demolished, weeds gone, and land flattened.  I have no idea what the construction plans are, but in the end, I can’t visit this place anymore.  On the bright side, I’m glad I took a picture of the Marilyn Monroe graffiti.  If I’m going to take anything positive out of this, it’s that.

Now currently she lives in another part of the country, by a large distance. This is important to understand the significance of what happened next. She was home in a snowstorm, her lights were flickering, radio playing up, the usual stuff. The strange thing was... every time her room light flickered, literally the same second mine would do the same. Every other light in my house was fine, and the weather was calm. I don't have a clue how to explain that, different part of the country, no storm, and the rest of my house was fine, why was it happening? I'd soon find out, since things escalated quickly when I came off the computer around 20 past midnight to go to sleep. By this point the others in my house were asleep.

After I came off the PC I went downstairs, first of all halfway down our stairs we have a little landing with a window on it, I saw a ball of yellow light hover in front of it for a moment then zip off, kinda shook me but attributed it to me being jumpy after discussing the strange flickering, carried on, got stuff ready, then went to the toilet, as I was in there, I heard a slam from outside the bathroom, so, might still be me being jumpy, but I told it to get out anyway to be sure. But then... but then, I made the terrible mistake of taking a smoke.... that's when it happened. My god. I was stood there just in my doorway, and this wind that shouldn't have been suddenly swept up right in front of the door, it was like a windstorm pointed at me, I could literally feel it buffetting me while I was stood there. So you're thinking, just wind, right? Nope, we have a ton of windchimes and stuff on our yard that would have been making a racket, they were silent, the wind was in one spot, right in front of the door. And it was more than just that, the emotion coming off it was pure malevolence, it wasn't happy. I've read stories about people saying stuff like that, but never really understood it til that moment, it's like when someone is walking toward you with a knife pulled. So I'm trying to rationalise it all in my head, but then I heard the most unnatural growl you could ever hear. I'm not talking like a dog, I honestly couldn't describe it, it was far more menacing than any animal or reptile native to England. But me being me, I was STILL trying to rationalise this, put it down to nerves etc. Then I heard it again, louder, and accompanying it was the turning on of the light on our yard. The movement sensor light, that only turns on if something moves in the first few paces of our yard beyond the door. Bear in mind I'm stood as still as a statue in my doorway, so it certainly wasn't me. I put out my cig at world record pace, slammed the door shut and locked it and legged it to bed. Oh, and the whole time I felt far colder than I had all night.

It's the next morning now, I'm at work, safe and sound, posting this quickly before I get started. Nothing too strange happened this morning except a little lantern we keep over the fireplace on a chain decided to go swinging of it's own accord, I'm still trying to put that one down to me running downstairs after grabbing my key but I honestly don't know if that would've been anything close to enough to cause it. It wouldn't be the first time something has started swinging without any outside influence in my house.

I have a few ideas over what could have caused it, but I've actually ruled out the rational ones I can think of, since I always try to do so first. I'm just hoping it's not related to me attempting to advise someone on a haunting in their home that's causing them significant grief. I really don't want an angry spirit coming after me for meddling.

UPDATE: First of all, I didn't tell anyone else in the house about this event, there's literally no way they could have known. But I was told last night by someone I live with that at some point when the house was empty, while everyone was at work, that both boxes of bottles and cans we keep on the yard ready to put out for recycling (they're damn heavy), were both at the other side of where they'd been put, upturned and with bottles all around them. We've lived here for several years, and always put them in the same place, protected from the wind, and yet they ended up like this for the first time ever, the day after. I don't think it's coincidence, it couldn't have been the wind, since they would have needed to be pushed with a hell of a force from the direction of the wall they're sat against. I don't think whatever it was is happy I told it to leave.

What are your thoughts on past life regression?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_life_regression
(tl;dr: utilizing hypnosis to recover memories of past lives or incarnations, though others regard them as fantasies or delusions.)

I've had it done once. It was extremely vivid and rather scary. I was still skeptical until I saw my father receive regression and it made him weep for 5 minutes. He's serious and a non-believer and it is the second time I've ever seen him cry (first being my grandmother's death).

To seal the deal, a little girl, about 6, got it done. She was describing household items. Many of the items were objects we'd never heard about. We researched them as she talked about it which made us conclude she must be in 1830s America, the South.

This happened so quickly that there's never been a lot to tell.

A little back story: I was currently employed as a canvasser (UGH) for ADT. This was ~3 years ago. I was 19. Living in the Bay Area, we had a lot of different places we could work. My team decided (we had a car full of people) to take a mini vacation, driving out to Half Moon Bay, knock some doors and go to the beach. It was an awesome trip, especially since I grew up there. I have a lot of memories driving through windy 92 through the coastal range to Hayward and the likes when I was younger.

So, particular story this takes place on Highway 92 in California, on our way back to the bridge. We were driving down the windy ass road (downhill) through the dense coastal pine forest. If you've driven this road, you should know what I'm talking about. 

For those who don't and for reference, I found the exact turn on that road where this happened:
http://imgur.com/jimcTMC

When you expand that image you can see where the road curves out of view.

We had left after a late dinner. It was October or November so it had gotten dark early. I want to say this happened around 10pm. This is a desolate stretch of road, so it was DARK. We were all laughing, joking, listening to music, having an overall good time. I was in the right passenger seat, looking out towards the trees as we drove by. We neared this turn, and as the suburban whipped around the corner, we all fell silent. It was suddenly very cold, and very tense.

On the right side of the road we saw this figure, just standing there. By it's size and thin shape, I would say now that it was a woman. She was mummy-wrapped? I believe, in a light-colored wool blanket or something, almost like a shawl from the top of her head down to her feet, loose and raggedy looking. I remember that her right eye was visible, bright bright blue and way too wide, like she was scared. We locked eyes as we passed, and then she was gone. I looked behind me to see if she was there, but she was already out of view from the sharp turn.

It was probably the most frightening experience in my life. We all saw her. After a few moments, the driver just muttered ""what the fuck was that"" and we were all lost for words. 

Remembering our reaction to it, we don't believe it was actually a person standing there. On a dark road like this you would do more to catch the attention of someone driving by if you were stranded. It was SCARY. We all confirmed what we had saw, and then never really spoke of it again. The rest of the way home was pretty uneasy.

I remember some urban legends about that road growing up, like this:
http://forgottenusa.com/haunts/CA/2809/Highway%2092/

Which could be related in some way, but I can never be sure. So I post this in question, has anyone else had a similar experience? Or any experience driving down this road? It's hard to see something like this and yet have absolutely no idea what or who it could have been.

1375927514.0,29,self.Thetruthishere,1jxf2t,[ME] The scary woman in my room or How I adopted a spirit cat,cihuacoatl,38,9,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1jxf2t/me_the_scary_woman_in_my_room_or_how_i_adopted_a/,"Hello everyone. I posted a while ago an experience I had, with the thing I call “the man with the hat” (http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gu9fr/me_the_man_with_the_hat/  if you are interested). The story I’m going to tell you now happened about five years later, and is not really related to that experience.

I lived in an old building from the 60‘s up until five years ago. The building was old, and my apartment had been abandoned for 10 years until we moved in; it had lots of stories about ghost girls playing ball and weird voices being heard and stuff.

This happened about eight years ago. I had moved to a bigger bedroom because my brother moved to another city for college, and I took his room, across the hall where my old bedroom was. Months later, some new neighbors moved to the apartment above mine. They were a family of four: mom, dad, too teen boys.

They were a very violent family. Almost every single day they screamed at each other, and there was a big deal of physical violence involved, too: hitting, throwing objects, pushing, and so on. It was dreadful. The police came in several times, but as usual, nothing changed.

Everyone in the building was scared they might turn up dead one morning. That’s how bad it was.

Anyway, they had been living in the apartment above mine for around two, maybe three months, when one night I went to bed late. I was tired, and I closed my door so my cat couldn’t come in at night and wake me up.

I really don’t know what time it was, all I know is everything was silent and dark. In those days, I was undergoing constant episodes of sleep paralysis, so I developed my own system to stop the horrible episodes before they began. I still use that method, and fortunately, after years of meditation, I haven’t had an episode in at least a year.

Well, that night, I began hearing the horrible ringing noise that alerted me of my sleep paralysis, so I forced myself to wake up. It was very difficult, but I finally succeeded. It was around 2:30 AM (I constantly woke up around that time, long before I even knew that in Japan the witching hour is between 2 and 3 A.M.) To avoid falling asleep again, I turned on the lights and got up, so I could walk a bit in my bedroom. I grabbed a book, read for a while, and felt sleepy again around four. I decided to give it a try: if I felt another episode coming, I’d just wake up.

I went back to bed, and fell asleep. A while later (I don’t know how long), I woke up feeling hair in my face. It was a very uncomfortable feeling, and I assumed it was my own hair, but when I tried to grab it to move it aside, I realized it was not my hair. I must say I was not fully awake, but wasn’t asleep either. I could move, but the ringing was beginning to sound in my ears.

As I said, I realized it was not my hair, because it was very messy and I wore mine in a braid, so there was no chance it was mine. I opened my eyes. There was nothing. I was too scared to even try to turn on the lights, and I instinctively began praying. I looked again, and to my dismay, in the corner I (very briefly) saw a woman crouching in the ceiling (yes, she was upside down, looking at me). Her hair was long, and messy and dark, and she wore a white gown. No, don’t think about Japanese movies. She looked like a Mexican native, with a very dirty and worn cotton gown, and she was holding a baby. It looked like a baby. It was seriously scary, because I was sure it was not human. It had never been human. I don’t know how I knew. I just knew.

I closed my eyes, but I could feel her staring at me. I had never encountered something so awful, so dark, and I simply did what I knew best: cast a circle (I’m a pagan, in case you wonder). I called the elementals, I call the Gods, I begged them to help me keep that think away. The damn thing didn’t leave. I prayed harder, visualizing the bubble of golden energy around me grow bigger. I was absolutely terrified.

And then, when I was beginning to think that horrible thing was going to be my new roommate, I felt kitty paws walking in my bed. The cat lied down next to me, and I felt it’s warm weight cuddle. I could almost feel the “woman” growl, angry, and she vanished, just like that.

I thought, “Well, my cat has saved me!”, but then I remembered I closed the door and there was no way my cat was with me. I closed my eyes tight, still terrified, but the truth is, that warm, cuddly presence was actually comforting. I finally fell asleep after a while.

Next morning, my door was closed and there was no cat inside the room. I asked my parents if they had opened my door after I went to bed, and both of them said they hadn’t.

Curious thing is, that, from that day on, I constantly saw a cat-shaped shadow in the living room. I can, sometimes, “see” how spirits look like (that’s how I know how the “woman” looked like). I know it was a black and very big cat. It liked to sit on the top of the back of the grandfather chair we had. It played with my cat, and I think my cat actually liked him very much.

The weird horrible woman never appeared again, but I think she was called by the violence and hatred my neighbors generated. I'm not sure if it was a ""demon"", a poltergeist or just negative energy that I interpreted as a woman. All I know is that all the activity in the house (voices, doors opening and closing, shadow people) stopped, except for the cat. I used to thank him for his help almost every day, and left him cat food and toys sometimes. I never got a name from him, and never tried to give him one. Even my mom, the skeptic (who I think is just a witch in denial lol), admitted seeing the cat once in a while.

One day, the Black Kitty just left. I think his job was done.

I am convinced that cat was some sort of guardian that the Gods sent us to keep us protected from that inhuman horror. I have my own ideas on why it came to me as a cat, and I am sure that, if I need him again, all I need to do is call.

So, this is my story. I know how crazy it sounds. It’s up to you to believe it or not, but all I can say is it was real, too real. I still feel nervous when I remember that evil thing because I genuinelly felt in danger, and I pray to all the Gods I never encounter something like that again.

I figured I'd write about a somewhat recent experience I've had. The title refers to both people that I'm sure have had similar experiences, and also refers to the possible entity I saw. 

I like to think there are things out there that we can't explain or prove, the idea of the unknown fascinates me. I've had several paranormal experiences, but none quite so frightening as this one... It was about a month ago, and I was laying down for bed (at a good time mind you, which is a change). I'm in a dead sleep when I feel like my heart is about to burst out of my chest. The adrenaline surge wakes me from my sleep, and i shoot up to a sitting position in my bed. As soon as I sit up, my eyes lock onto a particular place in my room, the right corner at the foot of my bed. There, a small floating black mist hangs in the air. I don't think I've ever felt such fear or horror before, and I personally feel like it was an entity that meant no kindness towards me.

After a few seconds, it floats to the left side of my bed. We're not talking like ""a hovering cloud"" type floating. It moved with purpose. And again, after a few seconds, it backed out through the wall behind it.

Now I think it's fair to doubt all unconfirmed experiences unless evidence is produced. But I've never felt anything like this. This mass that was darker than the pitch black of my room, woke me from a dead sleep out of sheer horror before I even knew it was there. I could feel it's presence, an unkind one, like it was glaring back at me as if it reviled me.

I've done a little bit of googling and seen that other people have had similar experiences. Has anyone here had any moments like this? Can anyone shed any insight on what this thing may be?",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1js1fx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1js1fx/i_know_theres_more_of_you_out_there/,

And What Happened There.",DeathofaMarshin,33,6,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1h5tro/me_my_grandmothers_death_seems_to_have_called_me/,"I originally posted this in /r/Psychonaut, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1gypph/rpsychonaut_was_the_last_place_i_visited_before/).

I'd like to preface this by saying that I do not have any (known) physical or mental illnesses or issues. I do not take any medications. I was not sleep deprived nor in any emotional state when this occurred. I had (and have) some residual THC in my blood, but I was sober at the time. Please accept this as my testimony of something I experienced - no more, no less. I'm open to any considerations or recommendations, but I'm not really interested in any ""easy-way-out"" denial of my experience. I would like to know more about what exactly happened to me! And if there's something wrong with me that turns up in the future, I'll be sure to update everyone. As of now, I have NO reason to suspect that's the case. I'm really sorry about how long this is, but I tried to be as accurate and thorough as the nature of the experience would allow.

Some time, less than 2 minutes after 7:19am on June 23, 2013, something absolutely fantastic happened. It's the kind of thing you read about and dismiss as an overly emotional relative trying to make sense of a tragedy. I assure you that this isn't the case. I'm definitely not an overly emotional person. Making up stories to attract attention to myself is not something I do. And if I decided to, I would, instead, write a novel and make it more creative. Without further ado:

So ~7:19am. I'm browsing r/psychonaut and had just read a comic (saved). The last 3 frames of the comic basically depicted ego death of a DMT user. 

I looked at the last frame, realized the meaning, and thought, ""Heh, I've experienced that. Maybe DMT helps people experience things which I've been practicing (through meditation)."" I then looked at the final three frames again and proceeded to close the image and move on to something else. However, before I could click, I felt a tingling chill rush up my body.

It was a kind of feeling that I'm familiar with. It happens when I'm preparing to meditate and slowly work my way from each of my toes up to my head using my focus to relax each part as I pass. It's a pretty standard TM/Hatha technique and it usually takes about 10 minutes of stern concentration and undivided focus.

This time... this time it happened in about 4 seconds. I was lying on my bed with my body perpendicular to my monitor. My head was elevated by my left elbow so that I was looking, upright, at my monitor. I could use my right arm freely for typing/mouse movement, with the keyboard directly under my outstretched left fore-arm. It's exactly how I'm lying now, as I type this. I felt it start at my toes and rush up through my legs and pelvis, then into my chest - 4 seconds.

Anyway, as soon as the feeling swept through me, I began to feel a tightening in my chest. It reminded me, very faintly, of a certain sensation I feel in my forehead when in deep, relaxed meditation. I suppose I might describe it as ""butterfly kisses"" on the center of my forehead. I believe it's what some would consider to be the ""Third-Eye Chakra activation"". So, while I don't fully subscribe to the Eastern/New Age notions of the Chakras, I just assumed that this was something related to what they consider to be the ""Heart Chakra"". I thought, for some reason, what I was reading/thinking prompted a response which was ""activating my Heart Chakra"" (for lack of any scientific terminology).

This chest sensation I was experiencing WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE ""BUTTERFLY KISSES""! Regardless, I associated it with meditation and closed my eyes - still upright - to get a sense of how I felt and what was happening to me, physically. It was then that I decided that I was not experiencing some physical malady and that I should attempt to go into a full meditative state. So, I lay down, eyes never opening, and began to chant and control my breathing:  ""Oiiiiihhhhhhhhhhhmmmmnnnnn"".

From the time ""the tingle"" started, to this point, about 4-5 minutes had passed.

Now, I was able to relax my whole body (face, neck, jaws, scalp, etc...) and focus on the one point that was acting strangely, my chest. The very top of my pectorals was contracted tightly, pulling my shoulders into my chest and spreading my shoulder blades apart. It wasn't strenuous or painful. I could ""fight it"" in the same sense that you can fight vomiting. I could pull my shoulders outward without great effort, but when I relaxed again, they would pull back into my chest. It was very, very strange. 

The weirdest part was that I could concentrate on it and analyze what was going on with that part of my body. Normally, when I have a tense muscle, drawing my concentration to it allows me to relax it, fully. It was relaxed... it just had a new ""relaxed"" state.

Eventually, I accepted it as ""how it is going to be"". I was relaxed. I wasn't having trouble breathing nor any other issues. My heart was racing a bit, out of fear. But, it wasn't anything that seemed to be a threat to me or that I couldn't completely interrupt by pulling myself out of meditation and brushing it off. It felt very... voluntary. Once I had rationalized this idea, I felt even more relaxed and ready to find out what this ""call to meditation"" was all about.

This was the first time I got the message: ""Grandma; Your grandmother"".

My grandmother, to my knowledge at the time, was bedridden. She had been receiving doses of morphine, via dermal patch, for about 3 full days. Her outlook was bleak, but there was a chance that she may come back for hours/days before she finally let go. So, you can imagine how I might immediately reject that ""my grandmother"" had something to do with this physical phenomenon that I was experiencing. I didn't want to hear that. I dismissed it as ""something that was fresh in my mind, weighing me down."" I decided to move into a deeper state of meditation, and to forget this ""grandma"" business.

The technique I use to move deeper is similar to the ""body part focus"", except it is a relaxation of the mind. I walked through different thoughts: ideas, fears, beliefs, worries, cares... fear really stood out to me. I still thought that I had ""triggered"" some kind of ""heart chakra activation"" and that I may end up experiencing something on a completely new level. Little did I know! So, after I had swallowed my fear by thinking ""this is what you are seeking, just go to this level with no expectations."", I disacknowledged my physical form. I thought, ""I don't need my body right now, let my body take care of my body. It doesn't need my consciousness to exist."" You know, standard deep meditation techniques.

About 8-10 minutes have past at this point. I lost focus (because of my body) at some point, and did a few ""ohms"". But to get back to where you were in your meditation is much easier than when you start out (especially after all of the practice I've had).

My mind was completely quiet now! So quiet. I began to feel like the tightness in my chest was being caused by an outward force: someone or something else. It felt like it was... opening me? Drawing something from me? I can't really explain it in a useful way. I decided that I would not only let it do what it was doing, but aid it. And that's when I heard it again:

""Grandma; It's you grandmother. Your grandmother is here."" This time, the idea popped into my head from completely nowhere. I had successfully entered into a stillness. I'd forgotten my worries; I was deeper into meditation than I usually get in several hours! So, I entertained the idea. My grandmother is here. If my grandmother is here, maybe I can talk to her. I visualized the idea that my grandmother is someone I would give open access to my energy. I could be honest with my grandmother. I don't have anything to hide from my grandmother. I wanted to connect to my grandmother.

So, I thought ""aloud"", ""Grandmother, are you here?""

""XXXX, XXXX my grandbaby boy?""

I'm crying writing this - and it's not sadness. It's... fear of me acknowledging it all over again.

""Yes it's me, grandma. What is going on? What is happening?""

I was in quite a bit of doubt.

""Oh, XXXX, I'm dying. I'm dying and I don't want to die all alone.""

""You won't die alone, grandma"", I ""said"" somewhat jokingly, ""I'm with you in spirit.""

She Laughed. Then, she resumed her worried explanation:

""I knew I was dying... and, then, I came to this place. There are lights all around me, and it's beautiful, but I felt like I was so alone. I called out to Jesus, 'Jesus save me. Help me, Jesus. I am alone and I'm scared.' And then I saw that one light was brighter and stronger than all of the others. I knew that this shining star had to be Jesus. So, I came closer to it; but, that's where I found you.""

From vivid memory i remember awaking abruptly to a slight glowing outside my room. I began to make out a kneeling lady wearing white clothing with her arms raised as if to pray. Being young I felt very worried because I was looking at someone in my childhood house that i had never seen before. I covered myself with my bed cover to try to remove the sight. around 10 minutes later I uncovered my head to the same sight, the same lady kneeling in the hallway only this time a young boy was standing next to her wearing a shirt that resembled one that my brother owned. Before long the boy left and the lady turned her head in my direction. Her face was blacked out as if she had no eyes. I was so scared and confused so i covered my head again and didn't uncover till morning.

Weeks passed and i was still bothered. I had asked my brother if he had lent a boy one of his shirts and he wasn't sure what i was talking about. I was convinced that it was all my imagination until i got the urge to talk with my sister. 

I told her what I had seen that night. and in her exact words she said, ""stop joking around, your brothers been telling me the exact same story only shes praying right next to his bed."" To this day i still get chills while recounting this memory. the sight has not dwindled at all over these years and it still bothers me.

I practiced meditation and read all I could into these subjects.  One day I decided I was ready to cast a circle. Now I cast this circle just as the book said, calling the gods, meditating to a deity, offering of food and wine ect. I had an intense feeling in the circle, like I was definitely doing something right. I was enjoying my self and time flew by inside that circle until, suddenly I realized that it was late and my family was coming home. I blew out my candles and just left the circle. Never bothered closing it. It never dawned on me how important this was until it was too late.   

  So, not soon later I started seeing this shadow of sorts dodge past my bedroom door, like out of the corner of my eye type thing. And at first I didn't think anything of it. Then after a while I started to notice it. He was a tall silhouette of a man with a trench coat and a fedora hat.   I mean I saw it in broad daylight, at night. Often, like every few hours. So I started to pay attention. Now I know it was not an ordinary shadow or a reflection of light creating this pattern because I lived in that house for years and never seen it before. And I want to add that this ""shadow"" never gave me a bad vibe. This was odd because usually I'm a coward when it comes to scary stuff. So a few days went on and I never mention anything to anyone. Like what would I say? I knew my mom would think I'm weird and so would my friends. I started to imagine that this ""shadow man"" was like a guardian for me and I almost felt more secure with its passing.   
  
   Over the weekend I had my friends over. We were up in my room and I was standing by my tv putting in a movie and they were sitting behind me on my couch. And there goes my shadow man again. I turn, look at it, acknowledge it and continue to fix the dvd player. I turn around to my friends and they are jaw dropped, like they seen a ghost! And my one friend says ""uuh, your house is haunted!""  I said "" you saw that too?!"" I was So relieved that my sighting are confirmed by others and I'm not ""crazy"".

Well one particular night I had been playing as usual and I decided to go afk for a bit and get a glass of water. Since the computer was in the kitchen to begin with I only had to go about 10 feet or so. Now my kitchen is rectangular in shape and the computer was at the very end of it and my fridge at the middle opposite of the entrance-way. As I'm approaching the fridge I see a female figure standing in the entrance. Startled I immediately say ""Holy shit Mom! You scared me!"" and at the time I was still looking at her but she was still partially hidden by the darkness of the dining room so I just assumed it was her. I turned around and opened the fridge and continued talking. ""Why are you up so late anyway? It's like 3 in the morning."" As I turn around to face her she was gone. Confused I walked into the dining room and turned on the lights. When I found nothing I shrugged it off and figured she went back to sleep. I then went back to my game. 

As I was playing I couldn't really shake the feeling that something was off. Since I was really doing shitty in my game I disconnected and browsed MySpace for a bit. I couldn't stop thinking about my mom's weird behavior. Why hadn't I heard her come downstairs from her room? And why hadn't she answered me at all when I spoke to her? Finally, why did she just leave suddenly and how did she do it so quickly without me hearing her? 

Now my mother is heavy footed and on top of that my 7 pound dog makes the stairs creak when he slinks his way upstairs. So nothing made sense. I quickly started becoming really creeped out the more I thought of it. I stayed up all through the night watching T.V. with the lights on and waited until the sun came up to finally zonk out on the couch. When my mom came downstairs she woke me up and asked me why I was sleeping down there. I told her I couldn't get to sleep. I then immediately asked her if she had come downstairs in the middle of the night to get a drink of water or something. Seeing that I was uneasy she slowly replied that she had not. She then continued to ask ""What did you see last night?"" I then told her what had happened and she assured me that from what I had told her she didn't think whatever I saw was threatening but did agree that it was creepy. Just in case, she asked my uncle (a decon at the time) and his priest friend to bless the house. 

Nothing had ever happened in the house again and I still live there. I'm sorry for the overly detailed and poorly written account, but this is just how I remember everything.

Our house was built in that time also. We have a list within the chapter of brothers who have passed and we all the know the biggies. The biggest death within the fraternity chapter is a brother that hung himself in one of the rooms in the late 1980's. I currently live within that room. 

I heard stories before moving in of crazy things that have happened like laptops randomly turning on, tv's flickering on and off, him showing up in a mirror within the room. You know the regular ghost stuff. But I've experienced something else during my time in the room. 

The first thing to happen to me was I was sleeping, I just randomly wake up during the night and it is normally the same most nights in a fraternity house. Loud noises and people running through the halls but that night was different. I was woken by someone screaming at me. Not like death screams but it was like some yelled ""HEY"" really loud in my ear. That was a few weeks ago. 

Last night was the weirdest so far. I woke up because i heard some voices but before I could investigate it felt like someone jumped on my bed and put their hand over my mouth to stop me from talking. It felt like there was a knee in my chest and I couldn't breath. It happened three times. Every time it lifted away it quickly came back. By far the creepiest thing to happen to me so far.

One day I was filling up the sink to do some dishes. I left the water running and started making my way around the shop (it's not very big at all) to find something else to do in the meantime (the sinks are huge and it takes a lot of water to fill them up). I made my way back over to the sink to find the knob had been turned almost all the way off.

I figured that maybe one of my coworkers had seen the water running and turned if off so I wouldn't forget it and it wouldn't overflow. I didn't pay much attention to it. This happened a few days later, and I figured the same thing as well.

Then one day I turned on the water to fill up the sinks as usual while my coworker was taking pizza out of the oven. Keep in mind that this entire time she was taking pizzas out of the oven. I walked around the shop and back to the sink in a matter of a minute or two and the water was turned off again. This is when I put two and two together.

He also lived there as a kid and wanted to keep it in the family when my Grandma decided to sell it. I moved there when I was very young and shared a room with my brother. When I got a little older my parents decided I needed my own space and turned what was - at the time - being used as storage, into a 2nd bedroom for me. I was always crept out by this room because they always kept the door locked (probably so we couldnt play with all the boxes in there) but also it was right at the top of the stairs and there was always a really cold draft only on the very top step... almost as if you were walking through an invisible wet blanket.

Anyway once i moved in I started noticing strange things happening in the evenings. The most prominent thing happened when I was about 7 years old. I was asleep and I woke up to my blankets hovering over the bed, as soon as i opened my eyes they were ripped off the end and laying on the ground... but no one was in my room. I jumped up, ran down the stairs to where both of my parents were watching TV and told them what happened... they didnt let on that they were freaked out but they were. Another experience I had was there was a tall closet in the corner of the room that was independent from the wall. On numerous occasions i swear i could see it moving across the floor. That room was also really cold compared to the rest of the house and I always felt like someone was watching me when I was in there. I continued living in that room until we moved out of the house and had a few other strange occurrences during my stay, like objects being moved around and things like that.

A few years later we were discussing that event at a family gathering and I started to hear stories from other family members who had also stayed in that room who had never shared their experiences before now. My grandma would have been the first in the family to experience anything. She said that more than once she woke up to the feeling of someone sitting on the bed beside her. One of those times it was right on her feet and lower legs.

When my Dad was a kid it was his room for a while. Since it was a really old the window moldings had warped and couldn't be opened and therefore been nailed shut to prevent rattling. My dad says on numerous occasions he would wake up to the curtains ""blowing in the wind"" and when he would get up to check the window - it was obviously closed. He also woke up one night to the closet banging against the wall (same as mine).
Once my dad became a little older he moved into a bigger room and his younger brother stayed in there. My dad is quite a bit older than his little brother and he and my mom (who were dating at this point) were babysitting him. Only the 3 of them were at home. He heard his brother screaming from upstairs and he ran up to see what had happened. He had seen a hand come around the door and then it slammed shut.
My dads sister claims that she rolled over while she was in bed and saw someone walk out of her room, when she got up to investigate, no one was there.

I don't know of the history of the house or anything about the previous owners but everyone seemed to be sick all the time and we didnt notice it until we moved and realized that no one had had a cold in a few months. Men seemed to have really bad luck in that house. My grandmas 2nd husband died there right after I was born, a great uncle died the day following a week stay at the house and once we sold the house to move to Canada the new family that moved in dealt with a death less than a month after they moved in. Their youngest son (who was probably no older than 8) choked at the dinner table and died before he got to the hospital.

When we went back to the UK in 2007, my Dad (who is a skeptic) went to visit the house and see if he could get some photos. The new family who lived there were home and invited him inside. As soon as he walked through the door he felt violently ill and had to excuse himself to throw up. He had a migraine for about 20 minutes after he left and then he was totally fine like nothing had ever happened. Since this house I have never had any strange experiences, although the dark still freaks me out lol... I don't know what it was to this day that was doing this but it has crept the whole family out. Even my mom wouldn't sleep without the hallway light on and if my dad ever had to go out of town we were forced to stay in her room with her.

UFOs, crypto, NWO, paranormal, Atlantis, etc.  I always believe that, although not entirely true, these stories, myths, legends came from some truth.  I am glad I found a place like Reddit to tell my stories without being judged.  Anyway, here’s my story.
I recently moved out of my parents house.  I lived there with my mom, dad, sister, fiancé and our three dogs.  I moved out because, well it was time I move out.  I don’t know if this is important to mention but I am mentioning it anyways.  One night, about a week and a half before I moved out, I had a dream (or at least I think It was a dream) three alien beings were in my room.  Two of the beings where over me and one over my fiancé.  The beings where not gray but a greenish gray.  The thing is, I did NOT feel scared, threatened or terrified but the complete opposite of that, I felt calm.  They spoke to me telepathically.  They said, “Please, don’t be afraid.  We are here to help you.  To show you the true path.  To help you help others.”  At that point the one speaking reached out his hand (I say his because it was a male voice that was speaking).  Anyway, he reach out his hand to help me up.  This gesture stood out to me because they weren’t forcing me to go with them but asking me if I wanted to take the offer.  I reached back and began to help me up.  As I was getting up, my fiancé woke.  She reached for me because she was scared.  The being next to her reached for her hand and when he touched here that’s when she awakened.  She started freaking.  At that point, the being let go and tried to calm her.  Saying to both, “Please calm down, we aren’t here to harm you.  Please, we must go.” And reached for her hand again.  I assume the being assumed that since I was willing to go, that she was going too.  Because she was freaking out, I started freaking out.  I told them to leave her alone, to let her stay if she didn’t want to go.  They just kept trying to calm us down; again, not forcing us to go with them.  I sat up on my bed and as soon as I did, they were gone.  The following two days, I woke up drenched in sweat.  I don’t know if it has any relevance to the story but I mentioned it just in case it does.  I have not experienced it since.  It might sound weird but I kinda wish I do someday.  I felt at piece with them.

I come looking to these paranormal based subreddits usually for some spooky and interesting stuff, so I'm sorry if others are looking for the same from this story. Not all ghostly encounters can be horrifying I guess. 

My experiences with this Native American spirit began a few years ago. Every summer I used to go to spend a week or so at my aunt's house in Montana. 3 summers ago I am spending the night there, and am sleeping on the couch on the downstairs floor of the house. There is a hallway that leads to the family room (where I was sleeping), 2 bedrooms, the laundry room, and a bathroom. Around 1 a.m. I get up because I need to go to the bathroom. As I turn to the hallway I see a slightly translucent, but full figured Native American Indian walking down the hall, then through the wall leading into laundry room. The entire sighting lasted maybe 2 seconds tops. (Sorry that I can't give a more detailed explanation of what he looked like, I was tired and it was a very quick experience. I could tell based on what I did see that he was a Native American based off of his attire and hair.) I didn't feel threatened by the presence, and frankly wasn't even entirely sure that it happened, so I decided to just use the bathroom and then go back to sleep. 

The next morning, out of sheer curiosity, I go and talk to my aunt. I asked her:

Me: ""Hey Aunt Debbie... have you ever seen anything... weird in the downstairs hallway?""
Her: ""Why, did you?""
Me: ""I'm not sure. Maybe.""
Her: ""Did you see.. a Native American man?""

When she said that, a chill literally went up my spine. If I had imagined it, how could she have possibly seen the same thing and know what I was referring to?

Me: ""Yeah...""
Her: ""I've seen him.""

That was as far as the conversation went. I confirmed this also with one of my cousins, who lived there as well. She too had seen him. It was clear to me now that I hadn't imagined him, but since he didn't seem to be hostile I never really worried about it. That was all I ever heard of him until just about 2 weeks ago.

My aunt had just recently gotten a job here in Washington and had to leave her house in Montana. My uncle and cousin (her husband and daughter) stayed behind in Montana to sell the house, then they will be joining us here. Until they get here and are able to buy a new house, my aunt has been staying in a spare room at my Grandpa's house. Since a lot of my close family members live right by my grandpa's house (my closest cousins literally live right next door), whenever I would have a few days free I would stay at my grandpa's house as well, bunking on a couch in the family room.

Now late one night, a few days after my aunt moved in, the first strange experience happened. This is going to be a bit hard to describe, but do you know the feeling when you are literally right about to fall asleep, and then something happens happens the instantly snaps you awake for really no reason at all? Well I could tell I was seconds away from being out like a light when I heard a voice. It sounded like it was a mixture between in my head, and in the room, but still I could hear it clear as day. It said ""Is he asleep yet?"" It was a voice I hadn't ever heard before and an accent that I couldn't quite pick out. 

Needless to say I was now fully awake and looking around the room, admittedly spooked. It took me a while to convince myself that I had imagined it, but eventually I wrote it off and went to sleep. About a week later the next event happened.

It was about 3:45 a.m. and I was awake, just playing video games. I was working on picking up a few trophies on Ni No Kuni, so I have my laptop open sitting on a table next to me. I glance over at it and instantly the area surrounding it gets darker. The screen, the table, a small section of the wall behind it, everything. It looked like a shadow, as if someone where standing behind me, in between me and the lights on the ceiling. The looming shadow was accompanied by the sensation that I was not alone in the room. Upon seeing the shadow darken my little gaming corner, I turn my head around expecting to see my grandpa (he usually wakes up around 3:30-4:00ish), and instead see nothing at all. I look back towards my computer and the dimness provided by the shadow was gone completely, as was the feeling. Again, I convinced myself it was nothing and continued about my business. 

Fast forward 3 days. Yet again, around 3:45ish, playing video games again. This time I end up getting up to go to the bathroom. The bathroom is down a hallway, and in the opposite side of the bathroom is the room my aunt has been staying in. I walk towards the bathroom and as I walk past my aunt's door I see the handle twist and the door swing open. I assume it was my aunt getting up to get ready for work so I just say ""Oh hey"" and continue towards the bathroom. 

After relieving myself (couldn't have been more than 35 seconds total) I leave the bathroom and happen to look into my aunt's room and see her still sleeping soundly in bed. I instantly get a bit spooked out and hurry back to my place in the family room. My grandpa wakes up probably about 20 minutes later and I hear him wake up my aunt and ask her if she knew her door was wide open. I didn't hear anything after than and I was really curious, so I got up off of my couch bed and went to ask him.

Me: ""Hey did Aunt Debbie not know her door was open?""
Him: ""No, she said it was closed when she went to bed.""
Me: ""That's weird, I saw the door open when I was walking to the bathroom, I assumed it was her.""
Him: ""It was probably the furnace kicking in. The door must not have been closed all the way and the shifting air pushed it open""
Me: ""Yeah, must have been.""

I didn't tell him that I very clearly saw the handle turn. Unless the furnace recently started pumping out air at hurricane speeds, there is no chance in hell it was going to cause these old door handles to twist. Either way I figured there was no point in telling him so I just went back to bed. 

I tell this all to one of my cousins, the one person I can tell things to know that he won't think I'm crazy. He is also a bit spooked out, but we try to work out what it may be. He suggests it was our grandma who passed away a few years ago (we had had a few encounters with her since her passing in this house, I can post some of them later if anyone is interested). I figured this could be possible, but it didn't explain the male voice that snapped me awake that first night. Eventually we both decided that we just didn't have any idea what was happening, so there was nothing really that could be done.

Fast forward one last time to last night, when I finally figured out why things had been so strange recently. My uncle and cousin I mentioned before had finally sold the old house in Montana and arrived here as well. I was chatting with this cousin and we were discussing the things we were going to miss about their old house. I casually say ""Hey, look on the bright side, now you don't have to deal with that Indian ghost""

Her reply brought everything that had been happening recently together. She said ""I wouldn't be so sure of that. He has been following my mom since our old house in Richland (where they lived before Montana)."" I told her about everything I had experienced over the past weeks, and she said it make sense, since she had seen anything of the Native American ghost in Montana since my aunt had moved here. 

I don't know why this spirit has taken such and interest in my aunt (enough to follow her around for over 12 years so far), and I don't know why this spirit has taken an interest in me over the past few weeks. He is clearly not hostile, as if he was, he would have done something by now. Even still it is a bit discomforting to know that I am sharing this house right now with this spirit. I don't feel threatened or anything, but I think for my own sanity I will be heading back to my own house and staying there until my aunt finds herself a new house. 

Again, I apologize that this isn't very scary, and I apologize if this is tough to read. I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a horrible writer. I just felt like compiling all my encounters with this ghost and getting them out. Aside from my aunt and 2 cousins, I feel like if I told this all to anyone else they would think I am crazy.

I would like to emphasize that this actually happened, I say this so that I can ask you please, do not upvote replies to any comments as to ensure I do not recieve comment ""karma"" for telling this story. This would not be ""good karma"" that I want. I will however answer any questions to my best knowledge. And feel free to upvote this story. As we all know, you dont recieve karma for self.reddits.

PLEASE RESPECT MY WISHES!!! People at /r/nosleep were absolute jerks about this and thought I was adding this for dramatic effect, I am not. It is my personal wish that you not do this unless you find my response particularly intriguing. I have many posts in forums like ShittyAdvice and See that you are more than welcome to upvote.

I am sharing this story because I feel it was an important event in my life and feel that that it is worth sharing, not to get ""points"".

Enough, on to the story. So it was me, eric, dave, ""richie"" rich (his parents gave him a bunch of money all the time), and we were smokin some herb at erics house. eric gets a call from this girl brandi who he had been trying to smash. richie rich knew her but dave and i did not. I know this as true because dave had just moved into the st louis area from oklahoma a month or so prior (we became friends at school because he smelled weed on me), and only had met eric twice at that point.

ANYWAY, we are all like cool, because eric tells us we can play pool and stuff, and that sounded like fun. We all hop into my car and head over there, and we are just chillin upstairs talking and having a good time and what not, when i ask eric to ask brandi (socially awkward penguin that i am) if its cool that we play pool. she says sure, so we are heading downstairs. brandi is in front, then eric, then dave, then me, and then richie rich, in that order.

brandi makes it all the way down, eric is at like the last step or something, but dave stops right in the middle of the stairway, and like freezes up.. me and richie are stuck behind him, i try to give him a nudge but before i do, he says, and I quote ""What the FUCK, why did you bring me here???"" brandi turns around, and is like offended or something, and eric looks at him like hes an asshole (hes trying to get with brandi, remember?) eric goes ""What??"" a mixture of confused and offended for brandi. Dave points to the middle of the room and says ""WHO THE FUCK IS THAT?"" eric and brandi turn around and im also trying to peek my head around and see who he is talking about. eric says who??? What??? brandi has a very confused look on her face. dave says ""WHO IS THAT, FUCKING RIGHT THERE, HANGING?"" Eric is still offended and confused... but i look at brandi and she goes PALE as fuck.

Dave says ""No man fuck you guys im out"" And like pushes me out of the way and richie just moves to the side. eric suddenly has this look of realization but still sort of confused look on his face, and brandi starts crying.. she says ""Take him the fuck home"", so I do, and I come back. Dave says not a word to me for the whole ride, 15 min or so, when i drop him off, im like ""See ya around, man..."" He looks at me angrily and says ""Yeah, whatever"" and slams my door as he leaves.

So I go back to brandi's place (as I cant just leave my friends there) and i come back in. eric is like come here man and we both go out on her back porch. He explains to me, slightly shaken up, that brandi's older brother hung himself in the basement a year before this, from the rafters. He doesnt understand how dave knew this because brandi doesnt know dave, and dave is a nice guy and wouldnt mess with somoene who's sibling died, especially who killed themselves... Also, he happened to point at the exact spot he hung himself, according to brandi.

The only explanation we came up with is somehow he saw the ghost of her brother, or that it was such a ""heavy"" incident that it left some kind of imprint on the room that somehow only dave picked up. Since her brothers suicide a year prior to this, there was drop ceiling put in to cover up the rafters (i guess they didnt want to think about it so they remodeled). So there was no way for anyone to hang from the ceiling as far as i could see, and dave wouldnt have known this either.

Brandi was a fucking wreck and had just started to get over her brothers death, but this brought it all back for her and she was a total mess. we spent the rest of the day comforting her and sharing our weed to cheer her up which did help. I'm still friends with dave to this day but have never mentioned this incident to him and do not plan on it. it clearly fucked him up bad enough to leave a house full of potential friends in a city hes brand new at. This happened in 2006, we were all juniors in high school. I'm now 23 and have never forgotten this incident. I had been to her house a bunch of times since then and never noticed anything fucked up myself. However, every time i walked down those steps my skin CRAWLED thinking about this moment.

So yep, thats my actual ghost story. I personally have never seen a ""ghost"".. but the only way ive thought of explaining this incident is like i said before.. the guy hanging himself must have been a very intense moment in time (it has to be, it a very serious thing to even consider suicide let alone do it) and it must have left some fucked-up imprint in time and it was just still lurking around.. and i guess dave just picked up on it. Or this was just an elaborate ruse plotted by dave and eric to get in brandi's pants, but I really dont want to believe this as dave would never go for something like that. Thats the best explanation ive got, folks. I'm interested to see what other people think here at thetruthishere. Ive never been able to think of any ""rational"" explanations, and will answer any questions to my best ability.

Now, so that I dont ruin the story for you, I asked that you not upvote my comments because I do not want to receive karma for telling a story about my friend's brother's suicide. As the title suggests, people in nosleep upvoted my comments simply to piss me off, and this is an actual story. I do not care about points on the internet, I am concerned with real-world karma. This is something I base my life on. I do good actions and hope karma will find me. I also hope that karma will come to those who hurt other people.

Plagued by a Demon

It started with an Ouija Board, as things of this nature are wont to do. I was about 8 at the time, playing with a friend of mine, being 8 year old's and having fun scaring the crap out of each other. Suddenly we both felt a chill run down our spines at the same time. We freaked for a moment, then decided it was nothing. We played some video games and then passed out around 11.

Now, I don't remember this next bit, but as she tells it, she woke up at 3 or so in the morning, to witness me, sitting facing the wall, rocking back and forth silently. She tried calling out to me softly, no answer. She walked over and said my name again, right next to me. I just kept rocking with no response. Finally, after a couple of minutes apparently I came to, told her I was sleepwalking and then just simply crawled back into bed. The next morning, she didn't say anything, apparently still too freaked out by the experience (more so since I never mentioned it to her, I only got this story out of her a few years later).

Soon after, weird things started happening around me, lights would flicker, or tune off entirely. I'd come back to things being moved in my room with no one else home, I would see random shadows out of the corners of my eyes, etc etc. I tried telling my parents but they brushed it off as morbid imagination (to be fair, I was one of those weird girls who read stuff like Stephen King - yes even at 8, I was an awesome reader - but I'm rambling, so I digress).

We soon moved into an old house, and it slowly started to get worse. Eventually, even my parents stuff started getting moved around, and I was blamed for it, my persistent denials meaning noting to them. Every opportunity I used to try to tell them the house was haunted was met with scorn at best, and anger at worst. I stared having to go to therapy do deal with my 'imagination issues'.

Then, one day, around when I turned 11, for no reason it stopped. I was on edge for weeks, waiting for something to happen. Agonizingly slow weeks, waiting for something, anything to happen. I slowly started to relax, thinking it was over. Tried to forget about it for the most part. My parents and I were getting along better, there was no more fighting, and everyone commented on how much 'better' I was suddenly doing. I was happier than I'd been in years.....

At 13, I was in a horrible car accident, I was in the hospital for 4 months, and a wheelchair for 8. That's when it started again. However, it was worse than it had ever been, strange things started happening inside the hospital while I was there, including things that went missing from other patients rooms. We had an organization that came once a week with animals for everyone to pet, but none of them would come near me. (I was rather distraught by that btw... fucking love animals) Luckily, this time, no one was blaming me for anything that was happening.

When I was able to go home again, it started giving me nightmares. I would feel it watching me from the end of the hallway in the basement, waiting. I just didn't know for what.

Mum and I left my step dad around the time I turned 16, I went to stay with my aunt for six months while mum found us an apartment (she's not the best planner sometimes) and for the most part, it seemed to leave me alone. For three years it was never more than some sort of vague malevolent presence that followed me from place to place. (This moving around is how I figured out it wasn't the house, it was me.)

Then I turned 20. It was like a switch flipped, I suddenly developed a crippling anxiety problem, I started refusing to go out anywhere that wasn't somewhere I HAD to be. I could feel the 'presence' - as I called it in my head at the time - getting more and more..... well happier is the only way I could describe it. That's when I met my current boyfriend. It turned hostile again almost immediately, it once actively prevented us from leaving the house by giving me a panic attack every time I got within 5 feet of the front door. We tried getting rid of it, with mild success, but it only lasted a couple of months before it was back, and watching. I started waking up every day at 4 am, no matter when I had gone to bed, wide awake unable to get back to sleep. I felt it leering at me wherever I went, I felt its hunger, I know it felt my fear.

Finally it got to be too much, so we tried talking to it. After all, it hadn't done anything TO bad, what could go wrong? Shortly after, I started being unable to eat, and throwing up anything I did manage to keep in my stomach, to the point where I had to be hospitalized on three separate occasions in a span of a month and a half, hooked up to IV's and given meds to calm me down. After weeks of agony and anxiety I put my foot down, no more communicating, this thing had to go.

My boyfriend and I set up in the kitchen, a protective circle, a box of salt, incense and candles. He handed me the box of salt, and I tried to put it down next to me, he shook his head and pressed it into my arms, telling me to hold on to it. Immediately after I did so I stared vomiting again, uncontrollably into a bucket I had handy, never letting go of the salt. Finally it subsided enough that we could concentrate on getting rid of whatever it was. He took my hand, and I concentrated on giving him all the energy I could. About half way through, I started to feel an excruciating pain just underneath my rib cage, I felt like something had stabbed me, I started crying, thinking I was going to die. Cupboards next to us shook slightly, and the bathroom door slammed down the hall, it was pissed. The pain kept getting worse and worse, to the point where I almost passed out. Then suddenly, it was gone. Well, from inside the house. We could feel it outside, raging at us, unable to do anything. We salted all the entrances, including the windows, before going to bed.

It's more or less gone now, but I still feel it sometimes, trying to get back in, I just have to be strong enough not to let it.

Throughout my entire life, my mother has always known when something is going on with me, or my siblings. I've always attributed it to 'a mother's intuition', but this 'intuition' never fails to shock me at it's accuracy and consistency.


  A prime example was when I was in my freshman year of high school. There was a man at my school, who had returned for a 'victory lap' (another year after his grade 12), and was 19 years of age. He took an interest in me, and my 14 year old self never quite had the confidence to tell me to leave me alone despite how unnerved I always felt around him.


  I lived in the country, but I had taken to walking to my grandparent's house every day after school rather than take the long bus ride home, where my dad, who worked at a different school, would come pick me up to take me home. The walk took about 40 minutes.


This man, we'll just call him D, noticed me walking after school. I saw him observing me with his group of friends (they'd stand outside and smoke, and I'd walk by on the other side of the street). One day, he ran after me. I stopped and asked him what was up. He asked if he could walk me home. I felt uncomfortable, and did not want to tell him that it was only my grandparent's house. I merely said sure, and we walked.


  He openly flirted with me for most of the walk, to which I uncomfortably tried to deflect and neutralize. Finally, we were in this secluded area that goes over a bridge at the end of a street, that led to the street that went to my grandparents. He grabbed me, and pressed me up against the railing of the bridge, suddenly intense. He told me, very fiercely, that he would make me want him. I was afraid, I had no idea what to do.


  Suddenly, someone was calling my name. I looked over, and my mom was half running toward the bridge. D saw her coming, and bolted. My mom, who didn't have a car, had gotten my grandma or grandpa (I can't remember which) to drive her in from the country, because she said she had a really bad feeling and felt like she needed to find me. She said the feeling got so intense that she left my grandparents to start walking to find me (I usually took the same way there every day).


  Needless to say, I avoided that guy like the plague afterward, took the bus home for a few weeks, and always made sure I had a friend with me at school. He left me alone a few months later.


  There's been other times as well (for me, and for my siblings), but if I posted them all, this would become quite long to read! I wouldn't want to bore anyone :P


  But to this day, I swear she has an odd, psychic-type of connection to her kids. It blows my mind every time.

First of all let me just say that nothing over the top or scary has happened to me. These experiences are just noteworthy and strange.

The first one happened when I was 15. My friend and I were hanging out in her living room, just talking about random things when suddenly out of the corner of my eye I see something moving. I stopped in mid-sentence and looked directly at the movement. There were two humanoid silhouettes in the room with us. They were clear (see-thru and no color) and when they moved the air sort of rippled through them. At this point I noticed my friend was completely still and silent, and looking exactly where I was looking. One of the figures walked over and sat on the chair right across mine, while the other stood next to him/her/it. I whispered to my friend, very slowly and warily ""Do you see what I'm seeing?"" and in the same manner she said ""Uh-huh"". Shortly after this the figures just vanished. The whole encounter lasted about a minute or so.

The second incident was when I was in my early 20s. My husband and I decided to take a walk around 4 am. It started raining so we sat under an awning type of thing in an empty parking lot (one of those things you park your car under). We were quietly talking when out of nowhere, I hear a very distinct whistle coming from directly behind me. It definitely sounded like a human whistle. The kind of whistle you would blow when you want to get someone's attention. Startled, I immediately turned around. As soon as I did something brushed up against my hair and flew out in front of us. It was... a pair of dragonfly wings. *Not* a dragonfly. *Just* the wings. I've seen thousands, maybe even millions of dragonflies in my life and *this* was no dragonfly. Or an insect at all, for that matter. We both froze, just looking at this thing hovering maybe 3 ft ahead of us. It was under the rain, and didn't seem to be affected by it one bit. I kept searching for a body but it had none! Imagine nothing but a pair of wings flying in front of you. I didn't know what to make of it. My husband eventually said ""What... IS that?"" and I said I had no idea. But by the way it kept hovering in front of us suggested that it was intently checking us out. Then it calmly flew away into the woods ahead... We've NEVER seen anything like it since.

I've always been a scientific, level headed person who needs cold hard evidence to believe anything. These personal experiences have made me realize that there ARE things out there that science can't -or doesn't- explain. If you have any theories on either one of my encounters I'd love to hear them.

So It was dinner time and i was eating my rice when i hear a series of loud footsteps rushing down the stairs. My grandma appeared on the stairs and threw a wadded piece of paper at my face.

I went and chased her up the stairs, but she made it up first and turned right into my parents' room. I saw her running into the room ( the lights were off ) and she turned left going into the bathroom there, but before she turned, she waved at me with a eerie smile. I turn around and looked directly into my grandma's room which was to the left of the stairs.

There she was, sitting there singing buddhist chants with the TV on cartoons (its the only thing she can watch since she cannot speak english) 
Now since it was so long ago it seemed like a dream, but this part here was very clear and vivid in my memory so I knew it had to be true.
I talked to her ( in vietnamese ) and told her I just saw her run into the other room,  she denied it and told me she had been sitting in her room the whole time.

To this day, i've never been able to figure out who that was until several years later I read about dopplegangers, but im still unsure what it exactly was.

I originally submitted this to r/nosleep (under the same title, in case you want to cross reference), however I just found this board, and it being true story I thought I should post it. It's long, apologies in advance. Names have been changed.


This is a true story, one of several creepy experiences I've enjoyed in my lifetime. It takes place during the summer of '09, July or August, I'm not sure which, and in my town's graveyard. Now I live in a town called Milton, Massachusetts. It's pretty old, as far as old in America goes (around 1640), and you may have heard of it, money.com/money magazine voted it #2 town in the States in 2011. It's pretty nice place, all in all, but hell to grow up in as a kid as there is absolutely nothing to do here.

Our cemetary is just as old, with the oldest graves going back to before the town was incorporated into the town of Dorchester around 1640. It's a nice area, nothing scary about it at all unless you're weak hearted, covering a dozen or so acres, with rolling hills and a duck pond. I'm very used to it. As kids my friends and I used to play Man Hunt there at night, and I did a research project on it during college. There are several famous people buried there, including Howard Johnson (of the resturaunt fame); George Hollingworth, a semi-famous American painter; and numerous Free Masons, including a 32nd degree mason (33rd degree is as high as you can get). Anyway, to the story.
I was hanging out with my friend Chris one night drinking some mead he had home brewed. We got bored of the usual videogames/music/TV and decided to wander around town, which eventually lead us to the cemetery. Now, we both have strong intestional fortitude when it comes to cemeteries. We can wander around them at all hours of the night without getting creeped out, no matter which cemetery it is (though I'm sure the fact that we were both very familiar with our one helped a bit). We ended up in the old section of the place, which runs along a well lit and oft used road. It was probably around midnight, give or take 30 minutes.

There's a part of this section which contains old crypts from the 1800's. They have granite frames set into the earth at a roughly 35-40 degree angle, with heavy steel doors welded shut to the stone by their hinges and their handles. I had done my research of the cemetery prior to this outing so I shared with Chris that the reason for this was because the crypts were prone to flooding and they became a safety hazard. Being in a buzzed state, Chris suggested we grab a blow torch from his garage and hack our way into one to see what there was to see. We laughed, whimsically entertaining the idea. Wouldn't it be grand? Of course there were cars passing every so often and the situation was already a little sketchy – I was certaintly nervous. He really seemed to want to do it though, so to placate him I took a look at the various doors to see which ones would be most easily hacked into, on the premise that we would come back another time (though of course we wouldn't). Well, in looking at these I came across something I hadn't noticed before during my various tours of the cemetery. At the corner of one of the crypt doors was a sizeable chunk of rock that had come out, and by using your flashlight you could see into the interior. I took a look in, giving it a cursurary view, but there really wasn't much to see. Crumbling stairs halfway covered with dirt and god knows what else which opened up into the crypt proper, but you really couldn't see into it because of the angle of the stone. I judged there to be about 3 feet of space between the floor and the ceiling, lining up pretty well with the flooding story. It was all very gray, not terribly exciting. I called him over to have a look. He was excited, almost estatic at the news. He took my flashlight and squatted on the ground and peered in. All the while cars were passing us by not 120 feet away and I was glancing around, on alert, increasingly nervous that a cop would come by and make trouble for us (though it could be argued we were making trouble for ourselves).

He's mumbling about how cool it is, but I wasn't really paying attention, but I know he mentioned something about the blow torch again, and possibly making thermite to get in. All of a sudden he stops dead and quickly drops onto his stomach to get a better vantige point into the cemetery.
“Hey, Baron.” I heard him say. His actual engagement of me brought my attention to what he was actually saying. “Yea?” “I saw something down there.” “You're full of shit. I looked before I called you, there wasn't anything except dirt.” “No, really, I see something in the left hand corner where the stairs empty out into the chamber. Here take a look.” He hands me back the flashlight and I hold the beam of light against my chest to douse it while giving another look around the street for cars, then I drop down onto my stomach as he had, fix the light into the hole and peer in.

Sure enough, he wasn't lying. At the left hand corner, right where he said it would be, was a gleaming white dome. A skull. I don't know how I missed it when I first peered into the crypt, I guess it was nerves, but I saw it now, clear as day. I let out an awed, excited murmur and tried to leverage the flashlight and my body so I could get a clearer look deeper into the crypt, hoping the see the rest of a skeleton. Hoping to see something to send those all-coveted-shivers which I love down my spine.

I got what I wanted, but it wasn't in the form of the skeleton. I saw something move from the very edge of my vision to beyond it, seeking refuge in the back of the crypt. I'm sure it was just an animal which burrowed it way back in there from underneath, that's what I tell myself at least, but I can tell you this in all honesty: it was pale, it moved awkwardly on four legs, it didn't appear to have fur and it was the size of a midsized dog. My heart froze and time with it, like the universe slammed on the breaks of the cosmic bus. This experience was WAY beyond my creepy comfort level. For a minute I panicked, then just like that * snap * time was back to normal. I sat up on my knees bolt upright, stood and told him we had to go. He didn't want to, and I didn't care. I just walked away and he was forced to follow me asking me all the way back to his place what I had seen. I didn't tell him about it until we were well away from any woods and in the well lit streets. He was silent, and in the end we both agreed not to even mention opening those doors again.

I hoped in my car and went home soon after. As I lay in my bed I got to thinking (no I didn't think that whatever “it” was was after me, I doubt it could stand the light of day) about the hole in crypt. What had caused it? Granite is an extremely rugged stone and logic tells me it was probably the work of water expanding into ice in a crack over centuries of New England weather. But what if that wasn't the whole of it, what if it was an airhole? What if that thing had been aiding the natural process by chipping way at it bit by bit?
Some time has passed since then, and I still enjoy going on bike rides through the cemetery during the day, though I try to avoid that section of crypts, which isn't hard considering the nearest road is 60 feet away. And I absolutely avoid it at night, unless I'm with at least 5 other people.

I've debated on whether posting this or not because it's quite long, and also quite different from majority of the stories posted on here so far. My little disclaimer is that I identify myself more of an existentialist. Except, there are some things that I cannot explain and make things more confusing for me, as I'm sure many of you guys can relate.

I'm Vietnamese, Chinese, and French. So as you can guess, it's an asian ghost story, yet nonetheless true. I was born in Vietnam and lived in a house that is known to be haunted. We moved to the US when I was about three or so, but I remember every single night for dinner, my father would light up a joss stick and we would sit and wait until the joss stick had burned down to its nub. I later found out it was to pay ""respect"" to the spirits living with us and can be quite common in the Vietnamese and Chinese culture. By waiting, it means we are waiting for them to ""eat"" first, then we were allowed to eat after the joss stick has burned down. 

Anyway, the layout of the house is very important. My house was very small, and the attic is the second story. So imagine a living room, bedroom, diner, all in one. There is a small square cut out that attics normally have, and there's a wooden ladder. Right underneath that space behind the ladder was my parent's bed. I'm not good at math, or I'd give you an example in square feet.

This is before I was born and my mother told me this as it was her experience. She was sick, and sleeping in her bed while everyone was off at work. She felt a stagnant cold air and it woke her up. We live in the tropics, so it is hot and very humid. As you can guess, we were too poor to have AC. In fact, many businesses didn't have AC at that time. Anyway, when she opened her eyes, she saw a pair of red shoes and part of a red traditional Vietnamese dress flowing as if someone was sitting on the edge of the attic's opening, kicking their legs ""like a little child would"". There was no body. Just the shoes and dress. She was aware of her being sick and perhaps hallucinating things so she turned around and went back to bed. About what seems an hour or so, she felt that stagnant air became really ice cold. So she rolled around to grab her blanket. What she saw was the red dress and the shoes again, floating in the corner near the door. That is why I explained the layout of the house; it is not a big space so she saw it quite clearly. She prayed (in buddhism/taoism) in case it wasn't her being sick and seeing things. She kept her eyes closed and prayed. She was awake by now. She told the spirit that she is a clean person so there is no reason for the spirit to bother her or our family. She asked the spirit to leave our house. She had the courage to do so because she always told me, ""If you didn't do anything wrong, then there's nothing to be afraid of."" About 10 minutes later, she felt the room got warm again, and when she opened her eyes, the spirit was gone. 

Some key details I want to point out for you guys. In the Vietnamese and Chinese culture, wearing anything red and showing up as a spirit means it's an evil/menacing spirit. Perhaps that spirit was a wanderer; we don't know and don't want to know. Yes, my mother was fully aware that she was sick and she thought she could be hallucinating things too. But she said she wasn't severely sick, and she was wide awake during the second appearance. I know it sounds so crazy, but I have quite a bit of stories in that house, so it is up to you to believe it or not.

We winded up staying there more then expected but its does not matter because we had nothing to do anyways. We live in a town that has a supposed ""Devil Tree"" Where a cop used to kidnap girls and go hang them on that tree in sometime in the 1800-1900. The story is quiet famous among people who live here in this town. The cop had his house build there and everything, when visiting the tree it looks scary and is really big. But just a tree.... At night it just looks scary.
Also if you explore around the tree you can find the old foundation of the someones house ( I suppose to the police man that lived there? )
Anyways back to the story now that you kinda have a image in your head of little girls being kidnaped and hung on a tree next to where my friend lives in my town. ( Also next to the cemetery )
We left Mcdonalds and are headed back to his house the time was presumably 3am, I turned on his street and my car lights where shinning at a little girl running the opposite directions from us in a white dress! With white old looking shoes. Not your regular running shoes from Nike. Nope this girl was dressed in what I would like to call 1800-1900 attire. I put the high beams on just to be sure I am not seeing anything or my brain is playing tricks and no there was a girl running... A little girl! 
She turned on a street and as my car passed from the street she turned we decided, FUCK THAT! Keep driving! Do not go after this girl. So we did, and I winded up sleeping over his house because I was scared that the ""Devil tree"" stories were real and that what we saw was a ghost of a girl who got murdered over there.
Anyways I got more two more paranormal activity stories if you guys want to hear them lol.

Also why is this so creepy?

1336860452.0,26,self.Thetruthishere,tk64l,[ME]The reason I became involved with paranormal investigations.,mydarkesthour24,34,8,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tk64l/methe_reason_i_became_involved_with_paranormal/,"I would like to start off by saying that I am in no way a writer, I was going to put this on r/nosleep, but found it better fitting over here. I would like to apologize if I make some grammatical errors as I am typing this on my phone. I would also like to mention that this is a  100% true event of my first account of the paranormal.

I grew up in NYC (now live in Southern California), and for awhile, my family tried turning to Christianity for comfort. I remember I was about 8 years old, it was about 1995/96. The church we attended was putting together a trip for the children to attend a two week long summer camp in Pennsylvania at a Christian campsite.  Our church had been doing this for awhile, and I had attended the last couple summers so I knew it would be a fun time. The name of the camp is Mont Lawn Camp, here is the website http://www.montlawncamps.org/Mont_Lawn_Retreats/Home.html

Now fast forward about halfway through the trip, about one week in. The camp counselors held a late night service in the chapel which ended around 11pm. Me and one other kid were walking towards the exit, just talking about baseball and such; and it was as soon as we stepped outside the church that I notice a change in this kid's face.  It literally looked like all the happiness was sucked out of him, and he started yelling obscenities and throwing his fists at me. A nearby counselor noticed what was going on and grabs the kids from behind and lifts him up. The counselor could barely keep a hold of the kid due to this unnatural amount of strength that he somehow obtained. Eventually, the counselor finally pins the kid down to the ground, puts one hand on the kids head, and prays. He continues praying as another counselor runs up and helps in holding down this kid as he continues trying to fight. Little by little, the kid calms; and it was at this moment that I witnessed something that would make me question the boundaries of this world.  I saw a being lift up out of this kid, and sprint off into the darkness of the woods behind the chapel. The oddest thing about what it was, was that it was wearing ragged middle eastern type clothing, and looked like it was completely covered in boils.  If this thing was a real human, there would have been no way it could have sprinted into the pitch black woods without tripping, and a giant 40 ft ditch was right behind the chapel. I look around at the other people, waiting for some sort of reaction, but nobody even flinched. 

I always thought that I would be afraid of this sort of thing, but instead, I was left more curious. I kept quiet about it until the next day, when I approached the counselor who had pinned the kid down and prayed and explained what I saw. He just gave me some kind words and left me on my way.

Many years later, it just lingered in my head, and it sparked me to go off looking for more proof.  I have been with a couple paranormal groups and experienced lots more activity since then.

The whole Christian lifestyle for my family was short lived, and we would all consider ourselves agnostic now. But I have researched my family history which I discovered has ties to voodoo and santeria. I don't necessarily believe in a religious approach on the paranormal, strictly scientific. I always am very skeptic on my investigations. 

I have never posted this experience online but I hope you enjoyed the read and I understand if you take it with a grain of salt, as would I.

Advice/thoughts?,baobabs,30,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/snohy/attempting_to_understand_paranormal_experience/,"So a little background on me. I have practiced meditation for a few years now (on and off), and this year, I have noticed a shift in my level of consciousness, or more just how I perceive things around me. However, I had never truly had a paranormal encounter until a few weeks ago. I live in an older townhouse in Chicago, and my roommate (who's also sensitive to these things) and I have always sensed some sort of presence in the house, but we could never really put our finger on it. I'll just put it out there that I have another roommate who hasn't ever really sensed anything in the house.

For a few weeks, I felt very uneasy every time I would pass by my dining room, I definitely felt like there was a person there every time I would walk by, and I stopped spending time in there. One day, I was leaving my room to leave the house, and I saw three people sitting in the dining room, at the table. There were two men and a woman, and they looked at me as I passed them and seemed very shocked, as if I had startled them. Mind you, for any those of you who might ask me if I'm sure this wasn't a hallucination, I didn't see these people in the physical realm, like i would see a person, it was like a projection in my mind that was being played for me, i don't know, it's hard to explain. I had never really experienced that either. But I did see them and saw their presence. A couple of weeks after that experience (I had brushed it aside and somewhat convinced myself that it was just my overactive imagination), I was in my room and heard a voice in my room. It was faint, as if it was coming from another place (hard to explain, sorry) but it was an old man's voice, and he said, ""No, just listen"". That's all I heard, and it was enough to freak me out quite a bit. Again, I pushed it aside and later that night, I was laying in bed. I was experiencing a bad bout of insomnia, and at around four in the morning, all of a sudden I hear the floors of my room creak and a burst of indigo light came into my room. I connected it with the man's voice I had heard, and thought, ""please leave me alone."" Ten minutes later, I hear a knock on my door. It is four in the morning. Again, it was faint, not as loud as a regular knock would sound. I said audibly, ""please go away"". After that, there was nothing else. This was two days ago. After this incident, I have experienced the sounds of footsteps walking around in my living room when no one was there, and also at one point I felt and heard a presence in my room. I also experienced a ""projection"" this morning of a woman walking by my bedroom door and stopping in front of it for a second. I feel like ever since my first sighting I've opened up some sort of door and I can now see people/or maybe they're reaching out to me or something, I'm not sure. I'm really wondering what's going on and to be honest, I'm freaking out quite a bit. I don't think I'm going crazy, but most people I talk to would probably think I am. I would just like some guidance or advice if anyone has experienced something similar, just to know how to deal with this.

1331071471.0,28,self.Thetruthishere,qkqq8,[FAM]The Angel that helped saved my grandmother ,M3nt0R,30,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/qkqq8/famthe_angel_that_helped_saved_my_grandmother/,"My grandmother was born in 1941 post-civil war Spain.  Rough times for my great grandmother, but my grandmother was just a baby.  It was a small town in the mountainous northwest of Spain, where the hills meet the shores.  **Very** beautiful, but slow to progress.  Economy was terrible, technology didn't reach those areas.

They had dirt roads and mule carts even up until the 60's just as a frame of reference. Anyhow, it was the early 40's, and my great grandmother we'll call her ""R"" started noticing her daugher ""M"" was getting sick.  She became progressively sick and really became very ill, almost deathly ill.  She was essentially a newborn by the way, within her first months.

One day, in the local market where the townspeople would meet, often with townspeople from neighboring towns (they were very small communities) she ran into an older woman from the next town over.  The older woman walked right up to R and told her that M ""colheu o aire do morto.""

I don't really have a translation for this, it's one of those expressions that don't exist in other languages.  It was said that when someone died, if you attended the funeral you could catch the ""air of the dead"" or ""essence"" of the dead so to speak.  Pregnant women were believed to be more at risk, but people often rushed to pick their clothing from the clothesline before the funeral because they didn't want to catch the 'air of the dead' so to speak.

Anyhow, R had gone to a funeral when she was pregnant with M because in small communities, if someone dies chances are you were close with that person.  You know their siblings, parents, cousins.  You're probably a distant cousin of their's in the first place, as I still have countless 3rd and 4th cousins in that small town.  So she went and carried on fine until she had her daughter and shortly after birth R had noticed M getting ill.

So she went to that market and the old woman told her she caught the air.  She pulled her to the side and gave her a little prayer written down on a sheet of paper and told her to pray at a certain part of the cemetery at noon.  I'm not sure if it was a particular person's gravestone, if it was just a cross of jesus that was a monument in the cemetery, but I know it was in the cemetery.

R asked her who she was and where she lived so after she did the ritual if it worked she'd go out of her way to visit her and thank her in person again.  The lady gave her the location of her house and they parted ways.

At midnight R did as she was instructed and prayed at the cemetery reciting the prayer she had been handed.  Within a few days, she noticed M had expelled hair that was the exact length and color of the deceased person from the funeral R attended when she was pregnant with M.  My mother wasn't sure if M coughed it up, or expelled it some other way, but she knew the hair was the same color and length of the deceased, months after the funeral before M was even born.

She had started showing signs of getting better even before expelling the hair, pretty much after R completed her ritual.

R then went over to the neighboring town and looked for the house.  She followed the directions she was told to get to the house (remember most places don't have a nice and neat grid system like America you go by landmarks and relative directions).  She ended up exactly where she was told and sure enough there was a little stone house there, and it looked like it hadn't really been maintained.  It almost looked abandoned.

She asked the neighbors of the house and they looked at her a bit funny asking her if she was joking.  She explained the situation and about the old lady that had approached her at the market and solved her problem for her.  She just wanted to give thanks and pay her respects to the woman for having helped her out.

They told her there was an old lady exactly as she had described that had lived in that house up until about a year or so before when she died.  R had seen her just days earlier in the market when she was approached by her and helped out entirely.

She was honestly convinced (and I can't fault her for this) that the lady was an angel that had gone down to help her in her time of need.  It was a rough post-civil war time as I said, life was extremely tough.  People had to walk days to get to a major city to trade and carry loads of goods there and back with no cars or anything whatsoever.

I was out hiking in the foothills around my hometown with the rest of my family. We often made day trips like this and before gas was so expensive it was a common weekend activity. Most of my family as well as the family dogs had gone ahead on the trail we were walking but me and my dad stayed behind so I could climb and check out some of the large rocks and boulders along the path. Going off the trail a little bit I was checking out a very large rock formation when I realized there was a small cave on the other side of it. Being a dumb kid with his dad nearby I quickly ran in to explore it. It being a very sunny day it was taking a moment for my eyes to adjust to the dark. I heard my dad coming around the rocks asking what I had found. He suddenly stopped behind me and for the first time in my life he sounded scared. He told me to look at the ground and head straight for an a small opening at the other end of the cave. Now scared out my mind I asked him why as I plant my eyes on the ground. He shakily says there are things I don't want to see in there and I need to get out. Still confused but scared as hell I run for the other end of the cave, get through the opening, and keep running away from the rocks. Back on the trail my dad is suddenly beside me and says we need to find the rest of the family. As we quickly head up the trail I ask what was in there. He simply says ""bad stuff"". We catch up to the family and he tells my mother to take me to the car, while he and my much older brother go back to the cave. They come back a little while later both looking very shaken. He tells my mother we need to contact someone to come up here. As we are heading home I ask my brother what was in the cave. He then tells me that I had been standing in a witches circle or (as I know now) a pentagram. He then explains that the entire cave was covered in satanic markings and dead (fully skinned and mutilated) animals. Where I was standing there was a severed goats head on a rope hanging above me. We contact authorities and they find several other ritual sites in that area. Needless to say we never went there again.

Basically there are 4 reasons: 1) Once you share your story, that's it. 2) Some people don't have any stories to tell. 3) Lack of promotion and recruitment and 4) Moderator neglect. We failed you. However, this subreddit has grown a lot despite our complete failure to promote. We shall right our wrongs and bring more people in. 

In order to get valuable feedback, I posted [Let's make an effort to keep the community alive and help it grow](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kv58b/lets_make_an_effort_to_keep_the_community_alive/) (you are still welcome to offer feedback!) You guys listened as we've grown ~~15 members overnight and have 4 new posts!~~ WOW! Thanks to ThomasDennis and r/nosleep, we've grown over 150 new members in the last 3 hours!

But we learned something: it's not our name that holds us back. If we limit the TheTruth to just personal encounter posts then we will fail as a subreddit pretty quickly. This is obviously not what we want, though are starting to see happen. These changes are designed to encourage a wider range of content, above and beyond just personal encounter posts.
------

**If you'll notice to the right, we've added tag systems.** This will allow everyone to keep posting, without fear of breaking any rules. It will allow people to read what they want to read, but also participate and post things relating to encounters without actually having an experience of their own. 

And of course, with the implementation of the new tag system, you are free to share stories by people you trust, not just personal encounters. The tag system is VERY important because of course, [ME] will hold more weight than [FoF], but interesting none-the-less. 

Double tagging is totally fine if you are not sure where it goes, or think it can fall under multiple categories. Example: If you're unsure an [FoF] is true, you can tag [FoF/THY] or [FoF/DIS]. We're also thinking of implementing a color code system for anything that has been debunked. A confirmed debunk will only be accepted if the OP accepts the explanation as truth. We're not a debunking community though, so that's not the only type of discussions we hope to see. 

As for the departure from personal encounters, here are some EXAMPLES OF AWESOME!
------
Here's a great example of what we hope to see, and it's already happening without the mods (good on you!) Wintermonk posted [Recent Oddity](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kusp9/recent_oddity/) about number stations and provided a very intriguing translation of what he was listening to. This could be tagged [PI] for paranormal investigation since he is actively searching and translating something strange. He could tag it [THY] if he wishes to theorize. 

His post encouraged Otahak to ask [""Numbers Stations: What do we know?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kv0ue/numbers_stations_what_do_we_know/). This post would be tagged [DIS].

Our original idea for this sub would've discouraged both of these types, but these are actually quite interesting and both Shittycontributor and I are pumped that it happened. It introduced us to potential!

We've decided to be more relaxed with what the rules shall entail. Shittycontributor has made an example post: [After reading the 'Numbers Station' thread I was reminded of this post on /creepy a while ago. It's one of the strangest stories I've read on Reddit. [FoF]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kw1mi/after_reading_the_numbers_station_thread_i_was/). This will now be allowed, too, though we still encourage you to comment or PM these people and send them our way. 

Another example is Shittycontributor's [The Pilliga [DIS]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kw4qp/the_pilliga_dis/). Note how all the information needed to discuss is located within the text. He offers links, information, what he's heard of it, and why he believes it to be true, or worthy of a discussion. [LEG] was introduced after this post, but this would be a good one to tag [LEG/DIS]. This prompted Flatteblack to post [The Pilliga [FAM]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kw86z/the_pilliga_fam/). With the tag system, you can read a discussion and post an encounter related to it, and people interested can easily find them and read.

If the community starts to stagnate again, the Mods will take more care in recruiting or assigning fun ""homework"" assignments that could include things like ""ask a neighbor about an encounter he or she may have had"" as recommended by arpeggioslowly. You'd be surprised by what people are afraid to talk about. Everyone can post these, too.

Thanks for helping us get to 600+ members in 2 months! I'm excited to see how this develops, and I hope you are as well. Don't worry, we don't want to see the quality of content degrade with these new rules. PM a mod if you feel a story slides into r/nosleep category. 

TL;DR: As long as the content of your post falls under the ethos we have already established here at TheTruth then it is welcome, whether it be a post about something your cousins' friend saw or a discussion on a local legend. Just be sure to tag it according to the side bar! However, we still stand by the original principle that it must be something you believe to be true, or something widely regarded as believable. WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE FAN FICTION or CREATIVE WRITING!

I talked to my mom about it to be sure I had the details right.

Let me preface by telling you the following: my sister and I have the same mom and different dads, her dad is an atheist and our mom was a ""christian""-only she never went to church or took my sister to church, said most of the bible was BS, and never talked about the devil, angels, demons, etc.  All my sister was really told about religion was that God exists and Jesus exists.  I, personally, would consider myself a deist who's agnostic about the rest.  

Okay, anyway.  When my sister was a baby, she was best friends with a boy named Sam.  Sam was the grandson of her babysitter, so they spent a lot of time together.  When Sam was two, he drowned.  My mom had to tell my sister, who wasn't even two yet, that her best friend had died.  Mom told her that he was in ""Heaven"" but didn't mention angels or anything else like that.

Shortly after he died, my sister was holding the phone in her hand when she said to my mom, ""It's Sam.  He says 'hi' and that he's okay.""  She then went on to have a conversation with him.  Later that night, she pointed to her ceiling and said, ""Can you see him, Mommy?  Sam is flying with the angels.  He's right there!""  My mom said she clearly looked like she could see something, something other than her ceiling.  For a few nights after that, my sister would tell my mom that she could see Sam up there, flying around with the ""angels.""

Now, like I said, I'm not a religious person.  I don't believe in angels.  But I do believe my sister saw something.  My mom said it kind of freaked her out  because it seemed like much more than a baby making things up.  It felt real to her.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1ilfcg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1ilfcg/fam_my_mom_and_sisters_experience/,

My friend Logan goes to the Citadel, it is a military college in South Carolina. It was a known fact that years before, a cadet hung themselves in his room and the Citadel itself is known to be haunted. So one night logan and his roommate had to clean their room for inspection the next morning. This is a hardcore inspection that doesnt happen very often so they cleaned like hell that night so the place was perfect.
At about 2am, Logan heard a book bag being unzipped. He assumed it was his roommate so he went back to sleep. A little while later he heard more noises and leaned over his bunk bed to shut his roommate up, but he was sound asleep. Logan looked over to the door and saw this grayish figure. The figure looked at him, smiled, then walked through the wall. Logan was almost in tears and he woke his room mate up. The room was a completely unorganized. Things had been moved and their clothes looked as if someone had been trying them on. The next day he had a priest come and bless the room with holy water.

Anyways, when I was 10 or 11 I had an experience. 
One day in either the Spring or Summer (I can't remember but either way I knew that you could go outside and not have to wear a coat and you could leave the windows open b/c the weather was that nice) I was home with my mother. She was in the kitchen cooking and I was in the living room lying on my back on the three-seat sofa staring at the wall. 


I remember feeling so comfortable, like I had nothing in life to worry about. This next part is hard to explain, trust me, I know how this sounds so excuse me for sounding like an idiot but I really wish that I could prove this to everyone and just let the world know that this is what I saw, heard and felt.


I remember I had the understanding of not being alone in the room, I didn't react to that feeling and I didn't much care. You would think that I'd be curious/scared/amazed or whatever, but I didn't even acknowledge this event. Next thing that happens is I could all of a sudden see myself from behind, like an out-of-body experience but I wasn't at my normal height, I was higher and I'm looking at myself on the couch and I can remember looking at my feet b/c I was moving them side to side and my stomach was breathing in and out and my eyes were open. 


Again I remember having a feeling of 'I don't give a shit' like it didn't effect me. Then within seconds I started to realize that I shouldn't be at this height and I felt something move within me (the out-of-body me) and that's when I knew I had either A) taken over the view of the person who was in the room with me unknowingly or B) That person did it on purpose to show me myself and show the view they had of me. I somehow knew that this person was male, had black hair, blue eyes, fair skin, was wearing a purple suit with a black shirt, was fairly tall and his name was Jack.


It's like a switch was turned on b/c before I knew it the next second I felt a 'thrill' go through my body (the-body-that-was-on-the-sofa-me) and I was no more viewing myself from behind. I remember my body going stiff and being too afraid to get up and run for my mom or look behind me and see this purple suit guy. But the last thing that happened is till this day the craziest and oddly satisfying thing I think of when it comes to this person, I remember my right ear, which was nearest to the backrest of the couch, getting warm and all of sudden I hear a male voice say ""How did you like that?"". The question was so audible that I could feel the breath of that voice on my ear and the tingling sensation from it. 


In a mixture of excitement, adrenaline and fucking fear I got right the fuck up and ran to the kitchen where I poured my heart out to my mom and all she did was look at me half scared and half in disbelief and said nothing. When I got angry with her and told her to help me she said that I was just dreaming. 


Maybe it was a dream and maybe it wasn't, but till this day life has not been the same. Sporadically ever since than I dream of this person and when I lucid dream I try and ask him all these questions though he never throws me anything solid. And when we do meet in a dream it's like we attack each other with strong hugs like if we may never see each other again, sometimes I feel like he strains to be in my dream but can't hold on too long. It's been 13 years and I can't take this shit any longer.


I think I have to go to a hypnosis to determine the cause of this shit.

So my Dad was about 12 and my auntie was about 5, my auntie was in bed with my Grandma and my dad was in his own room and my grandad was working nights somewhere. 
All of a sudden there was a humming through the entire house and no one could move, and my Dad's room was orange. For some reason my auntie could still move and she got up to pull the curtains back to see what it was and my Grandma managed to grab her somehow and tell her to get back in bed, then she couldn't move again. This lasted for about 12 minutes and they could shout to each other but still couldn't move.
After this the humming stopped and everything was fine and they went to check each other. The next day the next door neighbour came out and said there was an orange disc floating above the house for about 12 minutes and then it just shot off impossibly quick.

The reason we think my dad was abducted is because ever since then he's had a little bump in his finger and he's literally cut it out and it just grows back. 
But here's the kicker. My dad and auntie were talking about the whole ordeal about 20 years later and my grandma said she came into my dad's room to find him in the corner and not in his bed. My dad couldn't believe it he thought he was in bed. Anyway I've heard that when they abduct you they wipe your memory and put you back in the wrong place because they are trying to get away quick.
I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't heard the story from all 3 of them. Yeah freaky stuff. 

We think they follow us anyway because my dad has had similar stuff happen to him. He's been at home alone when he was about 18-19 and all of a sudden the lights went off and he said things felt different and he immediatley started whimpering like a baby. Now my dad was a football hooligan, boxer and was covered in tattoos by this age, not the type to be easily scared. 
He went to the light switch and said he felt something touch his shoulder and gently push him to the floor and he could do nothing, he said he felt like he wanted to punch and lash out but this hand paralyzed him and took control of his body. Then before he knew it, it was about 1pm and he was in bed.
I've had a similar experience recently, where I was in bed on my laptop and something put a hand on me and i felt the same thing but it just lay me down and then i jumped and It was a couple hours later. When it happened to me something was looking at me, I can't remember what it looked like only that it was tall and had dark skin, like blacky grey skin. And my laptop just kinda floated off my lap towards the floor. The fear i felt while I was being forced down to my bed was horrible. My brain was tingling and I couldn't do anything. It was completeley bizzare.

I would like to share with you a story about my house (renting) that happened last night. 

 I'll preface first by saying this house has ghosts. We had an investigation team come in and do their thing. At the conclusion it was determined that there were actually several spirits residing in our house, one of which was my late mother. She has moved on (with intentions of coming to visit, of course), but a few remained. The previous owner of the house (several times described as looking and acting like Jeff Dunham's Walter puppet), a little boy and a woman who only observes, at one spot of the house. There were also several open portals that were closed. Since then, everything has been quiet. But enough with the back story, on to the meat and potatoes.

The past couple of days, our paranormal activities have been coming back. Random cold spots, coming down the stairs/through the door and catching the last sounds of a conversation when no one is there, the (muffled) sounds of a party on the main floor from the floor above, as well as a general feeling of uneasiness in the basement. One night while laying in bed I was talking with my wife, and I felt a breeze. Shortly after the dream catcher we had hung a few weeks ago spun. Not violently, but enough to make me check all the windows. We have three windows in our room, and they are energy efficient windows that our landlord put in 2 or so years ago. They are a dream and reduced our heating bill by quite a bit, and are not drafty at all compared to the old windows we had. All three windows were shut and locked tight. In addition to cold spots and lighter breezes I've felt the few nights before, I am becoming leery about the situation.

This next part I just found out about an hour or so ago over the phone, and ultimately what prompted me to post this. Some details are a bit sketchy right now but I'll come back and update later when I get more. Fast forward to last night. Our house is one that never really sleeps, because all the people (there are 7 people total living in this house) working different shifts. Anyways, one roomie (We'll call her Jill) is the last one up for the night with her boyfriend (Jack). They are hanging out in her room when Jack heads to the kitchen to retrieve a salad he had made earlier. He comes back up and he sees what he thinks is my wife standing in the doorway to our room in a long white dress. I don't remember if he says anything or not, but he just heads to his room. He begins to tell Jill about that and he is about to open the door and show her, but she is very frightened by it. He goes up to the door to open it, but stops and says ""No"" and sits back down. He then begins to laugh and talk about that spirit, as well as two others (which he didn't give names). He says he feels them and knows their movements. He says that they only want some attention and to be noticed. They don't want to hurt anyone but said explicitly they (don't know if one two or all or which one) don't like my wife. They During this he is laughing one moment, and crying the next. He starts to describe what he thinks is an older man. He never saw the face, he only felt it. He felt it move into another room across the hall, attached to ours. At this point, he sits back and he closes his eyes half way, but they begin to flutter and his jaw starts to contort in what Jill says ""The exorcist style"". She is also writing all this down (either while it's happening or after) and tries to wake him up. She is terrified at this point. He snaps out of it and they decide to nope the fuck out of there and go to her parents for the night.

The next morning she is reading her notes and describing what happened to Jack, and he has no recollection of saying or doing anything. In fact, he gets just as afraid as Jill was when it was happening. Just as I am feeling a little right now. I guess afraid is the wrong word. I guess I am very leery of this situation now. I'm not about to be run out of my own home from something that doesn't belong.

Thanks for reading this wall 'o text here. I hope you guys have some ideas and whatnot. I think a couple portals opened back up and is starting to wreak some havoc, but I'm not professional. Like I said above I'll try and come back with more details once I get them.

Many times, I will think of random things, which are almost always obscure, off-the-wall things, and then I will see or hear them later in the day. I don't mean something obvious like thinking of a popular Jimi Hendrix song and then hearing it on a classic rock station later in the day. That's just nice. 

On my way to work one day, I started thinking of an episode of Pokemon. A very specific scene, and lines of dialogue. It's important to know that I am not a big Pokemon fan. I know of it, I've seen a few random episodes at friends' houses, but otherwise have little to no interest in it. When I got to work, my first stop was the employee break room, where the television was on. Pokemon was playing, the same episode and scene I was thinking of for seemingly no reason on my way to work.

Earlier at work last night, I thought: ""karma karma karma karma chameleon."" It's on the frontpage of Reddit today.

One time in my teens, I had a dream that I ran into a then-teacher of mine, Mr. Damani, inside of a bank. Later that day, I ran into Mr. Damani coming out of a grocery store that I was on my way to in order to get penny rolls from the bank that was inside.

This kind of thing happens to me at least once a month, if not more often than that. There are times when it's a vague, easy to run into thing (like the Hendrix example), and other times when it's absolutely way the fuck out there obscure, and then I see or hear about the exact thing I was thinking about (the dream involving Mr. Damani).

The first was when I was 16 or so. I was asleep, and I had a dream that I was watching myself from above my body. This is the only time I have ever had a dream like this. I watched as something, or someone, came in through my bedroom window. It had been closed and locked before I went to bed (I am positive I locked it, as a few months prior I'd learned the window top would shimmy down if it wasn't locked and wasps built nests in the crack), as it was cold outside. I watched the figure, shadowy but shaped like a man, watch me for a few moments and then turn to my desk. It seemed to hear or sense something that startled it, and it knocked a china figurine I had on the desk to the floor, smashing it. When I woke up, the window was open and the figurine was smashed on the floor.

The second is the longest story, and the scariest. I was exploring the land behind a local wooded park with some friends. We found a clearing, if you could call it that. It had some brush and trees in it, but everything was dead. There were seven trees, five still standing, that looked as though they had never had branches. The other two had fallen and looked like they had rotted out from the inside. These were tall trees, easily four to five times my height, and looked broken off at the top although the tops were nowhere to be found. After a few minutes here I felt something overwhelmingly telling me to LEAVE. I have never felt so scared in my entire life. It felt like something was pressing in on me from all sides. I managed to let my friends know this, it was hard to speak. As we left, we all felt something chasing us. We all heard different things. One of us heard footsteps behind us. One person heard screaming. I felt breath on my neck. The scariest, though, was the girl I was running behind. As I was behind her, I know there was no one to do this to her for time for her to have done this to herself. On her back, there appeared scratches...like someone ran their fingernail over her skin too hard, causing it to welt in red lines, but not draw blood. It drew a VERY clear picture across her back. When we made it back to the cars, we felt it leave, but I felt something pulling me, like it was trying to take me out of my body. Since then, whenever I am within a couple miles of that area, I feel something watching me. I later learned that several people have hung themselves in that park, although not near that clearing. I have since then only been in contact with one of the people I was with, but he remembers it just as clearly as I do.

The third is less creepy. I was leaving for work one day and felt a hand on my shoulder, pressing down hard enough to make me stop. I was completely alone, and I heard in sortof a mental whisper that I should wait. I left 10 minutes later. On my way into work that day I saw no fewer than 4 potentially fatal car accidents.

I believe the last one was my grandfather, warning me. The other two...I have no idea whether they were ghosts or something else.

1353607358.0,27,self.Thetruthishere,13mndq,[ME] A few of my experiences. ,StellaUniverse,39,12,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/13mndq/me_a_few_of_my_experiences/,"There won't be any fancy writing, but I've lurked for a while and thought I'd share a few experiences that I've had over the years.

1) This may be the scariest. I either had a VERY active imagination as a child, or frequently encountered a malevolent spirit, or possibly the devil himself. 

I was raised Catholic, but my family was not very religious and we did not go to church every Sunday. Nevertheless, I always said a prayer before I went to sleep growing up.

Starting when I was about 3, I started to see a man in the reflection of my bathtub..looking at me. He was bald, with a gold earring (like a Genie is how I always described him, and red eyes). I remember at first being too terrified to say anything and would pretend that I didn't see him, but he would talk to me and start to ""push my buttons"", like by making fun of me or my family and just not being nice...I don't remember specifics but I feel like he would tell me to do bad things. Nothing horrible like murder or kill anyone, but things like to be mean to my siblings, etc.

Most every time I would see this ""man"", I would grow scared enough that I would start screaming for my mom. She would come running into the bathroom and I would insist that a man was in the reflection, but that he was gone now. I would always see him laugh at me and then disappear before my mom arrived. I think that sometimes I would give up, growing used to his presence. I was so young...I wasn't really thinking it through much more, and my mom always told me it was my imagination. I wanted to believe her. 

Gradually I worked up my courage, and one day, when this man appeared, I asked him who he was. He gave me a a sly grin and told me ""The devil"". Well, folks, as a 3-4 year old kid, I was genuinely terrified. Obviously I didn't want to hang with the devil. I would still call for my mom, he would still laugh and disappear, and she would still tell me it was my imagination. 

Gradually, I grew bolder. If he would show up and tell me to do bad things, I would either stick my fingers in my ears and go ""nananana I can't hear you"". Fed up, I started to just say ""God is stronger than you and God wins in the end, so shut up"". The sick smile would be wiped off his face instantly and a look of disgust would appear. Then,  if I remember, his power to speak would stop and he would gradually disappear. 

Only one person believed me, a friend who was my age. We always had an intense connection. We even believed we had been sisters ""In the sky before we were born"". She even claimed she saw his face too, even though she never heard it speak. We didn't speak of it much growing up and in college I asked her what she remembered. Our descriptions matched up exactly. Here is what she says she remembered:

She says we were having a sleepover, and she woke up in the middle of the night to pee. We must have been about 5. She says she was afraid to go alone in the dark, but that I absolutely refused to go with her and said she'd have to wait until morning. She decided to go by herself. She says as she was washing her hands, she saw his reflection in the mirror looking at her. She yelped and ran back into the room, and I said ""You saw him too??"", and then I told her everything.

I never told other friends at school because I didn't want them to think i was crazy. By the time I was about 6, I didn't see it anymore. 
When I asked my mom how many times I screamed for her to come running, she said probably about 80 times. She didn't know what to think.

2) This is an experience involving the same friend. When we were about 8, we were playing outside. There was a giant empty field next to my house with three creepy looking trees that were about as tall as a 2-3 story house. These trees had very sharp jagged limbs that extended far outwards, with the leaves concealing much of the inside,  so that they formed kind of a canopy of the inside. Sometimes I would hang out on the ""inside"" of the tree's canopy, feeling like I had my own house. Sometimes though, it just seemed way too creepy out there. I was always very in tune with nature as a child, and I remember being interested because there was a giant eagle's nest at the top of one of these trees and I always dreamed of climbing all the way to the top.

Anyway. One day, my friend was over, and we got in a fight over something. She was walking ahead of me in this field and ignoring me, when she suddenly looked at the tree to her right and let out a scream and started running. I rolled my eyes, thinking she was being dramatic and feeling even more infuriated at her. I marched over to the tree so I could prove how stupid she was being and how there was nothing there. What I saw was the shadowy figure of a small Native American woman looking out at me in hate and anger. I was clearly not welcome there. I let out a scream involuntarily, and also started running, meeting my friend back at my house, where the front door was wide open (Had my mom left it open?). We ran up to my rom and gazed out of my blinds at the tree, speculating on what we had both saw. We agreed that we both saw an angry looking Native American woman. We both agreed that we did not think she was alive.

3) This one isn't creepy, but more paranormal. This involves the SAME friend. I told you, we had a special connection. Around this time, we were about 13. We were lying on the floor at her house with our heads together, dozing off. I don't remember what, but something triggered me thinking that she had read my mind. So I started to play a game. I told her I would send her images and numbers with my mind's eye, and she should tell me if she sees anything. It went something like this..

""Ok what number do you see?"" ""57"" ""Ok now?"" ""138"", ""Now?"" ""72"" ""Now?"" ""210"" and so on. Gradually we moved on to images. We were able to show each other complex images with our mind's eye such as an eagle landing on a branch, a dolphin jumping, flowers blooming. It was all correct each time we ""guessed"". I felt like our half asleep state with our heads put together connected our minds on some sort of ""circuit"". I've never been able to recreate this.

4) This story occured in college with a different friend. I partied a lot in college, especially my first 2 years. I went to a very large school, one of the biggest in the country. I was at a party my freshman year and as the young, naive freshman I was, I was dolled up in my heels and way too much makeup. I was very drunk, dancing, and just enjoying myself as usual. These three guys showed up and they instantly gave me a bad vibe, but my drunk self wasn't very receptive to these feelings and I ignored it. I know it sounds stereotypical, but these guys were also all dressed in black. I think it was the theme for their band or something. So I carried on with my partying, chatting people up. All of a sudden one of these guys walks up and responds to a loud joke I had just told, and instantly killed my mood. All I could feel was severe discomfort. I talked to him briefly and excused myself, and carried on dancing. 

At some point in the night, I had hurt my ankle (Damn heels!). I was not going to be able to walk back to my dorm. So my two best friends and I accepted a ride from these guys. I felt uneasy, but pushed the feeling aside. I was even more drunk at this point. As soon as I got into their jeep, I instantly sobered up. My discomfort level was a 9/10. I looked around, making sure my friends were in the car with me. They were. Phew. I felt a little safer.

As they took us home, I started formulating a plan. If they drove past my dorm, and I thought there was a 50/50 shot that they wouldn't stop there, then I would jump out at the nearest stoplight. I felt urgently as though I had no other choice. I felt so relieved when they did stop at my dorm, and clambered out of the car.

The guy who tried to talk to me earlier clearly ""liked"" me. I am not the kind of girl who would flirt with a guy if I didn't actually like him, but I felt like I was in survival mode. He stopped me as I was trying to climb out as though he wanted to talk to me. I giggled nervously and gave him a kiss on the cheek, saying ""call me"", and pushed past him. Of course I didn't want him to call me. And I never ever have kissed a guy on the cheek like that for no reason. Eww.

So I passed out, and promptly forgot about the night. Until two nights later.

One of my best friends from the party was spending the night. It was about 2:30 am and we'd been up talking in the dark. We often did this, even though we had class in the morning. All of a sudden, i remembered the creepy guys, and thought I should mention to my friend how I felt.

""Hey you know those guys who took us home the other night?""

""yeah""

""well I got REALLY bad vibes from them.""

""yeah, me too.""

""I don't mean just bad..I mean....I feel like they could rape or kill someone. Something was really off with them.""

""yeah. I kind of feel that way too. I agree. The bad thing is *Our other best friend* likes one of them...they've started dating. ""

""What? I have to tell her to stay far far away.. Something is really wrong with them.""

All of a sudden, I felt a heavy negativity in the room. I just felt an intense darkness, like something was in the room with us. A presence. I also felt sadness and fear, panic. I felt it but I knew it wasn't my feelings. I wanted to cry, but it was like those feelings were speaking through me. I had no reason to cry or feel panicked. I was safe in my bed. I relayed my feelings to my friend and she stated that she felt the same way. We both felt a heavy negativity in the room.

I decided to call our other friend, even though it was 3 am. I just felt like I had to make sure she was ok. No answer.

We decided whatever was going on, we were going to say a prayer. We felt like the heaviness lifted and we were able to fall asleep.

The next morning, our friend called. One of the guys had woken her up at her dorm in the middle of the night, around 3 am. He wanted to talk to her about their ""relationship"". Then, one thing led to another, and she felt she couldn't say no. When I heard her story, I realized that he had raped her.

[Here is an experience my girlfriend's mom had when my girlfriend was a baby](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/12dejl/fam_girlfriends_moms_experience/) and [here are some experiences we have all had](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/12btwr/some_happenings_in_this_house/).

I'm currently writing this on my phone while hiding under the covers. Yes, I am this terrified right now. I just got home and had another one of many ghost experiences. I will edit this post when its safe to come out and provide links to my other entries here.

I came home from work (I work 3rd shift so the only other person home is my girlfriends brother who is sleeping) and was just screwing around on my computer. Let me note first that my bedroom door was open when I got home. Didn't think too much of that because I left it cracked and one of their dogs could have easily pushed it open. Not sure if it's relevant to the experience so I decided to push it open.

Anyways I'm sitting here on my computer at about 7:15 am. I'm browsing Reddit and texting my girlfriend, and all of a sudden I hear the very sudden and definite sound of movement come from inside my closet. The closet door was closed. I just stared at it for a minute, shocked. Having had paranormal experiences in this house before, I was not in the mood to see an aparition, as both my girlfriend and her brother had seen one before. However I knew I had to open the closet door. I had to find out what was going on in there. Maybe the cat had gotten inside it?

So I gather the courage and swing the closet door open and nothing is there. Nothing is out of the ordinary. Absolutely nothing was knocked over. No cat in the closet. Nothing. I immediately called my girlfriend and turned on a voice recorder to see if I could capture evps. I'm going to analyze the recorder tonight. I'm not going to do a EVP session because I'm too fucking scared right now. I just put the recorder down on the dresser to see if it could capture anything on it's own. I will analyze the recordings and edit to fix any grammar issues and add more later, when I decide to come out from the covers.

*EDIT: FIXED SOME GRAMMAR, MADE SOME THINGS CLEARER (SUCH AS EVP SESSION - NOT OUIJA SESSION, ALSO ADDED LINKS TO OTHER EXPERIENCES).*

*EDIT 2/UPDATE:*
Since I work third shift I just woke up. I am going to analyze the digital recorder and see if there's anything on it. If there is I will post it on YouTube for you guys.

Okay, so after this happened I left my closet door open because I thought maybe whatever was in the closet wanted it open, and stayed under the covers for a while. Eventually I decided that I needed to grow a pair and come out from the covers, so I turned on some TV. I settled on Spongebob, and tried not to think about what had just happened. All of a sudden I heard what sounded like several faint (as if they were coming from outside the house) and disortorted dog barks. When I say distorted they didn't sound like a regular dog park. They made sort of a ""whap"" sound. That's the best I can describe it. I payed no attention to it and decided to just get some sleep.

1351801035.0,29,self.Thetruthishere,12h4m1,[FAM] [ME] I have no idea on how or why this things started to happen.,Ryssa,35,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/12h4m1/fam_me_i_have_no_idea_on_how_or_why_this_things/,"So hi there. I found Reddit some weeks ago and have been reading your stories and your personal experiences ever since. At first, I only visited r/nosleep frequently, but I just found out about r/thetruthishere. And I personally prefer it to r/nosleep, because here I don't have to wonder if it's fiction or not.
Anyways, skipping that part. After reading some of the experiences here, I started to wonder if I should share mine or not. Today I finally decided to do so, and that's why I'm here. I'll share with you some of my family's experiences and ones I had my own. It's a little long, and I'm sorry if my grammar and English aren't good, I tried my best. Also, my writing skills are not awesome, lol.


My house is really old. My grandmother was born in 1940, and she grew up here, and before her parents moved in, there were people that lived here too, so you can get an idea of its age just by that. 
My grandmother told me that her aunt, that lived with them, died in the room that is now my parents'. She found funny that my mum wouldn't sleep in the room alone when she was single. My grandmother's mother also died here, but in the kitchen if I'm not mistaken. She didn't talk about that often. I'm just mentioning these  because I do not know if it's relevant to the case but I believe it's not. Although they died here and this house being old, we never experienced anything paranormal all these years. That is, until some time ago.
As you may guess, we had to fix the house, since it was literally falling apart, and there was not enough space for everyone (I live here with my parents, my sister, my aunt and uncle and their four kids, and with my grandmother when she was alive. A lot of people, I know. Big family). Now we have two floors, with enough space and rooms for everyone, fortunately. That was not what triggered the paranormal stuff, though.

My older cousin, we'll call her S, is very into paranormal stuff like me. She lived with us before going to France. She was attending University that time, so she would be up late studying. One night, she heard three knocks at her door. She thought it was her father, he went to check on her sometimes, so she went and opened the door. No one. Getting back to her seat, someone knocked again. She decided to leave the studies and go to sleep that night. Some nights after that, she was again studying at night. S said that the her study light went off, and right after, she heard the knocks again. She ignored it and left studies once again. She said that when checking time in her phone, it was 3:00 AM. That did not happen again, but the knocks on her door happened almost every night. My mom thinks she attracted something to her, because she is always looking for answers about that kind of stuff. I'm not sure what to think.

My younger cousin, which we will call C, brought her other cousin,M, to sleep over. I have no idea why, but they decided to play with an Ouija board (home made) that night. C told me they weren't even thinking this was real, and were with their fingers on the glass (they used a glass instead of a pointer) without any belief it would move. One should know that it is not safe to toy with this kind of thing. The glass did not move for a while when they asked if someone was there. Some minutes later they laughed at each other, commenting at how stupid they were for believing it would move and took their hands out of the glass. When they did, C said it moved by his own and neither of them was touching it. And instead of continuing the session, they just ran off and let the board alone. I think they went back to the room later to get rid of the board. From then on, my aunt claims she's been hearing someone up the stairs every now and then when it's late. And she has no idea C and M played with the Ouija board, C only told that to me because she is afraid everyone blames her for messing with the spirits. I do believe this was a trigger.

My sister always spends a lot of time in the bathroom at night. We have no mirror, so she takes a round one my mom has. One night, she came back from the bathroom white as paper, holding the mirror in front of her chest. My mother asked her if she was okay, and she then told us why she was so pale. She said that when coming out of the bathroom, she was with her eyes on the mirror looking at herself while walking and she saw something behind her. So instead of turning back, she raised the mirror so she could see what or who it was. She said there was a woman behind her. A very pale woman with red messy hair and black eyes. When she looked back there was no one there, and she went running to the room scared as hell. It didn't happen again. But recently, she was talking to a friend of hers, that is experiencing some really creepy paranormal stuff at her house, and the girl told her that when she was going to shower, she opened the shower curtain and there was a woman with the exact same appearance my sister saw before. My sister told her about what happened to herself and after some minutes of talking about the woman, they concluded it was the same both had seen. I don't know what it means.

Now, for myself, it started with some ""simple"" stuff. When my grandmother was alive, she shared her room with both me and my sister. So sometimes she would decide and have a major cleaning and some of our stuff would be missing because she'd misplace them. Now I had a small little box, hand made, under my bed with some plastic jewelry I used as a kid. Once, I went to check on it and it was open, with its cover by its side. I ignored it and put it back, thinking it could be my grandmother's doing when she was sweeping the floor and hit accidentally the box and its cover would fall. But it started happening every day and the cover was always perfectly placed on the left side of the box so I stopped believing that. I asked my grandmother if she opened it or saw someone open it, she said she didn't. I did the same with everyone that usually came into my room and no one had done it. So I decided to try something, which I thought was stupid but actually gave me results. I placed the box on its usual spot, closed, and locked the room. Later, me and my mom went to check on it, and there it was, open, with its cover by its left side. My mom is really afraid of this kind of stuff, so she did what I told her not to do. She took the box and threw it away.

Some months after. My grandmother had already passed away. I was in the living room watching TV alone, around 1:00 AM. The house is normally silent around that time, so if someone gets out of the room or walks around I can hear it perfectly. I started hearing someone dragging slowly their feet through the hallway. Like it had some heavy slippers or something. I brushed it off and kept watching TV. But it started to get on my nerves, someone walking that slow and dragging their feet with all that laziness.
The hallway is connected to the kitchen, and if you get in my house, you go through it and then there's the kitchen. On your right side there's the stairs that leads to my uncle and aunt's part of the house, and right after there's my living room door. Now, to get to the kitchen there's a step. I felt a thrill over my spine when I heard that someone taking the step down and 're-dragging' their feet again very slowly. Everyone was sleeping at this time, who could it be ? My dad usually comes to check on me but he does not walk that slow. All I could think was that there was a strange inside my house. My mind was screaming ""A thief. Oh my god."" repeatedly. And instead of hiding and keeping quiet, I did the most stupid thing someone would never ever do if there was someone strange and probably dangerous in their house. I started calling for my mom. ""Mom, can you come here a sec ? Moooom !"" I figured if the thief thought I thought he was my mom, he'd think someone else was awake and be gone. But the feet kept dragging until it got to the living room's door. My heart stopped. And then again, I did the most stupid thing someone could ever do. I didn't even think on what I was doing. I got up, turned off the TV and opened the living room's door, ran to my room like I was running for my life. Needless to say, there was no one around.  
After that, once in a while, while I was playing PS3 in my parents' room, I'd hear whispers that gave me chills. I could never make out what it said, but it was like someone was whispering stuff right into my ears. Whenever that happened I'd always leave the game and go somewhere else where I was not alone. Fortunately,  that has stopped.

Now, recently, when I am in my living room, or when I go to my aunt and uncle's room (which is right above my living room), I always feel a sort of tingle on the right side of my back. It's like it's numb or something. I only feel that when I'm on the mentioned rooms. I don't know if it's paranormal, probably not, but it is a weird sensation.

And these last days, there's someone sitting at the end of my bed at night. It started one night when I felt some kind of weight on my feet. I never really thought about it, it was a light weight and I assumed as my imagination working because I was half asleep. There was one night though, me and my sister couldn't sleep and stood up late talking, each one on their bed. Then I felt that weight over my feet again. But this time it got heavier. Heavier enough for me to stay a little alarmed. ""Hey, I think there's something on my feet and I don't know what it is."" I told my sister. She said I was being stupid and that we should really go to sleep. The weight on my feet got heavier. You know the feeling when someone's sitting slowly on your lap, and you start to feel the weight progressively heavier over your legs ? I felt that on my feet. So I tried moving my feet up to move away whatever it was. Thing is, I couldn't. It was like someone sat their butt right on my feet and I couldn't move them unless the person got up. I told my sister I had someone sittin in my feet and that I couldn't move them and for her to go call someone, but she thought I was just trying to scare her and ignored. So I only stood there completely scared, not daring to move until the weight got less and less heavy and eventually went away. It keeps happening every now and then, but now I just try not to move and keep telling myself not to be afraid. After all it isn't attempting to do anything, it just sits there for a while.

One night around Halloween, I was working on the computer, typing a paper of some sort.  I was alone in my room and the door was shut.  

I needed to hit the bathroom, so I left my room, locking it behind me.  Yes, I am certain I locked it, as our floor was having issues with thefts.  My floor's bathroom was literally right next to my room, so I was gone for only 2-3 minutes.  When I returned, I used my key to unlock my door and returned to my computer.

In my open Word Document, my cursor was blinking next to the number ""666"" which had been typed several spaces below the paragraph I was working on.

It gave me chills.  However, I would like to offer some rational explanations of what could have occurred:

1) My floor's residence assistant (RA) was a good friend of mine.  As an RA, he had keys to all the rooms on his floor.  Had he witnessed me leaving, let himself in, and typed this on my computer as a prank? 

2) Had something fallen off of my shelf onto the number pad, typing some random characters (several carriage returns and a number) on to my screen?  

3) Had I unknowingly typed the number myself when scooting the chair back from the desk?

4) Was my computer infected with malware or a prank program of some sort?

After seeing requests to share some more of my experiences I've decided to tell you all a couple of stories about my least favorite piece of furniture in my home. If you care to read about my first experience here's the link  http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/11hf4h/me_jim/


I apologize about the length of this post but it is all relevant. I will probably end up putting this into two posts.

When I was in the ninth grade I was never able to sleep for the whole night. I don’t really know why I couldn't but after sleeping for only a few hours I found that it would give me enough energy to get me through the rest of the night and the day without a problem. Back then I didn't have a TV in my room so I used to go into the living room with my dog Da Vinci where we would watch cartoons while the rest of my family slept. 

My first experience took place during my usual nightly television viewing. I had been lying down with Da Vinci when I found my attention drawn to the rocking chair across the room. I had never paid much attention to it before and I had never known where it hard came from. As I continued to stare at it I noticed that it rocked a little, it was 3 in the morning so I just blamed what I had saw on my imagination until the rocking had become faster as if someone was actually sitting in the chair. By now Da Vinci was whimpering rather loudly and we both stared at it petrified. I had heard before that animals could see spirits but I had never really looked into it. The chair jerked suddenly as if someone had stood up and I stared at Da Vinci as he lifted his gaze until he appeared to be looking about six feet off the ground. Slowly Da Vinci moved his head as if he was watching someone walk across the room, he whimpered and backed away from whatever it was. Finally he stopped at I noticed that his attention was now focused on the picture of my deceased great uncle which hung on the wall.

After a few more seconds Da Vinci bolted it up the stairs into my room with his tail between his legs and I ran after him without a second’s hesitation. Once we were safely in my room Da Vinci was still visibly shaken and I spent the following hours trying to comfort him.

The next day I asked my dad what he knew about the rocking chair. He told me that it had been passed down from one of his relatives, I asked him which one and he exclaimed “Why it was your Great Uncle Mike!” and he turned and pointed to the picture on the wall which Da Vinci had been starring at petrified the night before. I stared at the picture in shock and I noticed to my dismay that in the picture my great uncle had been sitting in that very chair. After seeing my reaction my dad looked at me puzzled and then something seemed to fall into place for him and he told me to have a seat. He then asked me in a hushed voice if I had ever felt anything strange about the chair and when I nodded he asked me if I had ever seen it move on its own and when I hesitantly nodded again he exhaled loudly and said he sure was glad that he wasn't the only one. He told me that he thought his mind had been playing tricks on him but he guessed that his uncle just wanted to watch over his family.

This tale form the family's collection is about the time my newly-wed parents and their toddler went to pay respects for my long-dead grandfather, may his rest be peaceful. They drove quite a ways out of town to the plot outside Alamogordo, at least I recall it being there. My cursed father wished to visit the grave of his father in respect with his new bride and son. So we left for the graveyard. We arrive and get out of the car, and my toddler self disappears with no trace.

They looked for a while and they eventually began to hear jubilant screeches and giggles. They eventually found me laughing and having quite a time.

They're very similar but some have slight differences.

My background: I'm a 27 year old Australian, who is currently living in Jakarta, Indonesia. I've been here for a year, but had an interest in Indonesian spirit beliefs for some time now.

**Pocong**
*The c is pronounced ch so it sounds like Pochong*

A Pocong is a spirit of a person whose soul cannot leave the earthly realm.
In Islamic traditions when a person dies their body is wrapped in a shroud with the arms, legs, neck and top of head tied together. In some places the body is left like this so people can pay their respects before burial.
It's believed that the soul of the person inhabits this world for 40 days after death before moving on and if the knot at the top of the head isn't undone the body jumps from the grave and hops around to warn people that the knot is still tied.
The spirit doesn't do anything except hop around (as it's legs are still tied) and is relatively harmless, except for scaring the crap out of you. It's popularised by the ""hop hop hop"" sound that it makes as it moves.
There is also a belief that the pocong can appear from place to place. One story that was related to me had the person closing and opening his eyes, each time the pocong appeared closer to him
 
The 2000's was booming business for Pocong with many films and tv shows being released, most notably was Pocong (2006) which was banned in Indonesia for being ""too scary"" (I have been told that during production actual spirits were caught on film which is the real reason for the ban)
The popular culture version of pocong involves it being under the control of a black magician trying to get revenge on someone who has either wronged him, or he has been paid to do it.

**Friend of a Friend Encounter**

One story I've been told by a friend involves a friend he knew. A group of them were staying in an old dormitory due to work training. 
This friend is Balinese (who are 'known' to be very spiritually open) and one night while everyone was sleeping he woke up and needed to use the bathroom, but he saw a pocong at the end of the room. He closed his eyes and opened them again, and it had moved, this time closer to him. Each time he closed and opened his eyes it would be closer and closer, appearing in between the beds of the dorm. He opened his eyes one more time and it was next to the bed opposite him.
He closed them one final time and waited several minutes before deciding he really needed to use the bathroom.
Opening his eyes he saw the empty room. With a bit of relief he headed out the hall very timidly keeping an eye out for the pocong, but it wasn't anywhere to be found.
Reaching the bathroom, he opened the door only to see it standing there, staring at him.
Scared he screamed and shut the door. He opened it a few minutes later but it was gone.

**Kuntilanak**
*Also known as Pontianak*

Kuntilanak is the spirit of a woman who died while pregnant. As with many spirits, she is believed to be a reasonably attractive pale woman with long black hair and wearing a simple white gown that may or may not have blood stains on it.
I've heard three different stories behind Kuntilanak, in all three she lives in a tree (traditionally a banana tree, but not always so) and you can hear her high pitched laugh at night (some say baby cries, but both are similar) the differences lay in what she does.

The first tales involve her coming down and kidnapping children to feed on.
Which sounds like a tale told by mothers to children to keep them inside at night time.

The second tales are about her bewitching men and killing them by ripping open their stomachs and feasting on the insides.
Either because the man stumbled across one, or because of a woman scorned wanting revenge.
A lot more graphic than the children’s stories...

The first two tales seem to share a lot in common with the Malay version of Pontianak, but as with many of these tales all stories tend to come together and merge until it's hard to separate the spirits.

The third types of tales are similar to vampire stories that it is able to transform into a bird and fly, and it drinks the blood of virgins and young women.
It sounds like a tale told to keep young ""innocent"" people inside away from the dangers out.

The kuntilanak is known for its laughter/cries coming from the tree it's in. If the sound is loud it means it is far away, but if it is very quiet it means it is close.

Although not common I have heard of stories about people becoming possed by a kuntilanak spirit, though I'm not convinced it is a kuntilanak but another spirit.
In one story, a male was possessed by the spirit of a kuntilanak and half of his face which was in shadows took on a feminine appearance complete with a red eye. Although I was told it was a kuntilanak, I believe it was a lang suir, who is known to have red eyes.

There is a childrens rhyme that you can sing to summon a kuntilanak if you desire.

*Protection*
It's believed that if a pregnant woman carries a nail, a knife or scissors while traveling, she will be protected from the kuntilanak.

*Differences*
The Malay Pontianak has a hole in her back and if it is plugged up she will become a normal woman, who is able to live a normal life. If the hole is unplugged she will return to her killing ways.
There is a spirit in Indonesia named *sundel bolong* which translates to *prostitute with a hole in her* who is a woman who died while pregnant and gave birth from the grave, or while giving childbirth and the baby was cut from her back.

There is so much public superstition about these spirits that recently a tree said to be home to a kuntilanak was cut down. Article [here](http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/ghost-sightings-spark-scenes-of-hysteria-in-indonesian-capital/482256)

When it started, I was in bed after reading my kids a story and she was in the other bedroom putting up some washing and we both heard a very loud thumping in the other room.  She came in very afraid, I had blown it off as the neighbours above us being very loud.  She claimed it was our kids rocking horse which I got up and checked on.  It seemed normal and I rocked it just to see and heard the very same thump sound, did a couple more times to be sure.  Put it in our other bedroom and closed the door and told the wife it was probably just the neighbours.

Now every night(why is it always at night?) I keep hearing strange things in the main room.  And this morning took the cake, I get up very early and was on my notebook(all the lights off to not disturb everyone else who is still asleep) and then start hearing my kids toys.  Notably my son's favourite toy car being pushed along the floor.  I had blindness due to the darkness and staring at the bright screen so I didn't see anything but I couldn't ignore it so I got up and turned on the light.  Note: it stopped the second I stood up and I didn't see anything once the light was on(everything looked ""normal"" and I didn't see the car out.)  Went back to browsing morning news and didn't hear anything else.

Just like to note, this isn't the first time something strange has happened at my house.  But, the last occurance before these was about 3 years ago(I made a post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/r7tt4/mefam_experiences_with_something_in_bedroom/) about that.)

But my bedroom door loves closing by itself. Thing is, I usually have my windows closed so there's no draft that's blowing through the apartment to make it do what it does. I've examined the hinges and I still have no clue as to why it does that. Ever since I moved into my new apartment 6 months ago, this has been the case. Recently, my bedroom door tends to stay open long enough for me to take a quick grab for something in the kitchen and head right back in (like it's anticipating my return). It'll only start closing once I'm already back in the room.

On the other hand, my bathroom door likes to open by itself. I tend to leave it wide open, since it always freaks me out when I have to go to the bathroom late at night (door not quite closed, but nearly there) and the door opens all the way as if to let me through.

seems like i have myself a polite poltergeist.

1319596268.0,28,self.Thetruthishere,lp7ph,[PI] Why I Don't Play With Ouija Boards Anymore,Ethosia,42,14,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/lp7ph/pi_why_i_dont_play_with_ouija_boards_anymore/,"About 18 months ago I was in Mobile, Alabama with my girlfriend, we'll call her Katie. On a whim I bought a new Ouija board from a bookstore. Taking it to a friends house, we decided to try it out. Surprisingly, it worked very well when her and I used it together. We had several conversations with different spirits, one was a soldier killed in WW2, one was a small girl who claimed her father locked her in a barn and burned it down. Every conversation would turn suddenly from polite and inquisitive banter, and the spirit would suddenly interject with ""HE WILL KILL HER"" or ""SHE WILL DIE"". When we asked who would kill whom, we found that her ex-boyfriend (baby's daddy) would be the murderer. This really freaked her out. And we stopped playing for the night. 

(She's still alive to this day, however she's still living in the same town. Soon she's supposed to report to court over custody of her child. So who knows what will happen...)

The next night, we decided to explore an abandoned sanitarium (insane asylum) across town. This was a favorite ""creepy"" spot of the local teenagers. This was a huge campus, guarded by high barbed wire fences and said to have a roaming guard accompanied with a dog due to gangs causing trouble there. 

[Location of the sanitarium on google maps](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.671203,-88.218367&amp;ll=30.671134,-88.219091&amp;spn=0.001735,0.004128&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;z=19&amp;layer=t&amp;lci=com.panoramio.all,com.youtube.all,org.wikipedia.en)

There were 3 of us altogether, Katie, a friend (we'll call him Chris, and I. As we walked to the gate we could see the asylum looming in the darkness. We became filled with dread, and a kind of buzzing grim excitement began building within us. As we drew closer, past the gate, I could actually feel a sensation like the air was charged with electricity.
""Can you feel it?"" Katie asked me. ""Moon really likes it here, she wants to come out."" Moon is the name for Katie's alternate personality. She's had a rough life, very poor, had some trauma in her life. Her mind is not 100%. I'd met ""Moon"" before, it was quite interesting to meet someone who is very different yet sharing the body of someone you know. I believe it is due to this weak point in her psyche which led to the events of that night. 

We cautiously walk up the gravel hill, making our way only by the light of the moon. We reach the first building in no time, the door is off the hinges, it is a two story building. Not very big, and definitely not the main facility which was like a fortress. Wanting to explore everything, we duck inside. It is a large open room, everything made of wood. Dark inside but we could see by the moonlight streaming thru the boarded up windows and the open door. There was a pile of what looked like burned furniture strewn across the floor. There was a wooden staircase leading up to the balcony, and Katie walked over to it. She stood at the base of the stairs looking up at the top, then she so very slowly stepped up, then again. The stood waiting at the second step, looking up, silent. Suddenly she fell backwards as if someone shoved her off the staircase. I rushed over to pick her up, and she asked ""Did you see that?"" 
""See what?"" I asked. 
""There was a woman in a long white dress at the top of the staircase. She waved at me to come up, but I didn't want to. So she pushed me.""
I didn't know what to think of this. Chris was turning into a scaredycat, and wanted to leave just as soon as we got there. But I pulled the ouija board from under my arm, and righted a small wooden table. We sat crosslegged around it, and I set up the board. I think we played with the light of my phone, just me and Katie. Chris was too frightened. 
""Is anyone here?"" I asked, my trembling fingers lightly resting on the planchette. It quickly slid to ""YES"". 
""What is your name?"" I asked.
Katie then said, ""Sarah.""
I looked up, wide eyed, my heart stopped. ""...are you sarah?"" However she didn't answer. Only returned my cold stare.
""They see you...."" She spoke in taunting, sing-song manner like a child. ""They want to come out and play..."" She kept repeating these two lines, not responding to what we were saying. 
At this point Chris was losing his mind and asked, ""Should I kill her?"" 
I wanted to stay, and explore the rest of the campus, however he pleaded with me to leave with him. So I packed up the board, and led Katie/Sarah out the door. 
As we walked down the hill Sarah/Katie said, ""I've never been this far before, we're not supposed to leave!"" And then she began to sing a song I've never heard, it didn't come from this world. It was set to the tune of a child's nursery song. However the lyrics were twisted. I could only hear a few words here and there, ""play things...satans wings...."" 
I stared at her, mouth agape. We rushed to the gate, and as we crossed over, she suddenly snapped out of it, looking around as if she didn't know where she was. I asked her if she remembered anything of what happened, she said no. Katie was back, she remembered NOTHING after setting her fingers on the planchette. We walked as fast as we could back to our cars, our faces white and hearts pounding. As the ghostly fortress shrunk from view in the rear view mirror, warmth began to creep back into my body. We were safe.

1317663230.0,27,self.Thetruthishere,kzjki,[ME:] Ceremonies,littlegoth,33,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kzjki/me_ceremonies/,"I'll start out with letting you know that while I am a traditional Native American woman, the Ceremony that I was involved in was not that of my tribe or culture, but a separate tribe. To respect them, I will be leaving some things out.

When I was a teenager, my mom had this knack for finding spiritual people, (some would call them ""Holy Men"" or ""Shaman"") from other tribes. They would always be invited to stay in our house, sometimes they lived with us for months, others only a few days, then they'd generally disappear with not so much as a goodbye.

One of the men was probably as oily as you could imagine. He was a short stocky man who wore a beret covered in pins and ""AIM"" buttons. He took us up to the Menominee Reservation to do a ceremony. There were tons of rules like no metal on your person and no moving from your seat, no matter what you hear, feel, or see. Once the room is settled and things are underway, he would be tied up, wrapped in a blanket, then tied up again, the lights would be turned off, leaving us in darkness and he would begin singing.

Eventually his voice wouldn't be muffled and you could hear him moving around the pitch black room. Shuffling sounds, the sound of moccasins on concrete basement floors (but that wasn't him, he wore these ratty black sneakers). Things brushing against your feet or tugging on your hair. Then it'd be over and your hair would be undone, the hair tie gone because it had a metal bit holding it together, or you'd find something else tucked between yourself and your cushion, money or stones or something. More of the wrapping up of things, being forced to eat raw kidney (it's been more than 15 years and I can remember the taste and texture of that... gag)

Mom tells him he has to do another one closer to home, so he comes home with us and she spends over two weeks getting things arranged to go through this again.

When the time comes, it's a cold December night, and we're hauled off to this place that looks like a funeral home, but I think it was an art gallery or something. We're taken down to the basement and given cushions to sit on. The beginning to this ceremony is a bit different. Less Menominee and Ojibwe, but instead lots of other tribes. Blood sacrifice happens, both women and men getting cut and offering up their blood, other gifts are placed before the man as well. He is bound, blanketed, and bound again, the lights are off and he starts singing. I hear the sound of rope popping and blankets ripping. I hear the song grow louder. I hear quiet, non-human, whispers from all around me. He sings even louder. I hear shuffling feet on stone - impossible due to this floor being carpeted. I hear a click and look up toward the only light in the room, a small rectangular window near the ceiling, more than 8 feet from the floor. That's when I see something strange. It looked like a dog's head on a person's body. I could see well muscled shoulders and the long canine snout and perky ears. The only way I could describe what I saw was 'It looked like Anubis.'

The creature was facing the Medicine Man. I was probably only a foot or so from where its feet were, but I couldn't move. I sat there, staring up at it as it moved from the small square of dim light, into the deep darkness of the basement, stalking to where the man sat singing. For a bit, the outline seemed to glow in the blackness, but then it faded. There was a heavy thunk sound, the song stopped, and the lights were turned on suddenly.

The sacrifices were gone, the small 'bowl' of blood, the medicines, and the trinkets. The blanket was missing a large swath from it, and the rope was gone completely. The man looked as if he had aged a few years in the hour or so he spent singing.

We went home that night, and the guy fell asleep in the car. We woke him up and got him inside and to his bed. The next day, by the time I woke up, the Medicine man was gone.  He left behind a few of his pins and buttons and his razor.

I was about three or four or five. I can’t really remember how old I was exactly. But I know it was around there because I wasn’t at school yet. I think my little sister was born by then. She is four years younger than me so if she was then she was a baby at the time. If not then I was younger.

I used to play with some of the kids from the other floors. We’d be outside or I’d be at theirs. So if I was gone my parents would know I was nearby.

I was never allowed to be left in the house alone. My parents would always take me with them if they were going to the shops. One particular day I hid somewhere in the house – I don’t remember where – until they left to get groceries. As the door slammed I remember getting excited at this new-found liberty.

I wasn’t alone in the house long. I literally felt uncomfortable a few seconds after emerging from my hiding place. It was like the moment my parents were gone something sensed my vulnerability. I remember staring at my shadow in the corridor and finding it odd for some reason. I wasn’t afraid at this point. But I still couldn’t figure why I found it weird. Another strange feeling came over me and I lifted my arm as some kind of test. I remember watching the shadow stay put. It didn’t lift its arm with me - It wasn’t my shadow.

An overwhelming sensation came over me - that whatever was in front of me was watching me, and had been the entire time. I screamed and just ran. I scrabbled for the lock then burst out the door towards my parents who had hardly even crossed the street by this point. Right into their arms. I bawled at them and they were laughing. Aw, we left him in the house, etc.

For some reason I never told them. I never even thought to. I don’t remember ever thinking about it again after the incident. And the shadow never came back. It was almost as though it left because of my reaction. As time went on I forgot about it. It was only when reading hobertbateson’s thread about multiple shadow people that it came back to me. The memory has always been in the back of my mind. But it’s only now that I’ve thought about it clearly. I wonder if it was malevolent, or if it was protecting me and I misinterpreted it. Either way I think I scared it off. Either that or it’s become much better at not being seen.",,False,,t5_2sntx,True,,,True,t3_kx6fb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kx6fb/me_a_watching_shadow_xpost_from_nosleep/,
1317109628.0,27,self.Thetruthishere,ksqqn,I'm part of a ghost hunting team: Here are my experiences.,darkangelle,32,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ksqqn/im_part_of_a_ghost_hunting_team_here_are_my/,"As the title states, I've been part of a ghost hunting team for about 8 months now. I've been to 7 'hunts' and the experiences have been amazing.  
  

I'll start with a little background on myself. I've been interested in the paranormal since early childhood. It has never scared me, it simply intrigues me. I have wanted to participate in Ghost Hunting since I was very young. I wanted *proof* that these things were real. After being on the trips, I have encountered many different and chilling things but, I remain on my middle ground. I believe there is definitely something after we die but I cannot even fathom the reasons of it. It's enthralling and scary; it makes my adrenaline pump and I love it.  
  
  
I had a hard time finding a group, until one day I did and I told my boyfriend to email them and ask if they would accept new members or tag-alongs. To our surprise, he did. We maintained email and facebook communication until his next trip and we were invited.  
  
  
We live in Puerto Rico and this first trip was to a local Indigenous Ceremonial Park. It dates back to around 500AC, if I remember correctly from the information. It's basically a clearing marked with stones that form ballparks where these Pre-Taino Indians played. It's a very beautiful place but even during daylight hours, you can *feel* there's something all around you. It plays tricks on you; it jumps from tree to tree, hiding.    
  

On this day, we set up 4 cameras on certain spots and for the rest of the night, we used 2 hand-held cameras and our only lights were 3 flashlights. Now, as I said, this place is eerie during the day but it's spacious and beautiful, at night? It becomes suffocatingly dark and creepy, it feels much, much smaller.  
During the day, there's *always* something just outside your field of vision, jumping and dancing through the tree trunks. The more you try to directly look at it, the faster it moves. We all see it as a white shadow that blurs by us. Sometimes the shadows would come *very* uncomfortably close to us (I was touched and attacked on one of our outings, but more on that later) and even touches us.    
  

As the night wore on, we would stand in the middle of each circle and ask questions out loud. We also wrote down indigenous words and would call them out from time to time. We could all hear rhythmic drumming, farther off into the distance; also: Indian Battle-cries. Yes, the typical hand-tapping-over-mouth-while-screaming type of battle-cry. The thing that gets to me is that, within a group of 9 people, *all* of us heard every sound and all described it the same way. At one point during the night, we split into 2 teams, one team was left at ""basecamp"" (an area outside of the park) and the rest of us went back to keep exploring. During the first 15 minutes, we began to hear music and battle-cries. It would first appear to come from one direction, but when we'd move to that spot, it would suddenly be *behind us*. It had us going in circles. We had walkie-talkies and we radio'ed basecamp:  
""Are you guys screaming, talking or making any noise??""  
*""No, we aren't... We heard some screaming, we thought it was you guys...""*  

At that point, everyone was very excited. Scared but excited. We decided to go and stand (again) in the middle of a park (there's about 6 or 7 rock-outlined areas) and turn off everything. As we stood there, most of us could feel a static-type energy touching our hands and arms. It literally felt like soft static bolts, the kind you get after dragging your sock'ed feet on the carpet and touching metal.  
  
  
We sat down on the large rocks and remained silent. Soon after, we began to feel *tugs* and *caresses* on our bodies and clothing. My boyfriend was sitting next to a (very rattled) me and he suddenly got up, and paced around slowly. He didn't say a word but I knew something was wrong. (When I asked him later that night, He told me that while we were sitting there, he felt a hand caress the back of his neck and up to his hair. I could understand why he felt unnerved).  
  
While sitting in this spot, we looked off into the other parks and clearings adjacent to where we were. At the same time, we all saw a large, white misty-shadow zooming between the trees that were no more than 20 feet away. What makes it interesting is that it wasn't a constant. Every few minutes we'd see a new one in a new spot and all of us (as if on queue) would point it out. At this point, we were very rattled and got our shit and walked the 10 mns back to the basecamp to pack and go home. It seemed the longer we were there, the more brazen it got and we just didn't want to fuck around with whatever it was. It was obviously capable of touch and that was very unsettling.  
  

On our way home, boyfriend and I felt very bothered and uncomfortable. We hardly slept that night. Thankfully nothing followed us home but now we take some ""holy oil"" with us and mark ourselves with it. We aren't Christians but it seems to work for us. Wether its a placebo effect (it works because we *believe* it does) or a real thing, we don't know or care. As long as we feel safe from carrying back some of this...*energy* or w/e you'd like to call it, we're happy.  
  

Our Team Leader has most of our evidence but I do have a few pictures from that night, I will post them tomorrow as I'm writing this from my phone at the moment. He also has great audio recordings of a few sounds and disembodied voices, but I will have to find a way to get them from him, so no promises.  

Now, that time we heard the blood curdling scream and the giggles... I'll leave that for another day. It deserves it's own post.  
(I will post a map of the park and my pictures from the outing tomorrow, so look back for it!)

For the purposes of this story we'll call the one friend Matt and the other Joe, Matt being the one who told me the story and Joe being the home ""owner"".

Matt and Joe would often spend weekends at each other house during middle school/early High School, playing video games and watching movies.  Since Joe's room was too small for them both they'd often end up sleeping in the living room where ever they fell on the large L shaped sectional.  Joe pretty much slept here all the time so for him it was no change.

During the night Matt woke up to see a woman standing at the end of his leg of the sectional, by his feet.  Thinking it was just Joe's sister coming home and/or cutting through the living room he rolled over and went back to bed.  He awoke a bit later to see the person still standing there just watching him.  At this point he got a bit disturbed as he realized that A) it was not Joe's sister and B) she couldn't be standing where she was standing as there was a table there and then a wall.  He promptly hid under the covers, peeking out on ever so often to be greeted by her in the same position watching him.  Try as he might he could not wake up Joe, mostly because he was just a heavy sleeper who would shrug of most real attempts to wake him let alone the meager meeps and pokes Matt could muster.  This went on all night until at some point sleep got the better of him under the covers.

The next morning when sitting around for breakfast he relayed the story to Joe and his family, which had the color drain out of Joe's face and Joe's Dad laugh.  Other people have seen this woman and they have a pretty good idea who it is, namely the wife of the previous owner who died of cancer while on hospice in a back bedrooms;  the bedroom in question being Joe's.

Apparently Joe got tired of waking up and seeing her standing over him, or walking into his bedroom at night and seeing a hospital bed so he slept on the couch.  His reasoning, no one had seen her in that part of the house, which was a newer addition, added by his family after the purchased the house.

I was a bit skeptical but I have spoken with Joe directly on Facebook and he confirmed “he's telln ya the truth.”

Here's to this subreddit getting some legs!

----------------------------------
I was originally going to type this out at work, as I don't usually explore the paranormal from home. Well, not anymore anyway. Not after last time. I feel like I was taunting them, and I got what I deserved.

Ever since childhood I can recall pondering and questioning things. I was suspicious of the Santa Claus lie, so much that I actively worked to catch my parents setting the presents. I did. I was five. God was never a firmly-held belief, it was always more of a guilty feeling, something to fear. I am now an atheist and very scientifically inclined.

When I was in first grade my parents moved from Ottawa to El Salvador, my dad's birth country. We moved into this 3-bedroom two story house owned by my aunt. It had been build about five years previously, and the only occupier before that was my aunt. Before that, the land was a coffee grow. So, no real history, no one died there, as far as I'm aware.

I was young, so I was always afraid of going upstairs by myself. Once I would get to the top of the stairs, I would run towards the wall about 10 feet in front of me to flick the light switch. I always made sure I didn't look into the rooms before I did so. Once the light was on, I was safe. It took some work, but I finally got over my fear. This occurred by the time I was around 11, or 12.

It didn't last long. I am 21 years old now. I fear the dark.

THE SPIRAL AND THE LADY

First, sorry, but some background (as if there's not enough yet): As you enter my home, you will be in the living room. To your left is a bathroom, and some steps, which make a U-turn and go upstairs. To your right is the living room, ahead is the dining room, yard. As you get upstairs, ahead of you is a wall with the light switch, next to the bathroom door. To the right of you are two doors: The first is my sister's, the second mine and my brother's. To your left, and in front of my shared room, is my parent's room. Above you, about twelve feet high, is the ceiling. So from the spot where the stairs turn to go up, to the ceiling above, there is an 18 feet or so high gap. (clarification can be provided if requested)

The upstairs is the setting for the following story.

My first unusual experience in that house was very low-key. It would have gone unregistered and forgotten if it weren't for the fact that someone else saw it too. I was lying in bed, wide awake, listening to everyone in the house snoring in their deep slumber. I was looking at my parent's bedroom door, since my bed was facing it at the time. About four feet from the floor, on the door, was this faint, almost not there... Spiral. It would slowly wind into itself, disappear, then pop back into existence. Rinse and repeat. The entire process would take about five seconds. I remember thinking it was ""gathering"". I don't know what that means, but I do remember thinking that. I stared at it for a few minutes until I finally just shrugged it off and eventually found my sleep. You see, it was so damned faint that I could have believed it wasn't there. Plus, I didn't believe in ghosts and shit.

In the morning, while having cereal, I spoke of this weird faint spiral I saw. My sister immediately looks up and says ""Hey I saw it too!"". She's just my stupid little sister, I thought, seeking my attention. So I didn't give her any more clues: I told her to tell me what she saw, exactly. I vividly remember her tracing the pattern of the spiral in the air, while she was telling where it was, and how it faded into itself before popping back to existence.

But after she confirmed my sighting, I recall finding it strange but not scary. I now have this theory that, had I stayed up, I would have lost my mind that night. I don't know why, but I feel like that was the lady, gathering energy or something. I don't fucking know. But this is where the mildness ends.

Fast forward to about a year later.

For some reason I kept waking up every night for about two weeks now. It was always at a time when everyone was asleep. I would just wake up, and be wide awake for like felt like hours before falling back to sleep. It was one of these nights, and I was wide awake. We had rearranged our room, so that my bed was against the wall next to the bathroom, so I had a diagonal view of the hallway and the top of the stairs. I turned left while lying down, and when I did, I caught something white on the corner of my eye. I turned to look at it and saw a white, long shape floating about two feet below the ceiling, high up above the steps. My first reaction was to look away, to face the wall. Then my mind immediately got to work: What the fuck was that? I remember trying to figure out what it could be. But I could not find a reasonable explanation. I knew my house well. And I knew there was nothing that looked remotely like it anywhere around. There was a window nearby, but it was facing the wrong way. And anyway, it doesn't fucking matter, because my inquisitive (stupid) little mind told me I had to find out what it was. So I sat up, leaned forward and stared.

It was a fucking lady.

As my mind processed the details my body tightened and my brain attempted to jump out of my skull. My eyes burned every fucking horrible detail into the back of my skull, so I can handily keep it with me until my death. She was facing the wall. Her hair was long, almost down to her waist. Her dress was gown-like. Her feet were floating... angled downwards, with slipper-like shoes.

I am being 100% honest. I don't want to keep writing about it. I almost had a panic attack. It's been a while. I think you got the idea. Nothing much happened after anyway, just the details... I don't like the details.

If I didn't bore you all to death I could write the next chapter about the taunting and why I cannot deny, should never deny, that other things exist...

Conclusion to this story, and Part 2: THE DOOR, THE CREEPING DOUBT, AND REASSURANCE

EDIT: Wow 40+ votes already! Thanks guys. I seriously thought I was boring you all to death. Gimme like eight hours, and I'll see if I can fire up another thread full of stories that people told me. No guarantees. Might have to wait till tomorrow, since I'll be home alone later tonight, and I'm not fucking around here when that happens.

A REQUEST

But wait, there's more! I don't have any video proof or anything, but if you wish to look at something very similar to the lady (but without the horrible details), try searching for ""Junkyard ghost"". It's a video I saw on the news a few months after which made me SCREAM when I saw it. It's just surveillance footage of this white figure floating around this car... The car was wrecked earlier that day and some lady died. Look at it at your own discretion, because I will admit that I think that video is real. Let me know if you find it, I'll put the link up here.

The summer of 2011 found me homeless. I moved back to my hometown, a small town of 9000 I will add. Had moved back temproarily found myself living in a cemetery. In an open sepulchre built into the side of a hill. I had decided to stay there because it was realativly temperate. Shelter from the hot summer sun. And really quite beautiful in and of itself. This particular sepulchre was not a family tomb it had as I would learn with some minor research been used in its day as an area to store the coffins before they were inturned. The back of the concrete structure had all these rusted metal rods in a grid pattern from floor to ceiling which I guess were used as storage for the various coffins. The inscription above the entrance read ""receiving"" 1891. A friend of mine had speculated that this structure had something to do with thwarting would be grave robbers. Not sure if there is any truth to that.

For the most part I felt very safe and isolated in a good way. However Toward the end of the second week I started getting eerie feelings. The reason I am posting this is to share the odd occurance that made my decision to leave. It was fairly late one night.  I heard distinctly a male voice coming from what sounded like the top of the hill/tomb. I remember it said something about an animal. I was worried it was the groundskeeper so I investigated but found nobody there. Returned to my sleeping bag. I continued to keep getting more and more uneasy kept sencing movement in the tomb. Eventually I shone my flashlight on someting. .which looked like a little pile of dirt as my eyes focused I realized it was a frog. I was fairly near a swamp so I was not surprized to see the critter. I stood up and was going to let it outside when my flashlight caught another. .then another and another. As I looked around me I was shocked to see that there were 20 to 30 frogs all just sitting there in an unnatural silence. I had never noticed them prior to this night. I felt somehow that this was the spirits way of letting me know that I was no longer welcome in the tomb. So I respectfully gathered my few effects and left before sunrise. Just wanted to share. Not sure if that was paranormal or not but it felt like it at the time. Has anyone else heard of frogs in relation to spirits or entities?

I live in south-central Florida near a river and swampy areas. My neighborhood is also a bit more on the rural side and there are two large canals that run through my neighborhood. 

One night at about 9, I was driving home down my street. The street has speed bumps which get pretty annoying since you have to slow down to about 15 mph. As I was coming up to one of the speed bumps that is right before a canal, I just happened to see something out of the corner of my eye. 

In the driveway just before the speed bump, there was a thing. I don't even know how else to describe it other than as a ""swamp monster"". It looked kind of like cousin it except instead of hair, it was covered in vines and plants. It was about 5 feet tall or so, I just know it wasn't the height of a person unless they were really short. 

I did a double take as I drive past it to make sure I wasn't just seeing things, and as I looked back, it started to walk towards the canal (the house/driveway it was at was right next to the canal). 

As soon as I got home, I called my next door neighbor and he just laughed at me and told me I'd be fine. 
Pretty much everyone I've told about this just said that it was probably someone in a gilly suit, but I know it wasn't because 1. Why would someone randomly be walking around in a gilly suit at that time? and 2. It honestly did not look like a gilly suit to me at all.

I've been lurking for the past few weeks and I want to share something that happened very recently to me. I'm normally a balance between skeptic and open-minded. I'm open to the possibility of the paranormal, but I like to dissect any event and try all possible rational explanations before I can conclude something is supernatural.


I have no way to prove this story, but I'll be happy to answer any questions or requests for more details. Last year in January my grandmother was diagnosed with uterine cancer stage 4 and she was given at most a year to live. My sister and I live abroad and we were updated over the phone mostly.


My parents decided to start her on radiation therapy, knowing well in advance that there was little hope for her. By October of that year she was very weak, and soon she moved with my parents. By December she is really sick, and bedridden mostly. My parents hire a nurse to help take care of her. By May she barely talks, and the doctor starts giving her morphine. By this point I had made peace that she had lived a long fulfilling life and I'm very content and prepared for her death.


The Friday before mother's day, I was staying over at my boyfriend's apartment. We go to bed at around 11pm. I wasn't really thinking about my grandmother or my parents. In the middle of the night, I suddenly wake up and I know she has passed away. It's hard to explain, but this thought was just in my head ""my grandmother has passed away."" I looked at the clock and it's 4:05am. I feel this really unexpected but very pleasant feeling of peace and calm. This lasted probably 30 seconds, and I went right back to sleep. 


My boyfriend and I wake up the next morning and I immediately go check my cellphone because I knew what was coming. I read a text from my dad that says ""You're grandmother passed away at 4am. Your mom is doing ok.""  I called my dad and explain to him that I knew she passed away because I felt it last night. They are a little confused and honestly so was I because I couldn't explain it. I was very happy for some reason, because I was not really close to my grandmother but I thought it was nice that she came to tell me she was gone and that she was happy.



I will update this post soon with my sister's story. She actually was very close to my grandmother and claims to have seen her in a dream that night.


**UPDATE**: Here is my sister's story. Just some background info. She was a junior in college when this happened. My grandmother and her were super super close.

&gt;The day grandma passed away, I was really sad thinking about how I wasn't with her and I didn't get a chance to say good bye. Two days after her death, I took a nap in the afternoon. While I was sleeping, I dreamed vividly that she opened the door of my dorm room and sat next to me. I was totally shocked, and I quickly realized that I was dreaming; however, I truly felt her presence was very real. While she was sitting on my bed, I hugged her and told her that I was sorry for not being there when she was in the last days of her life. I hugged her again and then she walked out of my dorm room. It was the most vivid and beautiful dream I have ever had.

It's very short, but I can ask her for more details if anyone wants to know more.

Alright, number 1: 
This happened when I was twelve or thirteen. I was laying in bed around 10:50 and I heard this whistling noise outside my window. I don't mean right outside my window, but like outside on the sidewalk. At first I simply assumed it was a neighbor whistling for their dog seeing as my neighbors on both sides of my house had dogs, but it started happening every night at the exact same time. I still wrote it off as a neighbor whistling for their dog for quite some time until my family went on a little vacation to [Salishan Resort](http://www.salishan.com/) on the Oregon coast. 10:50 PM what do you know? The same whistling. Also, to clarify it wasn't ever the kind of whistling typical of people calling their dogs, it was a slower more drawn out whistle last 6 or 7 seconds. This is also the first time I have ever told anyone about this... For some reason I just always felt like I shouldn't. 

Number 2:
This happened to my mother actually, not me. When my mother was a girl she and her sister had rooms that shared a wall. They developed a code, where they would knock on the wall, and each knock indicated a letter in the alphabet; example: A=1 knock, Z=26 knocks. Her mom died from lung cancer when she was probably 10-11. The night her mom died she heard knocking on the wall from her sister's side, but it went way past 26, or spelled out nonsense. Eventually it stopped and she went to bed. The next day, she asked her sister what she was doing, and she said it wasn't her, and that she thought it had been my mom. My mom knew that her mother knew about their code, but didn't know enough about it to actually use it, so to this day she thinks it was her mom trying to playfully say goodbye the night she died.

I also had an incredibly disturbing dream that sort of ties in to real life creepitude, but since the rules say no dream posts, I omitted it.

Those who do not, that's fine. Just take this as this is what I BELIEVE I experienced, or what I interpreted it as. 

When I was between the ages of 2 and about 6 my mother would lay me down for a nap of an hour and a half, or two hours. 

When I think back on these years, the most vivid of these memories are the strangest. I remember these naps, I remember lying on my bed (a bunk bed) and I remember ""falling"" off the bed, and hovering above the floor. These are probably the happiest memories I have, because even thinking back on them I have a sense of the extreme joy and peace I felt then. This would happen almost every day, and occasionally I'd ""float"" around the room, or down the stairs, but I never left the house. I'd tell my mother, and she'd say something like ""sounds like a lovely dream!""

I felt almost angry when she'd say that, and insist it was real and felt real. Even now I can't help but believe I did have an experience. 

Weirdest of all, I remember my younger sister (three years younger than me) asking me at age 7 if I could float too. I asked her what she meant, and she described the same thing to me. At the wise old age of 10, of course, I had no idea what it meant and just assumed that we were blessed with the gift of flight, probably by fairies living at the bottom of the garden. 

Last year I stumbled across something about Astral Projection online, and realized that both out experiences match up to most people's OBE descriptions. Also, some claim that they're easier to achieve in Childhood.

Before now, I’ve posted this story on r/nosleep and I’ve talked about it on r/paranormal. There are a few follow-up stories as well that I’ll post if people show interest in this story. You should know when reading this that I am a writer. I write creepypasta and similar stories, but this story is a relaying of a real-life event. Feel free to comment, criticize, etc. I have no firm beliefs about what actually happened this night; I am only going to relay the factual events that I witnessed. I welcome any and all input and thoughts. That being said, I ramble a bit. Sorry. I am not in any way traumatized by this event, so don’t feel like you have to censor yourself. This happened about four years ago. I was about 15 or 16 years old when this happened.

This story in particular is about an Ouija board. In high school, my friend Kim would tell me about how she would do the Ouija board with her sister and contact all types of spirits. I was raised Catholic and I had a very strong belief in spirits until I was about 13 years old. At this age, I had a loss of faith and I identified as an atheist or an agnostic, depending on my mood. Along with God, I also lost my belief in many paranormal phenomenon, including spirits. Hearing my friend make such a bold claim, however, was interesting, and my reaction to her story was basically “Prove it.” My friend Raphael (Raph for short) was also interested to see this business, so he offered his house as a place for us to try Kim’s Ouija board. 

One night when Raph's mom went out, Kim and I arrived with a couple other friends and her Ouija board. This was a typical toy store Ouija board, with a “yes,” a “no,” the digits 0-9, all the letters of the alphabet, a “goodbye” space, and the fancy pictures in the corners. It basically looked like [this](http://www.brainjar.com/dhtml/ouija/graphics/board.jpg). 

We went up to Raph’s attic, which was pretty creepy, as I suspect most attics are. The floors were made of a creaky wood that constantly made us think someone/something was walking when it was really just one of us adjusting for comfort. The only thing stored in the attic was a large, dusty, ornate mirror. Raph tells me that he hangs out in his attic a lot, and he apparently wrote the word ""hi"" in the dust of the mirror. Even knowing that he did it, it was still pretty creepy. I sat with my back to the mirror because I didn't want to look at it. I will try to get a picture of his attic if I can and post it in an update just for clarification.
Anyway, we broke out the Ouija board, and Kim went on to explain several rules about how to ""properly"" use the board. She said that we should stop the oracle if it started making figure 8’s or if it tried to travel to all four corners of the board. This, she said, meant that the spirit was trying to escape the board. She warned against pressing too hard on the oracle. Finally, she said to be respectful to the spirits. She had brought candles, salt, and a silver cross with her. Raph and I did not care too much about the rules of the board. Raph actually broke out a bottle of gin he had managed to find while she was explaining and started pouring him and myself shots. By the end of the night, I had put down over half of the bottle of gin myself, and this may account for some of the fuzziness I have in regard to the details of that night. Oh, it was also raining that night. Sound like a horror movie yet?

Now, as I said earlier, I am only reporting the facts of what happened. When I talk about whatever it is that we were talking to through the board, I am going to refer to it as the “contact,” unless it gave us a specific name with which to address it. I’m not going to call it a spirit because, honestly, I’m very skeptical about paranormal claims. It is what it is regardless of what I believe, but for our purposes here, it is “the contact.”

After about five minutes, we got a contact. As a side note, this was my first Ouija session, so I did not know what to expect. Also, I have never had an inactive Ouija session; we always make some kind of contact fairly quickly. Anyway, we made a contact. I honestly do not remember this contact, so it must not have been very important. All I do remember is that all of our friends were excitedly asking questions while Raph and I did shots and tried to guess who was moving the oracle. After that contact, we made another which was equally uninteresting. When our group was finished with the second contact, Raph and I interrupted the session. “Let us hold the oracle,” I said, “and we’ll see what happens.” As expected, when Raph and I held the oracle and asked questions, nothing happened. The oracle did not even move slightly. I could tell Kim was getting a bit annoyed by this. She took the oracle back, claiming that Raph and I were not in the right frame of mind to attract a spirit willing to talk to us. She was partially right; I was pretty sauced, having drunk at least a third of the bottle at this point. 

The first two sessions did not stick in my memory. There is a reason the third one did. When we asked this third contact for its name, the oracle spelled out “ymzu.” For some reason, Kim asked the contact if there was something else it wanted to be called, and it replied “z.” Kim asked Z if its name referred to some kind of ending. Raph must have told his sisters that we were doing a Ouija board in the attic, because at that very moment, we heard a loud, high-pitched scream come from somewhere in the house. Raph unhitched the attic staircase and ran downstairs to find his sisters laughing. It was a pretty good prank; we were all shaken. Their timing was unfortunately impeccable. Anyway, once Raph came back up from yelling at his sisters, we continued the session. 

We talked to Z for a while. When asking Yes/No questions, we designated for Z that it should go to “0” if it wanted to give an answer of “I don’t know.” Z took full advantage of this, giving us the answer “0” quite often. We eventually came to the conclusion that Z did not have basic human emotions. Every time we asked it a question such as “Do you like talking to us?” or “Are you sad that you are dead?” it would respond with a “0.” Asking Z if it was human resulted in a “No,” but when we asked it what it was it once again gave us a “0.” Raph, getting a bit angry with Z, said “Come on! Do you even fucking exist?” to which it also responded “0.” At a certain point, Kim said that she could feel the room had grown colder, and a couple of friends immediately agreed. I told her that I didn’t think the room was any colder, but then again, I was drunk. I could tell that Kim was beginning to feel uneasy about Z, and so she asked Z if it was good or evil. As per usual, Z replied with a “0.” Kim began to tell us that she did not feel comfortable with Z anymore, and that she thought it was a demon or some type of evil trickster spirit. We decided to continue for a little while longer anyway. One thing I remember, looking back on the session, is that the longer we talked to Z, the faster the oracle would move when answering.

I think Raph was a little tipsy at this point, because he started saying belligerent things to Z. I was also being very sarcastic, saying things like “Don’t bother with this guy. He’s not even sure he exists.” Kim said that we shouldn’t say mean things to the board because if Z was an evil spirit than it could feed off of our negativity. She started to say something about how Raph and I attracted negative spirits. Raph has, for a few years now, studied a variety of spiritual practices with his father, and so I can only assume that led him to do what he did next. He announced that he was going to ask Z a question. He asked Z if it was an enlightened being. Z very quickly answered with a “Yes.” Raph then asked Z how it went about unlocking all of its chakras. Instead of spelling, as a contact usually does, it started moving between pictures on the Ouija board. Specifically, it moved between the picture of the sun on the top-left corner of the board and the picture of the woman with her hand on an oracle on the bottom-right corner of the board. Z moved quickly back and forth between these two images with increasing speed. It did this for a solid 10 seconds when Raph yelled “Alright, alright! Talk to sun! I get it! You can shut up now!”  I’m still not entirely clear on what all of that meant.

It was at this point that one of my other friends reminded Kim of one of her rules about not letting the oracle go to all four corners of the board. Kim asked Z if it was trying to escape from the board, and the oracle very bluntly moved to ""Yes."" ""That was stupid,"" I remember thinking, but that's what the hell happened. Kim went through some of her closing rituals, flipping the board and repeating some mantras. We had fun the rest of the night, and nothing else of notoriety happened that night.

Fast forward to the present - Raph and I have a much more vital interest in these things and we talk about things of this nature whenever we are together. Our friendship is different than most peoples' - it is a spiritual friendship. Due to the events of that night and some other events that I'll describe if you guys would like, Kim has refused to do anything of this nature with Raph and I ever again, still claiming that we attract negative spirits. Nobody else who was with us that night likes to talk about Z. I still talk to many of them regularly - one of them is actually my girlfriend - but whenever I mention Z they basically try to change the subject.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_185tnk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/185tnk/z_me/,

I have bad dreams often, and also have night terrors if I forget to take my thyroid medication (or if I'm pregnant). For those who may not know, the difference is that night terrors aren't actually a dream. It's the brain slipping a gear between REM cycles. You act like you're having a horrible nightmare, but you can't be woken and you don't remember it. It's more distressing for those around you than anything else.

There is one recurring dream that seems to overlap the two. I remember the dream, you see, but I freak out as much as when it's a night terror, and only realize it's happening when I've already leapt out of bed - the dream happens in an instant and has no sense of plot or duration. It's been happening for years. The past theory was it was just part of the whole night terrors thing, and that if it happened more than once in a week I should go get my levels tested to see if my hormones were off. 

I dream that there is an indistinct, faintly luminous white tendril-y cloud hovering above me and gently drifting down. It's actually kind of pretty, like jellyfish tentacles or gauze. However, whenever it happens, I have an immediate and violent GET THE FUCK OUT FROM UNDER IT reaction and flee the bed in terror, usually waking up in the hallway or kitchen gasping from adrenaline.

However, a few nights ago, my husband tells me that he heard our daughter stir and nudged me to go soothe her. I pointed straight up. He says that when he looked up, there was smoke over our bed, like the trails of smoke from a candle that's been pinched out. He says that while he looked at it, it disappeared, and I went to our daughter like a zombie. I don't remember this at all. I must have not fully woken up.

You guys, HE SAW IT. That freaks me out more than anything else. There might actually be something there. Worse, since I don't remember that instance, is it there often? Every night? Does it appear over my daughter? What is it? Has anybody heard of anything like this before?

It was bad, like to the point where they kicked him out of the house, said a whole bunch of mean, un-parent-like things, etc. I was driving home from the comic book store when i felt it. It felt like i was going into cardiac arrest almost... okay no, not as bad, but pretty close... my chest hurt and my heart was racing and all i could think about was him. i pulled over and called his phone. No answer. 

That was the second sign that something was wrong. This kid is like Mizuiro Kojima from Bleach: he ALWAYS has his phone. I called him again, and again still no answer.

Being the paranoid idiot that i am, i drove over to his neighborhood to find him hiding in his favorite spot, on top of the gazebo at the cemetery/park (i know, a weird combination, but it bust have sounded like a good idea at the time to the settlers). needless to say, he was crying his eyes out.

This happens all the time. So my question is: Does this happen to you? Care to share?

This morning, I went to the bathroom which is connected to one of the bedrooms. When I went was relieving myself, I heard a slam. I didn't really think anything of it since the walls are made of paper, so I assumed it was a neighbor's car door shutting or something like that. When I came out of the bathroom, the door to the bedroom was shut. I don't remember shutting it at all, I had no reason to. I was alone in the house at the time so why would I? Whatever, just laughed it off and texted the owner of the house, Steven, saying that it was haunted and he texted back saying it's probably true. Then, I let the dog out, going through the kitchen to the backdoor. I noticed how dark it was in there and I should probably turn on the light or open the blinds. After I let him in, the lights in the kitchen were on, and it wasn't me. So yeah, whatever. This place is haunted but nothing too serious, anybody else have any slightly haunted house stories?

This particular one wasn’t the most exciting, but it was the most interesting. The story is as follows:

""This was when your mother was still little and sweet. 

We had just finished moving into a new house. The last thing to be moved was an old Victorian-Craftsman-style mirror that your grandpa gave to me. It took two densely-built men to lift it into the house, and a third to help put it in place. 

We settled in and got comfy quickly after that.

While getting your mother ready for bed one night, I heard a heavy thud and glass shatter. I ran into the living room to find the mirror placed neatly on the floor, reflecting side up, unscratched and in one piece. 

Because the mirror was so heavy, we had to angle it in such a way that would have made it impossible to fall with the glass face up.  And the nail was placed too high up on the wall for such a heavy thing to fall and not break. 

We ran through every possibility, but found no solid explanation. The cord that had been holding it to the nail was not snapped, and the nail was still perfectly in place on the wall, completely un-shifted. The head of the nail was too wide and too thick for the cord to have been able to slip over it and fall. I knew no one could have moved it, either. Your mother was too little to reach it, let alone handle it without damaging it, and by that time your grandpa and I had already been divorced. The doors and windows were locked; I went around and checked myself.

We tossed the mirror out about two years after this instance, but up until then its random migrations off the wall continued. Some days we would come home to find it randomly sitting on the stairs, or lying on the kitchen table. Each time unscratched, with no explanation.”

1336728578.0,26,self.Thetruthishere,thycx,[FAM] Ruckus In Parents' Bedroom,focereal,26,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/thycx/fam_ruckus_in_parents_bedroom/,"It's a fact in our house that I'm prone to experiencing unexplainable and weird things. This left my family frustrated in many occasions, but it didn't mean I was the only one who experienced them. My older sister is a complete scaredycat when it comes to anything paranormal, most especially ghosts. She told me this story once a long time ago which we had a lengthy discussion about, but now she just diverts the conversation everytime I try to ask her about it. Apparently, our older brother was there, too, but he's deeply religious now and I'm scared he might give me a long winded lecture about cursed spirits or something. He's not the crazy, Bible thumping kind though, mind you.

First off, I should describe our house. It is an elongated bungalow, medium sized, with three bedrooms. The master bedroom is on the left side of the house [opposite the kitchen], and the other two rooms are to its right [across the living room]. The kitchen/dining room and livingroom are open floor space with only a huge tv storage unit dividing it in between. The walls are made of thick concrete creating an effective sound barrier for privacy. Even if you scream, it will be very hard to hear you, unless you shout through the slight gap beneath the door.

Well, my older brother, sister, and I just got back home from school that day, and were watching tv. Actually, I was passed out on the couch thus having no recollection of the incident. My sister said, at first, they heard a muffled sound coming from our parent's closed bedroom, as if someone was having a very loud conversation. That in itself was weird, but they didn't think much of it and ignored it. Then they heard a clear crashing sound like furniture falling to the floor followed by sounds of various items being thrown at the walls and at the door. This finally got them curious and concerned. She said our brother went to knock on the door but was left ignored. They thought our dad was probably having a meltdown since our mom passed away a few weeks earlier. No one has recovered from the loss yet so they huddled next to the couch and cried. But then they see our dad walk past the kitchen window, clearly busy doing backyard work. That's when they roadrunnered their way out of the house and told our dad what was going on inside his room. I think I should mention that those two turdnuts left me inside the house all by myself while they were safely next to our dad.

Our dad grabbed his machete and ran inside to check what was going on. I'm not sure if our dad heard the ruckus inside the room as well though. Anyway, my sister said he came back outside and asked which room they were talking about. They said master bedroom so our dad went around the house and peeked through its windows, but didn't see anyone inside nor did he hear anything. They were not really planning on going back inside [at least not for a while] since my older brother and sister were still hysterical, not until they [finally!] remembered I was still fast asleep on the couch. My sister said they found me still snoring away but now tuckered inside my favorite blanket that they swore was nowhere near me earlier.

My sister said it was probably our mom trying to get our attention. I don't remember much about her and her last days but supposedly she locked herself inside that room all the time when she was sick. Because she always had the door closed, we could never hear her call for us unless she throws something at the door like a shoe. I don't really know what or who it was that made the commotion, but I hope it wasn't our mom. I don't want her to be stuck in that room anymore.

Wow, typing this story just made me realize maybe my sister isn't scared at all of the incident but rather it's a touchy subject for her.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_thycx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/thycx/fam_ruckus_in_parents_bedroom/,

The happenings occurred at one of his friend's home, to him and others.  Basically this house is a hotspot for strange activities if you spend any length of time there you will experience something.  But, the owners(specifically the mother) refuses to do anything about it because she doesn't want to be viewed as crazy nor does she want the attention.

Some of things that have happened there:

1: Brother saw a lady he has never seen before in a hallway.  He alerts the family and is told to ignore it because it will ""go away"".

2: Brother heard people talking outside the window of the guest bedroom(the hotspot for weirdness).  But, cannot make out what is being said and actually goes outside to confront them and finds no one.

3: Brother is caressed and patted by something with cold hand while in bed.

4: Friend sees a ""black mist"" outside.  They ignore it until just to make sure they are not seeing things, asks their mother about it.  Her response is ""yes, I see it but I am just trying to ignore it"".

5: Friend's aunt is in from out of town and staying in the guest bedroom.  She is up reading a book with her daughter sleeping next to her.  She feels someone watching her and looks up to see ""eyes"" in the wall on the other side of the room.  She continues reading trying to play it off, but she keeps looking up at it to see if it is still there.  Eventually, the eyes start to move across the wall coming around the room to where the bed is.  It disappears behind the pillows and that is when the daughter suddenly sits up and tell her that she doesn't feel good and vomits all over the bed.  The aunt leaves ASAP and refuses to come to the home or to let her daughter visit after that.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_teeik,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/teeik/famfofevents_at_a_house_in_southern_louisiana/,

Not embellished enough I guess, too real and mundane for them. I saw this reddit and immediately liked it, just so y'all know. I enjoy truthiness. So I decided to tell my story to you guys, I think you'll appreciate it. 

Anyway, so my mom died in June of 2010. Later that summer, (in july) my dad and brother both had to go on trips, so I was alone in the house for a week. This was probably not the greatest thing for someone grieving over such a recent loss, but I think I needed to be alone anyway, at least for a little while.

So im in the house, pretty sad but doing ok, and night comes. I'm kinda creeped out, just because I'm alone. (or thats what I tell myself.) This strange energy seems to hang in the air near my mom and dad's room, sadness, very strange. I feel totally fine downstairs, so I just attribute the feeling to grief. But still, it's not like only her room reminded me of her, everything did. The night progresses, and I still feel unease. The door of the room is wide open, it's like... she's in there? Crying? (I know it sounds silly, I attributed it all to my imagination. Still kind of do... I'm really not sure.) 

I go to bed, and I swear to god I hear noises coming from in the room. Little creaking sounds, like she's walking around. Sobbing, very angry. I get the feeling that she wants my dad to get back. I think she hates me being up so late as well. These are just the feelings I got, every single night I was alone in that house.

Every night, once the sun set, the familiar feeling of dread and loneliness crept up on me. I started to freak out, so I had to close the door at about the 3rd night. Again this sounds crazy, but I swear to god in my mind I constantly heard this soft crying, like imagined but it was so real. I was so scared when I heard noises, I came extremely close to just camping out at my best friends house for the rest of the week. I felt like I was going crazy, with the energy that was emanating from my moms room. The door was closed, but I could sense her. I told my friend about all this and she asked me why I didn't just ask my mom if she was ok. I said that I knew I would definitely hear something if I did, so I was too scared to. 

When my dad finally got back, the energy went from full on boil to a low simmer. I could still feel sadness and anger from the room, but it had dissipated somewhat with my dad and brother's arrival. I eventually forgot about that terrible week, but then 5 months later christmas arrived and the energy came back.

My dad is... let's just say... very sentimental about everything involving my mother. He was having an extremely difficult time that christmas, and refused to decorate the tree. The box of ornaments and a nice new pine tree sat in a dark corner. Thats when I felt the oh so familiar energy. I could tell that my mom was pissed off with my dad and just wanted him to do the ornaments with his kids. It was like the room was vibrating, in my minds eye I imagined a silvery vibrating aura surrounding the inside of that room. This feeling was slight but dim in the rest of the house, you felt angry near the christmas tree but fine upstairs. I quizzed my family about their emotions in different areas of the house, and they had the same reactions as me. Odd, right? Leaving the house made you feel fantastic, it was very strange. 

A few days into my dad's strange behavior, we all had a huge blowout. we eventually calmed down and sat down in the living room. I told my dad that mom was angry about all this, and at that moment, a bb pellet that my brother left on the floor after fooling around with his broken bb gun (which was in his room) FLEW with a *pop* across the floor about 15 feet. Then, suddenly, this big heavy wooden divider plank thing that had been sitting in the corner for years suddenly SMASHED over onto the floor. We all sat in stunned silence, it was only us three in the room, sitting. My dad completely believed me after that, and we happily decorated the tree. 

Guess what? After that the feeling of sadness and anger was gone, and in its place was a feeling of joy. I haven't felt anything strange in the house since.

I know we're not supposed to talk about dreams, but just to put it briefly, in both my brother and my dreams, mom is ALWAYS alive. In mine I ask her where she's been, why she's been gone so long. She always has a weird excuse. My brother had a dream where he entered the living room and my mom was sitting there, smiling, surrounded by a slight golden glow. He said it was the most vivid dream he's ever had. 

Oh, one last little thing. My brother and I, for a while, reported seeing a black dog climbing the stairs out of the corner of our eye. We had a dog years before who passed away a while ago. We don't see the dog too much anymore, though. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,True,,,True,t3_k8fjw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/k8fjw/something_really_weird_that_happened_after_my_mom/,

 This is a true story of what happened to me while working at a hospital. I really don’t care much if you believe me, I’m not here to make you believe my story, I just want to share it. This story is going to be divided it into several parts because it’s long.

It begins sometime in May 2010. I started working at a small hospital in my hometown; I'm an OR tech, I work in the Operating Room. Like I said, it's a small place, we only have 4 Operating Rooms. On the same floor, we have the ICU and the maternity ward. During my graveyard shifts, I start with my list of things that need to be done, I always finish my work then turn everything off and just sit at the front desk. Basically, do nothing until morning. Everything started off great, then things started to get weird. I met with the Security Supervisor of the hospital and he told me about something that happened that night.

He was checking the floors and went into the Pediatric Ward to make his rounds. The PW was on the 4th floor at this time and half the floor was closed due to renovations, so only a few rooms had patients. He was talking to the nurses there when they heard the most horrific scream of agonizing pain coming from the closed part of the pediatric ward. Everyone was startled, even the parents of the patients came out of the rooms scared of what they had all heard. The security guard called for backup and they checked every room then went to the closed part of the ward and checked the rooms there. I’ve been there and, believe me, it’s a creepy place. The search went for an hour but they found nothing, I got chills when he told me that.

A couple of days went by. I was doing my usual routine work and that time I was alone here (I am actually writing this from work) preparing the OR for the next day. The room where we store the sterile instruments is very small, with wooden shelves. It's located at the end of the hallway near the autoclaves, the work room and where we store have the surgical bundles. One night, I finished early and went to the front desk to rest a little. As soon as the clock hit 3:00 am everything changed. You could feel the heaviness in the air, suddenly I heard what I thought was all the instruments fall to the floor. All the packages just hitting the floor, it was a hell of a noise; scared me shitless. I got up and walked to the hallway, I was angry. If an instrument package falls to the floor, I have to re-sterilize it so, I went back there to check the damage. To my surprise, nothing was out of place. Nothing fell off to the floor, I searched everywhere and everything was normal. That scared me and it got me thinking if I had really heard that noise or if I had accidentally fallen asleep and was just dreaming. That had me scratching my head all night. The rest of my shift was the usual, and when it ended, I was happy to go home.

Next night I had the graveyard shift, yet again. I did the same routine, and finished my tasks then headed off to the front desk to pass the time. Inside the OR's we have steel chairs that the nurses use and they are heavy. Almost everything in the OR has to be stainless steel. I sometimes go to the OR to check if everything is organized and that night, while walking down the hallway, I heard the chair inside the first OR move. I stopped walking, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Being curious, I looked through the window of the first OR and found that the chair had move from one side of the room to another. I was like ""WTF is happening here?!"". I went back to the front desk and stayed there the entire night scared as hell. I could hear the fucking chair move all night. At this point, I was contemplating leaving my job but I just ignored it and a couple of weeks later I was used to it.

But nothing was going to prepare me of what was going to happen the next nights…

EDIT: I'm so Sorry guys I know you want more Ill be posting later today the second part of the story I just want to make it as chronological as possible please be patient and stay tuned... :)

A introduced the idea to K and C, and they both seemed really interested in trying it. I wasn't so thrilled. I also wasn't so thrilled the first time we tried it before this. It's not like I don't believe in it or think it's ""hocus pocus."" You see, I'm a Christian, so I really don't think that I should be messing with things like that. Stuff like ouija boards invite certain creatures that I have no interest in interacting with. So I naturally protested the idea, saying it was dumb. I basically thought ""whatever"" and just let it happen, I didn't really think anything would happen, at least to me, mostly because it never worked the first time. We also were in my basement, I forgot to mention that. So there we were, in the basement of my family house that was built in the early 1920s, so it's pretty old and spooky, not to me though since I had lived there for some time then. A, K, and C did the ouija ritual ""calling all good spirits"" and all, seeing if the penny would budge beneath their clammy fingers, anxious and nervous to see if anything would happen. Nothing happened the first couple times, but after these first few tries it started working. The penny started moving and then some questions were asked. I don't remember if this happened right away but I remember one of the spirits saying that it's name was ""______"" which was the same name of K's grandpa who passed away a few years back. This made her uncomfortable so I took her spot. I was still not having a positive outlook toward the whole thing saying that it was a bad idea. I cooperated though. And this is when something freaky happened. I swear I didn't move the penny and to this day A and C claim they didn't either. But we were ""communicating"" with the spirit and it said something that it didn't like talking to us because it didn't like one of us. We asked it who, and I kid you not that it spelled out the next letters: ""F-U-C-K-(then my name)."" This freaked me out, because they swore it wasn't them moving the penny. I wanted to stop because I knew it was a bad idea and I didn't want the spirit to mess with me any more. It was really weird though. It knew I was the one who didn't want to do it.

Oh right names I'm Johnathan (16), my mom is Jeanette (51), my dad is John (47), and my sis is Crystal (18)

Ok so there has always been something off about my house. Not a threatening presence, but there always seems to have some sort of presence to it even when I'm home alone. Little things will happen, such as strange noises, feeling watched etc, but I thought that was just normal stuff, until the activity randomly boosted. I noticed this around a month ago, while I was on the pot. I was doing my business, and watching some Netflix while doing so. I noticed that right above me, which was a spare room, sounded like there was something moving around in there. So I paused my movie, then it stopped. Once I played it again, it would start again. I did this around 10 times and the same pattern kept repeating. So I called my mom and asked if anyone was home, and she said no that everyone was at my aunts. That's when I got really freaked out because as soon as I said that I heard a large boom followed by  footsteps coming down the stairs. I was scared shitless and told my mom what was happening, and she handed my dad the phone who was a cop. He asked me if I was comfortable going out there or if I needed to call the cops. I felt confident enough to go out there, but he told me to stay on the phone and check every room. I did this, and of course, found nothing. After I told him I found nothing he asked if I locked all the doors before, and I did. He didn't say it, but his tone suggested that he didn't believe me, otherwise why would he send me in a house with a potential intruder and just blow it off? Anyway, I thought nothing of it and just ignored it. A few days passed, and I was home alone. It was around 3 am and I was about to go to bed when I heard a man scream ""Debra, Help!."" I nearly shit my pants. I didn't dare move. I then heard footsteps coming up the stairs so my first reaction was to pretend to be asleep. The footsteps got gradually louder and louder until I realized it was coming for my room.  I then heard it stop at my door. I was sweating and nearly in tears, when I hear the door crack open. I hear a man whisper ""Debra, please help me..."". He then steps closer and closer until he is in my face, I couldn't tell how close since my eyes were closed, and then I hear a faint sob, followed by the door shutting. I was paralyzed with fear, when I hear my parents walk in the door and I sprint downstairs and tell them what happened. My dad shrugged it off and implied that I was just tired. As I'm walking upstairs my mom comes with me, and says she has to talk to me. She then tells me about this man that died in our house. He was very sick, and his wife Debra would take care of him. He was very old, and when he got sick he stayed in my room. The owner of the house (Debra) when we bought it tried to say that he died in the hospital, but there just wasn't something right when she explained it to my parents, something didn't add up my mother said. Back when I was still in my moms tummy she said she experienced weird things in this house. She said that something would move occasionally, and that when she was blowdrying her hair on HOT she felt this coldness overcome her and she said that she heard a faint sob and suddenly the double doors slammed shut. She told my dad of these encounters but he never truly believed her. She said that she often would hear footsteps upstairs and whatnot far before me and my sister could walk. She said the most terrifying was when he was in my room-to-be he was screaming and crying for Debra to help him. My mother (frightened to death, with 1 young child, and being preggers) ran outside and called the police. Of course they found nothing with no sign of force entry. She said that after we grew up a little, he basically left, so we thought. He now is back, but he doesn't seem harmful. I feel bad for this guy.

Since you all seem to know a lot about paranormal happenings, I thought Id share.

When I was around ten years old, I was outside in my front yard playing with my little sister, who was about 4 at the time. For the last few weeks there had been a girl coming around the neighborhood who was kind of weird. No one had ever seen her before when she first showed up, she was about 18 and thin with long, blonde hair. We assumed she had just moved into the trailer park down the street since she always seemed to come from there, and she would always come around asking to do favors for money and things like that, and everyone just had a weird feeling about her. So anyways, I was outside playing with my sister on this day, and my grandmother was babysitting us since my dad was at work and my mom had some errands to run. We were out playing hopscotch or something, and I turned and saw my mom walking down the street towards us. I was really confused as to why she was walking down the street and where the car was and everything. My sister stopped and stared at her too. She seemed confused as well for a second and then yelled ""Mommy!"" and started to walk towards her. 

This is the really strange part, out of nowhere my sister stopped and her smile completely faded. When I looked back at my ""mom"" it was the weird blonde girl I mentioned before. Definitely not my mom. And there is not really any way we could have just thought it was her from a distance, because like I said, the girl was very thin with long blonde hair. My mom is a not that thin and has very very short dark brown hair. I knew it was her when I saw her, and apparently so did my sister. I remember us looking at each other and running inside, especially since my parents had told us to stay away from that girl in the first place if we ever saw her. After that happened, I don't remember ever seeing her again.

Now I've heard of doppelgangers and have considered that as a possible explanation, but I've never heard a story of someone actually transforming like that. Has anyone else heard of something like this happening?",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1ft2qt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1ft2qt/me_fam_any_possible_explanations/,
1365802023.0,25,self.Thetruthishere,1c8dxa,[ME] The Three Rivers Dream,lo_la,32,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1c8dxa/me_the_three_rivers_dream/,"Okay, so having had good feedback on my first post, I might as well go ahead and share my strangest experience. There will be lots of dates and locations in this post for reasons that will become clear.  

It was May of 1996 and I was 18 years old, about to graduate from high school.  I had been attending community college in Centralia, Washington for my senior year, doing that program for high schoolers where you get both high school and college credit.

It started either the night before or after my brother's birthday, which is May 3.  I had a stupid, forgettable, nonsensical dream.  It was just silly.  The kind of dream you don't remember when you wake up, and if you do, you think ""why the hell did I have that dream? Silliness.""

In my dream, I was walking through [Three Rivers Mall in Kelso, Washington](http://www.iamchrisbrewer.com/2013/01/21/the-three-rivers-mall-is-dead-long-live-the-mall/), and there was a sweet smell in the air.  Just sweet - no further description.  Nondescript sweet.  

Something very important had just happened.  What that important thing was I didn't know in real life or consciously, but I knew in the context of my dream.  But in the dream all that really mattered was that the weight of that importance was in the forefront of my mind.  

Then, suddenly, everything shifted and (as I've recounted this experience over the years, I've used this descriptor) it was like I was in a James Bond movie, darting around corners, shooting at people, hiding from bullets.  (James Bond was what I compared it to because Goldeneye came out the year before and the sort of hiding, dodging, and shooting action seen in that movie was what it was like.)

And that was it.  That was the end of the dream.  It was a stupid dream - no memorable elements to it.

But then I *couldn't stop thinking* about this dream.  It occupied my thoughts at random times from when I got up in the morning to when I was in school to when I went to sleep at night.  This only punctuated the stupidity of the dream, because there was *nothing to think about.*  

As the days went by, this only got worse - I was obsessed with the dream, and I couldn't shake it.  I didn't analyze it at all - there was just nothing to analyze - it just stuck in my head. Sweet smell.  James Bond action.  Something important, but unknown to my conscious mind.  Walking through the mall.  Something important.

I had been to Three Rivers Mall in Kelso twice, possible three times, in my whole life.  The last time had been three years prior, when I was 15. Three Rivers Mall was just a totally underwhelming mall in a small town along the freeway.  

As the days passed, I began to wonder if going there would help solve things - resolve this obsession.  I wondered if I took the time and energy to go to this stupid little mall in a tiny town 44 miles south on I-5 it could finally be put to rest.

After nine days had passed, I caved and finally resolved to make the drive the next day. I didn't want to have to take the time. I just wanted to stop thinking about it.  I had to do something to put an end to this.

So the next day, instead of going to classes, I got in my beater car and drove. 

It was the mid-morning.  Traffic heading south out of the area was a tiny bit congested - no real slowdowns, but the freeway was thick with vehicles.  It wasn't until we were a good ten miles south that things started to thin out and I took notice of my surroundings.  

It was then I first noticed the van.

In 2003, I committed everything I could about the experience to writing because my memory of the event was starting to fade after seven years.  At that time I wrote that the van, which was white, was a then-current (like, no more than 1 or 2 model years older, so as old as 1994 at most) either Ford Aerostar or Chevy Astro.  Now that I review images of each I'm pretty sure it was the Aerostar - I remember the sharp downward slope with which the front of the vehicle angled toward the ground, the two rear windows that could've been mistaken for a large single rear window from a distance.  I don't think it had all the default windows visible, though the rear windows and the window behind the passenger seat were unblocked.

But it wasn't the windows I noticed first.  The first thing I actually noticed was that the van had no rear license plate.  And when my eyes gradually shifted upward to check the rear window to see if I could see a temporary plate taped into the window, I saw no sign of such, but I did see a large, square object draped with a cloth, about the size of a dishwasher or washing machine.

I was in the right lane, the van was in the center lane and a little ahead of me.  I changed lanes and gently sped up to come around the front on the driver's side.  

A man was driving.  White male, brown hair, 30s, normal body size, in a normal white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up and no tie.  

As I slowly came completely around the front of the vehicle, I saw that the front license plate was missing, too.  

It just baffled me.  I couldn't understand why someone would be driving on the freeway with no license plates.  I mean.. why?  If a patrolman saw it, that was the end of the trip, plain and simple.  And they'd be in trouble.

I slowly shifted back to the right lane and let myself gradually fall back, letting the van gradually pass me.  Another white male occupied the passenger seat, also in shirtsleeves with no tie.  A third, more stocky white male, also in rolled-up shirtsleeves and sporting Billy Mays style facial hair, sat in the seat behind the passenger seat.  

These guys looked totally government, but a government vehicle would have government plates.  The scene was both baffling and utterly creepy.

I gradually slid back into the position I was in when I first noticed the van had no rear license plate.  My slow tour around the perimeter of the vehicle had not yielded many answers, only more questions. The rear windows were tinted, thus I couldn't see more of the square object.

I decided to go around again.  I switched lanes behind the vehicle, slowly came up by the driver's door, then slowly went around front, switched lanes again, and slowed to let them pass me again so I could scrutinize the passenger side of the vehicle again.  It was during that last part that they began to speed up.  They passed me, accelerating.  I hit the gas, too, and followed them right along.  We were going faster and faster.  They were up to something and it couldn't be positive.

Within a couple of miles they hit 80, which was my speedometer's max.  I know I pushed it to 85, but my crappy car couldn't possibly compete with the new van and whatever its top speed might be.  They began to slip away from me.  I continued to chase, but I was losing them.  

I was probably nearing a quarter of a mile behind their speeding, license-plateless asses when I decided to take the next exit and call the state patrol.  I raced down the exit ramp, looking for the very first business I could find.  It was a small auto body place.  I lurched to a stop, ran inside and said I needed to call 911 - they gave me the store phone.  Based on past experience, I knew that when there's a freeway emergency, you have to ask for state patrol 911.  So I dialed 911, then asked for state patrol 911.  They patched me through.  I said frantically that I was at exit 39 and there was a white van with no license plates going probably 110 mph south on the freeway, and that they were probably a couple miles further south by this time.  The operator said they'd get a patrol car on it.  I thanked them and hung up.

And that was that.  It was over.  The guys in the shop were looking at me.  I thanked them for the use of their phone and went back out to my car.  My heart was pounding and racing.  I took a few deep breaths of the cool, moist spring air, and looked around.  It was then I realized where I was.

I was looking across the parking lot at Three Rivers Mall.

I stared.  It was pure coincidence that this is the exit I'd taken.  It was because I began falling too far behind the van.  The van must've been the important thing that just happened from my dream.  With nothing else to do, I went inside the mall.

I walked in the entrance on the right [in this diagram](http://threeriversmall.com/directory) and headed toward the main thoroughfare.  It wasn't until I was completely past it that I realized that the warm, pleasant, thickly sweet smell in the air was coming from the Cinnabon I'd just walked past.  The sweet smell - it registered, and I was even more shocked than I had been before.  I was lost in marveling over the impossibility of all this, and saw KB Toys, so I casually drifted over, deciding to play with stuff.  They had a video game setup at the entrance to the store, a first person shooter of some kind, given the date it was likely Duke Nukem 3D or something similar.  I'd casually played FPSs at school on the computers since Castle Wolfenstein in 1992, though I was no expert, and I knew how to handle the controls.  After a short time running around corners, dodging attacks from the enemy and attacking back, I dropped the controller in shock and stepped back, my eyes the size of saucers.  I'd just fulfilled the final aspect of my dream - the running, hiding, and shooting like in a James Bond movie.  

There is quite literally no ending to this story.  I turned around and left at that point.  Went back home.  When you have something *that* weird happen to you, you just don't know what to do or to think or to make of it.  There's no closure.  Something happened and there's no explanation for it.

**TL;DR: Had a nonsensical, totally forgettable dream that I ended up not being able to forget.  When I went to the place where it happened to try to stop thinking about it, it came true.**",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1c8dxa,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1c8dxa/me_the_three_rivers_dream/,
1365754257.0,24,self.Thetruthishere,1c71fl,[ME] [FR] I may or may not have been haunted/target by a malevolent spirit; Or: The Story of Demon Park. (Long),HoagieTime,32,8,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1c71fl/me_fr_i_may_or_may_not_have_been_hauntedtarget_by/,"For story purposes, let's say my name is Donald. Two summers ago my Best friend (we'll call him Randy)  and his girlfriend (Clarissa) moved into their first apartment. They were rooming with two other girls at the time, and one was a semi practicing pagan. 

Curious about her paganism we asked if she could show us a ritual. After a long rundown of all the rules and how we should behave and the steps of the process, she agreed to walk to a nearby park with us during the spring equinox and let us be involved in a ritual (Can't remember what it's called) where you basically offer certain indulgences (liquor, tobacco, etc) to gods or spirits and keep a positive thought in your mind. (I still have a very poor understanding of how the pagan belief system works, so I apologize for the vague descriptions. Plus I wasn't really listening, which comes in to play.) 

Anyway during the ritual, Randy and I decided to be jackasses and think negative, dark thoughts because we didn't believe in it and we thought it would be funny. After the four of us sat in silence for a while we each poured some alcohol into the ground and twisted some tobacco out of a cigarette and hung out for a while. We started hearing a rustling in the woods near us that sounded like an animal. We were a little spooked just because it was midnight during a solace and we'd been joking around about spirits, but we didn't really think much more of it until we got closer.

The way the branches were moving looked like a person was walking through them. Except there wasn't. There was nothing. No animals. No birds. no wind. Just a single patch of the bushes moving around for no reason. The pagan girl got really serious and said we have to leave the park and not turn around or look back. I remember her saying ""It's probably nothing. But if it is something, theres a good chance it's predatorial. Don't run or it will chase you. Don't look back or it will chase you. Just walk and look forward until we leave the park.""

We followed her instructions, got back to the apartment and drank a little bit. We were having a good time and didn't think much of what happened. We were just silly college aged kids getting scared in the woods. It happens.

The next morning my best friend was complaining that he could smell rotten eggs outside of his bedroom window all night. I half jokingly said ""you know, sulfur smells like rotten eggs. Maybe we did piss something off.""

Later that night, I got a text from the pagan girl saying that the living room blind that covered the window of the door suddenly snapped off and fell to the ground for no reason. She was getting paranoid and asked what I ""Prayed"" for during the ritual. I lied and told her I prayed for strength, not wanting to admit that Randy and I thought about nothing but demons and death and murder. She said she'd just shrug it off as a coincidence. 

Randy and I, both being raised on The X-Files and horror movies, began to get curious. We went back to the woods. This time we brought a third friend, Chris. Chris claimed to have some psychic abilities or something, but he's the kind of person who claimed a lot of things that were complete bullshit. Still, if he was at all legit, he may be useful. He told us he could pinpoint the exact spot we performed the ritual and we told him to show us. 

He lead us to the exact spot. The exact spot in a big open field of grass. It was a little weird, but whatever. The ground we did it at was slightly elevated from the rest, maybe he was just thinking like us as it was the reason we decided to do it there in the first place. He got really serious and told us we pissed something off and that we should probably leave and not come around at night when no one else is there anymore. We didn't listen and make him walk directly into the woods with us. 

As we got deeper and deeper into the woods, I started to get sick. It started off as just some nausea, which i usually get when i'm a little dehydrated. The farther we went, the sicker I got. We were about a quarter mile deep into the woods when I had to stop by a tree to rest. I was resting, Chris made us all be quiet because he could hear something. After quieting down, we could all hear it. Someone was saying something, over and over again, and it sounded like it was very slowly getting closer. It was some two syllable word, we all listened intently until we all had the same revelation of what it was saying, and typing it is actually giving me chills. What we heard was ""Do...nald.....Do....nald"" My friends instantly looked at me and I looked back at them and we all instantly decided, without saying a word to each other, to sprint out of there. Halfway through the run we all heard a loud, booming yet raspy voice, in what I can only describe as sounding like someone screaming and whispering at the same time, say ""DONALD""

We ran to the apartment and got drunk without talking, and just shook nervously for what felt like hours before we decided to hold off on going back for a while. 

We didn't hold off on going back. This was the most climactic part of the story. I can tell more of it in the comments, as a few more spooky things happened afterwards, but it really dwindles in excitement from here. Eventually, we came clean with the Pagan girl, and she decided to do a cleansing ritual in the apartment. Upon it's completion the whole place smelled like sulfur for a while. She did one alone at the park the same night. Nothing has happened since then.

Part 2 - http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1b6xl7/me_fr_haunted_asked_for_it_one_week_of_terrifying/

Now, I'm not a genius, nor do I play one on television, but I had to have been being absolutely insane not to notice all of these things happening in a pattern over the week. It baffles me to this day that it took so long for me to piece this all together, but so far, I just thought I had seen something creepy here and there. Anyway, this is what was happening after the church night:

I hadn't been sleeping well at all. For about a week. I was getting anxious and stressed all the time for no reason. I'm a very carefree, always hyped on life kind of guy, but I was losing the spring in my step more and more. When I say I wasn't sleeping well, I mean, I'd be lucky for 3-4 hours a night. I didn't know where this odd stress and paranoia was coming from. Anyway, this next part is a bit hard for me to write because it has to do with speculation and comparison relating a (possibly, possibly not) supernatural experience to a death of a friend of mine. I feel kind of like I'm tainting his memory just by saying this, but I'm just going to state facts and not say that anything that happened to me that day was foreshadowing or causing anything that happened to my friend. I'm sorry if that explanation seemed out of nowhere, but I had to put it down in this story just to put my guilt at ease.

I woke up around 8 am with about 3 hours of restless sleep from the night before. I want you to try something. Either have a nearby friend put your hand on your should, or do it yourself, and give it a firm, gentle shake, as though you're trying to wake someone up. Do you feel that little tingly sensation the moment the hand leaves your shoulder and the nerves in your arm get their wits back about them? That's what I awoke to that morning. I woke up with a tingling in my shoulder, and although I didn't feel being shaken, my brain's immediate first thought was, ""someone just had their hands on you."" I was the only one awake at that time. It was a bit odd, but then again, I had been awake 20 hours of the day or more for the past 3 nights. Looking back though, if I barely felt the aftermath of what my mind thought of as being shaken awake, who's to say that that's not what was waking me up early and ruining my sleep every single morning? I shudder at the thought now, but went about my morning as though nothing had happened, at the time.

I got ready just like any other day, and I headed out the door to go to my friend Kelsi's house for a bit around noon. Just as I open my door, a black cat darted between my feet into my apartment. I was weirded out but didn't think anything of it really. I started knocking on doors looking for its owner. In my building, there are 6 apartments and 3 floors. 2 doors on each floor. I'm on the bottom level, and the people across from me didn't own it. The people above me didn't own it, be the people across from them did. A lady I had never seen around the building before, (I've lived there 11 years) in her mid-40s came down and waited outside my door while I collected her cat. I have two cats of my own who are very good, bengal cats. When I went inside, my cats' tails were puffy, and they were crouched low on either side of the black cat about to pounce or run away at any point. The black cat was sitting in the middle of my dining room lazily flicking its tail back and forth and staring at me when I came back in. Odd behavior for a cat that has two mild-mannered cats about to tear its face off in fear. I picked up the cat, and it seemed indifferent to me, and I gave it to its owner, and I grabbed a piece of sandwich meat when I got back inside, split it in two, and gave it to my cats who were still in shock. Then, I left for Kelsi's.

I still didn't think anything weird was going on at that point, which is crazy looking back.. I drove to the interstate and got on because she lives somewhat out in, more or less, the country area, a ways south of the city. I got off the interstate after 15 minutes of driving. I turned right, and headed down a 50-MPH stretch of road that I had to drive for about 6 miles. I pulled out right after a van passed by me going in the same direction. I followed them, going the same way, and they were going about 48 or 49, but I stayed behind them just because I was feeling lazy that day, and I was listening to some good music and texting on the long drive. They slowed down after about a mile and pulled off to the side. I passed them, and oddly saw nobody in the van. I only got to look for about 1 second though, and they could have been leaning over. I passed by, and the second I passed them, they pulled back on from a dead stop on the shoulder. I kept driving with my cruise at 59 MPH because, in my state, you can't get any points off your license, and only get charged $1 per mile for a speeding ticket if it's under 10 MPH above the speed limit. This van was right on my ass. I thought it odd that the lazy, under the speed limit van was now riding me like it was their job, so I waited for them to pass and slowed down to about 50. They kept pursuing me less than a car's length behind me, and I don't remember what the driver looked like at all, but I think there was one for sure at this point. I sped up to 60, then 70, then 80, then 90, all the way up to 107 MPH (how fast my Impala let's me go) and they kept pace with me perfectly the whole time. We stayed at 107 for about 2 miles, and then I had to stop at a stop sign to turn right to get to her house. I slow down, and they do the same, and I book it out of their without more than a slight pause at the stop sign, expecting to be chased all the way to her driveway, but the van just guns it straight ahead instead of turning right. Weird, I thought. Then I arrive at my friend's, and we hang out, and nothing weird happens the rest of the day, until about 2am.

From 11:30-3:30am, I was hanging out with Collin and ""Sam G"". I drop them off after a party, and my friend and bandmate, John, texts me just then and asks me to bring him a red bull or two since he hadn't been sleeping well for the past few days and he worked the night shift. from 10-6:30 at a loony bin in our neighboring city just over the bridge. My sleep schedule was messed up beyond belief, so I said sure, and I got 4 red bulls and headed over. As I was driving through a residential area about 3 blocks from his work, I see a shape padding across the street, (actually crossing the street this time) and he looked up to see my car, and I slow down to a stop, and he does the same right in front of my car. It was a golden retriever. I open my door to see if I can call him over and check if he has tags, but he jogs right by me, now in the other lane and running down the street, not across, and he jogs right by me never taking his eyes off of me even while he's running the opposite way of where he was looking. I remember there was a car turning down the block in the same direction as me, and I was actually worried that it wouldn't see the dog, and the dog, whose eyes are trained on me the whole time still, wouldn't turn around and see a car coming at him. Thankfully the other car stopped, and the dog kept jogging down the street with his eyes on me until I got back in my car and drove away. I thought his stare was weird and kind of foreboding. As I got to John's workplace, I remembered that I forgot to call a friend back who had asked me to join him at a party after I left the one I was at. Oh well, I thought, he probably is too drunk to care by now. We have a red bull in my car, and talk about life, and I leave around 4ish and head home.

I wake up to a call or a  message from one of my friends, I forget who or what or when, probably about 8am, and my friend informs me that a friend of ours passed away last night around 4 am. I think it's a joke and start getting upset until he/she gives me all the details and I check with other friends to verify. It's true. My friend was leaving a party with 3 of my other friends. They were thoroughly drunk. They took a shortcut under a bridge near the college while walking back to the dorms, and they crossed the train tracks, long story short, one of them was hit by the train. He died on impact crossing the tracks. It was horrifying to hear. I'm not going to make any comparison or relate any events that were happening that night to each other, but that's what happened, and as far as I can guess, that dog walked in front of my car around the exact same time my friends were crossing the tracks. I have no way to verify specific times, but I'd be willing to bet they were at the very least within the same hour. That's everything that happened that day, past me is still oblivious to anything happening. There is only one more night of adventures left in this story until it resolves, but, as always, any insights, questions, comments, or similar experiences are welcome. Thanks.

My grandmother and I have always had things in common. Before her passing in 2010, she and I would discuss all things paranormal- i.e. ghosts, UFOs, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, unexplained events, etc. 


I have always had an issue with the afterlife- ever since I was very young, I had some really eerie experiences (some of my other real experiences are in /nosleep. Can't you post real and ""fake"" there? Moving on). From being held down in my sleep, feeling the hands of a passed loved one on my shoulders, to simply seeing a clouded figure walk right in front of me. While these are things I'm used to now, I still can't get over the experiences involving my grandmother. We had a long-standing joke about her coming back after death to ""keep an eye on me,"" and I think that's exactly what she's doing..


Last year, my fiance and I went off on an adventure. There was supposed to a meteor shower, and we wanted to find the closest place without much light pollution-- so off we went. He and I began talking about the woods surrounding us, what kind of wildlife was in the brush, etc. I hadn't really thought of where we were going, but it just so happened that we ended up at a nearby phosphate mine. Now I don't know how many mines any of you have been to, but at 1am, they all look INCREDIBLY creepy. Trusting my gut, we decide to turn around and just try to watch the meteor shower at home.


While we're trekking back home, I have an oh so familiar sensation (this happens every other day or so.); it was as if someone was pouring icy hot on my chest and back. This is the usual feeling I get when a spirit is trying to communicate with me, and I often times black out for a second, or go into a trance briefly when this happens. This isn't so great, however, when you're driving. I swerved into the other lane, then ripped back into ours. My fiance is freaking out, and I'm ""getting back to reality."" He just stares at me, and asks me if I'm having breathing issues. He then explained that it feels like his throat and chest are coated in icy hot, and he kept getting the feeling that someone is pulling at him. I tried to calmly explain what it could be, and why, and he starts crying. All of a sudden, the radio shut off, and there's a static sound. He was freaking out more. Bear in mind, that I'm driving about 55-60 mph here, and stopping isn't really the first thing on my mind in the middle of no where. So I did my best to explain what's going on to him. I tell him that someone was murdered out here, and buried. It's a man in his 30's, and he's begging us to help him. My fiance just stared at me with his jaw hanging; just dumbfounded. He started explaining the feeling that overcame him just 1/4 of a mile back, and he stated that what I had just shared was almost 100% identical to how he was feeling. I don't know about any of you, but trying to explain something paranormal to a non-believer is very difficult... and when they start feeling the same things YOU do, it's even worse... See, my fiance ""believed"" in ghosts and demons, but never to the extent that I did. The entire ride back to the house, he grilled me about EVERYTHING. ""How did this happen? Why does this happen? When does it usually happen...etc.""


Once we get home, he went to the restroom, but returned just a moment later white as a ghost. He then went on to describe in painful detail my grandmother's description. From the color and texture of her hair, to the detailing on her shoes. My fiance has never seen a picture, nor had a description of my grandmother in any way, shape or form. He then went on to tell me that she had pat him on the back and gave him a sense of approval, and that after that, he felt alone (as in, she vanished, technically speaking..) I have seen my grandmother several times in my home (after her passing), but never I have I ever heard my fiance say that he has seen her... let alone interacted with her. 


I can say that this has brought us closer together, and it's nice knowing that I'm not the only one who can communicate with, feel, and SEE these things..

Edit: I will answer whatever (within reason) questions anyone has.

Last night I had an odd feeling whilst laying in bed, and could hear movement in the ""office"" of my bedroom (a separate room, without a door) and in the back of the room beside the window. I tried to ignore it, and tried to fall asleep, but was unable. 


This went on for about an hour of tossing and turning, until I sat up and got a drink of water from beside my bed (this is the only reason I am sure I was awake, other than just feeling as such, as I drank it all and low and behold, no water this morning). I lay back down, and suddenly hear a loud, awful scream. It sounded distant, but also right next to me. It was a male voice, and I froze. It honestly sounded like someone was being murdered. I went to the window, and looked out over the neighborhood park the noise was most likely coming from. The entire thing is lit, and I couldn't see a thing. 

It was 2 in the morning, and I live in a very nice neighborhood. Screaming in the night isn't something you'd be at all likely to hear. The strangest thing was the distance to the voice, it sounded so far away that I almost shouldn't have been able to hear it, yet could clear as day.

There are skeletons under the floorboards (not kidding, they have left them in situ and placed a perspex box over the top for people to look through!). Needless to say the age of the building and its history have given rise to several encounters and spooky stories.

The house is used as both a school and a venue for weddings, etc. I attended the school and waitressed weddings there. 

1. My manager (a middle aged, religious mother) told us about one occasion when she was locking up the house as the last person there, around 2am. 

She was coming out of the staff entrance and noticed the upstairs lights were on. So she went upstairs and switched them off, came back down, locked the door... the lights were on again. She went back upstairs, turned them off, went back down and they were on again. She went back upstairs and said out loud, ""If anyone is here, this is the last time I am going to turn these lights off. I'm going now."" Went back downstairs, locked the door and left. Just as she was walking to her car she saw the lights come back on again.

She is not the type to make this kind of thing up. But it's an old house, dodgy wiring perhaps?!

2. Students and teachers have reported seeing a lady in grey walking down the corridor, straight into the wall of a classroom. Apparently the wall is a modern addition to the building, which now blocks off the end of the corridor.

3. Another story from a different manager: A female figure has been seen walking down the grand staircase in the house. A few years ago contractors were renovating the staircase overnight. In the morning, the building manager came in to open up the house and found all the contractors' tools and equipment had been left. Annoyed at this, he phoned them up to ask why they hadn't cleared up before leaving. Apparently something had frightened them so much they had abandoned everything and fled the house. They refused to return to the house to come pick up their equipment and asked that it be dropped off to them.

This has happened twice, The first time I was at the supermarket in the car park when I heard what sounded like an old announcement system, It said something in either a language I didn't understand or too rough to make out the words, then I heard planes taking off but not modern planes, Like planes from WW2. The second time was when I was peeing (Yeah..) and I heard an air raid siren. It sounded for about 3 seconds then just stopped.

The token:

I posted this in AskReddit a few days ago.. I found A token [like this](http://i.imgur.com/Ah3Myb6.jpg) in my garden, From Circa 1930. Though after bringing it in my family started experiencing strange things, I was in bed one night, It was around midnight, when I heard footsteps. I thought it was my dad or something walking around so I wrote it off, But it kept getting closer and was accompanied by heavy breathing, They sounded like pretty heavy boots, Steel-toe kind. The footsteps got closer until they reached my bed then stopped. I sat up to see what it was when it breathed in my ear, Then I heard it walking away while still heavily breathing. It wasn't sleep paralysis or anything, My dad got up a few hours later and heard the same thing walking up to him and stopping.

Ghosts:

When I was younger, around 6 or 7, I came out of the toilet and looked down the stairs, And around half-way down were 2 young children, a boy and girl around 4 or 5, dressed in victorian clothing, The girl had a dress on and the boy had a blue shirt, brown trousers and suspenders. I walked toward them and they disappeared just before i reached them.

I've also seen [shadow people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_people) A few times, One time it actually went straight toward me and disappeared just before hitting me.

I've heard and seen a dog multiple times, I've heard it panting, it's collar jingling and it whimpering.

My most recent paranormal experience was when I was in bed again last week, Around 2 am, and I heard something hit my bed following by a ""pah!"" sound, It sounded like an old woman's voice. 

Strange feelings:

Whenever I walk up the stairs I get a feeling of dread, as if something is behind me, chasing me. 

Other things:

My house was built between the 1950s and the 1970s (I think) and was used as a Bed and Breakfast place with lodgers from all different cities and possibly countries (It was a popular holiday destination back then because it was cheap) then the owner just packed up and ran one day, Nobody knows why.

When my family moved in, One of the neighbours asked my parents a few days later if ""they have had anything happen yet"". I can't find any information about the place.

We have objects in the house that could cause some of my experiences..

(Major events only not bumps in the night),JakanoryJones,38,12,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/17e9yw/me_fam_friends_forgot_the_fucking_tag_sorry/,"Right, guess I'll go chronologically.

So the first story is from when I may have been about six or 7 way back in the 90's (I'm 18 now and I don't math.) So this one night I remember just waking up like not drifiting out of sleep or anything like that I just sat up and there was (I'm gonna jump the shark early here) a 2D cartoon ghost at the end of my bed. I fucking shit you not. 2D in the real world. It was like a rectangle but where its head was was round not corners. It had long oval eyes and a bigger longer oval mouth. It was rippling on the edges and the edges of the mouth and eyes the whole time. I lay back down counted to ten then sat back up and it was still there, I went to try again and just passed out. Now I recently heard a similar story which was explained by the person being on some medicene with halucinagenic side effects, but my mum and dad have never said anything about that. So who knows. I don't remember being ill because i mentioned it to my mum in the morning as I was getting dressed for school.
Same time period, same house. I don't remember how it was done but there was always a hole in the wall of my bedroom. One night i distinctly remember a yellow eye looking at me through it and then my bed shaking violently when i tried talking to it, at which point i broke down in tears and sat in a corner.

On to the more modern stuff. This being around the age of 14 to 16. 
My Grandma and Grandad always went out to the club (like the one in peter kay's pheonix nights. His humour is completley spot on.) anyway, me and my deaf friend would usually stay at their house when they went out. My grandma told me a ghost story about that house and the house creeped me out before she told it to me. Seeing as I've got alot to get through I'll TLDR it. She woke up, WWII nurse on her bed, told her everything was going to be okay, vanished.
Right with the WWII nurse in mind I shall continue. Me and my friend were particularly hyper this one night, doing front flips on the sofas and stuff, daring each other to sip my grandads whisky and stuff. My friend flipped onto the chair and I went to chase him and he jumped to the bottom of the stairs and froze. From where I was I couldn't see upstairs. He wasn't moving and I just assumed he wanted to sit down for a bit because I too was exhausted. He then turns to me and motions at me to come towards him. I look up the stairs and say ""what?"" to which he replies ""I've just seen a ghost"" I think hes just bull shitting and sit down and so he brushes it off and sits down. Then I turn to him and say ""wait, what did it look like then?"" To which he replies with the worst answer: "" like a nurse but all black and with no legs."" I freak the fuck out and scribble a note saying ""seen a ghost im at my friends"" and leave the back door open because I was out of there so fast.

Same house, around the same time period I remember sitting with my dad and auntie and he had given me a watch. I remember it vividly because it was a replica of a rolex and I couldn't wait to show it off even though it was pretty much worthless. I see in the window to the back garden a huge yellow eye staring at me. I assume its the reflection of my watch and move my wrist about and it doesn't move, both my dad and auntie are talking about something and are using hand gestures all over the place and this reflection wasn't moving. Then it blinked and turned away from the window and vanished. Creepay.

Bit more recent. Circa 2008-2010. 
My dad and auntie had bought a house because they were both single and were struggling for money and I lived with them most of the time because my school was very close. They worked shift works and when I'd get in from school there was always an hour or so I had to myself where one had gone to work and the other was on the way back. I usually took these oppertunities to have 'happytime' or play rockband very loud. This particular time I was playing rockband. I had all the doors open and was playing the drums, from my room I can see into my dads room and I heard over the music the floors creaking like someone had run over them and a shadow. I ignored it because we have pipes and there is a tree outside his window. Then I hear it again only I'm pretty much watching the door and see quite clearly its the shadow of a person. Shit I think, we're being robbed. I grab my baseball bat that my dad makes me keep in my room incase we get robbed and go into the room. Nothing there. So I continue playing rockband and I hear a door close downstairs. Fuck I'm not imagining this one. I grab my cam corder and the bat again and peer down the stairs filming all the time waiting for whoever is down there to make his whereabouts known. I see a shadow go past the kitchen door and the knife draw close. Now im fucking scared. I creep down stairs recording the whole time with my bat and search every godamn room/hiding place. Nothing. Not one thing. I stop recording and watch the video back trying to see the shadow. FUCKING NOTHING SHOWS UP ON CAMERA. No sounds no shadows. When my dad gets home I rush to show him and boot my camera back up AND THE FUCKING VIDEO HAS SOMEHOW DELETED ITSELF. (I know how convenient, it was the most cliche' moment of ever in my life.)

Also in that house there was a helicopter that flew to our house, hovered about 20 feet above our garden. No I'm not exageratting, 20 fucking feet. The guys looked at us, waved then went back the way they came. My dad and auntie saw it too. We don't know who they were, could be someone who just got his flying liscence and saw us come out of our house I dunno.

Anyway current house 2011- today.
In this house I've had time slow down on me, seen white shadows, black shadows and scene faces hovering in windows, had bowls dropped in the middle of the kitchen when theres none out and all that crap. Casual hauntings. But this story is the most scared I've ever been in my life. If I can find the article about it in the paper I shall link yall up. But I'll get to that later. 
Right, at the end of my street if you turn left there is a field for dog walkers with a chopped down tree right by the turning for the field. We ingeniously call it ""The log"". So me and my friend Liam (that is his name, who cares) are sitting on this log and he is on the phone to his girlfriend who he has been talking to for a good 20 minutes. As you can imagine I am thoroughly bored. I look at the horizon and see a shooting star go all the way from behind the ground. (like as far as you can see, behind that. Almost as if its orbiting the earth). Anyway it shoots all the way up over my head and as I turn to see where it went I am greeted by huge fucking balls of bright cloud spinning in a perfect circle and smaller ones inside that spinning the oposite way and another ring inside that spinning the opposite way to that. My immediate reaction is ""LIAM WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT"" He turns around and becomes speachless. I start running to my house yelling at Liam to hurry up but he is completley dumbfounded. He cant tell his girlfriend what is happening and he cant move. I yell at him ""COME ON IM NOT STAYING HERE."" 
This disc is hovering above a house that is literally about 40 meters away from us. I cant budge him, I fly up my street, I mean seriously I've never run faster. And sprint through my front door shouting my dad saying theres a UFO outside!. 
He doesn't believe me at first but when he notices I'm as white as a sheet he comes outside to see. 
Nothing.
Theres nothing there.
Then when we are about to go back inside It rises up above the house directly infront of us. It could of passed for some kind of ellaborate light show at first but no, its moved to behind another house and it rose above it. It stayed there for a while, then Liam tried to go home and one of the rings of lights dropped down from the rest and shot off towards him. He comes sprinting back saying that its following him and my dad agrees to walk him home. Once again its splits into two and follows him. When my dad comes back the other ring of lights doesn't follow him back and stays with Liam at his house. He showed his Mum and Dad too. They brushed it off as ""some lights"". Whatever that means. We watched it and it just got dimmer and dimmer till it went.
I tried to record it but when I pointed it at the lights my phone just went all pixilated. Everyone else tried it and got the same results.

We all think my dad got abducted at one point which my Auntie and Grandma were witness too but thats another story. Not a lenghty one, just that if anyone wants to hear it I would ask my dad's side of the story, my aunts and my grandmas individually for you to get the best picture of what happend. I know this all sounds very far fetched but believe me its true. If anyone wants me to elaborate on any story just ask :) We are also followed by a man that went by the name of Larry Dean but now goes by the name of Lawrence Diritche'. He claims to be writing a book about paranormal things and keeps ringing to hear our stories but we go through long periods of not hearing from him. We've since rung his mobile and house phone to which a woman answered not knowing anything about either of the names. Plus theres no book 
:(  If you read all of this well fucking done. Took me ages to type.

This story is the only one that involves something paranormal, unlike the others which involve real dangers. 

My stepmother used to live in a house slightly isolated from the rest of the neighborhood. It was winter time, and she was home alone. Nothing out of the ordinary  happened during the day, and when it was about midnight, she went to sleep. She awoke in the middle of the night, it must have been about 3 AM, but she felt a bit weird. She wasn't fully awake, and despite not being under the influence of drugs, she felt a bit ""high"". It's a bit hard to explain, but I'll try. You know when you just wake up and you feel really groggy, sleepy and disoriented? Thats pretty much what she described, except she felt like that during the entire incident.

Continuing with the story, she looked to right side of her bed and saw two weird things standing there. Due to her sleepy state, she took a moment to figure out what was happening. After analyzing the things beside her bed for a while, she described them as two really tall and skinny white humanoids observing her while she slept. They stood there practically motionless observing her untl she eventually fell asleep. I don't remember if she described what their faces looked like, so I'll probably ask in a couple of days if it helps identify what these things were.

When I heard this story for the first time, I was almost sure she just had a nightmare.

Just want to throw that out there right now, so no it couldn't possibly be past occupants.

Anyways, years ago when I was a wee little ankle-biter, I believe I saw some suspicious things in my house. Each was different, with only one occurring more than once.

The first is one of a dog. This dog looked strikingly like our old dog Tasha. I have only seen pictures of the old girl, as she was killed by a motorcycle when I was barely a year old. I was coming downstairs after having a bath, and was the only one downstairs, as my mom was washing my at the time baby brother. I saw a shockingly calming image of a dog, matching closely the physical and size-related description of Tasha I had been given from the pictures I had seen. She looked off in the distance, silently barking at something before vanishing. I immediately told my mom, and was told to ignore it. I told my pops a month or so ago, and gave the description of the image, and he firmly believes it to be his dog. She is buried in the backyard, next to the pen she escaped from that tragic day. She had always treated me as her own, going so far as to try and re-wash me with her tongue after baths when I was a baby.

Next, we have what I thought to be my guardian angel. Several times throughout my childhood, I saw a blonde-haired boy in glowing white clothes sitting around the property. In most cases, he sat and watched me. Once or twice, when I looked at him, he looked up from something, as if I were distracting him from something. He would quickly vanish after I met his eyes. I stopped seeing him around my 7th birthday, if I recall correctly. He always appeared basked in light, never in a dark corner or anything of the sort.

Lastly, the least exciting one. Around the time I stopped seeing my ""guardian angel"", I saw a black shadow move quickly past my room and into the laundry room next to it. My whole family was in the family room with me, and dear Tasha had yet to be replaced, so it couldn't have been a pet, as fish can't fly. Yet. I digress. I felt confused as to what it was, and tried to follow it into the laundry room. I found nothing.

The land the camp sits on was once the site of a battle between the US cavalry and Lipan Apache Indians. 
Anyway, so one night I was walking along the river back to my cabin at about 3am and then I reached a part of the trail that went up a small hill so you were looking down on the river.  When I looked down I saw a figure standing by the river looking across it. In the moonlight, it kinda looked like a person, maybe.  It was just all white.  I stared at it for a moment and then it started to move to the left then vanished behind some bushes.  I ran the last half mile back to my campsite. 

I did not tell anyone about it, because I had no real idea of what to say.  But, the next weekend we played a camp wide game of hide and seek with some of the junior counselors.  We kicked it off after dark, and I waited in the dining hall for everyone to return after being found.  After about an hour, three of my staff came running in yelling about how uncool it was for us to prank them like that.  They claimed that they saw a person in what they called a ""white sheet"" walking down by the river.    But, it could not have been a prank.  Everyone was accounted for.  I did not share my experience with them, I just told them that ""the prankster would eventually be found out"".

This particular one began in Germany, while my husband was stationed in Mannheim. We lived in a recently renovated apartment on base, in the Ben Franklin Community. It's since been closed down due to realignments.

When we moved in, our daughter was 9 months old. The true stuff didn't start until my husband deployed the first time, in early 2003. Nothing truly terrified me for the first few months, as I was used to activity. I should mention I'm sensitive to these things. It started with a sound like a ball bouncing on the ceiling, and it would follow me room to room. We lived on the top floor and above me was a storage unit and nothing else.

When Ashleigh was about 15 months old, she started playing tea with her ""friend,"" whom I couldn't see. One night, ash was particularly fussy and I attributed it to teething and put her to bed at her usual time. At three or so in the morning, I was awoken by something thumping me in the forehead. Like a hard flick, right to the center of my fracking head. My first thought was the baby, so I sprung up and found her with a 104.5 temperature.

That was the first thing that scared me, but I was grateful. My baby might have died if I hadn't been woken up. Little things like this continued. The cat would chase the milk ring when someone invisible threw it down the hall. Keys went missing. Cabinets would be open in the morning when everyone else was sleeping.

One evening, I hadn't heard any noises or seen anything for the whole night. I thought it was odd, since the ball was always bouncing. No sooner did I think that than what sounded like a popcorn pusher, like toddlers have, erupted over my head. It really freaked me out, mostly because I'd never heard it before. I went to bed a while after that.

I woke abruptly in the early morning. The room was ice cold, even though it was summer and we didn't have a/c. I laid there with my eyes open, looking around, when my hair shifted as though it was pushed aside, and a very masculine voice whispered, ""Charlotte,"" in my ear.

My name is Lindsay.

I didn't sleep in my room for a week after that. A year and a half or so later, my husband was home on medical leave from his second deployment and had just come off a 24 hour duty. He went straight to our room and collapsed in bed. Our newborn son was on the couch sleeping, and I was doing dishes.

Just before I finished up, my baby started crying. I grabbed a towel and looked out into the living room, but saw my husband on the couch patting his back and Peyton calmed down. So i finished the dishes and went back out, expecting my husband to have the kiddo sleeping on his chest or something, but he wasn't there.

He was sleeping, and still in his uniform. The man I saw was in a dark shirt.

We moved a few months after my husband came home from deployment. While we were in the hotel room waiting for our flight to the states the next morning, my daughter, then 3, says, ""Mommy, I'm glad Emily can come along.""

""Who's Emily?""

""The little girl who crawled out from under my bed.""

O.o I was scared. That's Grudge stuff right there. Emily is a little girl who followed us to Texas, where she finally revealed herself to me. But that's a story for tomorrow, since I'm talking your ears off right now. I think someone else followed us, too, which is what triggered me to write this in the first place.

And I don't think it's Emily. I'll post more tomorrow about what's happened more recently. Thanks for reading, and if I missed some grammar I apologize. I'm on my iPad.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_10jgqo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/10jgqo/me_i_dont_think_its_left_yet/,

It's a gorgeous house on a little over one acre of property. It's three floors high, not counting the attic. It had original stone walls in the first floor/basement area, handmade cabinetry in the kitchen, and plenty of ghost activity. I've got plenty of stories from the four years I lived in this house, but this is just one of them. This is also the one that freaks me out the most. Which is kind of weird, considering that it didn't happen directly to me, and I didn't really see anything. Still gives me the chills, though.

I lived in the house with my mother, step-father, and two younger sisters. At the time of this particular story, my younger sister Natalie was three or four years old. I had to babysit her a lot, since both of my parents worked and my other sister, who was fourteen or fifteen at the time, didn't like to watch her.

On this day, Natalie and I were sitting in the basement/first floor area. This floor was half in the ground and half out, since the house was built into a hill. On the side facing out of the hill, we had an old wooden door with a window facing out to the driveway. There was also a porch outside of this door. It was daylight, so you could see outside from my seat on the couch. I was watching television while Natalie played on the floor.

It was a pretty quiet day until Natalie looked at the door and started laughing her head off. I thought it was kind of odd, but I didn't think anything of it.

A few minutes later, she started laughing even harder. So I chuckled and asked her, ""What's so funny, Nat?""

She looks at me with a big grin and says, ""The face!""

I stopped laughing. ""The face?""

She points at the window of the door and says, ""The smiley face that was right there!""

I have never felt so uncomfortable in my life. I made her come upstairs to the kitchen with me for the rest of the day until my step-dad came home.

Being from Small Town, Wisconsin, we had little to do but drive to distant places and hope for a thrill. Still in high school, we took advantage of our curfewless nights and stuffed a backpack with flashlights, mirrors, incense, candles, matches and a wide assortment of ghost hunting gear. 

My friend Liz and I researched supposedly haunted places near where we lived. This particular place was in Dousman, Wisconsin. It was called Tabernacle Cemetery. With the sun quickly setting, we hopped in my car and made the 30 minute drive. It was just me, Liz and our friends Beth and Rob. We found the road upon which the cemetery was supposed to be located, but couldn't find it. After about 20 minutes of driving back and forth, my headlights finally caught a few gravestones we'd missed before. 

The cemetery was located on an overgrown hill, which explained why it was so hard to see. We pulled off to the side and trekked through the brambles to the graves themselves. 

Strangely, the dates on the graves generally ended about 1880 and picked up again about 1950. It seems as if the place had been abandoned for the 70 years in between, as many of the gravestones were so weathered they were illegible. 

Not much happened that night, and when a van full of raucous 20-somethings raving about K2 pulled up, we lost interest quickly. The only interesting thing that came from the trip was a chuck of crumbled gravestone that i took with me. 

As we pulled away from the graveyard, a large truck appeared behind us with its brights on. While I was unnerved, I was concentrating on finding a way home since the main road was closed for construction. After a half hour of losing ourselves on the back roads, with the truck always behind us, we said fuck it and just drove on the rocky and mid-construction main road. I was so busy paying attention to the road that I didn't notice the truck turn off. 

About 6 months later, we were all in Barnes and Noble. I stumbled upon a book called ""The Wisconsin Road Guide to Haunted Locations"" by Chad Louis and Terry Fisk. Out of curiosity, i opened the index and found Tabernacle in there. With all of my friends around me, I jumped up and screamed as I read the following excerpt: 

""The Dare: If you drive to the cemetery late at night, a mysterious truck will appear and follow you until you get back to the city."" 

Being previously unaware of this, we all decided that it was worth looking into again. 

&lt;b&gt; TL;DR: My friends and I went to a ""haunted"" cemetery and found nothing. Followed by a truck as we were leaving, later found out that the truck was the lore behind the cemetery. &lt;/b&gt;

Note: the crumbled piece of gravestone gave me a bad vibe when I had it at home. I kept seeing shadows flicker in my periphery and felt nauseous. I returned soon after to put the grave stone back, and that is when I took all the pictures. That's why they're all in daylight.

We were both free-thinkers/pot smokers and became fast friends.  During our fall break (3 day weekend) he took me home to party with his high school friends...

On one of our little excursions he became really excited about visiting an old insane asylum called The Ridges.  The place sat on a large hill and driving up to the old building was a creepy experience in itself.  The main, front building was still operational as a museum, so there were other cars there, but we arrived right before closing.

We didn't park in front, but drove around the right side of the large building.  There were other, smaller buildings on the grounds that we drove amongst and inspected.  At the small cemetery, we got out and walked around.  We were generally just enjoying the silent, reverent atmosphere and not really feeling or expecting anything creepy.

We walked around a bit more... anyone been there?  I think the Ohio University has a high ropes course nearby.  Anyway about an hour later, we had smoked more, climbed around on some wooden contraptions, and then decided to go get something to eat.

The car was where we left it by the cemetery, and we headed off around the building in the same direction we had come in, with the idea that we would just circle it and head out.  At the back of the building, there was an asphalt courtyard of sorts.  It could have served as parking, or a loading area.  We pulled in about halfway, realized that it was a dead end, and began to turn around.  It was then that I noticed something written on one of the windows on the third floor.  I could not easily read it, so I stopped the car, and we got out.

It was written across the width of the window, but not intelligible.  Some of the letters looked familiar, there were what appeared to be two ""m""'s, an ""i"", but it took us a minute.  Then it hit me.  It was written from inside the window, so it appeared backwards to us.  It was a name- ""timmy"".

And just as I figured it out and said it out loud, an adult-sized figure, dressed completely in gray came to the window, then backed away slowly.  We both saw it, our jaws hitting the pavement.

""What the--,""  I said with a look on my face that I can only describe as a pissed off, ""not-bad"".  We immediately got in the car, had a quick WTF laugh about it, then went to Burger King.

I've seen some other creepy things here and there, but that one takes the cake.  Thanks for reading.

1328518962.0,26,self.Thetruthishere,pczpr,[FAM&amp;ME]The lurker by the bedside.,,30,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/pczpr/fammethe_lurker_by_the_bedside/,"Since I was a child, I've always had very peculiar (not necessarily unexplainable) experiences. Coming from a Christian home, my family has more or less come to believe and accept that strange things happen around me, and for better or worse they deal with it. And in their case, they pray. This is but a side-note, however; a small little relic of background information to *hopefully* allow the full impact of what follows to sink in.

Before I continue, though, I should state that among my strange experiences, there has been a prevalence of night-terrors, some of which have been so intense that they actually wake up all the inhabitants of the household. They share a common trait, in that it typically involves my screaming and shouting in what I hesitate to call a ""language,"" but do so only because it differs from the typical incoherent dream-speak that so often accompanies these things; instead, these words are very intelligible, not mumbled, and are really just all around discomforting. It affects everyone around me, as it prevents them from proper sleep when it occurs as well.

So, the relation to my family. My brother's room is rather large compared to the other rooms in the house. He has a bed, but he also has room for small chairs and a futon-couch that he sometimes uses when his friends come over. And, from time to time, when he's up late playing video games or watching movies, he ends up falling asleep on that futon-couch instead of his bed. 

My brother and I are not particularly close, at least not emotionally, but he's confident enough in me that when strange things happen, he can speak with me about them. So he approached me one night, telling me he was frightened to go back to sleep. Since he woke me up, I didn't really understand what was happening. He waited until I gained more control of my mental faculties, and explained that something had come into his room. 

During this time period, it was very typical for my mother to enter our rooms before she left for work so that she could let our dogs go outside. So we were very used to the minor disturbance she'd cause by opening our doors and calling the animals. This particular night, he had fallen asleep on his futon-couch, and he told me that she opened the door and entered the room (which was rare: she usually just called the dogs from the doorway), shut the door behind her, and then stood over his proper bed for quite some time, just staring down at where he normally slept, but without moving or speaking or making any sound at all. 

Initially, he brushed it off as a waking remnant of a dream. However, as he came to himself, he said that she remained standing over his bed; as he fully awoke, he felt a deep and incredible fear, and something in him told him to keep silent and not try to get her attention. Something was wrong. After what he claimed to be a substantial period of time, the figure that appeared to be our mother began to seem less and less like her, and more and more like a living apparition from a nightmare, and it began muttering incomprehensibly, looking up and down the length of his bed, and eventually turning to look towards the futon-couch for some time before dissipating into the shadows.

How does this relate to my night terrors? Around this same period, I had begun experiencing a recurring nightmare, where a humanoid figure hunched upon all fours, lacking any eyes and only possessing nostril slits and a predatory mouth, would torment me in my sleep. I was not in the habit of sharing my nightmares with anyone, but I kept a private journal where I would sketch the figures I'd see or words I would hear during my states of sleep paralysis which inevitably followed my waking. 

When my brother explained to me the feeling of complete and abject fear that set in as this figure who feigned to be our mother slowly transformed into whatever it was that it is, my hair began to stand on end. I asked him if he could recall what it looked like, and he responded with a yes, saying that he could not ever forget it because of the horror it instilled within him. I asked him to describe it, and, if he could, sketch a picture. As he scrawled the figure, the fear solidified: a hunched, humanoid creature, walking upon all fours and lacking any eyes. 

I said nothing to him, and have kept my silence to this day. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_pczpr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/pczpr/fammethe_lurker_by_the_bedside/,

There are a lot of reasons for this decision, but the biggest was that I knew that at my mom’s, I would be given plenty of privacy, as she worked until late five days a week.  I was sixteen, had recently gotten my first steady boyfriend, and was convinced that having lots of sex with him was finally going to turn me into the adult I desperately wanted to be.  It didn’t work for obvious reasons, but we certainly had fun trying.

After a couple weeks of searching, Mom and I moved into a two-bedroom house a couple of miles from my Dad’s.  It was newly-refurbished, but had been built in the 20’s.  It had a very open layout; both the living room and the attic were big and stretched clear from the front of the house to the back, with stairs against the house’s rear wall.  My bedroom was in the attic, with a window at the front of the room, overlooking the yard and street, and a small vent in the floor directly above the front door.  It wasn’t actually connected to any air system, but was just a hole between the floors.  My mom and I often spoke to each other through it when one of us was upstairs. 

While we were getting settled, my new boyfriend, Alex, asked me to do him a small favor.  He was always a strange guy.  He had lived a borderline nomadic childhood all over the United States with his mother and siblings, and had a patchwork of interests and talents.  One of his more interesting quirks was his earnest belief in old European folklore, things like faerie rings and ghosts.  He had me fill several jars with dirt and place them at all entrances to my room – the door, the window, and the vent.  When I asked why, he seemed slightly sheepish, but said that according to legend, “spiritual nasties” would have to count each grain of dirt in the jar before they could gain entrance to an area.  

“How do you count a grain of dirt?” I asked.

“Exactly,” he said.

My mom had a new boyfriend around this time as well.  His name was Harry, and he was an older hippie.  I didn’t think much of him either way.  It hurt me a little that my mom had found someone to be with so shortly after breaking up with my dad, but I was a teenager and determined to not let anything affect me too much.  I acted cordially around him and he returned the favor.  We didn’t interact often.

A solid six months passed in the house without incident.  In February of 2010, my mom was out on a late date night with Harry while I sat on my computer in my bedroom.  Around 10:00, I heard the front door open and a little bit of talking.  Before too long, the talking stopped, I heard footsteps to my mom’s bedroom, and things eventually became quiet.  I figured Harry had gone home.  When I went downstairs, however, I heard a light snoring from my mom’s room, and peeked inside to see Harry curled in the bed with her.  It appeared that they had only fallen asleep together and nothing more, but something about the sight of it just crushed me.  That was supposed to be my dad’s head on the pillow next to Mom’s, not some stupid old guy who smelled like Patchouli.  


By the time I had stumbled back to bed, I couldn’t decide whether I was devastated or furious, so I went with both.  All the emotion I’d been trying to ignore since the divorce came pouring out of me in a teary river.  I sat up and sobbed and choked and screamed into my pillow.  I cried, for how long I don’t remember anymore, and eventually slipped down into my sheets, and kept crying until the tears petered out and I fell asleep on a wet pillow.

And then, at exactly 1:00 in the morning, something woke me up.

I remember that it was 1:00 because that was the first thing I saw when I opened my eyes.  I wasn’t groggy; I woke and was immediately fully conscious, stiff and angry, while directly in front of me my bedside clock read 1:00 AM.  After a few seconds, the noise that had woken me sounded again, and I found myself stiffening with annoyance.  It sounded sort of like a wooden flute or a recorder, playing just a single flat note for several seconds before falling slightly in pitch and ending.  The note was unremarkable, differing only in length each time it sounded, and there was no variance in its tone or any tremble of breath.  What the hell it was, I didn’t know, but it was loud, and it was coming through the vent that opened up downstairs.

I knew immediately that it was Harry.  Harry was being a stupid hippie and having some sort of weird flute ritual in our living room at one in the morning.  Fuck me.  I was filled with such livid anger that I wanted to storm downstairs and scream at him for waking me up, but something prevented me from leaving my bed.  I elected to close my eyes and ignore whatever shit he was getting up to, but the flute wouldn’t stop playing.  Every ten to thirty seconds it sounded again, for the same length of time, sounding exactly the same, and startling me awake again.  Every single time I heard it I felt angrier than I’d ever been, but I still didn’t leave my bed.  

In the sixth minute or so, a second noise seemed to join the first, this one much softer – a lower, longer note, like that of a muffled trumpet.  This one didn’t exactly sound like it was coming from the living room; it was more ambient, indistinct.  It played less frequently than the flute, but it, too, stayed on a single steady note every single time it sounded.  There was no pattern to either of the noises, though occasionally they did overlap; interestingly, at the times where they played simultaneously, they remained distinct in my ears and didn’t cover one another up for either volume or tone.  

For full minutes I just laid there and let myself be stabbed with tiny needles each time I heard these noises.  Gradually, though, they both began to play less frequently, and eventually the flute sounded once more on its own and then was silenced.  I waited for a minute, two minutes, waiting for it to come back, but it never did.  I opened my eyes again and looked at the clock.  The time was 1:10 in the morning.

I tried to fall back asleep, but the more I tried, the more I woke myself up, and the more awake I was, the angrier I became.  I should have gone downstairs and bitched at him to cut it out while it was happening.  Was I really so afraid of conflict that I wouldn’t even stand up to an old dork with a flute, who was doing something objectively rude in another person’s house?  I threw back my covers and put my bathrobe back on for warmth.  The air in the attic was chill and some bare light from the neighbors’ driveway was lighting up the inside of my curtains.  I scuffed over to the window and pinched open the blinds to look down on the street.

Harry’s van wasn’t there.

I blinked.  Harry never went anywhere without his van.  A strange feeling began worming its way into my stomach.  I hitched my bathrobe up a little more and headed for the stairs.  The living room was entirely dark and empty.

“Mom?” I called.

She was already partially awake.  She always wakes up about four times every night to use the bathroom.  With her bedroom directly next to the living room, there was no way she would have been unable to hear the very loud flute.  “Did you hear that?” I asked her.

“Hear what?” she asked, getting up to head to the toilet.

“That noise – is Harry still here?”

“No,” she said, and though she didn’t say anything about it, I thought there was something in her voice which said she was unhappy that I’d noticed his presence in the house.  “He left around midnight.”

“But you didn’t hear all that noise just now?”

“No,” she said.  “What noise?”

I went back to bed and didn’t fall asleep for a long time.

It wasn’t a terrifying experience for me – at least not at the time.  I was angry and defiant rather than curious, and I’m sure that it was nothing, but I still wonder what I might have found if I’d walked downstairs to see the source of the flute.  Alex had a strange look in his eye when I told him about it the next day.  He said, “It’s better that you didn’t go down.”

“Why, though?” I asked him.  “It was probably nothing.”

“Maybe,” he said.  “Or maybe it was a lure.”

 I try to be open-minded to the stuff he believes in, but I couldn’t help smiling a little at the idea.  “Really,” I said.  “Someone plays a flute to get me out of bed in the middle of the night.  Why?”  

He just kind of shrugged.  “You might too,” he said, “if your alternative was to spend all night counting grains of dirt.”

1374281736.0,23,self.Thetruthishere,1io3e0,But you were just there... [ME],malnormalish,32,9,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1io3e0/but_you_were_just_there_me/,"This happened five or six years ago, before I had a laptop. Our only computer was the family computer, placed in the middle of the living room next to the stairwell. Being about 14, I was always on the computer. The desk, like I said, was next to the stairwell facing the wall-- facing away from the front door and foyer. 

It was late afternoon, probably five or six. My sister was lacing her shoes about to go out to play with her friends for another hour before she had to come home. She asked me to come but I was chilling on the computer, so I declined. She walked out.

So I was by myself downstairs while my parents were up in their room watching television. A half hour after my sister left, I hear our very loud, creaky door swing open. Without turning around I say, ""Hey"".

My sister doesn't answer, but I hear her footsteps cross the room. I turn and see her going toward the stairs.

""What are you doing?"" I ask. 

""Going upstairs,"" she answers in this weird, flat, emotionless voice and does just that. I watch as she thuds upstairs and hear her open the door to her room and close it. 

Not five minutes pass-- I don't think much of it because there's not much to think about. Until the front door swings open.

I wheel around to see who is coming in since everyone who lives here is upstairs. But I am rendered speechless and stuck to my seat as none other than my sister walks in.

She kicks off her shoes and heads toward the stairs.

I finally snap out of it and jump out of the chair. I grab her arm. ""You just went up there,"" I told her. ""I saw you. I asked where you were going and you said upstairs, you went into your room!""

For context, my house is two-stories, which is obvious. But all of the windows in my house are sheer drops with no way to climb out of them. My sister had not come back down from her room in the five minutes I described, as the computer is right next to the stairs. I would've known, seen, and heard it all. 

She looked at me like I was crazy. ""I didn't come in until now. I'm going upstairs."" And she thudded up.

Well I am very shaken to say the least and immediately follow her, asserting that I had indeed witnessed her climb the stairs. I push past her and open her door, go into her room, only to find it empty. I ran back out and burst into my parent's room.

""You guys hear anyone come up here recently?"" I asked. Of course they said no.

I even checked my room, I was so sure. So paranoid that maybe it wasn't my sister, even though it definitely was. I heard her, saw her completely. No peripheral vision stuff, no double-takes, no shadows. She was solid, I looked at her steadily for about fifteen seconds. It was not late-night, I was not tired. I've gone over it so many times but I am certain I saw her walk up there.

Now that I think about it the apparition (as I've taken to calling it) was very shallow, lifeless. It's hard to explain-- like this tangible shadow of my sister. Like it was my sister but not really. I don't know if it's a ghost, but it scared the shit out of me. 

I told my sister, pretty much accused her of messing with me. But she was just as freaked out as I was. I've never experienced anything like it before and never have since, but my house has weird stuff like that happening in it a lot. I have no doubt that I saw something real. 

I might post more about some other stuff that has happened in my house (I've lived here for 11 years).

I'm a long time reader of this sub, first time poster. I'm hoping a few of you might find this story interesting because it's one of my favourite ghostly encounters. Anyway, here goes.

I was very shy growing up. I had an abusive home life so I was afraid of almost everyone, even close family members. It took me a long time to warm up to people.

My Grandfather scared me the most. He had a short temper and I often found it hard to distinguish between him being serious and joking, which resulted in me getting yelled at frequently. For this reason I avoided him and although other family members recall the better parts of his personality, I have only one or two good memories of him.

In 2003, when I was 12 years old, he died.
The night of the funeral I had a very distinct dream. I was walking down the long driveway to the paddocks where we keep our horses.
The walk was probably 2 minutes long and it wasn't like a normal dream where weird things happen, characters and places change quickly. In this dream we were walking in real time, in a familiar place, exactly as it would be in real life.


My grandfather was walking beside me, we walked slowly.
He said ""Norah, I know that you were afraid of me growing up and I know that we didn't have the best relationship. I'm sorry that I scared you, but I want you to know that I really did love you, even if I didn't show it. I'm sorry we couldn't have had a better relationship while I was still here.""
I don't remember saying anything, I just remember looking at him and occasionally glancing at my surroundings.
Once we reached the end of the driveway he stopped and said ""I have to go now, Norah. Just know that I love you.""

And then he just faded away. I woke up.

Of course, there's no way of proving that it was more than just a dream. But I take comfort in what he said and I'm glad I had one more happy memory.

I hadn't had anything happen in a long time when this occurred and it sort of opened a flood gate. Sorry if this is long.

My (now ex) boyfriend and I were not getting along with our roommates. They pretty much refused to clean anything and it got to the point that we were just always on each other's nerves. Every day was a fight. The stress was taking toll on our already rocky relationship. We decided to get a place of our own. We looked around and most everything we looked at was out of our price range since he wasn't working.

I found an apartment for rent in my budget online. We went to look at it and it was huge. It was bigger and less expensive than anything we had looked at. We asked why it was so cheap and the leasing agent told us that it was because the buildings were old and most people didn't consider them to be ""nice"" apartments because they lacked a lot of modern amenities. The buildings were built in the 40's to provide quick housing for World War 2 factory workers.

The buildings were solid block and concrete and naturally sound proof. You could vacuum at 3am and your neighbors would never hear you. The buildings were 3 stories tall and each floor had 3 apartments. They were all connected by a metal outside staircase. Each one had a huge window in the living room. 

We loved it and took it right then. We moved in that week. The boyfriend started a new job and we had lived there for about 2 months. Things weren't getting any better between us so I decided to call it quits. I had plans to move in with a friend as soon as her lease was up in 2 months. I was going to ride things out until then. I went to the Dr and got back on birth control because we had been trying for some time to have a baby. 

I moved in with my friend and shortly after found out I was pregnant in spite of the birth control. The boyfriend and I decided to try and work things out so I moved back in. 

I was about 8 weeks along. I was having really bad morning sickness. I'm talking the kind of puking where every time you move you puke. I tried to go into work but my boss took one look at me and sent me home. The boyfriend had to go to work shortly after I got back home. I stayed in bed for a bit but got to where I couldn't sleep anymore so I moved my trashcan and a blanket to the couch. I turned on the tv and started watching a movie.

About an hour or so into it I heard a knocking on the door. I figured it was a package and decided I didn't want to get up and answer it. I thought they would just leave it or leave one of the notes where we could pick it up later. About 15 minutes go by and the knocking starts again. I still don't want to answer the door. All my friends call or text before they come over so I knew it wasn't someone I knew. I just hoped they went away. 

20 minutes later the knocking started again. I figured it was someone from the apartment complex wanting to change the air filter or something. I get up not wanting to deal with any of this and look out the peep hole. I don't see anyone. I put it down to they got tired of waiting and go back to the couch.

As soon as I got settled the knocking happened again. I'm pissed off at this point. I go to the door look out the peep hole and see nothing. I open the door and don't see anyone. We were on the 1st floor but there was no where for a person to hide. If they had went up the stairs they were metal so I would have heard them and easily seen them. The only other place they could have gone was the parking lot which the front door over looked the whole thing. There was no one out there. I was a bit unnerved but shrugged it off. I went back inside.

I settled back onto the couch and within 10 minutes the knocking started again. I quickly jumped up and ran to the door and threw it open. There was no one there. I ran outside and looked all around. Nothing. I went back inside, threw up for a bit, and then called my best friend. She was worried about me because I wasn't at work. I told her what was going on and she told me to hang on and that she'd be right there. She left work and by the time she got there it had happened two more times.

She was there maybe 10 minutes before it happened again. We both opened the door and went out and looked. We both found nothing. We called my boyfriend and he came by on his lunch. it happened moments before he opened the door and walked in. He didn't see or hear anything walking up to the apartment. It didn't happen the whole time he was there and it never happened again. He thought we were both crazy and stormed off back to work.

When I was around 5 years old, I had this dream that I can remember very clearly. I was in a forest and I saw a fallen tree ahead of me. Beside the tree was a bucket. As I approached the tree and bucket, I became aware that there was something inside of the bucket. I leaned over and looked inside the bucket. There was a black liquid occupying the bottom. It spoke to me. It asked if I would like to be his friend. I was a little kid, so I said yes. I would like to be his friend. It started laughing at me and then I woke up. 

But I didn't really wake up, because I had no control of my body. I was watching myself rise out of bed. I knew that whatever was in my dream had taken control of my body. It took my body to the bathroom. It grabbed a box of matches. It lit a match and threw it into the trashcan. It then proceeded to stare into the mirror. My eyes were dead. I was terrified and could not move. My parents came in as the wall started to catch. I heard the words, ""Now we'll always be friends."" and then my mother grabbed me as my father put out the flames. A week later, my hair turned from blonde to brown. (This last part he mentioned because he had looked stuff up about it and it's a sign of possession?) 

From then on, 'sensitive' people will not come near me. A girl I was interested in who was sensitive told me that there was something dark in me, and she could not comfortably be around me. She said she could hear it. It obviously spooked her, but spooked me just as much. Any situation that seems like it will turn out good for me will turn to shambles in no time. I don't know what it is. I try to convince myself that it was all a dream. I ignore it as much as I can. 

My point of view now: I found this story fascinating, but wasn't sure if he was lying to give me a spook or what. Then one night he called me in the middle of the night and he was... crying. My friend, to say the least, wasn't a very emotional person. I never saw him cry even once in the 5 years that I had known him. He also sounded terrified. This is what he had to say to me...

Chris: It's here. I heard him! I'm at my mother's house. She asked me to watch over her house for the next few days. I've always hated this damn place. I always thought it was haunted. 

Me: What's wrong, what happened?

Chris: I decided to go to sleep in one of the spare bedrooms. I was in between sleep and reality. I heard something open the door and I suddenly felt a weight on my chest. My.. my demon was talking to the thing in this house. They were talking to each other! When they noticed that I could hear them, the weight sunk back into my chest, and then there was footsteps leading from my bedside to the door. It slammed the door as it left. I heard footsteps leading away from the door and then I called you. 

All together, pretty unsettling. I trust my friend, but I'd like to get some feedback from anyone here who might know what this thing is. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1ezntk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1ezntk/fr_will_you_be_my_friend/,

I've always wanted to witness something out of the ordinary.  Except for deja vu, the occasional weird vibe, or a handful of childhood experiences that can easily be filed under ""sleep paralysis,"" I haven't seen a damned thing.

I used to date a girl who'd tell me stories about things she'd seen.  She had lived in a haunted apartment, where the toilet would flush for no reason, and in which she'd heard a disembodied voice speaking to her in the dark. She and her brother had also seen Bigfoot on two occasions as kids.  I listened to her with an open mind, but also with a grain of salt.

Once when her brother came out to visit, he and I were driving along the beach, and I asked him about the Bigfoot story.

""Yep, it happened,"" he says.

""Wow,"" I say, ""that's really cool, I've always wanted to see something out of the ordinary like that, but never have-""

""Like that?"" he says, and points to the sky.

There's something hanging motionless over the ocean.  It's gunmetal grey and delta- or triangular-shaped, with a couple of round things that look like jet intake ports. In fact, it looks something like a fighter plane when viewed head-on, but not exactly. Very much like the ornithopter in the *Dune* movie, actually, but completely motionless.  I've seen helicopters and a Harrier when hovering - they are always adjusting for the wind.  I could see trees waving back and forth in the wind, but this thing was completely still.  Almost like it was painted on the sky.

I looked away, and when I looked back, it was still there.  I fixed eyes on it and it remained motionless, a few hundred yards out and maybe 500 feet up, until we drove out of line-of-sight.

My teacher starts off her confession by saying that she's really religious and a science teacher, but she still thinks the science building is haunted. 

She says that every night around 8:30 she hears footsteps going through the storage. (The science building is a rectangular building with classes on the outside the inside is a wide corridor that connects all the science classrooms and a bathroom. The internal area is big enough for storage) 

Anyways, at this point I'm just like ""bullshit, lady"". But then she goes on to tell us that her husband saw a shadow swoop by when he came to pick her up and followed the footsteps. Also, the custodians have also seen a black shadow swoop by in one of the classrooms. Some of our virus models have gone missing as well, and nobody admits to throwing them away. A couple days ago she heard the electronic paper dispenser in the bathroom go off, went to see, nothing there. Same thing some time later. Then when she is in there in the stall she hears it go off and when she comes out all the paper is all over the floor, like it was spitting paper. This isn't even the scariest part.

She said that sometime earlier she was sitting there thinking about the ghost and a light bulb firmly attached to its socket falls out and explodes. And as she finishes telling this to us, one of the lights in the corner of the room turns off. She gets up to go see and then a virus model falls off the ceiling right in front of her. She sits back down and then another light turns off. 

We stop talking about the ghost and go back to biology lol. 

My friends think I'm retarded but I knew where to come to share haha. I'm probably going to see what I can do to find out more. She has her suspicions about it being an old PE teacher who used to walk through there to get to the gym, and the custodians have reported seeing the shadow there too. 

Also, a second story real quick. One of my friends slept over in the quad and they were scared so they walked around for a bit. And as they passed the library window they saw a white figure sweep past it really quickly, she says it was a man.

One day, my friend and I were driving up a back road near my house, it was later in the night, around 9:30pm. We were just crusing listening to music. Something had caught my eye, I looked up by my rear view mirror and I saw a bright orb, it was right in front of my car, it had what looked like layers at the bottom, and arms reaching for us. It followed my car coming at me for a second or two. 
I asked Kenny if he saw anything, he explained what he saw and it was exactly what I saw. I drive past that spot everyday, I never saw anything after, never felt anything, nothing. But today, I drove past and I was stopped dead in my tracks feeling a terrible feeling. I felt sick. I went home that night to find my dog had passed away. I had asked Kenny to come over and stay the night, I just couldn't be alone. He had gotten my mind off things, and we had started talking about the orb. I told him I wanted to drive up there again, I felt our energy together might bring it back. Kenny was a little hesitant at first, but I finally got him to go. I honestly didn't think anything was going to happen, I've driven past that same spot everyday. As we were driving, we got closer to the spot and started to get a little nervous, almost as soon as we hit the spot, we saw an orange-ish orb, it was smaller, and it was in front of my car and went around to the driver side of the car. I couldn't believe that after seeing what we saw the first time, we actually saw something again. I just don't know how to understand this. I've always had an intrest in paranormal, but I've never really had an experiance to make me believe in it. I've always been on the fence, and now after this, I just don't know what to think.

My favorite holiday is Halloween, so I thought we should do something fun like go to a party or a zombie walk, but she was scheduled to work until 10:30 at a coffee shop. I decided to hang out with some friends and look online for some legitimately haunted places in Phoenix. I found a few that sounded cool and then ran across one at Jefferson Park in Mesa. We had to check it out because I had gone to Jefferson Elementary as a kid (the school is located just a bit north of the park).

The story of the haunting on the website told of a young girl who had been raped and murdered at the south end of the park near Broadway Road in the early 90s. I sort of remember hearing about this when I was a kid, but my family lived on the other side of the freeway in a better neighborhood, so they weren't very concerned.

My wife (girlfriend at the time) and I got to the park around 11 pm and sat on the swings talking until around 1:30 am. I decided the story was total BS and told her we should go home. Right then (no shit, RIGHT THEN) we both saw a female walking along the southwestern edge of the park. There were no streetlights on that end of the park, so she was pretty shadowy. She was also walking ridiculously fast. It seemed sort of normal, but there was something odd about it.

Finally, we realized that she had no gait! It was like she was sliding or floating very quickly along the sidewalk. Now it gets a little weirder. There are streetlights on the southeastern edge of the park, but when she got there she was still shadowy! She turned north and walked up Jefferson Avenue and we watched her until she was occluded by a building.

We ran to the car to try to drive past whoever we saw to make sure it wasn't just a worker on her way home, but there was no one down Jefferson Ave. We looked and then drove down each street coming off Jefferson and still saw no sign of any walker.

Sooooo I guess I'm open for suggestions on how to get this thing afloat, and if anyone has experience with this please comment or message the mods! 

Do we nominate stories or just add the top ones or what? I don't use e-books so I don't even know what I'm talking about, quite frankly.

Also, if anyone else has any ideas for the sub unrelated to ebooks, feel free to comment here. Let's get some projects in motion!

**edit** Ideas for e-book: 

* Free of charge!
* User nominated stories.
* Chapter breaks for each part of the world, so people can read about experiences from various countries in one chapter.
* When we gather permission from authors, we will also ask where the experience took place if not mentioned in story.
* Each contributor will be filled in on the process so you will have final say in how your spelling, grammar, punctuation, and formatting is edited.
* First four tags will be included, though not mentioned in title. **Title**/User/*Tag*/*Location*.
* Since we're a year old, if this works, we can make a new one each year for new stories!

**Oh! Please note there is a change to the [HW] tag.** It used to be for the mods to assign homework assignments if there was ever a lull, but we never actually did that. At any rate, I rewrote the tag so that anyone can request a topic to either jog memories or encourage people to seek out stories. You all have free reign to do so whenever the mood strikes. Other than asking people to ask those they know, you could ask people to find an encounter online and explain to us why you believe it, or whatever you feel like requesting. As long as it relates to something you believe to be true, I'd say anything goes. Users can either reply in the comments with their findings or create a new thread, most likely double tagged like [HW/FoF] or something.

I've told this story to a handful of people in my life, but it's not exactly something you bring up in casual conversation, nor is it something that the people I tell could ever add to in the way of meaningful analysis. This is something that has effected me greatly throughout my life, and I've always wanted to delve deeper into the exact meaning of why it happened, but alas, there are precious few people on this planet that could really point me in the right direction. I hardly think I could find that on /ufos, so maybe someone here might have some insights?

I am currently 28 years old. The events of this story happened when I was 7, 8, and 9 years old. The sight of a Gray (the alien) still sends my body into a fight or flight mode. Adrenaline kicks in, my breathing becomes heavy and rapid, and my heart begins to race. I am a very cerebral individual, and whenever I experience this feeling, I tell myself that it's completely illogical and unnecessary, as I'm only looking at a picture, or a TV screen or some such. My body still disagrees. 

It began in 1991, on Christmas Night (not Christmas Eve, but the evening of December 25th, after all the presents were opened and whatnot). My family and I had just moved out to the middle of nowhere, Virginia, about 30 minutes outside the capital, Richmond. I had lived my previous 7 years in the city, and was used to a more suburban environment. I remember not liking the idea of other kids not being around, but overall was excited about having a large place to run around and play.

At night, I always slept with my blinds up when we lived in the city, and since the move in August, this habit had not changed. My room was on the second floor, and if you can imagine a reversed ""L,"" like, ""_I"" my window would be the underscore, and the other section of the house that I could see through my window would be the 'I.' My bed was pressed against the wall, parallel to the underscore, with  my head being on the far side away from the 'I.' This is important because I never saw a craft, only lights, and they were reflecting off the 'I.' (I hope this paints an accurate enough picture...)

It was around 10PM, and everyone had gone to bed after the holiday festivities. I remember briefly looking over to my right, where the door to my bedroom was open and the hall light was on. I then look over to my left and out of the window, and reflecting off of the side of the house I see a circle of light, roughly three feet in diameter. Imagine a spotlight pointing directly on it, not at an angle, and remember I'm on the second floor of the house. It was not just one ""spotlight,"" though, as whatever was making the light was rotating, and behind that one circle of light, another followed, and then another. It was never stationary, always spinning.

At this point you can imagine my 7 year old self was quite terrified. There's nothing that I knew of then, nor can I think of now that could cause what I was seeing.

Being scared out of my mind, I did what any 7 year old would do at the time. I slowly pulled the covers over my head.

From then I have no memory. This of course makes no sense to me, because I know that my adrenaline was pumping harder than it probably ever had in the past, and you don't just fall asleep in those situations. Nor do I have any memory of hiding under the covers for hours. It's just... nothing. And then the next morning.

Needless to say, I never slept with the blinds open again. What's strange was that, while I had no other encounters the rest of the year, I knew that as Christmas approached in 1992, I could expect to see those lights again, and I did. This time, of course, the blinds were down, but there was no hiding those lights, they were just too bright.

This occurred one more, final time in December of 1993, on Christmas night again.

I of course told my parents, and begged them to tell me they had played some kind of trick on me. They're still open enough to talk about it, because it was such an important thing to me, and to this day they swear up and down they have no idea what I was talking about, and while they don't particularly believe in alien visitation themselves, they had seriously thought about getting me some kind of help because they could tell I had obviously been through something traumatic.

This is still a series of events that I think about often, and as I go through my adult life try and find some meaning in. I haven't had much luck so far. I still have nightmares about Grays and UFOs if my wife isn't with me (I must have trained myself not to have them when she's with me, either because of the comfort of having her around, or because I knew I needed to stop flailing in my sleep if I was ever going to keep a woman... probably a combination of the two).

This is the reason I believe in the alien abduction phenomena, and why no amount of reasoning from a skeptic will ever convince me otherwise. I understand the ridiculousness of an alien race traveling millions of miles just to abduct kids in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. It makes zero sense. I don't understand it. But that doesn't change what I saw, and it doesn't explain the years of nightmares and other side effects that sound like PTSD.

Anyway, that's my story, and I wanted to post it somewhere. I'm particularly interested in people who've had similar experiences, as I've never met anyone else who's been ""abducted"" (that I didn't immediately think was a crackpot, I mean).

This all happened to me when i was in 3rd or 4th grade. A little back story. My parents are both from El Salvador and we still have a lot of family over there. I have gone almost every other summer since i was 3.

I don't have many memories of that time but i have never forgotten this dream. It starts off with me riding in a truck and i can tell we are in El Salvador. Its my aunts husband truck and hes driving. My aunt is in the passenger side and i am riding in the middle. We pull up to a small house with lots of people and cars. I notice that there is a lot of family members there. 

We walk in together. I notice a casket in the back of the living room. I had never seen one in person but i knew what it was. At first i wasn't sure if i should go up to it but i was curious. As i am walking towards it i am just about to look in when my mom wakes me up. 

I thought that was a weird dream. So i just brushed it off as nothing to worry over. About 2 weeks later my mom wakes me up in tears. It was maybe 5 in the morning. She tells me i am not going to school that day. I ask why and she tells me that my grandpa had died. It didn't really hit me there. I was just a kid and didn't really understand death yet.

We flew that day to El Salvador and went to my other grandparents house. The day of the wake a few family members were there. As we got ready to go they decided i would ride with my aunt and her husband. As we were riding i got this chill down my spine. I felt like i had been there.

We got to the wake and everything felt like it had happened before. Seeing my family, walking into the house, everything. I walked up to the casket and looked into it. The moment i looked into my grandpas face it hit me. That dream, all this happened in my dream. I was in shock. I didn't talk much the rest of the day. 

I never told anyone for years. I have told a few people since then but most just say ""wow that's weird"" or something along those lines. Ive had other dreams that came true but never anything as serious as my grandpas wake.

My dad came into my room to tell me about it, and we went outside to watch the rain. While we were out there, he told me a story that he's told me ever since I was little. Its a true story that happened to him, and he says it saved his life. I'd like to share it with you guys now.In his late teens, my dad was in the military in El Salvador. He was in the air force, but he also worked around a military base/outpost a little bit before that. On this particular night, it was storming hard. Rain was pouring down hard from the dark skies, much like it is now (at least where I live). He was ~19 at the time, and he was told to guard one of the gates of the base. It was an outpost much like you see in the movie, where my dad stood was on a high platform - there was one on each corner of the base. They had spotlights and everything. It was somewhere around 2am, and my dad was keeping guard, but he was freezing because of the storm. He was sopping wet too, and was shivering violently. As he stood there under the small make-shift plastic roof on the platform, holding his rifle in his arms, he felt like his body began to freeze and numb. Starting from his feet slowly growing up to his chest, he was slowly freezing. He said he thought he was going to die right then and there. As he was shivering more and more violently from the cold, he said he saw a dark figure walk toward him from the darkness. It was an old man, wearing some sort of hat. He had a white styrofoam cup in his hand, and my dad could make out steam coming from the cup. The mysterious old man reached out and offered the cup to my dad, and he took it. It was something hot. He drank from it and he quickly regained his energy, he became aware of what just happened and put the cup aside and clutched his rifle.He fired 3 shots into the air, and promptly after the other guards showed up. He explained what he had saw and a search was underway. They searched all around the base and found no one. No sign of the old man anywhere. But my dad looked at the white styrofoam cup and knew he hadn't imagined it.To this day, my dad has no idea who that old man was, but he believes him to be an angel who saved his life. He tells me that he's come to the conclusion that if that man hadnt appeared to him, he would have died right there.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_tcdjp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tcdjp/famthe_old_man_who_saved_my_dads_life/,

Only recently was it sold.  It was the family home for twenty-two years.  The house is two stories, and over a century old.  There is no central heating, and the upstairs was never quite finished.  One of the upstairs windows was broken, the ceiling leaked, and in the summer it was always about fifteen degrees hotter than the temperature outside.  There were not even any lights.

I was always uncomfortable up there, and in the eighteen combined years I spent at that house I can count on my fingers the number of times I actually went up there, and almost every one of them was during the day.  It wasn't scary, it just had an unsettling feel to it.  None of us used it, so the house may as well have been one story.

It was the summer, I was fifteen, and I was waiting on my friend to come over to spend the night.  My dad wasn't worried about funny business, because we were sleeping in the living room, my brother was going to be there, and my dad is an extremely light sleeper.  We were planning on just staying up, the three of us, and just hanging out.

While I'm waiting for my friend to show up, it starts to get cloudy outside, and I can hear thunder.  I look at the clock, and it is about the middle of the evening.  I do not remember the exact time it was then, but I know exactly how much time passed before I looked at the clock again.

After I checked the clock the first time, I seemed to zone out.  It wasn't quite sleep, but like one of those semi-dreams you have when you're laying down but before you actually pass out.

My friend and I were walking into the room with the stairway, and we turned on a flashlight.  We closed the door behind us and started walking up the stairs.  I can hear the thunder outside, and I'm begging him not to go upstairs.  I can't let him go alone, so if he goes I have to go.  I'm trying to convince him to come back downstairs with me, but he won't listen.

We reach the top of the stairs, and there is this brilliant flashing of lightning outside.  The thunder claps hard enough to jar the house.  We turn into the room at the top of the stairs, and when my friend shines the flashlight in there are two brief flashes it goes over.  I scream as the two flashes are revealed to be red eyes on a large black dog.

The scream doesn't even finish, the dog leaps at us and cuts me short.  The last I remember of this is laying on the ground with my throat crushed and bloodied, and my friend being attacked.

Then I open my eyes, and look around.  I'm sitting where I was before, but now I'm shaken.  Understandably, I hope.  I look at the clock again.  Only one minute has passed.  The storm hasn't even fully arrived yet.

The evening is uneventful until my friend arrives.  I don't know what I was thinking at the time, but I wound up telling him about what I saw.  He got this big grin on his face and told me we should go check it out.  My heart sank.  He pulled a flashlight out of his bag, and I knew there wasn't any stopping him.

I told him I needed to get a drink of water first.  While I was getting my drink, I prayed.  I prayed for safety, I prayed for protection, I prayed that nothing would happen.

When I returned, he said my brother was sitting it out, so we entered the room with the stairway and closed the door behind us.  It was dark, except for the occasional flash of lightning and the flashlight itself.  We start up the stairs, and like before I was asking him to reconsider, to go back downstairs.  Like before, he didn't listen.

When we got to the top of the stairs, I closed my eyes and braced.  I knew what was going to happen.  The bright flash was enough that I could still register it with my eyes closed, and the house did tremble with the clap of thunder.  He laughed at me, he didn't notice I was preparing for that.

Then we turned to the room in question, or the door anyways.  The door was closed.  He reaches out ot the knob and tried to turn it, but it was locked.  He tried a few more times before giving up, and we returned downstairs.

I didn't sleep easy after that.  By morning the storm had passed.  I asked my dad when he had closed the door upstairs, and he looked at me funny.  He told me he had never closed the door.  This freaked me out, but my friend just felt curious, and wound up dragging me back upstairs.

The door was open, just as it had always been before.

That door should not have been closed, let alone locked.  No one ever went up there to close any of the doors, let alone lock them.  Not since we moved in, and not until my dad finally moved out.  Twenty-two years and no one had ever bothered.

Yet for one night, that door was mercifully closed for me, and I have no explanation for it.

I had Contra, Super Mario Bros, bat man games, ninja turtles and a few others, but eventually me and my brother had beat all of the games we had and we started trading with our friends. My memory is hazy, but I remember one of my friends gave me one of those cartridges with a bunch of games on it, all of them sucked. After going through most of the games and not enjoying a single one I decided to take out the cartridge to replace it with something else. When I took it out the screen started playing a loop of some game that I recalled seeing at my friend's house, but never actually played or even talked about. The weirdest part was the game wasn't on the cartridge I had just pulled out and looked like a game that would have it's very own cartridge. The loop had no sound and was like the first level or something playing over and over again, it was pretty long though. To describe the game seems impossible to me at this point, I just dont remember. It was a platformer that took place in what looked like a underground dungeon or something, the guy playing was collecting keys if I recall correclty. At first I though my NES had somehow connected to my friend's NES and I was watching him play, I was really young cut me some slack. After getting tired of the loop I wanted to stop it, I clicked the restart button, but nothing happened the loop just continued. At this point I was really having fun with it, for some reason it wasnt scary at all. Next I went and unplugged the game adapter, but the TV was still running and like you might have guessed the loop didn't stop, changing the channels worked, but when I went back to the channel that my NES was usually on the loop was still playing.

I lived really close to this store, so I started to walk home.

  I was crossing the parking lot when I felt a hand on my shoulder, stopping me in the middle of a parking lot, and I heard Nick tell me to watch out.  This happened simultaneously as a car sped past me, an inch from hitting me.  I'm convinced that he knew I was going to get hit and saved me.

We have a number of sightings and experiences throughout our history.  Here are a couple.

It's an old, colonial house built in, I believe, the mid 1600's.  My great grandfather bought it when my grandmother was a kid, and before he bought it it had been owned by another family since it was built.  He decided to do some renovations on it when they moved in.  One thing that he decided was to move the staircase from one room to a different room.    There was a door at the top of the stairs that was open, and the construction workers needed it closed so they closed it.  However, it reopened immediately.  This happened several times.  Exasperated, they literally nailed it shut then took a lunch break.  When they came back, it was open again.  They left and refused to return.

Shortly after moving into the house, my great grandparents had a daughter.  She very unfortunately passed away at only a year and a half of, I believe, sudden infant death syndrome.  When I was a baby, around the age she was when she died, my mother would often hear a baby crying, go check on me, and find me sleeping.  Fast forward several years, my sister, my niece (also about a year and a half) and I are sitting in the living room.  My niece is laughing about something, very happy, when I hear a baby cry from upstairs.  I thought I was just hearing things, but I looked at my sister and she asked me if I heard it, too.

When my younger brother was about 2 years old, my mother was a stay at home mom, and she was in her bedroom working on something about 40 minutes before I came home from school (I was about 7).  My brother was playing in the playroom that was just outside of my mom's room, he was out of sight of my mother but she could hear him.  There was no one else in the house.  All of a sudden my brother starts asking my mother who the man in the room is.  She called him into her room and didn't move until someone else came home.  When she was about 9, she remembers seeing an old man dressed in a plaid shirt in the same room he was in, as do several of my grandmother's siblings when they were young.  Also, when my nieces were younger they used to ask similar questions to my brother's, though one described him as a scary man.

I was upstairs by myself one day when I was probably between 10 and 12. I was in my brother's room for some reason, playing with this little Fisher Price drum he had, and I played a random tune on it. Immediately after I played it I heard the exact tune played back to me from above me in the attic. There was no one on the second or the third floor of the house but me.

Now, my siblings and I all knew about the presences in our house, and we also knew they weren't malevolent, as they never hurt us.  My sister used to ask them, at night, to show themselves to her.  One morning she woke up at 1:00 AM and saw the head (only the head) of a man with a black wide brimmed hat hovering over her.  She turned on the light and he vanished.  She told my father about it the next day, who's not the type of man to believe in these things, but before she described the man to him he told her he'd seen a man in a black wide brimmed hat with a black cloak in the playroom.

When my mother was growing up, she lived in a different house, but one that was also haunted.  There was a third floor bedroom, and one of the beds in it would often shake for no discernible reason as they were trying to sleep.  However, it would stop if you told it to.  Except for one night when it drove my tough-as-nails drill sergeant aunt to tears in its refusal.

My grandfather had a brother who was struck by lightening and died at about 21.  One night, as he and my grandmother were trying to sleep, he felt that he was being tickled and kept telling my grandmother to stop.  However, she wasn't touching him.  She felt that it was my great-uncle in their room that night, just telling my grandfather he was okay.

Also, one day, my grandmother was driving with all of her kids in the car when my mom was a kid.   She turned down a road that they didn't frequent.  My uncle turned to her and said, ""I hate coming down this road.  I wish we didn't have to go down here.""  He had never been down the road before.  It was the road that my great-uncle had been struck by lightening on.

Back then, we used to go to Spain for months at a time, I spent a large portion of my life there, and had some very close friends from throughout the years. One of them was my best friend Juan Jose.

Every summer we'd play a lot. We'd do everything from fishing, to playing soccer on a daily basis, I have many fond memories and experiences. His grandfather was a great guy, funny, compassionate, and kind. He would let us in the storage room which had countless toys and games and we'd spend hours at a time over there.
Like every summer, I would come back to America, bitter that I'd have to spend the rest of the year in this country. I always couldn't wait to go back, but life is life.
My dad has always gotten up early to go to work, usually at around 6 in the morning. Growing up, when he'd wake up for work, I'd wake up to take his spot on my parents' bed, which was always so much bigger and more comfortable than my bed.

On one occasion, I awoke on a sunny weekend morning. It was one of those abrupt wakings where you are kind of confused still. I looked over and my mom was sleeping. As if my gaze jolted her, she immediately woke up.
Her nerves were on end, she was shaking and tears were forming in her eyes. I watched a tear roll down her cheek as she was trying to maintain composure.

""He's must be gone,"" she told me. I had no idea what she was talking about.

""Who's gone? What are you talking about?"" I responded.

""Juan Jose's grandfather. Something is terribly wrong, I had a dream where I knew he was dead. Something's really wrong.""

I tried to comfort her and tell her it was only a dream. After all, dreams can't hurt you right? Dreams are just dreams.

She was pacing around the house nervously for the next hour. She was mumbling to herself from time to time, trying to rationalize what happened. I thought it very strange, but as the afternoon unfolded, i quickly understood.

She called my grandmother in Spain. She does this about once a month, mostly to check up on the house we have there, to make sure the bills are being paid, and just to check up on the family. As she called, my grandmother picked up.

""You're never going to believe what happened yesterday.."" my grandmother anxiously told my mother.

""Did Manolo die?"" Asked my mother, already expecting the answer.

""Yes...how did you...did someone tell you?"" wondered my grandmother.

""I had a dream last night, mom. You know the ones I'm talking about. I saw his wife mourning at a church, she was telling me something was terribly wrong, that it wouldn't be alright. In my dream I was trying to comfort her. I kept telling her everything's going to be okay, and she was telling me that it couldn't be okay, that it was too late."" my mom responded.

And just like that, it was confirmed. I had witnessed this one from the moment she woke up, watched her nervously anticipate the events, hoping she would be wrong. Unfortunately, she wasn't wrong. I watched the look on her face twist as she realized that what she experienced was a reality.
A humbling experience, to say the least.

Would like feedback on what they might be.,Changing_shapes,26,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/m8dut/dis_a_list_of_various_psychic_phenomena_i_see/,"I can't remember exactly when I started to see these things but I can say it's been at least 4yrs+ that I've seen them. It all began in 10th grade when I dabbled in meditation and tried to see auras. I would observe my hands for 30 minutes at a time until after a month of casual effort I began to see something. It was a white transparent layer that traced along my body. From then on I would stare long enough until a dark blue color would emerge from my body.

Around this time I also began to see what I can describe as ""mist"" floating in the air. If you were to look at a room, the air and space would be filled with transparent static that would move in random waves. Almost like watching vapor rise. Anyway, this psychic phenomena would soon grow to 7 distinct phenomena. 

I'd like to clarify that I've never done drugs/have a mental illness/ or some medical eye problem. 

1. Sparkles- A twinkle that is normally seen on a clear sky but can be seen in dark lit rooms. Usually just a split second long but can sometimes trail along slowly for a full second ( one time it traveled the length of my left arm). Appearance can be described as throwing glitter into the air and watching it ""sparkle"". I also call them rainbow ants as they seem to shift between a multitude of colors while I see them.

2. Sand/Mist waves- Waves that can be seen in the air?space. They have a transparent appearance that moves rhythmically in fast or slow waves. I describe it as seeing the energy of objects around me or the particles present in the air. Can be seen clearly against back backgrounds and will persist for as long as my vision is steady.

3. Rainbow Blob- Started seeing them around 9/?/10. I describe it as seeing a Photoshop grunge brush that is both rainbow in color but transparent. I see it usually along with repeating numbers on the clock etc. I have a feeling they are them embodiments of good spirits.

4. Clouds- Are a thicker variation of mist waves. They move fast and with purpose. I think it's a spirit. It can vary in size from a shoe box to 4ft high (so far as Ive seen anyway). Are also fleeting in duration, lasting only a second and are opaque-ish white. 

5. Orbs- Fast little things I see dashing around the room. Haven't seen them outside yet. Are colorless and very quick.

6. Shimmer- Sometimes when I stare intently at an area it will shimmer. Like a portal in the movies or gas that slightly distorts the focus. Feels like it's the veil of reality or maybe a peek into the next dimension.

7. Blue Dot- Will see a blue dot where my third eye would be when I close my eyes. 

I'd like to add that I'd had one unsuccessful but very close OBE and one very short lucid dream which I thankfully recorded :) Umm oh I sometimes get the instinct to look at my watch or at certain cars' license plates and I'll see 222 12:12 12:34 etc I can also tell time accurately without looking at a clock and have felt tingly sensations when contacting spirits and sometimes intuitively know of other people's distress.

So has anyone experienced any of the above? What the fuck is all this?

He didn't like talking about it, but he had mentioned something about it.

A little background. My family lives in our own house in what used to be a suburb and is now a small city. We've been here at least 16 years, and there's never really been anything 'crazy' in the house, but there have been isolated incidents such as the one I will tell.
It must have been a night in October, when the fall is around and it's not really cold yet, but it's not warm enough to leave windows open or anything. The windows in my house were all closed, so there was no 'draft'. Anyway, even with windows and doors open, the doors inside the house have NEVER opened or closed without a human hand assisting.
So I was a little bit tired and decided to go to bed since it was a weeknight. I closed my door, got changed, and lay in bed for a little. I noticed my bedroom door opened to about an inch, and closed slightly, leaving it only a crack open. Just like that.
Almost immediately I heard a panting sound. Some heavy breathing make its way from the door, past the foot of my bed. Suddenly, the breathing turned from the foot of my bed, along the length of my bed getting closer and closer.


I could hear it closer with each coming second. I heard it to the point where it was right by my face, and I felt a pressure on my neck. I couldn't speak up or scream, and breathing was difficult. Within a few seconds the pressure eased, and the breathing started distancing itself again.


The breathing made its way along the length of my bed, distancing itself more, around the foot of my bed again. The door opened up again to about an inch, and it closed again, as if being pulled by a vacuum/draft of movement, but the door actually came to a close.


When the door closed I darted up and turned on the light. It wasn't sleep paralysis, as I had been laying down only a couple of minutes after getting changed. This is the same room and bed that my brother had had the same thing happen to him years before. I hadn't thought of the incident since he had told me years before, and I had not been in the 'scary movie' mindset from watching a horror movie or anything.

The only difference in his case was that the presence was holding his arm down, and he was able to struggle and fight it slowly raising his arm as it was being pushed down.

I went to the kitchen to get my girlfriend a snack and myself a drink. I felt really odd, as though someone were RIGHT behind me. I began making a PB&amp;J(what a lucky lady my gf is) when suddenly I heard footsteps coming from my room into the kitchen. They were very soft, feminine steps, so I figured it was my girlfriend; they kept coming and stopped right behind me and I waited for arms to wrap around my waist...then they started to recede back to where they had come from. I turned around and no one was there as I took the food and walked into my room. I asked her if she had moved or heard anything. She hadn't.


9-9-2011 - 2:00am:


I stood up and went to go hop in the bath. Me and my girlfriend were having an altercation and it wasn't going well for either of us so I decided to take a hot bath to calm down since the fight was stupid anyways. I couldn't stay in the bath for more than 5 minutes until I dried off and walked back in my room. I came upon my girlfriend, shivering, laying in a puddle of her own sweat, crying. I kneeled down and asked her what was wrong, thinking it was from the fight, when she asked where I had gone. I told her I was in the bath, and she told me she had an encounter. She was laying there in my bed when suddenly it felt as though I had punched right above her head on the pillow; she jumped and asked ""me"" what was wrong, and a cold cold voice answered ""you.""

Couldn't sleep at all for I had taken WAY too much medicine. It was a really bad day with my brain condition and I am out of my normal medicine, so I had to take about 5 Fuerocets, which are packed with caffeine (which I haven't had in years.) So naturally I'm up all night long thinking of things to do when I decide I can lay back and attempt sleep. My girlfriend has claimed my right arm as her pillow so I turn off the TV with the left and plunge my room into semi-darkness, save the light on my DVR. It's strange, watching the shadows play infront of you while the DVR light pulses...it makes you imagine things. I didn't imagine the quick whispering coming from my side of the room minutes after shutting off my TV. No sleep.


9-13-11 - 3:20pm


I've decided to set up a microphone in my room to record all night tonight. I would have last night, but my GF said she didn't want to be in the house when I do it. I'm using a B-20 Studio Mic, the same one I use to record vocal tracks...so if anything happens, I should get it.


9-17-11 - 1:17am


I walked into the bathroom to go brush my teeth and I'm feeling like shit; my head is split open and I just took medicine so that I could sleep from the pain. I came back, walking through the dark to my bedroom, and as I walked in to my dark bedroom, my girlfriend is laying on the bed, feverishly beckoning me towards her. I lay down and ask what's wring as she curls into me, and she quickly tells me that a few minutes after I left the room with the door open, a shadow had darted across the wall infront of her. This doesn't make any sense, because there's literally NO light coming from outside the door, and the only light in my room was from my DVR and iPad, both were facing at a point that couldn't have castes that shadow. No sleep tonight.

2:00 am
My gf just shook herself to sleep in my arms. There's no way I can use my computer tonight without waking her, so I'm using a voice recording app on my iPad through the night. Btw, I know Reddit loves trolling somewhat and most of the stories on NoSleep are folk tales...but I can't stress enough how real this is. Not Marble Hornets real. Real.


9-17-11 - 5:30pm


I've been searching through the 3 recordings that I left running the past 3 nights. The first 2 were done on my desktop computer, using a B-1 Studio Mic, ProTools and Mixcraft, and showed no evidence. Then last night, I used GarageBand on my iPad, which shown to be an extremely sensitive mic and app. After sifting through 10 hours of night sounds on wavelength, this showed up:

I have NO idea what this is. My iPad rests less than a foot to the left side of my face when I sleep...so I'd love to learn that it was just an awkward snore. Please?

I just realized it was dinner for my dogs, so I let them out to eat. I came back in to my empty house (save for 3 cats) and walked into my room. I went around to the left side of my bed and that's when I heard it. It sounded like a mixture between scratching nails on wood and laughter. whatever the fuck made that noise scared the shit out of me, and when I whirled around, I saw my hat rack rocking softly back and forth as if someone had bumped it. I noped all the way outside with my dogs.

1315425935.0,24,self.Thetruthishere,k7y9p,The Man in my Room (Kinda long-ish...),spacepod,25,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/k7y9p/the_man_in_my_room_kinda_longish/,"Hey all! This is my first post to r/thetruthishere. I’ve been getting more and more into reading people’s paranormal experiences since I found this subreddit and r/nosleep. I’ve had quite a few encounters myself, so I decided you might want to hear the most intense experience I’ve had. 

Some background:
My parents moved to the country when I was very young. The area where they grew up was now becoming industrialized and my dad, who is an avid outdoorsman, decided to move our family somewhere that would allow us kids to play in the woods. The house we moved into was an ancient Victorian farmhouse on a generous plot of land. During the golden years of the house, it was used as a bed and breakfast and had quite a number of visitors. The house was midsize compared to the McMansions of today, including two baths, five bedrooms, a reading room, a smoking room, formal dining room, pantry, kitchen, mudroom, and the long hallways to connect it all. The attached carriage barn was converted into more living space later on and I never felt anything within this new space, only in the older sections of the house. I have had countless encounters because of this place, and when I visit, I don’t like to stay for long because it is still very active. 

I was about 15 or 16 at the time, and my room was moved into the smallest of the bedrooms because I was really creative and as an “arteest” I couldn’t clean the project up until “my masterpiece” was finished. Having type-A parents, shoving me into the smallest room guaranteed them that my mess would be well contained and not leak out….(or something like that.) This room was a nightmare. It had one window, and a small closet that I stacked full of fabrics and other creative supplies. When moving into this room, I slept on a metal day bed with a trundle underneath. I had slept on that bed frame without any trouble since I was six or seven. A couple of months after moving into this room, I became increasingly depressed. I would sleep for entire days if I wasn’t prodded into leaving the house. On a number of occasions, I would sleep for 20 hours straight. This sleep was most often black and dreamless, which is very odd because I have always been a active and imaginative dreamer. That wasn’t all, though. Batteries wouldn’t last a day in the room. I noticed this after using the family digital camera to take some photos of my artwork. I replaced the batteries with new lithium ones, and then the next day they were shot. I thought it was odd, but these things didn’t really concern me until the man showed up. 

One night, I was sleeping my sound 10-15 hour usual night, but this time I awoke early. It must have been about three or four in the morning. I was upset because I was incredibly tired and all I wanted to do is go back to sleep. I adjusted my covers and rolled over to face the room rather than the wall. I looked up to the window, and noticed a part of it seemed like it was covered. This was really odd, because I didn’t have hanging curtains, only a valance at the top. It was a pretty dark night, but the moon had been out, so I could clearly see that something was in my room that hadn’t been when I went to sleep. I couldn’t see all of whatever it was because my closet door had been left ajar and obscured me from seeing all of what was there. At first I had thought it was my older brother who had snuck in to play a nasty trick on me. I quickly realized that it wasn’t. As a whole my family is quite short and this thing was as tall as the door, so maybe six feet? I was really creeped out so I turned over and tried to sleep. Eventually I did.

These visits became nightly. I became used to the tall dark thing that chilled out in my closet. I barely noticed that the shadow was slowly moving its way out. I began to see details of him, though I wasn’t scared at this point. He was a tall older man who usually wore dark slacks and a white button up shirt that didn’t have a collar. Most of the time I could only see a sliver of it because he also wore a jacket, but nothing fancy. He had a long face that showed age and a short traditional haircut. He may have been graying, but it’s been so long I can’t remember all the details. His eyes were incredibly sad and deep set. He never moved when I saw him. He just stood there, looking sorrowful. It was almost heart wrenching just letting him stay there, but I was cautious and never left my bed while he was standing there. 

About two or three month after the initial visit, and when he reached the middle of my small room, I started getting bruises. Lots of them. Everywhere. The first few I got where on my legs. I wasn’t too concerned, I figured I had a bad dream I didn’t remember and kicked my bed frame. Though now thinking about it, it’s highly improbable considering all the pillows and stuffed animals I used to sleep with. Then I started getting them on my arms, big ugly black and blue bruises. I figured it was time to give up the bed frame and rid myself of the bruises. I dismantled the bed frame and moved it to the attic, then set the extra mattress up in another frame to complete the twin set in the guest room. I began sleeping on the trundle which had no frame, just a set of steel rods on wheels. I pushed my mattress at night away from the wall so I couldn’t kick it. The bruises still showed up. Not only that, but they had showed up in places I couldn’t have hit myself. I’ve never been a really flexible person, so large soft-ball sized bruises on my back worried me. It looked as if I had been an abuse victim. My mother, who is a nurse, took my blood because she was starting to be concerned about my health, and the lab said I was perfectly normal.

 Shortly after my back and neck bruises appeared, the man moved more rapidly than I had experienced before. He soon appeared standing next to my bed, leaning over to stare at me. I was becoming afraid of him; I knew that the bruises hadn’t come from anything else. At this point, I could no longer make out his face. It seemed like a dark void. During the day I even felt vulnerable. Walking home, things scared me much more than usual. I didn’t like to be alone, though I felt suffocated in crowds. I took my lunch at school in the hallway with a few people because being in the cafeteria made me want to vomit. During weekends I refused to go inside except to sleep, but at the same time I grew an intense fear of trees. I know it sounds crazy, but it was almost if the trees would harm me in some way, like as if they were a rabid animal. When I was inside, I would lose time. Sometimes I would wake up on the couch watching tv. Other times I felt like that time was spent in an all-to-real dream of being chased in the woods, or being lynched by a mob. Other than the sporadic black outs, I couldn’t sleep. He was there, always watching. 

This happened consistently for about two or three weeks until I couldn’t take it anymore. During the day, I stood in the doorway to my room and asked him to leave. Again, right before sunset, I went into my room, asked him to please leave, and apologized that I couldn’t help him. I poured salt on my windowsill, on the threshold to my closet, and then the threshold to my room. After that, I never saw him again. With time, my bruises cleared up and I began sleeping somewhat regularly. I became a lot happier and calm about being in groups and standing under trees. I’ve had plenty of encounters with ghosts before that and also after, but nothing as real as what I had when the man was in my room.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_k7y9p,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/k7y9p/the_man_in_my_room_kinda_longish/,
1375796007.0,24,self.Thetruthishere,1jt609,[ME][FAM] A Visit from Aunt Caroline,rockm-sockm,28,4,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1jt609/mefam_a_visit_from_aunt_caroline/,"I should not have to even type this in this forum but here it is anyway:  What I am about to post is 100% true.

I've been lurking in this forum for a while but haven't posted yet because  most of my stories are pretty personal.  Also, I have sort of a love/hate relationship with the paranormal.  I find it fascinating, but also a little unsettling.  People in my family (myself included) seem to be sensitive to things of this nature.  I've had several experiences over the course of my life, but I tend to shut myself to most of them.  Frankly, they freak me out.  The exceptions have been those involving family members who have passed - those are fine and are actually quite comforting.

This encounter happened when I was very young, so it was told to me by my mother who was also involved in it.  When I was first born, my (Great) Aunt Caroline would come to visit my mother often.  She had never married and didn't have children of her own, so she loved coming over to hold me, coo at me, etc.   She was a big fan of baby-me by all accounts.  Aunt Caroline was a very chatty older lady with long, jet black hair.  (My dad's side doesn't go grey much.)  She had a habit of talking so fast and so much that she would run out of breath. When this happened she would pause, inhale, and exhale deeply before continuing.

Aunt Caroline became sick a few years after I was born.  During one of her visits, she brought my mother 2 sets of priest's vestments and asked my mom to do her a favor.  Upon Aunt Caroline's death, my mom was to sew/embroider her name into each set of vestments.  One was to be donated to the local parish, and one to the Vatican in Rome.    At that time (and maybe still, I don't know) when a priest would prepare for Mass using a set of vestments with a name in it, he would offer a small prayer for the soul of the donor as he prepared for Mass.

Now, let me just say that my mom was the absolute wrong person to ask for this favor because she is a terrible seamstress/embroiderer.  But she agreed to do it anyway.  After Aunt Caroline died, my mom heard that one of her friends was going to vacation in Rome, so she quickly prepared the first set of vestments to send over with the friend.  It was, naturally, a big pain for her because of her horrible sewing skills, but she got it done so as not to miss out on the delivery potential.  The other set of vestments remained in the closet. And after a short time, she forgot about them.

Not long after that, my mother was having trouble sleeping.  Not normal trouble - she would wake up in the dead of night and feel anxious and disturbed.  She had trouble getting back to sleep afterward.  She had no idea why - just that she was waking up every night and unable to sleep after waking.

One morning, she was telling my dad about her horrible sleep interruptions and they were discussing what might be causing it.  Two or three year old me (not really sure how old I was) piped up, ""It's the lady who wakes you up, mommy.""  Then the following exchange happened:

""The lady?  What lady?""

""The lady!  She comes in through my window.""  

""What does she look like?""

""She has long black hair and a long white dress.  I can see the moon through her.""

""What does she do?""

""She plays with me and gives me a kiss.  Then she sits on your bed and whispers in your ear.""  (At the time, we lived in a small apartment.  My room was really just a small alcove off the main bedroom and if I looked around the corner, I could see my parents' bed.)

Naturally, my mom is freaked out by this.  Every morning, she asks me, ""Did the lady come last night?""  And every day I tell her pretty much the same story.   As she goes about her day, she's wondering who this person is and why she's visiting us.  She consults a priest, friends, etc.  My mom THINKS it might be Aunt Caroline, but she can't imagine why she's not at peace.

Then one day while all this is going on, my mom is in the kitchen thinking about Aunt Caroline and why she's visiting.  As she does so, she hears and feels a deep inhale/exhale on the back of her neck.  Immediately it dawns on my mom why Aunt Caroline is back:  the forgotten vestments in the closet.  So, she gets up, takes them out, performs her mediocre sewing to the best of her ability, and delivers the vestments to the local priest.

That night, my mom sleeps soundly for the first time in weeks.  The next morning at breakfast she asks me again, ""Did the lady visit you last night?""

""No,"" I answer a little sadly.  ""She didn't come.""

And she never came again.  Why would she?  She got what she wanted.  As cool as this story is, the thing I love about it is the fact that Aunt Caroline obviously had a need and a goal, but she took a second to say ""hi"" to her great-nephew - me.  I just think that's awesome.

God bless you, Aunt Caroline.  Rest in peace.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1jt609,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1jt609/mefam_a_visit_from_aunt_caroline/,

This annoyed me because it meant that the slightest delay meant I missed the last train home and had to get cab. One weekend I was delayed by a system fault in work and had to get a cab home. Furious at the unnecessary expense I called a cab firm.

The drive home was about 5 or 6 miles and involved driving along the old Dock Road. This was the old main road which followed the line of miles of docks and all the entrances to the docks led off it.

After a few miles the driver had to slow down. There was an accident and police and ambulances had brought traffic almost to a standstill. Naturally curious I looked  at the crash site. There were ambulance crews working on a man in distinctive motorcycle leathers. They were bright red and white. Standing looking over them as they worked was a man in identical leathers to the motorcyclist who had crashed. There was no sign of another bike, so, I assumed he must have been the passenger on the bike. Eventually the traffic began to move and we drove on.

The next day reading the local paper I saw an article about a motorcyclist who had been killed travelling home from the city centre; alone !

I was surprised but assumed that it must have been a different accident. As I read further details I felt the hair on the back of my neck tingle. It was very obvious that the paper was describing the very same accident I had witnessed the aftermath of. The driver was a motorcycle dispatch rider who was speeding after having been for a drink with friends after work. Was that his spirit or 'Daemon' that I saw standing over his dying body ? I guess I'll never know. It certainly gave this non-believer food for thought though. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1gwt42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gwt42/the_biker/,

this first story il write i have written before on a thread on askreddit however it was posted long time after the thread started. so i want to share with you guys.

when i was younger around 6-8 years old i was at my Summer cabin at a place called Hvaler, Norway. the Island i live on is its paranormal activity. people have seen ghost, UFO, and Huldra (Mythological) tho the sightseeing is with some Cows and a lady, with cow tail walking down a place thats been since placed street lights

i was at a big family party where Cousins and distant will gather, play games, Drink and having a good time. i started to grow tired and asked to go home. (the party was at another place and it was 1 Km or less away) my aunt offered me to drive me to her place since none of my parents wanted to go home just yet since she didn't drink any that day. so i accepted it and went with her. 

I went to sleep only to be awoken by a dark figure shined by the Moon lights walking past the bed edge, it didn't spoke nor look at me. however it had a night robe old fashioned. i was not scared and shrugged it off but to this day i can picture the event.
I found out later that it might be my Great Grandmother who died before i was born, because she lived there before my aunt and Uncle.

Event 2: short one... My dad bought an Old Summer house at Tvedestrand, Norway. where most of the furniture and children toys was left of previous owners.  at this event i was 18. My dad and my Brother left for picking up groceries with the boat and i was all alone in the house. I heard a furniture moving upstairs the kind of moving a couch. not a screech but rumbling sound. it freaked me out a little but i went up and saw nothing unusual, but the sound was clear. they came back later but of course none of them was inside the house when i heard it.

TLDR: saw a Ghost at edge of bed passing by and heard something unkown moving furniture upstairs.

Or it's on my profile, either one.  It was years and years before I could talk about the night I saw my father.  And when I could, it was to the only person I was ever able to talk to about my father:  his sister, my aunt.  To explain her encounter with my father requires a bit of back story.  Stay with me on this.

Now, my aunt and her two kids lived with my grandmother for years and years.  Even now, after my grandmother is gone, my aunt and one cousin still live in her house.  My grandmother built that house, and it is set into a hill.  The back side is literally underground, and the front overlooks a huge depression between the hills, ""The Holler,"" as my grandmother used to call it.  The front is mostly large windows, and with very little front wall to block the light.  In the living room, the door is set all the way to the left of the room (facing out) so the rest is covered with windows.  Before my dad died, I was constantly over at my grandmother's house with my little brother and my cousins.  Whenever we went over there we would wait outside.  My dad would knock ""Shave and a Haircut"" and pop his head around to the window to look in and let them know who it was at the door.  After all, they were two women living all alone out in the country.

But as I said, it was years after he died before I could talk about the encounter with his spirit.  When I could talk, it was to my aunt.  I was living with her and my cousins and my grandmother at the time, around eight years or so after losing my father and seeing him later.  I told her about it.  I told her about how my mom had acted like it was nothing, that I had been dreaming.  She got really quiet and then she told me this story:

Around the same time I had seen my father, she had seen him as well.  She had been sitting in the living room all by herself one night after everyone else was asleep.  And she had heard a knock on the door--it was ""Shave and a Haircut,"" my dad's knock.  And she had looked up out of instinct to see who was at the door--to see my dad popped over to the side like he always did to let her know it was him.  Only he hadn't been an amorphous figure, like when he visited us.  It was him, as clear as day.  He wasn't spooky or ghostly at all.  He lifted his hand to wave at her, and he was gone.  She has only told me this story once, and she generally won't talk about it.  She was the closest to him of anyone in our family and I believe that is why he appeared to her in such a strong shape.  She was fully awake at the time, I might add, unlike when I saw him.  She believes--and so do I--that he had come to tell her goodbye for the last time.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1cu997,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1cu997/famfollow_up_to_the_night_my_dad_told_my_mom/,

Perfectly normal. I've had odd things happen before, but nothing recently, and nothing as odd as yesterday. Which I've told her about. In her personal opinion (though she's nonreligious) the supernatural/paranormal is an actuality, as she's seen too many sane people experience things in her 30 years of work to simply write it off as nonsense. I've been seeing her for about 9 months now, and were I to be suffering with something, she'd have noticed by now. She's been in her line of work for a hell of a long time and after a while I'm sure it gets easy to spot the true crazies.""*

I've had an exceedingly paranormally active day, it seemed every corner I turned something would happen. I'd think I was crazy, but I wasn't the only one to witness the happenings. 

First things first, this morning I was alone in the house doing my makeup before school. Not one other person in the building, no music on, nothing. Utter dead silence, when suddenly I hear tiny whispers from a few feet away. The voices become more distinct, and I recognize them to be female. They giggle and talk for a while, and I try my best to ignore it. I was late, and didn't have time to deal with it.

Driving to school I was panicked because I had about 8 minutes to do a 15 minute journey. However, when I actually got there, only 6 minutes had passed. Speed limits had been kept to, and I hadn't misread the clock, due to my double checking in disbelief of how late I really was. (This ones more /r/Glitch but oh well.)

Everything was normal and dull at school, nothing else happened until three hours after I'd arrived, at about 11. We had a free day, and were allowed to do whatever as long as there was complete silence. The teacher's not one to let someone off without a detention, so everyone was abiding by the rule. Suddenly, I heard the whispering again. Closer this time. I looked around, no one was talking, no one had moved. The same voices, it sounded like. Giggling and talking. 

About ten minutes after this, I heard someone say quite clearly and in a normal tone: ""The next one should be easier."" 

I jumped at the disruption of the quiet, and looked too see who had spoken. Not one person in the room had reacted, no one was being written up. The phrase started repeating in my head. Over and over and over. The only thing I can think of is either I'm going insane (I seriously hope not) or someone thought that, or some sort of entity said it. It made no sense to my thought pattern of the time. 

Later on I was returning from lunch, and the cafeteria is across a courtyard from the main building. The buildings are modern, and the doors are heavy and metal. They're the kind where you have to push a bar to open them. The wind was blowing heavily, and I was expecting to struggle with the door, considering that the winds direction should have been blowing it shut. No sooner had a laid a hand on the bar that the door swung open, gently. I walked through, and it closed just as gently behind me, rather than being slammed closed by the wind. A guy I don't know was standing in the courtyard staring at me, and asked: ""How'd you do that?""
I just shrugged, and kept walking, but was inwardly freaked out. 
(These doors are not, have never been, nor will they ever be automatic in any shape or form.)

Lastly, I spend the evening at my boyfriends house. I walked from his room into the living room, and could have sworn I saw an older woman sitting on the sofa. Looking directly at me. She felt/looked grumpy with my presence. She gave off the feeling of being someones mother/grandmother. I was freaked out, and turned the light on. Still the outline of her form and the feeling she gave lingered. I was freaked out, and told my boyfriend. He said I'd described his fathers mother, who I hadn't known. Nor had I known she was passed. 

For the remainder of the evening both my boyfriend and I continued to see orbs and lights in his room, darting about. 

So, that was my freaky day. Pardon for any spelling mistakes, and my laziness when it came to the story telling, etc. I'm exhausted. Thanks for reading!",,False,,t5_2sntx,1366334134.0,,,True,t3_1cl6et,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1cl6et/today_has_been_full_of_odd_occurrences/,

I dated her for a good two years and was over at her house pretty often. The house was rad, spacious yet cozy and all that, except for the hallway just outside of her room, the game room, and the backyard. Those three places always felt a little off to me. But she hated the whole house. 

She said she got depressing vibes all over that place, and sometimes they'd turn into a deep feeling of terror out of nowhere, according to her. I guess she'd gotten used to it, but after she let me in on her ""vibes"" deal she began to be more open about it with me. These are some of the things I remember. 

So she's in her room, home alone for the day. TV's off, she's drawing at her desk. She then claimed she felt a strong THUD against her wall, strong enough that it knocked over and shattered a champagne glass from her parents' wedding off the shelf on the wall. She stopped and stood still, listening to see if it was someone breaking into the house. The thud happened again. She locked her room and phoned her parents and they were apparently still out for the day. 

Another thing happened while I was actually there. We were in her room watching television, home alone again. I hear the printer in the room across from hers go off and start printing a bunch of papers. She had told me about it before, and we went to see what it printed. It was just nonsense everywhere on every page, but even that was kind of unnerving considering the fucking printer was off the whole time (at least as far as I saw). 

She had told me a bunch of little stories of things that had happened over the years, things like waking up in the middle of the night and feeling like something just outside her door was watching her, seeing a shadow man walking in the hallway on multiple occasions, and hearing her voice being called. From my perspective, I just always felt the slightest unease in certain portions of her house, but nothing really noticeable. 

She eventually did research into the house's past, and found that the previous owner had to get rid of the house because of some personal and legal issues that apparently included domestic violence and abuse, IIRC. One thing she made sure to tell me was that the family was Hindu and then she went off on a tangent about ""worshipping false gods"" leading to supernatural problems and ""meddling with things you shouldn't be"" which I found really offensive and close-minded. She was uber-Christian, so maybe she interpreted a lot of those things from a particularly defensive perspective, but anyway, I just wanted to share some of that stuff.

Also, my very first time submitting, yay!

Midsummer's eve, about ten years ago. Me and my ex-SO were planning on spending a romantic weekend at his mother's childhood home, which was now serving as a summer cottage. The cottage was located in a tiny island, and in order to reach it you had to first leave your car by the road (it was really remote, so this could be done), then walk about 2 km through the woods and finally row a boat across a small river.

When we reached the cottage, we found the key to the front door was missing. I was already feeling like there was something out of place, but decided I was probably just a bit tired from the journey. My then-SO was really long and skinny, so he managed to wiggle his way in through a small window and open the door from inside. We then proceeded to unpack our stuff and got a fire going to warm up the sauna (a must on Midsummer around here). My ex told me we were going to sleep in the first room on the left, the old master bedroom, and I went in to make the bed ready for us. As I entered I was at once hit by a strong feeling of dread: we were not welcome here. I tried to shake it off, because I didn't want to ruin our weekend, and so said nothing about this to my ex.

We decided to have a bite to eat before going to the sauna, and as we were eating I noticed my ex start to look a bit pale. When I asked him if he was okay he told me he was feeling really ill all of a sudden, and there was a chill running through him constantly. I put my hand on his forehead; he was clearly running a high fever. He was feeling just fine before, so we were both a bit puzzled by this sudden illness. We thought it would be best for him to rest for a while, so we went into the bedroom to lie down. I wasn't thrilled about going in there, but it was the only place with a bed at that time so we really had no choice.

I remember very vividly what happened next. We were lying on the bed; my ex with his eyes closed and breathing heavily, sickly warmth pouring from him like crazy, and me very much awake and alert. It began as a cold feeling of dread, just like before, but this time it kept escalating to the point of pure fear. My heart was pounding faster and faster as I realized we were in the middle of nowhere, we had no phone, and my ex was the only one of us who could even drive. Then I saw it in the doorway.

A shadowy figure, clearly male, was standing on the doorstep. It was leaning toward us, radiating hate. It seemed reluctant to step all the way in, but made sure I knew if it chose to do so, it could. There was no other way out of the room except though the window, but that was sealed shut. I mustered all of my strength, shook my ex by the shoulder and explained to him that we had to leave NOW. He was still very weak, but I managed to get him up and packing. The figure was nowhere to be seen; it had vanished when I focused on getting my ex to his feet.

So, we packed in a hurry and left. I told my ex I had felt and seen something strange, but mainly I explained our haste with the fact that he was ill, and we needed to get back to civilization while he was still able to travel. But what do you know: by the time we had crossed the river he was feeling a lot better, and his fever was all gone before we reached the car. He mentioned something about maybe going back now that he was okay, but I quickly refused.

We drove back to his parents' house, where there was a small Midsummer family gathering taking place. People asked why we returned so soon, but I didn't say anything to anyone about what had happened; only that we came back because my ex was feeling ill. We had a couple of drinks, chatted with his relatives, everything seemed back to normal. So much so that I was starting to doubt myself; had I really even seen something? I must have been overreacting, imagining things. Then my ex's uncle speaks up: ""By the way, did you know the place is haunted?"" I felt my stomach curling up with fear, as if I had swallowed an ice cold stone. He continued: ""Yeah, it really is! I remember my dad telling me about it. He said that even before he was born there were strange things happening down there all the time, according to his own father. Then one day a weird old man appeared to the door and said he was there to help. He then proceeded to draw lines across the yard with some kind of metal wire while chanting silently to himself. When the guy was finished, he said he had re-conducted the energy flows around the property so that the house would from now on be left untouched by evil, then went on his way. I remembered all this when my brother said he had done some landscaping at the cottage, and removed a bunch of old wire that was running on the grounds. I wonder if the ghost is back now! I heard he really liked to frequent the master bedroom, isn't that where you guys were sleeping?"" He laughed heartily at his last comment, I just sat there feeling sick to my core. I didn't dare to ask more details about this claimed entity, why it was thought to be there or what it had previously done to make itself known, but could not stop wondering what would've happened if we hadn't left when we did.

Never went back to the cottage. Never saw of felt anything like that again.

I have 2 sisters, the other is already married and 42 years old and has 3 children, the other one is 38.
One day I visited my ""younger"" sister and we talked about dead people contacing their loved ones. Then she told me a lot of things which happened to my oldest sister. Unfortunately she lost her Child, his name was Sven, he had a heart problem because his heart was not fully grown as it should. Then he had an operation on his heart, before the operation he was playing, he was happy and worried about nothing. At that moment no one would have thought that he would left us forever.  There were complications and so he bled to death...

It was her second child, she loved him so much and after his death she really became depressed for a while.
That was now the background story.

After his death a few things happened to her. She and her husband made a CD with all the favorite songs of her son. They knew that there was one song missing, but they have forgotten the name of it. Anyway, once in their car they started the CD to listen to the songs, to think about the old times, maybe laughing about the good times with their child. Then after the CD was over, they turned the radio on and they were really surprised because exactly at that moment they've played that song who was still missing on the CD. Maybe it was a message or just coincidence. 

Well then there was another story. My sister became pregnant and bore a new son. When he was 1,5 year old he played, maybe you know those letter things, which a child can play with to learn spelling, well he was playing with them for a while and then my sister came into the room and was shoked when she read the name of her dead child on the bottom. She could not explain that happening to herself, because she never really told his name to her newborn so he could not know his name anyway. 

Since that day, my sister believes that her dead child wants to show her, that he is still there. Perhaps all of these things are just coincidence, but those happenings helped her a lot through her depression. And I think that is really the most important.

Sorry if there are a lot of mistakes but I'm still trying to improve my english :)

---------------------------------------

Back in September of 2008 my best friend Ciera (pronounced Sierra) and I went to a park named Hocking Hills in the American state of Ohio for a day retreat from our busy lives. We had decided on this at random when we first got together early in the morning just after sunrise; it was a nice warm late summer day and we'd just got the wild notion to go for a drive to Hocking Hills since the area is well known for its several walking trails, a cave or two, and several waterfalls and running water / creek areas. The day was very warm maybe roughly 70 degrees Fahrenheit  / 21 degrees Celsius so we had worn shorts and short sleeved T-shirts. 

We started down a trail at random and found that part of the trail had been washed out so we had to take another path which according to our phone’s GPS tool would force us to cross a small country road.  As we played with our mobile phones and noted it was roughly 12:00noon EST we happened to be passed by a group of backpackers before we reached the road and one of the people turned around to warn us to be aware of a wash out up ahead if we were going to take the trail into the woods, they recommended we follow the one next to the fire tower instead as it by-passed a small clump of downed brush.

As we crossed the road to the tower trail we noticed there was caution tape all over the fire tower, there was a pungent smell in the air which we could not identify, the windows on top of the tower appeared to be taped up, grimy, and there were flies all over the area. We walked past it, commenting how odd it was, and continued down the trail we had been recommend to take, but it was one neither of us had noticed before on a previous walk to the area. This trail took us past the fire tower and then cut into the woodlands; as we walked into the forest maybe 1500 feet / 457 meters or so we took notice that no one seemed to be around and in fact not only did we feel isolated from others but we felt very chilled without explanation. Ciera pointed it out verbally while I was thinking it, but we just continued walking. Eventually the air started to get noticeably chillier and damper. This did not seem unusual at first but as we continued to walk the air seemed to go from warm to what felt like the mid-50’s Fahrenheit   / 10’s  Celsius  and we started to shiver.

It was also getting darker as we continued forward; at first I thought it was just due to the green leaves on the trees and maybe a passing cloud over head but the darkness really did not improve as one expected.  As we walked we looked around and there were nothing but trees on all sides, there should have been a forest edge somewhere as the area wasn't really that big but aside from some hills and tall pine trees there wasn't a real 'ending' to the woods like we expected as the area tends to be narrow and normally you can see the edges. My friend took out her phone to use her GPS because she instinctively felt lost but her battery was nearly gone, I took mine out of my back pocket and it had no signal, the battery was also near dead, and showed ""EE:EE"" for the time (meaning it couldn't update as it was an older style flip-phone with camera and when set to auto-adjust would contact the mobile phone network every 15 min).

It was only then as the light grew dimmer that I noticed the area seemed very silent, our footsteps, the leaves we stepped on, grass, twigs, and our breathing just echoed. Ciera got spooked and I did too, she mentioned it was very out of the ordinary and I agreed but I couldn't shake this sense of foreboding that something was amiss. I tried to rationalize it but I really, honestly, couldn't figure any of it out at all.

We just pressed onwards and after going down a small hill and back up it seemed to have gotten a lot darker. The world seemed to have gone from just shadowy to near twilight darkness. My friend grabbed my arm and started freaking out about how weird it got - then the air seemed to have gone still and we had a feeling of something wrong. We both took off running looking for an exit, for some odd reason we never thought to turn around at all and just got back the way we came. It never seemed to occur to us as we ran but the spookiness continued as we could hear our steps echo off the area as things just felt like they grew more gloomy.

Then ahead of us down another small dip in the trail we could see two large honeysuckle bushes on either side of the trail like a gate. We made a mad dash for these bushes and just as we pushed through the plants something odd happened - we were over whelmed by a change in our surroundings as light, sound, and warmth returned all at once. It was like stepping outside of a cold, empty, and dark building to a warm busy street. We stood at the edge of a place known as Ash Cave which has a large water fall not too far away with a u-shaped cliff. I turned around to look back from where we emerged and while the bushes were the same the area was so different, brighter, not silent for sure, and warm. In fact our skin was cold to touch which just reinforced the facts. We took out our phones and the time had finally updated, it was now 4pm. The normal trail would only have taken an hour to walk fully so it was a loss of three full hours!

Logic attempted to set in and we decided the trail we came up must have just appeared creepy because there may have been clouds over head or a storm blew by but when we went back between the bushes there was no trail. Nothing looked like it had a few seconds ago. Ciera walked around the bushes twice and it was the same bright sunny day with no darkness and no trail. We waited, it was blue sky over head and we could see the edges of the forest and other people. The trail had simply vanished as it we had never walked it.

On returning to the normal trail with the wash out we ended up locating an off shoot path which took us back past the fire tower. It was here we noticed it was normal looking  as the windows were not taped and very clean, and  there was no pungent smell. We don't know what it was, but it certainly was creepy. Of course I jokingly told her later that day over dinner we had entered the faerie realms by mistake and were lucky to get away, she didn't find that funny of course but either way we both felt we should share this with you and if anyone out there has had a similar experience perhaps they can provide insight or share their own.

I've only just been made aware of the existence of this sub-reddit, so I wanted to hear some other peoples opinions and see if anyone else has had a similar experience. Before you read and draw your own conclusions, I just want you to know that I do attribute this all to PTSD and combat stress. That being said, none of this is fabricated or embellished, if it were...I would probably have made it more interesting...with ninjas....and a pirate....and some more explosions....So, without further adieu...

I've been in the Army for just over 7 years now. During this time I have spent just over 2 1/2..2 3/4 years in Iraq doing various missions, mostly combat oriented, as I was in the artillery and when there was no artillery mission assigned to us we just assumed the role of infantry. Anyway, all this started back during my first deployment. My family has a long, proud, history of military service. There has been someone from my family serving in every major, and minor, conflict the United States (and the colonies) have been in as well as conflicts spanning back to Europe before we came over here. I had always heard stories of the demons soldiers bring back from war (figuratively of course, not ACTUAL demons) and part of me attributes this to my PTSD. My first major engagement occurred back in early 2006. We had been in country for several months at this point. During this time Iraq was a much more violent place than it is now. In fact it's argued that it was more violent then, than it was at any other point during the insurgency. It was night time, I would say around midnight, we began taking fire from some houses located in a palm grove. During the course returning fire, I demolished one of the, what I am only assuming was, a house. Since that night I have had this feeling of a presence near me, always out of vision...or in the corner of my eye but never quite there. Sometimes I dream of it...a man...in a black robe like the kind men wear in the middle east, I forget what they're called and it isn't really important. When I dream I can make out the figure to obviously be a man in such a garment. However they never do more than stand in the corner of a room. When I'm not sleeping I will always see them, like I said, out of the corner of my eyesight, or at times in the corner of a room.
My girlfriend has always been a perceptive person. When we first started dating she was climbing into my truck one day, around midnight I think, with me and said that there was a man sitting behind me. She said he looked all burnt up and he kept, not so much saying as projecting, that he was sorry for something. When I was in that engagement the building I had blew up, so this struck me as some sort of connection, maybe this burnt man was the same one I had seen in my dreams and in the corners of my vision. I don't know...and honestly I don't know why I'm sharing it.

1351709938.0,23,self.Thetruthishere,12evl4,It's about time I share everything I can really think of that's happened to [ME] and or others I know. [FAM] [FR],MarkytheCrusty,29,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/12evl4/its_about_time_i_share_everything_i_can_really/,"Alright guys this is going to be a very long winded post, but hey who doesn't come here to read? Alright I'm gonna share quite a few different things that have happened to me in my few years of living also a few stories of my family, and a few close friends.

 Alright so I guess I'll start at the one that was the most meaningful to me. Back in 2011 I was living in Oklahoma at time (I have moved around a lot and so will these stories.) and I had gotten a call from an old friend back in Indiana telling me that my ex whom I was really close to had passed away while getting a blood clot removed. It was a really hard for me as I had been living in Oklahoma with no friends or family so it was a pretty bad time for me and suffering from severe depression from a lot of things at the time this didn't help at all. Well I want to say that night I was sitting in my bed crying my eyes out and just listening to music when the song Over and Out from Alkaline trio comes on and if any of you aren't familiar with the song the first lines says ""Over and out, she said from a hospital bed for what it's worth it doesn't hurt, don't cry."" You could chalk this up to coincidence, hell I would have too but she was a huge Alkaline Trio fan and she made me fall in love with that band again after I had forgotten about them. Our song was even an Alkaline Trio song so I felt it was her way of saying goodbye to me. She had suffered from mental issues and always talked about how living made her suffer I felt like it was her saying that she's all better now as well. I had another encounter with her energy as well almost a year ago. She came to me in a dream and said she's sorry she didn't say goodbye, but then again that could have just been me. 

Alright let's jump into stories from my childhood. I wanna say when I was about five or six we lived in a apartment in Indiana and I remember every night when I'd try to fall asleep I would here then legos in my tub moving around like someone stick their had in the tub and spun their hand around. Also I use to have a long shadow person watch over me while I slept whenever I ran into my parents bedroom to sleep. After much thought I feel like it could have been my mom's father who always wanted a grand kid but sadly passed away before he had one. It's just a theory all I know is it use to scare me shitless when I was younger. I also use to suffer from sleep paralysis when I was younger as well. I can still remember the dream vividly I had a hag and everything. Alright this next one isn't too paranormal but it freaked me out nonetheless.

 I was living in Saginaw, Michigan about a year ago and it was about three in the morning I had just started falling asleep to what I can only describe to as the feel and sound of a moving car like if you were on a long car trip and that sound of the tires on the road and the feeling of moving and then I start feeling like I was floating I shook myself awake needless to say I was freaked. 

Alright now stories of my family the only one I can really think of is the one involving my great grandmother Mimi. I wasn't there when it happened sadly, but she had passed away I want to say at the start of 2002 and after the funeral and everything my family was sitting inside of here trailer when the back door swung open and then closed. No one ever went out that door, so they took it as her coming back home. Also every time we have a family get together at the clubhouse of her old trailer park we'll get pictures of orbs. I have a picture of one sitting on my shoulder.

 Alright now time for the last stretch my friends. I have about three short stories. The first one involves my friend since grade school who lives in a old train stop dating back to the late 1800's. He says he's seen someone walking down his hallway and he hears doors slam every so often I have yet to experience any of it and I don't think I will because his city is sadly bulldozing his house to make it a parking lot.
 Now this one is about an old friend who use to take the trail through the graveyard to school everyday and he use to tell me he would see a green ball of light fly over a few graves ever morning and one time he saw what he described as a cloud hanging over a tombstone.

 Now for the final one that I did get to experience. Back in Michigan I had a neighbor who owned a house that was about one hundred years old. (The whole block was like that honestly, my old house was built in 1916.) I would come over to hang out and they had a apartment to the house upstairs that no one lived in and no one would go into because it freaked them out. Well one day they had thought someone had broken into their house and being on the not so great side of town I decided to come over and check it out for them. While looking throughout the main floor and the basement we heard footsteps upstairs so we did the stupid thing, and went to check it out because knowing the cops they wouldn't come regardless, so we went to the side of the house where the door was and it was locked so I unlocked it and went through clearing and checking all the rooms, not a damn thing in there. Supposedly they also saw a little girl in the upstairs apartment and the kitchen light turning on.
 There I'm done. Sorry for this wall of text and the time of your life you won't get back. I sadly have a few more stories but I need to talk to my lady about them before I share them.

I was sleeping on the couch in the lounge room when i was awoken by someone softly calling my name. I opened my eyes and saw the faded out image of a beautiful woman sitting in my grandmother's chair, wearing a checkered apron and holding a tray of cookies on her lap. She smiled sweetly at me and just sat for a few seconds looking at me. By this time i was incredibly frightened, but too scared to move. Without warning she vanished and images of my grandparents flashed all over the room, the final image of my grandmother smiling settled on the television. I got up and ran to my grandparent's bedroom, screaming and crying. 

A few days later I was getting ready for school. I went to my grandmother and gave her a hug. ""See you after school, I love you"", she said. My dad picked me up late from school that day. My grandmother had died whilst I was at school. A week or so after her funeral I was at my dad's house ( My mother was still grieving) and I was looking at an old family photo. Tears stung my eyes as i saw a very familiar face, the woman that had visited me. She was my dad's cousin who had cared for me when I was a young baby. She had been murdered a few years after my birth. My dad looked at me, smiling from the memory. ""She loved you so much, she was always looking out for you and making sure you didn't get hurt"". 

To this day I believe she was trying to let me know ahead of time, in an attempt to protect me from a very hurtful situation. I believe that she will return to me the next time a family member is going to die.

I was in a choir, and our practices were held weekly in an old church. One night I had to use the bathroom in the middle of practice and because I did not use it during our break. The bathroom was located a floor beneath the practice area, in the basement of the church. It is important to note that there are no windows located in the basement and there is no way that any sort of draft could get in there. I went down and opened the door and found that the lights were off which in itself was weird because the lights were ALWAYS on. I got a sort of uneasy feeling when I turned them on but brushed it off quickly. I went to the first stall and tried to open it. It was locked. I found this really strange because the only way these doors can lock are from the inside and seeing as many people used this bathroom during break I found it weird that it was locked. I tried opening it again, even slamming my body against it. Nothing. So a little weirded out I went over to the next stall. Exact same thing. Again I slammed into it and failed to open it. Eventually I gave up and shrugged it off and moved to the last stall which was open. After I was done I was just about to unlock my stall when I heard the distinct sound of the lock sliding from one of the other stalls. I froze for a minute hoping that someone had come in while I was using the bathroom or that I was hearing things. I opened my stall and saw no one and both of the doors to the two other stalls still closed. I felt really uneasy and started washing my hands. I was looking in the mirrors and in the reflection to my horror the door to stall number one (which had been locked) was opening. I'm not talking about a slight push from a breeze (0f which there was none) or the bounce a door does after you open/close it. This was full on opening so I could see the entire inside of the stall. I just stood there not knowing what to do. Then the door started to close just as slowly. By this time I did not want to stick around to see what happened and I ran back upstairs and continued practice with my choir. 

Even thinking back on this still gives me shivers. To make it creepier, the basement was a nursery so the bathroom was filled with kids toys which kind of made me feel weird as well.

1343099606.0,23,self.Thetruthishere,x1xsg,[FR] Choose Your Friends Wisely,DecimateTheWeak,28,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/x1xsg/fr_choose_your_friends_wisely/,"(Back story) - I started working a job and at every start of a shift we drew cards to see what station we’ll be working at, and who we’ll be partnered with. I drew my card and got pair with someone I’ve never worked with before we’ll call her Amber. We worked for awhile, a few months, together and once I get comfortable with someone I like to throw out random questions. So I decided to ask her if she believed in Angels and Demons. (It’s one of my go to questions when I get to know someone because I believe and I’m fascinated with it.) We were working at a steady pace, but when I asked my question she straight up froze in her spot. She slowly looked at me and asked me why I would ask that. I told her I was just curious if you believe in it or not. She leaves and comes back about 10 min later visibly distraught. Feeling terrible I apologize to her and told her to forget about it. She tells me its fine and asks if I still want to know. I say only if you’re comfortable answering it. She proceeds to tell me about her unique experience with a group of so called “friends” and what she thinks was a demon.

(Her account) – Amber at this point is just happily married and life is going extremely well. Her brother has been trying to invite her to come over and hang out with his new friends but she’s been reluctant since she’s been told they’re not the best people to hang out with. Finally she caves and goes over to chill. She has a good time with everyone and starts to hang out with them more often. The more she goes over the more excited her new friends get. One person in particular, we’ll call him Gary, and his sister, we’ll go with Jenny, takes a personal interest in Amber. They start playing card games, but Amber tells me that only Gary was allowed to deal the deck, and the cards was a normal deck of cards but with markings on them that have been drawn on with a marker. Markings she’s never seen but didn’t really get concerned about it. She said she never understood any of the games they played, but they were drinking having a good time and wasn’t to worried about it. Then Gary asked for her necklace and took the cross off it and replaced it with a trinket of some kind and said it was his gift to her. Eventually Gary and Jenny had Amber reading from a book to help them study for a class they were taking about a mythology (at least that’s what they told her) and it was easier for them to grasp the concept if she read these passages to them while they took notes. 

Soon after that Amber’s life takes a huge slide downward. Her marriage starts to crumble she becomes mean and spiteful towards her husband to the point on physical violence, but every time these outbursts happen she says doesn’t recall a thing, that there is a space in time that is just lost to her completely. She starts hearing and seeing random things from the corner of her eye but can never look fast enough to actually see what’s moving. Things with her family deteriorate her mother comes over to visit and doesn’t see her daughter anymore but a bitter person full of rage. She starts using drugs later on and loses her job (the drugs came after her seeing and hearing things she claims, I made sure to ask that while she was telling me this). She stops going over to hang with Gary and Jenny as requested by her husband. Eventually her husband leaves saying they need some time apart. A week or so later Gary calls frantic saying that he’s sorry and the he has opened a door and it needs to close it. Amber, pissed off at the world, doesn’t respond to the messages. Then Gary shows up at her door pleading her to just take a 10 minute drive he’ll explain everything and that’s he desperately needs to undo what he did. Amber finally gives in and agrees because she’s curious what he has to say.

Apparently, if you couldn’t tell already, Gary and his sister play with the occult and have been setting Amber up the whole time, from the card games to reading from the “text book” as an experiment. They were too big of cowards to do it to themselves so they targeted someone they didn’t really know. They invited something into her and it decided to stay. The whole car ride Gary is apologizing and saying he didn’t know that it was going to be this serious. He said that he must close the “door” and hopefully they could undo the damage done. She argues with him and refuses then she starts seeing the figures while they’re driving dodging across the windshield. She pulls the car over and starts yelling at Gary even more when Gary starts mumbling something then grabs her leg and digs his fingers into her thigh. Amber got instantly quite and she said that when Gary grabbed her leg he let out the most guttural yet highest pitched scream she’s ever heard come from a human being. She says it was the most frightening sound she’s ever heard, and couldn’t believe that a human was even able to emit such a sound. Things got eerily quite and she said Gary looked physically exhausted, like he just got done running a marathon. Gary looked at her and said that it was done and she should be safe.

Things did get better her husband at the time was still upset and reluctant to go back but they were technically still married and were trying to work it out (unsure of what happen later we all got laid off from our jobs and I never really got to see her again.) Her family noticed an immediate difference in her attitude and she went to a rehab for the drugs and she found a job, which was how I met her. She says Gary and Jenny still try to get a hold of her but she has never once thought of picking up their phone calls.

I do try to debunk it because I try to be logical, but since it didn’t happen to me I will never really know. It could because of drug use but she swears up and down that this was during a dry spell because she had no money for drugs and her demeanor while telling the story was intense. Either way, if it really did happen or if it was all in her head it was still an interesting story. 

(TL;DR – co-worker/friend hangs out with some new friends and gets possessed.)

My mom and dad split when I was young and she got remarried.  My stepdad had two sons, one around my age, one a few years older than me.  We all moved into this decent 2-story house that sat at the corner of a busy main street.  I lived there for 8 years, and that was 8 years of hell for me.

My mom and stepdad would fight all the time (6 out of 7 days a week, for 8 years straight), and it didn't help they were alcoholics.  They never seemed to experience anything paranormal, but me and my sister (and maybe a few others in my family that stayed over there for any amount of time) definitely witnessed things.

One thing stood out in my mind... I was fairly young, maybe 10 years old or so, and I had woken up from a nightmare.  I bolted straight up in bed.  My mom was knelt down at the foot of the bed shaking my left foot; ""Hey [my name], are you okay?  Are you okay?""  I said, ""Hello?"" repeatedly, and she would keep asking if I was okay, not responding to my hello's.  It was her, in the flesh, shaking my left foot.  I was confused why she wasn't responding.

Suddenly she disappeared and in her place stood this enormous shadow person.  The door to the hallway was open and there was always light coming from the staircase, but this... thing had mass to it -- I couldn't see through it.  I sat there and just stared at it, and I was frozen in fear.  It eventually dissolved (didn't move, but dissolved), and I sat there for a while longer trying to process what happened.  I promptly laid right back down and fell asleep.

My sister who had lived with us for a short period of time had walked by my bedroom one day and saw a large black figure standing by my window.  She did a double-take, but the second take it was gone.

I used to sleep under my covers every single night, terrified of poking my head out because I could just feel this figure standing next to my bed staring at me.  I felt safe under the covers.

The room next to me had the entrance to the attic via a door that doubled as a closet.  Those who stayed in there would often hear pounding on the door, movement in the attic, pounding on the walls, and various weird things happening to their electronics.

I was terrified of going upstairs by myself in the daytime.  I always saw people out of the corner of my eye, always heard people talking that were never there, always strongly felt presences of things that I couldn't see.  I was a little kid and this scared the crap out of me.

Aside from a disconcerting voice in the back shadows of my subconscious, I try to pretend that I imagined the events that transpired last summer. After all, I was suffering from severe depression, and it was another few months before I finally sought treatment. I want to be convinced that the depression, a new environment, homesickness, and added stress all combined to warp my fragile mental state into one of mild psychosis. I want to be convinced that what happened was strange - nothing more nor less than odd and a little unsettling. I can't be convinced of that. No matter how many people refuse to believe me, I am unable to stop believing myself.
I spent last summer at a music festival. I won't say which one, but I will say that it is in a very old and very beautiful area of the U.S. The first few days I was there were blissful. Although I missed my family and my boyfriend of six months, I was content to play some beautiful music with new, talented colleagues. On top of the high musical standards of the festival, I was lucky enough to meet some of the warmest people I've ever encountered.
At the end of each day, I crept back up the stairs to my third-story room. It was swelteringly hot - so much so that my roommates would constantly remove their clothing and pressure me to join them in their sisterhood of nudity. If this seems like a moment out of a bad porno to you, rest assured that it felt like it too. I resented the fact that I couldn't have friends come into my room for fear that my roommates would be naked.
I wasn't close with my roommates, but I knew them well enough to be worried when one of them went to the hospital. Apparently, Breanna had been taken to the hospital after seizing. I was worried and a little surprised. We had discussed our various medical ailments after they saw me taking some acid reflux pills, and Breanna had never mentioned that she was epileptic. I texted her to wish her well, and carried on with my day.
I was interrupted, however, when my other roommate found me. I wasn't used to seeing Christa with clothes on, nor was I used to seeing her so upset, so I was completely taken aback when this ashen version of my roommate approached me at dinner and told me we needed to talk.
""I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm not staying in that room by myself anymore,"" she told me.
""What are you talking about? Do you think Breanna is crazy or something?""
""What? No, of course not. Don't you know what happened?""
""Well, yeah,"" I responded awkwardly. ""She had a seizure. It happens. What's so bad about that?""
Her eyes grew wide, but instead of looking more shaken, she looked even more exhausted. ""That's not the whole story.""
Apparently, Breanna had been using the rest room in the practice building when she started screaming. A loud, piercing scream rang through the building until a guy named Chris could open the door enough to peek through. What he saw was irrational, but so was everything else that summer.
Now, doctors insist that Breanna had a seizure, even though their tests showed that her body was perfectly healthy afterwards, save for a few cuts and bruises. Most people at the camp knew only that; but since we were her roommates, Chris took Christa aside and told her the truth, with instructions to pass it on to me.
When he looked through the door, he didn't see a seizing girl. He saw a girl being violently thrown around the otherwise empty bathroom. It looked like she was trying to escape some entity, but whatever it was kept trying to grab onto her. Eventually, in an almost inhuman display of strength, she grabbed the toilet out of the ground, threw it, and then passed out.
I want to think he was pulling our legs. I really do, especially since Breanna nervously told us later that night that ""it was a seizure, ok? just let it go!"" before going to bed, fully clothed.
But the bathroom was closed the next few days for repair, and it had a brand new toilet cemented in the ground next time I used it.
I'm trying to put these experiences out of my mind, but writing them is cathartic, if exhausting, so I will continue to post more later.

It occured in the same wooded location as the encounter with [Creepy Chick](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/qyx09/creepy_chick_xpost_from_rnosleep/).  I originally posted it on Obiwan's UFO-Free Paranormal Page, and it was subsequently published in Barbara Smith's Ontario Ghost Stoies, and has an entry on the Toronto Ghost and Hauntings Research Society's website.  There are a few details I left out of the original story that I will include here.  I also wish to state that I am an avid hunter and spend countless hours in the woods.  I am well aware what coyotes, wolves, moose, deer, bobcats and black bears sound like, and this was nothing like any of them.

Back when I was in high school, there was a wooded area north of us nicknamed ""Salem's Lot"" that was widely believed to be haunted.  I have no idea where these stories originated from, but they ranged from whispers about KKK murders to the unburied dead wandering about after dark.  One of the most common stories involved a pioneer-era graveyard that was moved from the site to another gaveyard north of the woods.  This allegedly disturbed the spirits of those buried there and resulted in the area being cursed.  We often partied there during high school and never had a single paranormal experience there until on night in the summer of 1993.

I had just got my first car and was driving around with my friend ""Spam"".  After getting bored of driving aimlessly with nothing to do, Spam suggested we drive up to the 'Lot.  Having not been there for a couple years, I agreed and set off to find the old gravel road that led into the woods.  Arriving at the area where the old gravel road led into the woods, we found it... gone.  Literally as if it had never existed.  I assumed we came to the wrong area and set off to try and locate it.  We turned north on Salem Road and eventually came to the ""new"" graveyard that the pioneer graves were allegedly moved to.  We parked the car and started exploring the gaveyard.  

After a while, we were walking back to my car when suddenly Spam told me to ""keep six"".  To anyone who doesn't know, ""keep six"" is slang that means ""I am about to do something sketchy, so make sure nobody is around to catch [us].""  At the time, we were approximately 20 yards from the car, and the graveyard sloped down away from us.  I could clearly see down Salem's Road both to the north and the south where we drove up from.  I glanced both ways and turned to see what the hell Spam was up to.  I looked down and Spam had a tire iron and was attempting to pry up a footstone from the gave e stopped in front of.  I just had enough time to process what he was doing and let out a ""what the fuck are you doing?"" before we heard a voice behind us as ""Can I help you boys with something?""

I spun around to see an old man that looked in his 70's standing not 10 feet from us, and saw the man's pickup truck was parked my car.  I was quite unnerved as I could not understand how this seemingly frail old man could have drove up silently, parked his truck and walked the 50 feet to us in the 20 or so seconds since Spam said ""keep six"".  Unnerved, I stammered out a ""no man, we're just looking around"" as Spam tried to covertly stuff the tire iron into his pants.  Nervously, I asked if he was the caretaker of the graveyard.

The man replied, ""no, I just sit on the board"" and looked at us like he knew we were up to no good.  We quickly muttered that we were leaving and walked back to the car.  The old guy followed, got in his truck and drove south down Salem Road.  

""WTF did that mean?"" asked Spam.  Neither of us had a clue what ""board"" the old guy could be a part of, and we were unnerved by how he suddenly appeared out of nowhere and his strange reply.  I put the car in gear and headed south down Salem Road, following the path the old guy took.  We drove until we almost reached the railway bridge at the southernmost part of the road when suddenly we saw the old guy.  He had parked his truck in the middle of the road at the threshold to the bridge, and was leaning against the tailgate, facing us, with a stern look and his arms crossed.  I slammed on the brakes and sat there watching him watch us for a minute before putting the car in reverse and driving back the way we came.

We pondered the creepiness of the old guy as we drove the long way around back to where the entrance to the 'Lot used to be.  I parked the car over where I was sure the gravel road used to be and got out.  Spam grabbed a bag out of the back of the car that had a knife and a dime-store copy of the Simon Necronomicon in it.  We started off into the woods walking between two rows of cedar trees that skirted a farmer's field on our left.  Eventually, the path we were following turned right between two trees that had odd symbols painted on them (likely from kids).  We continued following the path until the woods opened up to a corfield on our left, and the path we were following intersected another path to our right that led through the woods and across the old mill we used to party at back in high school.  However, I couldn't understand how the road that we used to drive in on had quite literally disappeared in the two or three years since the last time I was there.

Suddenly Spam got another bright idea that was apparently inspired by the arcane symbols we saw painted on the trees on the way in.  Pulling out the Necronomicon, he suggested we carve a symbol from the book into the ground ""to scare anyone coming here"".  I shrugged as he chose a demonic symbol from the book (the symbol of Pazuzu, IIRC) and started etching it out on ground with the knife.  Suddenly, he called me over to see something.

Two or three inches in the ground, he had found something hard.  We dug into it with the knife and pulled up asphalt.  We wondered why anyone would pour asphalt into the ground and cover it with dirt in the middle of the woods, unless they were trying to hide something.  We both started digging using our hands and the knife.  Work was slow going, but as the sun set we had quite a hole dug.  At that point, we lit two fires on either side of the hole so we could better see what we were doing.  However as the sun set, we were having a hard time seeing anything.  I have no idea what possessed us so badly to dig that hole, but I suddenly stopped and suggested going home to get a shovel and a flashlight.  Spam agreed and we started throwing dirt from the hole on the fires we had lit so we could see.

Suddenly as the last bit of fire was extinguished, I heard what sounded like a dog barking on the far side of the cornfield.  The dog barked louder and sounded like a bunch of dogs barking, then a few more until it sounded like a 100 slavering hounds barking and snarling.  The sound was getting louder and louder as it came across the cornfield at us.  Within seconds, it went from soundling like it was a half-mile away to sounding like it was 50 feet away and closing fast.  The barking/snarling had another quality about it like what a loose fanbelt sounds like in winter, but more of a squealing like something being torn to pieces that refused to die.  By now this hellish racket was louder than any concert I have ever attended (and yes, I saw the Ramones live when they were together).  Terrified, I turned to Spam and screamed ""what the fuck is that?"", but I was unable to hear my own voice over the deafening cacophony.  Spam looked at me with a face as white as a ghost, turned and fled back down the path the way we came.

The next thing I remember was being in the pitch black, halfway back to the car and holding a large stick in my hand like a club.  The hellish noise had been replaced by an unholy silence.  Not a cricket nor any other creature could be heard in the summer night.  We hastily made our way back to the car, where my hands were shaking so bad I couldn't get my key in the lock.  Opening the door, I unlocked Spam's door, started the car and flipped the headlight switch.  Nothing happened.  For whatever reason, the headlights simply didn't work.  I put the car in drive and floored it out of there anyways.  After we got about 50 yards down the road, the headlights came on by themselves.  I drove for about 20 minutes, pulled the car over and asked Spam ""what the hell just happened?""

We never did find out what came after us that night, and truth be told, I never really want to.  That night changed my perception of what is real and make-believe in this world, and shook the very foundation of my belief system. You can choose to disbelieve my account, but I know what I experienced in the 'Lot that night and it was not some junkyard dog or random coyote pack.

Absolutly freaked I ran right down stairs  where I seen my brother sitting on the computer and looking at me like an Idiot. All of it took place in a matter of a 30 seconds. The vent to my room is in the basment. My brother wouldnt have had time to do all that. It was an absolutly amazing experience, and for as much as I like the paranormal, it is sadly the only one I've had in my life.

First, let me begin by saying I have had a lot of paranormal experiences in my life. I would also like to begin by saying I had a very “unconventional” childhood. Most would call it ridiculously fucked up. So, please forgive me if I do not go into a lot of detail or answer questions about it. However, I often wonder if my childhood left me more “open” to certain things. A conversation better left for another time…

The most frightening experience I ever had was when I was around 12 years old (I think) and my step-father and I were travelling through a very remote area of Montana. I will not name the town, but I will say it was on the eastern edge of Glacier National Park. The town itself was very sparse. There were only a handful of buildings. What I thought was curious was a very large cabin-like building at the “head” of the town. It reminded me of a rich person’s hunting lodge or a ski resort.
Anyway, it was getting late and we had been driving all day, so my step-father decided to stop for the night. The only place open was a seedy little motel, the one-story kind with all the rooms in a row connected to one another. There was only one other car in the parking lot, the one next to our room.

I remember there not being anyplace to eat, so we had to make do with the snacks we had in the car. I ate on my bed, dividing my attention between watching the crappy television (this happened before there was such a thing as cable) and reading the horrifying Night of the Grizzlies (again, we were just outside of Glacier where that story takes place). We eventually turned in early.

I have suffered from insomnia pretty much my whole life, and this night was no exception. I remember lying in bed and going through the nightly routine of relaxation techniques, counting sheep, etc. Around 3:00 a.m. I heard sounds outside the bathroom window. The tiny bathroom was right next to my bed and it had one of those small rectangular frosted glass windows high up on the wall. The sounds were what my mind characterized as footsteps. Two sets of them. They stopped outside the bathroom window and I proceeded to hear low whispers. I could not make out what the words were. Then, I hear these low moaning sounds. These started out quietly, but rose in both volume and ferocity. After about three minutes, they were so loud, I was looking over at my step-father’s bed wondering why he was not waking up. Suddenly, the moans changed into snarling and growling. I lay in my bed, petrified, trying to rationalize what I was hearing. Then I heard blood curdling screams coming from the next room. These noises were actually coming through the wall next to my head. There was some tearing sounds, thumping, and after maybe five to ten minutes the noises just stopped. I didn’t hear anything else for the rest of the night and you can be assured I did not fall asleep.
The next morning, I subtly inquired if my step-father heard anything. Again, I am used to strange things happening and not being believed by others. He had not. We went to breakfast in the big lodge-like building; much to my surprise it was the town restaurant. When we walked in, it was one of those television moments where everyone literally stops and stares at you. I was very creeped out. We ordered scones and coffee. I remember it being my first scone and it was delicious. However, my step-father finally caught the vibe from the locals and we noped the fuck out of there as soon as our order came.

I told this story to a friend a few years ago after he mentioned that exact same town in conversation. He had lived in another town about 30 miles away. He told me the town was kind of like a joke to locals in that area because everyone found it very creepy and just “off.” He told me the town was made-up of all one family and they had all emigrated from Eastern Europe. I do not know what happened and I do not know what it means.

That night as I was going to sleep (I coincidentally have the bed she slept on before going into assisted living) my hands felt numb, and then it felt like someone was holding my hands and sitting on the edge of the bed like she used to... 

The next day, and the days following, until the viewing/memorial service everything was pretty normal. The night of the viewing I had the same feeling of someone holding my hand the entire time we were there. Afterwards my family on my mother's side all went to my aunt's house. As I was walking up the steps the rocking chair on the porch started rocking. There was no wind whatsoever, nor was there any animals on the porch. When I got onto the porch, it stopped. Later describing this phenomena to my mom, she said ""strange... The same thing happened at the funeral home"". My uncle had witnessed both occurrences so I know I didn't just imagine it.

We must've moved upwards of 10 times before I turned 16.

None of the places we lived were terribly memorable, except one. 

We rented a house in a decent neighborhood, I think I was around 12-13 at the time. (I'm 20 presently.) 

Anyways, after everyone (Mother, younger sister, myself) had went to bed, I heard a sound coming from the bathroom outside my room.

I got up and looked, and sure enough, the door was closed, and the light was on. 

Assuming someone was using it, as it was the only one in the house, I went back to my bed.

The next night, the same thing happened, but as I was standing at the threshold to my room, I heard a male voice come from inside the bathroom. 

It was muttering, I think, but I heard one word clearly, ""Leave.""

I ran to my mother's room, and woke her. She looked to the bathroom, and saw nothing.

I wouldn't sleep in my room after that, I slept in my mom's floor.

Two weeks later, I was awakened to the same voice. I looked down the hall, and saw the light in the bathroom again, but the door was open this time.

There was a completely inhuman screech sound, and the door slammed shut, and so did the door to the room I was in.

My mom woke and heard it, and so did my sister. 

We moved the next day.

I still can't explain what happened there, Reddit.

Honestly, I think this story may not be as scary as others I have seen on this subreddit, but I have never found an explanation and although not particularly exciting it has been my ""creepy campfire story"" that I sometimes tell others. This is true.

I used to do a lot of hiking and mountain biking near my house before I went to college. It is mountainous, desert terrain. I had a couple friends that I would sometimes go with, and this day I was with one of them. We rode out mountain bikes as far up the trail as we could, and then hid them and continued on foot, as our goal was a small canyon we had seen with binoculars. Now, we RARELY see other people up there and we would go a lot, so we knew the terrain very well and kind of had a feeling for the area. We continued on and entered the mouth of the canyon, and at this point the foot trail ended and we had to climb over rocks and kind of figure out our own trail. It was not that hard and I have made the same trip many times since. We hiked for about 30 minutes until the canyon abruptly ended in a V, with sheer rock walls on either side. We decided to take a breather and drink some water and look around. It was about 5:30pm so that left about another 45 minutes, give or take, until the sun started to set. We were about to leave when I noticed the remnants of a fire ring, with charred sticks inside a circle of rocks. We were wondering who would come up here to make a fire when I saw next to the ring a very odd object. It was a small doll, or figurine, made out of grass tied together. It reminded me of the ""Blair Witch Project"". we weren't scared at the time I assume because it was daytime and we were armed but in retrospect I find it creepy. The doll's grass was green, while there was not any live grass around in the immediate area. Also, it was very windy up there, the wind would come in the canyon and become very violent at the V. The doll had not been blown away. These two facts make me wonder how recent to our hike the doll had been placed there, and where the ""person"" who had made it went...

I have never seen any more dolls up there, but the fire circle remains. My friend had picked the doll up and only put it down after I noticed and told him to drop it, he realizing how dumb it was to pick up a random creepy doll. Don't worry, nothing happened to him, but to this day I have never found out where that came from (I don't know how I would've), nor have I seen another one or any people up in that canyon. I will say that high rock walls on either side of you will give you the feeling of being watched...

Sometimes I think maybe I just made it all up, but there were other witnesses, and my father was there as well.

This Catholic Church had a K-8th grade school attached, where I had previously attended, and where my mom had worked. The janitors told my mom about footsteps in the corridors in the k-2nd grade wing, and voices that they attributed to the old monseigneur, who had died some years previously. My mom ran the computer lab in this building, and while we were in the room the lights would turn off. My mom would tell the class that the lights were broken, but we both knew that the switches were actually flicking off. I heard somewhere that power surges can make a switch flick on its own, does anyone know if this is true?

Anyway, I was in boy scouts there and we did a canned food and clothes drive. It got late before the stuff could be taken to LA mission and there was no where to store so much stuff so it was left out in the open-air cafeteria and me, my dad, another adult, my best friend, and another kid stayed the night in my dads tent trailer to protect the stuff.

Beside the potentially paranormal part, it was an unnerving night. We kept watch and did patrols of the campus with flashlights every hour or so. At midnight two cars pulled up to each other in the parking lot and presumably had some sort of drug deal. Even creepier, at 2 in the morning a young girl rode through the parking lot on a bike.

On one of these patrols I looked through the window on the entrance door of the k-2nd grade building and in through the classroom door window of the kindergarten class ([like so](http://i.imgur.com/Nk766.png)) to see [this](http://www.google.com/imgres?start=75&amp;num=10&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS379US379&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=713&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=f7zwSl2CcISj8M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.cakitches.com/books/anatomy-dummy.html&amp;docid=QzYvGugJ3kJbZM&amp;itg=1&amp;imgurl=http://www.fotosearch.com/bthumb/ESP/ESP005/0628-200977-01.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=170&amp;ei=-oX0TvH1IeGYiAKpzYzJDg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=263&amp;sig=103950982935379469201&amp;sqi=2&amp;page=5&amp;tbnh=136&amp;tbnw=104&amp;ndsp=19&amp;ved=1t:429,r:8,s:75&amp;tx=79&amp;ty=56) sitting on the table, just like that picture.The dummy was facing us perfectly through the two diagonal windows. It was creepy, so I made my friend look. Upon returning from our patrol we looked through the windows once more to find that the dummy had moved. The dummy had turned 45 degrees or so, so that it was now difficult to see it's exposed organs. I told my dad and the other guy and they just kind of dismissed it, as they didn't see it previously. Of course, all of these doors and buildings are completely locked. About an hour later we checked the dummy through the window again and now it was on a completely different table and very difficult to see from our original and only viewpoint. This time even my dad admitted that it had moved. It didn't move again, and we never heard or saw anything else unusual for the rest of the night.

This is a difficult ghost story to tell because of the strange angles and frankly just because it is so *weird.* It doesn't sound cool to tell to people, and it just doesn't make sense. Why would a ghost move a dummy like that? Even if someone was in there, why move the dummy so slightly over the course of 2 hours? I guess what I am saying is that  this story is 100% true. I've been ghost hunting in this section of the school at night and I always feel a mad desire to keep my eyes on that corridor, but nothing ever happens.

Really, almost never.  On November 17th, I had a powerful dream before waking up abruptly.  I was on my motorcycle, and the dream was in first person point of view.  Usually, my dreams will be in third person (at least those I remember) and they're in fact, almost never in first person.

I was looking down at my motorcycle, at the speedometer and the handlebars, and I was watching myself go over it, as if I was flying.  This was after avoiding a car off to my left.  As I soared over the bars, I woke up.  This was something else.  It struck me, enough to mention the dream to my little brother.  I was shocked that I remembered the dream and that it impacted me and stuck with me, but that's how it was.

So I went to work and whatnot.  That same evening, at around 6:30 I decided to leave for school.  My mother (she has premonition dreams, usually regarding people she knows dying) inexplicably pleaded for me to not take the motorcycle that day.  She begged me to let my father drive me in the car.

I told her she was being irrational.  It wasn't raining or anything, nor was it cold enough for ice to form.  I continuously dismissed her nervousness and her requests.

I hopped on the bike, and turned right on the light by my house.  2 blocks down, I see a car pull up to the stop sign from my left.  I'm visibly riding in the middle of my lane, with my headlights on, and illuminated by street lights.  Not speeding.

As I'm reaching the intersection, I see the car suddenly drive into the intersection, completely oblivious of my presence.  He gets into my lane, I swerve out wide to avoid making contact, and suddenly...it happens.

It almost happened in slow motion, I avoided the contact, and in the process, my tires locked up causing my bike to fling me forward.  I see the same exact things I saw in my dream/vision.  I watched the speedometer and handlebars slip downwards as I get launched forward.  I was completely at peace during the whole thing, never panicking or fearing.

Next thing I know, I flip in the air so that my back is facing the street, and my face, chest, stomache, and knees are facing the sky.  I watch the leafless tops of the trees slide into my field of view, directly in front of me.  Suddenly, I come down with a crash, my head thumped (thankfully I had a full face helmet), my right elbow took a hard impact (but I was wearing an armored jacket which literally saved me).  My knuckles and fingers would have been skinless if it wasn't for my carbon-fiber reinforced gloves.

It happened exactly as it had in my dream, and my mother was feeling something bad about to happen that same day.  I made no mention about the dream to her, so it's not like she had that in mind.  In fact, she had no idea.  It wasn't until my little brother mentioned later ""Oh, it was just like in your dream,"" that I realized it.  Good thing I mentioned my dream to him earlier that day, or I would have missed out on this insight.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_n9782,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/n9782/foreseeing_my_motorcycle_accident/,

After reading some of the amazing stories here in TTIH I felt I could share my experience, and possibly get some feedback and/or insight from you all.
.
My small family recently moved into a new apartment three months ago, and at first everything seemed fine (*minus the minor bug infestation*) and we were happy to be here.
.
After the first few weeks by 2 year old daughter would refuse to stay in her room at night, she would say she is scared of the dark and there is monsters outside her window. We would shrug these off and make her go to bed because we thought she was just adjusting to the move and getting used to her new space.
.
A few days ago I asked my husband to take my daughter out and surprise her when she got home with new decorations. As soon as I was in the room alone I started feeling eerie, like something was watching me from the hallway (*maybe this explains why she will sleep if the hall light is on?*) I also heard little pitter patter footsteps multiple times. Needless to say I was just a tad bit paranoid at the end of my stay. As I was gathering up my supplies I went to go get my soda (was a hot soda, straight out of the pantry...unopened) that I had left on top of her dresser and it slid a few inches away from my hand.
.
I reached for it again, and now I cannot stop thinking about leaving my daughter in there at night. Could her fears be irrational and they just got to me? Or could there really be something going on?

I'm a fan of detail and I've never made my own topic on reddit before, and unfortunately I am not a writer!

I hope this is the right place to post this, and I apologize if it's not. :( This literally happened an hour and a half ago. It's not anything exciting unfortunately, and it may be a crappy first post, but it's my first experience that I can think of that I legitimately thought was supernatural.

Anyway, a little back-story to lead up to it. I'm a member of the Pride of the Southland in Tennessee, and if anyone around here knows, we get up pretty early on Saturdays. Well around 1am I remembered that I had forgotten my music folder for the stands. As one of the people in the band that's a music ed. major and HAS to be in it for three years, that's a very bad thing. I'm currently staying at a friend's apartment on campus, so I decided soon after that I need to take a trip to my apartment about 20 minutes away. Once I got there, that's when it got weird.

To give you an idea, my parking spot at the complex is a good 10 second walk from my front door, which leads up to a second story one bedroom apartment that I share with my girlfriend. I parked in my spot and when I got out, I immediately felt this feeling of unnatural fear...something I've never felt before. I felt like I was being watched from all directions at the same time if that makes any sense. I've never been one to be afraid of the dark, but this was horrible. I basically ran to my door, unlocked it, turned on the lights, then immediately shut and locked the door.

I felt really uneasy until I got past the second step, which I'll come back to later, and walked up to the living room. The living room has a balcony overlooking the sidewalk and I swear I could feel something watching me through that balcony. It's at that point that I got my tiny little music folder that I made this whole trip for, and got the hell out of there. As soon as I opened the door, of course, that horrible feeling of fear came right back until I got in my car and got out of there.

I immediately called my girlfriend who, having history with the Chippewa Indian tribe, told me that she had also felt these feelings sometimes at night when she can't sleep and had apparently burned sage all through the apartment and salted the second step (as I mentioned earlier) and in front of the door leading to the balcony.

I guess the advice portion of this is...what should I do? Moreso, what did I feel? Was it bad vibes from a malicious ghost or was it just my imagination? Either way, it freaked me out. I'm back at my friend's apartment right now typing this up and I can still feel that really deep fear, like the world is going to end...

Any help on that, or response in general would be appreciated. Or if you liked or disliked the personal experience part, that's cool too.

It was around mid-late October after dark. I was leaving on my bike from a friends house who lived about a quarter of a mile away from my house. My friend and I were talking about scary movies and in the spirit of halloween I decided to ""challenge"" satan (grew up LDS so Satan and hell were reality as far as I knew at the time) to give me a good scare on my ride home. Pretty retarded thing to do I admit, but I was young and not familiar with some of the more terrifying paranormal activities that other people have experienced. I didn't really understand or appreciate the potential of what I was asking for.

So on my ride home, after playfully vocalizing my challenge, the first thing that happens is a couple street lights go out completely darkening the area ahead. No big deal, other lights down the road where on. It was in all likelyhood a coincidence. Down the street a little more a car backs out of a drive way really fast, stopping just a few feet short of me. A little disconcerting, but eh, probably more of a coincidence than anything. The rest of the ride home is uneventful.

When I arrive home I drag my bike through the garage toward the back yard to park it. This area is dark at night. The house's backyard is pretty big and the fence at the end is a chainlink fence behind which is an alley where our dumpster were. As I park my bike I say, vocally, something like this in response to the mediocre scares I perceived to be ""offered"" in response to my challenge:

""Come on Satan. That wasn't very scary. You should do something like make a big wolf appear in the alleyway or something.""

Not more than a few seconds after I say this, a big fucking wolf casually walks into view in the alley on the otherside of the chain link fence, stops, and stares straight at me. I just sort of stand still, looking back at it, trying to ignore the creeping panic inside me. I turn around and walk into the back door of my house. The back door lead through a short hall that acted as the laundry room which connected to the kitchen. In the kitchen was a window facing out to the backyard. When I look through the window I no longer saw the wolf. Just gone. 

Keep in mind, this was in Phoenix Arizona. To my knowledge, wolves are not in any way likely to be seen. Coyotes maybe, but I've seen coyotes, and that creature was definitely not a coyote. It was way too big and the colors were all wrong. It was most definitely a wolf.

Since then I've respected the supernatural, or maybe feared it? Either way, nothing else has happened, and I hope to keep it that way.

The ones that most don't really believe. And that's cool, just don't judge me :D.

One night, I was sick and home alone with the kids. It was an overall crappy day and I was running a bit of a fever around 104 or so, laying on the couch watching TV. I was tired but FAR to sore to get to sleep. When I get sick, I run fevers ALOT and know they are ultimately for the better *so long as I don't break 104.5 because from there I usually shoot right to 106, and that's when it can be dangerous. 

Now, we lived in a trailer at the time. The front door opened into the living room to the right, and the kitchen to the immediate left. From there there was a hallway from the kitchen to the bathroom and kids room. My children were (to my knowledge) playing in their room. Things got quiet and I figured they were either asleep or just watching TV quietly. Either way, they weren't breaking things or fighting and I was great-full for that :D.

At about 3am I had finally JUST fell asleep when I was jolted awake by my daughter. She shook my arm to wake me up. For some reason, I didn't even get the slightest bit angry. Normally this would have pissed me right off tho, I wouldn't have yelled at her as it's not her fault I was sick :D. 

Anyway, she told me she was awake because she was ""so very thirsty she can't stand it"". This was my *then* four year old daughter telling me this. So, I got up and walked in the kitchen, got her a large glass of cold water. She downed the whole thing very quickly, which at the time didn't strike a cord, but now I think about it....... I couldn't even have drank it that fast. As if she just poured it out, however the floor wasn't wet or anything.

So, after her drink I put my hand on her shoulder and walked her back to her room. The hall was dimly lit by the kitchen light being on and some light spilled into the kid's room. We got to the door frame, and immediately to the left was her bed and in the corner opposite the door was my sons bed. The TV was on, but blue screen and dimmed. So, I had enough light to be able to see my son, sleeping all contorted on his bed *per usual* and my daughter SOUND asleep in her bed as well. 

My entire body went numb as ........ my ""daughter"" was standing right next to me as I stood in the doorway. I looked from my real daughter sleeping in bed to the child next to me, who still looked like my daughter. She took three steps into the room, turned and smiled while waving and slowly disappearing. . . . . . 

I was honestly numb with fear, but cautiously angry at the fact that there was something in my children's room that may or may not be dangerous or hostile. My protective instinct was stronger then my fear and I walked right to the spot the child disappeared in. There was no tingly feeling *other then what was left from my initial shock* and no cold feeling. 

I've experienced quite a few paranormal things threw-out my life and have a fairly good understanding of what to do to deal with most things. 

Honestly, to this day I'm not sure if I was hallucinating due to the fever *which, normally I don't hallucinate until hitting 105 or higher* or it really was something paranormal. Either way, the image of my *alter* daughter smiling, waiving and slowly disappearing from my sight still haunts me to this day, badly.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_ixexy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ixexy/was_i_hallucinating_im_still_not_sure_to_this_day/,

I have numerous stories to tell but the absolute most oddest one of them all is the one I'm about to tell. Now, I'm no writer, I'm also not that great of a formatter, so bear with me. I'd love to hear anyones explanation or insight or if something similar happened to them.


My family lives/lived in a super small town outside of Athens, GA our whole lives. A place called Comer with a 3 mile radius city limit and population of about 5000. Word travels, but that's about it. Back in the early 80's my step dad was the chief of police of the town, and his sister and mother worked a local sewing plant that employed about 400 people. My dad typically worked 3rd shift as he had a good reputation and would often give rides to the town drunks home instead of to jail. Since he worked 3rd, When my aunt and gran would get off work, they go home fix dinner and bring it to him later in the evening, typically around 10pm. 


Late one Summer evening, they meet my dad at the local Texaco station to bring him dinner. They drop it off and head back home. Now the stretch of highway on their way back home is a lonely10 miles of curving back roads and pastures with sporadic Georgia pines thrown in. About halfway home they roll the windows down to listen to crickets and such on the drive as it was a peaceful clear evening. My gran notices a flicker of light in front of them and my aunt acknowledges that she sees it too and begins to slow down. 


As they begin slowing, the flicker of light lifts out of sight. The car engine then stalls and cuts off. My aunt tries restarting the car, then suddenly a light overshadows the car. As my gran begins to look outside the window they notice a brilliant ball of white light slowly lower in front of the car. About 5 to 6 foot across and glowing. My gran asks my aunt ""what is that?"" and turns to her and notices my aunt in an entranced gaze with her mouth open. The light stays there for a brief moment then lifts out of sight. The entire time, my aunt seemingly hypnotized by it. My gran, at this point panicking, tries shaking my aunt, who suddenly snaps out of it and screams. They regain their composure, crank the car and continue the drive home. 


When my step dad gets home that morning they describe their experience and chalk it up to ""wtf"" and ""no idea"", but then over the next two months my aunt starts acting funny. Company would be over or having casual conversation with family and out of nowhere my aunt would fall in a trance like state. When people would start talking, she would say what they would say, when they were saying it. Almost like knowing in advance what they were gonna say. This happened about 15 different times with numerous people encountering it. When my aunt would snap out of it she would break down. It seemingly was driving her mad. My family called several psychologists and even neurologists to check her and couldnt find anything ""wrong"" with her. She was a perfectly normal 30 year old woman. 


Then late one evening about 3 months after the incident my step dad was working and decided to pull into the city park, which was notorious for teens parking and drunks sleeping. There he decided to eat his dinner. He got out of his car to stretch his legs for a moment and looked above the treeline to notice a ball of light very similar to the one that my gran and aunt described, hovering just above the trees about 50 foot in front of him. He unsnaps his holster and places his hand on gun. 


They stay there about 2 minutes. No movement, no sound. Then suddenly the light glows brightly and shoots straight up into the sky until it's out of sight. That night was the last night that my aunt had her ""problem"". 

Sorry for the length but that's one of my stories. 

TL;DR: My aunt and gran saw weird light, two months of jibba jabba, step dad has an old west showdown. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,1376488859.0,,,True,t3_1kchsw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1kchsw/fam_the_light/,

I am a bit of a skeptic and am not sure what I believe concerning these stories, but I am going to start posting them here.

My mom was a school teacher in Hawaii in the mid-80s. The first few stories were told to her by her students. Hawaii is a very active place for supernatural activity due to the high levels of pagan and satanic worship that still take place there. One of her female students came to her very upset. This was one of her best students who was not prone to making things up or seeking attention. This girl told my mother that her grandmother had walked the aisle at her sister's wedding. This was not unusual as the grandmother traditionally escorts the bride in Hawaiian weddings. What was unusual was that the grandmother had been dead for several years. According to the girl, the grandmother had appeared at the foot of the aisle, walked slowly to the altar at the front of the auditorium, and then vanished.

Thoughts? Comments? This is my first post so I am interested what you think. I will be posting more of her stories in the days to come.

The relationship between him and my mother had been very strained in the past years, so it was the second or third time I saw him in about eight years.

The day after he died, my mother tried to call my dad at some point, who was out driving to a grocery store (I think). When she tried to call my dad, she only heard music on her cellphone. She let me listen to it too. It was definitely old music, about 40's or 50's, a bit reminiscent of Fallout music if anyone played those games. A woman was singing in English (I'm from Belgium) but it sounded a bit gritty as if being played from a record. Now, my grandfather was a youngster during the 50's (he was born in the late 20's) and I know his old record player was an object of importance to him. I didn't recognize the music and neither did my mom. I gave the phone back to her after listening for about 10 seconds, she hung up and tried to call my dad again, this time successfully. 

We've never had a similar problem with our cellphones before and we both saw on the cellphone's screen my dad's number was being called. What do you guys think?

At the time it was me, my older sister (by a year) my baby sister (she was 3) and my mother and father who both worked.

On weekend nights me and my older sister would sneak downstairs to watch USA UP! All Night with either Rhonda or Gilbert Godfrey as the host.

This one night, as me and my sister were sneaking down the stairs we heard it...a booming voice coming from the living room belonging to no one who lived there.

""WHAT'S UP TRIS?!!!"" My name...emanating from a dark room.

Me and my sister looked at each other then with muted screams ran back upstairs and I slept in her room that night because I was too scared to be alone in mine.

The next day I asked my father if Uncle Milton or anyone was staying downstairs ""yesterday"" and the answer was no. We knew he wasn't down there as my sister always did ""parent check"" before we sneaked down.

1370329550.0,22,self.Thetruthishere,1fmzry,[ME] [PIC] The Necklace.,sl33psatisfied,28,6,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1fmzry/me_pic_the_necklace/,"First off, I'm 20 now, and I don't live in the same house mentioned here, and yes, strange things have happened since this house but I'm pretty sure those things are unrelated. The only other stuff that's happened to me was minor compared to this, so I figured I'd share with you guys.

So, [I've drawn a map of the house](http://24.media.tumblr.com/0abad4566832aac8bedcfcfda33131d8/tumblr_mnuvh34x2Q1s8lgamo1_500.png), because I feel like things could get confusing if I didn't. The layout of the house always sort of struck me as strange - even though I really adored it. It was an older house we were renting I think from a friend of my dad and grandma. 

The first event that I think started all this stuff, was where I've drawn the yellow/red star. I was probably nine at this time, and my mom had just started leaving me home alone for 10-15 minutes while she ran to the store or something. I'd usually be there with my little sister who was 3 or 4 at this time. I don't remember ever being scared to be left alone, I was more excited. So one Saturday, it hadn't even been five minutes that my mom had been gone when I heard something in the front part of the hallway. I thought my mom had gotten home, so I ran around the corner where the front door is. (if you haven't figured it out the blue lines are doorways.) Only, I got there and my mom wasn't home. Then it hit me that she would have called my name if she had been home. I looked around for a bit, trying to figure out what the noise had been. Where the star is there was a coat rack and I thought that maybe a coat had fallen down, but they were all still there. However, on the ground there was a necklace.
[It looked like this, only older and it was missing a few of the gems.](http://www.snowbirdcottagedecor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Disco-Ball-Necklace.jpg)

Being a 9 year old girl who still played dress up and liked pretty things, I of course kept it and didn't think much of it. I know it hadn't been there before because my mom is pretty serious about housework. I would have noticed the necklace during one of my sweeps through the hallway.

When I was younger, I used to read a lot. I'd read one or two books a day, and I'd stay up late reading them. I slept with my light on before the stuff started, but they definitely didn't help. Given that I was already supposed to be asleep, I was already sort of on alert as I read my book, as my dad had taken books from me before when he caught me still up. Sometimes though I could hear them coming and hide the book under my pillow and pretend to be asleep. So when I heard what sounded like my sister crying for my mom one night (I live in the south so it was a younger child crying ""Mama!"") I didn't think much of it at all. Until my sister didn't cry out again, and I didn't hear my parents stirring. I can't remember exactly, but I think I might have even tiptoed down the hallway to her room to check on her. My parents had changed her regular door to a dutch door so they could leave the top part open but she couldn't roam around. My sister was still asleep though, and I figured I'd just imagined it.

Then I started seeing things. Not just at night either. I'd be playing solitaire on my bed and see out of the corner of my eye my sister come in the room but I'd look up and no one would be there. (See: the green x for where I'd commonly see the child.) There were many nights I'd be reading and I'd see a woman pass in front of my door and look up, thinking it was my mom, only to call out and my mom answer from the living room. 

I don't think they scared me. Then again, I did continuously sleep with my light on. I always imagined they were benevolent though. I know I saw and heard them more than a few times though.

The man, however, I only saw once. It was one afternoon and my mom (the big circle) was yelling at me (the little circle) about chores or something. 9 year old me of course would rather be reading or watching Toonami. I was only really half listening to her when I saw him. He walked across the front of the living room and he was wearing a business suit with a briefcase. I don't know why but my first thought was my dad. Which is silly because my dad doesn't own a business suit and certainly not a briefcase as he's an RN. Even so, I asked my mom when my dad would be getting home from work. She got angry at me for not paying attention and snapped that it'd be hours until he got home and why I was asking. I shrugged it off and told her that I was just wondering. 

I wore the necklace to school and such and explained the story to all my fellow schoolmates, the ghosts and everything. I'd asked around my family and no one had ever seen the necklace before, so I knew it had to have come from them somehow. Then the necklace broke. I was pretty upset about it but my dad promised to help me fix it as soon as he can, I just had to put it in a safe place. 

In the bathroom (B1) we had this little wooden cabinet thing built into the wall beside the toilet, It held toilet paper. The bottom shelf slid out and I kept a bag of my ""prized possessions"" in the hole in the bottom. I think it was mostly stickers or figurines or something. Silly stuff. I put the necklace in there of course. One day I brought it up to my dad again, and he told me to go get the necklace so we could fix it. It was gone though. No paranormal stuff there though, just my mom tidying up and seeing a bag full of what she saw as junk and throwing it away.

I was pretty angry about that though, because I don't think I ever thought of it as mine so much as I thought of it as theirs. (Hers ??) Either way, after my mom threw out the necklace the voices and seeing things out of the corner of my eyes ended.

I'd provide photos we took ourselves but they're on a drive somewhere upstairs. Plus, this was when digital cameras/cell phones/etc were just starting to become a thing.

Umm, that's about it though. We moved when I was 11 or something, I can't remember. My parents wanted me to go to a better middle school. The new house was a brand new house in a growing subdivision so nothing too spectacular happened there. Just a few unexplained broken dishes when no one was around them and cups falling off counters. Nothing worth another post. 

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this retelling of an event in my life. There were parts typing it where I got chills remembering it. It'd probably be creepier if they'd been angrier ghosts, but I'm pretty content with what I got.",,False,,t5_2sntx,1370330440.0,,,True,t3_1fmzry,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1fmzry/me_pic_the_necklace/,
1365711004.0,20,self.Thetruthishere,1c5o4g,[ME] Recent oddness re: our security system,Red1332,28,8,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1c5o4g/me_recent_oddness_re_our_security_system/,"Having lived in an old house during my childhood filled with the stereotypical shadowed places and its fair share of very strange happenings (a post for another time) so when my husband moved in to our current home I knew immediately it was the polar opposite of that situation; bright all the time with tons of windows and high ceilings, relatively knew (We're the 3rd owners, it's 15 years old, and all previous owners had young children and no tragedies).

Needless to say, I've been pretty damn confident that this house is NOT haunted.

Starting about 2 months ago we've started to have strange things going on with our security system, where it would randomly go off while we were home in the evenings. The strange thing is that it monitors the doors and windows and tells us which are opened, and none were ever open. Even after going around to check and opening and closing everything, it was obvious everything had been securely sealed.

Let me also stress this system has only been installed for one year, so it isn't a matter of Tech Alzheimers kicking in as can happen with older systems.

On another occasion we were awoken by the alarm going off at 2 am, and after falling down the stairs in a near-stupor, discovered the back door in to our garage was open a mere crack. The garage door was closed and had been closed all evening and cannot be lifted manually without making a ton of noise. I slammed the door and locked it because my adrenalin was sky-high at that moment. I also knew that the system didn't let us arm it unless every door was firmly closed and locked.

I was willing to write the other stuff off to technical weirdness or the door not being seated properly when locked despite registering that way... until last night.

We were getting ready for bed and my husband went to arm the system for the evening when it started going off. It wouldn't stop going off no matter what he did, and finally after unplugging the main unit and replugging it, he got it to stop.

The error message on the screen kept scrolling ""system tampered"". We were understandable freaked out, because it had operated for a year without issues, and as mentioned, if something was wrong where something wasn't closed it simply wouldn't let you proceed to arm it.

The security system called, stating they couldn't tell which entrance had caused the alarm to go off, and also had no idea why it was giving the error it was. We figured out rebooting the main unit cleared the error and allowed us to look at the door sensors... yet again, not  single one out of place, everything marked as closed and still.

We did the usual, going around to verify everything was closed, and it was... except for the basement.

My husband, the dog and myself trudged down there and checked every crawl space, storage room and area, and double verified the door was locked and couldn't open. We were opening our mouths to laugh at the situation when seven distinct, loud knocks (or footsteps) came from the kitchen directly above us.

We froze, then ran upstairs to see if someone was messing with us. No one was there. Just in case the security company had called the cops, we checked the front door. Nobody there. we went through the downstairs and upstairs again with a fine tooth comb. Nobody.

At that point I was more than a little freaked because the loudness and the deliberate timing of knock - pause- knock -pause- for all 7 of those knocks or steps or whatever did not leave us room to imagine that we had heard something. It was something striking wood, and we couldn't write it off as pipes or anything else, as they'd never made that noise.

Finally deciding there was nothing else to be done, we reset the alarm and went to bed. At that point the dog was acting very strangely, cowering and staying very close to us. One of our cats came running up the stairs a minute after we were upstairs, obviously spooked out with his tail and body poofed out and eyes VERY wide. I have not seen him do that for the better part of 8 years, so it was noteworthy. He just doesn't freak out usually.

Neither of us slept very well, listening for noises. I thought I heard something fall and roll but it was very muffled so I wrote it off as possibly the neighbors outside.

This afternoon as I was getting ready for work I was looking for something and poked my head down the basement stairway to see if I'd left it down there. That was when I saw all of the things I had placed on the stairs to take down to the basement in a neat pile at the bottom, including a cardboard tube that was likely the source of the bouncing and rolling I heard last night right after we went upstairs. I closed the door, looked at the dog and said ""We're done here."" and went to work.

This happened back in my 2003, I was a Junior in High School, and I awoke one morning to find a large circle of blood in the middle of my bed. the size was if you were to give someone the ok sign (pointer finger and thumb making a circle).
When I saw the circle of blood I was alarmed to say the least! I checked my body all over, looking for a cut or blood on my clothes. Nothing, not a spot of blood anywhere but in the middle of the mattress( where my belly button would have been). I thought maybe I somehow got my head down that far, and had a nose bleed, but there was no blood on my pillow, nor was there a trail of blood leading back to the pillow.
When I showed my mom, she thought it was strange, but we had no clue what to make of it. So that's all the ever came of it. I read somewhere before, but was unable to find the source again, that a spot of blood in the middle of your bed, was a sign of abduction.

This was a few weeks ago, on a Sunday. I had been living on a couple/three hours of sleep a night all week, writing a paper for class (I work full time and go to school), and by the weekend I was spent. I had slept in, and was having a lazy day around the house, just messing with the webz and catching a couple TV shows online.

So, I take a break from my screen to mess with my cat, who likes to start pawing at my arm for attention. He flops down to the floor, turning over to get me to scratch his belly, the thing he loves most in life. So I go to the floor to properly bellyrub him, and we spend a while being all /r/awww. I completely fall asleep at the relaxation of it, for maybe less than an hour. Here's where it gets strange.

I wake up, somewhat abruptly, realizing that I've been asleep, and not wanting to be up all night after having slept all day. I'm lying on my back (my cat had gone to my room to sleep on the bed), and I open my eyes. Directly in my line of sight, above me on the ceiling, the biggest goddamn Spider I have ever seen, in life, in pictures, on the TV, or in the movies. It had to be 8 or 9 inches across, and it was *moving*.

I jumped straight up, and ran clear across the room, shouting obscenities. You see, I suffer from arachnophobia, actually I have trouble with anything that has lots of legs or flutters around through the air. This, since I spent some time living in the woods as a child, but that's another story.

I knew before I turned around, that it would be gone. Just as soon as I had a coherent thought, I knew it couldn't be real. And of course, I turned to see: nothing. I know it wasn't really there, despite having been literally as clear as day. I live in the north, have all my life, nothing like that lives around here. Even if it was a pet gotten loose, I would have likely seen it again by now, alive or dead of cat attack. 

An optical illusion is just as unlikely. Setting aside the old 'I know what I saw' claim, I am very nearsighted, and was wearing my glasses. If it was something small, very close, it couldn't have been in focus. Nonetheless, I've held that as an outside possibility, along with the escaped pet theory, . There is of course also a thin possibility that I simply imagined it. The remnant of a dream, or the vision of emerging madness.

However, I have a friend, a somewhat mystical fellow, who has a different theory. This friend believes that we are in the midst of spiritual forces and entities, as many of you might believe also. His assertion, is that we may occasionally come under attack by malevolent spiritual forces or entities, for various reasons. I'm not one to believe in this sort of thing, but his theory might be argued to have some supporting evidence.

You see, the previous day, Saturday, I was also woken under a strange circumstance. In bed at a predawn hour, I awoke for no good reason, probably just habit after getting up on a few hours rest every night that week. I vaguely remember dreaming about my dad, not unusual since he passed away almost a year and a half ago. I lost my mom as a young man, and a brother a couple years before dad, and the dreams were a thing with all of them.

Anyway, so I had turned over, just kind of looking off to the corner, not really thinking anything, just waiting to drift off again. Out of nowhere, my father comes walking purposefully into the room, stops at my bedside, and abruptly makes a sweeping gesture with his arms over my body. His motion is so abrupt as to startle me, awake.

I find myself opening my eyes, startled awake from this apparent dream, lying in the same position, looking in the same direction, and seeing the same view of the room, sans papa. That was very odd to say the least. And a final detail, I had a decent view of the room, even in that predawn hour, since I sleep with a nightlight on. The reason being, that one night, soon after my father passed, I did open my eyes to see what I can only describe as a hand of colored light reaching out towards my face.

It dissipated almost immediately, and I've told myself that this was just some residual dream imagery, but now I sleep with a light on.

I'll never be one of them. I'll never be able to do this. There's no point in any of it, why do I even bother? I'm probably just insane anyway.* If you subscribe to religion, I believe this is what the Devil wants to tell us.

So what do you think? Am I insane, or did I see something real? Is there a big hairy bug running around my apartment, or is there a demon inside of me? Did my father show up to try and ward it away?

1360805791.0,20,self.Thetruthishere,18hgdg,"[ME] [FR] Blue 'flash' in the sky, strange happenings after.",Hargyhargyhargy,30,10,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18hgdg/me_fr_blue_flash_in_the_sky_strange_happenings/,"I will preface this with the fact that we were stoned teenagers.  So, warning, I guess: drug use involved.

Some background on this story: Small towns are quiet at night.  This particular small town was situated pretty close to a large Airforce base, famous for a certain hangar, and some questionable testing.  This particular small town was also said (by people who know these things) to lie on a convergence of powerful Ley Lines (lines of power that criss cross the earth).  I don't know if the AFB or the mystical power lines have anything to do with what happened, but I'm willing to go with any explanation.

A muggy 2 or 3 AM Saturday night in the late summer/early fall (We were in high school, and it was in session) of 1996 found three of us sitting on the front porch of my buddy 'J's house.  J and 'S' had just gotten off late shift work, and I usually didn't sleep till early morning anyway, this porch fit the bill as somewhere safe to smoke a joint and bullshit for awhile.  The view was westwards, with a clear view of the sky obstructed only by a few trees on each side.  J was taking a hit from the first joint of the morning, about 3/4th of the way done.  J is not known for passing to the left in a timely fashion, in fact, he's one of those guys that tend to use a roach like a microphone.  Telling some dumbass story between puffs, insuring rapt attention, just spouting off whatever comes to his mind.  ""I'm tellin' ya, man, we could just rob the bank!  It would be ea-""  

He just stops talking.  Not after a sentence, not after a word, just goes *silent*.  At the same time, I feel every hair on my body start to stand on end.  This next part probably took only a few seconds, but it felt like a few minutes.  Slowly my head turned (I was looking at the stars) to look at J.  I can't quite explain how this felt.  Not like something was making me look at things, but like I had to.  Or something.  Can't really put in words.  J and I locked eyes, a look of surprise on his face, and I imagine mine, too.  Slowly my head turned to look at S.  Same thing, surprise, locked eyes.  The hair on my arms, and back of my neck were standing at attention, like there was electricity palpable in the air.  Slowly, and I remember noticing we were doing this at the same time, we all looked to he sky west, towards the AFB.  Everything we could see was suddenly reflecting a bright blue light, as what I can only describe as a ribbon of bright blue something rips through the night sky.  Looks like: [this, the leading edge of an expanding supernova](http://i1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd502/nurekowser01/1-death%20of%20universe/3-2supernova.jpg).  We could see enough of the sky to tell it had a definite curve to it.  What ever it was, it was moving fast, but slow enough to see it.  It passes with no sound.  I can't talk.

All of the lights on the street turn on.  Not the street lights, those were already on.  Every light in every house on the street turns on, for a split second.  Like a flash from a camera.  I can't remember if, like plugged in appliances came on (like the TV), didn't hear anything, and it happened so fast.  The next second, the whole town goes dark, the only thing audible is a slow winding down 'whirring' sound, the dying of the sound of electric power that's always there, just not noticeable to people who live with it 24/7.  I still just can't talk.  Like some process in my brain shut down.

We are all still staring at the sky, held there like some kind of trance.  Maybe at this point just too shocked to do anything.  Out of nowhere comes a small, white car with no headlights on.  It parks across the street from us.  This is a small town.  No one drives around after 10 PM or so, everyone should be in bed.  The drivers side door opens and a man we have never seen before gets out.  All the power is still out, but enough of a moon to see almost clearly.  Slowly our heads tilt down to look at this man as he walks around the car to lean against his hood.  Staring at us, us staring at him.  Felt like 5 minutes at least.  None of us can talk.  For however long, he stares at us, and then just gets back in his car.  Starts it and drives down the road.  We can now talk.

""Holy shit, what the fuck just happened?""  ""How long were we like that?""  ""I felt like I couldn't look away.  Could y'all move, like, at all?""  ""Who was that guy?""  ""Did you see all the lights turn on?""  ""Let's call the cops.""  ""Why couldn't we talk?""  ""What the fuck?""

As we were trying to collect our thoughts, our young female friend, JL, comes walking up out of the darkness down the street.  ""Thank god you guys are up, Listen:""  ""Holy shit, JL, did you see what just happened?""  ""No, guys seriously, I thought I was about to be kidnapped or raped...""

What?

JL's story was just like ours, but she was alone: Hair standing on end, stopping everything (she was walking home from a friends house,) Strong feeling that she had to look to he sky, blue ribbon in the sky.  (At this point in JL telling us what happened to her, the streetlights are coming back on, flickering, but one at a time, not all of them at once.  Also, peoples house lights are coming back, but randomly.  Like a porch light would flick on at one house, and the kitchen light in another house would power up.  Not all at once.)  As JL is transfixed at the sky like us, a car pulls up across the street from where she is standing.  Someone she doesn't recognize gets out, leans against the car, and stares at her.  She can't move or talk.  She can just stare back.  Dude gets back in the car after an indeterminable amount of time and drives off.  The thing is, she couldn't of been more than a half a block away from us, and we only saw one car.  Could of been the same one, but then you get into time dilation.  I don't want to go there.  We talk about it for awhile, walk JL home, and call it a night.

That Monday in school, I try to tell a friend about what happened, he cuts me off and tells the same story.  Same story, except the were in the middle of the 'golf course' of our local college.  Pretty much a 4 acre field surrounded by houses on most sides.  Same story, there were 5 of them partying, someone was talking when they just stopped.  Hair standing on edge, staring at the sky, blue flash, something blue ripping through the night sky.  But, they were in the middle of a field.  Someone they have never seen before walks up from nowhere, stops about 10 feet away, and just stares.  Walks away after some amount of time.

We asked the cops about what happened, their official story was that a transformer blew up.  We asked the cop that was on duty that night what he saw.  He didn't answer the question.

I tell this story a lot, trying to figure out what we witnessed.  An EMP is the most likely estimation.  Power escaping from the Ley lines is another.  I can't say what it was.  At a bonfire one night, as I finished telling this, a friend who is a little older had his own story to tell.  He and another friend were in the downtown area, tripping on the acid, just hanging out.  He said he didn't notice anything weird except a bright blue flash, and all the power going out.  What he did notice, a few minutes later, were two women, ""dressed like witches, or something"" standing in the middle of the main street, staring at them.  They turn, and walk away south.  The street lights turn on as these two women walk under them, all the way down the street.

In 2005 my Family got our first digital camera.  I was in the ninth grade and was obsessed with it.  I loved the idea that I could take so many pictures and view them back instantly.  I thought it was the coolest thing.

We had the camera for a few months when we took it that Christmas to a family get together in the upstate of South Carolina.  We took many pictures that day but we did not scroll through them until a few days after.  What we saw was disturbing, to say the least.

Halfway through the pictures of the family Christmas party was a picture of a woman that we did not initially recognize.  It looked as though she was talking a “selfie” of herself in a bathroom that we did not recognize.   She was not a member of our family, she was not at the party, and the bathroom was not the bathroom of the house we were at.  We were baffled at how this picture got into the middle of our memory card and then we noticed something.  The women looked like an odd version of my mother.  My mother was in her early 40’s at the time and she has very distinctive features:  natural blood red hair (that she has never dyed), crystal clear blue eyes, and she had always looked very good for her age.  The lady in the picture seemed to be a demented/older version of my Mother.  The lady in the picture had the same eyes and the same hair but she look gaunt and at least 20 year older.  The lady in the picture had shrunken in eyes, wrinkles and bags everywhere, and looked as if she did age well.  She looked like a version of my Mother if my Mom had never taken care of herself.  She looked like a version of my Mother who had devoted her life to habitual drug use.

We freaked out and next time we had family over we got the camera to show them.  But the picture was gone.  We searched through the entire memory card, even putting it in the computer, but it was not there.  Baffled, we forgot about it.  Until a few weeks after and we were looking through the pictures and it had returned.  Freaked out, we quickly printed the photo out.  The picture continued to disappear and reappear on the card over our time using the card.

I searched all day through old memory cards and my mother dresser to find the picture but came up with nothing.  But it’s still engraved very vividly in my mind.

Anyone else ever heard of anything else like this happening?

It was Friday night and I had just woken up from a dream I did not remember. I tried looking at my clock but I couldn't make out any of the numbers. Generally a common way to recognize lucid dreaming.

I felt the urge to pee so I was going to get up to go to the bathroom when a man with a mustache was kneeling at the side of my bed. I only caught his face which I still remember vividly. He had sullen eyes with bushy white eyebrows. A cumbersome mustache just tipping over his upper lip. The look of a miner from the forties best describes his aura. 

He told me in such haste; ""There's a snake in your bed!"" I literally have never jumped so fast in my life. I was instantly sitting on top of my sheets Indian style trying my best to create a seal while trying to decide what to do with the snake. 

'Was it moving?' 'How did it get there?' 'What the hell am I going to do to get it out?' All these thoughts went through my head as I sat there playing defense. All of a sudden it was just a feeling I had. It's indescribable but I just knew I had finally woken up.

I could finally read the clock. It said 12:07 am. I was wide awake and giggling at my recent experience. As I walked to the bathroom I had that nervous laughter that lead into a fit of good laughter while taking my pee. My little brother asked me the next day when I arrived home from work what was so funny that I needed to laugh about so loudly? 

I used to go through bouts of sleep paralysis as a child and this was as close to physically terrified I had been in quite some time. It honestly scared the living shit out of me for a good minute. 

tl;dr: I woke up and was told there was a snake in my bed by a dream man. I did my best to keep it from getting me until I was fully awake. Good laughter ensued. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_18a8sy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18a8sy/me_waking_up_from_sleep/,

We both glanced at it but both ignored it, putting it off as a tractor or farm vehicle of some sort. We keep walking when we both get a strong whiff of ozone.
Both of us turned and looked at the field, just in time to see what we can now appreciate to be an orange ball of light a few meters round rise and then fucking rocket into the air, soundlessly.
We both stood still for a few seconds, then bolted like hell down the road, sprinting until we both nearly collapsed. We ran most of the way back to his place, and told his parents what we'd seen.

A friend and I were out in the woods hunting all of last weekend, staying at a cabin his dad and dad's friends built out there. We slept on mattresses in a sort of open loft/balcony. I woke up one morning, cold and needing to pee, as usual. As I considered getting up I heard something below in the main cabin room. It got louder and sounded like footsteps creaking against the wooden floor. I thought ""is my friend already up?"" but then I noticed his snores not far away. I thought ""is someone else here?"" since this cabin is used by his dad's whole group of friends for hunting, so I sat up to see who it was. No one was there and the footsteps had stopped. I got up, woke my friend up, and we proceeded with our hunting. I mentioned it later and we both just laughed it off.

I'm sure your first thought is sleep paralysis or something similar, but I had a few sleep paralysis experiences many years ago as a teen, and this was nothing like that. No crushing feeling, no irrational dread, no actual paralysis. There was no transitory feeling from lying down to sitting up at all. I didn't even think anything of it at first. The creepy implications dawned on me slowly, after the fact. Some other kind of hallucination? Possibly, but if so, it's a first.

It's certainly unusual enough I think albeit it's not a scary story. Here's the text of the original post anyway:

This is my first time posting on this page (cool subreddit by the way) so I hope that my story is relevant here. I wouldn't post it if I didn't think it was but if it's not I'll accept that and remove it. Anyway...

Almost four years ago in a short period of time a series of remarkable events changed my life. I cannot share my full story, but there is one thing that happened that I feel more comfortable posting about on here. Note, while I did experience some very strange things it must be taken into account that this also occurred within the context of mental illness. There were undeniably pathological elements at play here as well, I'm talking psychosis and temporary insanity. I'm fine now but I was not at the time of the initial sequence of events. I hope you can still read this with an open mind and come to your own conclusion instead of dismissing it out of hand.

So after the illness I voluntarily admitted myself to a psych ward. There I was put on medication and while still a bit manic and confused, there was clearly a drastic improvement in my condition so when what I'm about to tell you about happened there were not really any other factors that could have clouded my judgement at least in relation to what I believe to be the significance of this particular event. I found myself talking by my bedside to a patient who I had become friendly with, let's call him X. I don't know how we got into it but he was sharing a story with me about a time in his life where he felt he was going to die. He had to go to hospital and rather curiously he was experiencing difficulty breathing, he told me he felt a terrible restriction in his breathing like he was being choked and felt he was about to die. Enter another person, let's call him Y. A few minutes after X told me this story and we had returned to the main area of the ward Y approached us clearly and visibly shaken. He wanted a word with us. There he explained that he could overhear our conversation, that he had been in the room at the time near his bed but his curtains were drawn so we didn't see him. At the time of X and I's conversation, Y, who suffers from chronic depression was attempting to strangle himself with a cord. He pulled down his jumper to us and showed us the cord mark around his neck. He claimed that he was passing in and out of consciousness, where he could hear X talking about a restriction of breathing and a feeling of being choked and when he was fading he found himself having a lucid experience where he was in a meadow, where a middle aged woman whom he did not recognize approached him and simply said ""not yet"". With his last bit of strength he grabbed the cord from around his neck and pulled it off him. This was Y's version of events and as I already said I saw the cord mark around his neck myself. I think this is a relevant story to share here but if I've overlooked some guideline I will remove it if necessary. If it's ok, then I'd love to hear you guys and girls perspective on it.

When I was in college I worked at Denny's on the weekends for gas and food money. The one I worked at was attached to a hotel by the interstate and was usually busy 24/7. When I started working there some of the staff would tell stories about ""Boots"" which is the name they had come up with for the ghost they blamed for mysterious things that would happen. I love a good ghost story, but I never really took the idea seriously. According to the server who talked about Boots the most, stuff usually happened when the staff was tense or fighting with each other. 

The first strange thing that happened was that whenever I used the vacuum it would start smoking. I would call someone else to look at it, we could never find a problem, and it would work for other people, but after 3 or 4 times in a row where it would start smoking when I used it, but instantly stopped when I handed it off for someone else to use, I started refusing to vacuum the floors, and would trade off side work chores with the other servers to get out of vacuum duty.

The second thing was that on a particularly stressful night shift a coffeepot exploded in a girl's hand. This happened as she picked it up, not setting it down (which could be blamed on her slamming it down). Luckily it didn't have hot coffee in it at the time, she was getting it to make a new pot.

The kicker for me was one day I was in the back on a break talking to my manager and a plastic tub (the kind we use to hold ingredients on the salad line) that was on a dish drying rack FLEW across the kitchen, landing a good 15 feet away. I was spooked, as there was nobody near enough to the rack to have possibly bumped into it or thrown it as a joke.

If you walk through my neighbors' heavily wooded backyard, you can hop their tall, solid fence and get into the elementary school field.  There weren't any lights near the area we were going to, but the moon was fairly bright.  

We decided to go over to the playground to hang out, and took a shortcut through my neighbors' yard.  Scott climbed up first so that he can help us girls get up over the fence.  He sat on the top of the fence and said, ""Hey, there's somebody in the field!"".

I was the middle children, i have one older brother and one younger brother.

I lived in a second-world country where although things are pretty modern, spiritualism and shamanism thrives in rural areas. Although the city where i live is pretty modern, there is a lot of unexplainable stuff happened here.

Right in front of my house, theres a small road and a small police post there, where the security guard usually patrols around during the night

So this story happened when i was 12 years old (i am now 21) . My brother was 17, and my younger brother was 8

We live in a decently-sized house with our parents and two maids. 
One day both of my parents have some business trip, so the house is empty.

Me and my brother, being a kid, decided to play fifa all night, plugging my playstation in my parents room tv to celebrate

After about 2AM, someone started calling my older brother name. Not his name, his ""close-family-nicknames"" where only my parents and my brother know about it. Heck, he didnt even tell his friends because the nickname sounds silly.

The voices continues for about 1-2 hours.. Calling ""echa...echa...echa...""

The voice sounds eerie and weird. I tried sleeping but i just cant.. After the voices is gone i managed to go to sleep.

At the morning, i ask everyone in my house about whether or not they hear it. All my maids and drivers heard the voices. Funny enough, the security guard who patrols in front of my house DID NOT HEAR ANYTHING.

The next night, because i was scared of the voices, i slept early.

And fuck, i wokened up by the calling voices. The voices came up again, calling my older brothers name. It was loud, clear and god its so goddamn eerie..

At the morning, i asked people at my house. And they did hear it..

Here's the creepy part. The police often put a small chair in front of my house. During that night, he see white shades sitting there. Thinking that its just his imagination, he sit on the very chair. He then proceeds to feel like someone is strangling his neck for a few minutes.. then lose consciousness..

The next day my mother came home. She calls someone who understood this sort of thing and proceeds to exorcism..

For 2 days, all of my houses floor are covered with salt, and i start to read prayers before i sleep.

The voices never came up again..",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_12210n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/12210n/me_voices_in_our_yard/,

One of the boys (Alex) I worked with was quite verbal, but had one hell of a speech impediment (which I became damn good at understanding). Alex also had difficulty with option questions ""Do you want A or B?"" ""Is this X or Y?"", and would always just repeat the last option given (even if it was clearly something he hated/not the correct answer).  This is a (true) story about events that occurred in his home when he was 6 years old. 

I worked in Alex's home for a few weeks before his family moved. Prior to the move, Alex slept through the night, and I never felt ""uncomfortable"" in the home. The family moves to a bigger, ground-level apartment in a 4 unit building a few blocks away. Alex immediately begins to have night terrors (before anybody asks, he was NOT being abused), and always awoke between 9:30 - 11:00pm. He'd be screaming, shaking, and sobbing, and babbling when he woke up. 

I'd come the next morning (3 days a week) before he had school, and I'd work with him (behavioral intervention, self-help skills teaching, etc). I immediately felt uncomfortable in the apartment, but specifically in Alex's room. This went on for TWO YEARS (Alex had night terrors the whole time). I finally brought it up to the mother (Fiona) one day after we'd put her son on the bus. 

Me: ""Hey, Fiona, this is going to sound silly, but do you ever feel uncomfortable or like someone is watching you here?""

Fiona: *laughs* ""Oh, you mean in Alex's room? Next time you feel that way, ask him who is in there with you?""

Me: ...

A few days pass, and Alex and I are sitting on the floor (I have my back to his bunk bed), and I suddenly get the feeling like I'm being watched and the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Feeling a little foolish, I decide to have Alex switch places with me (making a silly game of it) so I can keep an eye on the bed. Feeling even more foolish, I decide to follow Fiona's advice and ask Alex who is in the room.

Me: ""Hey, Alex, who is in the room right now?""

Alex: *still laughing from our ""silly switcheroo game""* ""MayMay, Alex, and Tommeh."" (Amy, Alex, and Thomas)

Me: ""Oh, Thomas? Like Thomas the Train?""

Alex: *suddenly somber faced* ""No MayMay, Pooky Tommeh."" (Spooky Thomas)

Me: *trying not to piss myself* ""Hmm. Where is Spooky Thomas right now?""

Alex: *points to top bunk* ""Up dere.""

FUCK THAT. I decided it was time for us to work in the living room for the rest of the day. 

Alex, when asked what Spooky Thomas looked like, was able keep his answers consistent, even when the ""X or Y"" formula was reversed. If you're curious, he's small with dark hair. 
Alex continued to see Spooky Thomas and have night terrors until they moved. After they moved, neither happened again.

I have more creepy shit revolving around the relationship between  Ouija boards, Spooky Thomas, Alex's night terrors, and that damn house. If anybody is interested, I can elaborate.

After a few comments on a post on here, I was asked to share some of what my mother told me as a child about Ouija Boards and her experiences with the paranormal. 

I won't dramatize it, but here are a few facts she shared with me.

-My mother claims that the women in her family have a tradition of sensitivity and involvement in the occult. 

-She used it a few times as a child with her grandmother (allegedly a practitioner of magics) as well as her sisters, and gained an ""imaginary friend"" (among other less friendly encounters) which she claimed made its (non-aggressive) presence known up until she left home at 28. The cool thing about this story is they three (My mother has two sisters) all saw and interacted with it. I've spoken to them both about it and they've concurred with the story.

-Her Aunt (my great aunt) had developed mental issued late in life and died of unrelated health complications, however my mother claimed her insanity was because of regular attempts she made to contact her dead husband (through a ouija board and additional ""brujeria"" - a spanish term for hoodoo, witchcraft, etc etc) that resulted in a less than benign presence focusing on her. I actually got a chance to visit my Great Aunt's home in South America when I was 13, and I can only say this - the place was freezing in the middle of the day, and certainly had a ""mood"" about it. She never mentioned anything to me while we were there.. but I definitely made the connection later.

It was 3AM and I was on Gmail talking to my then boyfriend. I wasn't allowed to use the computer past 12 but I did it anyways. 

If the door was closed or partly open, I do not remember. I mostly always have it closed, so let's go with that.

I hear the doorknob opening (it sounded as if someone was struggling a bit to open it) and I immediately think ""OH crap, I'm in trouble.""
I hear my name in a loudish whisper. I couldn't tell if it sounded angry or suprised. It sounded like my mom.

I turn around and it wasn't her. It was this white, misty figure that looked like Edvard Munch's ""The Scream"" peeking in my room.

Surprised and a little scared of my encounter, I told my boyfriend what I just saw and I turn around again and it was gone.

I checked my parents' room, and they were both sleeping.

I love science and don't believe most ghost stories.  I would talk to people who had a ghost experience was never sure if I really trusted them.  Did they really see what they thought?  Now, I'm not even sure I trust my own, though it kind of makes ""sense"".

My wife and I were headed to the Cotswolds, an ancient area of the English countryside.  I wanted to stay somewhere old, so I found a really cool thatched cottage from the 16th century.  It was two stories, with original wood framed construction and a massive open fireplace.

When we got there, we were stoked.  It had a modern kitchen added on, but had the original beams and stone floor inside.  The bummer was that the fireplace had one of those small cast iron gas stoves in the center with the fake log inside.  There were a few candles around, so we lit those along with the stove and had a nice evening.

That night as we were in bed, I commented to my wife about the fact that this random cottage was older than any building in the US.  I realized that 500 years old means at least 8 full lifetimes, 20-30 generations.  That is a really long time.  People could have had their first sleep with their spouse, grown old, and then died in the room we were in - over and over.  Kind of weird.

The next day we went out exploring and came back cold and wet.  My wife went upstairs to change and I went to turn on the fireplace and light the candles to warm up the place.  I lit the fire with the little electronic ignition, then lit a few candles in the fireplace.  This is one of those medieval fireplaces that's like 8 feet across and 5 or 6 feet high.  It had old copper cooking pots arranged inside, etc.

Anyway, so I turn around to warm my bum in front of the stove, so I'm standing in front of the stove inside the fireplace.  And I look out at the room.

I swear - and I have never had this kind of experience before - that I could *feel* 500 years of people looking at that spot.  It was like all the evenings and energy, good and bad, of people in that room, watching the fire, was all focused there.  It was like the ghosts of the people's attention was so long and so intense that it stayed.  I felt like I could see the shadows late nights and kids and elders and generally rough folks.  One edge of the room felt like where the patriarchs would sit with their beer.  The floor was where the kids or the dogs would be.  It was almost like overlapping shadows of them were still there, all with eyes, all looking toward me.

The feeling was really otherworldly.  I was thinking logically - if there is anywhere for energy to be left over, this is kind of it.  Think how many hours people spent looking into that fire, watching it, warming to it.  There probably aren't many places on earth that have had that kind of long term focused attention than really old fireplaces.

I was so spooked, I wasn't sure what to do. I stepped out of the fireplace, and could *see* out in the room, the shadow energy.  I turned around in the direction it pointed, toward the fireplace, like my head was drawn there.  It was like magnetism.  Looking at the fire felt ""normal"".  It was only when looking the ""wrong"" direction, out into the room, that I felt like I was challenging the energy of the room.  The whole room had become almost slanted toward that fireplace.

I heard my wife creaking down the stairs.  Being the skeptic that I am, I thought, ""maybe this is just my imagination.  I should see if she notices the same thing without any prompting.""  I felt a bit guilty about asking her to stand in a fireplace - especially because I knew if she did see it, it would really freak her out.  But I felt like I had to be a good scientist and get another data point, just to see if it was all in my head.

When she got down the stairs I'm not even sure if I said, ""hey,"" when she saw me and screamed - a quick, short scream.  Then I started to say, ""never mind"" and she yelped again.  She later said she didn't know why she screamed, but I figure I must have just looked spooked.  So I gave up on asking her to step into the fireplace and told her a little bit of what I saw.

We were both spooked at the place after that, although I tried to be casual.  I turned on all the lights and ran down the hall to the bathroom when I had to pee in the middle of the night.  The truth was I could hardly hang in that house after that, even during the day.  It just felt like too much old energy, accumulated for too long.  I had always wanted to stay in old buildings or castles - now I felt like sometimes newer places that are *your* space are kind of nice too.

So that's all.  I don't know if it was real.  I do think that it makes a strange kind of sense to have energy like that in a place like that, but I don't know why.  It's not a fantastic ghost story, but it's the only time I've *really* felt like there was a presence that wasn't just the dark or the shadows.

I would ask, if you are ever in a place like that, please step into the fireplace at night and look out.  I am really curious if this is something that can be replicated...

now iv never actually seen any ""creepers"" at any of the places we have gone to but ironically enough my only experience (i think?) was while we were driving home from the farm place. 

the roads around there were covered in woods and had nobody on them since it was around 3 in the morning. as we came up to an intersection we saw a man. normally this wouldn't be THAT weird but there were NO houses in the area that we could see and he wasn't going anywhere. he was just standing and staring into nothing. the part that stuck out to me though is that he was wearing a suit. he was dressed like he was going to a fancy party on the edge of the woods. we were all really freaked out but we weren't sure if the guy needed help as we got closer he didn't move just stared at us so we told our friend to hit and gas and get us the hell our of there.

I am not a believer. There have been, however, a couple of true events in my life that I can't properly explain.

When I was in college, a group of six friends and myself were on college campus, fresh from the disappointment of a failed attempt to score some hash. The college has a large arboretum, that edges a wide slow moving creek. It was perfect California summer night, hot and muggy punctuated by gentle breaths of cool breeze. 

We were walking along a long stretch of path, a wide paved trail with a steep drop into the water on the left, and a steep incline up a hill to the right. We're talking too steep to go up without using your hands. On the incline to the right, a row of oak trees stood side by side with tall thin streetlights, casting the only light around, as it was a new moon. Ahead, we could see two hundred meters of trail, wide pools of orange light broken up by the deep black shadows under the limbs of the oak trees. But the path was flat and straight, so although the areas beneath the trees were inky dark, you could see there was no one else ahead of us on the path. The only sound was the gentle breeze and the frogs and insects in the creek.

We were walking in two rows of three, I was in the front, and during a lull in the conversation, was looking straight ahead when it happened. We were directly beneath a street lamp, and I was looking ahead to the next pool of light, maybe 20 meters ahead, and at the deep shadow beneath the old oak right ahead of us. I had the strange sensation that the shadow was swirling slightly, and I remember feeling equal parts confusion and vertigo. 

In the space between a breath, the sensation passed, and there was now a man, directly in front of me, 5 or 10 meters away. He was wearing only a pair of white jogging shorts, and white running shoes. He was old, silver unkempt hair on his head and his chest, and his skin was pale. He was looking ahead, seeming not to see us at all. It was such a jarring sensation, the suddenness of his appearance, that it only registered after another moment that he was making a great deal of noise. Jogging towards us, panting and wheezing, his footfalls were heavy slaps on the pavement.

I was more confused than scared, still trying to sort out how I had failed to hear or see his approach, which could have only been down the trail ahead of us, as the sides were too steep, and there was nothing to hide behind; the trunks of the oaks were several meters up the hillside.

He didn't acknowledge us, even as he approached us head on, and as I was wondering if perhaps I was hallucinating, the rest of my group parted to the sides and allowed him to pass right between us. He would have collided with us if we did not.

It had only been a second since I first saw him, but several strange things happened at once now. First, I remember wanting to turn around, to watch him go, but my neck refused to turn. At the same time, I could see in the corner of my eyes, my friends were all looking down, wide eyed, also not turning around, but visibly shaken. 

Then, after another heartbeat, the sounds of his heavy steps ceased entirely. Every one of my hairs stood straight up on end. 

I turned around first, but soon we all turned to look behind us. The path continued back from where we had come, straight and empty. A string of streetlights and oaks, casting shadows. And no runner.

No one spoke for nearly a minute. We turned and started walking again, all of us looking at our own feet.

When someone broke the silence, it was like a flood gate opened. We hollered at each other, talked excited and quick, comparing stories of what we had just seen. Only one other person was looking forward, but his story matched mine: He wasn't there, then he was. But we all heard him, the sudden sound, and then the sudden cessation when he vanished, and then nothing behind us. One of us swore up and down that he had seen the man grab his chest, but no one else could confirm that.

I wanted to go back, to run after him. Maybe he fell into the creek, or collapsed on the hillside in the shadow, I argued. I was out-voted. We walked quickly for the car, and proceeded to go home to get good and drunk. 

The next day, no one wanted to talk about. Half of us wanted to find a good explanation, to blame confirmation bias dor our matching stories, to find a good rational answer. The other were plenty happy to leave it, unspoken, behind us.

I'm still a skeptic. But it stuck with me. 

One of our friends later found work as a forensic investigator in the coroners office, in the same county. When going through a series of old files, he had found something interesting. He emailed me a photocopy of part of the report a few years later, the personal details blocked out with torn scratch paper.

In the late 70's, a prominent professor had died of a heart attack in the arboretum, while jogging on a summer evening.

I lived in a dorm building in an area of the city which has supposedly been decimated in the big earthquake. The dorm was brand new and really nice inside (later one of the guards told me the previous building in that spot collapsed in the earthquake and people were killed, but that is not something I ever verified).

One night, about two weeks into the first semester, I woke up around 3am in the morning.  I slept on the bottom bunk and sometimes my roommate, who slept on the top bunk, would wake me up with his snoring but I listened and didn't hear him. I opened my eyes to check the clock and saw a young woman with dark hair sitting at the foot of the bed. 

The woman immediately stood up and walked toward the door, then suddenly stopped and turned towards me. At this point I wasn't afraid at all, I think I assumed it was some girl from the dorm that had come in for some reason and I was trying to figure out who she was in the dark. When she turned toward me I could see her face and realized I did not recognize her. She began moving her mouth and gesturing with her hands as though she were talking to me, but no sound came out. I don't know why, but the impression I got was she was saying something like ""I'm gonna step out for a few minutes but I'll be right back"". 

I was still kind of clueless from having just woke up, so my thinking was ""who are you and why would you come back into my room when it's so late?"" Then the woman turned back towards the door, took a step forward and evaporated into thin air. It's the only way I can describe it, as she didn't simply disappear and blink out of sight. It was like she turned into a fine mist and just blew away. At this point I had only been awake for probably 15 seconds and I remember thinking ""I can totally freak out right now, or close my eyes and fall back asleep and deal with this in the morning, when the sun is out."" I closed my eyes, covered my head with my pillow and fell back asleep.

The next day I was walking back to my dorm from my morning class and I stopped to talk to my roommate who was standing outside smoking. We chatted for a minute, then the memory of what happened the night before suddenly came back to me, like when you remember a dream (which I suspected was the case in the safety of daylight).  I chuckled and said to my roomate, ""hey did you see anything weird in our room last night?""

My buddy Liam is a rather worrisome kid, he still has a nightlight and sleeps with the TV on and he's 19, there is nothing wrong with that, I'm just explaining for character profiling purposes. Liam's parents were out of town for the weekend and he asked if I could stay over at his house for a day or two. I told him I would and asked why he wanted me to. He told me that strange things have been happening in his house and didn't want to be alone. There was an ongoing joke before this event that he had a ghost in his house that liked to screw with him and his friends. We called him ""Jimmy"" and would always make jokes and blame Jimmy for weird things such as objects being moved or strange noises.

Liam told me that his dog has been just sitting and growling facing the dark hallway leading to his parent's room. He told me lights would go on and off and he even said that he heard the sink running in his parents room. So I go over to his house and we have a typical teenager night, video games and junk food. It starts getting late, circa 2 A.M. We decide to go to bed. He takes his dog and locks himself in his room with his TV on. I go into his guest room one door over. 

It was very dark when I closed the door, I didn't have a tv to turn on so I decided to go lurk reddit on my phone. I begin to get tired and start to close my eyes... then I hear the doorknob rattling. My first thought is ""Liam your a prick"" I get up and go over to the door. When I get there the door stops rattling, I open it up quickly to try and catch liam in the act, or running to his room, I opened it up to complete darkness, no Liam. At this point I NOPE NOPE NOPED right out of the room and knock on Liams door, I woke him up and heard his dog jump off his bed. He was asleep the whole time. I told him what happened and he just said ""Fucking Jimmy"" and threw a pillow on the ground and I fell asleep on his floor. The next morning I told him I wasn't gonna stay at his house that night. 

Anybody have a similar experience? Or an entity that is sort of a joker? I didn't feel like a malicious presence, But it scared me none the less.

Ok, a lot has happened since my last post here. And activity is now at an all time high within my household I'm going to break these new occurrences into 4 separate events.

.

.

.

.

EVENT 1: OUIJA 1 STRANGE LIGHTS AND DISTINCT SHADOW

Against my will and against all the advice that I took from here on my last visit my brother thought it would be an ingenious idea to craft a Ouija board. This happened during the time I was replying to all the questions in my previous post.

Iit was 2 Wednesdays (12th) ago that myself, my gf and my brother used a Ouija board. We used it on 2 separate times in the same night. The first time we used it around 9PM. The Ouija board was extremely crude and the slider wasn't sliding smoothly the only clarification we got were in the YES/NO questions.

I'm willing to write it off as crap but a saw a few things while we did this the first time. Firstly while asking the questions within the first minute I glanced to my left and saw the distinct outline of the Shadow Man. This time I got a better look at him me seems to only be about 4-5 Feet tall and is wearing baggy clothes so it's difficult to say what kind of build. I only saw him for about 3-4 seconds.

Secondly I was facing the television and I was purposely looking to see if I could see anything happening behind me in it's reflection. It's not an LCD screen so this is why I'm able to see reflections. Towards the end of the session I saw what appeared to be lightning spreading itself across the wall above me in the screen along the top. This happened for about 1-2 seconds. We then ended the session. We asked for a name and got VIGM... but I don't think this can be considered relevant because they surface we were gliding on was not smooth. So it could be a number of things. He also said he was not friendly.

EVENT 2: OUIJA 2 WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT

Ouija board again, same night but at 12PM instead. By this time my brother was fairly drunk and being really obnoxious in using the Ouija board. We got a lot of 8's. As in the slider was constantly moving to the number 8.. I looked this up and it generally means the spirit is pissed. We asked if it had anything to do with us and it said that it was following me. Shortly after we heard a very distinct rattle in our pipes. The only time you hear this rattle is when you turn the shower on. Nobody was using the shower and they never do that on their own.

Nothing else notable happened until after because my brother was being an idiot using the board. Right after we finished about 10-15 minutes later we were all in the hallway. I moved into my room, my gf was going to the bathroom and my brother went to the kitchen. Just as this happened my gf and brother both heard something happen in the end bedroom. This room is basically a spare room and is always kept tidy so that means bed is made, drawers closed etc. My brother went to investigate and I pointed out that one of the top drawers on one of the lockers was open.

What they heard was the sliding open of one of the drawers as we replicated the sound. This scared us quite a bit.

EVENT 3: BREATHING NOISES AND TUGGING

My parents are back in the house now at this stage so I thought that everything would go back to normal and that our minds were essentially playing elaborate tricks on us. 

They came back on the Sunday just gone (16th) and this was the first night I was sleeping in my room alone as my gf went back to her house. Each night I've gone to sleep I've heard what sounds like breathing at the back of my neck. I've tried relentlessly to figure out what's making the noise but I can't find anything. It sounds like it's coming off the wall. Shortly after I noticed the breathing I felt a small tug on the duvet towards my back and into my neck. There was no way it could have been me because I was lying perfectly still to try and pinpoint the sound.

I have heard this breathing every night since. And 2 nights ago I felt it pull on my t-shirt above my shoulder. And I have also seen what appears to be the air ""sparking"" one more time since Sunday, I wrote it off as me looking up at the light.

EVENT 4: LAST NIGHT

Ok, so last night I decided I'm absolutely sick of this breathing sound it's creeping the shit out of me. And it was, I was essentially scaring myself into sleeping for the last few nights.

So in a normal talking voice I asked whatever spirits were in my room to leave. The breathing stopped and I thought it was pretty cool. Next thing I hear this huge bang. Don't worry I know what it is, it's the dog. Just after I tell the spirits to leave I can hear him jump off my brothers bed (whose room is next to mine) and land on the wooden floor. He then starts scratching at the door. I was a bit freaked, but the dog has been doing this for a few weeks now so I'm not really surprised.

My brother gets up and ties the dog up in the porch, so I got the idea maybe it was my brothers breathing that I was hearing and it stopped because he woke up. So I get up and stroll down the hall to his room to listen to him breathing. It was barely audible even with the door open and me sticking my head in the door. I sort of laughed to myself and he told me when he went to put the dog out the front door was wide open.

This absolutely scared the shit out of me. I went and got the dog and brought him to my room straight away and key'd the front door closed. I started getting really freaked out. On top of that the dog was staring blankly at the wall opposite my bed and wasn't responding to my calls. He kept glancing at my room door as if he wanted to go out. I opened the door and let him out to wander in the darkness of the house.

I thought he'd go back to sleep in the living room as he usually does but he kept pottering around, so I thought fuck it I'm going to go see what's happening. So un-bravely I turned on all the lights and went out with the dog. I kept trying to get him to go to sleep and come back to my room, but all he did was lead me to the bathroom, I put him out again thinking he needed to go as he does this sometimes.

Naturally, he didn't need to go so I brought him back in, this lead to me following him to the bathroom 2 more times. This got me thinking maybe he wants me to look in the mirror in the dark... but I was honestly too freaked out at this stage so I grabbed him and let him stare at the wall all night as I fell asleep. I woke up several times in the night to see him still staring at the wall.

CONCLUSION:
I want to do an investigation I'm going to ask my friend to borrow his HD camera and leave it recording in rooms at night for the next week if I can get him to give it to me. Any thoughts or suggestions? Sorry this is a long read and I typed it all in one go so ignore any faults in my grammar.

I originally posted this on nosleep, shows my noobiness. This is my first time ever now reposting something on here so it's kind of a milestone I guess? Anyway, my story isn't an account of mine but rather the account of my uncle. Nonetheless it still has this creepiness which might make good discussing material.

This a relatively short story. It takes place during my uncle's childhood. He lived in a small town which had a campground on a lake near it. His family spent much of their time there during the summer months. When he was about 14-15 he said him and a group of five teens/kids were going back to their campsite for the night after a day at the lake. As they were walking on the trail back a humanoid creature came walking out of the brush and crossed the path. He told me that it was the ugliest thing that he had ever seen. It walked on all fours, but still would appear to be able to walk like a human. He said it had gray skin,a huge oval head, ratted hair, and red eyes. He said it looked at them and crossed the path into the woods. The entire group of kids were terrified. Being an enthusiast for cryptozoology, E.T.'s, etc. I immediately thought of the cryptid known as the Dover Demon.

I still live in the area and the campground is now closed though and is all private property. I'd like to investigate it someday.

Not much but a little odd. It was a few years ago and I was walking home from campus. It was about 7pm and just about getting dark. I was walking outside in a more open area, with a few paved paths going in different directions, and the library on one side and the business building on the other side. I was walking minding my own business when I felt a pretty big shove on my back right shoulder, like someone was behind me giving me a push on my shoulder. I remember I kind of stumbled because my shoulder went forward and threw me off balance. I figured it was one of my friends fucking with me so I quickly turned around ready to punch/push back but nobody was there. I did a full 360 to make sure I wasn't blind, and waiting to hear running footsteps, but saw and heard nothing. Closest person was 30ft behind me, was a regular studious looking blonde girl. 

I don't think it was my imagination. I remember thinking right after I didn't see anyone like holy shit did that just happen? The newly built library which I was about 20 yards away from was built over an unmarked burial ground. Bones of children and adults were found and recently studied by the university.

Before I continue I should also mention the house was built in the late 1800's.
The first thing experienced was the other day my girlfriend came home to find her toothbrush and toothbrush holder laying on the bathroom floor about four feet from the sink. No one had been in or out of the house since I left with the kids that morning. I was the last one in the bathroom and the items were on the sink when I left.
Yesterday morning I woke up (I was the only one awake) went downstairs to use the bathroom after I did so I returned to our bedroom to get ready for work. I went back down approximately 10 minutes later (still the only person awake) and walked into the bathroom to find a small bottle of shampoo sitting vertical in the middle of the floor.
Last night we had all gone to our old place to clean up and returned later that night. My girlfriends son went into the front room where the front door and it was open and unlocked. My girlfriend and I know for a fact that it was locked and closed when we left since we are security freaks. The other odd part is the screen door which you must travel through (it's an enclosed porch) was still locked.
Other odd things include unexplained sounds (and not just house settling sounds) these including knocking, footsteps, and general rummaging through our belongings.
I should point out that her son is 15 and could be labeled as a troubled teen, and one of her daughters is 10 and is about to hit puberty. From what I have read about poltergeists they tend to use the energy from kids like ours.
Another interesting thing is the house was rented to us at a to-good-to-be-true price and the previous tenant moved out three months prior to the end of their lease yet continued to pay rent but also refused to come back and get belongings. Our landlords also asked us about five or six times on whether we were positive that we wanted the place with almost apprehension in their voices.
If these kinds of things are already taking place only a week into our new lives there I am very curious as to what may happen in the coming months. What more should I expect to have happen? Should I have a paranormal group come investigate? Or should I just enjoy living in a haunted house?",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_l0qhj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/l0qhj/odd_happenings_at_my_new_abode_i_need_your_take/,

The first place me and my wife lived together was an apartment in a historic cattle town that served as a gateway to the west back in the day. The building our apartment was in was obviously an old house that had been renovated into apartments and quite old. Needless to say there was quite a bit of activity there, nothing too horrible. Uneasy feelings, odd sounds at night, shadows moving on their own, and on occasion small balls of light darting in and out of the bedroom closet.

The biggest thing that happened was my wife seeing an apparition. She got up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and saw a child standing in the kitchen. She turned on the light and the kid vanished. I ended up having to sleep next to the bedroom door for a month... Thanks honey, but then it got me away from the window and I felt that was a fair trade.

This was the window we would see people walk by, except the ground floor of this house was elevated, so the bottom of the window was approximately eight feet off the ground. This is also the window I would wake up trying to open when I had the dreams. Told you I was breaking a rule.

I had frequent dreams of Black Eyed Kids even though it had been years since I had read or even thought of them. It was almost always a little girl, about six or seven, and her even younger brother. The girl was the one would would talk, while the young boy just stared.

In one example my wife and I lived in a farm house, and the two children came to the screen door. The girl claimed they had been in a car accident just up the road, and that her parents were hurt. They needed to come in and call for help right away. Things that should have struck me as odd didn't. The kids were not in anyway hurt, disheveled, or even particularly anxious.

The longer I took to open the door the more impatient she got. My hand reached out and touched the handle when suddenly my wife warned me not to open the door. I looked at the children and noticed their eyes, all black. The feeling of pervasive evil and the outburst of anger from the little girl always shocked me awake.

Every time I would awake, and find I had undone the latch on the window in my sleep and was making as if to open it. Every time I had the dream I was interrupted, and awoke to find myself trying to open the window.

The dreams have stopped when we moved out of the apartment. Very interested to hear what TTIH thinks. And apologies for breaking the rules, hopefully it wasn't boring.



**TL;DR - **Had recurring nightmares about BEKs, and awoke from every one of the trying to open the bedroom window. But only had the nightmares while living in one place.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_jik2v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/jik2v/black_eyed_kids/,

A lot of the stories on here remind me of the experiences my family and friends used to share when I was a kid. I haven't personally had any interaction with any beings (that I know of) but my favorite story I've heard was from my sister.

She and her friend had just moved into a new apartment. They'd only been their a week when my sister (lets call her Sara) went into the kitchen for a glass of water at night. She thought she saw something out of the corner of her eye, but ignored it at first. When she turned in the kitchen she saw someone sitting at the dining table. They were wearing something like a hoodie, had its arms on the table, and its head was face-down like it was resting. She immediately went back into her room and locked the door. 

A few nights later, Sara was sleeping when she suddenly felt something grab her throat. It was holding on tight and she felt like she was suffocating. When she opened her eyes she saw a dark figure straddling her. From what i recall she couldn't see a face, but even if she did she was so scared she doesn't remember. We were raised in a christian home, so the word my sister thought to say was, ""Jesus!"" She was barely able to utter it while her throat was being held on to, but whatever it was let go and disappeared when she said it. 

They moved out of that apartment within the next week. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1jjq7v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1jjq7v/my_sisters_story_about_her_freaky_apartment/,

She would go outside to investigate but he would be gone when she went outside, she could only see him through her window, but it wasnt creepy or scary... the boy made her feel better... the boy would just look at her and smile which calmed her down and gave her the feeling that everything would be okay every day for days she would see this boy smile and sometimes wave and this would soon help her get out of her depression...

We were on the third floor, there was a dysfunctional family with 4 kids on the second floor and a couple of crackheads on the first floor (hey, we were trying to save money by living in a cheap place- lesson learned).
I got a lot of creepy somebody's watching me kind of feelings in that apartment, and occasionally I saw an old man in my peripheral vision standing there watching me. I was thinking that my brain must be filling in stuff that wasn't there, and it's a creepy old place so I was sure my imagination was running away with me. Then it got weird. I'd be going about my day and suddenly it'd get really cold and I'd see the old guy standing in doorways. It was the kind of cold where I could see my breath. Sometimes all of the drawers and cupboards in the kitchen would slowly open at the same time.
While all of this is going on, I was hell-bent on keeping up my ""nope"" attitude. I was thinking ""hey, my roommates haven't said anything so I'm sure everything's fine."" After a few months of this, my roommate decided to shatter my ""everything's fine"" illusion by telling me about her own creepy experiences, which were pretty similar to mine. She also said that she was sure that it was an old man that was haunting the place. I hadn't mentioned any of this to her by the way, she came to me on her own and told me about her own experiences. I waited until she was done talking before I added my two cents because I wanted to make sure I wasn't projecting my own ideas onto her experience.
It just got worse after that, the little girls from the second floor started asking their mom about the ""old man in the weird clothes"" that lives in their apartment. The mom told me about that and mentioned that all of her cupboards and drawers would fly open in her kitchen at the same time.
I lived there for a year. I decided to just interact with the old man by telling him to back the fuck off when I felt like he was invading my privacy (sometimes the air would suddenly get really cold when I was in the shower and I'd see shadows moving on the other side of the shower curtain. He was a pervy old dude). Telling him to leave me alone seemed to work pretty well, if I told him to back off he generally would. My roommate, on the other hand, was a Southern Baptist that decided to perform amateur exorcisms once a month while her boyfriend was standing watch via Skype (they were in a long distance relationship). She would put her hand on her bible and raise the other hand (like she's being sworn in as president or something) and shout ""LEAVE THIS PLACE, YOU DEVIL! IN THE NAME OF JESUS, GO!!!""

The summer of 2009, when I was 15, something really strange happened. On this day in June, I had happened to be home alone. The first time I had woke up, I saw that everyone had already left. I was like OK, fuck you all. I got up watched a bit of TV and dozed back off on the couch. Well, when I woke up I sat up slowly and glanced at the TV. Mind you, it's the middle of the day and the sun was shining brightly throughout the house. In the TV, I saw a reflection of a shadowy figure standing in my cousin's bedroom door frame. The sight shocked me awake and I quickly turned my head to see what it was, but I saw it move fast through my peripheral vision. I got up and called my bro to tell him about it. I left the house and didn't go back in until somebody else had come home.  

THE END, right? Not quite 

That next summer, 2010, I went down to Virginia to stay with my sister and her family. When I got down there, I was told to have fun. But when my sister and her fiance wanted a night out on the town, I was the designated babysitter for my niece. This night, they had went out to club with their friends and told me that they weren't going to be back for a while, so I would have to put my niece to bed. I agreed to do it. After I had put her down for the night, I was on the computer watching movies. I had just finished *Paranormal Activity* and was a little on edge. I looked up and noticed that all the lights were out except for the one in the guest room where I was sleeping. So I worked my way from room to room cutting the lights on and off as I went. When I got to my room, the door was open only a bit so I pushed it open the rest of the way. As I pushed it open I saw the same shadowy person from previously and it flittered away again. I ran into to the room cutting the light out and jumping under the cover in the same motion. I did not come out of it until the next morning.  I haven't the faintest idea what that was and I'd probably never want to know",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1i8dug,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1i8dug/beyond_a_shadow_of_doubt/,
1372612874.0,22,self.Thetruthishere,1hdfkr,[My] house is haunted,tkat13,33,11,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1hdfkr/my_house_is_haunted/,"Let me start this off by saying that the only reason I feel comfortable writing about this is because I’m not at my house. Currently, I’m in the car with my favorite grandparents heading back to my home in Connecticut from a family weekend in Vermont. It took me all weekend to work up the courage to write about this, and I know that it’s now or never. I’m honestly afraid that if they catch me writing about this, they’ll get mad and torture me more (although, I highly doubt it). However, they’re not here, so I’m hoping I’ll be okay.

Who are they, you ask? Well, you probably didn’t actually, but I’m going to tell you everything that I know about them. First, however, I need to give you some background. I live in a little suburban town in CT. It’s actually a really quaint place, quiet and full of trees. The house we live in is the one my mother picked when we moved (my father transferred jobs so we moved like 8 years ago); it was an older house that the previous owners had expanded on.

The new house has two floors, a basement, and an attic. When you first walk in the door, you find yourself in the living room, if you look to your right, there are two doors on the same wall, but on opposite ends. The one on the left leads to the dining room and connecting kitchen, and the one on the right leads to a small hallway that branches off to the laundry room, basement, and garage and leads straight to the bathroom and staircase. If you go up the staircase and look straight ahead, you’ll see the computer room and adjoining closet, if you look to your immediate right, you’ll see my sister’s room, and if you look to your left you’ll find the family room, my father’s room, and my room, which is right next to the bathroom. We never really go up to the attic, but there’s a ladder that you can pull down in the family room. I’ve never been up there, and it’s never really bothered me much. The basement is what bothers me.

I’ve only been down there once, and that was because my grandfather- the same one who I’m with right now- is an electrician and I was helping him do some work on the house. The basement opens with rickety, and slightly rotten, wooden stairs: the type that are just the planks, so there are gaps between each step. If you go all the way down and turn left, you’ll see an empty expanse of a dusty concrete floor, complete with a single draw-string light bulb in the center of the room. Everything is covered in cobwebs and dust. If you look to your immediate right, you’ll see a large mechanism that’s used to heat the house and supply electricity and water. If you go down the steps and take two steps to the right, and stay facing forward, you’ll find yourself facing a long, dusty hallway that’s about six yards long with a white door at the end of it. If you go through this door, you’ll find a sealed well that used to supply water to the house 100 years ago with a large water tank on top. Now, the water isn’t taken from the well, nor has the well been open for a good sixty plus years, but it’s still there because wells are apparently very hard to fill completely.

So, what lives here? I honestly don’t know much about them, but I’ve gathered a little from the seven years I’ve been here (I’m now eighteen) and I’ll simply relay what I know.

The first one seems to be the most harmless. He has never bothered me before, but he has shown himself to me.  He appears throughout my house randomly, and he definitely isn’t restricted to only coming at night, but night seems to be when he’s most active. I’m not the only one of my friends who’s seen him. He tends to like to basically patrol the house, this may seem stupid or clichéd, but he’s pretty much the guardian of the house. Not the people in it, but the house itself. He seems to be indifferent toward my family, maybe a bit curious and slightly watchful, but nothing sinister. Although I also don’t get the feeling he’s a ""good guy"" either. He always appears as a black shadow, a silhouette of a tall man. When he gets angry, or protective, the shadow swells and stretches toward you. You can actually look straight at him. He generally seems to try to sneak around, but when you do see him, it’s not out of the corner of your eye. I’ve seen him standing in the doorway of the living room while I was doing the dishes, and one of my friends saw him when he had to go back in the house because he forgot his keys, and once I woke up to him standing over my bed. I also hear his footsteps around the house sometimes, especially at night.

The second, and only other one in my house- that I know of-, is unquestionably dangerous. This one I’ve never actually seen in real life, thank God. But my dreams tend to put a face to it, even though I’m not sure if that’s actually what it looks like. All I know is that it crawls on the floor, it doesn’t reach up past my knee, it ""lives"" in the room at the end of the hallway in the basement, and it’s very presence in the house is pure evil. It likes to taunt me, and I’m not the only one who feels it here. At least four people I know have too. The feeling that it’s there, in the room with you, comes and goes though. It’s almost like it’ll lay dormant in the basement for weeks, then all the sudden I’ll be in the living room and I’ll feel something watching me. I’ll feel like if I look at the doorway leading to the hallway and basement, I’ll see whatever it is crawling into the room. it makes me terrified to look because I’m terrified of seeing it, but it makes me more terrified NOT to look because I know that if I don’t catch it far enough away, it’ll sneak up on me and do something awful.
Mainly it likes to stay in the basement, the hallway to my garage/laundry room, and the living room. But I also tend to get feelings that I’m being watched from the kitchen and from the bathroom/hallway on the second story, right next to my room. This one terrifies me. I almost want to know what it is, but at the same time I’m terrified of knowing. Something tells me that ignorance is bliss, but at the same time I feel that if I know what it is, I’ll feel less afraid of it.

The entire time that I’ve lived here, strange and terrifying things have happened almost non-stop. Recently, I was in the first-floor living room practicing piano. It was probably around 11 pm, and I’d been practicing for a good hour. Suddenly, I heard some movement in the basement. At first, I thought nothing of it, because we have squirrels in the walls and floors. However, within minutes, it turned from a light scratching, to a frantic clawing at the floor under me. It literally sounded like someone was trapped in the basement and trying to claw their way out. I got so scared; I sprinted upstairs to tell my father. He laughed and didn’t believe me; he said it was probably just a squirrel. It wasn’t a squirrel. We have those scampering around our walls all the time, this was much, much bigger.

Another incident I experienced recently was in my room. I was asleep, when I suddenly woke up around 2 am for no discernible reason. I was confused, and felt slightly nervous, but I shrugged it off and rolled over to go to back to sleep. I lay there for an hour, too tired to get up to do anything else, but too awake to fall asleep. About an hour later, I was still awake and seriously debating whether or not I should go downstairs and watch TV, when I heard some movement next to my bed. My breath caught in my chest and I froze. I swear, I heard someone shuffling and smacking their lips next to my head. My bed is set in a corner of my room, against two walls. The sound travelled from right next to my head, over it, to the wall, and back again. It went like this for a few minutes. Not only was something growling and smacking it’s lips, but I actually felt drool land on my shoulder and neck more than once. I was terrified, too terrified to move. I wanted so badly to call out to my father, or call someone so they could comfort me, but I just lay there, frozen and pretending to sleep until I the smacking stopped and I heard nails clawing at the foot of my bed. I snapped, shrieked, pulled my feet up to my chest, and called one of my friends in hysterics. There was actually some sort of clear liquid on my neck.

These are just a few recent incidents, and I’m sure they won’t be the last. I’ll update if anything else happens.

I also just want to be clear, this isn't a lie or fake. This shit really happens in my house and I'm terrified of it. I don't want to screw with the things in my house, so I'm just going to continue to ignore them and leave everything alone, but it still terrifies me.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1hdfkr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1hdfkr/my_house_is_haunted/,

She lived in the small town of Lexington, Virginia and when it comes to this town's past, well. The town is comprised of a bunch of old houses from the last 300 years, some of which are on top of the battlefields from the civil war (needless to say, you can see soldiers roaming, a lot).

One thing that has always stuck with me, is a story my mom has told me countless times over the years. In this story, my uncle had picked my mother up from the movie theater in the uptown part of Lexington after she got off work, there's a bridge that takes you to up to Campbell ln. if you're coming from main street, this bridge is high up, and surrounded by larde downhill slopes of trees and properties with long stairways winding down from the road, gated because somehow they think a chain fence will help stop a car from sliding down into their yard. Regardless, if you don't turn onto campbell, the bridge goes back down to route 11. my grandmother lived, and still does, on McCorkle drive, the first street on Campbell. When my mother and uncle were driving up the hill, she explained that it was foggy and they were taking their time, and then they saw this woman, with long grey hair and a poncho-like cloth draped over her, looking almost like a native woman and as they passed her on the hill, she went to open her poncho, staring straight at my mother, but they passed her before she revealed whatever it was and so my uncle quickly whipped the car around to find nothing. Now, i cannot express to you the impossibility of her hiding for there is nowhere to go besides downhill to her death, or onto a property and if that were the case, they still would have seen her on the long path. 

The weird part of this story is what happened two years ago, and what happened this summer.

My uncle mike, at the time of their encounter, was 19 years old. My mother was 16. 

Two years later, started dating a guy named Kendall. One night, my grandfather was home with my mother and her three siblings, all of which knew the story of this woman, but never spoke of it to anyone, including my grandmother, and Kendall, two people close to them. My mother and her immediate family were talking and watching television when there was a knock on the door. My grandfather answered it and Kendall rushed in, looked at my mother, and uttered words I believe she knew she'd hear one day ""Bridgette, you are not going to believe what I just saw."" He sat on the couch with all of them, now bear with me, I was not there, so I don't know exactly the story he had told, my mother only told me that he saw the same woman at the opposite end of the neighborhood where, once again but more extreme, there is nowhere to go but downhill and this time into a lake about 400 feet down an 80 degree or so steep hill. Once more, this woman lifted her ""poncho"" and disappeared into a foggy night.

Kendall was 19 at the time, my mom was 18.

This summer, I have had the privilege of driving BY MYSELF to places, my grandmother is a worry wart and I haven't been 'allowed' to go anywhere since i was only a teenager and apparently that meant that if I were to go out alone, I would die. So one night I went to play a prank on my friend here at the river, a few of us decided we were going to invite her for a midnight swim and dress up like river monsters, but it didn't turn out like we wanted it to. We failed miserably and she wasn't the least bit scared. Disappointed at 2 in the morning, we all just separated. Now, something about this town, Lexington. Every night there's some fog, it's part of living in/near mountains. But that night (Last friday June 13th or 14th or so.) it was so foggy I was driving like 12 miles an hour down the 35 mph road. I turned onto the bridge and accelerated until I saw a figure standing at the middle of the hill in the fog, a frail figure, short and somewhat... enchanting. I was going to slow down, but that would be creepy for I had no clue of who this was. As I passed, my heart stopped for I was looking into the eye of something my mother had seen 30 years ago, an old native-american looking woman. She had a long face, and though I saw it, all I was focused on was her hair, and her clothing, like my mom described to me so long before this, she had long ash colored hair, in a middle part, almost to her waist, as well as light canvas material draped around her shoulders, covering her body. As I passed, she started to lift the material up, and then she was behind my car. I did something that my uncle, mother, and Kendall had not. I stopped my car, shifted to park and then jumped out of my car. I looked around for half an hour, car running, and there was no one, no one had jumped, no one was around, no one on the paths or on the other roads. I was alone, and at that moment I realized something.

I'm 19 this summer.

What would bring her back? And what does it mean if we were all the same age? What could seeing her possibly mean if anything? Any help would be awesome guys, it's been bothering me the past few days.

Edit(June 20): So I asked a bunch of people on the street I live on, turns out its not connected to my family. It's the street. 

My 'neighbor' Brandon (I don't actually live here) saw her, and he said she was at the corner walking down by our houses and when he went to take a second look, she was gone. 

Down the street my great aunt said that she saw her WHEN THEY LIVED HERE. she was a grandmother. But my great aunt said that they kinda just weren't there anymore, they up&amp; left or disappeared. They were only living there for a moth. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,1371757691.0,,,True,t3_1gozp5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gozp5/native_american_spirits/,

I just want to share it with you guys because it creeped me out then (and it still creeps me out now) and you guys are obviously looking for a scare. Enjoy, I guess...?

When my aunt was a little girl, her and her uncle's family lived together under one roof. It was a modest two-story home, and they weren't really a lot, so it wasn't much of a bother. In fact, she enjoyed it because she got to hang out with her cousins and sisters in one room and bond with them until they'd all fall asleep.

Anyway, her uncle was working on their house constructions when he fell ill. Before he got sick, he had a nightly routine of counting the wooden planks in their garage where most of the equipment was kept. Next, he'd lock up the door and go up the stairs to the bedrooms to check each and every one of them if they were safe and sound asleep. My aunt even remembers waking up to him pulling up their blankets one night to make sure they were all comfy and bundled up from the cold. Then, he'd proceed to go to his room and sleep.

He died a month or two after he was diagnosed, accidentally overdosing on the medicine that was given to him. He was found dead on their couch with nothing but the medicine bottle on the side table. Nothing paranormal happened before the burial, but a few days after that, that's when my aunt and her sister heard someone counting the planks one night. 

Of course, they were spooked. No one they knew would be awake at the same time their uncle started his nightly routine, and the way the planks were being moved was familiar in a sense that that was exactly how their uncle would count the them. They knew what was coming next, and the moment they heard the lock and his footsteps on the stairs, they both hid under the blankets and pretended to sleep. No matter how much they remember their uncle being the kindest, most nicest man they knew, a ghost is still a ghost, something that isn't supposed to be on this earth anymore. 

When their door creaked open, the temperature of the room suddenly dropped and she could feel the goosebumps on her skin. She tried her best to fall asleep, but the notion of someone—or some*thing*—else was in the room with her, even if it was her uncle, still disturbed her more than she could imagine. She couldn't will herself out of the blanket, and instead laid still and waited for him to leave the room. She went on like that until she actually fell asleep.

That was the only time he ""visited"" them. The following nights after, nothing happened anymore, so they were speculating that he just came by to say his goodbyes. It's not much of a scare. It's sort of heartwarming actually.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1gg2q3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gg2q3/fam_my_aunts_uncles_visit/,

The front door opens into the living room/dining room, and about 20 feet to the left of the front door is a three-way intersection of doorways. The left is my parents' room, the right is my old room, and the doorway closest to the front door is the beginning of the hallway. The hallway has always made me uncomfortable. It makes me feel vulnerable, like I'm being chased down it. There is an old, oval mirror at the end of the hallway. When I was about 8, I was tall enough to see just my head in the mirror from the other end of the hallway. I was up early for school one morning, and I remember being especially scared of the hallway in the early-morning darkness. I remember a feeling of dread, or maybe overwhelming loneliness when I looked down the hallway, so I decided to turn on the light. When I did, I saw my head/face in the mirror, but it was as though I was old and mangled. I ran to the kitchen after only a moment, but I still remember seeing myself with skin a green/brown color and sags in my cheeks. Nothing similar has happened to me since, so I'm not sure if it had something to do with the house, the mirror, or maybe I should be in a straight jacket.

1365784664.0,20,self.Thetruthishere,1c7qlp,[ME] My Strangest Experience on a Strange Street in my Neighborhood,Darebirth,30,10,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1c7qlp/me_my_strangest_experience_on_a_strange_street_in/,"I moved into my current neighborhood about six years ago, a very large crowded urban neighborhood. About three years ago, I found this strange little back street; if you are not familiar with back streets, they are essentially really big alleyways, giving access to the backs of houses or businesses or garages rather than the entrances of residences. This street is about two blocks from my house, and it features some very strange sights. Very strange spraypainted pictures are visible at various points. One of the buildings up the street has a large barn door, and two of the houses have doors on the second floor which look like they should lead to a balcony that is not there. One of the buildings is four stories tall (a stark contrast to all of the surrounding two story buildings) and the top is littered with antennae and radio equipment; the door to the back of this building has a biohazard warning and a list of dangerous chemicals. If there is any interest in this, I will go to this street with a camera and take some pictures to put here. The point is that this street is a mess of odd art and somewhat suspicious behavior plopped into the middle of a fairly normal neighborhood, and I will often take walks up this street just to see if there is anything new going on.

One particular day, I had gotten out of school early and had to kill about two hours before my friend got out. It had snowed the day before, and while most of the sidewalks had been cleared of snow, the back street was entirely covered in fresh, untouched snow. I took a walk up the back street, putting the first set of footprints in the fresh snow. As I came to the first bend, I found a group of about 15 to 20 stood upright on the ground. These were very ornate vases, all of them unique, and they looked like they could have been worth a decent sum of money. I didn’t touch them but I took a couple of pictures with my old phone. I don’t use this phone anymore, but it might be laying around my room somewhere. Once again, if there is any interest, I’ll look into it. I had told my friend about the strange things up this street, but this was by far the strangest, as it seemed that they had been there for a couple of days, untouched and for no apparent reason. 

I wound up going to a gym that was around the corner for about an hour, just to kill some time, and eventually my friend got out of class. I excitedly told him that he needed to come to the back street to see these strange vases. He agreed, and I showed him the pictures as we walked over, explaining to him why the occurrence was so strange. We got to the back street and I noticed that my footprints were still in the snow from before. As we got to the first turn, I was shocked to find that all of the vases were no longer there. They had completely disappeared. I looked around to see that there were no tire tracks or new footprints other than the ones that I and my friend had made.

I am prepping for an event tomorrow and so I don't have time to walk to the street (it's raining right now anyway). I might go tomorrow. Also, I tried to find the pictures I took of the vases themselves, but I must have long ago destroyed that phone (I tend to go through cheap phone after cheap phone, and this happened like two or three years ago). What I can do now is put up some screen captures from Google Maps. Maybe tomorrow I will take a walk down there when there is nicer weather.

This first shot is of the barn door that I mentioned.

I am now overseas, in another country for study (university). So now I currently live in a condominium unit with my sister and her husband (I have another story this one too, but later if you guys are interested in reading).

Keep in mind, in my house back then, I never feel threatened, or spooked. I had few encounters with some things I couldn't really explain, and even heard some things but never really react much about it since they didn't appear often and usually disappeared in a blink of an eye.

Our house isn't that big, pretty modest, but enough to accommodate 4 of us (I only have 1 sibling, which is my older sister).

Here's the pic of the house [map](http://imgur.com/cpBHWAX).

The spaces between room to room are pretty small, in fact they're pretty connected to each other without doors, except for my parents' room and our room (I slept in the same room with my sister, we have this [pull out bed](http://www.sofaandhome.co.uk/images/shop/more/750x526_1290086031elliotstopover.jpg). She slept on the top bed while I slept on the lower one. We had a guava tree planted in our front yard before it got cut down when we renovated our house).

Onward to the stories.

1) Back then when I was on 2nd or 3rd grade, I often awaken late in the night. Every time I checked the clock, it was always around 3AM in the morning. Nothing happened really, sometimes my nose just got clogged and it made me hard to breathe, sometimes I'm awaken with no reason at all. One particular night, I'm awaken from my dreamless sleep. Everything was quiet, I could hear my sister slowly breathing on her bed. I was just staring at the ceiling for about 5 minutes before I heard ONE LOUD BANG on the window glass in front of our bed. Our windows are secured with [trellis](http://www.sofaandhome.co.uk/images/shop/more/750x526_1290086031elliotstopover.jpg) (similar like that) and  the bang caused the trellis to vibrate for like 5 seconds (it was that loud, though my parents claimed they didn't hear anything) Weird thing was, the noise wasn't caused by anything like a stone, but more to like something blunt and softer like a fist/tennis ball/fruit. I used to think it might be the fruit from our guava tree, but when I measured the distance, it was too far (like around 5-6 meters) from the window. And guava fruit isn't THAT light to be blown by a regular wind. It must've taken a very strong wind to blow the fruit and that night, like I said, everything was quiet. No wind, no animals sound, not even crickets. I was startled and hid under my blanket until I fell asleep. I didn't dare to open the curtain (my windows were double curtained) to check what ever that was. Years after that happened, I told my sister what happened. Apparently she heard the same thing that night. We apparently both frozen and just decided to sleep without telling each other until years later.

2) My sister and I were packing for our trip to the beach with my parents and their friends. There used to be a large oval mirror hanged on the wall in our living room. Below the mirror was a side table we used to put framed pictures and some decorations. That night she was putting in her clothes in the bag and when she lifted her head and faced the mirror, she saw a human figure all in black (which what we called ""shadow people"") was leaning on the side table, as if it's checking itself up in the mirror and gone in a blink of an eye. Apparently her friend saw the same figure sitting down on the dining chair.

3) My mum has a close female friend who is ""tuned"" to those kinds of things. She's able to ""see"" what most people couldn't see. One day, years after experience no. 1, she came to our house to hang out with my mum. Before she left, she told my mum that she saw a lady with long black hair and long white dress sitting on the branch of our guava tree. According to her, we need not to worry since she's harmless and didn't do anything but sitting there. To even think about it still gets me chills. &gt;_&gt;

4) In the map above I circled 2 TVs with red ink. One TV was in the living room, and worked just fine. The other one was in my parents' bedroom, which was totally busted. One day my sister was walking out from our bedroom and saw a white smoke floating above the TV in our living room, which was gone in a second after. She was in her early teenage years, which was around 13 or 14 and I was still 8 or 9 years old. A year after, my mum picked me up from school and we went through the front door which basically is the entrance to the living room. She went in first, and head straight to her room. I was still on the living room when I saw her turned on her bedroom light and I saw a white smoke floating from the broken TV. I pointed my finger to it and told my mum that there was a white smoke floating above the TV beside her. She turned her head to see, and the smoke's gone. Keep in mind, the TV's broken, and UNPLUGGED. I have no idea what caused the white smoke emerged from the TV itself.

5) Later in my high school years, (I was around 17, my sister already went overseas for university) so I basically went home in the afternoon. My mum went to the gym while my dad was still working. So I had the whole house to my self until around 8PM. My mum claimed she heard noises when she was alone in the house. Like the sound of someone flipping the light switch at the kitchen/2nd floor, on and off, creaking sound of the wardrobe door at the 2nd floor, and another switch noises at the backyard where our water pump is. When I was alone in the house I often heard things on the 2nd floor, the same creaking and light switch being flipped and other stuffs but my reaction was too nonchalant. I chose to ignored it so it stopped. So what? It was just noises, much better than actually seeing the real thing, right? &gt;.&lt;

I have to make it quick, because I'm at work. My best friend and I used to carpool from school. He took guitar lessons while I was in soccer practice and then I hung out at his house afterwards.  He and I used to always try to scare each other, but he swears this wasn't him this time. It was a school night and probably around eight at night.  We were hanging out in his driveway while our parents were talking inside. All of the sudden, from about ten feet away, we heard a sound that greatly resembled a child's laughter, but it was high pitched and it just felt wrong. Without a word, he and I made eye contacted and ran faster than ever, flinging his door open and almost hitting his mother in the face with the door. We both heard the same noise and neither of us could figure it out. After thinking, we assumed it must have been an animal, but I can't think of any animal that could possibly make that sound. He had no children in his neighborhood (mostly old people). This was in 9th grade. I'm 21 now and I still feel uneasy getting out of my car at night near those bushes. He claims to have seen weird, explainable things before. Seeing as there were explanations, he never really chalked them up to much, but he's seen shadows and heard noises. He's smelled weird smells in his kitchen before as well. I haven't heard anything crazy since then, but I will never forget that sound. The sound was about five feet from where his cat was buried, but the sound didn't seem cat-like. I wouldn't say that I believe in ghosts, but I don't dismiss the possibility.

I definitely consider myself sensitive. Mostly to future events, how people are feeling, and the deceased. 
In the fifth grade I was best friends with this girl Madison. We were inseparable. She went on a church retreat with her family to Colorado and I started to have strange dreams. One was specifically bothersome. I called her up the next day to tell her that on the third day of the retreat that she shouldn't sit too close to the edge because someone was going to fall out. She asked me how I knew she would be white water rafting that day and I just told her I had a dream about it. So, on the third day of the retreat, they go water rafting and lo and behold, their guide falls out of the raft. That was a very strange coincidence. 
As far as my connection with the deceased: recently, a friend of my younger sister's mom died so we went to visit him at his home after practice one night. I looked through the screen door of his home and just saw a woman sitting in a chair quietly. No one was interacting with her at all. She looked very ill and sad. The back of my head became warm (you know those rushes you get occasionally?) and I heard a very soothing voice tell me: I want him to know I love him and for him not to be sad.

 So a long time ago my grandfather bought a house for him, his wife, and two kids. They had no idea they were going to be rooming with someone from the other side for the rest of their lives... It mostly started with little things; Keys going missing, packages opening, items moving, nothing major. But after a while my grandmother realized this wasn't just misplacement and forgetting that they did it, it was something more, something unnatural. 

The day she found out it wasn't them it was a new roommate or at least one they didn't know was there until then. it was in what we call the front bedroom, now for some layout explanation. The front bedroom is all the way down a long hall at the front of the house, and it also is the only bedroom with attic access. 

 As I was saying, it started in the front bedroom. My grandmother bought new blinds for the bedroom and had placed the blinds still wrapped in cellophane on top of the rocking chair's back cushion. left the room to start a pot of coffee, came back and the blinds were opened and draped across the rocking chair. She had no explanation for it, she was the only one in the house, kids at school grandfather at work. She pondered what it could have been and then left the room to check on the coffee, when she got to the kitchen it seemed darker all the lights were on, but it was almost like by having so many lights on the power was being scattered across too many areas, dimming everything in the process. The coffee grounds were spilled across the table and a giant H was pressed into the center of the grounds. My grandma freaking out ran into the front bedroom and noticed the blinds were back in their packaging wrapped but now sitting on the floor. 

Later on they found out a lady had passed away in the front bedroom, her name was Hannah. Now a days my grandparents still live in the house and they have different things happen from time to time, mostly just missing objects that turn up weeks later in their respective spots again and my grandma likes to calls out to Hannah to stop messing with them, but they have learned to live with their new found friend and its kinda funny going over there to see things happen. Other occurrences have happened that could be freaky, but nothing has happened to make them feel like they are in danger, mostly just spooked out from time to time.

I'm always interested to see what people think about Out of Body Experiences, because while they have been proven in laboratory settings, they are still not quite fully understood and therefore still lurk in the realm of the paranormal. I should probably start by saying that I was not a normal child; some of my actions that I recall are inexplicable, even to myself, and so when I tell these stories from my childhood, you need to keep in mind that some of what I did was mere brain farting, to put it bluntly. I don't remember much of my childhood either - at least not specific instances. What I do remember about my childhood, however, is that I would regularly have Out of Body Experiences while doing non-threatening uninteresting events in my day-to-day life - playing video games, sitting in class, playing at home or with friends. I had these OOBEs so often that I did not think anything of them; they were a regular part of my life. I likened it to switching between first and third person views in a video game. I remember constantly thinking that I would be better at sports and such if I could see my entire body like a video game character rather than being in first-person view so often. I will recall for you a few instances of OOBEs that I recall very vividly, saving the best one for last, of course.

In school one day (4th grade), my teacher was collecting information for snack orders (we would bring in a montly fee for a daily snack which consisted of a pretzel and a juice of our choice). She would ask who wants whatever drink, and those kids would raise their hands. When she said ""Who wants the orange juice?"" my hand shot up. As I did this, I had the OOBE, and I was no longer seeing through my eyes; I could see myself as if I were looking from a foot in front of myself. I could see myself with my hand up and all of my classmates behind me, none of whom had their hands up (nobody else liked the orange juice; the cool drink to get was this iced tea that tasted like balls.) The OOBE lasted about five to seven seconds, and I kept my hand raised stiffly the entire time. People started looking at me strangely because I had my hand up way too long, and I finally snapped out of it and sat back in my seat.

I remember I would get OOBEs while playing video games often. I would get somewhat annoyed and have to pause the game, waiting for my vision to go back to normal so that I could resume playing. One particular time, I was playing a game with my older brother Rich, and I had an OOBE. We were sitting next to each other on the floor in front of the TV, and my vision was coming from about two or three feet behind us, looking at our backs. I paused the game to ask Rich to move over because he was in the way of the screen. I remember him being very confused and told me to unpause the game. I told him again to move over, and he got annoyed and told me to cut it out. After he said that, the OOBE ended. I remember being annoyed and saying ""Nevermind, it's regular,"" and unpausing the game. I find this story to be pretty funny. My family thinks that I am weird for many reasons, and I can only imagine how confused my brother must have been when this happened.

The best OOBE story I have, however, involves a situation that was potentially life-threatening. I had just got out of school (3rd grade maybe) and I was waiting at a corner. Our crossing guard was letting some cars go and so I was waiting to cross. There were these kids that I walked home with (I called them my friends at the time but they did not like me all that much, honestly), but they were already about a block ahead of me and I wanted to catch up with them. I decided to just run across the street. This big black car was turning and had to slam on its brakes to not hit me. As soon as I started running, I had the OOBE, and I was looking at the whole intersection from an aerial view, maybe two stories above me looking down. I saw myself running, the car stopping, and the crossing guard waving her arms nervously. I stopped for a second at the opposite corner as my vision went back to normal, and then I continued to run to catch up with my friends.

I have had hundreds of these experiences, but I don't remember much of my childhood and the experiences themselves were not that special to me since I had them all the time. Asking me to recall all of them would be like me asking you to recall every time you sat on your couch. You're only going to recall certain stories involving your couch, like the time you had sex on your couch or maybe that really awesome movie you watched. You wouldn't be able to recall every instance of you sitting on your couch, though. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the OOBEs that I do remember. I have no explanation for why I had them so frequently. I have not had an OOBE since I was in fifth grade. When I was in about sixth grade, I started researching about cryptozoology, ghosts, and other paranormal phenomenon, as it became a topic of interest for me for whatever reason. It was at this point that I realized that OOBEs were considered a paranormal phenomenon. After reading about them extensively, I came to the conclusion that this was what I had been experiencing during my childhood. I was surprised to learn that this was not considered normal.

I want to hear your guys stories involving OOBEs though. I might be able to answer some questions about them as well if you have any.",,False,,t5_2sntx,1360431094.0,,,True,t3_1876j4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1876j4/out_of_body_experiences_me/,

Since about 2006/2007 I've been feeling a weight in my shoulder or back. It kind of feels like a hand but without distinct fingers or a thumb, just a blob if you will. The only abnormal thing about this feeling is it only happens when I'm alone somewhere that people can't see. I've never been able to explain this is and it always leaves me puzzled. Half the time it leaves me with a headache too which makes it weirder.
Around the end of the first semester of 06/07 I was talking to a few friends about ghosts and the paranormal who claimed they have had experiences and to somewhat be knowledgful of the paranormal. That night, I was home alone for a couple days and I already knew there was a spirit in my house of the time. An older guy had passed away on the upstairs floor and would walk up and down the hall. It was nothing unusual, and never anything harmfu ever happened. But that night, I fell asleep on the couch and had woken up to being pulled off by the unseen, with hand marks on my side and I fell on the floor. I knew it couldn't have been the old man because I've fallen asleep on the couch many times before while being home alone. Also, I would go up the stairs which lead to the kitchen and right there is a widow. The house across from my backyard was an acre away and their window didn't line up with mine but whenever I would go up the stairs I would always feel somebody watching me even when someone else was in the kitchen. In that house I slept in the basement and my room was beside the driveway and all up 2 feet was underground. Through that wall, I would feel people tugging at my blanket and clothes and at the end of my bed that was against that wall, I would be able to feel people watching me but nobody was ever there. I've only told 3 people about this and one said the weight on my body and the feeling of being watched (both of which still happens even to this day) said it could be a guardian angel.
Even to this day, through 3 other houses, actually, while I was typing this, I felt that same weight or pressure on my shoulder and got a headache and I now live 8 hours away from where it started. Is there anything that could be causing this? Could it be a guardian angel?

Edit: I think I might have confused a few people and I need to clarify a thing or two. The tugging only followed me to a second house but it was only about a 10 minute drive between the two houses. After the second house, when I moved 8 hours away, it stopped. The weight pressure presence thing and feeling watched has followed me though. But if I do ever feel a tugging again, I will find myself a priest right away. I've heard stories of malovent beings and that stuff is scary.

1355188795.0,21,self.Thetruthishere,14mzjq,My [FAM]ily tends to stay close.,tophatduck,27,6,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/14mzjq/my_family_tends_to_stay_close/,"I may have posted this twice on Reddit already but I have decided to tell this story the way I learned about it.

For the sake of description both side of my family lived 800km from us in small mostly farming communities and my uncles were literally my grandparents neighbors. Like the title says they stayed close.

Everything started when I was 14. My grandfather passed away. He was a farmer until the end and people (and his animals) loved and respected him. His passing was not sudden and he spent several days at a hospital away from his home. My mother and her brothers where in the hospital for the end while my aunts where still at their home. After they recovered from the shock my uncle called his wife to tell her the news. She didn't sound surprised and asked if it happened an hour ago. ""How did you know?"" ""An hour ago your father's cows started mooing like crazy. I never heard them being so loud."" It sounded a bit crazy but I didn't think much about it.

A couple of weeks after that I came back home from school and I found my mom being pretty quiet. Turned out she was going through some of her father's old box full of letters and poems when suddenly the can of juice she put aside to thaw exploded. I thought she tried to be dramatic. We always thawed these cans and this never happened. But on the ceiling there was indeed little orange spots spread out. 

While we cleaned but the remaining of the mess she said that it happened has she was reading a pretty personal poem he wrote. ""It felt the same way as to when I dreamed of Grand."" Grand was my grandfather's mother and she stayed with them (my grandfather pretty much never moved out and took care of her since his own father was never present (passed away while sleeping while Grand was pregnant while my grandfather)). Again, family tends to stay close. One day Grand was gone to visit family but a couple of days later my mother said she dreamed of her coming into her room and telling good bye to her. The next morning the family learned that Grand has passed away. Now that the juice mess was done my mom asked me ""Have I ever told you about Uncle Eddy?""

When my mother was growing up no one lived in the house beside her house. But the family owned it and my grandfather was now using is as an extra tool shed for his farming and fishing equipment. A special note about this house was its color. While the other houses were plain white or brown this one was completely blue. One winter evening my parents were coming back from a date and my father noticed the blue house and asked if anyone lived in there. My mother said no but he pointed out that all of the lights, from attic to basement where on. My mom told her father and they rushed out to make sure no one was stealing or breaking his equipment. They went around the house and saw absolutely no footprints on the snow. Grandpa quickly gave up the search and said ""It's only Uncle Eddy."" Uncle Eddy was the previous owner of the house and, as you may guess, Uncle Eddy has passed away a long time ago at this point. And this what grandfather clearly knew about but for him and the rest of the family Edmond was still there and was not a threat.

Sorry if this story is long but I do not know how to make it shorter. But hang on as my favorite part is beginning.

Few years after my mother's oldest brother decided to move out into the blue house. They moved out the equipment but some things in the house cannot be physically moved. Now what else could a young man in his own place do but bring girls over. And so he did but they never stayed around him for long after going into his house. Little things were happened to them. Salt and pepper shakers would be at the unreachable top of the pantry, chairs would be moving during the night. One of them heard something in the middle of night and while inspected what it could be she found a man standing in the middle of the kitchen. She ran out immediately and all she could describe was that he was wearing a round hat. The same kind Edmond was fond of.

One night, while my uncle was single, something kept him from sleeping. A faint tugging. It was clear to him who was pulling on his blanket but he wasn't afraid. Only mildly annoyed. He asked it to stop but it only pulled stronger until my uncle reached for the light switch dangling above his head. Nothing was in his room. ""Fine! You want the bed tonight you can have it."" He left the room with the light on and went on the couch in the living room right under it. From the ventilation hole he could see the light. ""You have the bed to yourself now. Good night."" And the light went off.

As far as I know not much happened after that. I visited him a lot but I always had a weird feeling in there. I loved to explore at my grandmother and even go around the barn but this old, crumbling house always gave me this vibe and never did I wanted to sleep there.

Now we believe Edmond has finally left the house. We do not know if it was because my uncle found a good woman, had a daughter or because he won at the lottery and renovated the house but it definitively feels a lot more welcoming now.

Tho when he was planning to renovate the house everybody told him to remake the whole foundation since he could afford it. But he refused simple saying that something didn't want to let him change the house that much.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_14mzjq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/14mzjq/my_family_tends_to_stay_close/,

When I was about 9 and my sister was about 7 we shared bunk beds in our vacation house in New Jersey. One night I wake up to see a large figure standing next to the bed, at eye level since I was on top. There were no features but it was dark enough that light couldn't pass through. At first I just thought it was my dad but after a few minutes when I realized it wasn't I shut my eyes because I was scared and didn't open them again. To me it looked like a black form in the shape of a person, yet although there was enough light from the street lamps etc, I could not distinguish a face or anthing. I didn't talk to my sister about it, and the next morning I asked my parents if Dad had been in the room or if anyone else had been. They said no, he wasn't and noone else was either. (There was only one entrance to the house and we were on the 2nd floor of a split level so though an intruder is possible it's unlikely)

Not having heard my story, later my sister also asked them if anyone had been in the room. Apparently she saw the figure too, but she saw it sitting next to the window , staring at her. She said she watched it for a while and was so scared she started crying. We both saw it independently of each other, and my parents are not the type of people to trick us like that and they were the only other ones in the house. I don't remember what they said about it, probably just dismissed us as being kids. However we never saw it again, nothing else happened there, and we've since sold the house.

This other story happened in our (non-vacation) home in Pennsylvania. When I was about 12, my little sister was 10, and our best friend was 11, we spent most of the summer in our basement using the Ouija board. The person who would talk to us was a little girl who called herself Lele, she said she was 6 years old and from China. She told us some stuff we didn't know about previously, like my mom's miscarriage, and would talk about how she liked it when we had certain tv shows/lights on etc in the basement- very specific stuff. At first we all thought each other were faking it, but quickly realized noone was. She was very playful, like a 6 year old would be. We talked to her almost every day, and thought nothing of it. It was a fun game to us, and not something to be scared of. We knew that a Chinese family had lived in our house before, but didnt find out till later that they had a little girl and ended moving back to China- I have no idea if her name was Lele/if she died/how old she was etc. It got to a point where my sister and I could use it by ourselves (as in 1 person, not with each other). Eventually adolescence happened and we moved on to other activities, but I told my friends in high school about our experience and they witnessed for themselves one night that it was very easy to talk to ""Lele"" in my basement. My family still lives in the house, and a few other creepy things have happened there, but those are 2 of the main paranormal occurrences that I've experienced so far...",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_12rdtv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/12rdtv/me_fam_shadow_person_ouija_board_story/,

I was on my own at the local Park listening to my Music because I needed some time to myself, And I was feeling deep Emotion due to an injury which prevented me from continuing on with my Fitness. Seeing all of these other Joggers made me tear up because I have lost a majority of my Endurance and Physical strength, And seeing all these people Running made me feel Sick inside.

Incident:

Now as I was listening to a Song which I have listened to literally thousands of times, I noticed that the timing was off, In fact it was way slower that I had heard before I had left My House. Now I hail from a Family of Musicians and I know that my timing is impeccable, Furthermore I doubted that this is really happening or that I was just hallucinating, So I turned my Head left and right and to My surprise I experienced a lagged response, So this time I pushed my Body upwards as my hands were by my hips as I was sitting down and it took a solid two seconds to get a response. One last test. I looked at a  Jogger who was passing at the time and I could literally see His feet moving with water flicking off  Mm. By.  Freaking. Mm. 

However there was no lag in which I was instructing myself Mentally, I do feel that the intense Emotion that I felt is connected to this Incident somehow.

We both like creepy things, so I got us a night at a haunted bed and breakfast where a very famous murder occurred. When I called and made the reservations, none of the especially historically haunted rooms were available, but I thought it would still be interesting. 
There were a handful of other guests, I think maybe 11 or so other people. All nice people, but most of them thought they were personally taping for ghost-hunters. The next morning one of them even says she slept on the spot on the ground where they found one of the bodies.
I am a skeptic, at best. I'm an atheist and have a science background, while my bf is much more superstitious.
After a cheesy (but fun) seance, and chatter with the other guests, we settled in for the night. When we got to our room, we realized staying in an old home/inn means no cable, no tv. Luckily there was wifi, so we watched re-runs of the office on hulu. Nothing especially scary. 
I was tired so I drifted off and the boyfriend wasn't far behind. I am an extremely heavy sleeper, and I was really tired from the drive. We had stayed up late the night before (I threw him a surprise party )and I had to drive the whole way down since my bf doesn't drive stick. I am sound asleep when I feel a forceful POKE in the arch of my foot, which is uncovered by blankets. It felt very intentional, and at first I thought bf was trying to get my attention- or my cold feet off his legs. But I sat up and turned on the light, and he was completely out. 
Awhile later, I woke up to him standing in front of our door, just staring. He was awake, but he thought he had heard someone knocking. After both being freaked out, we finally fell back asleep.
He woke up again, because he thought I had gotten up to go to the bathroom, and was climbing back into bed. I wasn't. He insists he distinctly felt me climb into bed, and was surprised when he realized I was sleeping nearby. He woke me up to ask me if I had been up, which I hadn't, at this point, I realized I did need to use the bathroom, which was down the hall, so I made him wait outside for me. 
The next morning at breakfast, we were told that supposedly ghost children haunt our room, and you are supposed to bring them toys if you want to sleep through the night. No one else experienced anything paranormal or off. I'm not sure what I felt, but it was a very, very real sensation of someone poking me.

After Germany, we moved to far west Texas. Our off post house was a just perfect size two story, with two bedrooms upstairs, one downstairs, and a little area at the top of the stairs you could look over into the living room. This is relevant.

The first night we arrived in our new rental home, we all slept in the bedroom my daughter would have. It was a nice size room, with a little alcove built over the garage. We had air mattresses and a playpen for the little one.

I couldn't sleep, of course. The house was too empty and quiet. As I laid there, I listened to the cars driving down the busy street outside, and then I heard a man yell. But he wasn't outside. The sound echoed in the empty house from the living room area. Immediately following this sound, footsteps ran up the stairs right into the room we were in and a woman began to weep near my head.

Needless to say, I didn't sleep much that night, or the night after when I couldn't shake the feeling of something watching us from the doorway.

When our furniture arrived, it was a little better. The man didn't echo in the house anymore, and we all got settled into our respective rooms. The master bedroom was directly below my son's room, where he was safe in a crib.

About two weeks after we got our furniture, I woke at an ungodly hour to the sound of tiny footsteps running back and forth and my son laughing. The steps would bang near the window as though someone had jumped and then run to the other side of the room and bang there, too. I had to get up and check in case the kiddo needed a bottle or change, and as soon as I stepped foot on the stairs, the steps stopped. My son went quiet, and by the time I'd gotten up there he was fast asleep, like he'd never been awake at all.

I didn't get up when the footsteps started anymore.

My husband left for his third deployment about four months after we moved, and one evening I was sitting on the couch in the living room watching House. A movement caught my eye, and I looked up to see my blonde haired daughter staring at me through the banister. When I got up to go tuck her back in, she turned around and ran to her room. But Ashleigh was still tucked in exactly where I'd left her, and was fast asleep. That was the first time I saw Emily from Germany.

A few months later, my mom came down to stay for awhile since my husband didn't like us alone there, especially with the escalating drug war right across the border. Juarez was a thirty minute drive from our house. One evening, we were sitting there, watching tv, when the bathroom light came on upstairs. My son had gotten in the habit of climbing from his new toddler bed and spreading shampoo all over the bathroom. Mom saw a kid his height go into the bathroom, so I went up to see what was going on.

Again, my kid was in bed, albeit halfway off, but fast asleep. The bathroom was empty, the light was on, and I hightailed it back downstairs. Peyton and Ashleigh shared a room at that time since my mom was there, but he didn't sleep well in there. He would wake up crying every night, pointing to a corner in the playroom. I finally had to move him and Ashleigh into his old room and my mom took their spot for a few months.

A few days later, I found a child's drawing on my dining room table. It was of the house, a man and woman, and a small boy, and it was signed Marcus. Other things happened in the house. I'd smell cologne when my husband had been gone for thirteen months. The cats wouldn't go into the upstairs bathroom, period. The dog unearthed small bones by a creepy statue in the backyard, and after she did that I saw a cat hanging around the house that didn't belong to me. It would leap from the couch and run down the hall under my bed while I sat at my computer and watched. Freaking Pet Cemetery up in there, I swear.

I never tried to contact these things, because I was afraid they'd say something I didn't want to hear. Emily showed herself a few other times. I'd be sitting there, and see Ashleigh come in from the corner of my eye, but she'd be in an entirely different area of the house when I called her. Something sat on my bed one night. The mattress shifted and a butt print could be seen on the covers.

We lived in that house for four and a half years. After the four years of hauntings in Germany, I didn't know how much more I could take. When I saw a man crouched in the corner of my garage one night when I went to do laundry, I about lost it. The doors were closed, had been all day, and there he was, behind the car.

My husband got out of the army after his fourth deployment and we moved back to Ohio. Sorry for the length of this one. I've never sat down and written this out because it freaks me out to remember. I'll make one more post tonight about why I think something followed us to Ohio. Thanks for reading!

Their details about this story never changed, and the first time I heard it from each of them, it was without the other person present.
We'll call this guy Dave. Dave had been in the US Navy for four years, then decided not to re-enlist. He had rented a place in north east of San Diego, out sort of in the sticks and desert. His brother, we'll call him Derek, would go down and visit for a week or so at a time. They had some very odd experiences while Dave lived there, but this was one of the most frightening and bizarre.
Dave and Derek were hanging out with their older brother and another one of Dave's buddies, I want to think the buddy was also Navy. They decided it might be fun to go spend the weekend in Tijuana, Mexico. The oldest offers to drive, so Dave and Derek start drinking a little early. Now, both of them are ""experienced"" drinkers. I've watched Dave go through several shots of Absinthe and some mixers in less than an hour and still be talking coherently. According to what he claims, he was buzzed this night, but not wasted.
It was around dusk when they saw traffic slowing down. I 'm not clear on what was going on and I don't think they are either. They said cars were stopping and things were backed up, I believe it might have been a police stop where they look for drunk drivers, but I might be guessing.

For whatever the reason was, they pulled over and got out. I think they were planning on a short stop. The problem was, Dave suddenly started acting odd. Again, by his own admission, he had been drinking, but he claims he was only starting to feel it.

Derek says that as they got out, they were looking at the desert. If you have never been to the TJ border, picture sandy hills covered in scrub brush, scraggly cacti, occasional Joshua trees, and rocks, but mostly just the light brown sand. Dave walked down a hill, I think to answer the call of nature, and Derek and the other two guys lost sight of him. They waited a few moments, called to him, no response. So they all walk down there and he is further away than they thought. Derek said he had a weird look in his eyes. They called to him to get back in the truck, but he just grinned evilly and said ""No, let's play!"" He immediately took off.

At first they thought it was a joke and told him it wasn't funny, etc. Again, there are a ton of low hills in the area with a lot of dry ""channels"" between them, where the water flows when it rains, so as Dave is running around, they keep feeling like they've caught up to him, only to get around the bend and see him further ahead than they thought possible. The whole time, they keep calling to him to ""get back in the damn truck,"" and he only responded with a bizarre laugh or told them to catch him if they could.

After about 20-30 min of this, Derek and the other guys have lost sight of Dave. The sun is almost down and it is getting dark, so they're starting to panic. They split up, but before long the oldest brother yells out. Derek and the friend run over and were not prepared for what they saw.

Dave was lying down, arms rigidly tucked at his sides, staring straight up with wide eyes. Derek said the expression on Dave's face was ""the most creepy-ass grin I've ever seen."" He said it seemed unnaturally large. Dave wasn't making a sound.

Then Derek noticed Dave wasn't lying on the ground. His neck was arched slightly, his entire body suspended between two boulders with the crown of his head on one and the heels of his feet on the other. His spine was perfectly straight. When Derek was telling me about this, it reminded me of the old parlour game, ""light as a feather, stiff as a board."" His body literally looked like it was made of wood with the way he was suspended.

As you can imagine, they all get freaked out by this. One runs up a hill to locate the truck, the oldest brother grabs Dave and throws him over his shoulders in a Fireman's Carry. They start booking it back to the highway. When they got near the truck, almost there, the brother felt a shove from behind but kept going. As they got to their vehicle, Dave suddenly begins moaning and talking normally again.

That is Derek's version. Dave's is similar, but when he first walked down the hill by the highway to relieve himself, he remembers doing it, but then everything gets fuzzy. The next thing he remembers is looking up and noticing that the sky has changed colors. It is a strange shade of red, but evenly lit like it was glowing itself. He looked around and could see dark creatures, looking like they were made of shadows, staring and snarling at him from on top of one long hill. There were also shadows like people scattered around, and he could feel hate coming from them.

He then saw his body and was confused. It was suspended between the two boulders, and Derek and his brother were trying to wake him up. Then he recalls seeing his brother walking quickly with his body, and he follows. Suddenly, his head looks up at him, his own eyes glowing red, and it smirks. It didn't say anything, just gave him a smug look like ""what are you going to do now?"" 

This made Dave pretty upset. Coming from the military, when it comes to ""fight or flight,"" he'll chose fight every time. He said he wasn't sure what he was doing, but he was mad, really mad, so he ""jumped"" at his body. The dark entity, whatever it was, fought back. He kept mentally cussing at it, calling it names and commanding it to ""get the hell out of [his] body!"" As they got close to the truck, he finally gave it one big push. The creature popped out, growling at him, as his ethereal body re-merged with his physical body.

Then he was on the ground, confused, disoriented, trying to make sense of what just happened. They turned around and went home, and he didn't drink for a while after that.

So that's it, that's the story. **TL;DNR:** Friend and his brother stop in the desert, his brother starts acting weird and runs off, they find him balanced between two rock. From his end something dark possessed his body and he had to fight it to get back in.

I'll try to answer what questions I can. I'll ask ""Derek"" if I can't recall (I don't talk to Dave anymore). My thought is that whatever it was was tied to the land somehow, which is why he suddenly won when they got him to the truck, and why it didn't require a formal exorcism. I think part of it stuck with him though. I knew him growing up and he was always a punk but now to put it in D&amp;D terms, he's Chaotic Evil. That's why I don't associate with him anymore.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_xzkri,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/xzkri/possessed_by_the_dark_fr/,

I posted here a few months ago about a rail that tipped back and forth on it's own in front of 2 volunteers and myself. Since then, nothing much of interest has occurred in the shop except the occasional feeling of being watched and one incident where I heard a voice inquire 'hello?' only to find noone around to voice it.


What I am about to tell you has a possible human error explaination which I'm very aware of, but I wanted to share this with you anyway as it triggered genuine fear in me and, as much as I would prefer the human error explaination, I can't shake the feeling that it's something bigger than that.


I approached the shop this morning to find the back door unlocked and ajar by about 6 inches. My first thought was burglars, but as I pushed the door open, I saw that the catch on the Yale lock was down and that the door couldn't latch because of it. I realised then that the weekend team hadn't locked up properly and had left the shop open to intruders. 


I wasn't sure whether I should call the police and not enter just incase but decided to go in anyway. It was creepy and my heart was pounding. I walked around the shop turning on the lights and looking in every hiding place. It was horrible! Satisfied that there was nobody hiding in the shop, I stood in the back room with my hands on my hips thinking about how freaked out I was. Suddenly, the strip light directly above my head zapped out. It was so cold. I left the shop to get coffee and chill the heck out before anyone else arrived as I was a bit twitchy.


Fast forward a few hours and I'm on the phone to the lady who was in charge over the weekend. I tell her about the door and she swears blind that her and another volunteer had double checked the doors before leaving. That wasn't a huge problem for me as there are a few other people with keys who may have been to the shop on Sunday. It must have been one of them. I stand in the back room, chatting to this volunteer on the phone for about 5 minutes.


I put the phone down to go onto the shop floor to help with a customer inquiry. The customer tells me she may have left something in the shop over the weekend and I head into the backroom to look for it for her. As I walk into the back room, I'm stopped dead in my tracks. The back door is ajar about six inches and the latch on the Yale is down. It was so cold in there that I could feel it in my bones. All the hairs on my body stood up and I could feel goosebumps on my legs. I had only left for about 30 seconds, if that. I sheepishly went outside to catch whoever was misusing their key, but as expected, there was nobody on the back street at all.


Now, it may have been that the weekend people left the door open and can't remember and that I then went and did the same thing but this has never happened before. Needless to say, I double checked the door tonight.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_xetzq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/xetzq/charity_shop_rail_tipping_update/,
1341992442.0,20,self.Thetruthishere,wdj3m,[ME] The Basement Black Mass,venusinfurzz,27,7,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/wdj3m/me_the_basement_black_mass/,"Hey guys.  I've been lurking around this subreddit for a while now, and decided to post one of my own experiences.  Bear with me, as this is the first time I have written a post of my own.


This experience happened several years ago.  A bit of background:  I was probably about 20-21, and still living with my parents (yes, so cool, I know).  The reason I was still living with my parents was because I had had a serious drug problem for a solid couple of years of that time.  I mention this because I believe it could be relevant to what I saw.  Anyways, I was dating this guy Dan that had addiction issues like I do (also, I mention this only because I think it might be related).  However, we had both been clean in the months leading up to this night.

So, back to the story.  So, like I said, Dan and I had both kicked our habits for the time being and were clean and attempting to begin normal lives.  However, in the days leading up to the night in question, things were starting to slip again.  You know, a slip here, a slip there, but generally we were keeping it together.  So, the day this happened, we had both finally fallen and relapsed together.  This was pretty early in the day, if my memory serves me correctly, and trust me - I was into the drug I was into for a looong time, and I assure you that I wasn't just trippin' out or something.  If any of you guys have been in the same position, you know what I mean by that.  Anyways, tangents, sorry!  Okay.  So.  Dan and I had both finally fucked up.  We were like, ""oh, whatever, no big deal"" and went about our day.  Around 6pm we went to dinner.  Upon arriving home, Dan didn't feel very well and went down to the basement to lay down and watch some TV.  I stayed upstairs, talking to my mom, and then decided to take down some leftovers and hang with Dan.  This is when I saw something I will never, ever forget.  
Carrying an armful of plates and to-go containers, I set to walk down the stairs to the basement.  I take a step or two down the flight when I see a large, tall, black shadow in the doorway to the basement.  I said something like, ""Hey, Dan, can you help me with these?"" obviously thinking it must be him.  I don't know how to explain it - the shadow had no discernible features - but I could *feel* it watching me.  I just knew.  I stared it down and took one more step down the stairs.  I called out ""Hey!"" to no response.  I just kept staring at it as it kept staring at me.  Finally, I said, ""...Dan?  Hello...?""  But it had already begun to sink it that whatever I was looking at was not my boyfriend.  I blinked and blinked, this was no trick of the light or my imagination.  I stared at this thing head-on for at least 30 seconds.  Then, suddenly, it just...glided out of view.  ""Glided"" is the only was to describe it, just a left-to-right *glide*.  Still wanting to think it was Dan, I ran down the the stairs, only to find Dan laying comfortably on the couch watching something on the TV.  I remember saying, ""Why did you ignore me?""  to which he just kinda stared blankly and was like, ""uhh, what?""  I then gave him the rundown on what I had just seen.  It became very clear that it had certainly not been him.  He had been on that couch since we'd gotten home.
Needless to say, I was terrified to sleep that night.  I don't tell people this story much.  I am a logical person (doesn't everyone say that?) but *I know what I saw*.  
The reason I mentioned the drug shit is because I've always wondered if the Black Mass is some kind of, like, dark being that people in bad spots in life draw to them.  I've heard more than a few stories from others who describe the EXACT same thing, to a T.  The night I saw the Mass was the first day of a relapse that would essentially send me spiraling into about 4 more years of addiction hell.  That's why I wonder, that's why I think about perhaps it was something dark that Dan and I had unintentionally ""let in.""

Of course, we joked about it, but really, what makes hooved footprints other than a horse or cow? But there would be no reason for a horse or cow to be where I live. And these footprints were too big to be some small animal that ran in a specific pattern to create hoof-like footprints.

 Still one of the scariest things I've seen simply because of the fact the footprints led from the tree through a BRICK WALL and were hooved. Aren't demons associated with hooved prints? Yeah...

When I was about 8 my family and I moved into a new house. My mom grew up about 10 houses down from our new house and had heard stories about this one in particular because of a little girl that had been killed in front of it by a car. Anyway, since we had just moved in, we didn't have any curtains up over the bedroom windows. 

One night I woke up in the middle of the night sometime after midnight. I went to the bathroom and came back to my room, which was shared with my little brother, who was 3 at the time. We slept in bunkbeds, him on top in a twin and me on the bottom on a full sized bed. I climbed up and checked on him, he was out cold. Then I decided to go look out our window, which overlooked the back yard.

I didn't see anything as I walked to the window, just blackness since it was so late at night. Then, just as I got to the window and really looked out of it, I saw something. I couldn't really tell what it was at first, but after a second of looking at it, I saw a face. Not a human face. It was round, almost a perfect circle, but was torn down the middle. There was an eye on either side, also perfectly round. The face itself was white, like a sheet of paper, but the eyes flashed different colors, mostly white, red and black. This...thing...had a mouth, also on both sides of the face, but it was more like a gash. It was hanging open, but twisted upwards, kind of like a smile and bright red. 

The two halves of the face tapered closer together the lower on the face you looked and were joined just under the circle by a rope. It was braided just like a normal rope. This thing is very hard to describe, but if you want me to I can draw a picture and post that later after my son goes to bed.

It just stared at me for a minute or so before it terrified me so much I ran screaming from my room and into my parents bed. My mom still remembers me blubbering about this thing. Does anyone have any clue what it could have been? Or to try to debunk it? I have been wondering for years what this could have been. This was also my first experience in that house, but have a few more as well as other things that happened at other houses, though I never saw another thing like this.

They moved to a slightly bigger house around 1961. Around this time, her parents semi-adopted a neighbor boy whom needed some guidance. My mother had 6 brothers and a sister, so at night, the girls would sleep in the room with the parents, and the 7 boys all slept in the living room. 

The layout of the house is important. There was a small living room with a very large window (with no glass, i don't think.) The window showed the small front yard, a little fence, and then the street. 

Cleanliness is VERY important in Indian culture. Every morning, the ""adopted"" son woke up with dirty feet. My grandmother scolded him for sleeping with filth, yet every morning, he'd wake up with dirty feet. 

One day, the family decided to visit a bustling shopping area of a nearby city. The neighbor boy seemed unimpressed and didn't want to go. ""Why not?"" everyone asked ""You've never been to the city!""

He looked at them, dead serious, and said ""Yes I have. Every night, I see different locations. I've even seen Switzerland and New York.""

The boys laughed and laughed and made fun of him, but my grandmother was concerned. ""What does it look like?"" 

The weird thing was, he could explain everything in great detail, like he'd actually been to these places. Keep in mind this was rural India in the 60s and the boy was failing school. After telling stories night after night as all the kids listened in amazement, he let something slip,""And my girlfriend shows me all of these places!""

My grandmother asked him to describe his girlfriend. ""Oh she's positively lovely. Her complexion is very fare. She wears a beautiful white sari and always has the most fragrant jasmine in her hair. She comes here every night and takes me on an adventure.""

My grandmother was scared. She had the boy wash his feet and inspected the cleanliness. She woke up very early the next morning and saw him with dirty feet. She immediately placed crosses by every window and door in the house. 

The next night, she made him clean his feet again and again inspected the cleanliness. She also gave him a beautiful cross necklace. The next morning, his feet were clean.

My mom woke up and went to get water from the kitchen, and there she saw a girl, her mouth open in a rictus. She stood just beyond the fence. She demanded they take off the crosses from the entrances. My mom ran back to her parent's room crying. 

My grandmother told the neighbors about this woman, and the neighbors seemed unsurprised. ""That must be Samhita. Her husband murdered her years ago for being too independent and pretty. We call your house ""the murder house"" and you aren't the first people to see her and move.""

I was asleep in bed with my girlfriend when I woke up suddenly late in the night, which is pretty unusual for me as I'm a rather heavy sleeper. After the initial couple of seconds of confusion and getting my bearings, I've come to the uneasy conclusion that something must've woken me up. I sit up and briefly scan the room, freezing when I notice what isn't right.
Outside the window, where I expect to see nothing but moonlit illuminated sky, there is a small object hovering there outlined against aforementioned expected sky. I'm frozen for a few seconds, going through the usual logical ""I'm dreaming"" and ""My eyes are adjusting"" explanations. After I've come to the uneasy conclusion I'm very much awake and not seeing things, I make a rather rapid beeline to the window to get a better look. 
The object was dark grey or black in colour and I would estimate the object was about the size and shape of a frying pan, expect about double the height and with very squared off edges. It was hovering silently and motionlessly, almost as if suspended, about 10 meters up in the air and about only a couple or so meters away from my window. It did not react to me at all and continued to stay where it was for at least a minute before floating very very slowly to my left along the row of houses. 
I followed it for as long as I could, but it eventually went out of my view.

Mainly all when I was a child. I'll start with the earliest.


When I was about 4 or 5 years old, I would often times hear voices when I was in a very quiet room. I remember playing barbies by myself on the floor in my room when I clearly heard my best friend voice say my name. This happened to me a few times. We still have a very close bond. 

There was another time when I was playing by myself and I heard what sounded like a very deep and scary male voice say something. I couldn't make out any words, but I knew it didn't sound nice.

There were also times when I would hear a very nice, soft womanly voice. I also couldn't make out any words, but I remember feeling very calm when I heard that voice. These voices were not a common thing for me to hear and I know it was not my imagination or any type mental illness. I have never heard anything since.


8 years old. I was getting ready for school with my mom. I completely blacked out and went blind while standing in my kitchen. I think it happened because of a drop in my blood pressure, but it lasted for about 4 minutes. My mom walked me over to the couch and I was feeling really scared. I put my head below my knees and eventually I was starting to see again. I looked at my mom, and standing next to her was a figure. It was outlined in what I can only describe as a neon light. I saw it for about 5 seconds and it dissappeared.


10 years old. I was sleeping at my friends house on the floor in her living room. Mind you, I do not and never have had night terrors/sleep paralysis/ or any of the like. I woke up because the TV was still on. I rolled to my side and was facing a huge window. Outside of the window was nothing but woods and pitch black, standing there (outside)was an extremely large figure completely draped in white. I couldn't make out any features but I could tell it was looking in. The only way I can describe it was very ""soft"" looking. It actually looks like that famous picture that is in almost every old paranormal book. The black and white picture of the white ghostly figure walking down old victorian stairs. I was so scared, the only thing I could do was turn onto my stomach, shut my eyes, and pull the covers up over my head. I told my friend about it the next morning and she told me it was probably just her dog. HA!

Has anybody ever experienced anything like this? Any input? I've always tried to rationalize, but all these things have stuck with me..

I'm going to try to explain them here.

I'm a young adult male, and I live at home while studying for a major in finance.

Around July 27 or so of this year, I spent the night at my friend's house and came home in the early afternoon. When I got home, I went upstairs to my room to drop off my stuff. I'm a very religious person (traditionalist Catholic), so I have a lot of religious stuff in my room. Hanging on my wall  across the room from my bed are a couple icons, a large picture of Michaelangelo's Pieta, a couple crucifixes, some rosaries, and a prayer book. When I opened my door, I saw all of this stuff laying on my bed. It was a little odd, but I figured my parents had been doing a bit of maintenance work on the walls and stuff. Except when I came closer to put them back up, I saw that they had all been horribly defaced. Have you seen The Exorcist? That scene near the beginning where the statue of Mary in the local church was defiled? It was a lot like that. Disgusing, blasphemous things were drawn all over the icons and pictures, and there were disturbing symbols drawn all over everything. On my two crucifixes, the corpus (image of the body) had somehow been turned uptside down, and it looked like the transept had been melted or something.
I don't know what all the drawings were done with. Paint, maybe. It was dark red, like blood, and had texture to it as far as I could tell.
I asked my parents and brothers if anyone had been into my room, and they all told me that nobody had. I wouldn't tell them what was wrong, but I brought them upstairs and showed them, and they were all fairly shaken. They were worried that we had been broken into, but there was nothing taken from anyone, and no signs of forced entry anywhere.
This absolutely terrified me. I thought about taking pictures, but ultimately I decided that I didn't want any evidence of this remaining because of the blasphemous nature of what was written and drawn. I took all of it outside and burned it. Real shame too, because over a few years I've spent a fair bit of money to accumulate my devotional items, but there was no way to get that stuff off.

After that day I kept a journal in my room, and I decided to write about anything that happened from then on. Like I said, I'm quite religious, so I wasn't about to fool around with something like this.
The rest of my post is going to be formatted like this: the date and my journal entry will be inside square brackets [ ], and my commentary will follow. This stuff is ongoing, so I may be able to update more later.

Nothing happened for a few days.

[July 31: dark figure in the painting]
I have a painting hanging near the head of my bed, on the wall perpendicular to where the devotional things used to be. It's a winter scene of a country road, with an embankment going up towards a wire fence on the left, and the road extending up and to the right a bit, from the perspective of someone standing on the road. I came into my room on the afternoon of the 31st and happened to notice that the painting looked different. I looked closer and saw that there was a gaunt, very dark figure near the horizon standing on the road. I know for sure he hadn't been there before; that painting has been in the house for as long as I've been alive, and in my room for at least five. The figure didn't seem to be doing anything, but it looked like he was surrounded with shadows (despite being in the middle of an open road with no lighting around him). I left my room and didn't come back until very late when I absolutely had to sleep, around 3am, and the figure wasn't there anymore.

[August 3: woke up, all drawers and closet doors open]
Pretty self-explanatory. I woke up around 8:30 to go to work and found all of the drawers of my dresser, and the doors of my closet open. I always make a point to close my closet doors before bed, because it sort of creeps me out if they're left open. Always has. The drawers are never left open if I'm not using them. It's possible I did this myself while sleepwalking, because I've gotten out of bed before and done silly things like pull off my quilt, but never anything quite like this.

[August 6: dark figure back, closer]
Same as the first time, I came in sometime in the afternoon and the dark figure was there again. He was closer this time. Close enough that I should have been able to make out a few details, but I couldn't. He wasn't blurry or anything... I just couldn't focus on what I was seeing in the painting. Even now, all I can remember is that it was a gaunt black figure. I couldn't even look at it for longer than about ten seconds, because my peripheral vision would start to blur. I took the picture down and put it in a closet in the hallway outside my room. I couldn't look at the picture as I was taking it down; I had to stay behind it and only touch the frame. Something felt really really wrong with it.

I started having trouble sleeping at this point. I haven't had trouble falling asleep since I was about 7, so this was very strange. When I did finally fall asleep I would have nightmares all night, but I can't remember them as soon as I wake up. All I know is that they were very cold and dark.

[August 10: chair moved]
I woke up on the morning of the 10th and my chair was in the middle of my room, facing my bed. As if it there had been someone in my chair looking at me. I have two chairs in my room: an older wooden folding chair that is often out, because I sit on it to play guitar, and a large office chair that sits behind my desk. It was the office chair that had been moved to the middle of my room. It's not easy to get that thing around my desk, so I'm not sure I could have done it myself while sleepwalking. I wouldn't have had the coordination.

[August 15: walls turned black]
This one was the strangest thing to happen up to this point. It had been quiet for a few days, so I had just started to let myself hope that maybe it was over. I was working at my desk writing down ideas for a new blog post, about 3 in the afternoon, windows open and it was nice and bright. Then something *shifted*. I don't know how else to describe it. It's like the whole room moved down and to the left just a few inches. My vision shifted with it, and the walls were a deep, deep black. Same with the door. There was black light coming through the window behind me. This lasted for about five seconds, and then everything shifted back. I thought I heard an echo when it shifted back, but it wasn't an echo of a sound. It was like when you see someone laughing to hard that no sound is coming out, but I was 'hearing' an echo of that. Sorry if that doesn't make sense; it's as well as I can explain it.

[August 16: computer won't work in my room]
This was the day after the walls changed on me. I found that my laptop wouldn't even turn on if I was in my room. I was carrying it from the main floor into my room, and the second I crossed the threshold of the door, it just went black. I fiddled with it for about an hour, but it would only work when I wasn't in my room. This is still the case as I'm typing now, although there are a couple notable exceptions that I'll describe later on.

[August 18: Calling priest today. ______ help us.]
I tried to wrote ""God help us"" here, but my pen wouldn't write it. It was like it ran out of ink when I tried to write God. Nothing else.
I had been telling my parents about most of what had been going on, and they attributed it to a few bumps in the night, and my imagination getting the better of me. They're not as religious as I am, and so they didn't quite understand how disturbing the symbolism so far was for me. Anyway, they agreed to let me call my priest thinking that it would make me feel better.
So I called my priest a few minutes later. This priest belongs to the Fraternal Society of St. Peter, which is a traditionalist society within the Catholic Church. They celebrate Mass using the older form, the pre-1969 form, as well as the other sacraments and blessings in the older form. This guy doesn't mess around, like me. After I told him the story he agreed to come by the very next day to see what he could do to help.

[August 19: priest came, lost time, maybe hallucinating]
The priest came over at two, and we talked about what had been happening, and he explained what he was going to do. He had with him the Rituale Romanum (Roman Ritual), which gives instructions on specific blessings, including exorcisms and prayers for houses. His was the older version again, which a lot of exorcists believe is much more effective than the revised version. You can't exorcise a house or object, only people, but there is a prayer in the Rituale that works sort of like an exorcism, to drive out demons, from an object or place. Father told me that this was what he was going to do today, and we would see if it helped. I also had confession with him before we started, because it's good to go into these things with a clear conscience. 
He started the blessings at 3pm. In some circumstances we consider this a powerful time to do something like this, because 3pm is traditionally regarded as the time that Christ died on the cross, thereby conquering death and evil, so we would attempt to do likewise. I was instructed to pray silently while the priest said the public prayers. There were a few responses that I was meant to make as well. He had a small briefcase with him that had holy water, a crucifix, and a stole. Kind of a priest's emergency ammunition bag.
Anyway, it was very strange in my room as soon as he started praying. My vision seemed to go fuzzy. Not blurry, just sort of soft. I wasn't perceiving colours correctly either- everything seemed kind of washed out, like a very subtle greyscale. I lost a lot of time at this point, nearly an hour. I don't know if I made the proper responses or not in this time. I wasn't unconscious, because I still vaguely remember being present, but I wasn't fully there. I saw faces looking out at me from shadows in my room. They would move and disappear when Father sprinkled holy water or made the sign of the cross, but they would always come back in a different dark corner.
These were cute little imp-demon faces. These were dark and terrifying. They were grinning evilly, but they also looked like they were in horrifying pain. They couldn't stay still; they were always twisting and contorting. I don't know if they were saying anything or not. Their mouths moved, but I didn't hear anything. I did feel their voices though. Right in the pit of my stomach.
I don't know if there were hundreds during that hour, or just one. I do know that Father didn't see the faces, but he told me that he did feel something very wrong in my room. He left just after 4, and asked me to call him in a couple days with an update.

Nothing happened for about a week. I called Father three days later, August 22, and again on the 27th, and we hoped that maybe the blessing was all that was needed.

[August 29: computer turned on in the night. He left a message.]
My hope was shattered at 3am in the morning of August 29th. I woke up to see the glow from my computer screen at my desk. I hadn't even been keeping my computer in my room anymore since it stopped working in there, but there it was on my desk. I went over to look and saw the Mac program TextEdit up on my screen (notepad for Macs). Over and over again, all it said was ""not that easy"". Different capitalizations and spacing, but written thousands of times on the page. Not That Easy. nothateasy NOT-THAT-EASY!. The computer shut off as soon as I touched it to see if any other programs were running.

[August 29: woke up, park was dead like in the winter. Called priest again.]
This happened when I woke up that same day. There is a small public park behind our house which I have a clear view of from my window. The first thing I do every morning is open my blinds, and when I did that on the 29th everything in the park was dead and grey, like it was the middle of winter. Keep in mind, this is the hottest portion of the summer, and everything is normally green and bright, especially by 9 in the morning. This time though, the sky was dark and grey, like there was no sun. It should have been right in my eyes; my window faces east. The trees and grass were a dull, dead grey. There were no leaves anywhere, on the trees or on the ground. Weirdest of all, the pine trees had no needles either. All the trees were like centuries old skeletons turning to dust. It looked like wrinkled grey hands coming out of the ground, beckoning towards me. I looked out my window for a good 60 seconds wondering if it was a trick of the light, or my eyes, but it didn't change. Then I broke eye contact and ran down to the main floor, looking out a window almost directly below mine, and everything was the way it was supposed to be.
I didn't waste any time, I called the same priest up and gave him the updates. Same as last time, he agreed to come over the next day, same time.


You're probably wondering why I kept sleeping in my room. I thought about leaving a few times. It was awful, every time I walked into my room I had this sense of foreboding. However, when I thought about maybe sleeping on a couch or even in a different house, I had this absolutely petrifying dread. Somehow I *knew* that if I left my room, he was going to follow me. For now he seemed to be stuck in my room, but I knew in my gut that if I stopped coming back, he was going to come out and find me. Maybe take over the rest of my house. I wasn't exactly thinking 100% rationally at this point, but I just had this complete revulsion to letting him out of my room. 

[August 30: priest came, more hallucinating. Voice yelling.]
This one was largely the same as the first time he came, although maybe more intense this time, and my hallucinations were different. The same washed out colouring happened right away, but this time the entire time Father spoke, all I heard was a low grumbling, maybe a growl. It filled my ears, and it was intense enough that I was sure it should be shaking the entire room, but it wasn't. I lost even more time, in fact I don't even remember Father leaving. I came to laying on my bed. I wasn't even surprised that I was there when I came to, though looking back on it even an hour later it's fairly disturbing.
As I lay there starting to become aware again, I started to hear this awful yelling. He was screaming in my ear, over and over again, but I couldn't move yet. I still wasn't fully aware. I don't know what language he was yelling in, or if it even was a language. I can't even remember what it sounded like, but it felt like it was ripping my soul in half. I don't know how long it lasted, but it was 5:30pm when I left my room. I was dazed.

My parents realized that something was very wrong at this point, although they were worried it was a mental illness. I had some tests done over the next few weeks that I won't bother detailing, because they didn't find anything and nothing unusual happened with regards to the tests themselves. Nothing abnormal in the brain scans, or at the psychiatric appointments, or that the psychologist could tell. All this crap kept happening over that time.


I can't bring myself to write more at the moment. Will do so soon though, and go over everything that happened during September and October.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_l7jtc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/l7jtc/my_experiences_since_this_summer/,
1318239263.0,22,self.Thetruthishere,l6wwb,Nurse,Kemica,27,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/l6wwb/nurse/,"I have just stumbled upon this subreddit for the first time today, and it is giving me the motivation I need to be able to talk about an experience that happened to me when I was a child. 

Sorry for the huge wall of text, but typing many details is helping me remember things I have been trying not to remember for a long time.

At the risk of sounding cliche, I consider myself to be mostly a skeptic. I believe in the possibility of paranormal things, especially considering some of the things I have experienced. But, I also believe that a lot of stories you hear or read are probably either fabrications, or something that the teller has worked themselves into believing. I say this not to be judgemental, but to emphasize the fact that I still can't explain what happened to me, other than to say that it still absolutely terrifies me to even think of it. I believe that either something truly paranormal was going on, or that some outside influence or severe night terrors/sleep paralysis was effecting me. 

However, these events only happened in one house. A weird house.

The house I lived in when I was 5 till about 12 was a pretty weird one. It was originally a fairly old small building, with a loft bedroom above the main area. At some point a group of hippies added on to the building. The additions were not very well built or insulated, and were full of these big crazy glass windows and stained glass panels. There was a floating interior balcony area above the kitchen, and a tiny loft room we called, ""the hole in the wall"" which was just off the kitchen up a ladder. There was no plumbing in the house other than an old hand pump at the sink. The house was weird but I don't really know if it had much to do with what happened there. I almost think it was more something to do with the land it was on. My mother still firmly believes in Ley lines, and that the property was on a bad one, a really bad one. Many other people who have lived on the property (including the lady who lives there now, who is a family friend), has admitted having weird experiences there. However I am here to tell *my* story.
(I might be able to scan some pictures of the house if I can find them.)

My childhood bedroom in this house was in the older part of the building, it was up a really steep staircase which was kind of weird in itself, it was part bookshelf, and part window. There were two windows in the stairs, one between two of the steps, and one along the side of the stairwell. These windows came out of a workshop/washing room which was directly below my room. My room wasn't terribly weird other than being a very narrow attic room with a kind of slanted A shape to it, and a weird stained glass window over the main window (which was also the fire exit, via a rope and long drop).
The room below it though I never liked, and the woman who lives there now keeps both my old room, and that workroom padlocked. No small feat as my room didn't actually have a door. She has it boarded up now. I was actually relieved when I saw that because I wasn't sure she'd believe my story. I never told her all of it, but I did tell her to please not use those rooms. She told me to not worry, that she doesn't for her own reasons. They scare her too.
Anyways, the workroom was creepy by itself. It was full of old woodworker's tools. I'm talking 18th century stuff. There was this enormous old drill press, and tons of these thin little sawblades hanging all over the walls. The smaller side room in there had these huge rusty white ceramic sinks... I am realizing typing this that this house really is pretty damn creepy. I never liked it but in retrospect I am amazed I never really thought of it this way.
So yeah, very creepy all around.

A lot of the details here, I had been keeping buried really deep. About 8 years ago, something I was talking to my mother about in her new home triggered a flood of memories about this time of my life. I went white (according to my mother), fell to my knees off of the couch, and started crying and wailing. I am not prone to hysterics. I was covering my eyes and freaking out, saying, ""No, no, oh god... how did I forget this?"" or something to that effect. I scared the hell out of my mother.

This is what I remembered.

When things really started getting weird, I was about 7 years old. I've always had trouble sleeping. I wake up really easily. A housefly can wake me. I never had an imaginary friend, but I had some*thing* that would visit me just as I was falling asleep.

It started fairly gently. Just a weird voice telling me to, ""Go to sleep"". I will never forget the sound of the voice though. It sounded neither male or female, and like it was really far away, but right in my ear at the same time. Like a radio station with white noise and static, but a clear quiet voice that you could clearly understand.

I remember not really liking the voice, and wondering why it was bothering me. But I didn't fear it at first. I didn't trust it either though.
I don't remember how long this went on, but I remember the voice getting more interested in me, it would tell me to close my eyes, to just listen to it, and every night, to just trust it. ""You can trust me. I'm your friend."" I never spoke to it, but I did think to it, I know I was always thinking, ""No."" or at least negative.
It got progressively insistent, wanting me to trust it. Never, ever angry though. It seemed to want to convince me that it was my friend. It was this that ultimately made me the most afraid of it. I remember thinking *at* it, ""Who are you?"" and it's reply was, ""You can call me Nurse."" I guess it thought that would be a name I would trust. But I remember it scaring the crap out of me. 
I don't remember the details but sometime after this, when I knew for sure I did not like this voice talking to me* at all*, it started to get angry.
I would be wide awake but unable to move. My eyes would be, or at least feel open but I couldn't see. I would want to scream for my parents (which I sometimes did when I had a bad nightmare) but I couldn't. The worst part was, the next morning. I wouldn't remember a thing. I would only remember just as I was falling asleep. Then the fear would come, and the voice.

During this time I also had some of the most vivid nightmares of my life. Things no 7 year old girl should ever, ever, even know about. They were often the same nightmare over and over on different nights too. One I remember very clearly was this hardpan desert area that was covered in glass phonebooths. Every 10 or so feet, a phonebooth. In every one would be the same man in a business suit, and he was always horribly mutilated and massacred in different ways in each booth.

Another weird event that happened in that time, but I am not sure if it is related was, waking up in the middle of the night and sitting bolt upright. I don't know if it was sleepwalking but I vaguely remember. 

Mostly I have the details second hand from my mother, who got a pretty big scare. Anyways, I went downstairs and into that workroom I mentioned earler. Below the staircase was a storage area underneath a drafting desk that was built into the underside of the stairs. There were several random boxes of my parent's stuff, like records etc. stored there. I pulled the boxes out and started digging through them in the dark. 
I grabbed an item, took it downstairs into the kitchen, and promptly began screaming my head off. I was yelling, ""BURN IT!"" over and over at the top of my lungs. My parents flew downstairs and understandably wanted to know what the heck was going on.
The item I had pulled out was a Ouija board. I didn't even know what they were, or that my mother owned one.

The previous family who lived in the house had two teenage daughters who had played with Ouija boards in the house, and had some pretty bad things happen to them. The girls are technically the owners of the property now (and they're in their 40s now I think?), as far as I know they won't step foot there.

So, that's my rather long winded story. This is the first time I have ever written it down. I am shaking and terribly uncomfortable. I submit this in good faith, hoping that even if people don't believe me, that they won't think I'm nuts either. I truly believe every bit of this, but I do also believe it is possible that I was having night terrors, or just a hard mental stage in my childhood. 
But, I have more belief that something very frightening happened to me in that house.

I would appreciate any insight to my story, and if anyone has ever experienced anything similar, I would like to hear their story.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_l6wwb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/l6wwb/nurse/,

To give a bit of background to this story, where I live backs onto the Pilliga Forest. My dad has lived around this area all his life, and used to be a stockman/drover for a long time, etc. This is one of his stories he's told me.

Dad was off looking for some cattle for one of his clients, he was on his old stock-horse Duke, the thing about Duke (yes, named after THE Duke) was that absolutely nothing scared him, he was all heart, he used to knock over bulls, and trample wild pigs for fun. So, Dad was going down Bohena looking for water holes, following the theory that the cattle would have found their way there, when all of a sudden, Duke stops dead in his tracks, Dad assumes Duke is just being stubborn, so tries to urge him forward. Duke blatantly refuses to move, flaring his nostrils, and bouncing around in distress. Dad started to get nervous, all of sudden, he breathed in, and was hit by an acrid smell, to quote ""I'd never smelled anything like it before. It was f**king sick."" He lightly tapped Duke on the neck with the reins, and Duke spun around and took off like he was in the Kentucky Derby, in the opposite direction.

Not the best story, but it's true, and certainly shows there's something weird out there.

I'll update this as I find out more from people in town, etc. Cheers.

Update: Was out at a party tonight, had a few drinks, got talking about the pilliga. Was told there's an abandoned haunted house out the way, haha, as happens with a few drinks my memory is a bit clouded, anyway, the -something or other- triangle, I think.",,False,,t5_2sntx,True,,,True,t3_kw86z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kw86z/the_pilliga_fam/,
1317208247.0,21,self.Thetruthishere,ktz83,I'm part of a ghost hunting team: Here are my experiences -- Pt II,darkangelle,21,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ktz83/im_part_of_a_ghost_hunting_team_here_are_my/,"**[This was my first post.](http://redd.it/ksqqn)**  
*I am splitting these up because they are different experiences and dates and it becomes way too much to read in one sitting.*  
  
.  
This experience was at a nearby old and long-abandoned sugarcane central. Here is a [Google Maps link to it](http://g.co/maps/e22be).  

It had many buildings that were part of it's ""unit"" and they're slightly scattered about from it. We went into the Central first and then headed on over to the hospital. While at the Central, a few of us recalled feeling footsteps behind us at all times. On this main chunk of area, there was a large adjacent house. We weren't able to head into it because of asbestos, which was a real let-down because it seemed promising. The house appears in my pictures and there are *a lot* of anomalies on each picture of this house. There's not much we can do about it since we aren't allowed inside unless we're basically wearing Hazmat suits...  
.  
  
On this night, it was a large group. I estimate about 14 people.  
At around 1:30am, most of the group called it a night and went on their long way home. There were only 5 of us left. We decided to stay behind and explore the old Hospital. Here is a [Google Maps link to it](http://g.co/maps/6nmvf).  

As our group headed inside, it was very apparent that the place had, at some point, burned. It was badly burnt and it still smelt like soot and ashes.  
It is a very small hospital, with a strange layout. We *think* there's 3 floors, but once you're in it, it becomes confusing. One of the floors is underground.  
The most striking feature of the hospital is how completely trashed it is. There were abandoned tires, couches, *shoes* strewn about...  
The entire mood of this place was close to something you might see and experience only in Silent Hill.  
Not really knowing where to start, we cautiously walked through a small hallway that lead us into a square room with stairs leading up and 2 other hallways, one of which was obstructed with a couch, tires and burnt wood.  
.  

We all came to a halt in the middle of this room and took in the ambient. It was completely unnerving, even to the ""Seasoned Pro's"".  
We were just standing around, not daring to move when we began to hear a very soft, feminine voice. We all froze and listened intently.  
It seemed to come from 2 directions: The hallway we had just come from and/or the hallway with the stairs. The voice was very soft and quiet, but definitely female. It seemed to speak in urgency but we couldn't make out a single word.  
At this moment, we took out EMF meter (measures electromagnetic fields) and set it on the floor. We formed a circle around it and watched intently as our group leader began to ask questions out loud.  
The meter began to blink with high EMF readings almost immediately.  
We stopped for a second to verify that all our cellphones were off and we picked the EMF and moved it around each and every person in the circle to verify that none of us were giving off a charge. None of us made it blink whatsoever. We set it down and continued to ask questions. As we kept hearing her voice, the EMF kept blinking wildly. Then, I felt it. It was like fire. The soles of my shoes felt like they were burning up and the heat was traveling up my legs. I mentioned it out loud that I felt on fire and the rest of the group agreed and mentioned their feet felt extremely hot. The sensation lasted for a few minutes while we all stood around. At this point, 2 of our members called out that they felt they were being touched, more *specifically* stroked. As we stood around completely still, we could see the pant leg of one of them *move*. The zipper on his jeans had a small chain attached to it and it began to swing back and forth. Then suddenly, it all stopped. The voice completely faded and the meter stopped blinking.  
.  

Figuring she was moving through the building, we gathered our meter and went back to exploring. I mentioned that I felt the voice was coming from the hallway we arrived through, and we walked back down the hallway, hoping to find the source of the voice.  
We reached a few doors and walked through but there was nothing. The rooms were empty, soot covered holes in this sad building.  
We walked back and decided to move upstairs this time to keep verifying.  

As we were climbing the stairs, there was a startled gasp from a guy in our group. He began to ascend the stairs quicker and reached the top, flashing his light frantically in all directions.  
Most of us in the back asked out loud: *""What's wrong!?""*  
His answer: *""I just saw a nurse. A fucking nurse!""*  
As soon as he said that, our leader replied: *""She had a wide-brimmed hat, didn't she?""*  
Our colleague went pale and nodded while the leader replied: *""I saw her, too.""*  
At this point we were all getting goosebumps at random intervals and we felt a shift in the atmosphere.  
As we all stepped off the staircase and into the large hallway, we realized this ""top floor"" was what was outwardly the 1st floor. We had reached the main part of the building, which had the main entrance.  
.  
 
To our right, we had the main entrance. To the left, we had a long hallway that was broken only by the rooms it lead into.  
All of these rooms where falling apart. There was debris everywhere. Burnt debris.  
We walked towards our left and down the hallway and we reached the operating rooms. There were 2 operating rooms: Major and Minor.  
Everything in these rooms was completely destroyed. It was completely trashed, rusted and burnt.  
We began to hear things moving and the distant voice again, so we took the EMF out and set it on the floor again to ask it some more questions.  
Once again, with each question asked, it would blink. We were somehow communicating with *something*, we just could not understand it. We began to record on a digital recorder, in hopes that the voice could be heard after some audio tweaking at home.  
After a few answers, the voice disappeared again.  
  
Our colleagues kept seeing this nurse from the corner of their eyes, but couldn't find her whatsoever. We took many pictures, in hopes of capturing something, anything. Most of them turned up without anything, but I've only gotten to see my own pictures.  
I have yet to see the groups pictures, or heard their audio, even though I was told they were able to pick up something.  
After the voice stopped, we did a search through the area and we couldn't find anything else and the voice was no longer heard. The EMF never blinked again and at 3am, we called it a night and went on our way home.  
.  

I'd like to go again to this place and do a more through search with more equipment because I'm almost sure we had *something* there.

One day my grandparents sent my dad downstairs to the spare bedroom to make sure his uncle was up in time for his new job, and my dad found him unresponsive, wrapped up in the sheets on the floor next to the bed. Turns out he had a heart attack in the night and died while they were all sleeping. 

A couple months later, some family from my grandmother's side are visiting and hanging out in the basement and one of the younger kids (5 or 6 years old) wanders off by herself into the spare bedroom. Suddenly she starts screaming bloody murder so everyone rushes in to see what's wrong. The girl is pointing to the corner of the room where my dad found his uncle screaming ""There's a man! There's a man!"" No one else sees anything, and the girls insists for a while that there is a big, bearded man lying on the floor of the room until they look under the bed and in the closet, reassure her there's no one there, and take her out and calm her down. My father's uncle was a big, bearded man.

My dad tells this story all the time, to new friends whenever talk turns to the supernatural or unexplained or just to the family when he gets a few drinks in him.

I apologize for the shitty writing and grammar but I haven't had any sleep due to this page being so amazingly creepy. After lurking around this website for the past week I've finally decided to contribute too. The earliest experience I had was when I was about 7 or 8. It was already dark outside and I was laying in my bed reading a book. You know how you always read about how the room temperature changes or you get a weird vibe when you are about to see a ghost? Yeah, did not happen for me. I was reading the book and for some reason I decide to turn and look at my right side. I guess I must have seen something out of the corner of my eye, because right on queue this blond girl in blue overalls just walks down my rooms and disappears. My first reaction was to haul ass to the kitchen where my mom was at.

There was also some activity in my parents room too. One of my sisters would come visit and my niece would sleep with my parents. She would wake up in the middle of the night and start bawling, whenever they asked her what was wrong, she would simply point at the closet. Of course they couldn’t see anything, but she always started freaking out and had to leave some sort of light on for her. It was also in this room where another of my nieces suffered a seizure or was possessed... I remember I woke up to the sounds of someone screaming their head off, the lights in my room and in the hall were on. The screams where indistinguishable, I didn't understand any of it. So I walk to my parents room and they is my niece, twitching and acting like if she had gone insane, blabbering what to me was just incoherence. I remember my brother slapping her, trying to get her to snap out of it. Finally they decided to call the ambulance and they gave my niece a sedative. After that incident, nothing like that happened.

Fast forwards a couple of years, I was already in high school. Me and my friends used to go to my house to play some Halo or some King of Fighters. These actually didn't happen to me, but did to my friends. I remember I went to the kitchen to get some soda while my friends Sergio and Art where playing. I come back and the game is paused, I asked him what the hell was up. Apparently they saw some girls face outside my window just staring at them, I asked them what she looked like and their description fit what I had seen. Another time my friend Arturo was playing KOF while I was in the kitchen or in the bathroom. He was sitting on my bed and while he was playing the apparition of the girl appeared right next to him. Of course my friends where shaken, so was I.

But this one has always stuck to me. It's Christmas '06 and for some reason me and my nephews and brother in law are talking about creepy shit. I tell the story of the first time I saw the girl and my nephews jaw drops. Apparently, he saw her too. Back when I was a kid I used to share the room with my nephews, we had two sets of bunk beds to accommodate all of us. He was sleeping on the bottom bed and woke up for some reason. My bed was right above his to the right, so he could see me laying there sleeping, he looked up to where I was and sees the girl in blue overalls sitting right next to me. Being a kid he didn't think much of it and went back to sleep. His description was exactly like mine. I know none of these stories are terrifying but what left me awestruck was when he said she was reading a book for me.

Increased ""paranormal"" activity, a higher frequency of such occurrences, and a higher awareness in people that generally have zero experience with such things.  In addition to this, friends that I have made via various means in other states than my own have been reporting similar situations as well.

Over the past few days alone, I've seen shadow forms that pass between me and a light source, the light source being a high-up street lamp. Meaning no one should've been able to walk in front of it and cast a shadow to begin with (The shadow was humanoid, and there are no tree limbs between where I stood and the light). I've seen glowing eyes, more than once, only to look again and there be nothing. Felt something akin to static electricity when walking into places I know to be haunted, literally making the hair on my arms and neck stand on end... then go back to the same place the next day and the effect be gone.

The most prominent thing thus far, however, happened last night as I was getting ready for bed. A month or so ago our central air unit bit the dust, and my 7 year old son has been sleeping in the bed with my wife as we put a window unit in our room. I sleep on the couch, where the other window unit is, because my son tends to flip, flop, and flail in his sleep and I got tired of being beat half to death.

Anyway. I went through and turned all the lights out in the house except for the kitchen light, as is our habit (so kiddo can see to get to the bathroom if he has to get up in the middle of the night), locked the doors, and lay down on the couch.  I hadn't even managed to really get comfortable enough to try and go to sleep yet, but had my eyes closed as I tried to find the most comfortable position.  After a few minutes or so of this, I had the odd feeling of something else being in the room with me. I cracked open an eye and looked in the direction of the front door and.... There was a face hovering there in the air. Semi-animalistic, and quite definitely straining to manifest (I keep my house heavily warded inside and out).  In all honesty, it had a face similar to one of those gargoyles you see on a really old church. The eyes glowed, as it seems everything else's does, but were bright, almost prismatic.  After a few seconds of me watching it, it just faded away. Once it had faded, I just rolled over and eventually went to sleep. Weird dreams ensued, but that's normal for me.

So. Has anyone else noticed an increase in such things? Paranormal accounts and so on? Personal experiences? Or is it just me and my friends?

I was fairly weary about posting any of my stories on r/nosleep because I know many people do not actually believe in the paranormal. Usually it is because they have never experienced anything for their selves, yet. It’s not that I have a problem with people being rational and trying to find a logical explanation for occurrences, but sometimes there isn’t one. At least, through my experiences that is what I have come to terms with. Be it a ghost, demon, angel, or some other force or energy, something has to be responsible for these happenings. Through, I have never come across anything malevolent as far as I am aware. 

I have been living in the same house for some fifteen years and have been experiencing things since the year I have moved here.  My first experience happened when I was either 5 or 6. My mother use to run a daycare center from my home because she thought it would be the best way to work and raise her children. It was a sunny July day that was as normal as the rest. The daycare kids were playing until lunch at noon, and then would go play outside for about a half hour before a daily nap. It was right after lunch and my mother was gathering the kids up to go outside and I needed to answer the call of nature. I went upstairs to my bathroom, which is located right up the top of the stairs. While up there I could hear that everyone else had exited the house and were in the yard playing, since the back door makes a loud bang and shakes the upstairs floor when closed. I finished my business and opened the door and began my descent down the stairs. 

The stairs are against the wall on the right and there is a little bit of a banister to the left that closes off the hall from the stairwell. The hallway was always very eerie to me. It’s very tight and usually dark unless it was midday.  I always got the feeling that someone was at the end of the hallway watching me, and I still do. So, I begin walking down the stairs until I hit about the third stair and something caught my eye to my left. Directly across from me was my room at the time and coming down the hallway was a shadow of a man. He was approximately 6’4’’ because he was almost as tall as the doorway he passed. He was very tall, skinny, and bald from what I remember. He walked so slowly down the hallway toward me. At first I thought it was a family member and it was their shadow and they followed it. So, being young and knowing nothing better I began to call to it. “Mom? … Dad?” No answer, just a steady, slow movement.  I was so confused, so I leaned over and looked down the hall and saw no one was behind the shadow. I looked at it in horror and it got still closer to me and was now directly across from me, meaning that it passed the open door to my room and it didn’t cast onto the other wall or floor, like a shadow normally would. At this point, I freaked out and ran down the stairs and out the door as fast as my tiny legs would take me to find everyone present in the back yard. 

This whole experience of mine lasted maybe a minute but it felt like much longer. I remember frantically telling my mother and she told me that it was probably just a shadow of someone walking past the house.  Even as a 5 or 6 year old I could deduct that that wasn’t possible. The only windows upstairs in that area were in my room and my parents’ room. Their room was all the way at the end of the hallway. If it were indeed a shadow from an outside source it wouldn’t have went all along the hallway in the manner it did. How would a shadow get onto the second story from outside? Besides, it was noon and the shadow should be cast almost below you.

To make matters even worse, the shadow appeared again two days later. This time, however, it was at the top of the stairwell. I was downstairs with my brother who was maybe 4 at the time.  I called his attention to it and he acknowledged its presence. I went to the base of the stairs looking up at it and thought it was probably just my dad upstairs. So, I call to it again. “Dad? … Mom?” This time I got a response from the kitchen. “What T?” I was scared as all and they came looked up at it and said it was a shadow of a life size Barbie doll I had. I remember that doll. It was all of three feet and was missing an arm and a leg. This shadow had all its limbs and was again well over six feet. 

I know that my parents were just trying to calm me down as a child. Give some rhyme or reason to something we really had no explanation for. This is just the first of the many instances that were going to take place in here. This had to be one of the most frightening experiences that has ever happened to me, and one of the most visual. More bizarre stuff has yet to occur though. However, I am going to get into that another time.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_j06ph,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/j06ph/why_i_dont_like_hallways/,

He also said every morning he could smell burnt toast (at the time he was living alone) and he wasn't cooking any toast. He said he looked everywhere checked everything when suddenly he felt a hand touch his shoulder and at that point he went back to bed.

On to my experience. Around 4am the following morning I heard really strong childish laughter outside I also heard scuffling inside our room, but my brothers were alseep and my sister was on the couch, freaked out I went back to sleep. 
Lunch time I was wandering around outside when my dad stopped me and pointed to the top floor window that he was looking at... There was a lady in there (the landowner was single) she looked around then at us and vanished.

Me, AP, and Mark, and Mike we're all hanging out at his house one night during our high school years. Feeling adventurous on a beautiful night we decided to go for a walk around the forest (AP opted to stay back). 

Mark, Mike and I get to talking on our stroll through the woods and after some time we stop suddenly because it feels like we're walking on sand. This terrain was an abrupt change from the dirt and wet grass we had been walking over. We poke around a bit and come to the conclusion that we must be in a tilled garden of some kind.

Seemingly as soon as we realize this we see a light appear in the distance above us as though on a hill. It's square and framed like its coming out of a window. I kill my flashlight and we begin to get creeped out because we might be trespassing or something. While watching the window light we see clear as day a man walk passed the window hurriedly. 

The light turns off suddenly and I begin freaking out a little. Mark drops to ground and starts yelling at us to do the same in case he is looking out the window for us. Mike follows suit but in my panic-stricken state I begin thinking ""motion sensors"" or something alerted him to our presence and I begin running back in full sprint with the flashlight in tow. 

I hear Mark yelling at me to stop moving and that just makes the panic worse. After what seemed like forever I see AP's house in the distance and luckily AP was outside smoking so I sprint up to him and tell him we might have been seen on somebody's property. 
I told him about what happened and he reassured me that nobody lived this far back in the woods. (I had been around the property with him enough to know this but at the time I definitely saw a lit-up window).

 We watched through the window in his house for a few minutes and sure enough Mike and Mark come busting through the woods back to us.

The really creepy shit is that we retraced our steps as best we could in the daylight and we found the ""garden"" patch, footprints and everything in tact but all around it was nothing but forest.

That run through the woods has been the worst experience of my life.

Which may or may not be a good thing I suppose. But it's good to share and I always get goosebumps recalling the story.

I am now 26, but the events that unfolded remain forever burned into my memory as if it happened yesterday. Myself and my father had decided to make a weekend hunting trip to my familys hunting cabin. The cabin is located on a 120 acre plot of land in the middle of mark twain national forest. We loaded up on friday morning and made the drive out to the cabin. It is extremely isolated. Closest house is roughly 10 miles away. The cabin sits in a clearing and is surrounded by fairly dense forest on all sides. We arrived at the cabin around noon or so and brought everything into the cabin and gassed up the electric generator and got it hooked up and then decided it would be a good time to figure out where we wanted to set up our deer blind and a stand we had brought along. I decided I would go find a good spot for the blind and my dad decided he would go set up the stand in a different area of the woods. I followed down a small game trail through the woods for quite a ways and found a good spot, spent a little time setting it up and securing it so that it would be ready to hop into first thing in the morning. As I was finishing up I became very aware that something was watching me from the tree line about 25 yards away. At first it was just that uneasy feeling. Hairs on the back of my neck standing up, catching glipses of movement . I saw something peek out from behind a tree and then duck back, then I heard a loud crashing sound as it ran off in the oposite direction. It freaked me out at first, but being that I didnt get a good look, I eventually convinced myself it was a deer or some other wild animal. I returned to the cabin and related the story to my dad and we both laughed about it. We made some dinner, bullshitted a little and settled down and went to sleep about 9 pm. Around 1:30 or so we awoke to a loud crashing sound. It sounded like someone had thrown a large rock onto the roof of the cabin. We both got up, sat and listened for a few minutes and heard nothing but the errie stillness of the night occasionally interrupted by the howl of the wind outside. After a few minutes we got up and armed ourselves, my dad grabbed a spot light and we walked outside and shined it around a bit. We saw nothing. We eventually shrugged it off as a tree branch or some such and went back to sleep. We got up around 5, I went to the deer blind and my dad went to the stand he had setup. I stayed until around 8am without any incident. That evening I decided I would go to the deer stand and my father wanted to try out the blind. We explained to each other where we had setup and headed off. My dad had set the stand up on the edge of a small field next to a stream about a 20 minutes walk away. I opted to leave the 4 wheeler as I didnt want to scare any potential game in the area. I eventually found the stand and climbed up and settled in. I had been sitting for a while and hadnt seen anything other than a few rabbits and tons of squirrels. The sun was starting to set and I was about ready to hit the trail back to the cabin before the dark set in. The sun was far enough down that the woods were semi dark and eerie, making odd silhouettes at the shadows edge. As I was contemplating climbing down I heard a rustle coming from the brush to my right. I looked over hoping for a big buck, but immediatly froze in fear. Standing no more than 25 feet from me was a HUGE upright creature,covered in reddish brown hair, staring right at me. Its face looked so human, but this was no human. It had an odor like old coffee grounds or garbage or some such. It was roughly 7 feet tall or more. Huge and massive. I cant even emphasize enough on the size of this thing. It could have ripped me to shreds without even breaking a sweat. The deer stand was about 9 feet up and it could have walked up and yanked me out of it. I was terrified. It turned and walked off into some thick brush and I lost sight of it. I took my chance and hopped out of the stand and made haste back towards the cabin. As I was walking I was completely freaked out and scared to death. My heart was beating so hard I could feel it in my head. I was starting to calm down a bit as I thought it had went off in another direction when I heard a limb break, not too very far behind me off the path in the brush, at the shadows edge. Then I heard some more rustle. It was following me. I started to run and I heard it keep pace with me, just out of sight in the darkness of the woods. I was really regretting not bringing the 4 wheeler. I heard it getting closer, paniced and against my better judgement and a decision I would immediately regret, I turned and fired a shot in the direction of the noise thinking maybe I could scare it. It started screaming. Loudly and unlike anything I have ever heard. It made my heart skip10 beats. I just turned and started sprinting as fast as I could. It was screaming and it sounded like it was knocking down trees as it was coming after me. I heard it come out and cross the trail and go into the woods on the other side of the trail, still gaining on me, screaming and wailing horribly the whole time. I never turned around to look. It sounded like this thing was close enough to grab me and I was certain that it would catch up to me and rip me to shreds before I ever reached the cabin. My heart was pounding out of my chest, complete and utter panic and terror set in. Then I heard the sound of the 4 wheeler. I kept running, this thing is behind me screaming and wailing the most awful noise i have ever heard and bashing through the woods, Im still full sprint and i can hear the 4 wheeler at top gear heading in my direction. Just as i was certain this thing was going to grab me my dad appears on the 4 wheeler, he looked just as freaked out as me. I jumped on the 4 wheeler and he hauled ass back to the cabin, the whole time I could still hear it screaming behind us. I didnt look back. By the time we got to the cabin, it had calmed down and the screaming had stopped. We quickly gathered our things, opted to leave the stand and blind and hauled ass out of there. On the way home my dad told me as he was approaching me on the trail, he saw the creature on the trail maybe 20 paces behind me chasing after me. When it saw him on the 4 wheeler it ducked off into the tree line. I believe if my dad hadnt shown up, I wouldnt be here typing this story. We talked about it a little on the way home and then never spoke of it again. This is the first time since that I have spoken of it to anyone. It was the most terrifying experience of my life. I can still hear it wailing and screaming and it sends shivers down my spine.

A man, older, assuming he's deceased with a name of ""Ted... Theodore.""

He mentioned Montana, specifically Billings.  He wanted me to reach out to a 'Ryan.'

NOTES:  Regarding past occurrences; My mother once shared a crippling dream with me one morning about a co-worker who she feared was dead and found out after showing to work that he was in fact at the hospital in critical condition, I had a conversation with a co-worker who had recently passed who told me to tell her boyfriend (a commercial pilot) ""Not to go to Denver.""  and I have a daughter who frequently and vividly sees apparitions throughout my house which are less a game to her and more terribly frightening.

EDIT:  He did tell me something which I'd consider somewhat specific as far as a physical feature for Ryan.  He also mentioned some additional interesting items to pass on to Ryan but I want to hear from this dude before I share.  I'm hoping this could get interesting.

I tried to dismiss it as nothing but weird things kept happening.

It all started about a month or two ago, when my mom woke me up, startled. It was 3 am and I was asleep.

""Why were you in my bathroom punching the door?""

""I wasn't, I was asleep.""

""Don't lie to me.""

""I won't. I'm not.""

She was frightened. She told me she woke up by the sound of someone walking in to her room (the masters) and punching the bathroom door, openiing and closing it, flicking the lights. Keep in mind that our house is 3 story, my bedroom is on the thirs story and the masters in on the second.

A month later, my baby brother screamed saying there was a black figure/man walking upstairs. My dad got a knife and searched the house. Nothing.

About three weeks ago, I was reading a story on nosleep. This had me jumpy of course. I heard the sound similar to nails scratching wood on the right corner of my room. I looked. Nothing.

Again, there was a noise. This happened three times. The third time, when I was turning my head to return to the story I heard a noise and my whole bed shaked and I almost fell off. I made an inhuman noise, I was paralyzed and I needed new pants. My dad, on the second story, told me to calm down and that it was just an earthquake. Earthquakes are regular occurances where I live, and you hear about it on the news every time. Still shaken, I called my friends.

""Did you feel that earthquake? I almost fell off my bed!""

""What earthquake? Are you alright?""

No one had felt it, except me and my father who was close to me.

A week ago, we all heard footsteps upstairs.

A few days ago I woke up to a voice hissing at my face.

When they were doing renovations they found bloodstains and a pocketwatch under the floor with newspaper dating back to the 20s. They found a skeleton in the basement. The police and everyone basically said ""well it's in the past, fuck it!"" They'd hear screams in the night and glasses would shatter.

One time when my mom was sleeping she kept hearing a mouse under her bed. Eventually she checked, seeing nothing. When she got back into bed the mattress started peeling upwards from the corner. The way she explained it made it sound like something was holding down around the corner so only the tip would bend.

She used an ouija board, and when she did it said a demon with a female name (I can't remember it) wanted her. This happened twice, in two cities thousands of miles apart with different people. 

One time at an apartment she was watching tv with her friend and they heard a ripping sound. Later they found the stereotypical demon clawmark down a poster. 

Her friend was given a Satanic book and he buried it. Three years later is was dug up and was in mint condition. My mom wanted to check it out, because curiosity killed the cat, and he really didn't want her to. She did anyways and one night she was awoken at 3:33am to something ice cold and ""skeletal"" grabbing her wrist from under the bed. She heard ""Death from the grave"" in her head and there was the shape of a skull on her window.

She was making her bed and when the sheets began to settle after being shook, the shape of a kneeling figure emerged under the covers. She knocked it over immediately. This happened twice.

She was in bed in the late morning with our cat, and something started walking down the hall towards her room. Our cat started freaking out badly. Once it reached the doorway (obviously unseen) the cat lost its shit, and ran across the bed and under it. Whatever was at the door stayed for a while.

She was sitting on the couch with our other cat when something shoved the couch hard enough to make it move a few feet. Our cat was looking around, very confused.

She was watching tv late one night, when she heard some weird sounds upstairs, so she paused it. She heard a sound at the top of the stairs and then a very long, and drawnout growl. A deep, demonic growl. She froze, then went to the furthest away part of our house asking me to come home. Before I got there, sounds ended up happening at the bottom of the stairs too.


Now for a few of mine!

I woke up one Christmas Eve to something stomping around the attic above my bed. Now, I was about 12 (and sill believed in Santa because my parents loved the idea of me believing) so I was ecstatic and stayed awake listening to the 'reindeer'. I waited till it stopped (it was light out by now) and got my parents. They weren't thrilled that something with hoofs was above my bed.

I was having a nightmare that a shadow above my bed was trying to choke me and there was a massive banging going on. It was a really metallic bang and it was hitting in groups of three. I had my cat on my chest. I woke up struggling and and holding my cat. I opened my eyes when I realized how heavy my cat was and saw there wasn't a cat on me. The pressure suddenly vanished.

In December of 2005 at approximately 9:30/10:00 PM my Mother and Brother were driving to Lowes located in the western suburbs of Chicago. They arrived at their destination and found that Lowes was in fact closed and all of the lights in the parking lot were shut off. The two were slowly turning around in the parking lot about to make loop back to the turn-in area they came from and simultaneously saw an 'exceptionally white orb about 8-10 inches in diameter hovering in front of their car'. The orb floated approximately 10-15 ft in front of their windshield for about 5 seconds before shooting directly up into the night sky at a very high velocity. My brother, a pilot, is baffled by the acceleration of the said 'orb of light' saying its acceleration was instantaneous. The trajectory of the orb was also incredibly straight. My brother and mother both witnessed this incident at the same time.

After the incident they stopped in the parking lot and had talked about what they saw. Both say it was not a reflection of light due to the extreme luminosity, hovering motion and movement/flight path.

Some other notes: the car they were driving was a 2002 Chevy Trailblazer, Weather - a light dusting of snow was on the ground and very cold

Around five years ago, my husband and I experienced something for which we have no explanation. In the house we lived in back then, we went downstairs to the kitchen late at night to get something to drink, probably near 2:00am. We were talking and joking around like we usually do, then something caught our attention.

In our living room (which was part of a great room and clearly visible from the kitchen), hovering in the air about five feet off the ground, were these... sparkling things. They were very bright, looked the way twinkling stars do, were in a group of about seven, and they moved around but stayed in the same area and in a group. We both stood there and watched them for about fifteen seconds.

Suddenly, the entire group darted FAST to the left (our right) and we couldn't see them anymore. About five seconds later, I felt a strange sensation on my back. It felt like static electricity and it wasn't an unpleasant sensation, just really odd. I told my husband to look at my back to see if he saw anything. He looked and everything down my backside looked like it was being pulled away from my body. My hair, my shirt, my pants -- all looking like they were being pulled backwards.

After this went on for about twenty seconds, I was ready for it to stop. I told him to stand behind me and hold me close to him. He did and we both felt something slip out from between us and then it was gone.

About a month after that incident, I was sitting alone in a room, browsing the internet on my laptop, when something caught my attention. I looked to my left and a little behind me and I saw those same sparkles again. They weren't as bright because I was in a well-lit room. They floated around in a group about seven feet away from me for approximately ten seconds, then just disappeared.

We moved three years later into the house we currently live in. One night, about six months after we moved in, I heard a snap sound from the southeast corner of our room right after I'd gotten into bed. About three seconds later, I felt that same static electricity sensation on my back near the base of my spine. Startled, I quickly rolled onto my back (I had been laying on my right side facing my husband). The sensation stopped as soon as I did that and then I heard the snap sound again in the same corner.

A few months later, it happened again. The snap in the southwest corner of the room, then the sensation at the base of my spine. That time I decided to just be still and see what would happen. The sensation slowly worked its way all the way up my spine, pausing occasionally along the way. After it reached my head and paused again for a few seconds, it went away and I heard the departing snap again. This happened at least twice more after that, each incident about six months apart.

I've shared this story with quite a few people. A couple have said it might have been aliens implanting something and then returning to activate it. A few more said it might have been angels or light beings. The rest found it interesting but had no clue what it might have been. As for me, I'm totally clueless about what it could have been... and I'm wondering if it will be visiting me again in the future.

Some of the doorknobs were the original crystal knobs like [this](http://img1.etsystatic.com/000/0/5941564/il_fullxfull.165840941.jpg).  The closet (large walk-in with small irregular shaped window for light) had one of these knobs, and for some reason was particularly creepy to me, with no basis.  I always made sure the closet was closed before I went to sleep.

Once my best friend was over and we were hanging out.  With no prompting, she said ""the door handle on your closet is super creepy"" and I agreed with her. Later I was inside the closet looking for something before we were going to go out. My friend was sitting on my bed and we were talking.  Then I heard another female voice distinctly say ""JESSE!"" (my name) to which I replied ""what?""  My friend was confused about who I was talking to, since we were in the middle of conversation.  I thought it was a female roommate calling my name from the hallway, but there was no one out there, and my friend hadn't heard anyone say anything at all.  Shortly after, I switched to another bedroom and never had the creeped out feeling again, that was an everyday occurrence in the first room.

Just a weird thing that happened.  A few other strange things happened when I was a kid, but this is the first and only time that there was any sort of interaction.  ",,False,,t5_2sntx,1353886419.0,,,True,t3_13s61m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/13s61m/just_a_strange_closet/,

I was around 4 years old around Christmas and I was playing with my brother's toy motorcycle.

My mom took it away from me and put it in a place where I couldn't reach. They all left the room and apparently they heard me say ""Thank you!"" and saw that I was playing with the motorcycle. They claimed to have seen these little elves. I'm not really sure. I should ask my dad again.

Another time was 2 years ago when I was 17. I was talking on Gmail with my boyfriend at the time around 1am (way past my bedtime). Whether the door was slightly opened or not, I do not remember, but I remember hearing rattling on my doorknob and I suddenly think ""Crap, they caught me"" thinking it was gonna be my parents.

""[micheesie]!"" It says in a frustrated manner. It sounded like my mom so I turned around only to see this misty, cloudy figure that looked like Munch's The Scream (with the mouth open and all, but the hands weren't on the face).

I turn back to my computer screen feeling kinda amazed and confused (I wasn't really spooked, but the face was creepy.) I told my boyfriend  what I saw and said ""Oh cool, you saw a ghost!""

I went to see if my parents were asleep. They were... so I woke them up and told them what happened. They just told me to pray and ask what it wants if I see it again (I lived in a religious household).

I've seen it again during the daylight in the restroom. I was just walking down the hall and I see it peeking at me.

Another encounter that happened to me was about a year ago. I am still very confused about it...
It was midnight and I woke up seeing the corner of my room lit up. A huge yellow circle with the silhouette of a profile of a man (kinda looked like that Batman signal, but with a face). I tried to scream, but I couldn't, for some strange reason. 

And the last one which happened a couple of months ago. I was so frustrated with something that was going on and I gently tossed my glasses onto the carpet right below me. I got out of bed and tried to look for my glasses, but I couldn't find them (I have no pets).

My glasses, were behind the computer chair all the way diagonally across the room. They were between the little legs and by a trashcan. In the way were the chair adjustment thingies, so there is no way it could've gotten in between.

My old work place was a small cafe that cooked most of the baked goods out the back so there was a pretty big kitchen. The front of house was partitioned from the kitchen and storage area by a wall that didn't quite reach all the way to the ceiling. One day while closing two of my work buddies were going through the shutting roster and both saw a pair of feet standing on the bread loaf slicer. The guy thinking he was crazy asked the girl (who was super straight, very little jokes were made in her shifts.) and she confirmed it wasn't just him.

Also once the pastry chef would go home, often someone would call your name out from the kitchen, sometimes I'd actually walk behind there on auto-pilot to check what they wanted until I realised there was no one in the store at that time except me and the other staff member who was in the front with me. It happened to all of us though we never really chatted about it. 

Nobody saw anything else though.

The original Spooky Thomas post can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/11g7v7/me_spooky_thomas_xpost_from_rnosleep/)

Quick recap of everyone involved thus far:

Alex (boy with autism I worked with in his home)
Fiona (Alex's mother)
Spooky Thomas (the entity Alex sees)

-----

A while after Alex and his family moved into this apartment, they got  new dog, Jet. Jet was Alex's best friend in the world, and was fiercely protective of him. She began to get shut into the bathroom when nobody else was around. We thought that she was doing it to herself, until we noticed that she would end up with two or three parallel scratches on her back. The first thought was that she scraped herself on something in the bathroom, but upon investigation, we realized that there was nothing that would cause such marks. Once the family moved, this stopped happening.


-------

Fiona convinced me to come over and use a Ouija board at her house to see what Spooky Thomas has to say. I was a flat-out non-believer, and thought Ouija was a bunch of BS. To add to her fun, I bring the digital recorder I used in class. Fiona made her own Ouija board from wood. The following experiences are out of order, starting with what made me believe, followed by the rest of the experiences.

I called bullshit on the whole Ouija experience, so Fiona decided to do a test. She asked it about the special needs cousin, Terry, that I had fiercely loved but unfortunately had lost. She knew his death greatly saddened me, but did not know specifics (namely, that I felt he was being neglected and abused, and had been trying to get his caregiver [my father] to be held accountable for this by Adult Protective Services and the police. Terry, and was later found to be malnourished. My father inherited a large trust fund afterward. I still have not forgiven myself for failing Terry, and will never forgive my father). She asked if it knew anything about Terry, and it said it did. 

She asked for proof, and it spelled out, ""FORGVE"". For those familiar with Ouija, you know that spelling is not always the best on those things. She asked if there was anything else, and it spelled out, ""SMLE"". Terry was non-verbal, but whenever I was having a bad day or had been crying, he would draw a smile across his face with his fingers. She could not have known about me blaming myself and my father, and certainly could not have known about the smile gestures. 

Fiona asked the entity why it was there, and the response was, ""BOY"". The entity denied being there to harm her child, but when asked why it was there, the response was, ""SEESLITES"". Fiona wonders if her son's night terrors were something a bit more complex. 

When asked if there was more than one entity, an affirmative response was given. When asked if any of them wished harm upon them, or her child, the response was affirmative. When asked who, ""DOG"" was given as a response.

The voice recordings were mostly just us ladies talking, but on three occasions, other voices were heard. A male voice (same voice?) heard saying, ""THEY NEED TO STOP."" and ""WHAT DID SHE SAY?""
A female was heard saying, ""I CAN'T BREATHE.""

Fiona's sister, Cassandra, felt something grab her shoulder. We looked, and she had a long red mark ( not a scratch) on her back. She also kept getting the feeling like someone was standing next to her and had to move because of it.

On two separate occasions, the planchet moved in a lazy 8 figure, and drifted toward the edge of the board. We steered it back onto the board, saying ""Talk with us please."" Later research seemed to indicate that those two things indicate a malevolent entity/one trying to ""escape"". Perhaps people more knowledgable will enlighten me as to the validity of that.

------

I left feeling nauseous and weak, like I had a mild flu, and felt that way for a day or two afterward. I'm not sure if that is coincidence, or related.

1349789765.0,20,self.Thetruthishere,1170ob,[me] the house i grew up in,helenres,27,7,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1170ob/me_the_house_i_grew_up_in/,"this is a little collection of some of the things that happened to me in the house i spent the first 18 years of my life in. i do believe it was haunted but i welcome any discussion that might provide any answers.

The house was not very old it was built in the post-war era so early 50's, it was a 3 bed semi-detached with a nice sized garden. me being the youngest child got the smallest room that was at the front of the house on the second floor and it was directly opposite the bathroom across the landing and my brothers room was directly to the right of mine so the doors were sort of at a 90 degree angle and my parents room is next to my brothers, sorry but this is sort of relivent.

the first thing i can remember is just a horrible feeling on the landing, i used to have to run from my room to the bathroom and back because it felt like something was just behind me, something that was just not nice, it felt like this during the night and day. when i was about 5/6 i was playing with a doll house in my room with my back to the door which was open and like i said before faces the length of the landing. it was the middle of the day on a weekend and i could hear my parents in the living room downstairs watching the tv. when out of the blue i felt someone standing in my doorway, i knew no one had come up the stairs but there was someone there looking at me. i have never been that scared before or after that moment i froze solid, barely breathing i didn't dare look round. i stayed in the same position for a good solid 20 minutes then it just went. i remember thinking 'oh its gone everything is fine now' and i skipped down stairs like nothing happened.

the creepy feeling was still on the landing but that was the most intense encounter with the 'thing' as i call it. after my big brother moved out when i was about 14 i moved into his room as it was bigger this is where the really creepy stuff happened, but first back to the landing for a minute. at this time my parents used to travel about 180 miles to stay with my nan at the weekends to help her out and to go hiking and clay pigeon shooting around that area and they had started leaving me at home instead of dragging me with them, which was fine with me i would just camp out in the lounge watching sci-fi channel all weekend. the only problem was again the 'thing' on the landing, whenever i was alone in the house the light wouldn't work. there was 2 switches for the light one down stairs and one on the landing. but neither of them would work i would have to run up the stairs and turn all the bedroom lights on as fast as i could. i must say the wiring was checked and nothing was found to be wrong with it.

my brothers room i moved into had the airing cupboard in the corner opposite the door and the bed was in the corner diagonal to this cupboard and the first thing i noticed was the dark shadow that stood in front of the cupboard it was there every night and it appeared to be independent of the wall. once or twice i woke up to find it had moved a little bit closer to the bed, on those nights i slept with the light on. it never did anything to hurt me though so i soon started to ignore it.

A couple of years later when i was about 17 i had gone to bed normally about 3ish in the morning, i had just turned the light off which was a pull cord right next to my bed so i could turn it on and off without getting up. anyway i had just turned it off and wrapped myself up in the cover and i mean i sleep like a burrito or something so there wasn't any cover overhanging the side or end of the bed. then the cover started sliding off me towards the end of the bed at first i though that some of the cover was just slipping of the end so i pulled it back up and tried to go to sleep. but it happened again so i turned the light on to check and there was nothing there and the cover was not over the end of the bed i kept the light on for the rest of the night and it was fine till morning. the next night my boyfriend was staying over and we had just turned the light off and it started doing it again but this time it felt like someone had taken the end of the cover and shook it to create the little waves if you get what i mean. it kept going on until i turned the light on again. i told my mum about it the next day and she told me to clean up my room and stay over my boyfriends house that night and she would take care of it. she wouldn't tell me what she was going to do but i did what she said and when i came back the next day she just said that it wouldn't bother me anymore. i still to this day can't get her to tell me what she did but the bed covers never got pulled off my bed again. lots more creepy thing have happened to me over the years but this is all that happened to me in this house so i will leave it there for now.

I'm living in germany and english is not my mother tongue. So please excuse if you find any mistakes in that text. 

So my parents have this friend, who is an artist (I will call him Tom), is married and has two children. They bought an unbuilt plot years ago. When they dug a hole for their new basement, they found an old street. They believe it belonged to romans hundreds of years ago. 

Whatever. After they finished building their new house many strange things happened. I don't know everything. Just a few. 

1. They have a little dog. One day he started to face a corner of their living room and barked and growled at it without any reason. There was nothing. 

2. Tom and one of his daughters were sitting in the living room and suddenly they saw a shadow of a cat. (As far as I know, they had no cat at that time.) He said to his daughter: ""What did you see?"". She said yes. And he asked: ""What have you seen?"" She said: ""I saw the shadow of a cat."" So he first asked her before telling her, that he saw the same. 

3. They got the turkish eye (the one that protects you from the evil or so) from a friend and placed it on a shelf. In front of the eye they had Chips, and on both sides were other things. Dunno what they placed exactly. So they went eat (another room obviously) and they heard a loud crack. Like something hit the ground. When Tom checked what happened, he found the Eye broken on the ground. More strange is the fact, that all those things around the eye were still at their place.

4. Tom had a dream were he burried his father (again), however the casket hit the ground and his father was facing him and told him ""to take care of the issue"". Tom had no idea what his father was talking about and thought it was just a bad dream. About three days later, his sister's children called him and told him that their mother was using his mother's money shamelessly. (Dunno how to explain tbh D; )
Coincidence? 

5. Remember the fallen eye from the shelf? They placed a decorative bowl on that shelf later. It broke into two pieces without any reason. 

I think that's all I can remember. My parents told me that after he was visiting us last week. 
Does this anything has to do with the romans? My parents think there was a burial place or something like that. I don't know if they found bones. I only know about this street.

I am very new here. That being said, I'm not very familiar with this community yet, so this post might get downvoted into oblivion, but I don't really care. At this point I just really need some answers.
I have two really close friends (they are siblings) whom I stay with a lot. They come from a wiccan family, but they do not practice anymore, except for keeping crystals around the home, and I have always attracted the paranormal for whatever reason... usually negative. 

For the past few months they've had an entity in their closet. At first they deemed it harmless. All it did was move objects around... you know, cute stuff. Now it's gotten way out of hand, and I think it's my fault. I was staying a few nights ago, and there was a very heavy feeling throughout their house. I was deeply shaken- I had chills, and I just couldn't tear my eyes away from the closet door, which lost its knob quite some time ago. I asked my friends if we could block the hole somehow, and one of them got a sock and stuffed it through the doorknob hole. We also put four crystals at each corner of the door for safe measures.

We went to sleep normally, but I kept waking up feeling very uneasy. When we woke up in the morning, the sock was on the floor a few feet away from the door. I was really disturbed; I felt like it had been watching us sleep. I guess it wasn't that weird, but we are three young women, so any form of peeping from the living or otherwise tends to make me uncomfortable.

That day I suggested that we try to catch our little friend on film. We set up a camera facing the closet door and went downstairs for coffee. After we finished, we went back to the loft to find the camera turned off. We watched the tapes with no evidence appearing until a few seconds before the film stopped. The space around the door seemed to ripple. We thought that was interesting, so we moved the camera to film a different spot in the room, and turned it on. We sat around upstairs for a while with nothing strange happening, so one of my friends spoke up and said, ""I kind of want to see something move. I want to see how it does it."" As if planned, a few minutes later the camera clattered to the ground. We went over the video, and it was very interesting. (With my friends' permission I might be able to upload the videos we got, but I'm sorry if they decide they don't want to be on the internet). Nothing happened again until shortly before the camera fell to the ground. My friend had gone into the closet to get something, and her shadow was seen on the mirror in the video going in. Another shadow was seen coming out shortly after. We assumed it was her exiting the closet, but she was seen walking out after the other shadow passed over the mirror. Then the camera fell before our very eyes. The entity was becoming less shy.
After that incident, we set out a wooden art dummy in a basic standing position on the dresser, and decided to film different points in the room for about ten minute increments. All we got was the camera occasionally turning off in the middle of filming, but the camera had a full battery. 

We decided to give it a rest and go downstairs. Of course, when we came back up we noticed the dummy. Its right hand was bent up as if to shake someone's hand. We all suspected each other, but none of us had been in the room. The room also had a colder feel to it, and everything was just generally eerie. I decided to go home. I had family coming in anyway. I'm slightly uncomfortable in my home as well because I have a little friend who likes to play with my deadbolt, but that's a different post.

Today I recieved a text from my friend asking me to come back ASAP. Apparently they did a little more investigating while I was at home, and they described a video I have yet to see.Apparently they were shooting the closet door again. They tell me that at the end of the video the closet door opens, followed by the film stopping suddenly. My friend told me she checked the camera because she heard the previously closed closet door slam loudly.
 
They're telling me that being in the room is almost unbearable now. They both feel aggressive, and the entire house has a dark, heavy feeling again. They say when they are in the loft, they feel it looking right over their shoulder. I'm going back in tomorrow to watch the video and stay the night. I think we're going to try to get this thing out, whatever it is. 

My question to you all is what could this thing be? I wasn't going to post this, but we are desperate to know what this previously light and harmless entity is. It used to be shy, but it's come out of its shell, and I feel that I triggered it by suggesting we film everything. Anyway, if you know what this is or how to get rid of it, please leave your advice, it is much appreciated! I apologize for any spelling/grammar mistakes. Tomorrow or sometime soon I will update and tell you all if our removal of the spirit was successful, and hopefully I can provide you all with our videos. 

Thank you so much for any help you can give us. We're getting kind of scared, Reddit.

cross. Halfway over, my mother turned to her grandfather and said, "" I changed my mind. I don't want to leave my daughter (my older sister)"". He said fine and she woke up. She was concerned, but quickly dissmised it as just missing her grandpa.

The next night, she had the dream again. She was back at the road, except now her grandma was there as well as her grandpa. She also had my older sister with her. They asked her again if she would like to come
 with them. She felt better because she had my sister with her. Again, they started to cross. About halfway, my mom changed her mind again. She told them that she wanted to stay. She told them that are plenty of people in Mexico, where her family lives, that would go with them.. They looked sad, and told her okay. Then she woke up.

A week later, her sister died in her sleep.

I was 14 and didn't like being around my family. I stayed up all night and normally went to sleep around 7 AM. I wasn't religious in any way and wanted nothing to do with the Catholic church my family belonged to. I was really depressed and it was worse when I was around people that loved me. now on to the story, and it's going to be a long one (sorry!)...

I began to feel like I was being watched. it wasn't all the time, sometimes it was for just a minute and others it was for hours on end. I had always believed in the paranormal but I brushed it off as paranoia. then things started to get more weird. I had a stereo that would turn on and off in the middle of the night. my phone would light up as if someone had touched the lock button, but it would be on the other side of the room. again, I ignored it all. I would be sitting on my bed on my laptop and feel the need to stare at a chair I had sitting by my window. this went on for a few weeks before I really saw anything. I went to bed earlier than normal one night (around 4 AM) and woke up to the feeling of being watched. I immediately looked over to the chair and saw a man. he had a hat on and was wearing an overcoat, other than that I couldn't tell much. all he did was look at me. I didn't feel scared in the least, I felt comfort coming from him. I relaxed enough to lay back down and when I did, he was gone. this man continued to show up in my room, always in the chair, over the next few months. my depression got worse and I took to cutting myself. whenever I pulled my razors out, I felt like I was being watched and a wave of guilt flooded over me. and every night that I cut, I would see the man in my chair frowning. some time passed and I began to see him in my dreams. he never talked, only treated me like I was his daughter. 

after some time, my depression lessened once again to the point where I was able to pull myself out of my room and hang out with my friends. we had sleepovers a lot back then (never at my place) so I was sleeping at home less than normal. a few times my forgetful mother called me on my phone to tell me it was too late to pace around my room and to get to bed. this only happened when I was at a friend's house. this is around the time when I told my mom about what I had been experiencing. we talked it out and she believed me, as she had had experiences herself all throughout her life. we came to the conclusion that the man was harmless and paced around because he worried when I wasn't home. I'll never know if that's the real reason, but it always fit the situation. it was comforting to feel like I had someone watching over me, trying to keep me safe and out of trouble. he was like a guardian angel.

it wasn't long before my brother and cousin found out about everything. I was sitting at the dining room table talking about the ghost with my mom, brother, and cousin. actually...my cousin and brother were doing all of the talking. they said I should get my room blessed to see if it helped and they called me crazy when I said I didn't want him to leave. my brother said he didn't believe me, and that I was nuts. my cousin said the ghost should get a hobby and move the fuck out. they later regretted everything they said that day.

about a week later, my brother was taking a nap in the afternoon and I was with some friends in town. my mom told me when I got home that he woke up and starting screaming his head off and ran down to her room. he was crying and saying, ""I believe her now. there's a ghost."" when she asked what had happened, he said he woke up to his bed shaking and the covers were pulled tight around him. after struggling quite a bit he was able to free himself and he ran as fast as he could from his room. he started sleeping on the couch in the living room after that day.

a few days after my brother's incident, my family went out to dinner. I got a call from my cousin as we were leaving the restaurant. she said she had gone into the house while we were gone to clean. when she walked down the hall toward the stairs (that are right by my room) she saw my dog growling at my door. now, the dog I had back then was a great guard dog. he never growled unless someone was in the house that wasn't supposed to be there. she walked over to my door and tried to turn the handle, but it wouldn't budge. thinking I was in there with the door locked, she knocked on the door and called for me. as soon as she did, my door started shaking like someone was kicking it from the inside. she said she ran out of the house and was waiting in her car for us to get home, because she didn't want to be in there alone. after those two incidents, I became afraid of the man. I wanted him gone if he was going to attack my family. and I don't think he liked that.

nobody said anything bad about the ghost after that. my mom tried to perform a blessing on my room when I was at school one day. every night after that, I had nightmares. each time it was the same thing. I was on my bed and decided to leave my room. whenever I made it to my door, the door would slam shut and the man would be blocking it. I tried everything I could think of in my dreams to get past him, but nothing worked. I woke up every morning crying.

after about a month or more of the nightmares, I decided to tell my mom about them. the next day in school, she tried the blessing again and once she finished, she yelled something along the lines of, ""you have no right to be torturing my daughter. what you NEED to do is to go into the light. you don't belong in this world and I'll be damned if you'll stay."" 

everything went back to normal again after that day. there was no more nightmares, no more feelings of being watched and no more waking up to see the man watching me. that was the end of it all.

It’s a quiet town of about 5000 people with a decent mix of woods, city, and country. Ever sense I can remember, I've heard stories about ""Morrow Road"", a road roughly 3 or 4 miles from my house. The legend says (and this is all over the interwebs) A Mother loses her baby (kidnapped, wandered away, a few different variations) and dies in the process of searching for her baby. to this very day she wanders the woods surrounding the road, but more particularly, the legend says she haunts the morrow road bridge. I’ve known this story growing up, and have been fascinated with it sense I heard it. Before I was born, the bridge in question was packed down, and the half of the dirt road it was on was paved over. The other half (still dirt) has its own small bridge that newcomers go to for lack of better knowledge. In high school, my friend got his first car. One of our cheapest thrills was going out to morrow road. Our first time we tried the traditional ""park on the bridge, honk your horn 3 times and put your keys on the roof of the car, and some old bitch comes and rapes your face"" trick that was so popular to the evolution of the story. A couple weekends with no success and we decided to try a different spot. we found a clearing roughly 150' x 150' ( 42°39'4.46""N, 82°34'32.73""W) We Decided sense it was not near a house, and we could park off the road a bit that we would stay there. Friday night again proved nothing, so we packed up and hit the road at about 12:30 A.M., Saturday night, we set off late, and it was roughly 2:30 when we arrived. We sat in our normal spot, listening, waiting... windows down, quiet, looking around. We sat until roughly 3:30, entertaining ourselves with ""did you hear that? what was that"" when to our surprise, we hear the unmistakable sound of a babies cry in the woods, pretty close to the road on the side opposite of the clearing. We were gone.... we could not believe what we had heard... and we also noted, it was 3 AM. We went back again and again, through the week and we saw or heard virtually nothing out of the ordinary unless it was between 3-4. We laid off of the road for a year or so... he started college and only came home on the weekends, and I started a full time job, so our trips were few and far between. A house had begun construction on the site where we liked to sit and knowing that spot, I began to hear about all the mysterious setbacks the project had suffered. With new construction torn apart the next morning, a water heater explosion, and a couple other incidents I can’t remember. The house was finally constructed, and the new family that had it built had moved in.... if only for a while. Never did know the family that had moved in, but I do know.... they were only there for roughly 6 months. By this time, I had a shift change and I was able to hang out on the weekends as late as I wanted. We started going to Morrow Road again, and we had our system down. We'd leave at 3 am, sit at the clearing in front of the abandoned house and wait. First night out, I had a video camera (back in the day when they took those little tapes that you needed a VCR adapter for) and we recorded out of my passenger window (facing the clearing) with night vision on. We had thought we caught nothing, until we reviewed the tape at home.... what we caught was a shadow, like smoke, blowing into the middle of the frame, our jaws dropped as it formed into a humanoid figure.... and stood still looking at us... and blew away as it had come in... The whole thing took about 5 seconds, my buddy said to me ""we're idiots..."" I looked at him sideways thinking, ""idiots?... are you watching the.... I mean, you saw the..... with the staring...."" he said ""you were breathing on the window..."" we kind of had a quick laugh, until I said. ""my window was all the way down so I could listen"" he had the video until a few years ago... his hard drive crashed. total bummer, but all of our friends had seen it anyways so no big deal. we had been out to the road about 10 more times, each with very weird things i dont care to explain. (like the white noise saying his name as we turned off of the road to go home) One of the last times we went was by far the most eventful. its a regular night as usual, we started off at a mutual crush's house (that bastard) talking and hanging out with her and her brother. we get to the topic of morrow road, and her brother jumps at the chance to go with us. We wait a couple hours until 3, and head out to the spot. As we sit in front of the abandoned house looking into the clearing, I see a green humanoid blob pacing in front of the house from side to side. Thinking it was my eyes adjusting I didn’t say anything until it was said for me. “you guys see the green blob going back and fourth?” We both agreed with our eyes fixed on it. We watch for a few more seconds and the blob starts making its way slowly towards the car. We realize what’s happening and start yelling to get the hell out of there… Though we really didn’t need to as the driver saw it walking towards us too. once the car started, the blob started flying toward the car, like a Kenyan in full sprint…. As we spun the tires and pulled away, the blob got to what I would say about 10’ of the car, we all saw a human figure, my buddy in the seat in front of me on the same side of the car said it looked as if it was wearing gown. the blob followed us about 15’ down the road and disappeared. I watched behind us as it did so… that was one of our last trips to the road… and I’ll never doubt the existence of ghosts",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_txvmc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/txvmc/a_road_in_michigan/,

in the last few months I have been experiencing night terrors and more recently, sleep paralysis. I have never suffered from this sort of thing before, never had nightmares as a child etc. 

in the early hours of this morning I was asleep as usual, when my door handle woke me up. It sounded like someone had turned it and let go very fast, causing a loud snapping noise. I ignored it and attempted to go back to sleep.

I entered a sleep paralysis state, being fully conscious (with my eyes closed) but unable to move. I saw a demon in the corner made of smoke, with a completely white face, with no discernible feature except black eyes. 

In my head I prayed, and it faded in and out a few times but didn't disappear totally. My cat (who was on the bed with me) meowed loudly which 'woke' my brain up properly. 

To add to this, my SO has felt like he is being watched all the time, and he also took a photo of me sleeping on the couch (a bit blurry: http://i.imgur.com/oHcRg.jpg)
with some weird thing floating in the frame. Could this be connected??

After doing lots of research, it seems to be quite common to see ghosts/demons. There is also no cure :( has anyone else experienced similar things? Or stopped SP from occurring completely?? Any advice would be appreciated!

Edit: just wanted to say thank you to everyone who provided advice:) I will definitely not be sleeping on my back, and will try turn these episodes into something positive, should it happen again. Thanks again, and good luck to all the other SP sufferers out there (there's a lot of us!).

1333883153.0,20,self.Thetruthishere,rz3z2,[ME]Trying to Separate Paranormal from Explainable.,KingKaribu,20,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/rz3z2/metrying_to_separate_paranormal_from_explainable/,"I've been living in my current home for essentially all my life. For the majority of my time here, it's been pretty normal and without incident. Up until roughly 5-6 years ago I never really gave a second thought to the notion of my house being 'haunted' or the like other than the basic ""I just watched a horror movie so now everything is scary"" kind of thing. But since that 5-6 years ago things have been really strange and sometimes unsettling and down-right scary. I would just like to hear the theories of other people. 

When this stuff started I usually shrugged it off as me hearing things, sometimes sleep paralysis, being overly tired or paranoid, etc. But certain things got out of hand. I apologize if the title is tagged wrong but MOST of the happenings I'm going to talk about are first-hand from myself. A few are from trusted friends, but those ones tend to be shorter due to the fact that they didn't always realize something weird was happening.

Anyway, around the time these things began I had decided to move into the basement of my house instead of living on the second story. It was all furbished and comfortable and I thought it would provide privacy. 
The early happenings were things I noticed but usually just got annoyed at, blaming bad luck. For example, there were quite a few electrical issues that began around the time I decided to sleep down there. The television would change channels on its own, lights would turn on while I was sleeping and wake me up, my speakers would sometimes make strange clicking noises that I always tried to replicate by putting devices near them( Which never worked.) I would always just say something along the lines of ""Damn the electronics down here must be really messed up."" or ""Maybe it's surging and causing this."" But repairs never seemed to change anything.

After that I started having really strange dreams. What I was actually dreaming about is irrelevant but what would always happen eventually was that a small, grey, emaciated human-looking creature would show up. I would always know it was there because everything around it made a very specific looking decay that made everything around it look like it had aged far beyond the age of its relative surroundings. And, when I saw the creature, or even just the decay, I would immediately comprehend that I was dreaming(basically entering a lucid dreaming state.) and go try to confront it. But, whenever I tried to see its face I would wake up immediately. Now I won't point to the dreams as proof of anything but once they started occurring, real world things began to occur as well.

I would be hanging about, watching TV, playing video games, hanging with friends, and so on, and me/we would hear voices in various places. The voices had no apparent source, weren't always easy to understand and, most importantly, did not match the voice of anyone in the house. And the phenomena was not specific to myself, as a friend of mine had just arrived downstairs and told me he heard my mother in the garage and asked what she was doing in there. But, at the time, my mother had been halfway across the country; visiting my sister.

In general, friends of my claimed the house scared them and a recent girlfriend was terrified to be in my basement alone, or even be awake alone while we were down there.

Over time things got more strange, voices got louder. And one night that sticks out was a night in which I was doing nothing in particular and I decided to get a glass of water from the kitchen. So I head upstairs and pour the water and as I'm heading towards the basement door again I hear my name whispered from a few rooms over in the same story I was on. It was whispered like someone looking for another person during hide and seek with the vowels accented. I stood there for a few minutes, responded and never got a response. So I spent the rest of the night, mostly terrified. 

The night the really bugs me most is a night I managed to get to sleep(I basically slept less and less as time went on because the dreams made me wake up unhappy and feeling exhausted.) it was about 3-4AM and I wake up. I didn't know why I woke up. But then I heard my mom say ""KingKaribu(Obvious name substitute.), it's time to wake up."" Like she used to say when I was younger. I started to get up and then froze halfway through getting off the bed as my mother was, once again, not in the state, let alone the house. (I should mention my mom spends about 1/4 of the year out of the state.) And I'm pretty certain I wasn't dreaming when the words were spoken and I was under the effects of sleep paralysis(which I've only experienced once.) Needless to say. I didn't go back to sleep or leave my room.

Now basic facts about my house that make the 'haunted' aspect kind of strange.

My house was built by my father in 1994. The house is build on what was clearly old farmland with old rock walls still nearby, but none of my neighbors say they have experiences anything like I have at their own homes. 

The only linking factors I can see between anything and the 'haunting' are that it began when I moved into the basement and one I haven't mentioned yet. Which is, around the same time we were building an addition onto our home and we dug up a rather coincidental foundation stone. The foundation stone said 1794 on it, which is pretty spooky considering that 1794 is exactly 200 years before we built our home here(without months included.)

I'll include a picture of that foundation stone, which is now part of the masonry in our chimney.

I was about 7 years old when this happened. I was staying at my pregnant aunt's house for the night. When I used to stay at her house I would sleep on her bedroom floor because I didn't want to sleep downstairs on the couch by myself. Anyway, I had a strange dream that night. In the dream, I was woken up by a baby crying. So I went to the future foal's room. There was crib in the middle of the room and of course that's where the crying was coming from. So I walked over to it and looked over the edge. I saw a baby with its mouth sewn shut. I woke up suddenly and of course, as a seven year old, I was terrified. Four years later the kid starts learning to speak. But something's not right. They take him to a doctor, and he is diagnosed with a speech impairment.

This is a story that the same aunt told me when I was about ten. Every morning she would drink her coffee on her back porch; she had this super tacky wicker chair set. One morning she we t out and all the chairs were gone. She has two levels to her back yard, and on both levels the wicker chairs were gone. She kind of forgets about it and drinks her coffee inside, she had a lot of stuff to do that day. So the next day, as she walked by her back door window, she noticed something different. She went outside and there were all her wicker chairs, in a huge pile, torn to shreds in the middle of her yard. That's not it though, they were covered in blood. I know this is a now third hoof story now, me telling it to you, but it's still interesting nonetheless.

The rest of these stories are all me. At the time of this one I was either 12 or 13. I had a dream that I was at a funeral. I didn't know who it was for, but my family was all around me, looking very sad. I had this sense that it was someone who died early, like it wasn't their time. I wake up, unnerved but I carry on with my day. Two weeks later, my mom gets a call. Her cousin died in a car accident the night before. I never went to the funeral though, since I never met him before, even my mom didn't know him that well.

This one, two years after the death, is just beyond weird. A serious ಠ_ಠ um wut. I was home alone, watching a movie, if you must know is was Lady in the Water, and I decided I NEED SOME MOTHERFUCKING HOT CHOCOLATE. So I paused my movie, set the kettle, prepared my mug and waited. Then I heard the audio from the movie like it had unpaused, which would not be weird if it was VHS but this was a DVD. So I'm like NOOO I DON'T WANT TO MISS ANYTHING and run to the living room to repause it. But that's the thing, it was still paused in the same frame as it was when I left it. I was WTFing but I heard the kettle whistle so I went back to the kitchen. Sitting on the counter, is my hot chocolate, already made complete with marshmallows.

These two are fairly recent, within the past two months. First one: I was doing some laundry when I felt something watching me. I had been having that feeling a lot lately, but I never saw anything. It would do any harm to tell whatever it is to fuck off, so I did. ""Fuck off, you are not welcome here and you never were."" The feeling leaves me and I go back to the kitchen where I belong and start making supper. Standing in front of the oven, I look past the kitchen doorway and watch a misty, white figure glide towards my front door. FUCKING NOPE but at least it left.

Second, much less NOPE-worthy: laying in bed on a Tuesday morning. Think to myself, I should check if it's a snow day. I get out of bed and open my window and see that it is nice out, wet because winter is ending but not bad enough to warrant a snow day. So I start walking to school and see my grandma at the bank. She says to me ""Oh, lucky you! No school today!""(she knew because she works there) I was thinking Are you fucking kidding me I should have listened to myself earlier, but NOPE logic had to get in the way.
So yeah there's my stories. I've always had spirits and entities attracted to me and I will try to remember some more stories! I apologize, writing is not a talent I possess.

Sadly, this is a completely true story, but I've only shared it with one other person before. I've been with Reddit for sometime now, so I know this is the right place for my story.
Back some years ago, when I was in the third grade, my mother, father, and I moved up to New Hampshire from North Carolina. We lived there for nearly four years; during the last year we lived there, my age being ten, weird things started happened that I just couldn't explain.
Now note, all my life I had been skeptical of the ""paranormal"" but this changed my view on that forever. We lived in a tiny two bedroom apartment in a small three story building. The first things that happened were to my mother: she would be in the bathroom (unfortunately with the door open -__-) and would watch the closet across the hall open and close itself. She would also watch towels pick themselves up slightly and just sit back down. Being a kid that questioned everything, I thought she was just shitting me trying to scare me. If only that had been the case.
I had a few friends spending the night with me and we were playing school in my mom's room, since it was the biggest. It was dark and rainy outside, which sounds so cliche with this story. We had the window open due to our apartment being so hot, and we started to hear intense crying. It was sobbing almost. You could hear the cracking in the crying as it got so high pitched. Being the nosy kids we were, we went over to the window to see what was going on. I wish we hadn't gone over to that window.
We saw what appeared to be a woman, with long black hair, standing in the very middle of the road, right in front of our building. She had this long black dress, and was standing under a huge, black umbrella. The crying just stopped. She snapped her head back and had the most devilish grin on her face you could imagine. She winked and it was almost like she had been hit by a car, because her spine snapped in the most unnatural position, backwards and sideways all at once. She disappeared. Went up into smoke, so to speak.
Keeping in mind we were just kids, we freaked out and jumped onto my mom's bed. Afterwards we started to laugh about it. I got off the bed and began talking about how our minds were just playing tricks on us and we were foolish for ever thinking that really just happened. But, it seemed that I spoke too soon.
We heard cracking, like the way you crack your neck after staying in the same position for a long time. the bed bumped upward and my friends covered their mouth with their hands to keep from screaming and bothering our parents in the other room. I, being the only one standing on the floor, just stood their in pure shock. I was immediately shoved down onto the floor with full force, and something started dragging me under the bed. I was yelling, trying to grab hold of something to keep me from being pulled under. My friends got off of the bed and grabbed a hold of my arms, trying to stop me from being dragged under the bed by God knows what. We heard the intense sobbing again, and whatever it was let go of my legs. When I got up, shaken beyond tears, you could see the claw marks around my ankles, and I was starting to bruise up around my shoulders where I had been pushed down. The last thing we ever heard was, ""I just want him to love me again.""
I still to this day cannot figure out what happened that night, but I did figure out who that woman was. A woman named Caren that had lived in the apartment some odd years ago, before it was remodeled. Her psychotic boyfriend had been drinking and the night she went out into the rain to find him, he had hit her with his car.

One night I woke up some time in the middle of the night and saw a figure of a man standing in the door illuminated by the moonlight. Strangely I was not scared or startled by the man but rather felt at peace and that nothing was wrong. I had never seen the man before but I remember very clearly that he was tall with glasses and curly hair. He wore a brown jacket with a white shirt and jeans and was walking a small dog with curly black hair. He just stood there and smiled looking over the bed I was sharing with my mother. I tried to wake her up but she kept sleeping and when I looked back the man was gone. 
The next day I described the man to my mom and she had a very strange look on her face. When I told her the man was walking a little black dog she began to cry. She pulled out an old photo album and showed me pictures of my grandfather who died 2 years before I was born and sure enough it was the same man I had seen the night before. The dog he was walking was his favorite dog that was hit by a car when my mom was a kid. I had never really seen pictures of him before and I had never even heard of the dog he was with and I'm still really confused by all of it. 

When I think about what happened that night I can still clearly see the image of my grandfather standing in the doorway and it brings me a feeling of comfort knowing that he is watching over my family.

They lived in this really nice old home in a nicer part of town.

We're in his back room playing some Sega Genesis, home alone as his mother went to meet a friend, and his cat comes in and starts pestering us. Nick knows that she wants some food, so he asks me ""hey, want to come down to the basement to feed the cat with me?"" so I say ""sure"".

We make our way through the kitchen and we get to the staircase that leads down to the basement. Now I wasn't already too fond of the basement, there had been instances before where I had been locked down there before as a joke (we would pull that kind of stuff on each other all the time). Since it's a fairly old house, the basement wasn't the nicest of places. It had old, small, cloudy windows that let in hardly any light. Nick's parents collected a lot of random things, and it was all piled down in the basement, with a path just wide enough for two people to navigate down there.

Nick flicks the light on and we make our way down. Nick can go first, I don't want him tricking me down and locking the door behind. He gets to the bottom of the stairs and calls up to me ""Evan, you coming?"". I make my way down the stairs and look around. I had never seen his cat's dish down here, so I have no idea where we're going.

""The cat's food dish is at the back there."" Nick says, as he points to a small nook towards the back of the giant basement. So we walk over there, the cool cement floor making each step quicker and quicker. I remember it being chilly down there, but it was such an old basement that it was always cold.

We get to the little dish, and of course, it's completely empty. Nick grabs the bag of cat food sitting beside it and starts to pour it in to dish. I notice that there's an old wooden door in the nook, so I tug at Nick's shirt and say ""what's behind there?"". He looks up, and shrugs ""I don't know, I think it's a cellar.""

For some reason or another, my curiosity got the better of me. ""Why don't we take a look?"" His parents had all sorts of cool things in the basement, like big gold birdcages, masks, armoires filled with old toys and clothes. I expected to find a room full of riches.

Nick opens the door, but it's pitch black. It was certainly a cellar, as it had the cold dank smell pour out of it. The orange glow from the light by the stairs didn't quite make it all the way to the room.

We stand in the doorway and Nick reaches in to find a light. I remember hearing the slapping from his hand and he searched for a switch. Then click. The light flickers on, and in the middle of the room a rocking chair, slowly rocking back and forth. We stood there, watching it make full rocks from tip to tip, showing no signs of stopping.

Nick just lets out this yelp, and I try to find my voice to let one out, but I couldn't make a sound. We both spin around and just scramble as fast as we could out of the basement. We went up two flights of stairs to the second floor faster than I thought was humanly possible. We jump on to his bed, and just wait there until his mom gets home.

Later that night after I'd gone home, I repeat the story to my mother. She seems a little freaked out, but tells me that we must have bumped it our something and didn't get a good enough look.

Eventually my own mother brings up the story with Nick's mother. And here is where the story gets even freakier.

Apparently, when they purchased the house, it came with a lot of furniture in it. They used to keep that rocking chair in Nick's sister's room, but occasionally she would complain of it rocking at night when she was trying to fall asleep. They didn't believe her, but one night while Nick's mom was in checking up on her, she opened the door to the room and saw the rocking chair, slowly rocking back and forth, just as we had seen it in the basement that day.

Don't ask me why they didn't just get rid of the chair, but they stored it down the basement's cellar for years and years before we had rediscovered it. That scene is forever etched in my mind, and makes my hair stand on end just remembering it.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_k0est,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/k0est/the_old_rocking_chair_xpost_from_rnosleep/,
1313731387.0,20,self.Thetruthishere,jnkw3,The Crawlspace (/x/post from /r/nosleep),,25,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/jnkw3/the_crawlspace_xpost_from_rnosleep/,"I've had my run ins with some fucked up shit in the past, and I posted a story about it a couple days ago, but this is something else that has been freaking me out. .

When I moved into this house, I thought it was quaint enough. It's a fairly spacious place with 4 floors, 2 and a half baths, a decent kitchen, and two living room/dens. It's divided between the basement, where the laundry room and a couple bedrooms are, the ground floor (where my room is), the kitchen/living room level, and the top floor for more bedrooms. 

After I had finished unpacking everything in my room, I went down to stuff a couple of giant tupperware containers, and a suitcase, into the crawl space. The crawlspace is directly right of the staircase out of the basement. It's pretty expansive, and it's got a low ceiling, but it's perfect for storage due to it being easily accessible, and quite large.

When I opened the square door to the crawlspace, there was a chill. I realize it's a bit of a cliche, but it's true. I had moved in at the beginning of April, so I just put it down to the snow being outside, and cold concrete walls. I grabbed a construction light, one of those ones with the metal grill and the hook on top for hanging it, and ventured in. I went to the far right corner, which is about 20 feet away from the door. I put my stuff into the corner, without looking around. I've become a person who doesn't like looking behind me if spooked, or looking around a creepy area first. I attribute this to too many horror stories and movies, with someone always turning around, seeing nothing, then turning back with a axe murderer in their face. Nonetheless, I digress.

When I turned back to leave the crawlspace, I held the light in front of me, effectively blinding myself so I couldn't see anything. What I couldn't see specifically, was the corner directly right of the crawlspace. It was black. It wasn't being illuminated by the light. Curiosity took over, and I took out a flashlight from my pocket, a high powered LED light, and shined it directly into the corner. It wasn't lit up at all. Still black as night. This, being a Doctor Who fan, reminded me of Vashta Nerada (piranhas of the air) from a Series 4 episode, and I got the fuck out of there.

After that, the crawlspace has sort of freaked me out. I've not gone back in there, and I don't plan on it, and I don't even like walking by it.

Recently, however, a pipe has corroded that goes directly through the crawlspace. The landlord, Charles, called a plumber who ventured into the crawlspace to find the problem. The pipe ran through that corner that refused to accept light. When the plumber crawled in, he tried to illuminate it, also to no avail. He banged the flashlight with his hand, and it then worked. My only assumption is that whatever was there, moved. He fixed the pipe and then retreated very fast. 

After his rush of getting out of the crawlspace, I asked if he was afraid of small spaces or the dark. He said he wasn't, but something about this specific area was off and it was making him uncomfortable, as if something was watching him the entire time. He promptly left as fast as he could. 

The crawlspace door has been open since then, after the hinge breaking when the plumbers belt cracked against the hinge and bent it. 

A couple of days ago, I went to do some laundry. After putting the first load in, I ran upstairs, running past the square door as fast as I could. When all the laundry was done, I retrieved it from the dryer, and went to walk up the stairs. I swore I saw what looked like two cigarette cherries (The burning ends) in the crawlspace looking at me. I passed it off as overactive imagination, and bolted past. 

Last night however, I went to do more laundry. When the last load was retrieved yet again, the two cherries were there. Curiosity again getting the better of me, I momentarily stopped and looked back. Something drained out of me. I don't know if it was happiness, or the blood from my face, but something felt like it was taken. They then proceeded to get bigger. At first I thought it was just growing, but then realized they were coming closer to the door. I shrieked, dropped the clothes, and ran as fast as humanly fucking possible up the stairs. In true Supernatural fashion I freaked, and poured salt around the door and window of my room. I then called my roommate and asked him to get my clothes for me. 

A couple hours later, after I convinced myself I imagined it, I went to get the clothes from my roommate. He as he asked what was wrong, I told him that the dark from the crawlspace was just creeping me out. He forced the door closed. When he went to open it again, there was a terrible cry of the metal hinge being strained. He opened and closed it twice more, and the cry stayed the same. He then closed the door shut, and placed a small TV in front of the door. 

The reason I'm writing this now, with goosebumps on my arms, is that 15 minutes ago I heard that cry of the metal hinge. 

No one is home.

The house we lived in was near ancient. I don’t know how old it actually was but I know we found a buried musket in the back yard one summer. I was only eight at the time *give or take* so I saw the world accordingly. 

Now, as a kid I would have horrifying night terrors and sleep walk. Personally I think it’s because I could see shit others couldn’t and my mind didn’t know how to handle it, ultimately I’m not sure. At any rate, in this small 2.5 bedroom house my sister and I had the middle sized room with a bunk bed to sleep in. My brother had this odd add on in the back of the house that was more of a walk in closet but he said he liked it there. And of course my parents had the bedroom near the front of the house. 

One night I had what I assumed was another sleep walking episode, tho most of them I never remembered after the fact. I woke to hearing a creaking sound. By this time, I had seen some pretty crazy things and it took a lot to scare me. Tho, this creaking sounded like an old wooden rocking chair was rocking back and forth in the kitchen. Mind you I’m 8, so I just figured my mom or someone was in a rocking chair *we didn’t own one* in the kitchen for some odd reason. So, I got out of bed and went out to see what was going on. 

On my walk out, there was a glass of milk on the dining room table *just before entering the kitchen*. I bumped the table and knocked over the glass spilling a thin layer of milk over most of the table. After I did that I turned the corner to the kitchen and saw an old lady rocking back and forth in a rocking chair….. Now, I think I just figured *oh, another one of these, great…..* so I just walked over to her and asked her what she was doing. 

She replied in a normal voice and appeared normal as well “Oh, I’m just knitting this for my son, he’s due back any month now from the war….” Being 8 years old, I was interested in what this old lady had to say. By this time in my life I had already spent countless hours listening to my grandfather talk about his life and things he has experienced, so I loved just sitting and listening to older people talk. At the time, I figured this was just a dream anyway, no reason not to. 

While talking, several times in fact, my brother *whose wall was shared with the back of the kitchen* pounded on his wall knocking over some spices yelling “stop that damn noise” referring to the creaking of the rocking chair. I ignored him since it wasn’t me making the sound and chuckled at the fact he just yelled at an old lady. She and I talked for about 2 hours or so and I learned things about the Civil war that there was no way I could have known as an 8 yr old. Again, I figured this was just some dream and no biggie... 

Eventually she said I should get back to bed cause I was a youngin and “aughten to be stayin up so late”. I remember that clearly cause I thought it was funny that I knew she said that all wrong. When I woke in the morning there was dried crusty milk all over the table and my brother was pissed and asked me why I kept playing in the kitchen all night. I told my mom *who had a very clear understanding of what was going on with me* about what happened and what I was told by the lady.

My brother called me a liar, but my mom’s face nearly turned white for a moment until I told her the more friendly parts of what happened. We appeared to accept it and move on, however for weeks after that my brother got more and more upset because of the sound. Finally my mom suggested that he just ask the old lady to stop… He thought it was BS but finally did, and from that night on he never heard the creaking again.

However, behind our house was an alley and a friend of mine lived just past this alley. From his yard we had a clear view of my back door and into the kitchen. One night, I was telling him about my experience, and as kids go, he was eager to hear it and quick to dismiss it. Yet, right after talking about it, I looked over and could see the old lady rocking back and forth in her rocking chair, she turned, saw me and smiled and waved. What I didn’t know was, my friend could see her as well and by this time knew nearly my entire family. His face turned white and he screamed and ran inside his house, locked his door and told me to go away. His mother finally talked him down. 

Just an interesting and true tidbit from my childhood. I have quite a few more but most aren’t all too scary, depending on your perspective.

1311275065.0,22,self.Thetruthishere,iw32a,A Night at the DeLorean Mansion,greggerypeccary,27,5,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/iw32a/a_night_at_the_delorean_mansion/,"***This story is 100% factual and true ***

I’m sure most people have heard of the DeLorean sports car made famous in the Back to the Future movies. The car itself while very futuristic was considered a flop sale-wise and by 1985 when the first movie came out the company had already been shut down by creditors. John DeLorean personally called the filmmakers to thank them for immortalizing the car in film. If they hadn’t his name would likely have long since faded from history.

DeLorean always had issues with money and by the late 90s he was thoroughly broke. He officially declared bankruptcy in 1999 which began foreclosure proceedings on his beloved residence in Bedminster, NJ. The sprawling estate encompassed hundreds of acres of beautiful rolling hills and featured sculpture gardens, European-style fountains and a grandiose Georgian mansion.

This is where I come in. The estate was purchased at auction for $15.25 million with the intention of turning it into a golf course and country club. I happened to know someone whose parents were involved in the deal and were acting as caretakers of the estate while the sale was finalized. Somehow the parents were convinced by their children to let the kids throw a New Year’s Eve party in the mansion while it was still vacant. I arrived with a group of friends in the early evening as the mansion’s foreboding facade set a stark silhouette against the fading sunset.

The main group of people were drinking and carrying on in the dining hall for most of the night and I was bored so I decided to explore the house a little. The place had more rooms than you could count with a domed library in very imposing gothic style and scores of bedrooms tucked away down labyrinthine hallways. There was one part of the house that I seemed mysteriously drawn to, what amounted to little more than a pantry near the servant’s quarters.

That section of the house had a very strange, unsettling quality and the noise of revelers downstairs did little to assuage the dark loneliness of the space. It was simply a rectangular room with some built in shelves, nothing really noteworthy. However once I stepped inside I was flooded with emotions both inexplicable and frightening. It was a mixture of anger, desperation, regret and longing. I quickly left and shut the door. Right outside was a small nook with a window overlooking the front lawn of the house. I got the unshakable impression that someone had once sat here for many hours staring out this window.

Eventually I rejoined the party downstairs and forgot about the room. Shortly thereafter someone chimed in, “Hey, Dave is passed out! Let’s put him in the haunted pantry!” I was then brought up to speed on an alleged episode in the house’s history in which a servant had taken their life in that very room. A clearly inebriated Dave was carried up to the pantry, placed on the floor and the door was closed.

Almost immediately were heard screams and banging coming from inside and we were nearly trampled by Dave as he burst out of the door. He ran down the stairs yelling, “Dude, something touched me!!” As we were laughing at him the door abruptly shut on its own. I felt a chill permeate my bones as the group scattered trying to cover up their fright with laughter.

The rest of the party proved uneventful but we all avoided the section of the house with the pantry like the plague. In the morning after packing up my curiosity got the better of me and I walked past the pantry again. The door was slightly ajar even though no one had been to that section of the house since last night. I got the chills again and quickly made my way back downstairs. As we got in the car and were pulling away I got the distinct urge to look up at the window near the pantry. “Don’t do it,” said my cautious side and I listened.

The mansion became the main clubhouse to what is now the Trump National Golf Club and has been extensively remodeled. However I sometimes wonder what might still be living in that pantry, watching…

1376407951.0,19,self.Thetruthishere,1ka6nq,[ME] [FAM] Experiences that have happened to me and my mother,Penguinsaretheshit,25,6,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1ka6nq/me_fam_experiences_that_have_happened_to_me_and/,"After reading other peoples experiences on this subreddit, I decided to share some experiences that have happened to me and mother. I'll first start of with my experiences that happened when I lived in  London and also an experiences that happened at my grandmothers house.

I was very young and my mother and aunt were downstairs in the living room and I went upstairs to get a toy from my room. On the way I went by my sisters room and I could see her laying with her back to me in bed. I called her a few times and she wouldn't answer I assumed she was asleep and continued on to my room. Soon after I heard our dog at the time Jack start to growl and bark in my sisters room, I came out of my room and saw the dog growling at my sisters bed. My mother and aunt soon come up the stairs and I asked why the dog was growling at my sister in her bed and my mum replied that  my sister wasn't in and she had been out with my dad for the last two hours. Till this day I have no idea who was in my sisters bed.

This experience happened at my grandmothers house and I was older. I was there alone why my grandmother had just gone to the shop. In my grandmothers living room where I was she has a dog bed for her dog which was currently at the vets. I was sitting on the settee and I noticed a brown puppy sitting on the dogs bed. I didn't react out of shock and then the puppy got off the bed and ran towards the coffee table that was in the middle of the room and vanished. I got off the settee and went to look but then the brown puppy raced towards my feet and I simply jumped back on the settee and the puppy simple vanished after hitting the settee. I have no explanation for this either. Both of my experiences have never freaked me out in the long run but I simply think of it being normal experiences. 

My mother has had and still does have experiences with the paranormal happenings but one event that has all stood out in my minds is when my mum was younger and still lived at my grandmothers. My mother was babysitting and the rest of her siblings were upstairs, my mum was sitting in the kitchen reading when she heard a man voice say hello and she turned her head thinking it was my granddad and it wasn't it was a strange man. My mother screamed and the man simply vanished, her scream woke up my uncles who came down to see what happened. The looked throughout the house and found that all the doors and windows were locked and they found no man in their house. My grandmother and granddads house is said to be built on a race track ground which many people died so I don't know if it contributes to my mothers experiences living there.

I'm writing this down here because I don't really know who I can talk to about it since my friends are all a bunch of skeptics and atheists. Mind you, that doesn't put me in a different category altogether, I'm no woman of faith and I can hardly be described as a believer but after everything that's happened I can't very well deny the existence of SOMETHING, whatever that is.

I guess you could say mine was not your average family: my grandmother on my mother's side had always had the sight and, from what I'm told, also used to meddle with things better left alone, in fact freaky stuff used to happen around her. My mother had some degree of it as well, which is odd seeing how that is supposed to skip a generation. Not that I'm complaining, I think that's probably what saved me from having more of it, cause yes, I got a bit of it as well, and it's not exactly something I was wishing for.
I'll spare you the details of my rocky childhood and troubled adolescence cause I'm not sure they fit in here and it's not what you're looking for anyway, and get to the point.
From when I was born up to when I was about 12 I spent more time living with my grandma than with my mother, I loved being with her cause she was just the right mix of strict and relaxed and she made some mean chocolate milk for breakfast. She lived with my grandpa in this very big flat which I think dates back to the fourties, although I'm not completely sure since I never looked it up, anyway my grandpa was always travelling for work and was never home for more than a week at a time, so it was mostly me and grandma, and even then, I spent a big deal of time on my own cause she received people in her study and I wasn't allowed in that room. I never really knew what she did in there and not for lack of curiosity, I simply knew that asking was right out of the question.

So here's where it all starts, with me, alone, in a big flat. Most of the things I'm going to tell you were recounted to me as I have little memory of what happened when I was on my own, though I do remember everything that happened when I was with my grandma.

As most children, I used to hear my name being called throughout the place, usually in my grandpa or grandma's voice, and as most children, I was warned not to give heed to those voices. But let's face it, you're a child and hear your beloved grands calling for you, what do you do? You reach them, obviously. Doesn't matter that you're hearing your grandad's voice while you know he's far away and isn't due home for at least another week. So I spent my time chasing those voices around and occasionally scaring my grandma asking if grandpa was already home cause I heard him calling for me from the kitchen but ""there was no one there"".

Another thing that used to happen was that the adults would catch me happily chatting with seemingly nobody while looking up towards the ceiling. My mother, being herself, would interrupt me and take me away from the spot to whatever other room was farther away, while my father didn't seem very concerned about it because I had allegedly told him there was nothing to worry about because I was simply talking to ""the pretty sparkles"" and looked happy. I'm guessing my grandma's opinion on this would have maybe been nice but if they asked her for it, I never knew about it.

I've also always had this thing that dimmed with time and age where I could sort of heal people... ok, let me rephrase that, it's not that I was some sort of miraculous brat or anything, just that when someone from my family was ill or had some part of their bodies aching, I could make it better or even make it go away, depending on how bad it was. I didn't see anything wrong with it, even though I had been told not to talk about it, so I tried it with a friend of mine who had hurt herself playing, a sprained ankle or something similar, and it worked once again, so being all happy about the fact that I'd helped someone I went on telling my family about it and got scolded for it.

But I guess the time I freaked them out the most was when I was about 5, there was this very old man that my family had kind of adopted and he and I were incredibly close, had always been ever since I was born: I would imitate his voice (grunting, obviously), my first smile was for him and I would only fall asleep if he was holding me. He used to live with my grands but had to be taken to the hospital when I was around 5 because he got very ill; I was never told where he'd gone, just that he couldn't stay with us at the moment, and everyone was expecting me to react badly to the news but apparently I took it very well. Then, a couple weeks after that, I was playing with my Sailor Moon sceptre when my mom and grandma approached me saying they needed to tell me something and legend has it that I turned around and very serenely told them ""Oh, I already know, uncle has passed, but it's ok really"" with a big smile on my face and proceeded to keep on playing leaving them dumbfounded. For a while after that I kept seeing him and talking to him and everytime I would tell my family about it because I wanted them to know he was ok and was watching over me, until one day he told me he wouldn't be coming back to talk anymore, I don't really remember the reason to this but I remember it happened while I was in the car with my parents going somewhere and I was very sad about it but he was smiling so I kinda accepted it, I guess.

But that's just about where the pleasant things stop (not that chasing non corporeal voices throughout a flat is exactly what I call pleasant but it never did me any harm, so) and I needed to put them out there so you all could have some sort of background information about me.

Fast forward to the 10 year old me, just recently moved in a big semi-detached house with a huge garden sitting right at the limit of a wood (seriously, WHY MOM, WHY) with my mother and her new husband and never ever liked the place. It's the kind of place that always feels cold even when it is warm, I hated the vibe I was getting from it and would have done just about anything to not live there, unfortunately that was the period my mother decided it was maybe best if I spent more time at home with her rather than with my grandma, which meant that I was actually left to myself was once again while she slept or watched tv or did whatever it was that she did for her husband's job. 

So you get a child who is scared of the place she lives in and you add the fact that said child has been feeling followed ever since she can remember and that she can't shake off that feeling even if she's got her back against a wall. Then put in the mix the house suddenly getting chillier than usual in strange and definite spots and the child seeing things and you have my first encounter with something that I still can't quite explain.

It was a schoolday and I had just got up and had breakfast, I was leaving the kitchen to go upstairs where my room was so I could get ready for school when it happened. I was at the foot of the stairs -and man how I hated those stairs- and could see perfectly the landing. On its left side was my mother's room, with lights out and door closed, and on the right was my room with lights out and door open. And just as if it was completely normal, a hooded dark figure glided from her room to mine, effectively freezing me on the spot. I stood there, paralysed, for a good five minutes when my mother came out of the kitchen and asked what I was doing still there, I hadn't shaken off that feeling of terror yet but still tried to be rational about it (I was a weird kid, ok, I was the one who read the newspaper in the house, to say one) and asked her if her husband was home, at which I got the worst answer ever. No. He wasn't home, he'd already left for work. What the hell had I seen then? I tried telling her about it but she shrugged it off and ordered me to my room. I think that was the longest it ever took me to reach it, I was sure something horrible would happen to me once I got there and the fact that I had to get INSIDE to turn on the light didn't help, either. To my surprise, nothing happened and I didn't find anything in my room but I can't say I've been sad to move again that summer.
When I told my grandma about it, she became very serious and didn't say much, only that ""sometimes the darkness tries to scare people in the light, because by having them scared it has power over them and doesn't feel threatened anymore"". That right there and then was the moment I thought I had no want whatsoever to threaten anything and would actually do better without the ability to see anything.
But that didn't change much, strange things kept happening, accidents and seeings and some also had my friends involved.
And always, always that threatening feeling of beeing watched and followed that more than one time has had me running to ""safe spots"".
I later learned that before I was born, my grandma had chosen me as her ""heir"", to what, exactly, still isn't clear to me, but according to my mother that has never been ""completed"" (I'm sorry if that's a bit foggy but it's not something my mother liked to discuss with me when we were still on speaking terms) and I'm safe and guarded.

Now, what I'd like to know is if anyone here has any clue as to what this all could mean, if more details are needed, I will provide them as much as my memory helps me (I do have blanks), or even if anything of the sort has ever happened to anyone else.

She was an amazing lady and our entire family loved her, she was the glue that kept us together. My family is Chinese and Buddhist -- not very ""religious"" per se, a better word would be superstitious; the older generation in my family believes in spirits and the whole 49 days to heaven thing (I'm not very educated in those respects so if you want more, google is probably a good source for that), and that the spirit lingers around for 24 hours (? maybe 7 days, not too sure) and in that time frame they believe that they are still alive/come back to visit the family

After her funeral, my aunt had a small get together with our relatives that lived around her house and I went along with my parents. My brother and his girlfriend however went back to my family's house and when it was around 8 pm, I received a text from my brother asking if we were home. I responded no and asked why but didn't get a response until we got home. Just some background info, he lives in the basement right underneath the kitchen and footsteps are very audible from his room.

When we got home, he explained the reason for the text. Him and his girlfriend both heard footsteps that sounded like someone around my weight slowly walking around upstairs. I would say that me and my grandma were around the same weight.

Anyway, just wanted to share that. Pretty light stuff but I thought it was interesting.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1gxxc7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gxxc7/fam_small_encounter_with_a_spirit/,

When I was a young child I would visit my great grand mother every day after school to wait for my mom to get off work and pick me up. My mother was pretty much raised by my great grandmother so they were very close. The weird thing is almost every day I was there, a bird would fly into her window. When my grandmother who always sat in her chair by the window would notice, she would yell ""I'M NOT READY YET""  

being young I recall digging many bird graves in her garden for those poor suckers. I would ask my great grandma what she was talking about and she would explain how in the native culture they believe birds carry peoples souls to the heavens. 

A couple years go by and my parents decide to get married. My mom always told me about how since she was a young girl my grandma always wanted to see her get married and promised her she would be there to see it. My mom had a great wedding and went to Jamaica for the honeymoon, my other grand parents watched me during this time. and on my parents honeymoon my uncle came over and broke the news that my great grandmother had passed away. 

I still think about this, I don't believe in ghosts and I don't believe in heaven or hell but this always gets to me. I'm still trying to figure out how she knew she would see my mother get married and happened to pass only a couple days after the weeding.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1dzq65,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1dzq65/my_native_great_grandmother/,
1368027579.0,18,self.Thetruthishere,1dxqgq,[Me] [Dis] Encounter with an Old Irish Spirit?,Niallwithaz,23,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1dxqgq/me_dis_encounter_with_an_old_irish_spirit/,"Here's a link that may help some readers who are not familiar with Irish traditions. I'd suggest reading the story first though. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banshee
I'd love to answer any questions too.

This story happened a few years ago when I was about ten years old. I lived in a small Irish town at the time. It was a rural town that had started to grow rapidly a few years previously. The town was getting larger but there was still a country feel to it. Irish people have that catholic stereotype but it is only after you come here that you realise that our old pagan traditions still live on. n example is faerie ring forts being left undisturbed on a farmland that could be used for fear of curses and bad luck. I have always been fascinated with old Irish tales of faerie's, spirits and ghosts. 

Anyway one weekend my Dad was working days so it was just myself, my mam and my two younger siblings in the house. Just before lunch my mam had to go shopping and took my siblings with her. I was allowed stay home and play my Playstation (I think it was Crash Bandicoot) because the shop was only about a 3 minute walk away and she figured she wouldn't be too long. They left and I continued to play away in the living room. 

After a while I began to hear what sounded like someone walking in the room above the living room (my bedroom). I remember pausing the game and going into the hall to the edge of the stairs and looking up but being too afraid to actually climb them. I eventually went back to playing my game until the footsteps started again. I remember thinking that it could just be the pipes in the house or someone walking around next door (The house was semi-detached and had thin walls so you could often hear the music or tv that the house next door was using). I eventually got too much for me so I grabbed a pair of keys from the hall and went outside to play in the front garden. I think I was also afraid that a robber or axe murderer had gotten in and was going to kill me so naturally I figured going into the garden to kick a ball against a wall would keep me safe until my all-powerful Irish mammy came home to save the day.

I can recall staring at my bedroom window with morbid fascination, like one stares at a car crash or whatever. I never saw anything, but my room ( which was at the front of the house) did seem darker than it should be, like it was more ""shadowy"" or something. I was debating on whether or not I should just run down to the shops after my mam and find he there. After a while though I began getting cold (it's Ireland) hungry (10 year old boy)  and wanted to play my playstation again (Crash bandicoot!). I figured I would go back in but be on my guard and ready to run if anything happened. I think I left the front door open a bit so I wouldn't have to struggle to open it in a hurry. I also sat in the living room so that I could see it and be near it. This position meant that I could not see the top of the stairs though (which was fine by me).

After a couple of minutes the step started again and I began to freak out. Thinking back on this part makes my heart begin to race and it doesn't help that it just started lashing rain (again, it is Ireland). I recall dropping the controller and just going straight for the door. I remember being in such a hurry that I forgot to grab keys. As I was heading for the door I remember hearing steps going from my bedroom to the top of the stairs that lay behind me. These footsteps were harder and faster than the last ones. I remember them then descending the stairs at an incredible speed and hitting the stars very hard making a very loud noise as the descended. As they were descending I was busy yanking the door open and trying to get out of there as fast as possible. 

As I went through the door and was about to slam it shut it the steps reached the end of the stairs and it felt like they were coming for me. I managed to get the door shut before anything reached me but it felt like I had just managed to escape from something. Exactly what I wasn't sure. I never looked up the stairs to see what was coming for me but I remember seeing a black figure on the bottom step for a split second. It wasn't a shadow person, more like a figure wrapped in black and dark grey bed sheets, if you get me? But this may just be my imagination or my mind and memory playing tricks on me as I recall the story years later. 

Anyways, I ran down the road to the shops never looking back behind me, especially not as I left the house. I eventually met my mam about halfway up the road as she was walking home. I didn't tell her what had happened, just that I was playing football out the front and had forgotten keys so had come to find her. She must have known something was up though cause I was absolutely terrified. We got back to the house and she went in and saw there was nothing up. After checking around upstairs (With a new found bravery now that my mam was home) I went back to my game and tried to forget what had happened.  Now the story could end here and I would think maybe I saw a ghost or maybe I was involved in a robbery gone wrong. But the next part really freaks me out.

 Later that day my mam calls me into the kitchen and asks me to sit down. She goes on to tell me that one of my friends dad's, who was part of a family that lived a few houses down and was very close to my own family, had died suddenly of a heart attack that day. She tells me that it happened at about lunch time. At this point I remember having an odd feeling about what had happened earlier but was too sad to connect the two events until a few years later, when myself and a few friends were discussing ghost stories and legends, I thought back to this day and I realised that maybe that day I had seen a herald of death, a banshee. The steps came at me about the time that my friends father would have passed or just before. I'm not sure what happened that day but when people ask for a true ghost story I recall that story as one where I had a visit from the legendary banshee.

**Some relavant background information:**
My family (mom’s side) has always been pretty spiritually intuitive, they are Buddhist and believe in an afterlife as well as a spiritual world in existence parallel to our living world. My mom does not lie about any paranormal experiences she witnesses. She believes to lie about such things is essentially mocking the spiritual world and inviting bad luck and misfortune to fall on you and your loved ones.

This story takes place at my aunt’s house, whom I will be calling Vanessa.  Vanessa’s house was actually a newly built home in a new subdivision. She moved in a couple years after the subdivision was built and the previous owners left. I used to hang out at her house with my cousins very frequently in my younger years, and ended up living there for around 4 years when I got out of high school. My grandma lived with my other aunt and uncle, Lan and Dan, in the same subdivision just a couple houses down the street.  Every weekend the family would gather at both houses, eating and drinking until it was Monday. I’ve spent a great deal of time in that house but when you’re there with a large family gathering, it’s hard to pick up on the strange vibes/occurrences that normally happen.  Anyway, I will finally get on with the story!


I was living at my aunt’s house at the time, and I must have been around 18-19 years old. My room was the den room, there was no door and I did not set up any curtains. The style of this house was vast and open, there were no doorways and everything connected together revealing enormous space. If you walked up to the front door from the outside, you would see two very tall windows on either side of the door. Once you walk through the door, my room, the den, would be on the right. Immediately in front was a wide column that was actually a closet. To the left and further past this closet was the entire living room that melded into the kitchen and dining room.


As I mentioned earlier, my family loves to get together on weekends. One night, I fell asleep watching TV on the couch in the living room. The previous night my mom and aunts had all been out at the casino and didn’t arrive home until sometime around 4-5am, I remember waking up briefly hearing the front door slam close. A couple hours later I woke up again to hear the same sound, I thought my mom had left to go to Lan’s house down the street. Later that day she would tell me what actually happened when I was woken up by that second slam.


My mom said she had come home to Vanessa’s house around 4:30am. She saw that I had fallen asleep on the couch so she took the liberty of sleeping in my bed in my room. Vanessa and my other aunt Mai went to Vanessa’s bedroom to sleep. My mom woke up around 7:30am because she heard the front door close. This was the same time I woke up thinking it was my mom leaving. She said she got up because she thought Mai was going to Lan’s house down the street and she wanted to join her to get coffee and talk. When my mom looked out the window she saw Mai walking down the sidewalk and turn the corner towards the driveway. My mom went to Vanessa’s room wanting to wake her up to see if she wanted to join everyone at my grandma’s for coffee. When she opened the door, she saw both Vanessa and Mai sound asleep in bed. Naturally, she began to retrace what happened in her mind. She woke up to the door slamming because she thought Mai had left. She did in fact, see her long black hair and her body shape walking down the sidewalk. But then, how was she staring at Mai right now?


My mom called my grandma to ask if any of her other sisters stopped by Vanessa’s house to maybe pick something up but my grandma informed her she was the only one awake in the house since 6am. My mom Vanessa what happened but she appeared to not believe her. I think she was secretly terrified because that same day she went out to purchase curtains and draped them over the two windows at the front door so you couldn’t see out them.


As I mentioned earlier, was always over Vanessa’s house but I didn’t notice how unsettling and often times even threatening that place was until I started living there. I havemany psychologically and physically frightening stories from that house that come from first-hand experience as well as recounted stories from my family and friends. If you guys want, I would be more than happy to share more stories here (:.

I'm a resident of rural, backwoods Georgia, and I have been considered a sensitive by many people I have encountered. That's all well and good until you get a grandmother who is a genealogist and loves to go investigating around cemeteries looking for the headstones of long-lost relatives. 

There's a small cemetery in Taliaferro County, and it is the lone testament to the former town of Locust Grove, Ga. The cemetery was founded in 1790 and the last burial was in 1874. It is the oldest Catholic cemetery in the state of Georgia. Rumors say that, back in the day, the settlers of the town had a few inclement run-ins with the natives and lots of blood was shed. There is little to substantiate these claims, but where would we be without stories? Anyway, at the top of this cemetery, there is a granite podium that serves as a commemorative decoration to one of the men buried there. His name and a little blurb about his life are engraved in the top of the podium.

On my last visit there, my grandmother refused to enter inside the low-lying rock wall surrounding the graves. I said a prayer over both of us and I entered, looking for the remnants of the grave of a deceased relative. As I approached the podium (you have to walk past it to get to most of the graves), I got hit with an overwhelming sense of panic. I also got the impression of a name starting with ""Th."" It was either Thomas or Timothy. I steadied myself and kept walking towards the bottom of the cemetery. I hurriedly looked at all of the grave markers, and failed to find the name we were looking for. Right as I was about to leave, I felt drawn to the bottom of the hill. Against my better judgement, I investigated, and found a series of sunken graves, all unmarked and overgrown. The feeling I got there was comforting, not nearly as panicked as the rest of the graves. I felt almost at home there. 

On my way out, I decided to take a closer look at the memorial at the top of the hill. I noticed that there was a 3 foot bald area around the base (it was the end of spring, and everything else was generously covered with grass), and that the memorial was tilted off to the left, perpendicular to the writing on it (which I found odd). I brushed my hand along the top of the granite and I was rushed with the face of a man with a gaping mouth. I jumped, obviously startled, and left in a hustle. As we drove away, I could not help but be bothered by the event, and the word ""altar"" kept coming to mind. 

I know that witchcraft is often misrepresented, but still practiced, and this cemetery would be ideal if you wanted no attention, as it is miles away from everything but trees. I know very little about the subject, besides classical Judeo-Christian demonology.  Does anyone know anything about this graveyard? Here are a few links for more info.

As a side note, I have had a multitude of run-ins with a variety of spirits, and two demons.

I don't think it could be written shortly. So, here it goes:

There is a national recreation area in Western Kentucky (that also runs down to Tennessee) called 'Land Between the Lakes', or LBL for short. It is situated between the Kentucky and Barklay Lakes, consisting of more then 300 miles of shoreline, 170,000 acres of forest and over 200 miles of walking trails. It is currently a focal point for over $600 million in the tourism industry. Prior to 1959, before the Kentucky and Lake Barklay Dams were constructed, and before it was officially called LBL (in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy), and before TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority, the federal government used it's powers of eminent domain to buy and tear down all the houses, businesses and community buildings thru out the entire area, forcing over 700 families to give up their homes.) took over the land, the area was called 'Between the Rivers'.

There are over 228 small family cemeteries, many forgotten about and lost, dotted thru out the acres of forests as it was once used as homes to early Kentucky settlers. Some of the earliest graves date back to the early 1700's, which include graves of white settlers, veterans from nearly every war, including the Revolutionary War, and also those of black slaves and Chinese immigrants who worked in the iron furnaces that were in the area. There was also a very high infant mortality rate and many of these children were buried right outside the cabins from where they were born so that their mother could peer out the window and see the grave. There are also numerous Native American graves scattered thru out the acres, much older then even the earliest of settler graves, some discovered, others lay in secret beneath the layers of leaves and forest ferns.

Back before the 1950's it always had been a very rural area to live in, with farmsteads far and few between, and with no real town to speak of except up at the north end in Grand Rivers. It was in this town, back in the mid 80's that I first heard of 'The Beast Between the Rivers' or known now as 'The Beast of LBL'. Some old timers would sit on this long wooden bench outside the old IGA store, that use to be the old 'country store' for decades before the grocery conglomerate came to town. I used to hang around there on the weekends during the day and listen to the stories they each would tell. These old men, most of whom used to live in LBL before they were forced to move, had some very interesting stories to tell about that part of the country.

There was talk of hauntings, Indian curses, mysterious lights over gravestones at night, old hag witches that lived deep in the woods, and more importantly, several tales of a wolf like creature that stood on two legs that would come out of the thickets and attack their cattle and live stock. Day or night. A creature that was taller then an average man by well over a foot, nearly 7 foot tall, with thick long hair covering it's body, and a stench that matched that of some of the freshly open graves that were discovered now and then. This 'wolf man' left tracks like a barefoot man but where the toes should have been, instead were paw prints. The head was huge and wolf like in appearance, with an extra long snout, and uncanny long sharp incisors along with eyes that, ""Radiated red, like one of the hottest fires in Hell', they'd say. It had long arms that ended with huge hands and long spindly fingers with long, pointed, dirt caked claws. At night they would hear it howl; un-natural guttural sounds of painful hungry agony, and at that warning, all would go out and tie up their livestock and even bring their most prized selections inside their homes with them. The legend of the beast went back at least a hundred years, and was passed along through time from family to family and updated as new sightings occurred.

The sightings of the monster where still frequent thru out the beginning of the twentieth century, and the elderly group on the bench each told some unsettling encounters they or members of their own families had had with it. Each one told stories of finding livestock slaughtered, ripped to pieces and ate upon. Cows and pigs with their legs dismembered from the sockets. Even a few horses had met their end with savage attacks upon their bodies. A few of them described what they saw at different times when they caught glimpses of the figure by peeking out of the curtains of the windows into the night. One man said it jumped out of one of the horse stalls one evening while he was putting up some animals. It stopped in front of him, arms spread out like it was getting ready to grab him, let out a howl and then sprang past him and into the dusky shadows of the sunset. This particular man said he 'wet his overalls' during the episode. Another man said he never seen it, but would always hear it's baleful wails frequently at night, not like a regular wolf or a coyote, ""No,"" he said, ""It was more deeper, longer, stronger sounding then what would come out of any animal I ever heard."" Another old timer said his wife had seen it trying to get into the chicken coup but gave up after getting tangled in the chicken wire. They all had tales of 'someone's hound dog' getting killed, ripped apart limb from limb, 'someone's pig or cow or chicken' getting eaten, the mysterious footprints left in the mud, and the stench it left behind where ever it appeared. And more then one had the same story of listening to it walk across their front porches at night and scratching on the doors and walls which would leave deep gouges in the wood they would find in the morning. All of them agreed that this was not a Bigfoot or Sasquatch. It would be only another year or two after hearing about this mysterious beast that I myself would encounter it at the home of a family member that lived in the same area.

But this isn't the story I was wanting to tell you. This was just a brief introduction to the unwritten accounts of the darker side of LBL. A prelude actually to the real story I will begin to unfold. I just wanted to lay some ground work so you could get the big picture, and form some of your own opinions and theories.

The summer of '88 will always be a turn about in my beliefs of 'real monsters' versus the demonic or paranormal type, when a new avenue of fear introduced itself and made a permanent pathway inside my mind. A path made of concrete that wanders thru the forests of my memories. A trail that will not be covered with weeds, or fade with time. A place where my daily thinking bypasses to avoid the beckoning desire of fear that calls from down that menacing road of remembrance. For this moment though, for the benefit of you, the reader, I will travel down that route once more and try to recapture the scene so that you too will lay awake wondering and asking the Universe, ""Is there something else out there somewhere that is above us humans on the food chain?"" 

It was on one of those hot July summer evenings in Grand Rivers, Kentucky, back in 1988, when this took place. (Grand Rivers is at the beginning of Land Between the Lakes entrance.) The sun was not completely down and the skies were streaked with violet-pinkish Posy colored clouds that outlined the curtain of darkness that was pushing the turquoise blue away. I was staying at my Aunts house with my cousins for a few weeks during summer vacation, a very welcome home at the end of a dead end road. Hundreds of acres of woods surrounded the home that had been built down a hill and into the side of a large hill of dirt.

There were several homemade trails through out the woods that led to several places; an old abandoned rail road track that went on for miles, another abandoned place-the old sawmill, and other paths led to parts of the shore line of the Kentucky lake. They all started out as walking trails, but with the new addition of a dirt bike that my cousin Joe had the trails became well outlined and defined. As with almost every day that I was visiting, Joe was out riding his bike through the woods, exploring, and just being with his own thoughts of a 15 year old. His younger sister, Ronda, was with me outside on the porch swing. She was 10, and I was 13 at the time. My uncle was working and my aunt was at the local IGA store down in town. Beside the driveway was a huge dog pen where their pet basset hounds lodged and was at the moment quite relaxed in the shade. The woods had been filled with only the sounds of birds and the chatter of squirrels for a few hours. Joe must have been way far off on a trail somewhere to not have heard that distinct sound of the dirt bike screaming through it's gears echoing around the trees. I knew he must be on his way home, because his dad forbid him to be out in the woods at dark, so Ronda and I was waiting to hear that familiar putt putting of the bike slowly coming down the drive as he reluctantly came home to park it for another night.

As we swung back and forth, we heard something a bit strange in the distance, it was Joe's dirt bike screaming at almost a soprano type of gear, long, steady, and fast, with no shifting sounds, just a straight stream of one gear in motion with a full throttle, going at top speed. The sound accelerated as he drew closer at such a fast pace, and we watched from the swing up to the top of the driveway where he would appear from the other side out of the woods. I couldn't help but think that he had better slow down or he would come flying up over the top of the hill and downwards missing a wide stretch of pavement by being airborne. The noise didn't softened or slow. Steady and fixed was his speed. And just as I had thought, he emerged from the woods in such a tenacious movement, that he did indeed go airborne a few feet before pounding down the front tire on the driveway, continuing his descent now with a struggle of keeping the bike upright and straight. Ronda and I jumped from the porch swing and got out of the way as we didn't know where he was going to stop or in what position. The brakes hit hard and the bike slid sideways and as it came down to the edge and end of the drive, Joe tilted his body and let the bike slide out from under him before he went down the rest of the hill with it. Instead of the bike continuing to slide to the edge it was caught in a spin that variably died down as the engine sputtered, and then quit altogether. Everyone was wide eyed and full of adrenaline, all our mouths open in shock. But Joe's mouth was open in a strange fearful grimace, he was sweating profusely and his breaths were coming and going in great heaves. Tears were coming down his cheeks, mixing with the dusty dirt that the trail had left him powdered with. His eyes were at the top of the hill, at the top of the drive, unblinking, searching, waiting. We followed his gaze not understanding what this escapade was all about. In silence we watched with him for a about 30 seconds and then the dogs started barking. Growling. And then whining, trying to get out of the pen in a frantic panic of digging and gnawing at the fencing.

""IT GRABBED ME!! LOOK AT MY LEG!!"", Joe screamed, making us jump with alarm at the sound of his voice. We looked down at his Levi's and saw scratch marks going across his right thigh, scratches that tore through the tough denim and left small bloody marks on his skin. The marks were like a bears-claw-rake, not those caused by branches or sticky bushes, but a definite wide pattern of a paw print. ""IT WALKED ON TWO LEGS!"", his voice startled us again, as he was trying to tell his story in between huge gulps of air. He was frightened beyond belief, and the bits and pieces of what he was striving with extreme effort to tell us was coming out in loud syllables that filled us both with the same dread. ""It was following me through the woods....along the path....from the old sawmill....hairy...it was so hairy...and it's snout was so long...and it walked on two legs....it ran on two legs..."", his voice was sputtering, slowing, his eyes were still wide, and I could see the pulse of his heartbeat throbbing under the skin of his temples.

A howling began. From the woods, not from the dog pen where now the dogs suddenly stopped their own complaining, standing deathly still, staring up at the top of the hill, the nape of the hair on their back standing up, ruffled, their noses up in the air breathing in a strange scent. Then, a wolfs howl. It was close. It seemed it was just a few yards from the road up above. Just as the idiot in a horror movie stands and stares at something to appear, that was what I was doing then, with a mixture of anticipation and confusion. What the hell was he talking about? I thought to myself, mulling over the brief descriptions; torn blue jeans, walks and runs on two legs, stalking him, hairy with a long nose and calling the mysterious hunter an ""IT"". Joe's tears came quicker and he started to push us towards the front door of the house demanding that we go inside and lock the doors. He had a hand on each of our backs and was urging us onward when IT came out of the woods above. At first it appeared to be a very large wolf emerging from the dark outline of the trees, but as it approached the one lane road that connected to the driveway, it's height grew to a towering shadow that stood on two legs. Much taller then a man's height, maybe by a foot, and with the sun gone down behind the clouds, it only cast a silhouette of blackness, hairy blackness. My mouth dropped wide as well as my eyes. This was not happening, this was not what I was seeing. My mind was going back and forth from rationality to reality. 'I was from Missouri, the most frightening thing back home in Missouri was MO MO the Monster, the Show Me States version of Big Foot. This was no Big Foot!'

It raised it's long snout up in the air and let out a gurgling, slow, deliberate howl. At that moment the security light that was at the top of the hill by the beginning of their driveway popped on. Slowly at first it began to glow and gathered it's energy to shine more brightly over the next few seconds. One of the creatures arms bent and shaded it's eyes from the glare. It wasn't an 'It' any longer, nor was it a big foot, this was a wolf like creature that, like Joe said, stood on two legs, was taller then a man, and was staring at the three of us down the hill. Those huge, black eyes, I will never get out of my mind. They were like two sockets of ebony oil shining under magnifying glass lenses. We ran into the house, tearing the screen door in the process, slamming the main door, locking it, pushing things, anything we could reach against the inside of the door. The kitchen was right behind us and so was the knife drawer which we raided and took several with us as we tried to decide where to hide. There was a house dog inside, another basset hound, Stubby, and he met us in the kitchen wondering what the racket was. Another howl from outside, coming from the driveway. Stubby's hair raised and he started backing up at first, then he went to the front door and was smelling around the edges. The three of us ran to my aunts room and was about to slam the door and lock it when the dog tucked tail and ran after us, beating us under the bed. All of us squeezed under the four poster, knives clutched in our hands, scared half to death.

We could hear the dogs in the pen outside going absolutely crazy with barking, and we could also hear other things being knocked around on the porch, then on the side of the house, then at the side door. We heard glass break. We could tell it was from one of the bedrooms, the windows were up high and they were very narrow so we knew that it would take some effort for anything to get thru them, but still we shivered from fright. Then my aunts horn on her Cadillac sounded several times as she drove down the road and approached the house. That meant for us to meet her outside and help with the groceries. We didn't budge. We couldn't move. We didn't answer her yells from outside for us to come unload the bags, we didn't crawl out and unlock the door for her, nor answer her knocking. She finally had to use her keys and then give some hefty push's against the pile of items we had up against the door; the trash can, 25 pound bags of dog food, water jugs, and a variety of other stuff. We stayed put. She discovered us only after all the groceries had been brought in and she noticed that her bedroom door was closed and locked.

It was amazing that we hadn't cut each other in some way or another with the immature use of the knives in our haste to hide, and we were chastised in more ways then one when it came down to my aunt observing us slowly emerging from her bedroom with the kitchen weapons in hand. We all started talking at once in a fervor, then we finally let Joe tell his story first, then we finished with it breaking a window just before we heard her horn on the car. She must have startled it. She didn't laugh, she didn't respond at all at first, in fact she never said a word until she came back from inspecting the windows in the bedrooms. My aunt said indeed there was a broken window, broken from the outside in. She made us clean up our barricade and put up all the groceries. Later that night, after we were all in bed and my uncle came home, she related that evenings events to him. The next morning, their dad warned us, ""Stay out of the woods.""

No problem.

He went on to say that he himself had went down in the woods earlier that morning and found several pits dug and filled with animal bones and parts of carcasses along the path that led to the old sawmill that couldn't be explained. There were also holes dug in the sides of the bluff along the hills that over-looked the old mill that looked like deep caves, big enough for a man to hide in. Then he told us that years before when the old boy scout camp use to be on the other side of Grand Rivers, that an unexplained creature with wolf features was seen along the waters edge close to the camp sites. He and his older son had witnessed it themselves one evening. I went back home a few weeks after this happened. And since then it has never ceased to be a moment of complete terror lodged inside my mind.

Not to awful long ago, in the late '90's, my uncle and my dad who had come down from Missouri to visit, decided to venture into those same woods in front of my aunts house. They took a couple of pistols and two rifles and were gone for several hours. These were two brave men, the bravest I know of, both of whom served in the military and fought in wartime. These two men came back ashen faced and bewildered. They had walked all the way back to the old saw mill. The pits, fresh ones, were still around, filled with the bones of forest animals. The holes in the bluff still there also. They both experienced the feeling of being watched and felt an uneasiness that 'something' just wasn't right. The area where the sawmill was had no life stirring around it. No birds, no squirrels, no crickets, no bugs, even the small pond was still and lifeless. They couldn't shake the feeling of being observed by a secret watcher and both swore they saw a large black shadow lurking in the shade of one of the mysteriously dug caves. That had been the first time they had been down that far on that side of the woods in many years, and both of them agreed that it was to be the last. My dad said there are some things you just can't explain, that science doesn't know about it, and these things should be left alone, they are not a part of our modern world. He felt that what ever it was that had scared the shit out of us so many years ago, still existed in the same area. His intuition has never been wrong so far.

Urban legend? Maybe some of the stories passed along the years have been added too, stretched a bit, like all local folk lore, and first hand stories are over time. My story wasn't an urban tale though. It was a first hand account of something I really and truly do not want to believe in, and wish I could forget; erase from my memory, because the nightmarish image remains real even though the events are still unexplainable by the laws of science as we know it.

Edit: Spelling errors

Edit: I apologize for my writing style. It may seem to descriptive, or perhaps too thought out and fictional, according to some redditers. This happened over 20 years ago and I have had a lot of time to think about it and mull over every detail. Not like something that happened yesterday and I am still struggling to deal with and make sense of what happened. I remember every detail and tried to paint as vivid of a picture as possible and capture the complete feeling as I remember it. I apologize if anyone feels I have posted this in the wrong subreddit. I have told this tale on various other sites over the years. I understand its a tall tale. But, this is the truth. It happened, and I know its real. I know its unbelievable, but I will take it to my grave as truth. Thank you for reading. :-)

1359046655.0,20,self.Thetruthishere,17742o,[ME] Doomsday in a Tree,keeks137,23,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/17742o/me_doomsday_in_a_tree/,"I moved to the suburbs of Chicago at age 8 or 9, which was an exciting move. This street had kids my own age, which was lacking at my previous house.

Long story short, I became pretty good friends with five or six kids on the street. Most of them had known each other for a handful of years prior to my arrival, and thus had stories that predated me showing up.

One of the stories was of the infamous DOOMSDAY SAWS!!! I write it like that, because that's exactly how I heard it at the time: dark, ominous, but way too overblown to actually be believed. The story goes that there were two separate instances in which one of the kids from the block found a saw with the word ""Doomsday"" scratched into the wooden handle. In both instances the saw was found in a fairly random location, I believe tossed in a bush or something to that effect.

That's essentially where their stories would end. It was brought up as a fairly creepy thing that occurred, but it wasn't the center of anyone's existence. Like I already indicated, I just brushed the story off as a legend among the original occupants of the street, and didn't give it a second thought. 

Fast forward to my time in the neighborhood. We would play your normal assortment of games, several of which involved hiding. One of the more popular places to hide was this strange Evergreen. It seemed to be a combination of a tree and some bushes, but the cool thing for us kids about it was the fact that you could sit inside it all. Once you pushed some of the branches aside and stepped in, you (and about 3 or 4 other people) could sit comfortably on the pine needle floor while you were surrounded by the branches, unseen from the outside. 

The other odd bit about the tree was that there was a flag pole sticking straight up through it. (EDIT: [Holy crap, they've Streetview'd my old street and I got a great picture of the tree](http://i.imgur.com/ZvlR8nq.jpg?1)). Inside the tree, tied to the flagpole, was this thin white rope that disappeared into the ground. The rope was pulled taut.

We occasionally would discuss the rope, but one day our curiosity must have gotten the better of us. We dared each other to dig it up. A lot of us were too skittish to go forward with it but one kid agreed. The rest of us left the tree, and our braver friend returned with a spade. 

Ten minutes later he was walking back towards us looking visibly shaken with something in his hands. It was a saw. 

He told us that he dug for a bit, but didn't have to dig too deeply. Eventually he hit the other end of the rope, which was tied to a couple of black garbage bags. He couldn't be sure what was inside the bags, but it smelled a bit like well... shit. I can confirm the smell, we all went back and saw the hole that was dug up and the bags. There was definitely a smell about it as if you had stepped in a stray dog dropping.

The most interesting item was the saw. I know some people here will think that he faked it and brought the saw with him, but he would have had to be a genius 9 year old. The saw was rotted and incredibly damp. The wooden handle had a texture that suggested if I were to twist my hands, I could have broken the worn down piece of wood in two. It was definitely consistent with something that would have been buried in that location for years. I don't believe there was anything ominous scratched into the handle to follow the same vein of stories that were told to me when I first moved there, but the pattern always struck me as bizarre.

We eventually showed the saw to our parents, who suggested getting rid of it. They obviously didn't want a rusty old saw in the hands of their kids, which makes sense. I believe all of us tried to relate the story to our parents, but they just kind of shrugged it off. We were ""just being kids."" Truth be told we all eventually just forgot about it and moved on. Yet, it doesn't feel like I've moved on 100%. I'm sure it's common to look back on your childhood and remember numerous instances in which you were embellishing situations or letting your imagination run away with you. But, this actually happened. I'm not making this up. I still don't have an explanation for it, and that is always going to bug me in the back of my head.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_17742o,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/17742o/me_doomsday_in_a_tree/,

The two girls were around 9 and 13, and the father was probably mid-to-late twenties around the time. I've spoke to them all about it, in passing, but they don't seem to recall exact locations. Still, an eerie and interesting enough story that I think it's worth telling.

My fiancee and her sister and father were all hiking in a fairly remote area, which was apparently the site of an old town. Obviously it wasn't extremely remote, no more than what a casual hiker and his youngish daughters, but enough that meeting fellow hikers was rare. As they hiked they reached a cliff, where they could look out and see a path. They stood and watched, observing a non-detailed figure (i.e., the silhouette was clear, details were not) standing on one side of the path. The silhouette looked like an old woman, hunched, long hair, etc. The figure slowly crossed the path, slowly enough that they all were all able to stop and watch, and then promptly vanished upon reaching the other side. They were not compelled to talk about it at the time, but my fiancee recalls looking to the others and seeing them flabbergasted. Later, they all recalled the incident with varying degrees of clarity (it seemed the youngest sister recalled the incident least).

Not the most exciting story in the world, but I thought it was an interesting little tale. For more information, this probably happened around the early 00's, in Oregon. I could press my fiancee for more details, but she's asleep right now, and I'd be surprised if she remembers anymore than what I've wrote.

1352408218.0,20,self.Thetruthishere,12vjtv,[ME] One of my first encounters: Haunted Car,hoonthatsc,23,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/12vjtv/me_one_of_my_first_encounters_haunted_car/,"Hey guys, first paranormal post I've ever done. I have had quite a few experiences over the years, but this one has always stood out as the creepiest thing that has happened to me. 
So I'm a huge car guy, and I was lucky enough to score a job as a shop hand at a premier hot rod shop in Texas about two summers ago (I was 20 yrs old). I loved the work, It let me deal directly with old cars, primarily muscle cars and beat up hot rods. The way the shop was set up is that there were about 6 or 7 ""storefronts"", which were 10 ft wide by ~20ft tall warehouse bays that had a normal door in the front, and garage door in the back. Make sense? I was in charge of cleaning, part recovery (basically getting parts off shelves) and any other sort of bitch work. One afternoon, I was in the main parts bay that housed an old 1974 El Camino in the front, about 6 ft away from the front glass door. I was sweeping out the bay when I heard my manager call me out to the large lot that the bays backed up to. I walk out into the blistering Texas summer sun, and immediately get absolute chills when I lay eyes on a beat-to hell '65 Bel-Air being lowered off of a flat-bed. Since I was little, I have been sensitive to ""energies"" and ""presences"" that my mom has felt as well. My dad always dismisses these ""I dont like this"" feelings as nothing, but my mother, who experiences similar sensations, listens and is sympathetic when I am unnerved by a particular object or location. I have an aversion to 'dead"" energy, I.e stale rooms, offputting houses and locations, but rarely does that extend to objects such as cars or furniture. The fact that it was so instantaneous rattled me down to my very core. I, along with a few of my work buddies, had to push the Bel-Air into the bay where the El Camino lay. It fit in right behind the El Camino, about 7 FT from the garage door. I immediately was called back into the shop for other duties. I quickly forgot about the extreme unease I had around the car, and went home for the night undaunted. 
The next morning, I was tasked with gathering a few parts for the '32 Ford we were working on. I unlocked the door to the parts bay, and went inside. Once again, I was struck with chills and unease as I ventured inside. The air was COMPLETELY stale. It did not have a bad smell, it just felt....old. I quickly walked around the El Camino to grab a ladder for the shelves. As I passed the Bel-Air, my leg brushed the door. It was cool, if not slightly cold, to the touch. This was in a room that was lit by sunlights in 110 degree Texas heat. I backpedaled and grabbed the EL Camino. Noticeably warm to the touch. The Triumph motorcycle in the back? Warm. Bel-Air? Cold. It remained cold throughout the entire time we housed it. This is where things started to get weird. Over the course of two weeks, I was cut 7 times on various locations around the Bel-Air. I have NEVER been cut by ANY vehicles on the premise before, and the Bel-Air was easily passable in the warehouse. I would brush up against the Bel-Air, and would usually come away with a shallow gash or scrape from some unseen shard of metal. 
I could brush all of this as simply cold spots, my stupid nerves, or some sort of gross dust or mold from the car, until I experienced one horrific event as I was closing up the shop three weeks after we got the car. (No work was ever done on it, it was hard to find parts). I was making sure all of the doors were closed and locked for the night, as I had stayed late to work on my Beetle. I went to check the parts room, and  the door was securely locked. Keep in mind it ONLY locks from the outside, so I can dismiss co-worker involvement. As I turned to walk away from the warehouse, I hear a slight scuffle on the papered over windows. Thinking it was a rat or mouse, I opened the absolutely pitch black room, hoping to scare away whatever it was. Immediately, a loud, older female voice chillingly shouted, ""DON'T. DON'T. GO. DON'T"" I flipped the absolute **** out, as my ""senses"" went haywire. I locked the door and sprinted back to my car and flew about 90 the whole trip home, with a sleepless night spent in bed.
The next day, the car was gone. THE END
Just kidding, the manager got rid of it at about 8 AM because the owner was sick of the lack of work being done to it. Still, I have never in my entire life had such a creepy experience. Hopefully this wasn't too boring or long, It felt good to share.

I sat up again and reached for my knife under my pillow beside me (paranoid as I am as I was also alone in the house and have no pets.) then I left my room and walked around downstairs. Nothing. I returned to bed satisfied I was just imagining things. I slept another 30 minutes probably and got this chilling feeling on my spine despite having the heat up and a blanket on. I slowly opened my eyes and rolled over onto my other side and on the side of my bed was a featureless shadow silhouette static outlined figure with both hands raised above me fingers drooped downward as if warming them over a fire. I was in shock because it was not human looking, although it did have the frame and figure of a man. Within roughly 4 seconds and I mean 4 seconds, it dropped its arms turned around and frame by frame walked into the darkness of my bathrooms open door; and disappeared. I jumped up and ran after it flipping on the light and nothing. To this day I know what I saw and have no decent explanations for it. Perhaps a state between dreaming and wakefulness?

That's the house, luckily my dad and his dog weren't home at the time, so they're okay.

Before I showed up, my dad, two of my sisters, my sisters boyfriend, and my dads ex wife went inside to check it out. While they were in there, my dad was looking into his room, and he heard the song ""Love will keep us together"" By Captain &amp; Tenille playing from inside somewhere. There was no electricity in the house, and any radio that could have been playing it was burnt up. The song played twice in there that they know of, but then they left. I think it was my grandma, who passed away a few years ago. My dad lost a lot of sentimental things in there, like my grandmas old recipes, some of my grandmas old things, my great gradndfathers ring, and other things he's kept for years. I don't know if it was a warning, because the first part of the song they heard playing was ""Just stop, 'cause I really love you"" Or if it was her trying to cheer my dad up.

1350257177.0,21,self.Thetruthishere,11hf4h,[Me] Jim,SoulWhisperer99,26,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/11hf4h/me_jim/,"I've never posted here before or told many people about my encounters with the supernatural for that matter but after being introduced to Reddit by a good friend I've decided to share my experiences with the truth is here community. Although this particular encounter was not my first, it has been one of the most terrifying things that I have ever experienced so I figure it’s a good one to start with.

I’m in my sophomore year at one of the local high schools in my small city and I've had experiences with the supernatural for as long as I can remember. I know that some of you will instantly assume that I’m schizophrenic but oddly enough the majority of my experiences have taken place when other people have been around and I have never been the only person to see or hear what had happened. 

Sadly however, this experience was one that I had to face alone.
 
This experience took place during my freshman year of high school. It was around 5 in the morning and after getting ready for school I went downstairs to finish my French essay which was due that day. I wasn't usually awake this early but after having a long peaceful night’s sleep I was full of energy so I decided it would be best to do something productive. My house was deathly quiet as the rest of my family wouldn't be getting up for at least another hour so I tried my best to be quiet. I had been at the desk in my living room typing for about half an hour when I heard the kitchen cupboards slamming and someone rapidly walking around on the tile floor. Right away I figured that it was my older brother, I found it unusual that I hadn't heard him come upstairs since he was always rather noisy but I just brushed it off and pushed back my chair so I could see into the kitchen. I was about to scold him for making such a racket when I realized that the man who I was looking at was not my brother. An overwhelming feeling of terror came over at me as I stared at the man who held my gaze. He looked to be in his thirties; he faced me with wild bloodshot eyes and a wide psychotic grin. He was a tall man with short messy hair; I don’t remember much else because I was too terrified by what he was holding. In his right hand he held my mom’s largest kitchen knife; his arm was raised and ready to strike. My heart felt like it had stopped beating and I opened my mouth to scream but I was too paralyzed by my fear. I knew that I had to do something but a small teenage girl wasn't much of a match for an armed man. Frantically I looked at my desk for some kind of weapon but it had nothing but my laptop, I glanced back towards the kitchen to see that the man was gone. I had only taken my eyes off of him for a second yet he had vanished. That floor in my house is an open lay out and the only way he could have escaped would have been by running out of the glass door that leads to the patio or by going down the stairs I was sitting by to exit through the front door, other than that the only other option would be to break a window. The windows were intact and it wasn't humanly possible to escape any other way in that short amount of time. My blood was pounding as I sprinted up to my room no longer caring whose sleep I disturbed. I slammed my door behind me and jumped onto my bed wrapping myself in the safety of my quilt. I stayed there shaking with fear until it was time for me to get the bus.

 I didn't talk to anyone in school that day and when my French teacher asked why my essay I had a feeling that my experience wouldn't qualify as a valid reason in her books. 

I have not seen that man again. I have named him Jim because I figured that by giving him a non-sinister name it might make him a little easier to talk about. To this day the only people who know about Jim are my best friend Danielle who has shared many supernatural experiences with me and now all of you in the Reddit community. I will post some more of my experiences soon if you care to hear about them.

(like the attic, the hall, the wood floors, etc.)

Not sure what to do, but interesting and creepy stuff has been happening in our house lately. My home was built in 1870 and we've been living in it since 2004. We've never had major paranormal activity, just the usual thuds, creaks and old house sounds. We've renovated bathrooms, added a pool, painted, plastered, moved stuff, and nothing has changed... until we messed with the attic.


The ceiling above our living room is supported by large beams, but the horsehair plaster is sagging. We had lots of storage in the attic above the room, so we decided to clear a lot out, lift up the boards, and work on fixing the ceiling. The floor in the attic is raised, beneath is all the insulation. We started clearing out insulation and found some old things that had to be from owners long long ago. Tiny white children's shoes, cutlery, pantyhose, and a few sticks wrapped with string. It wasn't the first time we'd found old things.


Previously, when we were putting the pool in the backyard, we found a large ash line in the dirt. In that ash line (which we assume is a burnt down shed) we dug up faucets, spoons, knives, and most surprisingly-- a silver revolver. We kept these items for a couple years on display (I wish I had pictures) but they disappeared about 2006/2007. I've tried to find them but nobody in my house (about 4 other people) have any idea where they went. 


A few weeks after finishing up the attic the dogs start acting strange. We have a beagle and dachshund. The dachshund will start barking while staring up at walls like someone is standing there. Our beagle wakes up at 3am and runs around the house barking like a maniac and nobody can calm him down or keep him quiet. Both of our dogs have starting sitting and barking in this ONE area of the front hallway and won't leave. The beagle, who usually sleeps in one of the bedrooms, now ONLY sleeps in this area. It's like he's standing guard?


One night, a family member of mine is sleeping in his room with the door open (located directly across from this hallway). He told me he woke up because our beagle was sitting there growling and facing his doorway. When he sat up to look at the dog, he heard what sounded like an older woman scream ""Heeeeelp."" I've never seen him so scared! He insists he heard a woman's voice yell this. 


The next day, another member is in the shower (and she's a FIRM non-believer and will explain away anything and everything) when she hears a knock on the bathroom door. She yells out, ""Hello? I'm in here!"" and nobody responds. When she finishes she goes downstairs and asks if anyone knocked on the door. The only other person in the house said he was way in the basement grabbing laundry... She claims it was the dogs, but we all know a dog doesn't *knock* high on the door they scratch at the bottom of the door. She wouldn't yell hello if the dog ""knocked"" on the door.


Two nights ago, I was lying in my bedroom which is located above the dining room. My bed is thick, with a memory foam top, a mattress pad, and a ton of pillows... but no matter what I do I hear what sounds like somebody in the dining room. Walking around, moving stuff, and the distinct noise of a cabinet opening and closing over and over. It's driving me crazy and I'm a little frightened so I crank up the television and go to sleep. 


About 3am that night, my beagle (who I managed to rope into sleeping with me) wakes up and runs to my bedroom door. He starts whining and scratching until I get up and let him out. He runs down the stairs and I hear him growling in the dining room below... needless to say I hurried back to the safety of my bed.


LAST night was the icing on the cake. Me and one other member are the only people in the house. We're watching TV and have it on mute during some commercials. We're talking to each other about how we've been hearing strange noises at all hours of the day and night. As we're talking the dachshund starts barking uncontrollably at the front hallway (per usual). I go over to her and she's looking up, barking away. I tell her to knock it off but she won't stop. I look in the bedroom to the left and the beagle is on the bed, looking out to the hallway, with all his hair on edge. I angrily put them outside as they're barking was overpowering the TV. I got back to the living room.


At another commercial break we muted the TV. This time, as soon as it's muted, we hear a loud BANG in the front hall. Looking at each other to confirm we both heard it, we stay quiet and listen close. Another bang follows... and then the distinct sound of heels on a wood floor as it gets louder like it's nearing us in the living room. We're both really nervous and laughing/crying looking at each other. I get up to walk over to the hallway to see if maybe someone just got home and I walk straight into a wall of ice.


Literally, my right calf is frozen. Goosebumps and a chill spread up my leg, my side, and to my right arm. 


I run over and put my hands on the other person and I'm yelling, ""Holy shit I'm freezing on one side of my body!! Look, there are goosebumps ALL over this side of me. Feel my hands! My left is hot, my right is like ice!"" He stares at me and you can tell he's really freaked out. I'm honestly pretty giddy about it at this point, as it doesn't scare me as much as excites me. Did I just walk into something or someone?

I went with two friends in the middle of the day to an abandoned mental hospital in NJ. Kind of a creepy place, but we went during the day so it's not as bad. There are woods behind it, and there's a little path through the woods that went from the area near the mental hospital to where we had parked. I think a train actually used to run along that path, so it's pretty straight and flat, and it's raised so that there's a little hill running down on each side. 


So after we left the mental hospital, we were walking down this path with me in front and the other too behind me. All of a sudden, a rock falls, seemingly from the sky, almost directly in front of me. I turn around, thinking that one of my friends had thrown it, but they all denied it. So we continued walking along, and about a quarter of a mile later, it happened again, this time with the rock being a little bigger. Again, they claimed that neither had done it and knew that the other hadn't either, and they seemed quite sincere. So we keep walking, but this time in a line so we could all see each other.

I do want to keep some privacy so I'm going to try and obfuscate some details. Here goes...

Last October, shortly before Halloween, I was working at a conference in a major US city. This is a small conference the association I work for holds every year around this time. I get a comped room on the 32nd floor of the hotel. It's a double but I get it all to myself so I don't have to share with a co-worker.

I arrive at the hotel on a Sunday but the incident didn't happen until Wednesday or Thursday night, I can't remember now, but for this story I'll set it on Thursday.

First off, on Monday night I had set the alarm clock next to my bed for 5 am, an already unholy time to be waking up but I didn't want to be late for the daily 6:30 am meetings. I usually sleep past the alarm anyway for about 20-30 minutes so it's more like a ""get ready to wake up soon"" alarm. I set it on Monday night and it beeped annoyingly at 5 on the dot on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday morning.

Thursday night. I get in bed around 10 pm, shut my eyes, and go to sleep...

My eyes dart open as I hear the ominous but familiar beginning of a famous song...the freaking Ghostbusters theme song! First thoughts going through my head: wtf, it's 5 am already and I still feel tired. I turn in my bed to face the alarm clock, it's 12:00 midnight. Next thoughts: stupid alarm clock must've gotten reset somehow, turn it off, be quiet, I want to sleep.

Here's where it gets weird. I reach out, half awake, and start pressing the snooze button. Nothing happens. The Ghostbusters song keeps playing. Frustrated, annoyed, I start moving the mode switch, trying to get it to 'off.' Moving the switch has no effect either! I do remember the song sorta cutting off kinda like when you move the radio dial and the sound fades in and out as you switch frequencies, but if I really had my hand on the frequency dial I should have run into other radio stations, unless every radio station was playing the same song. Finally, I move my hand over to the volume dial and turn it all the way down. It works.

Now it's quiet. As I lay there, pondering what just happened in the previous ten seconds, I now realize it could have been paranormal. I wake up and sit up in bed. I look around the dark room, look outside, look in the reflection on the window for any signs but I don't see or feel anything. Whatever happened, it's over now. I go to the alarm clock which is behaving normally now and set it for 5 am, it did seem like it was reset to 12:00. It takes me a little longer to fall asleep, but I really don't believe in ghosts and I just brush it off as the alarm clock getting reset somehow and some radio station was playing the Ghostbusters theme song at exactly midnight.

Wow this is getting long, thanks if you've read this far. I told my co-workers the next morning and they thought it was weird and creepy, but I'm not sure they believe me. I'm not sure my friends believe me either, but they seem to humor me.

The weird parts are the fact that the Ghostbusters theme song was playing exactly at midnight, exactly from the start of the song, not halfway through (it was close to Halloween so it makes sense to play that particular song but it wasn't Halloween yet). The fact that it was even playing a song at all when I had set it to buzzer. And the fact that pressing the snooze button and moving the mode switch didn't affect it at all. The combination of all those things still weird me out.

Two weeks after my incident I did some google snooping on the hotel, looking for any similar incidents. Instead, I found something else. About two years earlier, a girl had been murdered in her room at the hotel, two floors below where I was staying. She was described as a fun loving girl who enjoyed playing pranks. I wonder if it was her and if she was she playing a prank on me.",,False,,t5_2sntx,True,,,True,t3_tcvco,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tcvco/midnight_radio_me/,

Ok it has been way too long since I've updated my experiences with the Shadow person in my house. Personally I thought it would just subside after a while of just ignoring it, but there hasn't been any change in the frequency of activity I experience around my house.

I'm doing this from memory but I believe the last post I put up dealth with events leading up to the first week or so in Novemeber since then a variety of things have happened. Unfortunately I was talked out of doing any investigations/recordings basically because it wouldn't have gone down well with my girlfriend... lame excuse but you'll see why in a minute. I'm going to try and focus on some things that I consider pretty big and that I really thought about and couldn't find any explanation for, I'll also give a bit of insight into what was going through my head at the time as well.

First Major Event: Holy Water
From what I can remember this activity happened around mid to late November, this activity spread itself out throughout the course of a couple of days but there was some distinct aspects that I couldn't stop thinking about for a while. This was the time I took advice from one of the user posts and put a bottle of holy water in my room, the bottle is still there. From what I can gather using/placing the holy water in my room did not make it happy. I didn't really notice anything at first, but my girlfriend kept complaining about a smell of fart in my room. Unfortunately I was notorious for this so she assumed it was me, I thought it was her just trying to be cute and covering up her own but it wasn't, it was a kind of hot burning smell. This smell was there for an entire day. ONly then did I remember that the smell of sulfur (aka the stuff that goes into stinkbombs) is linked directly to the presence of a demon. This naturally set me off and freaked me out.

.

.

.

I didn't say anything to my girlfriend about the sulfur, this is when I brought the holy water into my room. A lot of interesting stuff happened after I brought the holy water into my room and sprinkled some around the room blessing it, it is still in it's original spot above the entrance way to my door. These 3 events are kind of mushed together but they all happened within the space of 2-4 days so it's hard to give a definite time but I believe this all happened close to the end of November. So this happened in the evening time me and my girlfriend were just back from the off licence, getting some cider to drink later and we went in to my room as normal. What happened freaked us out but not as much as the thing after. Simply put while walking into my room the strings on my guitar managed to strum themselves, I thought I might have brushed off it but it was too clear and distinct, if I brushed off it chances are the guitar would have fallen over instead of playing the notes as cleanly as it did.

.

.

.

.

.

The next day I remember I was driving my girlfriend home that night instead of her sleeping over so I remember we were leaving early enough, around 9 or 10pm. Basically we were cuddled up on my bed I had my hands around her mid as usual and she was leaned in against me, we were watching a movie so we were fairly immoblilised. We finished the movie and she went down to use the bathroom, except when she was washing her hands she saw she had a 2 inch scrape going diagonally across her throat. It wasn't a light scrape it had broken the skin cleanly and it was bleeding, not heavily but enough that you would notice it. Prior to this happening to her I had told her about times that I'd wake up with scratches on my body or how they would sometimes appear randomly on my arms, my scratches were all light and I played it off as dry skin, but they were never as heavy as the scratch I saw on her neck.

.

.

.

.

.

The next night we went to sleep as normal. At the time I had a lot of differennt posters decorating my room that had stood the test of time never losing their grip to my wall. However, the following morning I awoke to the poster closest to the holy water has dangling off the wall and the holy water on the floor. The weird thing was that the blu tac used to hold it up was stretched as if something had pulled, if it fell of naturally there would have been no stretching because the blu tac was so old and hard.

.

.

.

.

.

I have 2 more things to tell you but I'm just going to leave this on a cliffhanger. I'll just say one of them was the most terrifying thing I have experienced to date, the other only happened 2 days ago. And weirdly enough if anyone is interested there has been a lot of ""screaming"" around my area, if anyone has any insight into that it would be much appreciated. Also shoutout to DildoDancer for encouraging me to write more on this!!!

My mother had a friend named Vicki who asked my mom, sister and I to stay with her one weekend.  Vicki lived in a two story house with a circular staircase leading up to the second floor, and a basement finished with all the latest 70's decor, including an ornate wicker chair hanging from the ceiling. 

As I recall, Vicki wasn't the nicest woman... My mother has since confirmed that Vicki seemed to resent my sister and I.  We would play on the circular stairs to the second floor and she would constantly be coming up and telling us to get off them.  My mother said she didn't get what Vicki's problem was as we weren't misbehaving.  She just didn't seem to like kids much.

At some point over the weekend, I found myself in the basement and decided to sit on the wicker chair hanging from the ceiling.  I climbed up on the chair and was just sitting there rocking back and forth.  I don't recall where my sister was at this point... It was just me in the basement as I remember.  Suddenly, the cable holding the wicker chair to the ceiling gave way and the entire thing fell, trapping me inside.  At the same moment this happened, I remember the stereo in the basement came on full blast by itself.

Terrified, I screamed bloody murder for my mom.  My mom and Vicki rushed down to the basement.  My mom freed me from the wicker chair as Vicki shut off the stereo.  As I tried to explain what happened, Vicki started yelling at me for playing with the stereo and breaking the chair.  I remember we went home shortly afterwards.

To this day, I am not entirely sure what happened in that basement.  However with the chair trapping me and the stereo starting by itself, I have a feeling Vicki had a ghost that didn't like me any more than she did.  It was probably a good thing that Vicki never invited us back there again.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_r0e3p,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/r0e3p/my_incident_at_vickis/,

While many of the stories on /nosleep may seem like works of fiction, I assure you this story is 100% true as recounted here.

-----
North of where I grew up is a wooded area with the remains of a house and an old mill in it. While the area has been all but razed to put up subdivisions, when I was in high school it was a pretty rural area without any houses for quite some ways. There were many rumours about these woods (nicknamed Salem's Lot by the kids in town), ranging from being a dumping ground for KKK murder victims to being an ancient forgotten graveyard, and the requisite stories of the unburied dead that wandered among the trees.

It was Halloween in the early 90's and while we had long left high school, we still thought about the old Lot from time to time. Now as we were looking for a place to embrace the winter with one final bonfire of the season, someone suggested the Lot. There were four of us that made the drive up there: Johnny, Marty, Creeping Bob and myself. The plan was to collect up enough wood to last the night while it was still light out, head back to town for food and beer, and finally head back up to the Lot after dark with everyone else. We arrived at around 4:30 or 5:00, pulled over to the side of the road, and made the short hike through the woods to the old mill.

Upon entering the woods, Marty muttered something about being there before and took off into the trees. Being a bit of an oddball, we let him be and continued down the path. As we neared the old mill, Johnny suddenly jumped back in alarm. We looked over at what startled him, and saw a young woman about 18 in a white, old-fashioned type dress that was covered in mud and dirt from head to toe. Her hair was blonde, dirty with soil and was in quite a state. I also noticed she lacked a shoe on one foot and a sock on the other. She looked at us with this wild, crazy stare and ran off back towards the road where we parked the car. Johnny, Creeping Bob and I had all seen her, and started discussing the weirdness of the situation. At this point, Marty rejoined us from the direction the girl headed.

We all asked him if he saw the girl, to which he not only denied, but insisted we were lying about. Being Halloween, he figured we made it up as a story to scare him. Marty could get violent rather quickly, so rather than try to convince him of what we saw, we just dropped it. We continued into the woods and collected up a rather large pile of wood. Satisfied with our efforts, we started back to the car just as the woods were entering twilight. 

As we approached the spot where we first saw the creepy girl, Marty started off. ""Oh, where's that girl?"" he taunted. ""Oh, there she is! I can see her now!""

No sooner had the words escaped his lips when she returned out of the darkness, walking towards us. Marty was now apologizing for not believing us and being a wiseass earlier. We parted as the girl walked between us, and then started following about 10 feet behind us. By now, we were thoroughly creeped out. Marty was trying to ask if she was OK, but she simply followed in silence. As we neared the treeline at the side of the road, I turned back to her.

""Do you need a ride someplace?"" I asked.

""No,"" she replied. ""I am quite fine right here.""

She then turned and started heading back into the woods as we made a hasty retreat to the car. 

As we drove back to town, we all remarked on how weird it was for some girl to be wandering around in a getup like that in a remote woods sans a sock and shoe. It was Ontario after all, and it gets rather cold by Halloween. If it was some kind of elaborate prank, it was a weird and crazy way to set it up. After all, we were the only ones at the Lot, and had we not made plans for a bonfire there, she would have been without anyone to impress with her getup. I suggested that perhaps she was the victim of a sexual assault, given her condition and the crazed mannerisms she displayed during our first encounter. However, had that been the case then why would she risk a second assault by following four guys around the woods? One would think the victim of that type of crime would be wary of strange men immediately afterward. As we all pondered what happened in silence, Johnny finally spoke up.

""I don't think she was a rape victim,"" he said. ""I think she dug herself out of her own grave."" ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_qyx09,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/qyx09/creepy_chick_xpost_from_rnosleep/,

I've never told anyone about it because I'm usually pretty skeptical when it comes to this stuff but after six years I still don't have a reasonable explanation for what happened. 

I was a senior in high school at the time and my best friends parents threw one of their annual superbowl parties. Normally I would have gone but my friend was out of town so I opted to stay home while my mom and dad went to the party. 

At some point during the night I went upstairs to grab a drink or something (I always hang out in the basement at my parents house.) Of course all the lights were off upstairs as nobody was home. After getting my drink I returned to the basement as usual. About maybe an hour later I had to use the bathroom and when I got upstairs I was surprised to find the hall light had been turned on. It was weird but I didn't think much of it, went to the bathroom and shut the hallway light before going back down, shutting the door behind me.

After taking a step down the first stair I heard the distinct click of the light switch flicking back on behind the door. Immediately I froze, my heart pounding, wondering if I really just heard what I thought I did. After a moment I just continued downstairs, too afraid to actually check. I did, however, take the .30-06 from the cabinet and loaded it. I sat for the rest of the night with the rifle in my lap until I heard the garage door open, signaling my parents' return. Putting the gun away I went upstairs and sure enough that god damn hall light was on again and my parents were just coming in through the garage.

I didn't say anything about it then and haven't experienced anything else like that in the house since. Needless to say, I got very little sleep that night.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_qbxff,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/qbxff/whos_screwing_with_the_lights_me/,

When I was eight years old, I lived in an older house. I had a nice little bedroom that was connected to a big playroom where my sister and I would play. We didn't keep it very tidy, but what would you expect? We were just young kids. Despite this all, something seemed off. After I was tucked into bed and my parents had long since gone to sleep, I often found myself lying there awake with a feeling of uneasiness as though someone or something was watching me. After some time, I would eventually run over to my dresser, grab all my stuffed animals and create a wall of them on my bed to make myself feel safer and then I eventually would drift off to sleep. However, sometimes it would be unbearable and I go to my parents room. As expected, they shrugged it off and told me to go to sleep.

Then came one evening when I was in my messy playroom near the door with the step that lead to my bedroom. Although pointless, I was tidying up some of my books into a nice pile when I saw a figure firmly planted in front of me on the step that lead to my room. There in front of me stood the being I will refer to as the ""Tall Man"" for the rest of my life. This man, dressed in a red plaid shirt and worn blue jeans starred down at me. Startled at his sudden appearance, I dropped my books and hid my eyes in fear. Moments later when I worked up the courage to open my eyes, the Tall Man was no longer there.

After my encounter with the Tall Man, I still would feel uneasy at night occasionally but I never did see the Tall Man again. As the years went by I began to attribute these feelings of uneasiness and the encounter with the Tall Man to a running imagination.

Then, when I was around twelve years old, my parents decided to sell the house due to a neighbour issue we had. My father began renovating our dining room to increase the value and appearance of our home. He ripped up the floor, peeled off the old wall paper, and then hacked his way at the walls. As the wall was stripped away, it began to reveal the brick walls of the house and some interesting objects that were left behind. In the wall we found, a newspaper, a card (I believe it was a Jack of some suit), and playing piece that looked like it was from the game ""Sorry"". However, it was the object that I picked up that was the most profound. In the wall, I found an old picture, and the moment that my eyes fell upon the image, my heart stopped.
There in the image stood the Tall Man in his plaid shirt and worn jeans with a women outdoors near a strangely familiar snowball plant. I was in complete disbelief at what I was seeing. I had accepted the thought that the Tall Man was merely a figment of my imagination but now, my hands held something that now lead me to believe otherwise. My father then came over to see what I had found. After he got a good look at it he said to me, ""Wow. That's our old neighbour Doris standing with her long dead husband. Did you know that she and her husband used to live in our house before us? See look! That's the same snowball plant we still have growing in our yard"" And just like that, the Tall Man was no longer fiction, but very real.

My parents took the photo over to give to Doris. She was overjoyed to reunited with it. Unfortunately, a few months later she passed away due to a fall but I have always found solace in the thought that she and her husband must finally be at peace together. Following the return of the photo, I never felt uneasy again at night in the final months that my family lived there.

I still get chills when I think about the day I found the photo. I eventually told my parents over lunch a couple year later about my encounter with the Tall Man and the photo and surprisingly, they believed me. Although I've met a lot of non-believers, till this day I still firmly believe in the existence of spirits and ghosts and my encounter is enough evidence for me.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_punl3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/punl3/me_the_picture_in_the_wall/,

My Aunt moved into a small house right next to the downtown part of our small town, this house has since been bulldozed and a retirement home has been built on top of it. I worked at the retirement home for a while in the kitchen and never experienced anything, even though where the kitchen is located is where the house was. Interestingly enough they are having trouble keeping nurses, not sure why but they work late nights alone, maybe the same issue.

Anyways, my Aunt was in her late thirties when she had her son, my adorable, amazing cousin who is ten now and was born when I was around thirteen. He had a lot of problems at birth and was costantly sick until he was about four, incidentally around when they moved out of that house. My Aunt is a very practical woman and is very skeptic about things like this but my brother and my mom and I all agree there was something wierd about that place, the tv would randomly turn on and off and there was a bad smell that would just appear and then fade away. This house was built in the 1930's and when she moved in there was a whole bunch of random shit in the basement, old pictures and figurines, most of which she kept since she is collector of antiques.
 
I used to go over there all the time on weekends to help her out(she was a single mom and needed all the help she could get). The first time I went there to stay the night I was around 14, he was born a few weeks before my fourteenth birthday so I guess he was still fairly young. I stayed in the guest bedroom, since the little monster still slept in her room (and did until a couple of years ago). My Aunt had a mutt, Shayla, who was as dumb as a bag of hammers but also the sweetest dog in the world, who followed me around constantly. 

Shayla would stick next to me but when I went to go to bed it took some coaxing to get her into the guest room with me, but eventually she did. With the dog curled up at the foot of the bed I fell asleep, with the door cracked open so she could pop out for food or water or so I could get up and help with the baby if I was needed. I woke up around 3 am to the dog whining quietly and what sounded like deep breathing coming from the other bed in the room, I held my breath to see if it was just my own breathing I heard and I was still hearing another person as well as Shayla. All of a sudden the dog started growling(I had never heard her growl before then, unless someone she didn't like got too close to the baby) and I heard the bed creak as if someone was getting up from it. I felt something move close to the bed and the dog gave a loud yelp and ran from the room, obviously I hustled the fuck outta there as well to the living room. As soon as I left the room the lights flickered and the door closed behind me, not slammed but closed gently. I must have passed out on the couch because that's where I woke up with the dog on the floor next to me.

I'm sure most of it can be debunked or whatever, but I have never had any night time issues, maybe a couple bad dreams every once in a while but never night terrors or anything.

We weren't always well-to-do but to be honest, big house or small house it seemed that everywhere we went *something* always went weird.

This house was no different. In the first day I was roaming around I found a small hallway closet next to what would be one of my rooms for a time. Inside were weird pictures - they were so faded and old that when i picked them up they crumbled almost to dust. My mother came along and told me to not play with dirty things, but I think she knew something was up.

One day I remember my mom and teenage step-sister openned my bedroom door and look at me oddly and asked me if i was talking to someone. I said no - I was listening to music on my headphones. Later my mom would tell me that she and my stepsister had heard talking, whispering coming out of the closet. When they got closer it got quiet, as if two people inside had noticed them getting close. 

I was sitting in the livingroom with them both one evening watching some show on comedy central. They were each sitting at different ends of the sofa, my stepsister closest to the hallway entrance. We were all laughing when suddenly they both got quiet. As usual, I heard nothing but my stepsister went pale and looked my mother scared and about to cry. My mom just looked at her and said ""I told you, they don't like you."" 

According to my mother someone had yelled at my stepsister from the hallway and said ""SHUT UP!"" - she moved out a bit after that.

Later on I changed rooms to the one in the middle of the hallway. When inside my room the layout was as follows: to the right my parents room, across from me the bathroom and my brother was to the far left next to the hallway's closet of whispers. I was laying in bed one night and my bed was paralell to the door. One night I noticed something light up in the hallway. The door was closed but the gap between the door and the frame were pretty wide to notice it coming from the left of the hallway, moving its way to the right. Except that the light was green, a bit small, and only showed itself at the top of the gap, closest to the ceiling.

I looked down, expecing a reflection on the floor, but there's nothing. I looked up and the green light is moving more to the right, towards my parents room. 

We didn't have green colored flashlights, so it made no sense. Even if you point a flashlight upwards, some light bounces around. The floor had no hints of green illumination.

I tried to hear footsteps - the floor is tile, and at the dead of night you would at least hear skin walk over it. Nothing.

Then the light disappears from view. Did it go into my parents room?

Some time passes before I see it again, moving from right to left now. 

I look to the floor, nothing. It's up closest to the ceiling... Hovering, green? I was confused and too deathly afraid to open the door and find out what it was. 

Years later I told my brother. He told me he would see similar things from his door - white lights, red ones. 

My mom remembers seeing little black orbs hovering around the floor in the house. She wasn't afraid of them, she told me. One day while in the kitchen she saw three of them and they came close to her. She told them to ""go scare him away"" - they rushed into the bedroom where my stepfather slept and she heard a scream from the bedroom. He left for the day, had to ""get out of the house.""

This experience comes from a sewer line really close to the park where the previous encounters happened. We'd heard an old legend that a few people were killed in an old abandoned incinerator and that the killer had hid the bodies in the sewer system and that there had been ghost sightings recently around the sewer system. So, as brave and stupid 16 year-old boys, we'd decided that if there were gonna be ghosts around, we had to know about it. And kick the ghosts asses if we could. Like I said, fucking stupid. This was maybe a year before my encounter so I didn't know what I was messing with, but I'm still confused why everyone wanted to go,because they DID know. 

Anyways, we left out, with our rain boots on (this was a fuckin' SEWER. It was disgusting) and proceeded to the tunnel. Now, standing outside that tunnel it gets cold immediately, maybe because of the air inside being cooler, but it still seems unnaturally cold. 

After about five minutes of walking we had to use our flashlights. It wasn't long before we came to a set of tunnels within the tunnel. Ryan suggested splitting up, and I instantly thought that was a bad idea. We all had cell phones but no one had reception and it was way too easy to get lost down here. Unfortunately, that didn't convince anyone and we ended up splitting up. Me and Ryan, Corey and Kenny, Josh and Paul. (Once again, fake names. Those are some cheesy ass names.) 

Ten or fifteen minutes after splitting up, me and Ryan heard a loud noise, but couldn't decipher what it was because of the tunnel. If you've ever been in a cave, when there's all that space, sounds get hard to decipher. Same thing going on here. It sounded like it could have been a scream, but it also could have been from someone dropping something. We had no idea and decided that going back wasn't a good idea because we had no idea where they could be or how far down they were, or if anything had even happened. (Just wanna stress that I thought this shit through ahead of time, but no one fucking listened.) Our tunnel came to an opening  that merged with the waterway a bit past the park so we turned around. On our way back we heard a definite yell and running through shallow water. Me and Ryan looked at each other and pretty much decided that we should back out of the tunnel and hike through the woods back to the entrance, rather than run half-blind through a tunnel. 

At that point we saw a bluish blur in the tunnel and heard a growl that sounded like a lion. For the tiniest split-second, I thought I saw a blue Feline-Human hybrid, running towards us. I ran screaming from that thing and basically dove out of the tunnel, running as fast as I could towards where I expected my friends to be. I didn't notice this in that second, but Ryan wasn't with me. I don't know where he was, but he was at the entrance, before me. He said he went a different way through the woods. We heard our friends running and asked them what happened when they'd come out, but they ran right past us. 

""Dude, what the fuck? What are we doing, let's go!"" I said to Ryan. He nodded and started off towards them. We all ran until we were back on the familiar streets of our town. Josh and Paul puked, while me and Ryan tried to figure out what happened from Corey and Kenny and how they ALL had something happen to them. Corey wasn't speaking about it. He just kept saying ""Fuck that, I'm never going back there."" But Kenny spoke up. He said he didn't see anything at all, until Corey had ran. Corey was running away and Kenny looked back and saw the same thing I did, but that it ""screamed"". That was enough to make Kenny run. Josh and Paul said they didn't see anything but heard growling and ran because even if it was just a dog, they thought it could be rabid. Once they ran they said it was like they weren't running. Kind of like in a dream how you feel like you can't run fast enough, or punch hard enough. 

After that, we all agreed that we wouldn't go back to the tunnels and decided to check the abandoned building tomorrow night instead. 

The next night, Josh and Paul said they weren't interested, and Corey and Kenny had gotten grounded for coming home late the night before. Oh, and smelling like a sewer. Their parents thought we were getting high in the sewers. So it was just me and Ryan. (I can't help but notice he's always around. More on that in a bit.) 

As we walked up to the building I thought I saw a shadow near the door move and run away but I didn't mention anything. I know how easy it is to be scared of shadows at night, near the woods. We tried the door, which, amazingly enough, was OPEN. Not locked, or even closed. WIDE OPEN. The first room we encountered was a big open room with a trash compactor in it, and two staircases leading up to the second floor. We took the closest staircase. Now, the thing about that staircase is that there is a chair, nailed to the wall, about six feet up. For no reason. It's the creepiest thing EVER. On the second floor we found everything we expected to find. Two offices, (or what used to be offices, the building is pretty grimy now) a small lounge, and some bathrooms. In one of the offices, were bones and candles. Bones of a rat, and a cat. Whole skeletons. It scared the shit out of me. What was worse were the candles. They were red a black and ALL over. We explored the rest of the building and found nothing. We didn't see or hear anything but as we left it started raining. I remember Ryan didn't say more than one word sentences on the way home. 

I think it's centered around him. He's always there. I've been to these places without him and nothing happens. It kinda strikes me as odd though. If these are native american creatures, why are they attracted to him? He's not native american. I have ancestry in my bloodline, but it's not strong. I need to do some research. The animal skeletons make me think someone bound them there. Then again, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

It was a 30 story concrete constructed building, I lived around the 18th floor, if memory serves.

Often, late at night, I'd hear a huge *whaaaaack* on the ceiling above me, as if someone dropped something made out of heavy wood or metal.  A very sharp whacking sound, right above my head.

Also, I'd hear the sound of chairs scraping across the floor, at all hours of the night.  And not short scraping sounds, but a second or two long.

Finally, and most odd, is the occasional sound like someone dropping a huge bowl full of marbles all over the floor.  This happened every night or so on average (sometimes not every night, sometimes a few times a night).

Sometimes, it would just be the sound of a single marble being dropped, and bouncing on the floor, with increasing tap frequency until it just rattled and stopped.

This happened over a few years, with different tenants above me (and also when the apartment was unoccupied during the summer).

I stumbled across other people experiencing this, particularly in Singapore HDB housing.  (My apartment was in Canada.)

Suffice it to say, I've been interested in these for a while. Tracking anything down is difficult, but recently I thought I had found one that I hadn't heard before. 

It was in German, a language that I don't speak but that I can recognize bits of. A friend of mine, however, is fairly fluent in German though its a second language for her. 

There was a lot of static (which always seems to be the case), and there were two voices. 

The first was more masculine. But it said less. It said, according to my friend, slightly confirmed by me, **""I'm here. In the darkness. I'm here.""** 

Then static. Then a woman's voice, again, in German, reading off numbers. I don't have all of the strings written down. At first it seemed like she was just randomly stringing numbers along. *""Two. Three. Five. Seven. One. One. One. Three. One. Seven. One. Nine. Two. Three. Two. Nine.""* and so forth. It wasn't til I had them written down in front of me (and I'll admit, it took me longer to realize than it should have. One of those things where you look back and go ""oh, of course."") that I realized they were prime numbers.   2      3      5      7     11     13     17     19     23     29 

The string she recited off must have been maybe thirty or forty Primes. It was odd because she recited each number individually with a pause between each. I mean, when I say eleven I don't say ""one ... one"" you know? 

Anyways, after some time of her rattling off numbers, his voice came back. But this time it said **""Make them stop crying.""**

Then she started reciting numbers again, starting over at the beginning. (that's when I figured out they were repeating and not random)

Again, a long string. Seemed like it took forever. Sometimes we lost her voice in static, but I'm sure now that it was a list of Primes.

Then his voice came back, but it said, clearly (in German) **""They murdered them.""** 

Then her repeating the sequence over. Then just static.

It did this twice, each time on a Saturday night around 2 am EST. I'm waiting to see if I can snag it again this Saturday. 

But honestly... the strange counting aside, the man's voice is what gave me the chills.



**Update, 10/3/11** OK, this weekend I kind of had to scramble because we had a wedding reception to go to on Saturday. I didn't get around to trying to listen until around 10:20pm EST. From then til about 11:30 there was nothing. 

So... don't know if the two weeks I heard were a fluke or if it happened before I got the radio on or what. This weekend I'll be closer to Bermuda on a ship than I will be to the US, so I won't get a chance to listen in.

I like /nosleep, but I am more interested in other people's personal experiences versus creepypasta stuff.  I will be posting more stories that are xposts from /nosleep, bare with me, but I'd really like to get this subreddit rolling; I'm interested in what kind of strange shit other people have experinced.

So here is my first story:


So this happened over a decade ago when I was 16. I was spending the night at my best friends house. He lived with his grandparents, so it was easy to sneak out at night.  We had our various ""chill spots"" but one of the cooler places to go in the middle of the night was what we called the jewish center. It was this big gated off piece of land which had all sorts of recreational stuff. It was basically like a huge YMCA, expect more outdoors. We would always hop the fence and chill there because they had a bunch of shit for us to fuck around with. Pool, arts &amp; crafts center, horses, fields, and lakes.

So we decide to go there one night about 1 or 2 am. Been there a million times, never saw anything fucked up like what we were about to see tonight. So we sneak out, hop the fence to the jewish center and were inside. Were walking and talking a bit and we decide to check out this baseball field near the lake. Its a little further out from everything else, so its a little walk. So on our way there we have to pass this really out of place house.

Now we always thought this house was weird because obviously no one could live there its in the middle of nowhere on this jewish center. We always figured it was there because the people who donated the land to the jewish center used to own it or something. Anyway regardless, we have to walk past this old one story creepy brick house to get to the field. It sits a top of a small hill.

Now as were walking past at the bottom of the hill, both mine and my friends attention is drawn to movement ahead of us in the house on the hill. In my eyes, I see something (maybe an animal i think) shifting around in the shadows in the car port of this house. It was dark but both of us saw something cause we both looked at each other... ""did you see that?"" ""yeah what was that?"" ??

So like a pair of idiots my friend and I decide to go investigate. We trek up the small hill and we approach the car port of this house rather quickly. Well we get right there and looking in the car port, looks like its completely empty. We walk in all the way to the back following the walls. Absolutely nothing in there except for a door leading into the house. So we shrug it off and just for the hell of it I decide to open the door kinda just to see if it was open really.

So I open the door and I can see little bits of the floor inside from the moon shining through...I can see that the floor is all caved in and falling into the basement. I look back to my buddy and I remark how it looks pretty dangerous and lets not go inside. So I close the door and it slams shut. Then we hear something right above us ...""boom boom boom"" . It happened so fast but I hear what sounds like something big on the roof running,, picking up speed. Well it happens so fast, but my buddy and I chase the sound to the edge of the car port.

We see this thing jump from off the roof and dart down the hill right in front of us. We only saw this thing for about 2 full seconds before it was down beyond the crest of the hill where we couldnt see the bottom. It looked like a human..it was dark and all black so it looked like a shadow, but it definitely had the shape of a human. Well anyway we are still following this thing and in the split second that we loose sight of it over the hill, its gone. I mean completely vanished.

Now i forgot to mention...at the bottom of this hill is a field for about a hundred yards or so then the tree line. But in that field is nothing, no trees, no big rocks to hide behind. So my friend and I stand at the top of the hill, looking at nothing. I was puzzled how something...man or animal could have moved that quick and disappeared like that. We are standing there, still haven't spoken a word to each other yet.

It didn't really hit me that I needed to get the fuck out of there until my buddy spoke...looking terrified and confused...""did that look like a man to you?"" I couldn't tell what it was, but it was big and humanoid shaped. We said...lets get the fuck out of here.

Now I dont necessarily believe in ghosts or demons or anything, but I also dont count anything out. Its hard for me to belive the spirits of dead people still roam earth, but all I know is that we really dont know shit about this universe and it could be anything.

This starts where the last part left off.

A couple of days later I was, telling my co-worker what I had experienced. We have rotating shifts so, at one point or another, we’ve all had to work the graveyard shift. Two co-workers confirmed what I heard. In their case, one of them had fallen asleep on the front desk and at around 3 am, she woke up frightened because someone/something had woken her up by, apparently, punching the desk. She almost ran away from the hospital. The other co-worker told me that while she was sitting at the same desk doing work, she felt like someone pulled her hair. They both hate that shift.

What was/is happening to us intrigues me so, I’ve done some research of my own and have begun talking to several of the employees that have been working here for a long time. So far, three different people have told me the same story of some strange occurrence that is happening in the ICU, which is on the same floor as the OR. What I’ve been told is that several ICU patients have pointed out seeing and hearing children playing inside their rooms. One patient in particular asked several times why those children where allowed to play there and so late at night. Later that night, he passed away. Nurses and other people around him could not see nor hear these children he spoke off. I’m not sure how or why it happens, but it did; The chilling part of this is that when these patients see the children playing, they don’t live to see another night.

I’ve also been told about a nun that helped patients in the Maternity Ward, back when the Hospital first opened, over 50 years ago. She later hung herself on a tree that’s beside the hospital. She’s been seen by the staff just wandering the hallways many times. Upon hearing that story, I remembered an experience I had a few days earlier to knowing about this nun. I was in the Maternity Ward checking some patient records for surgery the next morning when, out of nowhere, a nun came by to ask me where a specific room was. I told her and she turned around and went on her way. This stands out in my memory because I remember wondering: “What the hell is a nun doing in the hospital at 3:30 am?” The hospital closes to the public at 9pm every night and, they close the main entrance for security reasons. It could be a coincidence but I’m not sure. Another point that I have to consider is that the Maternity Ward front desk is next to the elevators and exit doors. I didn’t hear any elevator door open nor close and no opening or closing of exit doors either. At 3:30am when everything is dead silent, these are noises you will clearly hear. At least nothing else happened that night.

The next couple of nights where routine and quiet; typically boring. One night everything was fine, until the dreaded 3am mark. The atmosphere was suddenly dense, I laid back in my chair and looked at the hallway near the entrance. That’s when I saw her. I could barely make out her appearance; it seemed like smoke or mist coming together and forming the faint figure of a woman. I couldn’t believe it; I was frozen to that goddamn chair just looking at her. I say it’s a “her” because it looked like a woman, I believe she was hovering because I couldn’t see any feet and she was around 50 feet away from me. This lasted somewhere around 30 seconds but it felt like a lifetime to me. After sometime, I got the courage to get up and try to walk towards her. Immediately as I was headed down her way, she disappeared into a fine mist. I was so fucking scared that night; not wanting to be alone in the OR anymore, I went downstairs to the ER to check if they needed help.

Anything just to not stay up there alone another night.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_jr1ta,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/jr1ta/my_first_job_working_at_a_hospital_pt_2_xpost/,
1313144195.0,19,self.Thetruthishere,jgn76,Experience that made me doubt my sanity,jamieeeeeee,23,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/jgn76/experience_that_made_me_doubt_my_sanity/,"This is a copy-paste repost, since I originally posted this moments ago in /r/sharestory ""why i believe in ghosts"" thread, but after finding this place I figured visitors here would find it more relevant to their interests.

Personaly, I'm not sure what to believe, but I will tell you what I have experienced. It was few years ago ( 4 maybe, was 19 at the time ).

We were staying at our friends parents place, it might sound cliché or a bad movie, but there was graveyard/church literally nextdoor. it was large property with 1 house and 1 guest house - newly reconstructed, it used to be part of the church where the nuns used to stay. I should note I for one am not religous at all and I am sceptical and very logical person.

I don't think I have ever told this to anyone, since part of me thinks that I am a nutjob and others would do the same I guess.

But to get on with the actual story!

Fast forward, I went to sleep in upstairs livingroom, everyone else was either sleeping already or called it a night with me. It was large room with the bed in the corner and another seperate bed next to it, so I was looking at the entrance to the room and close to my feet were doors to the next room where my bro was sleeping.

I was staring through the empty room and then I saw, what looked like a girl just standing there. First I though I see a chair with a shirt over it or something and my mind is playing tricks on me ( there was a table with few chairs that direction ). Then I quickly dismissed that as it got weird.

She started moving towards me, not really walking - imaging almost standing image just appearing closer and closer to you, but you feel it kinda moves, maybe like a game with 5FPS, that is the closest analogy I can come up with.

It occured to me it might be this girl that was staying with us so I called her out, well it wasn't and this ""person"" didn't appear hear me. She just walked beside me, sat on the seperate bed and started to kinda..roll around it, goofing around, laughing/smiling. I should note there was absolutly no sound through this story. She had brown hair.

Anyway, I know... what, the, fuck... I was dumbstruck. I called out again ( not very loud, I was freaked out a bit ) "" Is someone there? "" I also reached out trying to touch her, but I couldn't feel or have a grip on anything like she wasn't there.

Then I notice another one, came from the same direction of entrance to the room. Rather large man bearing down on me in similar fashion as was the girl. But this time I wasn't feeling curiosity with only slight fear of the unknown as with the girl. Now I started to freak out, feeling fear and intimidation.

I was too paralyzed ( due to the freak out ) to do anything besides turning myself over facing the wall. I saw another girl - blonde, lying next to me. Moment of peace and curiosity overcame me again. She was next to me, but it appeared as if the wall was clear glass and she was behind it, less then meter away. I realized this because I tried to touch her as well and my fingers just bumped against the wall.

In back of my mind I pondered if I went insane or I had a brain tumour/poisoning from water or whatever and started to hallucinate.

I was still facing the blond girl and I don't know why, but I waved at her. Much to my surprise, she smiled and waved back. At this point I lost it, buried my face into the pillow, my brain just said to me ""that's it, fuck this I'm out of here"" and shut down. I didn't think, I didn't concentrate, I'm not sure I was even breathing. I just felt presence literally towering all around me and only thought I had was 'I want this to end.'

It lasted few hours I guess then the sun slowly started to come up and soon after that it was all gone.

I thought it all ended with that, but it didn't. Will tell more if you are interested! :)

Thank you for reading through all the way here and sorry for any errors.

The building was only about 7 years old and was built really well. It was a one bedroom but had nearly 3500 square feet *including the finished basement with no carpet*. 

This was before we got pregnant and we still had a VERY nice king size oak framed bed. It had a canopy with 6 large mirrors (insert sex jokes here, and yes we did it all :D) Anyway, my wife was the first to notice strange things happening in the home, which is VERY odd as I'm quite attuned to the ""supernatural"". She kept telling me about a man sized figure that she kept seeing for a split second before it would go into the basement really fast. 

The first time she saw it, it scared her so bad she called me home from work because she thought someone was really in the basement ""I worked a few blocks from the house so I would be faster then the pathetic police :D"". There is no point of entry or exit from the basement, not even windows so there was no person there. 

One day as we were trying to get to sleep (we worked nights, and slept days, so it was about 10am or so). Were laying together in our nice bed and I was laying closer to the wall. I had my arm over her while trying to fall asleep (I believe it's referred to as spooning). I was just about to doze off when, for some reason I felt I had to open my eyes. 

Just as I did I saw a man leaning over our bed (which, the mattress was about 2.5 feet off the floor due to the frame) and he appeared to be looking quite intently at my wife's knee. 

Now, at this point I need to tell you that I have a thing about me. If I get shocked awake, I'm 100% right now ready to fight. I've nearly hit my wife because she shocked me awake, but I recognized her at the last moment and didn't swing or anything. I don't know why I do this, I believe it has something to do with my rather fkd up childhood :D (and who doesn't have one of those). 

At any rate, when I opened my eyes, I see this man *in full detail* looking at her knee, it was only a split second before I reacted. I lifted my head and right leg at the same time, as I did this he looked at me nearly as shocked as I was. He was wide eyed and looked genuinely scared. Just as my foot was about to connect with his head in a full force kick, he vanished. 

My wife opened her eyes just as I lifted my head and she caught the tail end of the vanishing. She didn't know what it was, but immediately complained about her leg *the one the ghost was looking at* feeling very tingly, before I said anything to her about what he was doing. 

She understood immediately what had happened and calmed me down. When I wake up like that my body is instantly infused with adrenaline. My heart pounds very very hard and I feel like I could lift a friggin car. So, she calmed me down, explained that she was fine and there was nothing to worry about. 

At that point I was pissed so I said into the room *mainly because I was sure he was still there and could hear us* ""I don't care that you are here, I don't care what you want. Leave us the hell alone or I will deal with you accordingly"". Now, normally a threat like that would probably be answered with hostility, but I had demonstrated a few times before this that I had the knowledge to do as I said.

From that point on, we never saw the entity again. I feel kinda bad as I don't think it meant any harm, but we were newlyweds so I felt the need to protect my wife.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_j7vdk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/j7vdk/an_interesting_encounter/,

Summer of 95, we moved into the house my dad still lives in. I was 7, and we were originally from Baltimore. My grandfather moved in about a year later and my dad sold the house in Baltimore. During the first few years I dont recall anything that couldnt be contributed to the house making odd noises as it settles or when its windy, as it was a bit older and also in the middle of nowhere. When I was in 9th grade, we got an extension added to the house as part of some updating and renovations. The master bedroom was going to be part of the extension, with an office and walk in closet. Well until my dad got furniture and whatnot, he stayed in his old room. One night before bed, I went to the new side to make sure all the lights were off and everything. I step out of the office, turn, and in the closet I see my oldest brother standing there looking at me. He died in a carcrash in 1990. There was nothing malicious or bad about it, but I hauled ass and said something to my dad who kinda brushed me off. I tried to rationalize it but when I went back to see if it could be explained by clothes hanging up or something, but there were no clothes on the side of the closet where I saw him. 
About 6 months after that, my grandfather (who was in an old folks home because due to his declining health he needed round the clock nurses) passed away in his sleep, right before thanksgiving 2002. All of the immediate family members woke up at the same time, looked at the clock and went back to sleep, me included. It was sometime around 2-3am, i dont remember now. A few months after this, my dad's gf's son, who i call my little brother, and I were doing the dishes. We both heard my grandfather call my name from the basement, which is where his room was and where he spent all his time. It was loud and clear, obviously my name, in his voice. We looked at each other and told my dad, he told us something that my grandmother tokd him when he was younger about hearing a ghost call ur name but i dont remember it anymore... Either way, every know and then while downstairs, my little brother or i would sometimes feel a breeze or watch a door close, even though there was no source of air/wind at all. Thats all i can think of right now, but I know theres a few more. Sorry for the run on sentences and whatnot too, my writing skills have gone to shit.

A little initial information: my basement is divided into a social area and bedroom to the left of the stairs, and a storage area (where we keep food)/unfinished workbench area to the right.
I've come to believe the basement to be haunted by an animal, most likely what was once a dog.
I'm 24 now, but back in high school I dated a girl who, at one point was over at my house and got some snacks from the storage area. She had gone downstairs, and within a few seconds came running back up stairs. Asking what the hell was her problem, she told me ""There's something big down there"". 
At this time, I had 2 dogs, one large/medium sized, and one pretty small, only about 2 feet high; they don't hang out in the basement. Especially in the storage area. 
So I went down to investigate, expecting maybe a mouse at best which aren't altogether uncommon around my neighborhood. I've seen raccoons around, but never in the house. Investigating, i found nothing, and asked her what she saw. She told me she saw a big grey animal pass by her a few feet away through the corner of her eye; interesting, I thought.

Maybe a year passes; still in high school I have a friend over who goes down to grab some ritz bitz sandwiches, and I only remember this because of this situation. He goes down, within seconds comes running back up the stairs telling me ""Man, there's a hell of a big dog down there"". 
At this point, only my smaller dog is alive, and accounted for to not be in the basement. I tell him ex girlfriend had said the same thing a long while ago. I asked him what it looked like/what he had seen, telling me he saw a large grey animal on all fours walk past near the back of the storage area as he turned the corner. Of course I saw nothing when going down to look.
A few years pass and I'm looking over my parents house one weekend I'm down from college. My only dog has been put in a kennel because they were gone for over a week, so I'm alone in the house. The basement is significantly cooler than the upstairs bedrooms, so I decide to sleep down there for the night. At some point, I'm woken up by the very distinct sound of footpads on carpet (If you have carpet like an office building or a school, and you have a heavy dog walk across it you'll know the sound). Very interesting, I think to myself. 
So I grabbed a flashlight, took a look around; behind couches, in the back room (which is not carpeted), all throughout the bedroom and social area and see nothing. I laid back in bed but kept hearing the sound. Eventually I just shouted ""I'm trying to sleep!"" to no avail, all I hear is pacing. I wasn't too nervous or uncomfortable because if the ghost/spirit/animal wanted to have done anything, it would have. So I figure to leave it to pace, and I headed upstairs to my bedroom to sleep. 

Since then (maybe 4 years ago) I haven't spent much extended time around my parents house/basement, and neither does anyone else. But my parent's newer dog prefers to hang out in the basement. 

This may not interest many others, but why not share. 
I've told the experience to friends and it makes them nervous enough not to be down there if we happen to be at my folk's.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_iym11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/iym11/just_discovered_this_sub_and_felt_id_share_my/,

You came out of the room,awesome!"" I figured my husband left the door open for him.So I'm looking at the cat and I see he has a white tipped tail.I didn't think anything of it,the cat is black and white but I didn't remember what colors were where.So I hop out of bed and see the room where we kept the cat was still closed.I think to myself ""man I would flip out of the cat was still in here"".I opened the door and I shit you not,the cat was sitting on the bed in the guest room.Not only is he sitting there but his tail is solid black.not white tipped.I grabbed the phone and called my mom,lol I didn't know what else to do! 

So I tell my husband and he believes me but we try to forget about it.Maybe I was half asleep or something,you know how you always try to rationalize it.lol.

Well a few weeks later we have our friends stay over while they are house hunting.We never mentioned anything because we didn't want to scare them.My friend is allergic to cats so she asks if its okay that she keeps their door closed so the cat doesn't come in their bed.I say sure and we all go to sleep.The next morning she says "" I guess the cat got in our room? Did you let him in?"" I said no,no one even opened her door.And she said ""oh,well hes in here.he can stay in here now,hes sleeping on the bed.I'm just going to get dressed."" I said ""he is in there now?"" And she says yeah but it's fine since they are headed out for the day (giving her allergy meds time to work) I was looking right at our cat,he was sleeping on the bench of the kitchen table.we were all like ""noooooo...."" Lol

Later she was telling us that the cat was being crazy and grabbing her feet from under the bed at night. He does do that but he was in our room all night with the door closed.We ended up telling her the whole story and man she turned WHITE!!! Lol.

And finally the last memorable story was just a month ago.My husband and I were packing our suitcases for vacation and he says ""why does he keep running back and forth like that?"" And I said ""I don't know,go check.But your gonna shit if he's sleeping in here somewhere"". Bigger then shit he takes two steps towards the door and sees the cat fast asleep in the middle of the room.We just looked at each other and whispered ""Noooo...."" Like we always do when we are to freaked out to do anything,hahaha.

So those are my stories.We both believe in the paranormal so we just joke about ghost cat.We don't know where he came from but our cat came from a shelter where he was mistreated by a previous owner so I always assumed that ghost cat was a litter mate since they both look just alike,just with different areas of black and white.Other then us seeing him randomly or grabbing our feet from under the bed,we don't have a problem with him being here.And by grabbing our feet,I mean batting at them like normal cats do,not in a creepy monster under your bed type way.lol",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1k6qn5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1k6qn5/ghost_cat/,
1375122488.0,18,self.Thetruthishere,1jaj2j,[Me] A few weird things happened to me as a child,Blondeseaglass,22,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1jaj2j/me_a_few_weird_things_happened_to_me_as_a_child/,"So, I'll just start by saying for background information that when I was five, I moved from Oregon to Southern California. My family has always lived in relatively new houses as in no houses older than twenty years. I'll admit that I can be a little dramatic but I promise you everything I'm telling you really happened and nothing is over produced for excitement or anything. Also, I'm an extremely creative person and my parents have blamed most of my experiences on that. But everything that has happened to me I can't explain and is most absolutely true.

Anyways, for the first story, I was younger than five and was still living in my home in Oregon. It was a beautiful home and wasn't quite too old as I can remember. I can't remember the street name but I can ask my parents later for it and I'll post later or something the year it was made. Any who, my mom has told me multiple times that when I was younger I would constantly talk to an imaginary friend. But to me, he wasn't imaginary. I could actually see him. I can barely remember what he looks like but he had kind looking, dark eyes, white fluffy hair that was slicked back, black pants, and wore nice white shirt. I couldn't see his feet ever because they faded and became invisible. Most of the time, I remember talking to him and he would talk back. He was comforting and polite, and would only appear if I called for him. Of course, because he was like a ghost, I called him Ghost Friend. He would only appear in the house and very rarely outside of the house in the forest behind our backyard. I never felt threatened by him. So story time! This is how I know he wasn't just imagined. When I was little, I got sick a lot. One night, I was dead asleep until I violently was woken up by vomiting. At this time, I shared a room with my older sister but she was dead asleep. So I was trying to get to my parents room because I was throwing up everywhere. But being the three or four year old I was, I couldn't open the door. Just after a few times trying to open the door, Ghost Friend came out of nowhere and opened the door for me. So then I ran to my parent's room and went to the doctor the next day.


Anyways, once I moved away from Oregon, he never visited me anymore and I was stuck to pretending he was there. I never physically saw him again, but only in my imagination. 


Another time, when I was older, probably preteens, I lived in a house that was built in 1986 or 1987 if I remember correctly. One night, I was getting ready to fall asleep. So to help you visualize the room, my bed faced my closet and to the right of the bed there was a window and an empty space, on the right there was my bedside table and a lamp. I was just about to doze off when I heard a growl come from my window and something claw at my chest. This feeling didn't go away until I turned on my light. Yes, I know that was sleep paralysis but as I turned on my lights, I looked directly in front of me at the closet and the curtains that covered my closet (I had just renovated my room and gotten new furniture, and we removed the old closet doors and put in curtains) moved as if somebody had just pushed through them. That part isn't sleep paralysis. Suddenly, as I'm watching the curtains move, I reach for my Bible that was under the side table (yes I grew up in a very religious household) and held it up. As I did this, the curtains moved violently to the sides of the closet, faster than I could probably ever push them and then they laid perfectly still. For the rest of the night, I didn't sleep but didn't dare get out of my bed either. But that was the most violent stuff like that would happen, luckily. But also, I thought this house was possibly haunted for another reason. So in this same house, you could always hear if someone was walking around upstairs if you were downstairs and you could sometimes hear if one of my family members walked across their room or something. You could always tell where a person was by the noises the footsteps made. But even when I was home alone, I could hear walking noises coming from upstairs from my parents room. It would come from the closet to the bedroom window. And sometimes, it would start halfway, or stop halfway. I just got used to it as a child, and was not very bothered with it until later. I would even hear the walking when I was in my room. So one day, when I was home alone, all the windows were closed, the AC and heat were off. It was perfectly quiet when I heard the footsteps. I was curious because my parents always brushed it off as being the wind. But how could it be if every window was closed and everything was off? And houses don't make creaking sounds that fluid. So I ran to my parents room, swung open the door, ran to the closet and started to walk across to the window, mimicking the footsteps I had been hearing. Once I got there, I turned around and being the stupid kid I was, I went, ""WELL?!"" In an intimidating tone. When suddenly, the footsteps came running towards me. In that instant, I got freezing cold so I noped the fuck right out of there by jumping over my parent's bed and sprinting out of the room. I suppose I learned a valuable lesson there about not taunting spirits. 


So sorry about the wall of text. I have a few other stories too but I don't want this post to be too long! Do you guys think that the things that happened to me can have logical explanations?

This is the first time I have put my experience into written word but I will try to convey the experience and emotion as accuratley as possible.
  To preface myself, this is not the one and only occasion in which I have encountered something beyond the strange, unusual and explainable. I am and have always been an avid outdoors person who enjoys the woods, mountains and general solitude of the wilderness. I would not claim myself to be afraid of the dark woods or night time in the mountains, nor am I superstitious in my everyday life however my personal encounters force me to consider a wide and unorthodox realm of what is possible.

  This experience took place on Christmas Eve 2005, I was on break from Univ of Az my freshman year. Usually my parents, two sisters and myself either host extended family or travel and be guests of family for Christmas,  that Christmas we decided to spend a small holiday at home just the 5 of us. Having gotten used to being a very active college student I became restless hanging around the house all day and night. I decided to take a night time hike at a nearby lake. I pack a bag, food for 2 days, a backpack stove and extra winter clothes. The snow at my house was about six inches so I expected at least 2 foot along the trail and I tend to over pack because shit happens when you are least prepared. It was roughly 10pm when I left the house and it took me approx. 90 mins to reach the lake. The lake and forest around it is roughly 8 or 10 miles east of the Navajo Nation as the crow flies. The trail I intended to hike was only 3.5 miles and led to a fire tower. I had hiked this trail a few dozen time since I was 7 or 8, and had become very familiar with a very large portion of the surrounding area. Because of this I expected an easy and uneventful hike to tire me out and ease my restlessness. 

  I pulled into the staging area for the trail head, got out of my truck and vathered my pack along with final checks for emergency essentials. I reached the trail head and as expected the trail was untouched and covered in roughly 18inches or snow.The snow was not real soft but not real firm and icy either. The crust of the snow broke easily under my boot steps but did so with a very loud crunch that seem to sharply crack the cold crisp silence of the night.  Believe me, it was a very quiet night. Soon I fell into a nice comfortable but quick pace, an instinct hiking pace I have developed. The trail began in a very lightly wooded flat and slowly meandered into a moderately wooded dell that continued for a half mile or so. At this time I knew the switch backs would begin to carrying me up the hill side. I would estimate I was 75 or 80 yards from the first switch back when I noticed I had substantially slowed my pace and caught myself instinctively scanning with area infront of me. This is a posture I usually assume when I am hunting or stalking big game through the forest. After I caught my self the first time I thought nothing of it. The second time I had caught myself doing the same thing was only a hand full of moments later as I was near the second switchback. This time I payed more attention to my gut and kneeled down next to a stump. Up until this time I was using only by petzl headlamp that when on high, as it had been, throws off enough light to carry a beam roughly 50 or 60 yards. As I kneel next to the stump I flip up my head lamps red filter lens and turn the power setting to low then proceed to listen carefully while scannning nearly 360 degrees around me. After 5 minutes or so my eyes adjust better to the darkness and I caught a faint glow of red postioned roughly at the switch back infront me. I decided to sit for a few mintues and continue to observe and listen while my eyes continued to adjust. The faint red glow never really seemed disappear but the intensity seemed to diminish at irregular intervals over those few minutes. I grew impatient and summized there was a trail or survey reflector at the switch back that was catching my red filtered light. By the time I decide to stand up and proceed with my hike  I would guess 10 mins had past.

  As I stood upright I pulled out my medium handheld mag light and flip my headlamp back to high and switch it from red filter to the white LED. It was at this point when my state went from relaxed and calm to a sudden jump in that fight or flight feeling that only an adrenaline dump can produce. My two lights had easly lit up the switch back where I was observing the faint red light however I did not see the reflector I had told myself was the origin of the red glow. As I began the process of controlling by breathing and the feel of panic and slowly step forward with uneasy suspicion I notice a red glow appearing several feet up the hill in front of just beyond the switchback and just beyond the beams of my two lights. Upon controlling my panic I began to try and determine what this glow could be. The best, new, answer I came up with was the reflection was from the eyes of some animal. This made sense to me except I had never seen an animal with red reflective yes, and never with such a hazy glow. The tales of mountain lions that ran these mountains and reports of a small pack of mexican red wolves in this part of the state made the choice for me to turn around and head back down the trail. I slowly turned around and slowly walked the path I had just come no more than 15 mins before. I thought it was a wise idea to keep my mag light shining behind me with hopes that if this was a predator animal it might think I was still facing it as I retreated.  I had turned the corner and began the slow walk to the base of the switchbacks. Again I got within 30 or 40 yards of the last turn that led to the dell when I saw the glow only this time I made out a distinct set of two red glows with just enough space between the two to make them distinct and seperate from each other. This is when I confirmed it was an animal which put me at easy but also worried me because it did not follow me but actually cut me off on the trail as if it knowingly intercepted me in my retreat. 

  I stood there wieghing my options and risks. I could continue moving forward down the trail and hope the bold move would keep a buffer of at least 20 yards between the animal and myself, this option made me the most uneasy so I opted for my second best way out. I could cut staight down the hill side through the somewhat thick woods risking a twisted ankle or a bad spill with all the forest litter, stumps and windfall trees masked by the deep snow, it seemed like the way to go. I proceed ed carefully but quickly through the wood and snow on the ground when I reach the bottom and connect up with the trail.  At this point I knew I was a good mile from my truck and it was a flat easy mile, half was through the dell and the last half over the meadow. After only a few quick yards back to the truck my gut told me to stop and turn around. I did just that, I cut of trail a few stew and kneeled next to a smallish pine tree. This time I completely turned of my lamps and listened with an intense concentration. My instinct told me the crust on the snow should break under the foot of anything larger than a rabbit or raccoon. My eyes had only began to adjust to the darkness when I saw the two red glows emerging from where I imagined the last switchback was and clearly but slowly moving away from the hill side. I tried to slow my breathing so I could better hear the foot steps of the animal that seem to be curiously pursuing me. I would guess it had moved a fair amount of distant closer to me and I guess a hundred yards from my position.  It did not seem to move with focused intent on me but did seem to move with purpose. It was hard to judge distants accuratley with such low light so I told myself to stay silent and watch for 15 more seconds. Out of no where my brain seemed to have finally catch on to the fact that I had not heard a single sound since I had stopped, no snow crunching underfoot not even a twig snapping no sound that might suggest any animal moving through the winter night. Along with no sounds I realized the red glow was not the reflection of eyes, there was no light to be reflected from an animals eyes. So I finished my 15 seconds stood up turned and took the few stepz to the trail where I turned my mag light and head lamp full on and proceeded with a quick pass. 

  This is where panic really started and stayed with me. Every 20 or 30 yards I would stop turn around and listen. After the second stop it became clear the two red glows where following me but staying just out of reach of my light beams. As much as I tried to control myself panic continually pushed harder and harder to take control so I began to pick the pace up. What ever it was followed and remained outside of my lights. After several minutes of escalating panic and on the verge of a dead run I could see my head lights lightly reflecting the white LED lighy of my head lamp and I knew I was within 100 yards or safety and escape. But, as before something screamed at me to stop, kill my lights kneel and listen. I did just that but being in a meadow I could not stoop next to stump or tree to help break my silhouette,  so I kneeled down and concentrated.  This time the red glows continued to move slowly closer, I expected they stayed out of my beam which is roughly 60 yards from me so that where I figured they would stay even with my lamps off. No such luck, the pair of close set red glows came just close enough to me that my eyes could not make out a figure, shadow, silhouette or make any distinctions between what they were and the night and the forest. The speed with which the two had closed the 60 yards or so was astoundingly quick and with not a sound to go with it or any other movement you might accosiate with something running at you. I could do nothing but watch in awe as they stopped an begin to grow in intesity. As the intensity grew they elevated themselves from roughly 2 feet off the snow to what I would guess 10 or twelve feet off the snow. Af this point the brightness of each seem to peak at approx. the brightness of a desk lamp. The light shown of the snow, the tree boughs to either side but it  did not seem to shine on objects behind it. After reaching this peak hieght and brightness the two very slowly separated maintaining everything about them except they distance from each other. They finally stopped 6 feet from each other and just as they stopped an third red glow came quickly up behind them and stopped right inline with the original two. I cant say if this third one literally appeared out of no where some where by the base of the hill or if it had came the same route I just traveled but I had noticed it becUse I was so focused on the two right in front of me. How ever it came about I instantly decided the best idea was to get up and book it back to my truck. So I did just that. I ran as fast has I felt I ever had pack and all with no light. I crashed reckless through the snow with a panic driven focus only to get to my truck. When I finally reached my truck I jumped in turned the key and immediately switched on my high beams. The three were still able to stay just out of the beams of my head lights. I backed out and left down the snow packed forest road. My trucks 4 wheel drive was already engaged from the drive in so I drove as quick as I could. After the first mile or so I figured I had left the red glows behind but continued to obsessively check my mirrors.  Then I checked and saw the faint hazy glow of two and when I put my attention back o. the road I saw the third just beyond my high beams. I tried to maintain control of fear so I could maintain control over my truck. They three stayed in their intial positions the 20 minutes it takes to get down the mountain but upon reach the small community at the bottom the simply vanished. They didnt fade away or slowly peel away from me, they were there and then gone.

  At this time I was so relieved I was off the mountain,  out of the forest, no longer being followed and regained cell service I began to shake and pretty much lose all composure. A feeling of absolutely no control over my self or emotions came over me and all I could do was continue to drive. I called my parents to let them know I was heading home and made it off the mountain ok. My mom apparently heard the strain and stress in my voice and pushed at the matter. I struggled through the short and rattled version of what just happened. By this time it was pushing 130 am and she instructed me to come straight home and I had no other thoughts but to do just that. Before she hung up she told me to call a family friend who lived in the area and knew it very well and is a navajo like my family and I are. So I call him, wake him up but this time around I am able to deliver a more detailed, more concise and less emotiinal account of what happened to me in the previous hour or more. My experience was like nothing he had every heard of before.  By the time our conversation was finished I was still 15 or 20 minutes from home still with adrenaline in my system and no answers. I sat there and thought about it over and over again, when I got home I tried but never slept the night. Christmas day was a a dull passing of hours. I thought only of what had clearly chased me and all the odd and wild aspects of the glowing things that I did truly without a doubt saw. I did not sleep for another 2 nights after that christmas eve. 

  After that night I sought a few people who knew the area very well and asked if they saw or heard about anything odd up there. Some said no and others came up with what seemed to me as the generic ghost stories that happened to the cousin of a friend's friend. I passed these of as nonsense and camptales. So, to this day I have no answers or hints as to what happened that night. Over the years I have been able to put it back together as closely as I can remember and some of the things I know I saw and felt are things I can not shake. I have never felt such fear and lack of control over everything as I did that moment when I realized the three red glows were gone. I maintained so much more control over myself during the actual event than I did when I thought it was over.
  I have not returned to that area since thaf night, not strictly out of fear and apprehension but I also never had a reason to go up there since.

  If anybody has any theories or guess even suggestions as to what it is, was, might have been or caused it all please feel free to speak up.

Pt 2,Blacklightzero,27,10,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1h7pk6/mefam_its_all_a_lie_pt_2/,"My grandmother was widely known as a shrew but she was a saint to me. After my grandfather died she lived on another 6 years.  I got older and had less time for her between work and school and sometimes I onky managed to see her every two weeks even though she lived only a few blocks away. My family fell on hard financial times but even on her fixed income she always made sure I was in want for nothing.

I was 17 when she got sick.  She had an aneurysm in her aorta that surgeons successfully clipped, but they missed the one in her brain.  As she was recovering from the surgery, the brain aneurysm burst and put her into a coma. 

 She stayed in a coma for a week before she died.  I got off work early and stopped by the hospital before going home. I told her that I loved her and that I realized how much she had done for me and that I wished we had more time.  On my way out of the ward a code blue was announced.  I saw people rushing down the hall as the elevator doors closed.  By the time I got home they had already called and told us she was gone.

We knew she had mixed feelings about her own death. She wanted to be with her husband but she wanted more to be there for me.  

I never lucid dream.  My dreams are strange, etherial and generally very abstract.  About two weeks after she died I had a vivid dream.  I didn't know it was a dream at the time, but maybe it wasn't.   
My mother and I were sitting at the kitchen counter having a conversation when the kitchen phone rang.  My mom picked it up but she only heard a dial tone.  When she hung it up it began to ring again.  I picked it up this time.

""Hello?""
""Hi J, this is grandma.""

I was aware she was dead.
""Grandma! How are you...""

""I wanted to talk to you before I left. I'm much happier where I am right now. I'm just fine.""

""Where are you?""

""I'm here.  I haven't left.""

""Is grandpa there?""

""No, he's on the other side already.  I have to go find him. I'm so prout of what you are.""

My mom was begging to talk to her.
""Grandma, mom is here.  She wants to talk to you.""

""No, don't give me to her. I don't want to talk to her!""

""C'mon, she just wans to say goodbye..""

""No! I don't....""

I handed the reciever to my mom.  She put it up to her ear and said ""Mom, I love you.""
A bellowing scream issued from the reciever so loud it hurt my eardrums even though it was up to my mom's ear. (ThinkAphex Twin - Come To Daddy but angrier and screechier)

""Mom? Why?!""

The scream continued.

""Why won't you talk to me!!!""

She dropped the phone, crying, and went to her bedroom upstairs.
I picked up the phone again.  The scream had stopped.

""I told you not to give me to her. I don't want to talk to that bitch.""

""Why not, she's crying now.  She loves you!"" 

""It's your fault.  You should have done what I told you.  I need to talk to you, not her.""

""Why?""

""I need to tell you some things.  You can't tell your mom.  I can't tell her either.""

""What things?""

I wish I could remember what she said here.  I feel like it was very important and there were seven or eight things she told me.  I have long considered hypnosis to revive the memory but I am afraid to.

When she was finished she said ""I want you to remember how proud of you I am.""

""Thank you.  What is 'the other side'?  Heaven?""

""Do you remember what your grandfather told you?  That it's all a lie?""

""How are you calling me?""

""I have to go.  Its been too long.  Never forget I love you.  Bye bye.""

""Wait! Grandma!""

Click.  The phone call ended.

I woke up in my bed, thirsty and with a headache. It was morning but I didn't remember the night before. As I walked past my parent's room I heard sobbing.  I looked in to find my mother sitting on her bed.  She saw me in the doorway.  ""Why wouldn't she talk to me? Why?  I just wanted to say I loved her....""

I walked to the bed and put my arms around her and let her cry on me.  Later we talked about our experience.  We remembered the exact same thing happening.  Both of us had headaches and woke up unusually thirsty.  Apparently there had been some abuse by my grandmother against my mom when she was younger.  The fact that grandma wouldn't talk to her is still a sore spot for my mom all these years later.

A little over a year and a half ago, my husband and I moved to a different state for his job. Got a new apartment in a place with a much higher cost of living than we were used to, which caused a load of financial stress. I was starting to get depressed as I tried desperately to find a new job.

One night, I wake up and look over the side of my bed toward the nightstand. There's nothing there, but I get that feeling of being watched. It's so intense... just painful. For no reason at all, I know there's something beside my bed, and I just know it's a little boy. Brown hair. Pale. Dark T-shirt. And he's just staring at me in my mind's eye. Without any reason, I know without a doubt that he's standing there, staring at me. And I start bawling because I'm so confused. 

If there had been something there... if I had seen something... I could have at least be terrified. But at that point, I thought I was going crazy. I wondered if the stress from money and job hunting had gotten to me. 

Thankfully, my husband is an angel. He listened, and he didn't judge. He suggested some ways to relax about job hunting and try to just have faith I would find something. I did eventually get a job, and I don't remember ""seeing"" the little boy again until long after I was employed. 

A few more times throughout the year we lived in the apartment, I would wake up from sleep or near-sleep with that sting of awareness that I was being watched. It wasn't every night. It wasn't even triggered by anything I could find in my waking life, so I tried to ignore it. It happened a few times I didn't mention to my husband because... why? I didn't want him thinking I was crazy.

About three months ago, we moved to a new place. And these ""sightings"" stopped completely. I'm so grateful. Despite considerable stress in our new home (we're fixing it up) and the stresses of a new job, I haven't had the experience again. I can't help but think it was related to that apartment somehow.

Anyway, I'm all ears if you guys have ideas or suggestions as to whether or not this is paranormal. This is one experience I haven't even told my mother or best friend because I'm not sure how they'll react.

1370844992.0,18,self.Thetruthishere,1g1441,[ME] [FR] An experience in the woods at my friend's house,samm157,22,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1g1441/me_fr_an_experience_in_the_woods_at_my_friends/,"So, I posted this on a website called yourghoststories.com a while back. I got pretty positive feedback from there, but no real answers. Ever since, I’ve been wondering if I’m the only one who has had an experience like this. When I found /r/Thetruthishere, I thought it would be the perfect place to find out. 

Anyway, it all happened three summers ago when I was thirteen. I was at my friend, Kate’s, house and so was another friend of mine, Lisa. We were bored with nothing to do in the house when Kate got an idea.  

Kate had been getting pictures of orbs (Some of which I have because she uploaded them on my computer.) all down her driveway and in the woods by her house at night and she wanted to investigate. I, being the huge fan of the paranormal that I am, was automatically in. Lisa, who at the time did not believe in the paranormal, tagged along to humor us. 

 So, we gathered my laptop, a camera, and mine and Kate’s phones, and then we left Kate’s house to walk down the driveway. She lived on a big piece of land, and it had a very long driveway. We stopped about halfway down the driveway, out of earshot of both houses. (Her grandmother also had a house on the land, but closer to the road). We had to do it this way because her mother was very superstitious about paranormal things. I remember her not even letting us watch movies involving possessions or demons in the house because “That was just asking for something bad to happen.”

Since Kate wasn’t expecting any visitors to the house (And we would’ve been able to see them coming up the driveway long before they reached us even if any showed up by surprise.) we settled down right there on the ground, sitting in the middle of the driveway. On the way down we had decided we’d do an EVP. 

EVP plans in mind, we set up my laptop’s wireless webcam and started to record. Not really having any idea what we were doing, we just asked it some standard “Who are you?” “Can you show us yourself?” type questions. When we were done, we played it back. Nothing. 

That didn’t really discourage either Kate or myself, but Lisa was getting bored, as she didn’t believe in this kind of thing. We tried to get her to be patient, and after a little coaxing, convinced her to be quiet for EVP round two. 

This time we asked a few more questions, but I can’t remember what. I remember not wanting to ask the entity how it died, because I’d read somewhere that you weren’t supposed to do that. 

This time when we played it back, we had something. It was a bunch of whispers between our questions and what sounded like a fence door slamming. Nobody had been whispering and no fence had slammed while we were recording. There weren’t even any fences with doors near by. 

Feeling that we were definitely on to something, Kate and I got exited. We did a third EVP and this time we asked it to be louder. We also asked if it was Kat’s great grandfather, who had died on the property. When we played this one back the whispers were louder as we’d asked, but still not loud enough to be decipherable. 

Kate and I agreed to do one more EVP. This time, Lisa decided she wanted to help. Turns out that by helping, she meant teasing. She taunted the entity, saying that there was really nothing there and that all of this was stupid. Kate went along with it because she wanted whatever this thing was to react. I went along with it out of curiosity. What was the worst that could happen, right? 

We played back the recording again and we got the same slightly-louder but still undecipherable whispers from the third EVP. By now Lisa was getting irritating because she was bored, and Kate convinced me to let it go for then, telling me we’d get back to it later. We decided to give up and go play in the woods. So we walked up to her grandma’s house and I put my laptop and camera in a rocking chair on the porch. Kate and I kept our phones on us and we went to play in the woods. 

For some reason, I remember that Lisa ended up chasing us with a spray bottle of water that she found on the ground. (It’s kind of incredible the random things you can find in the woods.) We were having a great time. Everything was fine, until Kate realized her phone was no longer in her pocket. 

She panicked, knowing her dad was going to be angry if she lost the phone she’d just gotten. She also knew she wasn’t going to get a new one because her sim card was in this one. She asked me if I’d seen it fall out of her pocket and I said no; if it had fallen out I would’ve seen it or stepped on it because I had been running directly behind her in very densely packed woods. Kate still freaking out, we all decided to look for it. 

We’d been looking for it for about five minutes when I saw something that would change my life forever. (This is where things start to get weird.) 

It started out as just a blur in the corner of my eye. At first, I didn’t pay any attention to it. I was on a mission to find Kate’s phone and I thought it was her dog, who liked to come with us on trips into the woods. It was a few seconds before it registered in my mind that Kate’s dog had gone missing about a week before. 

I snapped my head up, the other girls paying no attention to me, as they were digging around in fallen leaves for a lost phone. What stood in the clearing a few feet from me is something I will never forget. 

It was about the size of a large dog (Like I said, at first I’d thought it was Kate’s dog.) with leathery brown skin. It had claws where paws would’ve been if it had been a dog and a strangely elongated face. At first, it’s face was turned away from me, but when it (I assume) sensed I had seen it swiveled its head around to stare at me. Except, it couldn’t stare, because it had no eyes. (It seriously reminded me of something from Silent Hill.) Just a wide mouth. It opened its mouth and after a few seconds a terrible growl reached my ears. 

That growl was horrifying. It seemed to reach the core of my soul. It was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever heard in my entire life, and I hope to never hear anything scarier. 

I was still frozen on the spot when, suddenly, Lisa’s mom drove up and it disappeared. We walked out of the woods and to the driveway, me stunned, Kate and Lisa having no clue what had just happened. 

Kate’s mom was here to get her, but she convinced her to let her stay just a little longer so maybe she could help us find Kate’s phone. Lisa’s mom left to go do something, promising to be back within the hour, I believe. 

Still sort of in shock, I followed the other two girls back into the woods, even though something deep within me told me not to. That was when I heard a second growl, and so did everyone else. We all looked at each other and I quickly told them how I’d seen…something, but I kept a lot of the details to myself so I didn’t sound crazy.

 At this point, Lisa was probably scared, because she had heard the growl this time. Kate was definitely scared too, but torn because she wanted to find her phone. I told her I wasn’t helping anymore, I was sorry, and went and sat on her grandmother’s porch. 

To this day, we rarely talk about what happened. It was half-joking agreed upon that whatever that thing was, it stole Kate’s phone because we’d goaded it on with the EVP. Whether that is true or not, I will never know. 

I hesitate to call this thing a demon, because that sounds to so many people like something that’s not real. But with the fear it gave off, it’s the best word I have to describe it. 

If it makes any difference, I found out not too long ago, from my history teacher that the road Kate lives on was KKK territory, up until at least the 1970’s, and that quite a few people were killed out there. I have no idea if that could possibly have anything to do with what I saw, but it could be what all of the orbs were about. 

So, guys, that's my story. I really hope you believe me, as everything I just wrote is 100% as I remember it.

This is perhaps less of a story than an unexplainable sighting. I used to share this with friends after a few drinks but have learned to not speak of it -- for one, it brings up fear and uncertainty which I don't particularly care to dwell on, and for another, it makes everybody think you've come unhinged. Anyway, here is my somewhat anticlimactic experience.

Fall of 2006 or 2007. I'm on my way home from university for a weekend with the family. The drive home consists largely of paved rural roads through the woods of northern Minnesota. Ditches are well maintained but there are reasonably dense trees and brush just off the right-of-way.

It's night but not pitch-black. Enough to need headlights but still enough light to see the edge of the woods. This is a curvy road which is notoriously underpatrolled, and I'm young and like driving fast, so I'm cruising along at 55-60 through these turns.

So I come around one of these winding turns and, as I do, the edge of my headlights catch a humanoid standing in the long grass in the ditch, maybe 50 feet from my car. As soon as my lights shine on it though, it strides gracefully the 20 or so feet into the adjacent woods, and out of sight.

This thing must have been at least 7 feet tall, taller than a normal man, but standing erect -- clearly not an animal on hind legs. Its appearance was grey, with no hair, and very thin -- thin enough to see joints. If you imagine a stereotypical ""alien"" figure, you have a pretty good idea. And the way it walked was so graceful, it almost glided. So swift but calm. I didn't catch any facial features in those few moments.

This is all I saw. My mind went into full-on red alert mode after seeing this, with the adrenaline rush and everything, and I seriously contemplated stopping to look for the thing or at least some tracks, but my fear and sense of self-preservation won out.

I've bounced around explanations -- a human, some animal, or (perhaps most likely) just a trick of my imagination and fatigue, but nothing totally satisfies my curiosity.

I should add as an epilogue (and this is where it becomes certain that I'm really naive or just cracked) that I shared this with my job supervisor -- a guy with a somewhat crappy past that had sometimes alluded to the paranormal -- and he revealed having experiences with the same type of thing. He called them ""watchers"" and assured me that, as best he could tell, they were benevolent. He went further though, describing more malevolent entities that had, for a lack of better word, haunted him from time to time.

That's all I have. My question to this community then: is there anything like this described in mythology or other sightings? I should say that I'm a Christian and my explanation has settled upon this being some sort of minor demon, but I absolutely will not start researching demonology.

Next to the apartments is a huge field that connects to the forest. There are no lights inside the field, so at night it's pitch black. I go running at night a lot, usually just through town and back. 
So onto the story! About a week ago, I went on a normal late-night jog. I usually go through town, then take a road that's in the middle of some forest-y area, but only got about 1/2 way down it when I got a really creepy feeling. So I turned back early.
As I'm turning into the main road that goes to my apartments, my eye catches something in the forest up ahead. I continue to run down the street, then stop dead in my tracks.
With it's body half - in the forest, and half in the street light, is a HUGE wolf. It had a long, lanky body with a bushy tail. The weirdest thing? It's fur was entirely black. It's just standing there... WATCHING me... 
All I can think.. ""I have to run toward this thing to get back to my apartments..."" when it suddenly turns back into the dark forest and disappears. I don't think, I just sprint towards my complex. As I'm getting closer, I hear the wolf running in the field alongside me for about 5 seconds. It's pitch black on the field and the road so I can't see anything. 
Finally, I run into the streetlight and race up my apartment steps.
1. There are no wild wolves in WA state. We do get coyotes, which tend to look like medium sized, ratty dogs. This thing was definitely HUGE.
2. Black fur on wolves, coyotes, ANY wild dog is extremely rare here. Mostly you will see different shades of grey and white. 

Here's a Diagram showing the street, etc. for a better idea. The red arrow shows where the wolf was standing. http://imgur.com/K91Ucp7
Please tell me what you honestly think. I like to think of myself as a pretty down to earth person, but this experience really shook me up. I haven't gone outside at night since :/

To do this, I would often go outside and sit in the car with the doors locked. 

I lived in a trailer park just off of I-70 in Missouri at the time, and I was far enough into the park that there was a patch of trees about 200 feet from my trailer. I could see it very clearly from my seat in the car. 

This particular night, I was about to hang up and head inside when I saw something odd out of the corner of my eyes right along the treeline. I tell my friend to hold on, just in case something bad was about to happen. And I can't tell you how glad I was that I did. 

Down on the treeline there was a shadow, human in shape. Except it wasn't human. The hair on my arms stood up and I instantly got a headache and felt nauseous. It was running, whatever it was. The run was almost put in slow motion, so it looked very similar to those old cartoon wheel when they spun slowly. There were no details; no face, no fingers, no clothes, no feet, but it stood anywhere between 7 to 9 feet it seemed. It vanished into the deeper shadows of the woods.

Instantly, I felt a menacing pressure, and eyes on me from some unknown person. I tell my friend waht I just saw and that I may be in serious trouble. I turn to my porch (which was about 8 feet away from the driver's side door, which where I was sitting) and there was that *thing* standing directly between my porch and my self. 

I hear a noise down from the gravel road by the woods and I turn to see a car coming up. And I remember very distinctly saying ""Please stay on the line, Corey. I'm making a run for it while this car passes."" As soon as I see the windshield and I was sure that there would be a witness if anything happened to me. 

And I ran faster than I had ran in my life. I managed to get inside and I slept with the lights on that night.

EDIT: Alright guys, I have drawn the picture of ""the shadow people"" as I saw them, however, I only drew one since they were identical.The quality is bad because I didn't have any charcoal, nor did I have access to the scanner so I shot it with my camera. Again, really bad, but as accurately as I could capture it. Keep it mind, there was only the moon and the headlights from that car. Enjoy.

1364755095.0,18,self.Thetruthishere,1bdcbt,[ME] I'll never know what was outside my window,tetewhyelle,30,12,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1bdcbt/me_ill_never_know_what_was_outside_my_window/,"I had actually completely forgotten this had ever happened, until a few nights ago. My roommate, our friends, and myself stayed up really sharing different paranormal things that have happened to us. I lived in two haunted houses in a small town in Florida while I was in high school. The story I'm going to tell does have some room for speculation I'm sure, but I don't personally believe it to have been a person so I don't want to put it in /r/LetsNotMeet .

So when I was 17, we moved into a slightly larger house in the same neighborhood. I have several anything stories from the previous house, but this will be about the newer one. The neighborhood was a gated neighborhood, but it wasn't wrapped in a fence, so I will admit that it is possible for someone to have gotten in. But I also lived on the backmost street in the neighborhood. This isn't the only story I have for this house either, but this is the only one that ever thoroughly terrified me.

It was a really nice house. Every teenagers dream with a pool and hot tub in the backyard. The house was a essentially a large rectangular shape. My bedroom being on the right side of the house, with my window facing out into the side yard and my neighbors house. You can't see the road or the pool deck from my room.

Now, this house had originally been a model house and my room (in my opinion) was horrendous looking. One wall had this really fancy green wallpaper with gold flowers on it. Like the metallic gold too. The walls were a sort of beige color, and there were heavy green curtains over the window. Seventeen year old me was not having that shit at all.

So one weekend, with the help of a friend. We ripped off the wallpaper, painting my room a shocking purple, and took the curtains down. Originally, I had planned on putting up my pale blue curtains, but something prevented me from doing so for a week. Power drill was broken maybe? I don't remember.

My bed was underneath the window so every night I got to stare up at the stars as I fell asleep. It was actually really cool...until my dad hired a lawn care service and let me tell you waking up to people outside your window trimming the shrubbery and shit was scaring enough. So, I put my curtains up finally one night.

That same night, I fell asleep pretty late. Probably around 2:00AM. I was jerked awake at 4:00AM, by something scratching at my window. My first thought was a bird or something, but the sound was....indescribable. I've never heard anything like it before and I hope to never hear it again. 

I had a slider window, where like if you unlocked it and pulled it to the right, the left side would slide open. Hopefully that makes sense. So I'm hearing something catch the metal and then bang into the glass. Over and over and over. It sounded frantic and it would speed up and slow down. Like fingernails grazing over the metal, catching, and then banging into the glass as it lost it's grip. 

I was begging the glass not to break and at the same wishing the sound would stop. I have never been so terrified in my life and I just completely froze up. It felt like hours of the frantic scratching, stopping for a moment, then starting again. But in reality I think it probably only went on for 10 or so minutes. 

When it finally stopped, I listened for anything as an identifier to what I had just witnessed, but there was nothing but silence. It was gone as quickly as it had came without any warning.

I finally was able to get out of bed and move to the opposite side of my room, where I curled up and called a friend. I didn't go back to sleep that night but I also never heard anything again.

The next morning, I checked outside my window. There wasn't a mark despite the frantic scratching and while the dirt looked slightly scuffed, it had also rained on and off through the night. So I was never sure. 

I'll never know what was outside my window. I'll also forever wonder what would have happened if I hadn't have put my curtains up the night. Would I have seen the cause for the sound? Would the sound have ever happened in the first place? I'll probably never know. I have a fear of windows being open at a night now. All my windows are covered in heavy curtains.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1bdcbt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1bdcbt/me_ill_never_know_what_was_outside_my_window/,

I've got a story for you. I was originally considering putting this on r/nosleep as well, but it's true and not necessarily something I'd consider scary. It's the story of who, somewhere down the line, my family playfully dubbed ""Captain Jerry"". My mom was the one who experienced it, as my brother has no memory of the event, so I'll be writing it second hand. 

My mother, who I would consider a very smart woman, has always been interested in cosmology and the extraterrestrial. These days the whole family is a fan of Ancient Aliens and other crazy conspiracy theory series that the History channel airs. Ironic fans, of course. We all know these things are a load of bunk. We tease and joke about every plane in the sky, pointing at them and claiming, ""Look, it's a UFO!"" As you can imagine, we had a field day with the recent meteorite strike in Russia. 

Anyway. One day, over ten years before I was born, my mom had a dream. She was being chased through the house by something, she didn't know what, but it was dangerous and she needed to escape. The presence cornered her at the end of the hallway on the upper floor, and she was trapped. Just as all hope was lost, there was a light, and she didn't know what it was either but it felt safe. It felt like she was being rescued. She woke up.

Later that day, my mom was reading in the living room. She had picked up a copy of *Communion: A True Story*, by Whitley Strieber. The [cover](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ce/Communion_book_cover.jpg) is important. It features the face of a Grey; the standard little humanoid that first comes to mind whenever aliens are mentioned. Large eyes, large heads, small noses, no ears, that sort of thing. Do I personally believe this kind of alien exists? I'd say it's very unlikely that something would independently evolve with all the exaggerated features humans associate with intelligence, but that's beside the point. 

The phone rang. My mom set the book down on the coffee table and went to answer it. On the other end was my grandma, and at some time during their idle prattle my brother came into the room. He was either four or five, I think. He saw the book, pointed at it, smiled and said, ""I know that."" 

In the book, Strieber describes the alien he interacts with as a ""she"". You wouldn't be able to tell by looking at the picture, which lacks distinct feminine features. There's a softness about the painting, I suppose, but otherwise it's ambiguous. 

My mom paused, not knowing what my brother meant. Maybe, she thought, he was referring to the way the book was propped on the table like a tent. ""You know what tents are?"" she asked, but he shook his head. 

""No,"" he said, ""I know that lady."" 

There is no way he would've known the alien was referred to as being female. At this point, my mom became much more interested. ""What? How do you know her?"" she asked, having put her conversation with her mom on hold. 

My brother smiled again and said, ""She was outside my window last night!""  ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_18xv89,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18xv89/fam_captain_jerry/,

For most of my late teens I’ve been a pretty staunch atheist/skeptic and will always looks for some kind of logical or psychological explanation for any sort of “spiritual” or paranormal occurrence. I wasn’t always like that though.  I kind of want to find out if this is a psychological thing or if there are any markers  of something else?

When I was a kid I was…pretty dark…I had a very strong interest in mythology and the occult. I also enjoyed entertaining some very violent ideas and fantasies, and had no problem drawing and writing about these things in detail and showing them to people. I enjoyed frightening people and making them uncomfortable, (most likely at the time to give a sense of power to a lonely kid who was picked on a lot for being shy and meek) the stories I would make up were sometimes so graphically violent I would even terrify myself!

So, like I said, I was very interested in the occult. Particularly demons and the more malevolent creatures found throughout history. I devoured books, movies, documentaries, online archives, any piece of information (or misinformation) I could get my hands on. It started when I was around 11, and I don’t if I was working myself up or if there ended up being some outside influence but sudden I started having these creepy feelings when I was alone, especially when I went to bed at night. There are a handful of instances during this period that really stand out to me (the rest I think really could have been just me.) where I would be lying there just really terrified, certain there was something in the room with me. I never actually SAW anything, not with my eyes open at least, when I shut my eyes I would see flashes of things…Faces mostly. One of the weirder faces I saw was some kind of stone-made creature that had a head in the shape of a 5 pointed star. One of the nights I felt something beside my bed an image quickly flashed in my mind of the lower arms and torso of a pale, nude individual standing right at my bedside. I would not have been able to see any higher because I slept on the lower bunk of a bunk bed and the shoulders and face would have been obscured…I was consumed with terror. When I managed to get up and get the lights on, I was as white as a sheet. This sort of thing kept going on for about 2 and a half, maybe three years. I never told anyone about them because I was scared of how they would react, due to my father’s side of the family being Catholic, and myself at the time kind of fearing and distrusting priests. 

Anyway, when I turned 13, we moved to a new town, and the summer before starting at my new middle school, my mom decided to surprise enroll me and my sister in a Baptist summer camp. Being the ostentatiously creepy little goth brat that I was, I was naturally pretty pissed.

But, they ended up converting me. Literally by the end of a week and half, I was “ON FIRE FOR GOD”, and thought that all of this was a great opportunity to turn over a new leaf and leave all of my dark and creepy BS behind. 

But the creepy BS apparently wasn’t going to go out without a fight.
The afternoon I got home, I was absolutely cheerful, my mind only on God and faith and the all the new friends I had made and the days ahead of me-

Until I walked into my bedroom.

As soon as I walked through the door, something was different, the air felt wrong, suddenly there was a weight on my shoulders. Mind, this was my new bedroom, all of the other weird things that had happened, happened in my old house, and I thought I had left those memories behind. I tried to shrug it off and ignore it, I was only in the room to drop off my bags before going off to dinner anyway.

After we returned home it was pretty late, so we said our good nights and went to bed. I was happy. Sitting on the top bunk of my bed I decided to read the bible before I went to sleep. At this point I started having some tiny creepy feelings but I brushed them, joking with myself as I did. Still, as I lied down and tried to sleep, I couldn't seem to shake this small but persistent feeling of paranoia. I tried to distract myself by focusing on all the good times I had had in the past week. But suddenly the old images seemed to be trickling back, scary images. Naturally this only heightened my feelings of paranoia, but I decided to be proactive, and grabbing a CD of gospel music that I had gotten from a youth pastor. I thought it would work for sure and I would listen to the music and contemplate Christ and get over it!

I was dead wrong. In spite of myself, my feelings of fear began building to a fever pitch. The images in my mind were like some kind of twisted reel that I couldn't switch off. The music didn't seemed to working, and suddenly there was something else in my head too. Screaming, loud, deep, and unintelligible. Too spontaneous and detached to be something I had consciously brought on. I was terrified. I opened my eyes to tell myself there was nothing there and there seemed to be a subtle flashing over my vision. Like a strobe light. (The lights in my room had been off for some time at this point, I was of course, trying to sleep. The only light that came through the slats of my window was moonlight.) The screaming wouldn't stop, the images wouldn't stop, and every time I opened my eyes, the strobing became more powerful and my vision became cloudy, until I couldn't see anything. I was paralyzed with terror, all I could was lie there until I eventually passed out.

That night I had a dream. There was a creature outside in the backyard, it large, totally round, and stood on four stubby legs. It was a deep, flat black, that was featureless and seemed almost two dimensional. It had two beady, bright red eyes. It seemed almost comically cute, but there was something about it that made me know that it was somehow dangerous. I went over to where my mother was, and I remember telling her ""Please stay inside, stay away from the windows, ok?'' I think after a while it must have left. Because I woke up in the morning feeling totally fine. I felt normal, the room felt normal, and I wondered if I would ever experience anything remotely like that again. That was 7 years ago, and nothing like it ever really has.  Still, I told no one about the experience until months later, and has never told my closest friends about it, since many of them are scientists and as skeptical as they come, I worried they would just tease me for it.

However recently I was with them all and decided to describe my final experience and the dream to them. During high school, my friends and I used to trip (as in take psychedelics) a lot together in my house. As soon as I was done describing the thing I had seen in my dream. Two of them that where with me instantly began to exclaim that they had seen such a creature around my house while under the influence.

Also, some creepy events happened after I shared this story on reddit earlier. Also, sorry for the wall of text.
I’ll start off by saying that my family is Lakota Sioux (Native American, for those who aren’t from America). We own land on both the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Indian reservations in South Dakota. My mother is the second to youngest (born in 67) of six children, some of whom still live in South Dakota, while others have moved across the country. 


A little background of my grandparents: my [grandfather](http://i.imgur.com/JTifD.jpg) (is it just me or does he look like Joseph Gordon-Levitt?) did a lot of traveling for a medical company. He always had a camera on him because he took a lot of photographs for medical brochures (some of which included pictures of STDs, my mother unhappily informed me). My grandmother also worked in the medical field, and was a receptionist for a hospital in South Dakota for many years before she retired. They were both well-known and respected in the community. Both of my grandparents had inherited land on different reservations, but they lived permanently for several years on the Rosebud reservation while spending the summers on Pine Ridge. 


At the end of a weekend trip to Pine Ridge during the early 70s, my mother and grandfather decided to go for a walk in the late afternoon. The land is pretty up and down, with hills and valleys and small creeks sometimes running. [Here]( http://imgur.com/a/kH1rL#0) is an album of some photographs my grandfather took of our land and some areas in South Dakota in general. [Here]( http://imgur.com/a/4DYHL#0) are some photographs that I took of our land and of the badlands when I visited during the winter of 06/07. There are a lot of pine trees and brush that provide a lot of seclusion, especially where we live.


Anyways, about a half of a mile away from the main cabin, towards a corner of our land, my grandfather and my mother stumbled upon a roughly built pyre. On top of it was a dead body, wrapped up in some sheets. My mother was pretty young and has some troubling remembering exactly what took place, but she believes he asked her to run back and grab his camera and tell my grandmother while he stayed put.


After she returned, he snapped a photo of the pyre, and then took another one (my mother was not aware that this second photograph was taken) with grandmother, some of my aunts and uncles, and some family friends standing around the pyre, both of which are pictured [here]( http://imgur.com/a/VP5gH#0).

My mother had forgotten about this until very recently. When my grandmother passed away in 2008, she inherited several boxes full of photo slides that my grandfather had taken. She took them with the understanding that she would scan the slides in some day and share the photos with her siblings once she had done so. It was only recently that she had the time to sit down and actually do this. While she scanned them in, she noticed this picture (**please note, she was only aware of the first pyre photo slide at this time**) and called me into our computer room (I’m in college living with my parents) and showed it to me. She said, ""Grandpa and I were out walking on our land one weekend and we just randomly found this. Someone had come onto our land and built it and put that there!"" I didn't realize what was actually on top of it and said, ""Oh, that's cool..."" She gave me a weird look and said, ""German_Jerky... that's a body on top of it."" I was pretty creeped out and asked her several questions afterwards. The first was, what did they do about it?


For those of you who are not aware, state police aren’t allowed to interfere with anything that crosses onto the reservation border because the reservation isn’t legally in state/federal jurisdiction. So, they didn’t call the Rapid City Police (the closest city to the reservation in South Dakota) because they wouldn’t have been able to do anything for them anyways. They also didn’t bother calling the reservation police because Natives are extremely superstitious of things like that, and as my mother put it, “There was no way they’d come and investigate something like that!” I asked her if they knew who it was, and she told me that she didn’t, and that if my grandfather or grandmother did, they never mentioned it. I asked her what happened afterwards. My mom told me that they had to return to Rosebud for the next week, and came back to Pine Ridge the following weekend to find that it had been burned. 

That took place about three days ago. Today, she called me in the computer again in a slight panic, and told me she just got done scanning in some other slides when she noticed that the lamp on the computer desk started randomly flickering. This lamp (which was a gift from a friend and has Native American designs on it) turns on by touch—you touch the base of it multiple times and it increases in intensity. Nothing was touching it when it started flickering. She turned it off and turned it back on, and it continued to flicker. She checked the outlet and it was securely in place. All during this time, she was scanning in a batch of slides. The scanner is a black tower with an open slot in it. The slot is for a plastic tray that fits four slides at a time, and runs it through like a printer, scanning each slide. [All of this can be seen in this picture I took of it today.]( http://i.imgur.com/YNU75.jpg) 

When it finished, she noticed that it only scanned three of the four photos. When she went back and looked at the slides by hand, she noticed that the one that didn’t scan properly was the second pyre photograph. All of this took place while the Native American lamp was flickering… I’m not saying that is irrefutable evidence of spirits, but it’s a pretty creepy coincidence.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I need to clarify anything.

My girlfriend was a baby at the time. She was sleeping in her own room, in her crib, baby monitor at her side. My girlfriend's mom was sleeping in *her* room with the baby monitor at *her* side.

Sometime during the night, my baby girlfriend got tangled up in her blankets, and she started to suffocate in her sleep. She didn't cry out or anything. My girlfriend's mom was woken up to the sound of a woman (I believe they say it was my girlfriend's grandmother, who was dead) calling her name through the baby monitor. My girlfriend's mom went to check on my baby girlfriend and found that she was suffocating, luckily this mysterious voice coming through the baby monitor helped my girlfriend's mom save my baby girlfriend's life.

They checked the house and all around it and nobody was there. The next day my girlfriend's mom called everyone she knew asking if anyone had been to the house and nobody had. It is a mystery up until this day and my girlfriend believes it was her grandma saving her life.

[Pt.2/My families](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/z48nm/fam_a_collection_of_experiences_pt_2/)


I live with my boyfriends family and they (particularily him) have a few strange stories so I thought I'd post them up for you. These are true, certainly mine were (Pt. 1) and my/my partners family don't tend to exaggerate heavily or lie so I believe their stories as well. This is my boyfriends families experiences.


*A quick note on the house*

*My partners parents moved in before their three children, Jack, Amber and Kiera were born. It was a basic Australian family home in the suburbs to begin with but they renovated it to accommodate for their growing family and added on a large rumpus room and downstairs bedroom. They also added a deck and a pool which is more relevant to one of the stories (or at least we tend to think so). The parents room is seperated from the kids by a lounge room and the rumpus/Kieras room by a family room. The 'kids' hallway is where the laundry, communal bathroom and spare room are at the very end of one side of the house.*


Anyway, enjoy (:


**Keys**

When the house was getting it's pool put in the kids used to play in the trench when the workmen went home for the day. This is when they were all about 4, 6, and 7 maybe? Young anyway. One day while making digging up worms or whatever little kiddies would do in that trench Jack hit something hard. He dug it up with his little sister Amber overlooking and uncovered a box. 


They pried it open and inside were a bunch of really old fashioned keys, like those Victorian style ones made out of iron with the butterfly decoration on the end. I've tried heaps to try and get Jack to remember where he put them but all he knows is he carried them off to show someone and has no idea where they were gone, neither does his mum or dad. 


They were just a shitty old set of keys, now that he's 22 you would think that even if his parents didn't want to tell him when he was younger that they'd just chucked them out they'd surely tell him now. I just asked him about it just now actually and he said he might look for them soon, their houses cupboards tend to swallow up stored things.

Anyway! The point to this opening story is that nothing bizarre happened in their house until after these keys were found. (Which sounds like the opening to a horror movie!)


**Laundry**

Not long after the keys were found and lost(?) Their laundry door started acting up, nothing too suss. Until one day Kiera was calling out for her mum, after a few calls she heard her call back, ""Right here honey!"" from the laundry so off she trucked to talk to her. When she got to the washroom though there was an old woman standing in front of the washing machine smiling at her. Needless to say she freaked out and ran all the way to her mums room, and of course when they checked it out again nobody was in the room.


From that experience on the youngest sister would often hear a woman calling her name from the laundry and their mother would occasionally find smalls folded or socks paired that no one admitted to doing (and the kids probably would have been just too small to reach up on top of the cabinet we fold clothes on.)


**Mannequin**

This one I find very hard to believe myself but the tell tale trick to see if my boyfriend is telling the truth is to ask him to swear on his mothers life, he'll never ever do it unless he's telling the truth, he takes it very seriously lol. For this story he swears on his mothers life it was true and adamantly believes he was awake.


One day him and Amber were playing in his room before bedtime. He describes that it suddenly got really cold and where he'd been feeling really jubilant before it was suddenly replaced with a heart clenching feeling something wasn't right. For some reason he looked up at the door and stared at it, his sister who had her back to it had gone quiet.


Jack says that he saw an orange mannequin walk past. It looked like a [wooden man](http://m.cdn.blog.hu/am/amymd/image/pix/jointed-wood-body-form-mannequin-dress-form.jpg) and just went by without looking in or paying any notice of them. After it passed the doorway Amber said quietly to Jack that she felt like something scary had happened and she wanted to see their mum so they jumped up and bolted out of the room together. When they got to her Amber blurted out that she'd heard something really scary. 


**Accident**

This one happened to an aunt of the siblings who lived/s in Perth. One night her daughter (their cousin) went out to a friends house for a birthday party when she was 16. Her mum told her not to be home too late (midnight) because Marie was in her exam period, was known for being a bit wild (but a lovely girl) and they'd also had a fight that day.


At around one o'clock her mother started getting worried or annoyed or just plain thirsty and went to get a glass of water. she looked up at the glass sliding door across from her and saw Marie standing there looking at her ""What time do you call this?"" She called out turning back to flip off the tap and then went to let her in through the sliding door.


When she opened the door though she realised that Marie in fact wasn't there, there was nobody there. Marie never came home, she'd been in a car accident, one of her 18 year old friends had taken her and a few others for a joy ride and they'd totaled the car killing them. We all like to think that she was coming back home to say one last goodbye.


That story gives me chills every time I hear it.


**Scotch**

Jumping forward to when Jack was around 17, he had a mate over Jason. Jason and him had just come inside and were having a 'deep and meaningful' when they both suddenly felt really strange, I'm asking him now (he's reading a book in the lounge room adjacent to me, haha) and he says he can't explain it. It was like an intuitive feeling with mental images bubbling up in his head.


They both went dead silent and without words knew the other was feeling and seeing. What they were. Jason started explaining something about the image he was... receiving? and Jack would finish off his sentences and then start describing the next thing to which Jason would finish off his sentence.


They both agreed that there were a group of men in 1930's clothing drinking scotch and catching up as if they hadn't seen each other for a while. I would have been pretty damn freaked out and the boys were. Our friend Jason thinks he's a bit of a psychic for reasons I haven't really asked him in detail about because I'm pretty skeptical about that sort of thing. Anyway, he closed his eyes and simply said 'please leave' and with that the feeling lifted and their previous jubilation returned without a hint of fear.


**Piano**

My boyfriend is a musical prodigy, he can pick up any instrument, work at it for a week and be able to play a few songs by Sunday. This particular week it was the piano. We have an old upright in our lounge room so he was practicing on that. Out of the corner of his eye he saw an old woman dressed in late 1800's clothing smiling and watching him play, without a doubt he flipped out and fell off the stool trying to unwrap his feet from it. Of course as per usual after the fleeting glance there was nothing there which could have been put down to a trick of light but he saw her again the week after in the same clothes, same smile, same face.


**Creeper**

This actually happened just last week (which is what reminded me I hadn't posted pt. 3 up of my 'collection' up!)


The other night at about 1am we heard someone on the front porch walking up to the door, not thinking anything of it as we live in a 7 person house and Amber was out we naturally just thought it was her especially since the footsteps sounded like her own. You know how you can tell when your mum or dad or sister are walking past your room by the weight/loud/quietness/speed of their step? Just like that. When Amber comes home that late because she suffers from a strain of narcolepsy where she gets heavily lethargic often (but doesn't pass out) her footsteps drag and are really tired. These footsteps stopped about a couple of paces short of the door but that's didn't really worry me because I assumed she was getting her keys out or something.


When the door didn't open I got scared (because I'm a wimp!) but I didn't say anything because Jack was sitting next to me and if something was off he'd move. But low and behold up he gets, muttering he's just going to check the door because he heard something. He switched all the lights on, went outside and checked the garage then came in, locked the front door and laundry and checked the backyard but nobody was there. So we locked everything up tight, closed windows etc. I've had a prowler in the past so I get really worried about security like that anyway.


We finished our movie and went to bed, we always play when we go to bed, especially when Ambers not home - not sexual haha, just play fighting plus we kept hearing strange noises in the house (Jack checked the house a couple of times) so we didn't start to go to sleep until about 2:30 Anyway at about 3-4 am the family dog started freaking out. I got super worried because waking up out of my dreamy state it sounded like Kiera coming up from downstairs screaming or crying.


Jack and I bolted up and ran out, as did his mum and there was the dog freaking out. She's pretty old so she was laying down but her eyes were wide as they could go and darting around like she'd been kicked or something, anything we did she'd whimper at. We calmed her down and when I deemed I couldn't help anymore I went back to bed with Jack to follow soon after.


When I got back into the room as soon as I shut the door and sat in bed this strange scratching noise started in the room, I was hesitant to call out for Jack at first because it sounded like it started on the far corner of the window and if it was someone I didn't want them to know where I was (logic? lol). It moved from one side of the window to the closest corner of the room I was in. Don't get me wrong, it could have been a mouse or a rat, but this moved so fast from one side to the other it was unlike anything I had ever heard in the wall before. It definitely wasn't a possum because we've never heard a possum in the wall and I haven't heard anything since anyway.


The next morning we spoke to Kiera and she said she'd closed her bedroom door but in the morning it was open, in the middle of the night she'd also heard someone walking around outside.


There's probably logical explanations for it all, but it's strange everything fell into one night.


Anyway. That's the full collection of my creepy stories. Looking back at it in text form there's quite a few. I hope someone enjoys them :)

Now this is an old story that happened many years ago in my hometown. 

I live in a quiet little town with a whole lots of woods and montain areas cut by deserted dirt roads. One hot summer night, everybody was enjoying the night at my dad's bar, listening to some music, talking and just being on vacation... 

So, one of the usual customers and his girlfriend at the time decided to go out somewhere quiet and be alone (they both still lived in their parents homes and had no place to just be by themselves if you know what I mean) so they went to the woods in his car: there is an old church the top of a hill where they went and it is a well known lovers lane, place to smoke a joint, etc... The thing is: half an hour later they came back to the bar, their faces pale as a white wall, shaking and just plain scared shitless. 

The whole bar stopped and looked at them asking what had happened and they couldn't even speak. The girl just burst out crying and my father and some of their closest friends went to the bar's kitchen to know what happened to them. They said they were close to the old chapel and that was when they started seeing lights bathing the car, really bright lights. The guy thought it was just another car or their friends doing some prank on them and got out of the car. That was when he realized that the lights came from the sky. 
He looked around and there was blinking lights and shapes coming in their direction from the woods, too. He entered the car and got the hell outta there, full speed on the dirt road. The girlfriend was screaming her head off still and the guy looked in the rear view mirror and noticed the lights in the sky kept chasing them and he heard a sharp hummmmmming noise above. When they arrived at the outskirts of town the lights were gone. 

They just kept going 'till they got back to the bar. They calm themselves and assured my father and their friends it was true. A couple of minutes two friends went to check the guy's car. It was covered in dust from the dirt road. Close to the door handle and in the roof of the car there were marks of long fingered hands, like palm imprints. My older friends (the costumers of my father's bar at the time) invited me to lunch some weeks ago and they recalled that story. 

When the guy who saw the lights arrived at the table, they asked him: ""Hey! remember when you and [girl's name] saw the lights in the sky?"" The guy just told them to shut up about it and to fuck off. Still, I saw fear in his eyes once they asked him about it. Later I asked my friend if he saw the marks in the hood of the car and close to the door handle, too. He said that he was one of the two who went to check the car. He wipe the imprints off and never told him about it. 

My older friends and even my father still tell this story in the winter, by the stove of my father's bar.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_z2y82,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/z2y82/fof_lights_in_the_sky/,

I've had some really chronic migraines since I was in junior high, right now I'm a premed student, 20 years. I had always controlled them through NSAIDs (Anti-inflammatory drugs), until 2 years ago.

That July 23, 2010 (a really bad date in our family) I was feeling pretty bad so I take one pill (it contained ergotamine, caffeine and acetylsalicylic acid IIRC) and go to sleep. I started to notice some weird coughing of mine, I thought I was getting a ""summer cold"" or something, wouldn't be the first time.
I actually tried to sleep, but since migraines don't usually let me sleep immediately, I ignored that too. I then started to ""sleep"" for some minutes. But each time I awoke I knew something was wrong. Until one time I awoke, my eyes were like moved by something else, I didn't knew why I was trying to look to the side of my bed.

There was a little girl, I couldn't notice anything special in her. She had like a ""summer dress"", no decorations or anything. I couldn't see her eyes since my room is freaking dark (My window is covered with a black trash bag to avoid sudden lights from the outside, this due to my migraines too) and she also had long hair. She said in a monotonous voice ""If they had arrived 5 minutes earlier, he would still be alive"".
I didn't give a sh*t about her, but I rushed freaked out to my parents bedroom so my mom could drive me to ER, in the middle of the road I started to have an anaphylactic shock from the NSAID.
With the rush I didn't properly dress so I had too a slight hypothermia xD (I don't know why this is funny, but lol).
Well, obviously I survived, since I'm writing this... (Or maybe I didn't...? jk)

Pretty much that was my story, this isn't my only paranormal story, but definitely is the most relevant... at least for me.

Remember dudes, all them spirits and stuff aren't evil or sometimes neither scary.
If my story wasn't well structured or you have any doubt, just damn write it, like you didn't care about my opinion.

Different cultures, different  countries. I was ghost thirsty last night and decided to go around and ask my fellow residents if they have any good stories. Most of them were lame or drug-induced, but one I heard this morning, from an extremely unlikely candidate, was a real gem. So here goes.

When she was in her late teens, she, her three sisters, and her mother moved into a house in the city (don’t want to be overly specific, but it’s a rather historic city in MA.) As soon as they saw the place, she and her sisters immediately gave their mom strange looks. Why? Well, there were all sorts of religious paintings and pictures all throughout the house. Lots of them. And….sevens. The number 7. Scrawled on the walls, sevens fashioned out of wood and even nailed TO the walls—they were even, she said, in the bathroom. Apparently, the previous tenant was highly religious so they left it at that, even though they thought it was super weird.

So they settle in and go about their lives, and then something happens that freaked the hell out of her. She’s falling asleep in a room with no light sources on and…all of a sudden sees a shadow dart across her wall. Again. And again. And again and again and again, over and over. She said it looked like the profile of a face. Specifically, of a man with a long, pointy nose wearing a large, floppy hat. This got to the point where it frightened her so much that she just stopped sleeping in the room entirely. Later, she mentioned that the shadow would appear frequently, but on specific nights. I’ll get back to that in awhile.

The next thing she said that stood out was the day that she was helping her mother pack some things. They were downstairs in a room, she and her mother. There was one other person in the room, but he was sleeping. She was packing things and all of a sudden something tugged her hair. The way she demonstrated this happening was all too real to imagine. She reached up, tugged the underside of her hair just enough so that her head tilted slightly. Naturally, her reaction was “Ow! Mom!” but her mother hadn’t pulled her hair. They even woke up the sleeping fellow to question him about it and obviously he had no idea what they were talking about. 

The third thing she mentioned was what got me. She was laying on her stomach in bed with her feet dangling off the side, on her phone….when something first pulled off one shoe and then the other. At first she assumed it was her little sister and looked under the bed. No one there. An exploration of the house revealed one sister in the shower, another sister cooking in the kitchen, and the third sister on the other side of the house with her headphones in, intently writing music. None of them could have done it, the shoes she was wearing weren’t the type that just fall off. 
She mentioned that most of the activity, primarily the shadow on the wall, happened the night before she was supposed to go to church. At the time, she took it as “oh, well, I better not go to church, then,” even though her mother was the religious type and insisted when she relayed the experiences that she ought to go. I feel that this is significant with the sevens and all the religious portraiture around the house. Maybe whoever lived there before them felt like they needed to be protected from something. That’s the vibe I get, anyways.

I don’t think this girl was lying about anything. She seemed legitimately rattled as she told me what had happened in that house, even had broken out into goosebumps at certain points of the story, like the shadow. You just can’t fake a physical reaction like that. She even said something after she told her tale which made me believe her. 

“When people talk about ghosts and stuff, I’m like, “whatever.” When people talk about God, I sort of believe, sort of don’t believe, mostly don’t, but then I realize that I’m that weird person with ghost stories too. My sisters said they had some stuff happen too, but we don’t know what was up with that house.”

A lot of people are on overnights this weekend, but I’ll continue my quest if people are down to hear more. I think this is fun. It’s been a cool way to connect with the people I live with and very interesting to boot. I just wish that the girl who was from Haiti still lived here. She must have had some great stories.

So let's set the scene with a long rambling story! I'm hanging out at my friend Mike's house, and our other friend Gina is with us. Mike's place was pretty much a hangout spot for our group of friends since he had a cool basement for us to chill out in, and his Dad didn't really care too much about what we did. Mike liked to dabble in the occult a bit, and about a week before the day I was hanging out there he did some sort of ritual in the backyard that involved a cows skull. In the ritual Mike drew a circle in salt or something to protect everybody, and my one friend swore that he saw a wolf outside the circle. I just ignored this, since this one guy was prone to making shit up. We did this sort of stupid shit all the time due to growing up in suburbia and not doing drugs like normal kids. 

Anyway Mike, Gina, and myself are hanging out in the house...probably bored. So we end up bringing the cow skull inside for whatever dumb reason. Moments after we do this there is a weird power surge in the house. The living room TV (which was not on) makes a popping sound and begins to smoke. All the light bulbs in the house start burning in a strange way. They dim down all the way so we can just see the filaments glowing red, and then amp up to full power and back again. 

We start freaking out, and Gina I remember was screaming. We tried turning the TV on and off, but it was broken...and the lights keep going up and down. I remember being a little freaked out, but not overtly scared so I tried to scare Gina when we were exploring the rest of the house. Every room that had a light on was doing the same thing...and there was no sign that it was stopping.

For some reason we decide that it's from the cow skull Mike used in the ritual, so he brings it outside and smashes it. Once he does that everything goes back to normal. We're kinda freaked out, so we decide to get the hell out of there and high tale it to the diner, where the staff probably hates us since all we order is coffee and stay for hours. 

Now the next day Mike got yelled at by his Dad big time. They had a little side apartment on their house that they rented out to keep the property taxes down. The tenant (who I remember being a pain in the ass) complained that we were being extremely loud. Apparently there was no power surge in his side of the house, and he just heard us screaming our heads off. Mike's Dad believes him (since all the TV's in the house were now broken) and has the power company come out and take a look....they find nothing out of the ordinary. 

Really strange...I always wondered if something weird caused this, or if it was just a run of the mill power surge that coincidentally began and ended with good timing. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_s0s7y,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/s0s7y/strange_power_surge_me/,

These things still happen and it is about a month later now, but less frequently.

This isn't so much a typical [1] /r/nosleep story as it some ""odd.."" things that have been happening for the past few weeks, things that just have never really happened to me, and things that I just don't get maybe it's my mind or maybe it is something that follows me, I have no idea really. Bare with me as I may ramble a bit.

It started about 3 weeks ago at around 3:30am, I woke up for no real reason that I can think of, but it wasn't one of those normal wake ups, it was that startled awake feeling you have when you're having a dream and you fall off a cliff but the second you are about to hit the ground you spring awake to that fully aware state. I know for a fact I never had one of those dreams or anything that would have woken me up, as far as i remember there was no dream to speak of, either way I was awake and there was nothing putting me back to sleep. So I laid there for a bit watching TV thinking about something to do that didn't involve getting up and leaving bed, my wife was still asleep at the time and I didn't want to wake her up playing video games, then I got pretty hungry and decided I should go get something to eat. Now this is where everything went downhill, I got out of bed and got dressed but as I opened the door I felt...odd, like someone was staring me down, not with hate or anything just like you kind of stare at the hipsters in the mall thinking ""wtf is wrong with these kids today?"" I just went about my business being very aware of the feelings and not letting them get the better of me. I didn't really feel like cooking anything at that hour so I decided I would go get a sandwich down the road at Tim Horton's. I got in the car backed it into the alleyway, as there is no driveways out in front of the house here they put all the parking spaces in the alley but neglected to put lights out there.

I started my way down the road but still couldn't shake the feeling of someone watching me, and then I saw it not directly but out of corner of my eye, someone sitting in the back seat right in the middle, so I immediately snapped my head around to see what the hell was in my car, but there was nothing. My mind jumped right to rationalizing the situation and said it must have been something in the back (I drive a Jeep so the trunk is not actually a trunk and the backseats have removable headrests) but then I looked in the rearview mirror and there's nothing that could be confused with what I saw. At this point I'm losing it, but the thing was not there so I played it off as nothing, I was out for about 45 minutes after and saw nothing appear in the mirror again. When I arrived home again I parked back in the alley and started for the back gate, the fence stands about 5 foot tall in the back so I can see over it very clearly, when I got inbto the backyard I had this stupid feeling that I should turn around, I really wish I hadn't now but I did, and what I saw turned my hair white because I've never been privy to such experiences in my life. But what I saw in the front seat of my car was a person, this was no person I had ever laid eyes on before because most people don't look like they are decaying as if they were dead, buried for a few months and then started walking again as if nothing had happened, I'm not very good at writing details out but that is the best description I can think of to explain what I saw, and it was all made clearer by the dimming lights in the car as they stay on for a minute after locking up. I stared at this ""person"" for the entire minute those lights were on to make sure, hell I don't what I was staring for what was I going to do if this thing came at me? I wanted to run but my brain has a different agenda, once the lights turned off in the car the person was gone. It took me a few days to come to terms with what I saw, and as nothing else put me on edge for those few days I loosened up a bit.

A week after this incident I went back to work, now I work night shifts as security for high rise office towers, and these buildings can get spooky on the best of nights, as the lights are never on and we have to check every floor of the building even the shitty dark corners. When I went in that night I was pretty uneasy about it all as I'm the only person on duty in a completely vacant building, but I had to work. I started checking the building at around 2:30am, and everything seemed rather normal to me, I was a little dodgy but nothing out of the ordinary happened. Then at around 3:15am or somewhere around there I got to the 15th floor and things got weird again. A few of the floors had lights that you can operate manually while others have timers, the 15th had manual controls so the lights were on the entire time on the floor. It started with innocent noises, like someone was walking behind me the whole time, maybe like 6 feet behind me, I kept telling myself that it was just the ccarpet and my shoes. Then I would see things moving in offices as I passed by their frosted floor to ceiling window divides.

""Nope, It's just in your head"" I kept telling myself.

Well once again I couldn't have been more wrong because after coming to the end of this corridor I took the turn to go down the other side of the building and there it was, that...thing...that...person? It was standing at the very end of the hall in the last office down just standing there, staring at me. We both just stood there frozen in time, like two cowboys waiting to draw pistols, we stood there for what felt like 30 minutes at least, then it just stepped sideways out of view into the office. I'll be honest I never bothered to go see where it went I just thought to myself.

""It's down there, you're down here keep it that way""

I walked off that floor and sat in the well lit lobby for the rest of the night looking at cute kitten pictures over on [2] /r/aww to try and draw my attention away from that feeling of that thing staring at me. This continued like this for the next week at work, I would see it and then it would just..go away (I hate the term disappear, because things don't just disappear) it never said anything or did anything, it would just stare at me then go away, to some this just isn't scary but the way it looked just sent chills down my spine every time. I have see that thing maybe 5 more times since in different places, even saw it once downtown in the middle of the day, just staring at me, the last encounter was about a week ago now. But I'm sure it is still watching, studying, planning? As that uneasiness just never went away.

Now I'm sure reading this it may not seem like it is overly scary, but I dare you to put yourself in my shoes with seeing this shit that I never asked for, and see how you would react. I do really wish this was a work of fiction as it still scares the shit out of me, but I also thought that nothing like this has every really happened to me, and as long as nothing bad happens then I can tick it off the bucket list.

However, there has only been one occasion where I actually came to some sort of serious physical harm. This was at my friend's house, where I was rooming.

The house is located in a mid-sized city in Southwestern Ontario. He was separated from his wife and needed someone to help out with the mortgage while they sorted their affairs out, so after some cajoling I agreed to move out of my apartment and into his big, roomy old turn-of-the-century house. It was in a better neighborhood and was really spacious, so eventually I figured ""All right, what the hell, I'll do it.""

My friend had spoken before of hearing footsteps when alone in the house, and doors closing by themselves, and all that other sort of my-house-might-be-haunted stuff. He thought that the culprit was the spirit of a man who had died in the house in the late Seventies (as far as we knew, he died of old age), a tough old bird who had been a Colonel in the Army, then a principal at a local school upon his retirement from the Forces. His initials and a date (June 1955) were carved into a door frame in the basement. Because of my own previous experiences I was inclined to believe him, but had never heard anything there myself - until I moved in. Within weeks, I was occasionally hearing deliberate footfalls creaking across the upstairs hall, bangs and knocks on the walls, and every now and then a door that had been left open would suddenly slam shut. I could usually rationalize most of these things to be drafts and the settling of an old house, but not always. It was a bit unnerving at times, but often I would just ignore the phenomenon or explain it away to myself, and continue on watching TV or whatever.

When winter came a few months later, the friend (who was an industrial electrician) landed a job in the Cayman Islands. He was going to be gone for at least four months, and I agreed to watch the house and carry on in his absence. Soon after he left, the disembodied sounds and aforementioned disturbances began to occur at an increasing rate, and they grew both louder and stronger. Especially at night, usually around two in the morning, when I was trying to freakin' sleep.

It goes without saying that I was getting weirded out by this shit. It was extremely disquieting, for example, to awaken in the pitch black of night to the sound of heavy boots clomping on the hardwood floor of the hallway past my bedroom door and down the hall into the walk-in closet, the closet door then slamming shut behind ... it. I could explain away creaking floors and far-away thumps no problem, but those were fucking FOOTSTEPS, loud and clear and unmistakable. They had weight behind them. Remember, I was all by myself in the house when this stuff was happening. Often, I was scared into gooseflesh and involuntary shivers, and sleep was a long time coming. At the same time, I found it to be also quite irritating. I was tired and edgy from being repeatedly ripped out of a deep sleep by random bangs, footfalls, and shit being knocked off of shelves to the floor. Alone in the large empty house, I began to find myself talking to ""the Colonel"", as we had dubbed him. I'd snap at him, ask him to please stop, ask him what the hell his problem was, and even curse at him.

Bad idea? I wasn't physically afraid of the presence, really, just frightened by the unknown and frustrated enough to be speaking out loud to an entity that (reason would dictate) might not actually exist. I'm in no way, shape or form a ghost hunter or paranormal investigator, and I wasn't about to run around the house late at night with a sound recording device and camera, asking generalized questions in an effort to communicate with an ethereal being. I just wanted some piece and quiet at night, and to not be scared shitless quite so regularly.

During one particular eventful April evening, I got fed up enough to get dressed and, turning all the lights on as I went, systematically searched the house for ... I don't know exactly. Something. I found that a fair number of small items had been knocked to the floor around the house, and (this was eerie) a very old, very rusted pen knife with a fake pearl handle on the stairs leading up to the attic. I had been up in the attic not long before and didn't remember seeing it there, laying open on the middle of the first step. I decided to not go up there, put the pen knife down where I found it and went to bed, muttering to myself and to the Colonel about being tired, jittery and pissed off.

I awoke the next morning a sad, exhausted, cranky mess. An angry leap had me out of bed and I stomped into the hall in my underwear. Emboldened by the sunshine that cheerfully illuminated the hallway, I proceeded to curse out the Colonel righteously. I ended my tirade to the empty hall with, "" - so fuck right off, Colonel!"" I went to the bathroom, took a piss, came out and started down the stairs. When my foot hit the second stair two things happened at once - the chandelier hanging at the bottom of the stairwell shook and chattered, and something gave me a hard push between the shoulder blades. I pitched forward face-first, clutched for the railing, half-grabbed it and tumbled on my side down most of the stairs. The wind was completely knocked out of me, and I was in shock. The fuck? I laid there on the steps with my feet on the floor and struggled to get a breath in.

Upstairs, I heard a door unlatch, creak open, then shut again hard.

I can't describe to you the sheer panic that slammed into my heart, the steel-flavored terror that flooded my mouth, as I finally absorbed what had just happened. It hurt like a bastard, but I lurched up to my feet and limped to the front door and went out to where the sun and fresh air and sanity was, on the front porch. It was briskly cold and a strong breeze was blowing, but I laid myself down in a patch of sun, semi-concealed from the street by the skeletal arms of the bushes that grew around the big wooden porch. I curled up there in my underwear until I stopped shaking from the fear and started shaking from the cold. I decided to convince myself that I had slipped. I did this because I had to; I had no where else to go at this point, and in the slanting sunlight it was easy to talk myself out of the idea that a ghost had just tried to do me grievous bodily harm.

When I went back inside, I said loud and clear, ""I'm sorry, Colonel."" Then I had a look at my bruises, and had a hot bath. Nothing else happened that day, and that night I forked out money to sleep at a crappy little hotel. When I came back the next day (sore and throbbing all down my left side) nothing was amiss in the house, and after that the activity quickly subsided back down to ""aw, that was just the wind"" type levels.

I tried not to think about what had happened to me on the stairs that morning.

In April my friend got back from the Caymans. A few months after that, I moved in with my girlfriend, and he sold the house and moved himself. I told him about the weird shit that had happened while he was gone, but I never told him about being shoved down the stairs by the Colonel. I saw no point in scaring him like that. I reasoned that my antagonistic mouth and vulnerable position of being alone was what had precipitated the act, anyway. However, I sometimes found myself daydreaming this scenario; my friend arriving home and opening the front door to find my rotting corpse sprawled at the bottom of the stairs, neck broken, swollen filmy eyes bulging ...

Oh, yeah, almost forgot - the next time I opened the door to the attic, the pen knife that I had found on the first stair was gone.

I'm not sure but I was possibly younger. My brother and I shared a room and we had a computer in the house. We played Quake 3 and it was pretty fun.

I watched him play with bots while i sat on the bed which was closest to the computer. The computer was beside the doorway so it was visible to see part of the living room (lived in a pretty small house).

In the living room a light shone on the wall directly opposite to the bedroom doorway. The thing I had a habit of doing was looking outside the room to reassure myself nobody was watching (or sometimes to look out for my parents because we were up at 3am playing vidya). Basically it was just a habit. This time it was different as I saw a shadow of a hand in the light that shone on the wall that was opposite to the bedroom doorway.

The hand looked like it was wearing a long sleeve but all I saw was half of the forearm. I FROZE and just watched it. I couldn't believe my eyes. It was just moving around like twisting in a natural movement like how you would move your hand around in the sun when you feel like you need to dry your hand (I dont know if anybody else does this but it feels good). My brother saw it, looked twice but continued playing. 

My brother told me in the morning that it was a branch because he checked after i fell asleep but i know that he's lying because it clearly looked like a hand. It disappeared when my father got out to use the bathroom and came back afterwards when he was back in his room. I fell asleep after watching it for a while. I closed my eyes and pretended it wasn't there and I fell asleep.

That was the first and the last ""paranormal"" thing i experienced but earlier, like a few years before that incident, my older brother saw the shadow of a hand behind the curtains in the living room at night. He drew the curtains and nothing was there. He freaked out during lunch time on a Saturday but my parents just brushed it off as nothing. (Parents don't want to discuss stuff like that).

1325266116.0,20,self.Thetruthishere,nwfd3,Get back to the road,Ensifearthem,21,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/nwfd3/get_back_to_the_road/,"I'm writing this on my netbook from my friend's living room. The current time is 11:20 a.m. I'm seventeen years old and I live in Toronto, Canada. Two of my best friends and a handful of other friends and aquaintances live in a bedroom community about an hour's drive or train ride outside of the city. I don't get to see them often at all because of school, so on Wednesday night I took the train down with the intention of staying until sometime on Saturday. 

I and a lot of my friends are nature lovers, and conveniently there's a large semi-maintained forest of about 10 square kilometers or so literally down the road from my friend's house. For the sake of clarity, I'll call this friend Ian. On the opposite edge of the forest, if one follows the main trail, is my other friend's house. For the sake of clarity, we'll call him Allen. We spend a lot of our time in the woods when I'm in town, and it's not unusual for us to disappear inside for hours at all hours of the day and night. Often we'll make campfires in a fire pit in the open clearing near the centre of the forest. It's technically illegal, but we're safe about it and I think it's mostly tolerated.

The forest is fairly large and comprised of both deciduous trees and evergreen trees. It's a pretty fair mix. In certain places the forest is very swampy, especially near the various river that wind through the place. In some areas the trees actually knit together and it's dusky even on a sunny day at noon. Despite this, I've never felt unwelcome or afraid in the woods, even at night. It's always felt like a very safe, peaceful place. We rarely encounter other people, and when we do it's usually dog walkers during the day.

Besides Allen and Ian, one other friend was with us, and had been hanging out with us since Wednesday night. For clarity's sake, I'll call him Lewis. We'd stayed at Ian's the night before last (Wednesday) and then Thursday morning had trekked through the woods in the daylight to Allen's house. By the time we had made it through, Allen and I were exhausted and we realised that we were both ill with a cold or something. We had fevers and just took it easy and rested for the afternoon at Allen's house while Lewis and Ian went for a walk. By around six o'clock we decided he wanted to head back to Ian's (Allen's house is very small and we don't usually stay there overnight) and thankfully Allen's mum was on her way out anyway, so she offered to give us a ride. We arrived at Ian's and ordered a pizza. Wednesday night had been bitterly cold and there was a fair amount of snow, so we weren't certain if we wanted to go out into the forest, especially with how Allen and I were feeling. 

We were sitting in Ian's basement, listening to music and drinking cider and just shooting the shit. At about 11:00, his parents came downstairs and informed us that they'd just been out and that it was pretty mild and that if we wanted to go to the woods tonight would be a good night for it. Despite feeling a bit feverish, I was getting stir-crazy and felt like I was up for a walk, even if we didn't walk all the way through.

So at about 11:30, we set off for the woods.

I believe in spirits. There's not really an easy way to sugar-coat that. I think there are certain things beyond the kenning of humanity. Are they quantifiable by science? Perhaps. But not right now. I think some people have a more astute ability to tune in to things like that, and I don't like to discuss it because I know a lot of people think that sort of thing is bullshit. That having been said, I've never felt any sort of spiritual energy inside of the forest. It's a very quiet place in that respect. Allen and Ian have both had encounters with coyotes in the summer, but beyond that the forest has never seemed like a threatening or unsafe place.

I don't scare easily. I'm not afraid of the woods or of the night outdoors, especially not with three other people around. Last night, though... Something seemed off. Something just seemed strange, different and a bit nightmarish as soon as we walked in. I have extremely poor eyesight, even with my glasses on. I'm nearsighted so I only really have trouble with far away, and since it's normally so dark in there, I didn't even bother putting my glasses on. With or without glasses, I have awful night vision and usually rely on my friends for keeping an eye out for me. Probably because of my bad eyes, I have the best hearing out of anybody in the group.

We got about 10 minutes into the woods. Lewis and Allen were farther ahead of Ian and I. All was quiet, and it was so bright because of the snow on the ground that we didn't even need a flashlight. We passed a family of deer and stopped to admire them. After about five more minutes, just on the edge of where the trees began to thicken and the lights from the road were small twinkles on the edge of the horizon, I stopped to take a piss and to switch off my music. Normally we listen to black or folk metal when we walk around in the woods at night, but today I just felt sort of unwelcome. Unwelcome is the best way I could convey it. I felt like we were being watched, and there were just really profound bad vibes coming from every direction. I felt like playing music, even something soft like folk music or ambient would just be inappropriate, like shouting in a library. I'd never felt like this in those woods before. I didn't say anything when we first entered, which is unlike me since I'm prone to trusting my gut above all else. 

I stopped to piss and just as I was undoing my fly I caught something above the din of the music coming from my telephone. I froze and shut it off and turn and motioned for Ian, who was standing behind me, to be quiet. Allen and Lewis were still about 20 metres up the path. I took my hood down to hear better. I heard it again. It was the unmistakable sound of a moan. I turned to face Ian and we locked eyes for a second. I slowly did my fly back up and turned to face Lewis and Allen farther up the path. Ian called for them to come back while I scanned the trees around us, trying in vain to keep my eyes peeled. They turned and walked back to where we stood. We asked them if they had heard what we did, and they shook their heads. Then we heard it again, closer this time. It didn't sound human, nor did it particularly sound like any animal I've ever heard, though it could have been a coyote. Though if it was a coyote, why hadn't the deer moved? I could still spot their sillhouettes if I squinted; they weren't more than 40 metres or so away. 

Like I mentioned before, I don't scare easily. But at this point, I could feel shivers going up and down my spine. I looked over my shoulder and turned back to the group. I informed them that we had to leave. We stood in a group for a moment before turning on our heels and heading back the way we had come. All the while I felt this deep feeling of being watched and reviled, as if I didn't belong there.

We finally made our way out, but for the rest of the night I was fairly shaken. I can't even really explain what happened; I hope my retelling was coherent. Was it a coyote we had heard? I don't know. To be frank, I don't really want to know. Humans have instincts; we're animals too. All I know is that something last night in those woods wanted us out, and that was all the notice I needed.

**Tl;dr** Went for a trek last night in the woods on the edge of my friend's town; something wanted us gone.

I'm not.  I can't prove it to you, but you're more than welcome to skip over my stories if you don't believe me.  I don't need anyone to believe me, I'm simply sharing my stories of family's experiences for those who are interested or those who can relate.**



I believe I've already established that my mother lived in what was almost like a medieval place. Her village in Galicia, Spain, was much like the past. There were no street lights, everything was dark when the sun set, no one had cars, really, etc. In fact, many parts of Galicia still live like that, particularly in the mountains. There are still oxen with wagons to carry the harvest, tiny houses with no gas or electricity or running water, that stuff.


Galicia is known for it's 'witch' history. Even after the Romans came, they never fully conquered that part of Spain. They instilled Catholicism, but people to this day still retain their pagan traditions. In decades past, people were much more superstitious, believed in witches and all that stuff. They descend from the Celts, so you get the gist.


So needless to say, strange activity, particularly in days past, days of the dark, was an everyday thing. Very fascinating stories from that time period.


This one in particular was when my mother was about 12 or so. One of her cousin's, Esperanzita, was home because her grandmother had gotten a little ill. She was taking care of her, but my mom and her mother decided to pay a visit, since they were family. Nothing serious, just dropping by for a chat, something very common in small villages like that.


As soon as they got to the house and Esperanzita opened the door, my mom and grandma noticed the heavy smell of candles. A burning wax type of smell, which carries a meaning in our culture. You know how each culture has it's own beliefs and interpretations of things like dreams and such.


Before being alarmed, they tried to rationalize the situation and asked her ""Oh, did you just have candles on?""
'No, I haven't had any candles on at all today, why?'
My mom became nervous and my grandma picked up on it, so she spoke for them.


""No reason. So how's your grandmother doing? I heard she became a little ill?""

'Oh yeah she's upstairs. Come up, she's been awake all day, I'm sure she'd love your company.'

My mom froze at the bottom of the stairs. She looked at my grandma and told her she didn't want to go, she didn't like the feeling she was getting. My grandmother understood, and told her to wait that she wouldn't be long anyway.

Shortly after, my mom heard my grandmother yell out. Esperanzita's grandmother's was dead when they got up there. That's what the smell of burning wax means to them, that someone is either dying or dead. A little illness that seemed like nothing more than a cold, no one expected the outcome.
Except my mother and her mother.

I just got a puppy, I've had him for nearly 6 months now, but he's a bit odd.  Ever since he was a little puppy, he would get very suspicious at seemingly nothing, barking at corners of the room etc.  It would be common to see him look into a corner, growl at it, then bark and run to the door as if he'd just chased someone out.  It's cute, but kinda creepy lol.  And he would always do it, walk into a room, head would snap to look at something, and he'd just growl the way a dog growls when he spots a cat or a strange person etc.

Anyway, 2 recent examples which I think were both interesting.  

I was lying in bed the other morning, next to my bed is a back door that leads to my back yard.  I could hear my dog outside playing, but I could also hear a quiet girl's voice talking to the dog.  I thought no big deal maybe it's mum or my sister, but I peaked a look at him (he couldn't see me watching) and he was just playing by himself, and then he stopped pretty abruptly and looked quite confused, and then just walked off to lay down.  There have been other times, where I've watched him in the yard and he looks like he's playing with an imaginary friend lol but that in itself is nothing unusual for a pup.

Then last night, he came into my room through the door that goes through to the living room, while I was laying on my bed reading, and his attention instantly snapped towards the other door, the door leading outside.  The door was shut, but he started off as a low growl, then loudly snarling and barking, so viciously, I'd never heard him sound like it before, he had his hackles raised and was bearing his teeth, pacing back and forth in my room watching the door like a hawk not taking his eyes off it.  I was trying to calm him down and call him over, but he was so focused he wouldn't listen.  He was making so much noise my dad came in to see what was happening, and he tried to coax him over but my dog was just going totally mad at the door.  After a minute or so of my dog going off, I got up and opened the door, he ran straight to the threshold of the door, barked a few times while looking out into the yard, then it died down to a growl, and then tapered off and he settled down.  I've never seen him get like that before, I've seen him bark and growl before, I've seen him act with strange dogs, when they get up and bark and growl to scare each other off, but he was a lot more intense this time.

The only reason I'm writing this second-hand experience is because of my dad. He doesn't believe in anything paranormal and he isn't easily scared (1.9 meters tall, heavy built man, has been in war, saw a lot of nasty stuff) and usually he makes fun of my mom when she speaks of some other strange occurrences that happened to her.


This happened on the [Day of All Saints](http://www.krakow-poland.com/i/cms/wszystkich_swietych_cmentarz.jpg) - very big Catholic Holliday, when families go to the graves of their loved ones and light candles and bring flowers, so at night whole cemetery is illuminated by candle light.

On this day (first day in November) my dad and mom were wrapping up their tour of the graveyard, as darkness was beginning to fall on the cemetery, and most (if not all) of the people were gone home.


I'll describe it in my fathers words:

**""First we heard sound of something dragging along the concrete path between rows of the graves. Suddenly a small girl dragging four wheel cart begin to appear and she is humming some indistinguishable melody. Full figure of this small (about 7 y. o.) child could be seen, except for her feet. I begin to walk behind her at approx. 50 meters distance, while my wife freezes in her place and all she said was- Don't leave me her alone.**

**Soon I was on the same pathway as the little girl, I was making quite large steps but the distance between us kept getting greater, which was very odd. She was sort of hovering over the ground at about 20 centimeters and accelerating. I begin to run behind her like in some sort of trance, but the girl inexplicably was further and further, until she disappeared behind distant slope which ended by the cemetery fence. I looked around but the girl was nowhere to be found.""**
 
Now, that evening when they came back from the graveyard, and my dad told me what happened, I saw for the first time in my life fear in my dads eyes, and I believe every word he said.

Since then I often think about it- trying all kinds of rational explanations, but I've come empty handed.

I would appreciate TTIH Redditors opinions. 


Edit: When my sister and I were just kids, she woke up one night and came running screaming in to my room, waking me up. She said she saw a little girl crouching in her room. I dismissed it thinking she has had a nightmare.
In years to come she had a number of these strange and unexplained occurrences, but I never gave it too much thought.

If not, hey, no harm done.

Anyway, just to provide for you a bit of background, I'm a traditionalist Catholic, university student, and I've always had a certain interest (more or less over the years) in those things that we can't quite prove with science, like the ideas of ghosts, extraterrestrials (more so when I was younger), hauntings, exorcism, etc.. When I wrote this blog post I was trying to analyze in depth the possibilities regarding the nature of hauntings, from my traditionalist Catholic perspective.
It's a perspective that I don't expect everyone here to share, or maybe even most of you, but I'd ask you just to keep an open mind. I usually write for a primarily Catholic audience, so there may be assumptions in my essay that you won't necessarily share, and that's exactly the kind of thing I'd be more than happy to discuss.

Without further adieu, here's my post. I'll split it into parts if I need to.

Catholic Teachings on Ghosts

A look at the concept of ghosts from a Catholic perspective:


Introduction

The subject of ghosts and the paranormal is one that interested me as a kid, but as I grew older I began to doubt how well the entire subject fit within a traditional Catholic perspective. Common sense certainly seems to allow that some sort of paranormal entities could exist, and could interact with us (after all, for God all things are possible), however the Christian eschatological sense seems to introduce some doubt. We wonder what reasons God may have for allowing a deceased human soul to return to our world, or more troubling still, a damned soul. Such questions require first a strong faith in the teaching authority of the Church, and second an unshakable belief in God's goodness, even when we may not understand His actions.
I will begin by quoting a passage from Exorcism and the Church Militant by Rev. Thomas J. Euteneuer. While I'm very troubled by the rumours I've heard regarding his conduct, his information is still solid and may be accepted regardless of his own difficulties.


Exorcism and the Church Militant
Pages 103-104:
""Most pagan societies believe in the separation of the soul from the body and an afterlife. This includes the idea that souls may ""linger"" after death due to ""unfinished business"" such as unbroken attachments to the earth, to unreconciled relationships or to the affairs of men that supposedly last beyond the grave. In this view, the souls can be benign or malicious; often pagan traditions of ancestor worship or appeasement of the dead are the result of these beliefs.
""The Roman Catholic belief is categorically different from these pagan beliefs, however. The theological tradition concerning souls in purgatory is based on the belief that bodily death constitutes a definitive entrance into an afterlife which is either a temporal purification followed by heaven, or an eternal damnation. Thus, for Catholics there is no such thing as a ""lingering"" or ""wandering"" soul who has ""not cut the bonds of this earthly life."" For Catholics, there is another way to explain these things than the standard pagan reasoning.
""A strong theological tradition recognizes that deceased human souls can and do visit the living after death for various reasons and in various modes. It is clear that this is only done ""according to the disposition of Divine providence"" and not as a common occurrence. St. Thomas Aquinas says that ""separated souls sometimes come forth from their abode and appear to men..."", and this can be both for ""intimidation"" (i.e., damned souls) or for ""instruction"" (i.e., redeemed souls). He also claims that souls may appear to others ""in order to seek our suffrages"" (i.e., souls in purgatory). Such apparitions can also be due to a special intervention into the human sphere by a demon creating a deception or an angel appearing in human form to communicate a message.
""Some people call these various apparitions ""ghosts."" In light of the tradition above, these can be either disembodied human souls or evil spirits. In Catholic thought, however, if such appearances happen, they are always limited and marked by truth, simplicity and utter clarity to distinguish a holy apparition from a demonic one, which is always marked by confusion, discord, chaos, fear and anxiety. Thus, there is no strictly theological basis for believing that there are souls ""wandering"" around in the world communicating with loved ones, or ""haunting"" places, but Catholics do believe that the deceased can appear after death in a strictly limited fashion and only with God's permission for some greater reason.
""What has been absolutely forbidden by the Church from the beginning is the attempt to conjure deceased souls from the grave or to communicate with the dead, a dark art known as necromancy. This prohibition is from Scripture. In the Christian tradition, we honor the dead and pray for them- we even consider ourselves in communion with them- but we do not conjure them up or attempt to dialogue with them. All such practices open us up to demonic deception and infestation.""
Rev. Euteneuer goes on to speculate as to whether or not a damned human soul could possess a living person in the same way that a demonic entity is able to do, and I will revisit this later.
I think we can condense his answer into a few key points.

Judgement after death is immediate.
God can allow, for various reasons, a deceased human soul to interact with living beings.
These scenarios should be considered irregular and rare.
We are not to seek out deceased souls with satanic magic.

It will be useful from here, I believe, to glance at Church teaching on the immediacy of judgement after death.

Catechism of the Catholic Church
1021-1022

1021 Death puts an end to human life as the time open to either accepting or rejecting the divine grace manifested in Christ. The New Testament speaks of judgment primarily in its aspect of the final encounter with Christ in his second coming, but also repeatedly affirms that each will be rewarded immediately after death in accordance with his works and faith. the parable of the poor man Lazarus and the words of Christ on the cross to the good thief, as well as other New Testament texts speak of a final destiny of the soul -a destiny which can be different for some and for others.
1022 Each man receives his eternal retribution in his immortal soul at the very moment of his death, in a particular judgment that refers his life to Christ: either entrance into the blessedness of heaven-through a purification or immediately,-or immediate and everlasting damnation.
 So we can conclude from these that if we living beings find ourselves interacting with a deceased human entity, this entity has already faced its judgement. Therefore it may be a damned soul, in which case it may seek to cause us grave harm, or it may be a saved soul. Of the souls of the saved, it may be undergoing purgation, in which case it is in need of our prayers, or it may be a member of the Church Triumphant, and therefore be able to intercede for us with the power of the saints.

We can conclude now that ghostly/paranormal activity is a possibility from a Catholic point of view, and it would be good to examine this activity in greater depth.


Hauntings

From my previous reading of anecdotal 'evidence' [read: ghost stories], I think we can safely divide paranormal activity into four main categories. These categories are:

Good entities
Evil entities
Poltergeists
Benign/neutral haunted houses
We will examine each in turn.

Good Entities:
I think we may conclude safely that these are the least problematic of any category of paranormal activity. These must be either souls in purgatory or in heaven, because a damned soul would be entirely unable to do good works. For a soul in purgatory, God may allow its temporary return in order to somehow right any damage it caused in its life. A soul undergoing purgation would also be especially inclined to ask for prayers. We can only speculate on particulars, and of course we must remember that it is not for us to understand the will of God. A hypothetical scenario which occurred to me is that of a father who became estranged from his son, and returned briefly after death to offer and receive healing and forgiveness. I recall Fr. Gabriele Amorth writing about a nun who was visited by a recently deceased member of the same order who begged for her prayers, and eventually her prayers led to the deceased nun's completion of purgation. However, I cannot find this story to reproduce it here in more detail, because I don't have the time to reread both his books.
A soul already experiencing the beatific vision may also be sent by God, in a similar manner to the angels, in order that it may intercede for us in some way. These actions would be directed somehow towards the benefits of we who are living, ultimately to inspire or strengthen our faith and resolve. We know that they have no need to complete any 'mission'. They cannot have 'unfinished business', because they have been perfected and are conformed to Christ. Maybe we can even consider the same father from our previous hypothetical who, having finished his purgation, returns to console his son during a crisis of faith later in life.

Evil Entities:
This category is also simple. We can quite safely say that if a deceased human entity intends harm for we who are living, then that soul must be damned. Souls in purgatory are unable to sin, and we need not even mention those in heaven. However, the souls of the damned live eternally in their sin; they know nothing but. Were a damned soul to temporarily visit the world of the living, we should conclude that it has been sent by Satan, but permitted by God, in the same way as demonic activity. We know also that these souls remain damned, as their judgement is final and eternal.
The extent of the influence of these damned souls may certainly be debated. It is, of course, exceedingly difficult for us, with our limited perspective, to distinguish between a damned human and a demon. This is simply because demons are wicked liars and would not hesitate to pose as a human if they perceived any benefit in doing so. Likewise it is reasonable that a damned soul might imitate a demon in hopes of intimidating a member of the living. Later in this post I will speculate further on this subject.

Poltergeists:
Poltergeist activity, along with so-called haunted houses are far more complex questions than simple good or evil entities. From stories we hear that poltergeists tend to be attached to a particular person, often an adolescent. These poltergeists tend to be mischievous, but mainly benign.
According to Fr. Herbert Thurston, SJ, (Ghosts and Poltergeists, page 2)
""A poltergeist is simply a racketing spirit, which in almost all cases remains invisible, but which manifests its presence by throwing things about, [...] in the course of which the human spectators are occasionally hit by flying objects, but as a rule suffer no serious injury.""
He says further that particular aspects of the poltergeist are,
""the invisibility of the agents, the sporadic and temporary nature of the manifestations, and notably their dependence upon the presence of some particular individual- usually a young person and often a child- who must be assumed to possess strange, if unconscious, mediumistic powers.""
Interestingly, Fr. Thurston seems to imply here that poltergeist activity is caused by ""mediumistic"" [psychic?] powers on the account of the central individual. Maybe in the case of poltergeists we are dealing with unconscious psychic powers of 'sensitive' individuals.

In fact, Fr. Amorth's treatment of the subject does not rule out this possibility. (An Exorcist, More Stories, page 160-161)
""Charismatics and Sensitives
""I mention both although we mistakenly tend to lump them together as one.

Charismatics have received a particular gift, or charism, from the Holy Spirit, which is to be used for the good of the entire Church, and not for their own personal benefit,
Sensitives, by nature, have higher levels of sensitivity (we often refer to a sixth sense) and are able to perceive things that cannot be detected by most individuals.""
Certainly, therefore, we must admit that some individuals have particular gifts or attributes which are especially inclined towards the paranormal. I recall Fr. Amorth writing elsewhere about poltergeist activity, but again, I'm unable to track it down at the moment. His treatment of the phenomenon was, as I recall, more or less identical to the quote above from Fr. Thurston.
On the subject of Poltergeists, I will let the conclusions of Fr. Thurston speak in my place.
""Although, as the reader will infer, I am myself quite satisfied of the reality of many of these poltergeist phenomena, notable in such a case as that of the Ketkar household at Poona, I have no thought of contesting the fact that nothing more purposeless- one might say, nothing more childish- could be imagined than these incomprehensible displays of some Puck-like spook bent on every exasperation form of mischief. In the words of Alice in Wonderland, ""he only does it to annoy, because he knows it teases."" Nevertheless, these phenomena seem to me to have their value as a proof of the existence of a world of spiritual agencies, not cognoscible directly by our sense perceptions. For the crude materialist such incidents must surely be very difficult to explain away. The stones have fallen, for they are solid and still to be seen; but who has thrown them? Crockery, chimney ornaments and glasses have been smashed, heavy pieces of furniture have been moved, pictures have jumped from the walls, but witnesses declare that they stood by and saw that no human hand came near them. Now it would be a very violent supposition to maintain that any human being is so psychically endowed that by taking thought he can make material objects external to himself fly about in eccentric paths, that he can move furniture, spirit away the contents of receptacles closed and locked, or set a curtain on fire by merely looking at it. What the nature of the agency is that performs these marvels we are not called upon to determine. Divines of all creeds in the seventeenth century were satisfied that such alarming phenomena could only be the work of the devil. I am not prepared to declare that they were wrong, though this solution cannot, I submit, be treated as a manner of certainty. But, be this as it may, we may reasonably call upon materialists who deny the possibility of miracles either to provide a physical explanation of these extraordinary poltergeist disturbances, or to submit some reasonable ground for rejecting the mass of evidence by which their reality has been established.
""It may be admitted in any case that nothing could be conceived more purposeless or irrational than the vagaries of the poltergeist. None the less, it seems impossible to reject the evidence which for so many centuries and in every country of the world attests the sporadic occurrence of such phenomena. To attribute them all to diabolic agency is difficult, if only because we credit the enemy of mankind with a higher level of intelligence than that which seems to prompt these outbreaks. Experience has shown that the exorcism and comminatory rites of the Church are not always, or indeed generally, effective in putting and end to poltergeist disturbances, though they sometimes produce a temporary mitigation. On the other hand, I have come across a few cases in which a special novena or the saying of Mass seems definitely to have got rid of the nuisance.""
I will submit then, tentatively yet in line with Fr. Thurston's thoughts on the matter, that poltergeist activity is indeed not otherworldly, at least not in a direct sense. In more unusual poltergeist cases which do not follow the common script, such as cases where prayers of exorcism are effective, where serious physical or spiritual harm occurs, or where evidence of witchcraft presents itself, it is rather easier to infer the presence of demonic activity. If we are to accept my conclusions, then we will reject these as being not true poltergeist activity, but rather a demon masquerading as a harmless, though annoying poltergeist.
What then would cause poltergeist activity? Referring back to Fr. Amorth I will suggest that, while a charismatic may have particular preternatural spiritual gifts, a young person afflicted with poltergeist activity has been chosen by God for spiritual trials. I will suggest that the charismatic and the focal point of a poltergeist both have particularly a keen and abnormal (yet likely unconscious) affinity for the spiritual world. While the charismatic may use this affinity for discernment, etc., the focal point of a poltergeist creates a sort of disturbance in the physical world due to his unconscious link to the spiritual world.
As for the reasons for this, we can only speculate. As Fr. Thurston mentions, poltergeist activity is mystifyingly purposeless. Maybe we can compare it to an infant not yet aware of his control over his own body, who thrashes and moves without really understanding how he does it. The mediumistic individual may have a poorly-understood access to the spiritual aspects of Creation, yet does not realize or understand how to control his particular form of control.
We recall also that poltergeist activity seems to be more common in young people. I am reminded of Jesus' call to ""let the little children come to Me"", and that we must be like children to attain salvation. Children are unique and somewhat anomalous in a very dark world. Maybe they are more open to these things that we do not understand.

Benign/Neutral 'Haunted Houses'
I finally have come to the last category of paranormal activity, and that is the phenomenon of the classic ""haunted house."" In my opinion this is the trickiest category, and one about which I still have no firm conclusions. We can conclude surely that some kind of haunting of buildings does exist. We know, of course, that inanimate objects may be infested by the demonic. This could be from curses, or from previous satanic activity, or (I think it is reasonable to assume) prolonged contact with someone severely afflicted by the demonic.
However, the demonic infestation of objects does not explain the 'classic' haunted house. These stories seem to have a few characteristics that are much more reminiscent of poltergeists than demons. Generally according to these stories, the house will remain 'haunted' over a long period of time. This seems to conflict with what we so far have believed of deceased human souls, namely that they are only allowed to return for brief periods. (See, for instance, Summa Theologica Supplementum, Q. 69 Article 3) We may answer this by remembering that God's time is not our time, so what seems to be a perpetually haunted house is still only a temporary state for the deceased soul.
More troubling with the cases of haunted houses is the apparent purposelessness, like that of poltergeists, which sheds more doubt on the whole subject. If God allows a soul to return to this world, we know it must be for some greater purpose. In the case of haunted houses, it appears more often than not that the entity does not interact with any living parties
I have heard two complementary explanations for the presence of haunted houses that I will share now. The first is that the classic haunted house is inhabited by the soul of a person in purgatory, and that their presence in the world of the living is to obtain our prayers for its salvation. By our awareness of its presence, we may be called to offer prayers for its purification.
The second explanation addresses the apparent purposelessness of hauntings, and that is that for some reason, these souls are unable to communicate in a direct manner with we who are living. We might speculate even, that some aspect of their purgation involves time on earth, mostly in isolation. I am considering for instance, a person who, though in a state of grace, was so attached to his house that he must be rid of this attachment to be free of the inclination to sin. Maybe his primary purpose on earth is to rid himself of this attachment, and secondarily, by our awareness of him we should pray that he is able to do so. This explanation also offers a clue as to why some hauntings are more subtle than others. This may conform to the level of attachment to that particular building on the part of the deceased.
Though I covered it elsewhere, I feel that I should say again that if a 'haunting' is violent or involves emotional, spiritual, psychological, or even physical harm, then it is almost certainly a demon masquerading as a soul in purgatory.
I will note finally that I consider many so-called haunted houses to be explainable by natural reasons. Some recent research has shown that certain frequencies which are below our ability to detect can cause sympathetic vibrations in the body that simulate feelings of dread, the feeling of being watched, or even the sensation of seeing something out of the corner of your eye. It is possible that some pipes vibrate at this particular range of frequencies, as well as old electronics, etc..

1317545452.0,18,self.Thetruthishere,ky8au,"Rain, woods, and darkness. [ME/FR]",bronsonbaker,23,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ky8au/rain_woods_and_darkness_mefr/,"  This is a story about a local legend. But, it's not a legend, meaning that only a few people know about it, and no one really KNOWS anything. I will present a few friends' encounters, then an encounter me and a friend had, and then my theories. 

 So the city we live in has a lot of woods. In fact, there are more woods than there are buildings. What I mean is the actual landscape is probably 60% woods. Now as we have a lot of woods, we have a lot of parks. The things that my friends have seen in these parks are what I believe to be true. My friends are some of the bravest guys I know and they can't even talk about it without crying. 
One group of my friends were in one of the parks at night cutting through the woods on the way to a party. It started raining so they decided that as late as it was, there were probably no cops going to check the parks while it was raining so that they should go under the pavilion and wait it out, or head home. As they started to make there way to the pavilion, they heard a snap. A fuckin' LOUD snap, as if someone had ripped a branch off of a tree. 

At this point everyone was a bit freaked out but just kept going anyway. Next they started to hear thumping and started running. Once they broke the wood line they heard a full blown crash and turned while running to see a dark creature, that looked like some sort of BIG fucking wolf that was a ""dirty blue-green"" running after them. One of my friends told me that he didn't know how long he had run because it seemed like time had started to slow down. He said he felt like that thing was just toying with them because he doesn't believe he could have ever outrun the creature, had it not wanted to be outrun. 

As I heard this story I thought of a kid I knew to be a ""weirdo"". I now know this kid was actually a Wiccan, but when I was younger I just thought he was weird. This was a kid who wore a trenchcoat and had a knife clearly displayed on his belt at all times he was legally allowed to do so. I decided to get his number through the grapevine and give him a call and asked him to meet up with me because I had to talk to him about some stuff. He was very suspicious at first as he wasn't a very close friend of MINE, but decided to meet me because he was friends with my friends. When we met (at the very park most of these stories took place in) he seemed like he was a bit scared, this worried me a bit. So I flat out asked him ""What do you know about Ryan, Josh and Paul's story?"" (fake names, I don't want my friends real names used.) At that point he said that if we were to talk about this, we had to leave the park as it was ""a trangression"". I didn't know what the fuck he was talking about but I followed him. We eventually made our way out of the park and he told me that they were ""corrupted guardians"" of the Native American tribes that used to live here way back in the day. The guardians, as he called them were once good but have become evil now. He said he didn't know why, or how,  but that I shouldn't really worry about it because beings like that don't normally meddle in human affairs. I asked him about our friends' story and how that happened, but he said that he didn't really believe them because he ""would have known"" had something really happened. 

I let it go and time went on. Somehow one winter night me and my friend Ryan got on the story talking in his kitchen one night. As he told me of his other experiences, he began to cry. I've NEVER seen him cry other than this one time. I was there when his Dad died, I saw when he broke his knee, I've never seen him cry from pain or loss, ever so I thought it odd and it made me believe him. I remember asking him if he would take me to the place where his first encounter he ever had was, and he agreed. He warned me to wear a pair of his boots, because he knew it was going to rain. I told him it wasn't gonna rain, if anything it was gonna snow. He just handed me some boots and I just went along with him. 

We got to the woods and I realized that these were woods where I'd had my own experiences. I remember that in these woods I found a dead cat as a child and once when I had thought about killing myself I came here. These woods were BAD. Creepy, someones died here bad. Now we walked into the woods and to the clearing in the center, and sure enough it started fucking raining. It was 15 degrees outside and it was raining. Not snow, sleet, icy rain, or hail. RAIN. This scared me a bit but we decided to push through and investigate. These woods were creepy because in the middle of this clearing there is a perfectly circular ring of trees, around a man-hole sewer grate, that are ALWAYS DEAD. Always have been. Dead in the summer ever since I was 7 years old, and at this point I was 17. That didn't surprise us though because we'd both known that it may have had something to do with the sewer system. We walked through the wooded hill near the clearing, around the top, and back down coming to stand in the middle of the circle of dead trees. After standing there we noticed that the two trees inside the circle make an arch. Then we heard twigs snapping. After a minute we heard branches breaking in THE EXACT PATH we had walked. At that point we were scared and had decided to leave the woods because no matter even if that was just a bum, we didn't wanna die out there. (There have been people killed in these parks) So we start on our way, then the weirdest thing that has ever happened to me, happened. As we were leaving I heard a voice. It sounded like it was IN my head. It said in the most difficult to describe voice you can imagine ""Onslah"". I asked my friend Ryan if he had heard anything and he asked me ""Onslah?"" 

At that point we ran. We just knew to get the fuck out of there. I was NOT playing around with that shit. As we ran, the rain picked up and the woods seemed to grow even darker. It seemed like forever until we got out of those woods, even though we were maybe five minutes in. Once we broke the line into the field the darkness seemed to lift and we ran until we got back to the street. Once we were there, the rain let up. We were nearly home before we noticed that it wasn't raining out here, it was snowing. We sat down and dried off, and started thinking about what happened. 
Whatever those things were, we believe that they were affiliated with rain, woods, and darkness. There are always all three of them around. Every time we even bring them up, it's either already raining and we don't notice, or it starts raining. One time during a summer drought when we went back there, it was soaked. Everything was wet as if it had just rained. I know there's a sewer line but it doesn't come up that high and the trees had rain on them. It's the strangest thing. 
I can't explain what those things are but if you guys want a few more experiences I will be willing to share with you. I have 2 more to tell you about. Thanks for reading, and you're more than welcome to do some research on these things. I presented all the things I know about them.

In my personal experience, a high percentage of 'hauntings' (or other paranormal experiences) take place in interstitial locations. That is, the boundaries between places: the shore (boundary between water and land); bridges and lighthouses (boundary between land and sky and water); doorways, elevators, and stairs (boundaries between rooms and floors). Not only are these places boundary lines, they are also caught between, neither one nor the other. 

Are hauntings more prevalent in these places because 'like calls to like' - spirits are neither alive nor dead, some say demons are alive but were never born, etc - or for some other reason?

     

     

Now, boundaries might be something else besides 'between places.' We (people, humans, etc) tend to categorize things, label things. We form patterns for things, we name things. This is important. It helps us feel secure, it allows us to communicate. 

Could boundary places create certain resonances in our brains that allow some sort of cross over? We know now that brains do have similar thought-patterns for things (see studies into reading 'thoughts' via brain scans). Maybe the way some of us categorize and recognize boundaries and interstitial zones allows us to start perceiving other things, things that we would normally overlook.

I never did any drugs or gambling or even alcohol. I lived on the shore, but never went to the beach much. I was more reserved than most. I had a few close friends from school and we hung out from time to time having tons of fun, and I was the youngest of the group.

When I turned 21, there was a small party that my friends threw for me over a good friend’s house close by mine (still on the shore). And yes, this was the first time I’ve ever drank any alcohol. I didn’t really like the taste of beer, so my good friend made me some rum and cokes. Without my knowledge, he was using 151 rum, which seemed like it was pure gasoline when we all took a shot of it. We eventually polished off the bottle and we all had a great time. I was feeling a little bit hot, so I went outside to cool off. Being close to the shore usually gives a nice breeze, so I headed for there.

While being completely intoxicated, I can only remember bits and pieces of what really happened. I get to the beach (a rather small beach, maybe only a quarter of a mile is classified as public), and I start walking up and down the beach. This is during the summer time, so the high benches where a life guard sits were out. And I can remember having the feeling that I could fly. So I decided to climb up one to jump off of. When I got to the top, I had realized someone was already sitting there starting at me.

She looked very beautiful and very attractive (although I was under the influence of alcohol, as my friends pointed out to me). She helped me up into the seat next to her. She was dressed in a weird clothing pattern, of darker colors that I can only remember as splotchy blacks, browns, and dark grays. We ended up talking for a while. What we talked about I can’t truly remember, but some things did stick out in my mind. Unfortunately, not her name.

We talked about how good, bad, and sad life could be and how the breeze felt so good on a night like this one. The moon was full and I couldn’t help but ask her if she was seeing anyone. She had said “not anymore”, which I was excited about. I quickly switched topics to something I can only remember saying the words “fun in the sun”, which I have no idea what I was spouting out. All I could really focus on was ‘not anymore’. Towards the end of our conversation I asked where she lived. I truly believe that she said “At the end of Cove Street” (a dead end road on the shore close to where I live). I somehow smooth talked her and leaned in for a kiss.

At this point, I blacked out. My friends eventually came looking for me and found me passed out on the lifeguard chair because my foot was dangling from it. Apparently I gave them quite the scare as they thought I was dead. They woke me up and I incoherently wobbled my way back home. When I woke up my friends told me their story and I told them mine. The only thing my friend said which stuck out was that I was “unusually warm”. I was out on the beach for over an hour with a constant cold breeze while being drunk (which doesn’t help your circulatory system). They of course didn’t believe me, and we all took a little trip over to Cove Street so I can find this girl again. There were a few houses closer to the main road, but only 1 house was at the end of it. The house was in pieces. Burn marks were all over the walls and the grass was very overgrown. My friend said that maybe I was dreaming it, in that they found me passed out. But it was just so vivid, so real. It wasn't a dream to me.

1311352557.0,20,self.Thetruthishere,iwxhn,"Late Night Hiking Trip [Very long, sorry.]",kaltivel,23,3,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/iwxhn/late_night_hiking_trip_very_long_sorry/,"Let's start this off with a little...background, I suppose? Near my house, there's a massive 2,000+ acre area that once was home to a military production plant for TNT.  It's now home to a car manufacturing plant and a nature reserve. Most of this 2,000 acre area is dense forest and winding through the forest, there are several dirt trails. There's also an old, overgrown cemetery hidden in the forest. Some of its graves hold babies and a few are unmarked. (Possibly the graves of slaves, which wouldn't surprise me as I live in the southern USA and the cemetery could easily be over 200 years old) Well, it was maybe a month after graduating from high school and three of my friends were spending the night at my place. We decided it would be a good idea to take a midnight hike into the forest on these trails and I had hiked on these trails before during the day time. We didn't know what was apparently waiting for us.


It was around 9 PM, I suppose and we started getting ready for our hiking adventure. I took my backpack from high school and gladly emptied out my remaining notes and paper-back workbooks and filled it with snacks, quite a few water bottles, a machete (you never know when you'll need one in the woods) and a few flashlights. In addition to the flashlights, I was carrying a massive spotlight that I had bought specifically for exploring in the woods at night. It was just my friends James, Dustin, Richard and myself. We were all geared up and so we set out on our adventure. To get to the trails, you have to walk through maybe a mile of neighborhood roads. We were all 18 at the time, so legal curfew was no concern to us. However, having a machete in my backpack made me understandly nervous about possibly getting caught. We finally reached the trails after a 20 minute walk through the neighborhoods, all the while we were chatting about girls, games, typical stuff.


It only took about 15 or 20 minutes on the trails for us to run into whatever was waiting there. Our destination was originally the cemetery, which is maybe an hour's hike into the woods, so we didn't get far at all. We were casually hiking when we came to a hill. My friend Richard stops and says he needs to rest, saying he feels like his energy was drained. (He's not a very physicaly fit guy, so we understood.) I handed him a snack and a water bottle and we just relaxed at the bottom of the large hill for 5 minutes. Suddenly my friend Dustin says he saw something at the top of the hill, almost like somebody hiding in the bushes that are up there. He and James decided to go check it out, taking the spotlight and the machete with them. I volunteered to stay behind with Richard. After 5 minutes of them investigating, they came tearing down the hill screaming about something. 


I nervously asked them what the hell was going on and they replied ""There was something in the bushes, but when we got up there it had already moved away."" The way they described it was a pitch-black shadow with a single, golden ""eye"" that remained in the shadows or bushes, never coming out. They also said that if they tried to get near it, it would almost teleport into a further away shadow or bush.


The look on their faces told me that it was no joke so we got the hell out of there and rushed our way toward the neighborhood, all the while this thing is following us. However, the way it would follow us and move away if we got closer was almost as if it was asking us to follow it. Maybe it needed help, who knows? We were too scared to find out what it wanted.


We finally made it back to the neighborhood and were nearly running home....the thing is still following us. Out of no where, I'm hit with emotions that I could only desribe as an extreme sorrow and felt tears forming in my eyes. I blinked them away and notified my friends of the feelings that overcame me.


We were about half way home when James and Dustin say ""There's two of them. We just saw one in front of us."" This scared me even more, so we began walking faster and faster. We were just about to pass the deck of one of the houses when James stops in his tracks, a terrified mask where his face used to be. He says ""Something black just flashed in front of my face for a second or two and completely blocked everything out.""


We continued, going faster and faster. The two entities seemed to stop following us as we were about 3/4 there. What followed us then was a massive, black, ominous ""mist"" of some sort that seemed to always be behind us, blocking any light behind it. We stopped, held hands, and said a quick prayer. The black mist seemed to weaken a little, eventually disappearing as we passed a church that's right up the road from my house.


The two black figures scared me, but I didn't feel threatened by them. The black mist, however, made me feel as if I were its prey.




A few months later, it was just Dustin and me. We decided to go hiking, during the day of course. Everything was completely normal, for the majority of the time. When we took a rest break about half-way to the cemetery, Dustin put his hat down on the ground, top-up. We continued on, but he forgot about his hat. We were finally returning from the cemetery when I realized he had forgotten his hat and that it wasn't where he left it. We just continued on because he said he could get another. Half-way between where we rested this time and where Dustin and James originally saw the black figure, we found his hat. In the middle of the trail, updside down. The hat wasn't crumpled like someone had dropped it, it was almost as if someone picked it up, turned it upside down, and gently placed it on the ground.",,False,,t5_2sntx,True,,,True,t3_iwxhn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/iwxhn/late_night_hiking_trip_very_long_sorry/,
1375600241.0,17,self.Thetruthishere,1jo5g1,[FR/ME] Prequel to my rehab experience,bassrose,20,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1jo5g1/frme_prequel_to_my_rehab_experience/,"A few people asked on my [original post](http://redd.it/1jmvbb) to share what else I knew about the building, so here goes nothing. 

Let me just start off by going into more detail on the building itself. As I mentioned in my first post, it had previously been a hospital, a retirement home, and a different rehab. I've tried to research plenty into the documented history of the building but had no luck. 

What I have gathered from different people, was that this hospital had practiced lobotomies. To me at least this isn't too far of a stretch considering it was an acceptable practice at the time this hospital was around. The area that these supposed lobotomies took place was shut down, and no one was allowed inside, except for maintenance guys. I spook to a few guys that had been in there, and all of them told me they believed it was haunted. I think the reason the unit I was in had so much activity, was because had been the emergency room when the building was the hospital.  

Now on to the spooky stuff. Most of this comes from a guy, Evan who was in the rehab at the time this took place. This has also been confirmed by a girl from my last story (Rachel) who became one of my closest friends, because she knows several people who were there at the time. My counselor and several RA's have confirmed the story as well. 

Evan was a very religious guy who strongly believed in spirits, ghosts, whatever you want to call them. The same things I shared in my experience happened to these people in the unit was well. Evan had an uncle that worked for the rehab and got access to documents and information most people (including myself) couldn't. He and a few other boys decided to try to contact the spirits using a Ouija board. He explained that through multiple sessions with the board, they learned that basically, there was spirits all throughout the building. No surprise there. He discovered there were 3 main spirits that lingered in our particular unit while the rest seemed to stay in the closed down area or the church. 2 out of the 3 spirits were evil. The other one was just harmless and tended to linger in the boy's group room while the other 2 jumped around. I can confirm this completely aligns with my personal experiences. I know I saw with complete certainty one of the malevolent spirits (as detailed in first post). Evan also claims to have at one point communicated with the doctor (who stayed in the closed off area) who performed the lobotomies. He told me this man was the source of evil in that building, and multiple people he had operated on (and died, as a result) remained in the building.

Having the upbringing he did, Evan began carrying around a bible at all times, reading verses and trying to tell the spirits they had to leave whenever things began to happen. This made the spirits very angry, leading to this one night.

It started when Evan's roommate (Justin) was in the shower. When Justin got out, he could see someone had drawn a demon's head (again, see my first post) on the mirror in the steam. This wasn't the first time this had happened to them and he got extremely angry/scared. Justin instantly barged into the group room and accused his Evan and their other roommate of playing a joke on him. Neither of them had been in the room and denied it completely. (The bathroom doors are EXTREMELY heavy and there's no way they could've gotten in and out without making a sound. The shower curtains are pretty much see through and don't stretch to the end of the shower, meaning he would've easily saw them even if they managed to get in silently).

The three of them went back to their bedroom, and their room had been destroyed. The mattresses had been flipped over, all the drawers had been pulled out of the dresser and thrown around the room, the clothes had been ripped out of the closet, and trash had been strewn everywhere. The creepiest thing was that Evan had shaved about 3 days before that, and that trash had already been taken out- his hair was among the trash in that room. Instantly Evan took out his bible and began to pray. Justin tried to read from the bible, but every time he touched the bible his nose began to bleed profusely. It stopped whenever he took his hands off the bible but would start again when he tried to read from the bible or pray. 

One RA who I'll call Carrie, who was very religious, went around the entire unit and blessed every room, demanding whatever was there to leave. She knew there was something evil there. She fired for that just a day or two after it happened.

I got very close to my counselor while I was there and she confided in me this had actually happened.  She told me the official story was that Justin had drawn the face in the mirror himself and one of the boys must've destroyed the room (they never could explain that one away) and that Justin had cut *a slit in his own nose* (keep in mind, in a place that allowed absolutely nothing sharp) and would make it bleed *just* when he read the bible or prayed. Justin was sent to a mental hospital the next day, and they kicked Evan out soon after that. 

Other RA's working that night knew what actually happened as well as the people that experienced it. The counselors were told after this happened they were not allowed to tell patients that the unit was haunted or that the paranormal had anything to do with that night. My counselor easily could've been fired for what she told me. They also banned Ouija boards.

So that's what I know about the rehab. I wish there was some way I could provide proof but given the setting I can't think of a way. If anyone has any ideas please let me know. I'll try digging around again for more information on this building.

I'm glad that I found this subreddit. I thought maybe someone can provide explanations for my experiences throughout my life.

Ever since I was a child, I experienced sleep paralysis and ""hallucinations"". Sometimes I would have very intense episodes and not so intense episodes. The most memorable sleep paralysis episode that I had was when I was in middle school. One night, I couldn't sleep because I was scared of nuclear bombs or whatever so I stayed up until 2 or 3am(  weird stuff always happens to me around this time). I finally got into bed and laid there. As soon as I caught myself drifting off to sleep, I immediately became paralyzed. I saw a tall dark figure at my door and I could feel it staring at me...of course I panicked. I closed my eyes and tried to calm down. I believe I went to sleep because when I opened my eyes again I was out of my body flying around the apartment. I flew into the living room because someone was at the door. I opened the door and a blonde haired feral looking boy ran in under me while an alien ran into the apartment going towards the tv. Me and the alien were flyflighting around the living room. I couldn't leave the place I was in, so I decided to kill myself by flying into the tv electrocuting myself. When I woke up, I was really sweaty. 

I'm noticing trends in my sleep paralysis episodes.... Flying, aliens, dark ominous figures at my door or at the foot of my bed and now voices. 

Now for the meditation...I started doing meditation a couple of weeks ago because of its benefits. First time I tried meditation, I listened to a tape. Second time, I did it on my own. When I was ""losing"" myself in meditation, I heard a voice or felt the energy of  a woman....I can't really describe it. I heard/felt them say ""Wake up, AzulRio."" I was so startled it knocked me out of my meditation and I haven't done it since.

I apologize for the long wall of text. I just really wanted to get everything out in this post although I have more experiences I want to share with you all. I'll just post them later.

I posted something on /r/paranormal before I found this subreddit and I think my first post is in the wrong place. This is the link for my previous post: http://redd.it/1izck8. I was really glad to find this subreddit. 

Any who, I have had a lot of unexplainable experiences. This is just a short account of some of the things that have happened in my parent’s house.  I’m just going to focus on one bedroom for this post.

I have two older brothers, my brother Richard is 7 years older than me and Alan is 5.5 yeas older than me. When Richard moved out I moved into his room which, in my opinion, was a mistake. I chose to go to his room because it was much bigger than mine. In this room I always felt like I couldn’t place my feet on the floor by my bed; I had to jump on or off the bed rather than just placing my feet. Years later when all of us were at my other brother Alan’s house the subject of our parent’s house and the creepy stuff that happened came up. Richard told us that he had a problem with placing his feet by the bed in his old room. This really creeped me out. 

I had a hutch were I kept my trophies and pom poms at the very top. One day I heard a knock and I was dumb enough to knock back, there were maybe four knocks exchanged when I asked “who’s there,” the hutch started violently shaking, nothing fell which was odd, it suddenly stopped. I was home alone and the wall of this room connects to a second staircase that has vaulted ceilings. The knocks were coming from a place unreachable without the help of a latter. 

During one of my sleep overs in high school the speakers to my computer picked up very loud static even though the computer and the speakers were unplugged and not hooked up. My friend ended up not staying the night.

When I was home from college during winter break I was up late reading a magazine when I heard what I thought were my parents talking (it sounded like a man and a woman). It was around 2 am and thought it was weird so I went down the hall to ask if they were awake. I asked three times, getting progressively louder, and I got nothing but snores in response. When I was in the hallway it stopped but when I got back into my room and was in there for a few minutes it began again. I went down the hall again, then down stairs, and went so far as to open the front door. Nothing.

During my summer between junior and senior year of college when I would wake up and go down stairs I would see people standing in the back yard. This happened every day for about a month and the number of people also seemed to increase as the days went on.  I would only see them for a few moments and then they would be gone. I haven’t had this happen before or since.

When I was home from college one weekend my boyfriend at the time called me ten minutes before my alarm was going to go off and I decided to lie in bed until it did. The phone I had at the time was an LG Chocolate, you had to push up part of it to get to the keys. I was fully awake because I had just gotten off the phone and placed it right next to my pillow when I heard the keys on the phone being depressed like someone was dialing or texting. I got up immediately after and moved into a different bedroom the next day.

I’d really like to see what other people think.

1374643548.0,19,self.Thetruthishere,1ixszv,Something Followed My Friend From Bachelor's Grove Cemetery in Chicago [FR],wontonsoup771,22,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1ixszv/something_followed_my_friend_from_bachelors_grove/,"Hey, so this is my first time posting on this subreddit, and I'm pretty excited to share this story. I hope you guys enjoy it.

As the title suggests, this happened to a childhood friend of mine, and he's sworn that it's completely true.

So, this past Saturday, my friend D and I were hanging out throughout the whole day lifting weights and sparring in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. After a physically exhausting day, we grabbed some burritos and headed over to his house to watch some horror films, which were quite cheesy if I might add. By the time the last film ended, we decided to call it a night, and D drove me to my house to drop me off. 

As we were talking in the car, D abruptly shifted the conversation to his paranormal experiences. Apparently, last summer (approximately a year ago), he was really into going to haunted places around the Chicagoland area and trying to see if he could experience anything paranormal. He mentioned places like the O'hare airport landing strip where the AA 191 crash occurred and the Resurrection cemetery on the south side of the city.

Amidst all of his stories, he decided to tell me his most interesting experience at the Bachelor's Grove cemetery, which is considered by many as the most haunted cemetery in the world. In this particular experience, D, his cousin M, and his friend T went to the cemetery. If you guys are not familiar with the topography of the area, the cemetery is located deep within a forest preserve. D and his company parked on the outer most area of the forest preserve around 3 AM and began to walk a few miles through the woods with a pair of flashlights in order to reach the cemetery right int he middle of the preserve. From D's account, the walk there was uneventful, but they felt as if they were being followed, and as a result, they kept looking back only to find just darkness staring right back at them. This uneasiness quickened the pace of the group, and they finally reached the cemetery after half an hour.

Once at the cemetery, the guys roamed around carefully inspecting the vandalized tombstones and grave markers around the area. M and T were tense and a bit creeped out from the walk, but they managed to talk to each other for quite a bit in order to calm their nerves. However, D suddenly heard whispers near the forest and told everyone to shut up. Everyone went to a crouch and began to listen. There were indeed whispers nearby, but none of the guys couldn't pinpoint where it was coming from. After a few minutes, the silence was broken by a yelp from D, and D immediately started running towards the cemetery entrance. M and T eventually caught up with D, and they managed to ask what happened. Apparently D was grabbed by the wrist by some unforeseen entity, and as a result, the group decided to go back to see if they can experience the same thing again. By the time they could go back to the place where they heard the whispers, they heard a clear voice of a woman screaming from the cemetery pond nearby. All three of the guys lost it and ran back to the car, but they managed to stop past the entrance of the cemetery to make sure they didn't run aimlessly through the woods and get lost. By this time, it was raining heavily with thunder, and it seemed straight out of a horror film. The guys decided to head back to the car at a jogging pace. About half-way back to the car. They saw two silhouettes with lights in front the trail about 100 yards away from them. Thinking that they were cops, the guys immediately ran off the trail and hid in a nearby bush. However, they quickly realized that the silhouettes did not belong to cops because the lights were dimming and intensifying at an unrecognizable pattern. Moreover, the lights seemed to hover over the ground without having the bouncing effect that you would see from a person walking with a flashlight. Scared shitless, D and the others remained frozen until the lights disappeared. At this point, the guys made a mad dash for the car, and they fortunately made it, but D swore that he saw the lights following them when he looked back over his shoulder. With their nerves at an intense level, the three of them booked it in their car.

You guys would think that this would be the end of that experience, but it doesn't end there. 

For a full week after the experience, D felt as if some entity followed him home from the cemetery. When he was home by himself (he was home alone a lot because his mother works late quite frequently), he would get sense of being watched, and he would constantly hear distinct shuffle of footsteps over the carpeted floor when no one else was in the house. In addition, things would get moved or just disappear completely. In one instance, he laid a pull-up bar leaning on the corner of the room all by itself and right after he let go of it, the bar fell in the opposite direction from where it was leaning! All these paranormal things aren't limited to times when he was awake. When he would be about to sleep on his bed, he would see this distinctly outlined black/grey haze/fog in one of the top corners of his bedroom. D would try ignore it and pull the covers over his head hoping it would go away, but it would never disappear. This happened starting at the middle of the week, and he let this go on for about two nights until he moved his bed so that he wouldn't have to face the particular corner where the fog inhabited. By the end of the week, D had enough and decided to deal with this issue. I don't know where he got this idea, but he burned everything that he wore and had on the night he visited Bachelor's Grove (basically anything associated with the experience). Apparently, he thought by removing anything associated that night, whatever that followed him home wouldn't be able to do so. Surprisingly, it worked, but as he was burning the clothes and items, he heard a distinct demonic voice shrieking as if it were in pain. D's older sister was there when he burned the things, and she also confirmed that she heard the shriek. Right after burning the items, D immediately felt a sense of relief as if a burden was lifted from his shoulders.

I called my girlfriend and began walking across the school field opposite my grandmas house. We talked for about a minute or so and than suddenly her voice begins to cut out. What I heard next was the strangest sounds I've heard in my life. It sounded like a person breathing inward but talking fluently the whole time. A fairly deep voice too, not speaking any language I have ever heard. This goes on for at least another minute with me just listening and calling her name, asking if she's there. The weird thing is everytime I'd call her name or ask if she was there the voice would stop and let me talk, and then start talking again. After the minute or so of listening to it the call cuts out and I wait for a bit. She calls back and I say what the hell was that? She tells me that she heard it on her side too and that it sounded very alien, which it did. At this point my heart was racing and my hair was standing up, it seriously freaked me out. I don't have a clue in the world what it could have been, and she brushed it off as the signal messing up. It just weirds me out that when I would talk it would stop and seem to listen to me before beginning to talk again. This isn't the first experience I've had with witnessing something unknown, but this is the first time I've actually heard something I can't explain.. interesting.

1374216069.0,16,self.Thetruthishere,1im8c0,Unknown Occurrences in Little Falls,LadyPo,20,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1im8c0/unknown_occurrences_in_little_falls/,"For the past two years, my best friend (let's call her Kate) and I have spent a week at her nana's house for a summer visit. (For random info purposes, the first time I went with, we were both 16.) Her nana owns what used to be used as a community church, built in 1902 by Swedish immigrants. The main chapel is joined to a slightly more modern building (from the 60s) that held offices and such, but now is used for living areas. It's really cool to visit.

It's also really creepy.

Kate had told me stories about how it's supposedly ""haunted"" and how her nana hears weird things and the electricity gets weird... her printer turns on randomly, lights go out, the radio turns on without warning, etc. The latter could be due to the building's age, but they had an electrician check it out a while back and said everything seems to be fine. I have always gone back and forth about whether supernatural things could be real, so it seemed interesting to me. Kate and I are both into that stuff and we made plans to hang out in the chapel area (the creepiest place) late at night while we worked on making these tie blankets. 

**FIRST YEAR**

During the day, the chapel was peaceful and pretty... the stained glass windows were typical of an old church and it was mostly natural, although it was unsettling to be in. You can hear a bit of daytime traffic from inside, but since Little Falls is a tiny town, there are hardly any cars outside the church at night. When I entered the chapel at night for the first time, it was creepy. It felt like we were constantly walking through spiderwebs and our legs and arms kind of tingled. We were listening to the radio quietly and making the blankets on the floor when suddenly, we heard five or six crystal clear footsteps coming from the front of the chapel (where there is a stage... the floor inside is all wooden). From the initial hollow thump of the heel to the soft noise of the toes coming down, they were exceedingly realistic. We both looked at each other with completely startled faces. We heard them over the music and it sounded like a man walking across the stage, even though there wasn't anyone there and the entire room is filled with old stuff like furniture that her nana is trying to sell. Kate asked me, ""did you hear that?!"" I replied with a yes and we immediately started trying to figure out what it was. We went over to the newer area and found her nana watching tv just as she had been for the past few hours. She had both of her small dogs inside with her and she told us she had been there the whole time. She said that no one else was here.

Kate and I talked about it a lot since... the only other weird thing I remember happening was the power completely turning off for about half an hour, but I think it was because we blew a fuse somehow. 

**SECOND YEAR**

The first year was a lot of fun (we did other things than ""ghost hunting"") so we planned to go again. We highly doubted that we would hear or see anything and what we had experienced was a once-in-a-lifetime event. We considered the footsteps to be some sort of residual auditory phenomena. 

However, the next time we went back, it seemed like things got worse. It was as if the more time we spent there, the more intense the paranormal things became. We went out in the chapel at about nine thirty, just to see if anything else would happen. We were talking to ""ghosts"" and laughing at ourselves because we felt silly trying to pretend to be the people from Ghost Adventures. When the time passed and it was shortly after 10:00, the entire place had a darker vibe. Even the light seemed dimmer and the tingly spiderweb feeling was more bothersome. We heard two knocks near the back of the church. The exterior is made of brick and the whole yard is fenced in so it wasn't someone on the outside. The knocks sounded like they were on wood... we looked to the back corner to see wooden boards leaning against the wall. We decided to go to bed for the night after getting too scared. We were just a pair of two frightened 17 year old girls, after all.

We shared a king bed sized mattress on the floor of her guest room (she's eclectic and owns a church as a home... she's kind of awesomely crazy and doesn't have proper furniture, but there was nothing wrong with the mattress on the floor to us). We each had our suitcases next to us. Kate and I were falling asleep after trying to laugh off what we heard just feet away from us. We were both about to drift off when out of nowhere, we hear scratching. On canvas. It went one direction, the other direction, back, and back once more. Four swipes. (I'm providing so much detail because I can remember it so vividly and I want to make it seem like you were with my friend and I.) Kate said nervously, ""what was that...?"" and I responded ""I don't know"" and started to panic. For whatever reason, we both fell asleep right away and I don't remember panicking for an entire minute after speaking before sleeping. The next morning, Kate tried mimicking the sound we both heard on her suitcase and it was identical. The room is made of bricks and the door was closed... there were no animals or other people inside.

We spent the day outside walking around and sitting in the sun... we put sunscreen on our chest and face, but not the rest of our body so we expected to be burned later because we were too lazy to put it on our legs and such.

Two or three nights later, we were in the same situation. Falling asleep when I heard the tin of mints inside my purse next to me shake. Kate woke up to it and I felt more frightened than I had been before. My purse was resting on my suitcase for hours (so it wasn't just adjusting) and the shaking was more like someone tilted it so the mints slid to one direction and then they slid back the other way. I couldn't sleep the rest of the night and my mind kept playing tricks on me. I was seeing things.. shadows and lights, but I credit that nearly fully to my sleepy state and wild, terrified imagination. We decided to leave the next morning.

When I woke up, I was burned as expected everywhere on my body except for one place. On my left leg was a white handprint... with long, pointy fingers.

I have a picture of it, but I am relatively new to reddit and I don't know how to upload a picture... do I put in online and then link a URL? Please help me share this with you, redditors!

The reason why I'm sharing this story now is because Kate and I are going for another week long visit...
....on Monday. x_x

I think my ancestry is why I seem to have been enveloped with the spiritual world long before my earliest memories.

My parents and family/friends who would watch me while I was still in a crib swear to this day that they would see a ""dark feeling"" presence hovering over me - they have home videos of me throwing out of this world tantrums whenever it was time for me to go to my room for a nap or sleep - when I was one my heart stopped and I had to be rushed to the ER,  my god-father and his oldest son swear that the only reason they realized I was in danger was because of  a ""growl"" coming from my room, they swear up and down that when they ran in instead of seeing an animal(we lived in the country at the time), there was a dark figure leaning over touching me. They are convinced that the reason I stopped breathing was because that entity was choking or somehow harming me. Being as I was too young to vouch for my family and friends at the time, I can only say that from the videos, and never-changing stories I have heard over the years that there is some truth to them. (Pertaining to my heart stopping the doctors attributed it to asthma or an allergic reaction that restricted my ability to receive oxygen.”

My own testimonies of my experiences with the spiritual world began when I was four. My grandfather was and still is my favorite person. My parents and I lived across the country from him when he passed away, I was playing in my playroom when I felt, warm - like when you're laying in the grass and the sun overtakes the clouds and bathes you in it's light and warmth all of a sudden – I have no idea why my four year old mind automatically assumed that it was perfectly rational that my grandfather was in the room with me based off of that feeling, but I yelled out in happiness to “feel/see” him with me. When my mother came to see why what all my noise was about I told her that grandaddy had come to see me, nobody ever thought it was odd or coincidence that I somehow communicated with him even though he had passed, before they even knew. For most of my childhood I would find myself fully embracing his presence and talking animatedly with him, I scared my family hundreds of times from bursting out laughing at something funny he would do or say.  
I've never doubted that this presence is my grandfather, and I still feel him visiting me every now and then though not as strong as when I was a child, nor do I act so jubilantly, I smile and exchange “I love you's” and hugs, there is no denying for me that he and the feelings of pure beauty and peace he touches me with are real. 

Along with being able to sense certain “spiritual essences” as a child I had the ability to realize things most people couldn't. I would have dreams that somehow I knew to be messages, being so young I didn't comprehend how I was different or more in touch with things. One time I dreamed that my mother was pregnant with a boy, he was adorable, but he had to go to a different home so I wouldn't meet him but that was okay. The next morning I told my mother that my baby brother said for us not to be sad, she broke down in tears of shock because she had miscarried him and wasn't planning on telling anyone besides my father she was even pregnant to begin with. // Othertimes I would just have simple dreams about someone calling or coming to visit, or a specific place we would end up passing by. As I've gotten older I've become out of touch with that particular sensitivity, every once in a blue moon I'll have ultrabright-clear dreams about someone being sad for some reason and just know somethings going come up with them, but I never act on it. I've grown up to think on some level it's something to put off to coincidence. 

Being able to acknowledge presences near me has stayed with me though. I've always had times where I would swear on my life there was something else in a place with me. When we moved to my second home my parents  gave me the master bedroom, but once I set foot in it I felt what I now realize was pure dread and cold chills. I demanded a different bedroom and would throw a fit when they left the door to the master room open. My parents wouldn't even sleep in it because I think my fear subconsciously affected them. Even in my early teens that bedroom gave me that feeling of dread, it always felt like some malevolent force was suffocating me. One night I kept hearing heavy breathing and a mans voice muffled from it, I yelled for my parents who both heard thumps coming from it, there was nobody  nor animals in the room when they looked. Just random things like that always happen to me. 

I'm convinced it's because I'm from a a family that prides itself on being in touch with their surroundings, that I'm encased in these experiences. I know it's nothing intense like some people who see full bodied apparitions or “demons” or the like, but it's still always interested me that I've ever been able to feel or see anything out of the “norm”.  
I'm sorry this is so long, I've never found a site like this so I was excited to post some of my experiences with the “abnormal”.

1372311038.0,19,self.Thetruthishere,1h5txx,[ME]A Cabin in the Woods,Blacklightzero,31,12,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1h5txx/mea_cabin_in_the_woods/,"In December of 2002, one of my best friends, R, was getting married.  I had moved off the peninsula a couple of years before and had never met her, but apparently they had been together for a while.  Against my advice, he had joined the Marines and was marrying his girl before he shipped off to Iraq for his first tour.  

My other two best friends, K and W, came back to our old hometown of Port Angeles for the wedding as well.  We had a good time the night before the wedding and woke up early to make the 50 mile drive to Forks for the ceremony at the court house.  

Things started out bad as a tire on my car blew out early on the way there and we were forced to make the rest of the trip on my spare driving under 20 mph.  We were almost late, but we made it and they had a nice little ceremony before we went to the bride's grandmother's house for the reception.

The festivities didn't end until well after dark.  The drive back to Port Angeles was too risky to make with a spare tire.  It was overcast, foggyand pitch black. There were no street lamps on the highway between Forks and PA. My car was small and black and we had almost been hit by speeding cars in the daytime. I wasn't going to be able to get back to PA until I had a new tire but there was nowhere left in Forks open to buy one at that time of night.  We were going to have to find somewhere to bed down until the morning.

The bride asked if we could crash at her grandma's, but her grandma said she was afraid that we would rape her.  Obviously she was out of her mind.  It was way too cold to sleep in my car.  I had spent too much money on the party the night before, being the best man and all, and we couldn't get together money for a room.  

The bride suggested her other grandma's cabin. Her other grandmother had passed away a few months ago and the cabin she lived in out towards La Push was vacant. My friend K inexplicably said ""No way.  I'm going to take the last bus back to PA.  I'll see you tomorrow."" And walked out the door without another word.  That should have been a big clue to me that something was wrong, but I was stuck because I wasn't going to abandon my car.

I grabbed my things out of my car and R and his new wife drove us out to her dead grandma's cabin about 15 minutes outside of town.  It was called a cabin because it was in the middle of nowhere, but it was really just a small two story house.  There was a lamp in the driveway but other than that everything was pitch black out.  R and his bride let W and I inside and had a look around with us.  Most of the furniture had already been removed by her family.  There was a card table and a couple of metal chairs in the kitchen and a wardrobe still in the only bedroom.  The wardrobe was completely empty however.  It's contents were in a pile in the middle of the room and formed a man-sized nest.  ""My uncle uses this place as a hunting lodge sometimes.  He's a bit crazy.  He hasn't gotten over grandma's death."" she volunteered.  ""If he finds you here, he'll be really mad so you should probably hide if you hear him.  But he leaves lots of Pepsi and beer in the fridge so you can help yourself if you like.""

W and I felt exactly as you'd imagine we did, but at this point it was either stay here in a cabin with heat or try to sleep outside where it's below freezing.  

R and his wife went to go have their wedding night while W and I tried to figure out exactly where we were going to hide if said crazy uncle did come around.  There was a set of retractable stairs going up to the attic where we found a couple of dusty, stained single mattresses covered with old hand-made quilts and the husks of thousands of dead insects.  We decided it was best to retract the stairs and hide out in the attic for the night.  Apparently the crazy uncle preferred to sleep in a pile of his dead mother's clothes.  The kitchen was devoid of knives, but I found a wood splitting maul on the back porch.  We kept it upstairs with us just in case.  

In my backpack I still had a couple malt liquors left over from the night before.  Without TV or radio or any other form of entertainment, W and I sat on the mattresses drinking Mad Dog 20/20 and talking about old times and all the trouble that R had gotten himself into this time.

Without any clocks available we lost track of time and had a decent buzz going. What we heard sobered us up quickly.  We heard a noise that sounded like the doorknob downstairs being shaken violently.  With wide eyes, we looked at each other and listened carefully.  The noise occurred a couple more times.  I slowly moved to the window and tried to quickly peek out and see if there was a car in the lamp-lit driveway.  Nothing.  We sat silently for a while and heard nothing.

We began to talk again, but once again were interrupted by what sounded like the refrigerator slamming shut and chairs being moved around the floor.  There were no voices.  I grabbed the maul and waited at the top of the still retracted stairs.  As suddenly as the noise started it stopped and we waited in silence but heard nothing.  We were freaked out.  We couldn't go to sleep but we got bored and began talking again in a whisper.

Without a clock or watch I don't know how long after we heard the chairs move it was when the phone began to ring.  We waited for the phone to stop ringing (or somebody downstairs to answer it) but it just kept ringing.  It kept ringing beyond what any normal person would wait for an answer.  I figured the crazy uncle, if he was there, would have picked it up long ago, so we were probably alone.  The only people who knew we were here were R and his wife.  With the number of rings I assumed it was an emergency.  I lowered the stairs and took the maul with me just in case.  
I braced for an attack but none came.  Nobody was waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs and I could see that the kitchen was clear. I walked over to the still ringing phone and picked it up.  The ringing stopped but there was no dial-tone.  The phone was dead.  I picked up the phone and looked at it.  It wasn't plugged into the wall.  It was an old rotary phone with a mechanical bell that looked like it had been made back in the 60's.  It sat there silent.

I used the bathroom and went back upstairs and told W about the phone.  He said I was messing with him, but I assured him I wasn't and told him to go look for himself.  W was pretty freaked out. He needed to take a leak but was too afraid to go downstairs.  Instead he peed out of the second floor window into the cold night air.  The window stuck open and it was freezing.  I was freaked out and mad.  

The phone started to ring again.  We sat and counted the rings.  I remember counting as high as 170 when I decided it was useless.  I wasn't going back downstairs to answer an unplugged phone.  I laid down on the mattress, listening to the phone ring and passed out. 

In the morning W and I woke up early and freezing.  We had no idea when R would be coming for us, but we decided we would search around for another phone.  The night before I had heard the unplugged phone ring right in front of me, but I was skeptical.  We searched all over.  There was only one phone on the property.  It was the one sitting unplugged in the kitchen.  I looked it over.  There was nothing funny about it at all.  No batteries, no dial tone, nothing.

I just discovered this sub, and thought I might add my experience while living in a ""haunted"" house.

I moved into an old house with my mom, brother, and little sister that was nestled in the center of town. This was about 4 years ago, I was in high school then. Immediately, I didn't feel comfortable in the house. Not only was it small, dingy and old, but there was just something about it that I didn't like, that I couldn't really explain.

Shortly after moving in, I remember telling a friend of mine from school about the house. 

""Oh, *that* house? I've heard things about that place. They say it's haunted"".
I remember that he told me specifics about why exactly there was reason to believe it was haunted, but unfortunately, I can't remember what he told me. My memory isn't very good. I vaguely recall that he told me it had something to do with someone committing suicide in the house, but I could be wrong.

The house was small, like I said, one level. There was a small hallway that connected my brother's room to the bathroom. I hated that hallway. And I never knew why. We had been there for about a month when I noticed that my brother, every time he had to go through the hallway to get to the bathroom, would walk *extremely* fast, and sometimes even run through it. I asked him about it. He told me that he didn't know why he always felt the need to run through it, that it just freaked him out. This bothered me, since I felt the exact same way in the hallway and had never talked to him about it.

One day, maybe 2 months after talking to my brother about the hallway, I was in the house alone, my brother was out and my mom and little sister were in the yard. I was in the hallway and suddenly, I burst into tears. I started sobbing uncontrollably. There was nothing going on with me at the time- it was a perfectly normal day and I had absolutely no reason to be upset about anything. But I just broke down and felt the most intense sadness I had ever felt in my life. I ran outside, still sobbing, to my mom. She freaked out and asked me what was wrong. All I could say was ""I don't know, I don't know what happened"" through my tears. I calmed down after a few minutes, and both my mom and I were terrified. It still bothers me when I think about it. I always believed that ""paranormal entities"", for lack of a better term, are merely traces of intense emotion (that often leads to death) left by an individual. I think I may have experienced traces of that emotion that was left behind.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1gw92a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gw92a/me_i_think_something_went_down_in_this_hallway/,

I haven't ever posted it anywhere or written it down, but i just recently discovered this subreddit so i decided i might as well post it. I'm going to preface this story with the fact that both my parents and brother do not believe in many paranormal things-although it does interest them- but they still can't explain any of what happened. So here goes:

About 7 years ago, I lived in a house that my entire family now believes to be haunted. I was very young at the time, so i don't really remember much, but my parents and my older brother do. Anyway, tings used to happen occasionally. Small things, like doors opening, lights being left on, things like that. The laundry room light would never stay off, for example. Nothing too major, but noticeable. One of the first things major that happened, was that one day when my grandmother came to visit, my parents and her were on the porch, and saw a shadowy, eerie looking figure walking through the path in the back yard (It was a huge back yard, like a small fenced in forest) and it seemed to be a young looking girl in a wedding dress, but before they could go investigate, she vanished. That's when they said they got pretty freaked out, but sort of brushed it off, even though they all saw it. Not too long after, my dad was doing some yard work in the back and noticed something strange. There was a pile of rocks, with a flowery bush at the end of it, and he immediately went to the neighbors to ask, because he was afraid it could be a grave. The neighbors said that there had been a family who lived there before us who had a daughter that died the day before her wedding, which was supposed to be in the backyard. they said they were never sure if the pile of rocks was a grave, or just some sort of memorial to her. Regardless, it was a terrifying thing for him to hear. About a day later, me and my friend (I was like 11 at the time) decided to go investigate the ""grave"". Being the idiot kids we were, we started to dig up the rocks. We got down to one of the last lefels of rocks, and could see a clear plastic tarp under them, but my dad came out and stopped us before we got any further. That night there was an enormous storm. The stor brought down some trees around our house and one in the backyard, near the ""grave"". My dad went out the next day to saw the tree up and move it out of there. As he was sawing on the bush right in front of the grave, was a raven. A raven with the bluest eyes i have ever seen. My dad brought me and my brother out to see it, and we even tried to scare it away, but it wouldn't budge. My dad even was using a chainsaw right next to it and it would not leave. He got way to scared and decide to call it quits and cut it once the raven left. About two days later, my mom was working home alone, when she heard something that sounded like an explosion. She went out to check on what it was, and saw that the gall table on our deck had *exploded*. Not just broken like something fell on it, but shattered into pieces slightly bigger than a grain of rice. They had gone everywhere. My parents were so freaked out by what had happened, they made me go back outside and put everything back on the grave the best i could. Nothing that weird happened again, aside from the doors opening and the lights turning on. But you bet your ass we got out of their within a year or two. 

So that's my story. Sorry it's lengthy, i just wanted to include as much as i could remember from what my parents told me about. If you guys have any questions, just ask.

      A few weeks back at approximately 6:25, my friend, Matt, and I were at our local park taking a break from skateboarding half the day. We were sitting by what the town calls ""The Grassbowl"". It's a bowl, of a grass. About 300 yards in length and say 50 yards in width. The lake is very close to this park.
      Matt had to go to the bathroom. So, he takes off to the bathroom down by the lake. While down there, this unknown man rides by on a bigger sized tricycle. He waves at me and yells ""Hi!"" I wave back smiling, and he stops his bike. 
      I talk to myself, whispering under my breath ""Oh god. I hope he doesn't come over here."" He does. 
      ""Hi buddy."" He says. ""What's goin on?"" I suspect he is mentally handicapped, but being nice I reply smiling with ""just sitting down. Taking a break."" 
       I pray to god that Matt is heading back up here. I look towards the bathroom and see that he is coming back. I sigh in relief, thanking god under my breath. 
       Matt comes over and sits down, asking who this guy is. I shrug my shoulders. 
       The man then tells us to flip our hands so our palms are facing the ground and place our right hands on top of our left. We both comply and he takes a look at both our hands. Noticing that Matt has his phone in his hands. He asks him to place it on the ground. He complies and sets it no more than 10 centimeters away. Once he does that a lady rolls up in a black Scion. One of the ones that looks like a cube. I can see her through the dark to tinted windows. She glances over at us and stops the car. She gets out of the car and looks at the man. She yells at him ""PHIL!"" 
        He doesn't notice her, or maybe he ignored her. She yells his name again ""PHIL!!"" This time… just slightly louder. He doesn't look up at her. She yells at him once more, this time at the top of her lungs ""PHIL!!!"" 
        He looks up and sees her. She gestures at him to go over there. He doesn't. She then tells us ""Hey guys, don't play the hand game"" 
        We both immediately separate our hands and grab our phones. I dial 911 just in case something could've happened. My finger hovers above the ""call"" button. She yells his name again. And tells him to go over there. This time he does and they start to talk. I couldn't hear them but I could make out one sentence ""I'm going to call your home, okay?""
        We both say to each other "" I wonder what the fuck the 'hand game' was. "" we shrug it off and head up to McDonald's for a bite to eat. 
        Later that night at 11:00. I get ready for bed. I crawl into the covers and shut my eyes. ""Hi buddy"" runs through my mind. 
        1 hour later, I'm still up. Unable to sleep. So, I roll over and turn the television on. A show I've never seen before is on. ""Hi buddy"" it says. I immediately turn it back off and walk to the bathroom. I splash my face with water and take some aspirin pm. I go back to my room and get under the covers. I'm finally able to sleep. 
        I dream of him. ""Hi buddy!"" And his hands are in the position he tried to get our hands in; palms facing the floor, right hand on top of the left. I wake up. Sitting on my skateboard, covered in sweat. As I was at the park. I look at the time and its 3:00 AM. I decide not to sleep for the rest of the night. Sitting up in my bed until sunrise. 
        I call Matt at 9:00 and ask him if he would like to skate that day. He said no because he's hanging out with his girlfriend that day. 
        11:00 am, I'm sitting in my room with the blinds cracked. 
        I take a look outside and just kind of stare at the house across the street. I see Phil riding down the street on his bike. I close the blinds immediately and get under my comforter. Shielding myself from anything. I hear a knock on the door. I don't get up in fear that it would be him. The knock happens again. But this time on my window. I peek out from under the comforter and look at the window. There's no one there. Nothing. 
        I'm now staying at my uncles in the guest room. I haven't had any encounters with him since. 
        Im not sure why this is happening. I talked to Matt about it and asked him if he has been having any of these strange encounters. He said he hasn't.
         If I have any more encounters with him. I will post again.

i was 13
my brother was 7 we lived in a flat next to my parents house because we owned both of them and he what kids don't want their own house?
the previous owners were notoriously druggo's with connections
i was sleeping in his room because he had been having increasingly bad dreams
and i really enjoy camping

anyways i dont dream.. well rarely, i close my eyes it goes black i wake up in the morning survive and repeat. so this dream i had was out of the ordinary more so than it normally would be, the dream went like this "" i walked into my room  (which had a massive wardrobe that wouldnt shut properly it was always about an inch open and pitch black on the inside) and there was my little brother standing infront of it just staring at the closet , then it started to open slowly and these... i dont know how to explain it, long bubbly elongated fingers ending in a sharp point slid out of the dark gap and caressed the wardrobe then i blinked and they were caressing my little brothers face and this woman was leaning behind him looking at me with hollow black eyes and a cracked black smile the only noise i could hear in this dream was my heart beat, and then she shreiked HE'S MINE and flew back into the wardrobe when it flew shut i was already halfway over the bed when this happened and by the time i stumbled to the wardrobe it was shut
so i flung it open to go after my brother and she was an inch or two from my face and i looked down and her hand was in my chest 
then we bok looked in the direction of a loud bang.
thats when i woke up to my little brother climbing down off the top bunk the loud bang was the steel ladder, he stumbled passed me half asleep and i said ""gus"" ? 
he turned around slowly and looked at me and mumbled yes
i asked him what he was doing up this late 
he said he was just going to the toilet
i asked him if he's like me to turn the light on for him and he answered hastily no.
he walked out of the bedroom mumbling to himself 
i was still wrapping my head around my dream/ night terror
after i had processed it i realized Gus had been gone a little while, longer than he usually did 
and i hadn't even heard the toilet door shut and there was no light coming from the bathroom outside my room.
i launched out of my bed knocking my deodorant off his bedside table and ran out into the narrow hallway which was pitch black.
i checked the bathroom and he wasn't there. then i checked the living room where the Xbox was , i thought he was being a cheeky little one and playing it at 2 am, then my blood ran cold and i realized i hadn't checked my bedroom
i walked in and he was there. just standing in front of the wardrobe looking into the darkness.
i was hesitant at first
so i asked him simply"" Gus what are you doing?"" he just kept staring  and mumbled ""you'll see"" 
then i heard the soft creak of the hinges of the wardrobe
it took a second to register 
it was opening
slowly it began to swing open.
i didn't think i just jumped forward and dragged his little ass back to his bunks i forced him back up on top of the bunk and told him not to move, he just lied there, silently, i picked up the deodorant and my lucky lighter in the top of the bedside table. and i just sat there for what felt like eternity
just watching the door with my deodorant and lighter scared out of my mind staring into the blackness that was what was outside the door
every now and then i would see brief movement outside the door
eventually the first rays of sunshine crept through the window and i allowed myself to close my eyes for a moment. when i awoke my deodorant was on the window sill, my lighter was on the floor
the door was closed and my chest hurt quite violently.
i sat up quickly and looked beneath my shirt with my hand
when it came back out it was covered in blood
my blood. in my shock i jumped up and  hit the top of the bunk.
then i woke again. i am certain that before i let my eyes rest it was not a dream 
i pinched myself to see if i could register pain, i was in control of my actions and i was genuinely scared shit-less
my brother was non the wiser to what had occurred the night before

the only rational thing i could imagine is that he was sleep walking and i was experiencing hallucinations from... dehydration? heat stroke? i don't know, believe me i wish i could tell you all it was a dream but iv seen that lady again after that, watching us through the window. i am sharing this because hey why not but i am also curious, have any of you Redditers experienced anything like this before ? id like your opinions as to what really happened that night

It was night. I was in my room, lights off and laying awake. It usually takes me about 30 minutes to fall asleep, so I was in that period of waiting for sleep to overtake me. And at some point during this period, I heard something that instantly removed any desire to fall asleep.

It was a scratching at my door. It sounded as if an animal were dragging its claws against the lower portion of the wood.

Normally, this wouldn't bother me, as my family had a cat that would often do that in an attempt to be let into the room. Yet this time, for reasons unknown, the scratching inspired a sense of panic and terror in me.

Somehow, I knew it *wasn't* my cat on the other side of that door. And when I finally mustered the willpower to get out of bed and open the door, my fears were proved true.

The cat wasn't there. And after looking for her, I discovered that she had been had been in my brother's room, behind a closed door. He also confirmed that she had been in there the whole time.

This occurred back when I was in the 4th grade (now 18 years old). Because my siblings were both in junior high, and I was in elementary school they got home from school an hour later than me causing me to be home alone during that time gap. I was never particularly frightened of being home alone, I mostly just stayed in my room. 

Towards the end of the school year I began to have a recurring dream about a man waiting for me when I came home from school and binding me until the rest of my family came home where he bound them too. At first i wasn't scared, after all it was just a dream. eventually after witnessing the same dream over ten times in two weeks I was very worried and paranoid. I told my parents and they told me it was just a nightmare and not to worry. 

Anyways I began to get scared as soon as I came into the house after school. Scared to the point that I would leave and sit in my yard waiting for my brother and sister to get home. One day I opened my door and decided that it was time I got over this because nothing had happened. I walked to the kitchen to grab food, I immediately felt more fear than I had ever felt in my life and grabbed a small kitchen knife. I almost felt like I was prompted to protect myself. from the kitchen I had a direct line of sight to my bedroom where my door was wide open. I stared at my door and witnessed it slam shut with tremendous force. I opened my back door and ran to my neighbors until my siblings got home. I told my brother what had happened and together we opened the door to my room. My window was wide open. There no was screen due to my cat scratching them, just an open window into the outside world. To this day I'm not sure what was in my room, maybe the wind slammed the door shut somehow. I'm just glad that I didn't go straight to my room because who knows what might have happened or what I might have seen.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1dbkyj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1dbkyj/man_in_my_house_after_similar_recurring_dreams/,

I'm the youngest of 9 although I only grew up with 5 of them; 4 sisters and 1 brother. This story involves the sister closest in age to me, she's 3 years older than I am. 

We pretty much had a shared vision. It's weird. We were driving to meet up with my mom at a gathering just over an hour away from where we were. I was the one driving, she's in the passenger seat up front with me.

There was a long straight stretch of highway, early afternoon, beautiful sunny day. Farther up ahead parked on the left side of the road I could make out what appeared to be an ambulance. This ambulance looked as though it was driving the same direction I was heading and pulled off to the left side of the road instead of the right. So basically it was facing oncoming traffic.

I could see that the back doors were open and what appeared to be a paramedic placing someone onto a stretcher and into the back of the ambulance. 

As we got closer and closer, I'm not really sure what happened. As I replay this in my mind right now, it's at this point where I viscerally feel an odd sensation run through my body.

Because as we got nearer to what I could swear was an ambulance, all of a sudden I looked again and it turned out to be 4 motorcyclists parked on the side of the road facing us and the closer we got, they pulled off and continued on travelling, passing us by.

I was so incredibly confused for a good 30 seconds before I blurted out, ""Where the hell did the ambulance go?!""

My sister blurts out, ""You saw it too?! For a moment I was seriously considering myself insane for thinking those 4 motorcycles was an ambulance at first!!""

She went on to explain she thought there was a stretcher and a person by the ambulance and I told her it was exactly how I saw it.

As we continue on our journey, trying to make sense of what the hell we just saw, in totally confused and incredulous state of minds, there were several bends in the highway up ahead.

As we're wondering about this phantom ambulance that we both now swear we saw, what kind of vehicle comes barreling around the bend ahead of us? A fucking ambulance! 

Our jaws drop and she points at it. We're now wondering what the hell is happening. We just lit up a couple of cigarettes and continued on. Still have no clue or explanation but we swear to god there was an ambulance, a paramedic &amp; a stretcher on the side of that road before turning into 4 motorcyclists.

----

Here's another story involving the same sister. Story above probably took place about six years ago. This next story takes place a year later. 

I was still living with my mom when my sister came to visit for the weekend. She was living about 8 hours away with her boyfriend and several cats. 

She slept in my room with me during her visit and on the last night, she fell asleep first while I was beside her reading with the lamp on.

Side note: I also had two cats but I never let them in at night otherwise they'll keep me awake doing regular cat things in the dark. So I knew going into bed that after shutting my door, there were no cats in the room. 

Shortly after shutting off the lamp to go to sleep, I was rustling around in bed, trying to get the blankets just right.

A moment after I finally settled in, something jumped onto the end of the bed where my feet were and I felt what was a bigger cat (one of my 2 was a bigger heavy cat) take several steps on the bed. 

I paused, my heart started beating faster, I knew there were no cats in the room and I turned my light on to double check and sure enough, there was nothing on the bed, both cats were not in the room either.

I ended up falling asleep and woke up the next morning before my sister left to go back home. I told my mom &amp; sister what happened the night before and my sister said she had no clue, she passed out right away and didn't feel anything.

So she leaves. Later that night she called crying. She called to say that while she was here visiting us, her older cat had suddenly died. He was bigger heavy cat. Her boyfriend didn't want to tell her what happened over the phone while she was here with us and waited till she got back home.

What I felt jump into bed the night before was the spirit of my sister's cat coming to say goodbye to her.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1db2wt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1db2wt/various_odd_creepy_stories_me/,
1365561657.0,16,self.Thetruthishere,1c1c8m,[FAM] Grandparents' trailer on an island,settec,19,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1c1c8m/fam_grandparents_trailer_on_an_island/,"I have a few stories about my grandparents' trailer that I thought might interest a few people here. These happened to my family members. 


My mom told me these stories, so I know that these are true and not embellished in any way. Moreover, she is not one to believe in this kind of thing, but rather more likely to rationalize it. These took place at my grandparents' trailer that they lived in when they were older. My mom is the 7th of 13 siblings; the youngest, my uncle, lived with my grandparents and the trailer went to him upon their deaths. The trailer was located on a small island with a community with at most 100 people, on a large lake. The island in general is a fairly 'dark' place - suicides, many addictions, etc. 


The first involves my Aunt, one of my mom's younger sisters (in her 30s at this time) who was at the trailer alone. She was in one of the bedrooms with the window facing away from the lake when she faintly what she described as giant chains dragging. The trailer is set back maybe 500 m at most from the shoreline, which itself was maybe 1 mile from the mainland. My aunt said it sounded like it was coming from across the lake. The sound continued, getting louder and louder and sounding closer and closer, coming over the lake. The sound of large, heavy chains dragging continued until it sounded like it was right outside the trailer, then under the trailer at which point the sound stopped. 


At another time, my cousin (much older than me) who would have been around 20 at the time was at the trailer with my grandfather, who was sleeping in his room (and was quite old at this point). She left, but realized she had forgotten her jacket and went back to get it. When you go in to the trailer, to the right is the living room area, directly in front is the kitchen area, and to the left a wall and a door to the hallway which runs down the left end of the trailer, where my grandfather was in a room sleeping. She went in to get her jacket, she heard my grandfather's distinct sound of slippers shuffling down the linoleum floor from his room at the far end of the trailer, coming down the hallway towards the door. When it sounded like he was right on the other side of the door, she said ""papa, it's only me coming to get my coat"". No response, so she opened the door, but no one was there. Went to his room, there he was, still in bed, sleeping. Like I said, my grandfather walked slowly without picking up his feet creating what sounded like a shuffle, so there's no way he would have left the room and made it back without her hearing. 


The last instance occurred when another one of my aunts, her husband, their approx. 2 year old son, and my other uncle were walking up to the trailer from outside. My cousin, Ronald, was laughing and pointing to the right front corner of the trailer and giggling. When they got in, he continued laughing and pointing at the same corner. Nothing was in the corner, except a little ornament fireplace. The three of them were pretty confused as to what he was laughing so intently at, my aunt went to go check out the corner and was reaching to put her arm down there when my cousin yelled ""no mommy, he doesn't like that!"" The lights started flickering. A few seconds later the overhead light which was directly above a table in the kitchen/next to the living room area blew out and burnt a hole in the linoleum. Glass fell on the table, where my uncles were sitting. The globe from the fixture was broken. My parents bought the trailer from my uncle and we can still see black smoke around the globe. 


There are a few more stories, but these are the ones that stick out in my mind. As I mentioned my parents bought the trailer several years ago, they are strong Christians and my mom prayed throughout the house when they first got it and she says nothing has happened since they've had it. 


Anyway, I thought some of you might find these interesting. Feel free to comment if there's a rational explanation I'm over looking - I'm definitely not asserting that these have a strictly paranormal cause.  Also: sorry of this turns into a wall of text. Relatively new to reddit and unfamiliar with the formatting.

Anyway this just happened and I'm kinda freaked out. My mom and I were sitting around talking about how we aren't going to be at the house tomorrow and from down the hall we heard ""Why aren't we going to be here?"" Needless to say we just kinda stared at each other. Then she told me about a few other stories that happened within the last month.

As my mother was getting ready for work in the morning she put her phone on the couch in our living room and went to the bathroom to finish her hair. When she came out to look for her phone it wasn't there. When she finally found it, it was in front of the closet by the bathroom... 3 rooms and a long hallway away from where she left it

2 weeks ago we had a huge snow storm and my brother and I were at my fathers house. As she was lying in bed for the night she heard fast heavy footsteps coming down the hall towards her room. Needless to say she was freaked out but nobody was there. 

The day after she heard our front door open and close and our mailbox on our house open and slam shut (it's metal and very squeaky) when she checked there wan nothing there and no footsteps in the snow.

One day after my mom got back from the grocery store I stood at the door and asked if she needed help with the bags. I heard a ""SHHHHHHH"" and was pushed outside hard enough to almost fall over.

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can hear the closet in the hall rattling as if someone is pushing on it from the inside.

This one was a while ago but I had a dream I was in my basement and I was surrounded by an oppressive darkness and felt ""entities"" around me. They felt angry and I had the feeling I was somewhere I shouldn't be.

And these texts happened last night. None of them on the right are me, sorry I don't know how to make a real link :-/

1364002794.0,17,self.Thetruthishere,1au3n3,[ME][FR][PIC] Ghost hunt in rural Sweden (Grästorp),Hexates,22,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1au3n3/mefrpic_ghost_hunt_in_rural_sweden_grästorp/,"Apologies in advance if this tale seems rough around the edges or hazy on the details, it was a few years since this heppened.

So a few years ago (10th of October 2010 I think) a friend of mine talked me into joining her for a ghost hunt, or it might have been me who talked her into letting me tag along.
For the sake of this post we will refer to her as ”E” since I don't think she'd appreciate her name being spread all over the Internet.

Anyways, she had set up a trip with two semi-seasoned ghost hunters and they were going to visit an abandoned farm located outside a small town called Grästorp.
She had visited the place a few years earlier with some other friends, I think they were from her school, and apparently one of her friends had shown some signs of possession briefly, which made me far more interested since possessions are quite intriguing.

Anyways, we met up with the ghost hunters in a town close to Grästorp and drove out there at about 23:00 or something. The farm was not difficult to reach, it was located just off a main road. 
When we got there it was sometime around midnight, it was pitch-black and very cold.
I had brought my camera along, a Canon 1000D if you're curious, and took pictures of most everything.
The old derelict barn further added to the creepy atmosphere of the place, but we had flashlights and  I was not there alone so I wasn't afraid.
E claimed that there was supposed to be an old house at the farm where the family had lived, but we did not find it.
We did however find an old small farmhouse that I we guessed had been a sty or something similar. We placed a lamp in there to illuminate the darkness. On the floor, various pieces of old junk was placed. Old newspapers, empty bottles and that sort of things. 
The ghost hunters had brought with them EMF-meters that they checked, but as far as I recall they did not seem to give any special readings.
They wanted to investigate the sty more but we also wanted to check the rest of the farm so we decided to check the rest of the place first and then return there.

We wanted to get into the barn, sadly the doors appeared locked as we could not open them and we weren't quite in the mood to break stuff. One of the ghost hunters managed to get this photo [vortex](http://imgur.com/a/nyukp#0) of one of the windows of the barn. There was no smoke or anything visible to the naked eye. I'm still not quite sure what to make of it.

Anyways, after making our way around the farm we got back to the sty (or whatever that building had once been) and decided to do an EVP. We turned of the lights for a minute or so while we recorded (I still have not heard the EVP) and after we turned the lights back on again they did some tests with their EMF-meters, they probably didn't react and if they did I don't recall.

This is where the story gets interesting. 

I stood with my back towards the opening where the door had once been when suddenly I heard a sound from behind me, like a small creature moving through the dried leaves.
I spun around as quick as I could to catch sight of the creature but there was nothing there. I asked the others if they had heard anything  and I think they had.
E and one of the ghost hunters had been standing right in front of me, the other ghost hunter had been standing in front of me and to the right and she claimed that she had seen something lifting my coat (she was the one who captured the picture of that vortex).
I dunno if there actually was a ghost or something that had lifted the edge of my coat or if she had just seen the tip of my coat rise as I started to spin around, nevertheless the sounds I had heard had made me very unsettled.

Shortly after we packed up and left and I have nevere gone back there since.

This loud bumping sound, like music base, started bumping loudly from somewhere in the house. I crept upstairs to investigate. It got louder and louder.

I was reading some stories on here and remembered some strange things that were happening to me while I lived in my families first house after we moved to Tennessee. We moved here from Bulverde, Texas. 

To show you where this house was located, here is a [map](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=345+East+Stevens+Street&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=36.156332,-85.498223&amp;spn=0.001514,0.00327&amp;sll=36.156423,-85.497864&amp;sspn=0.001522,0.00327&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=345+E+Stevens+St,+Cookeville,+Tennessee+38501&amp;z=19). If you look at the aerial picture it was demolished and made into a parking lot. If you go into the street view, you can see the house. 

I actually never wanted to speak about the house because of what happened there and being afraid of whatever that had happened continuing after we moved out of there. It scared me so bad I never talked or tried to think about it because of the idea that it would happen again. I eventually asked my mom and sister if anything strange happened to them while there and they said no. 

This was our first official home. We were very poor at a time and having a room of my own this size was awesome. We moved to TN with the best of intentions and things were working out great. 

I used to be scared of the dark really bad and had to have the tv or something on to fall asleep. My mom knew this and she didn't care as long as I got some sleep. This was a habit that developed up to middle school, which is where this story takes place. 

Before the really strange things started to happen, I would either have the tv on in the living room or be playing upbeat music to fall asleep. It usually worked fine. I remember one night listening to Bob Marley and having a very unsettling feeling. I had to immediately turn on my lights and slept with them on. This wasn't that big of a deal, just me becoming freaked out.

Some time passes and one day my mom and sister are out shopping for groceries. I am on my computer in my room and my sisters computer turns on, logs in, and begins playing music. I run outside and sit on the porch trying to figure out what has happened. My family gets home and my sister immediately asks why her computer is on, blaming me. 

This is when strange things started to happen more often. Every time something did happen I would immediately attempt to justify it, even if how I would justify it was ridiculous and throw out evidence of it actually happening. 

My best friend at the time came over one day and we were watching tv while browsing the internet. He begins to watch this show that, for some reason, made me feel uncomfortable. I asked him to change it and he refuses because he was becoming interested in it. Immediately the tv changes, the remote is on the windowsill away from us, and we both are kind of speechless. It flips through some channels before stopping. He responds saying,""Ooo...kay."", and we decide that is enough tv for now. 

Same friend, another day. We are both on my computer this time, I am pretty sure we were watching videos on Ebaumsworld. This is when they only updated every Monday. Just as we close the window and its on the desktop I think I can hear him breathing. I ask,""Why are you breathing so heavy?"", and he responds,""I thought that was you."" Nobody else was home but us and he instantly starts to look out my window to see if anyone was out there. By this time I am staring at the ground, unable to find a suitable justification to the heavy breathing that I could still hear. I tell him lets get some pizza and we go to the kitchen. From the kitchen, which is 2 rooms away, I could still hear the breathing coming from my room. 

This was the moment that I hated this house. We moved a few months after the breathing began and I always wondered if the strange occurrences was the reason it was turned into a driveway. Maybe other people experienced more of the same I did. I refuse to go back there though.

I have two stories to share. The first story is about an encounter with a ghost when I was younger, and the second is more recent. 

The first story happened when I was in about 6th-7th grade. 

I grew up in a small town in the mid-west. Much of the historical integrity of the town was preserved.

My friends and I were hanging out after school, outside of a supposedly haunted house. Growing up, we all heard stories about it, but none of us thought twice about it. Besides, it was daylight, and that was the last thought on our minds.

Well, my two friends were being OBNOXIOUSLY loud. They were screaming and yelling. I started to get nervous because I saw an old  man come out of the house. He didn't say a word, but I figured he was mad because of the expression on his face. I pleaded for my friends to stop, and they finally asked, ""Why?""

""Can't you see the man over there...he looks angry,"" I explained.

They looked at me like I was insane. They could not see the man. I kept pointing and thought they were playing a trick on me, and they thought I was playing a trick on them. I think we all realized at the same time that something was up, and started running away. I didn't look back.

When I have talked to my friends about it since then, they swear that they saw nobody, but I can tell you the truth something was there...

And for my next one...

I live in the Southwest near the Navajo reservation now. My friend lived outside of town on the reservation, and we decided to take a walk on some old train tracks. It was still daylight.

As we were walking on the tracks, we noticed an old lady dressed in traditional Navajo clothing approaching us. 

Now you have to picture where we were. The reservation is very quiet and empty. There were no houses nearby and really no reason for an old lady to be out in the middle of nowhere, by herself, dressed in traditional Navajo clothing. 

We kept walking and we both turned to each other. 

""Do you see that?"" I asked my friend.

We both realized something was wrong and started running away. We stopped and turned around only to see the old lady had disappeared. She was NOWHERE in sight, and there was no where she could have gone that fast. There were no trees in the area and no practical place to hide. We were convinced we saw a ghost. I still am!

We ran to the car and never went around those tracks again. 

These stories are simple, but I thought they might interest somebody!",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_19acnv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/19acnv/my_encounters_with_ghostsme/,

I never thought much about this particular part of the railroad tracks I crossed 4 to 5 times a day because it seemed pretty ordinary to me.

One day however I decided to be adventurous and on a night walk (around 8pm) I decided to venture on down to the railroad tracks and walk down a path that ran parallel to the tracks. The weird thing about this path, or what made it interesting in my eyes anyway, was the the fact that at the end of it there was nothing; there were only rocks that were arranged in a circle that sorrow des the end of the pathway. Beyond this path though there was an ""archway"" of bushes that created a tunnel and a person could easily go through here without problem.

So, I gathered my courage and went on through the bushes and after 40 seconds I stopped at the end of the tunnel and found myself in a clearing. It was dark but I could still make out everything thanks to the moonlight. Without really thinking about it, I turn around and look at something that had caught my eye, so I bent down, picked it up, and examined it with my phone light. Turned out to be nothing more than a really smooth rock. What happens next still gives me chills.

As I'm examining this rock, I hear the faintest, yet unmistakably human, voice whisper in my right ear, *""what is that?""* 

I turn around, scared as all hell but there was absolutely no one there. *No one*. I drop the rock, take off full speed, and run out of the clearing. I break past the bushes, run out of the path and don't stop until I reach my house at the end of the block. 

To this day I am shook about what happened. I know for sure there was no one in that clearing because as I stated before, it was dark but the moon was bright enough to illuminate everything in that small clearing. I used to always be a skeptic about the supernatural and I guess in some ways I still am, but I am damn sure of what I heard that night 5 years ago. That's enough for me to keep my mind open to the possibilities of the supernatural.

1361231969.0,17,self.Thetruthishere,18s7w6,There's something in the attic.,,25,8,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18s7w6/theres_something_in_the_attic/,"When I was 10 years old, my family and I lived in a large farmhouse. It wasn't just an old farmhouse....this house was something unique. It had several rooms that were almost separate from the house. There was one room in the front of the house with a sealed opening in the ceiling that led to somewhere...we never opened it (not till later in the story). This room had floors that seemed hollow. It was either added later, or much older than the rest of the house. There were other rooms...the oddest rooms, thinking back on it. They led out of the back of the house. They were very decrepit, in increasing intensity, as you came closer to the exit. These rooms no longer even had floors. Just broken cement and dirt, but you could tell they used to be used for something...but not for many many years. I believe there were 4 ""odd"" rooms in total. The rest of the house was immaculate. Multiple winding staircases. Beautiful hard-wood floors. Giant open rooms with high ceilings. 100 years ago this house would have been truly a sight to behold.

I'm getting goosebumps and tearing up...thinking about this story. In the upstairs bathroom there was a tiny sealed door. Again, we lived in the house for a few years before we decided to open it up. My brother and I slept in the same room, right next to this bathroom. At night we would hear things. ""Bumps in the night"" were very common in this house, and we as a family acknowledged, and accepted them.

After maybe a year of living in this house these bumps turned into crashes. Everyone in my family slept upstairs...and all through the night, there would be sounds coming from the bottom floor. It sounded like something walking around...tinkering with things. It was a pretty weird thing for us as a family to talk about, but my brother and I shared many sleepless nights together, and tried to assure each other that we weren't going insane.

Eventually this thing...started coming up the stairs at night. I can't describe the terror my brother and I shared. This thing would slowly walk up the creaky stairs, and into the bathroom, and never come back out. I remember my brother and I crying together....saying ""please just go away"".

It got worse. We started experiencing anomalies during the day. We would hear people talking in a far off area of the house. My brother claims that ""something"" pushed a small bookshelf onto him. (I didn't see this, but saw the aftermath of him crying, covered in books). Things were going missing. We were all starting to get a bit freaked out. I remember my mother jokingly ""talking back"" to whatever would speak in far off areas of the house. She called it ""Charlie"".

Whatever the fuck it was, was starting to really scare my brother and I, despite our Mothers sense of humor towards it. It seemed to be mainly residing in our ""half"" of the house.

We started hearing pounding, and scratching....even crying, coming from the small sealed door in the bathroom. This occurrence was irrespective of time of day. When this started happening, we really became horrified. We refused to use this restroom. We were losing sleep over this. It quickly became ""an issue"", but we got through it somehow, despite the terror filled nights of no sleep. I can't imagine being alone through it all.

One day we decided to open up the sealed room above ""the odd room"", just out of curiosity. We thought there might be valuables up there, as this was a VERY old house. There was nothing leading up to this opening to climb on, so we had to stack up whatever we could find, and made a sort of make-shift staircase. I was the first and only to enter.

As I slid open the wood panel, dust came rolling out...this room obviously hadn't been opened in a countless number of years. The only light was that which was shining in behind me. It had been dark for decades....

As I stood up, on the peak of our make-shift staircase, I heard a rattling sound. I was immediately alarmed. I regretted it already, but I had come this far. I looked into the darkness...and something was looking back, from the far side of the severely cluttered attic. As we locked eyes....whatever it was panicked, as did I. There was a loud crash, and all I could see was a pale white colored...something darting across the attic. I screamed at the top of my lungs, and the make-shift staircase collapsed beneath me as I toppled to the ground.

I immediately ran to my Mother and informed her...""There's something in the attic! I saw it! I swear to god!"" she replied simply ""What were you doing up there? Don't ever go up there again."" and I obeyed. I don't know if she was too lazy to look for herself, or if some part of her didn't want to know, but she certainly believed me.

Fast forward an unsure amount of time (maybe months). I had grown to accept my fear as a constant, and I was somehow re-empowered, like never before. Now that I had seen what was in the attic, I had to find out what where that tiny door in the bathroom led.

In a somewhat less formal manner, I broke the seal on the tiny door in the bathroom. (I don't know what to call this door exactly. It looked like a cupboard door.) As I swung it open, to my horror, it revealed the attic from the opposite end! I slammed it shut, locked it, and never inquired within again.

I'll start off with a little back story, but I'll try not to ramble too much about unimportant crap.

Growing up, I had an alcoholic, drug addicted father. Not a horrible guy or anything, he was a friendly drunk. He was always funny, goofy, and everyone always liked him, but I was too young to realize that he was wrecked pretty much 24/7. As a child, I always thought my dad was really funny, so at night I would have him come in and tell me bedtime stories. He would tell the most ridiculous stories that would end up keeping me awake and laughing for hours. Then, it would always end the same way, my old man would pass out in my bed while I would lie there wired and wide awake.

This was a pretty regular occurrence, but one night, after my dad had passed out, I was lying in bed wide awake, staring at the open bedroom door out into the hallway. I did this all the time because I was afraid of the dark, and our hallway light was kept on at night. You know, usual scared little kid stuff. Then, I watched a kid walked into my room from the hallway. He looked to be around the same age as me, maybe a little older. He had very light blonde hair and was wearing navy blue slacks and a Light blue polo shirt. The thing is, the kid was all blurry. The only way I can think to describe it was he looked almost pixelated. That's not quite right, but it's the best comparison I can think of.

The kid stopped right inside my door and looked at me. He just smiled and waved like he was happy to see me. Looking back on it, there was really nothing threatening about it at all, but holy damn if I wasn't terrified at that moment. I had a huge fear of ghosts and it felt like one of my biggest fears was coming true. I grabbed my old man and started shaking him, trying to wake him up. That, of course, didn't work. He was out. The whole time, the kid was still standing there, just watching and smiling. Once I realized my dad wasn't going to wake up anytime soon, little kid logic kicked in and I buried my face in the covers.

Once I was feeling brave enough, I looked up and the kid was gone. After the whole experience I spent quite a while hiding behind my dad until I eventually fell asleep. Being my first big experience with something that scared me so badly, I remembered it vividly ever since. So after several years, my folks decide to send me to a catholic school. I was really disappointed to find out that I had to wear a uniform. Navy blue slacks and a light blue polo shirt. Huh.

As soon as I found out, my mind went straight back to that kid in my room. I still can't help but think that maybe he was trying to let me know something about my future. I don't know, but It definitely stuck with me.

So that's it. Sorry if it's kinda long, and thanks for reading. Has anybody else ever experienced this sort of thing?",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_17cyq2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/17cyq2/friendly_foreshadowing_me/,

So I was 16 spending the night with one of my girl friends, we were having a good time talking, gossiping yada yada. When my friend, lets call her E, decided to pull out a ouija board. They have always freaked me out, but I was like yeah okay lets do it! So we are messing around with this board trying to scare each other, when all of a sudden the thing started moving. I asked her if she was moving it, she looked kinda scared and swore it wasn't her doing it. So we start to ask questions ""who are you blah blah blah"" Finally I decided to ask for a sign that someone was really there.....bad idea on my part. About 30 seconds after i asked we hear this metal on metal sound then a BAM, and part of her fan went flying across the room. Now this fan is on of the plug in ones all metal. You can take it apart like the front part off to clean the blades and what not, but there are these metal clips all around it. We went over to look at the fan and EVERY single on of those clips, at least 6, were lifted....not just a little bit lifted but like someone had yanked each one up as far back as they would go. Needless to say we freaked out and put that shit away so fast. Sure it could have been just a co-winky dink, but still totally freaked us out. She also told me in the later week/months that she kept hearing things in her closet since that day. Not sure if it was really a sign...or just...i don't know a coincident. Thoughts?

First off a little description of my attitude towards unexplained things: I pretty much try to debunk everything I hear/read from people or on the internet. But what happened to me this holiday, left me a bit puzzled. Maybe you guys can give me pointers as to what it might've been?

Last fall I drove me and my sister over to my parents who hired a little cabin in the woods for their holiday. We stayed there the weekend, and the two nights I stayed there I had unexplained noises appear and go without logical explanation.

The first night it started maybe 15 minutes after going to bed. I was almost asleep when I started hearing a metallic thumping noise, it started loud and would quickly reduce in loudness like something suspended that knocks into something and then proceeds to do it a few times while losing momentum. It was a very exact noise, it would do 4 or 5 thuds then have a short pause, and do it again. 
Sadly I am not someone of great patience, especially when I try to sleep, so after 15 minutes just as I was about to charge into the living room making my complaint, the noises stopped.

The next morning during breakfast I carefully mentioned the sounds and almost immediately my sister replied ""I thought that was you!""
Turns out, I am not crazy, and I did not dream this noise!
My parents both responded with that they had heard a loud bang somewhere in the night, a sound my sister and I had not heard.

The next night I had the exact same thing happen. It was very quiet and suddenly the banging picked up again. This time it did not last that long as my mother charged into my room. ""Did you hear that loud crash??"" she yelled looking very puzzled.
I had not. Just a repetition of that same annoying clunking sound.

The next day I took a careful look around the cabin. No upstairs to it, no noisy boiler or heating system, absolutely nothing that would or could fit into that pattern of what we'd heard.

Am I missing something very silly here?",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_14v8t7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/14v8t7/mefam_strange_noises_during_holiday/,

When I was about 10 or so, my brothers and I all shared a fairly small finished attic in our house. We each had twin beds, and my bed was the closest to the top of the stairs, but there was a landing at the top of the stairs so the bed was still a good 15 feet or so from the stairs.

The attic itself was originally not finished, and to get to the attic you opened the bedroom closet downstairs and then in the closet was a narrow wooden staircase going up.

One night I'm sound asleep and I wake to the sound of a very, very slow creaking noise, like someone was trying to tiptoe up the stairs. The stairs were old and very noisy normally, so the creaking was still pretty noticeable. I get up and walk to the top of the stairs and look down.

It's dark out, but there is a tiny bit of light coming in from outside. There are windows at the top of the stairs so I'm assuming there was at least a partial moon out. On the stairs I see a man walking up the stairs, but he's totally black. As in, he's darker than the very dim light in the stairwell. He is wearing a wide-brim hat that is rounded on top. I can tell from the shape of the hat that he is looking down, like he is watching his feet while walking up the stairs.

Then, slowly, I see the hat move as if he is looking up. The last thing I remember before waking up is that I'm back in my bed awake, it's still night, and I can't move, then I wake up and it's morning.

While googling for this I came across this site saying it's a common dream:

http://www.ghostreconparanormal.com/shadowpeople.htm

which makes it a bit more creepy to me.

Anyway, I know it was likely just a dream but to this day I get the hair standing on end thinking about it, and I can still hear very clearly in my mind the stairs creaking.

This is a true story that my grandmother told my mother, and she told me. All events in this story took place long before my birth.

My uncle, being my mother's older brother, suffered a very untimely death. He lost his life in a horrific accident at the age of sixteen, when he was in high school. My grandparents had been devastated by the loss of their son.

About a week after his funeral, my grandmother was sitting alone in her house. My grandfather had already returned to work in an attempt to keep his mind off of his loss. She heard the front door open and close gently, and then a quick pace of steps straight up the stairs and into her son's room, followed by the sound of the bedroom door closing.

Sighing to herself, she assumed that my grandfather had come home from work early and marched straight into his son's room. She let him be. She had assumed incorrectly.

About an hour later, my grandfather returned from work. He had never come home. My grandmother told him what had happened.

They found the bedroom empty, but did find something. Closure.
Their son had come home.

I chose this experience because it was the first one to be confirmed by another person without any prompting who was not related to me.

About 9 years ago I moved into my first one bedroom apartment.  It was a very small complex (only 2 buildings, all one bedrooms, about 40 apartments total) set up on  a hill, but so close to the campus of my college that it may as well have been on it.  The complex was not new, but I wouldn't call it old either, dating back to the late 1960s/early 1970s (one building from each decade--I think mine was the 70s edition).  It was a relatively quiet complex for being so close to the campus of a party school.  Mostly grad students lived there so being a 20 yr old undergrad, I kind of stuck out.  Everyone kept to themselves, but you'd share the occasional ""hey"" or nod in acknowledgement though not much more than that.  I say this because it's important to note that none of the neighbors were close enough to each other that I would have been able to share this experience with anyone in order to confirm/debunk/theorize anything.

Our apartment complex did not allow pets of any kind, but it was not uncommon for the occasional stray to wander onto the grounds, lurking around the dumpster and what not.  The ""activity"" started almost as soon as I moved in.  Every night, particularly whenever I tried to go to bed, I would hear a cat meowing very loudly.  I passed it off very quickly thinking maybe it was just a stray trying to get someone's attention.  After the 3rd time or so of hearing this, I started trying to find the source of the noise.  There were only 2 windows in the apartment (one in my bedroom that was level with the parking lot so all I could see was car tires and one in the living room that had a window A/C unit and opened to the patio/breezeway that everyone else's front door was on).  I looked out the windows to see nothing, but figured the noise either carried from somewhere in the parking lot I couldn't see or from the the breezeway on the second floor.

After trying to find the nonexistent cat, I brushed it off as being a neighbor on either side of me that had decided to get a cat and was trying to hide it from management.  The meowing started to become more frequent, happening during the day and without any kind of pattern, and given that it sounded so loud that it could've been in just the next room (my apt was only 2 rooms- bedroom or living room/kitchen &amp; I would hear it from both rooms), the illegal pet theory seemed the most logical.

But then I started seeing things.  I'd be laying in bed trying to fall asleep and get the feeling like a cat had just jumped up on my bed.  Having grown up with cats, this is a distinct feeling I am used to.  I would feel the bed move slightly as if the cat had jumped on the bed, then feel movement as if it were trying to get comfortable to lie down.  Since I would be trying to fall asleep, I wasn't always coherent and would often think it was one of my pets from home, forgetting that I was in my apt away at college, 300 miles from my pet at home.  Any time I would reach to pet the cat or go to look for it, there would be nothing there, but I could see an indentation in the blankets as if something had been sitting there.

I've had similar experiences in virtually every place I've lived--the whole feel like a cat just jumped on the bed only to find nothing there.  I always assumed it was the spirit of the family cat we had when I was born.  He essentially grew up with me, sleeping with me every night until we had to put him down when I was 14 and he was 16.  But the activity didn't end there.

When I'd be laying in bed I would see the tip of a cat's tail at the edge of the bed.  My bed sat fairly low to the ground so it looked as if a cat was walking by and I'd catch the top 3-4 inches of the gray tail over the edge of the bed as it would walk past.  Naturally, I would see the tail and look over the edge of the bed to catch the rest of the cat as it walked past, but every time I looked, there was nothing there.

Then I started seeing it in the living room.  I'll do my best to describe the setup.  (Still kind of new to reddit and what not so if I knew how to make a nifty layout of the apt for y'all to see, I would do it.  Since I don't I'll do my best to describe it.)  The living room was essentially one long rectangle.  The wall with the front door and window with the A/C unit on it was the wall the back of my futon leaned up against. The window was right next to the end of the futon on the right-hand side). The wall directly in front of the futon was where my tv/entertainment center was situated (it was shared with my bedroom closet).  Just to the right of the entertainment center was the pathway (about a foot) to my bedroom door.  I usually sat on the left hand side of the futon when watching tv since it was close to the end table.  No end table on the right hand side so I would've had to stretch to the coffee table in the center for remote, drink, etc.  

I would be sitting on my futon watching tv when out of my periphery on the right, I would see the gray cat's tail entering the room at the corner of my coffee table.  Now my coffee table had a glass top, and I never saw the cat through the top, but I also had a plethora of junk filling up most of the top of the table, obscuring my view anyway.  Well of course the tail would catch my attention so I'd lean forward to try to catch a glimpse of this cat just in time to catch the hindquarters walking past the edge of the futon.  It was always making this trek from my bedroom to the window.  The window unit was there so there was no way anything could have walked through the wall.  The cat was always solid, not misty or light, but it looked like an actual cat.  This pattern went on for months, combined with the sounds and the sensation on my bed as I was sleeping.

Now, I've always thought I've attracted spirits because A LOT of unexplainable things had happened up to that point in my 20 years, but I hadn't seen an animal.  Again, I passed much of it off as being the energy from MY cat that had followed me until I started seeing the cat.  It was always the same pattern, same direction, and I never saw more than the tail or hindquarters of this gray cat. 

I knew enough to not think I was crazy, but I needed to tell someone.  I shared my experience with my friend Gina who believed in ghosts, but still thought it odd that I would see a cat.  Even though she claimed to be a believer, I always got the feeling she was dismissing my experience as bullshit.  One day, we're both out to dinner with our friends Matt and Justin, and the topic of ghosts comes up.  I mention that I think my apartment has a ghost.  Before I could go any further, Matt chimes in, ""Yeah I've seen the gray cat."" Gina turned white as a sheet as Matt proceeds to relay the exact same description of his experience.  Apparently this had happened on several occasions while he in my apartment.  I was always there when he saw it, sometimes even sitting next to him on the futon, but usually I was in another room.  Not once had he thought to mention it because he was passing it off as an acid flashback or something.  We only tripped together a handful of times so I doubt we were having the same flashback.  Plus, he describes the experience down to every minor detail, and it was exactly the same as mine.  This was the first time I experienced something that someone else who wasn't related to me had, and as an added bonus, he was able to relay the same experience without any interference from me or prompting.  As a result, I've kind of deemed it as my first ""adult"" paranormal experience (for lack of a better description).",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_y0nj2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/y0nj2/me_fr_the_ghost_cat/,

I apologise for the low-key storytelling in my posts, I just get caught up with fear and I get nervous in my house. This is a true story of something that happened to my cousins and I about 2002/2003 during the summer.


I have a fairly large family with 10 cousins and 1 brother and our aunts and uncles would take us to Nelson Bay every year for 2-3 weeks so we could enjoy being in a different place with more sun and freedom before school started up again.


It is called 'Middle Rock Caravan Park' and the cousins and I would reside in a caravan + a tent right outside for the nights we snuck out a few beers from the cabin where the adults slept in. We came as a family but we all needed to relax, hence the separation.


One night after a day at the beach, we were sun soaked, toasted and in the mood to relax. There was nothing on tv and we weren't allowed to go to the beach alone at night because of the amount of bush surrounding the park - it was deemed to dangerous by our parents. The golden rule was to stay around the caravan and not make too much noise.


I remember the following events like it happened this morning. I had just made some hot chocolate and made my way down from the kitchen to the couch. There were 4 cousins standing to my left talking, 3 to my right sitting on another couch and 3 others were upstairs in the kitchen. When I say upstairs I mean you had to walk up 4 steps to the actual part of the caravan where the fridge and cooking appliances were installed.

Now, I was sitting on the end of the couch next to the steps and I placed my hot chocolate between my feet because I wanted to tie my shoe laces.

Our family friend who was with us stood next to me and I remember this eerie feeling entering the room because everyone just went silent.
Nobody spoke for about 5 seconds and I remember looking up thinking ""What the weird?!?!""

When all of a sudden, a black mass shot through the living room and up the stairs. I will never forget the thumping noises it made on those stairs like giant footsteps. It got really cold and the air was heavy.
It took us all a couple of seconds to realise what had happened before we panicked and ran out of the caravan. Since that night, we have slept in the tent right outside.


I figured it was a spirit connected to the location and by the end of the week we were so toasted and high on life that we had forgotten all about our encounter with this black mass.
To give some background on this following part, before I moved into this house my family and I lived in a block of flats. There were three buildings in this set of flats and we had the one closest to the backyard. What made my childhood that little more excellent was that it was a two apartment building, we lived on the 2nd floor and my cousins lived on the 1st.


Both of our living spaces had the same layout. Once you came through the front door you were standing in the space that divides the living room area to the dining and kitchen. To your right you had a corridor that ran adjacent to the entry which held the two rooms, bathroom and laundry.


Now I always knew something was up with this building because I always heard children laughing on the stairs when no one was home (we had a close family, we always knew where the others were) and I even saw an old man, dressed in light blue/white exiting the building but when I chased him to see who he was, he was gone.
Back to my original story. I thought we were safe from whatever entity decided to show itself on that night in the caravan park - I was so wrong.


From a point in the kitchen bench which faces the living room, you have an angle view of down the corridor and the entry to both of the rooms. My brother was watching tv and I was making myself a hot cup of Milo (chocolate drink for those unawares).

Suddenly, I heard thumping noises and my heart sank. I looked up and there was a black mass floating in the corridor and it dashed into my parents room. The thumping noise was so much more louder than the time in the caravan park and I remember getting really really hot.
I quickly grabbed a knife (I had watched Scream too many times and figured I better have some sort of defence) only to find nothing.


A couple of weeks later I was walking up the stairs when I saw a white flash of light before my eyes. At that moment I had the urge to tie up my shoelace which I had let get undone because I was close to my apartment anyway. The white flash was gentle, not harsh like a toothpaste commercial but almost heavenly for the lack of a better word. I walked through my front door with the intention to head straight for the kitchen sink because I could see my water bottle was empty - right as I got through there was a huge flash of light and our stove exploded. The stove straight out exploded and the part that was damaged the most from this was right next to the sink where I would have been standing if I hadn't seen the white light and tied my shoe lace.

Edit: I never figured out what exactly the meaning behind all these occurrences were. We moved house before I turned 16. I'm now 24 living in another creepy house.

First let me mention that my Uncle ( my dad's twin) died recently. Well last Friday, I woke up in my room, and because school had not yet gotten out, got dressed, made my bed, combed my hair, etc... Well as I was leaving my room I looked into my little brothers room (which is beside my room) to make sure that he was awake. He was and was already sitting downstairs eating breakfast. The only person in the room was my father dressed up in his work clothes, reaching up and turning out the room light. The light turned off, and as I passed I said good morning to him. Well, my father answered from his room, in his closet, about 50 feet away. This scared the living hell out of me because there was no way that he could have been in my brothers room at the time. At first, I thought I was just having a hallucination from being tired and all, but I immediately disregarded that because hallucinations don't turn off lights. I'm not really sure what I saw, but I think that it might have been my recently decreased uncle just ""visiting"" and I'm not sure how to feel about this because this has happened at least twice in the past eight days, and it has always been the same thing, lights being turned on and off.

1338523435.0,15,self.Thetruthishere,uf3q0,[FAM] My parents were experiencing some loud slamming noises from their attic and found their bathroom filled with white smoke.,OKwhatnow,18,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/uf3q0/fam_my_parents_were_experiencing_some_loud/,"My parents live in the part of the world where there are still mysticism and spiritualism within their culture. People often go to shamans, which sometimes are referred to as ""smart people"", if they want to have revenge or just want to enact harm on somebody without actually doing it themselves. These shamans claim that they can send supernatural beings to do whatever they would tell them to do. I personally was discreditting their claims seeing it as non-scientific and a bunch of mumbo jumbo just to rip people off.

However, I had a conversation with my parents while I was on vacation at Wisconsin Dells that literally shattered my perception of the real world and what we know about it. My mom started the conversation by complaining that they have been hearing rustling and slamming noises from from the attic at night for the past few weeks now. I though it might be mice or birds or something but my mom was certain everything there was neat and she always have someone clean it every once in a while. She then went on to describe that about a week ago she was getting ready for bed and wanted to go to the bathroom when she found the bathroom was filled with white smoke and it was filled from floor to ceiling with this white smoke. My dad, being the rational man he is, ran to the fuse box and shut off all the power thinking it might be an exposed wire that caused a spark and might start a fire. All this was really freaky because my parents are not the type to kid around or would want to make me worry about anything. This is where it got really strange. 

A couple of days after the bathroom incident my parents received a surprising visit from someone. A shaggy looking shaman came in and sat down in our living room. My parents talked with him and he explained that someone hired him to send a demon, or Djinn as he puts it, to hurt my family. He claimed that he has not heard from the Djinn for some time now. He worries that if the Djinn was not successful in its task it will have to kill the person that hired the shaman in return. The shaman accused my parents of trapping his Djinn but they do not deal with the supernatural of any kind. My mom explained what happened to her in the bathroom and he believed that his Djinn might have been defeated by a higher power and perished in the bathroom leaving a cloud of smoke behind. Knowing this he left our home and never looked back. 

My parent are very religious and very charitable, I grew up with a bunch of foster kids and our kitchen is always open to anyone who is hungry. They believe that God was looking out for them and that God has a plan for them and would not let anything harm them. I was, and still am, a very science driven person but this incident shattered my perception of the real world. I have no words to explain how I felt when I heard my parent's story. This is real.

This occurrence, though, scared me so badly that afterwards I would never come into the house alone unless absolutely necessary. 

When you entered the house, there was a small room that was bigger than an entry hallway, but not really large enough to use for anything.  These houses were built in the early 1900's when people were used to much smaller spaces.  Immediately to the left there was my sister's room (where her son had seen the strange man walk through the wall). Directly forward there was a long hallway with two more bedrooms to the left (one of which was turned into a practice room for my gf's band) and two rooms to the right which had larger, open doorways. One was a living room and the other was supposed to be a dining room but we just used it for extra furniture and hanging out.  At the end of the hallway to the left was the kitchen and the hallway dead-ended into a bathroom.  To the right, through the living room and down a step, was a huge utility room/storage room and another bathroom. (Sorry for all the description, but it's kind of important to this story.) This area was a little more secluded from the rest of the house, but still pretty close to everything.

One early afternoon, I was at home alone and was taking a bath in the second, more secluded bathroom. We all had pretty odd work and social schedules, so it was hard to keep track of who was going to be home at any given time. I wasn't sleepy or lying down in the tub where I might have drifted off into sleep. It was quiet in the house, no radio or tv on.  I heard the front door open and close and heavy footsteps come down the hallway. Someone says my name. Though immediately after, I oddly couldn't remember if the voice sounded male or female, I knew it didn't sound like either my sister or my gf. I called out my sister's name. No answer. Called out my gf's name. No answer. The footsteps still coming towards the back of the house.  I was a little nervous, but not terrified as  at that time, there were a lot of friends that would just come into the house and I had heard my name called, so they obviously knew me.

I did feel nervous for some reason, though, and yelled out that I was in the bathtub.  The footsteps stop very close to the bathroom door. I jump out of the tub and throw my robe on and immediately open the door. No one there. I walk through the living room, look down the hallway. No one. Go down the hallway, check the front door. Locked.

Definitely freaked out now, I call my sis and my gf. Both still at work. No one else has a key to the door, and even if someone had gotten in, by the time I got out of the tub and gone into the living room....they wouldn't have had time to get back out of the house.

None of us really sat down and talked about all of the stuff we saw and heard until we moved out and started comparing notes. While my gf never had an experience similar to this, my sister claims she often heard someone softly saying her name when no one else was home

I live up in Alaska and over a year ago me and my best friend (after alot of discussion, my friend is a very big skeptic, well was.) decided to try our hand at looking into the paranormal. I owned a small flip camera at the time and we walked into some woods I had always felt uncomfortable around. I didn't really expect anything to happen that night and I was right for the most part. Everything that happened that night can be chalked up to nerves and over-reacting minds. My friend, still a skeptic, thought it was fun but still thought the Paranormal wasn't really there. That changed shortly thereafter.

Our first crazy experience was on a night we weren't investigating (we had gone about three times since the first night, I don't recall anything trully good happening before this). We were up late, so this could be just our sleep deprived minds, but as college kids, we stay up all the time so we were pretty lucid. We decided to walk over to a nearby Carrs, get some snacks and what-not. It was on our way back that our experience happened. We were walking up a hill, 'bout halfway up when I glanced over my shoulder, and I thought I saw someone at the bottom underneath a streetlight. So, I pointed this out to my friend, who looked over his shoulder and nodded and said ""yeah there's someone there. So?"" We were walking through a sketchy neighborhood late at night. We continued walking, I kept glancing over my shoulder just checking on this person, who was only a dark figure (under the streetlight, so that makes sense), and to make sure he wasn't following us. He wasn't, just standing there. Than my friend looks back and asks me if I noticed the guy was following us. I told him the man hadn't moved so I glanced back and saw he was half the distance from the streetlight to us. That was when I first got frightened. The next bit might be explained away as us being scared or someone trying to mug us, but I don't believe that. We continued on (all of this is taking place within a matter of 2-3 minutes mind you), and the person keep following us, gaining on us. So we walked faster, and when we checked over out shoulders it was even closer, now about 20 feet away, we had nearly crested the hill so it was still bellow us. We kept getting faster, hopeing to get them to just give up, but it kept getting faster as well, though it didn't appear to be moving any faster. We broke out to a run when we had made it to the top of the hill and the person was now 10 feet behind us. We broke into a run, fear overtook us at that point. My friend dropped a bottle he was holding and we both turned to grab it, and saw that the shadow person was at the top of the hill. Barely five feet from us. No features could be seen and we both took off. We didn't look back, both to scared to do so. But when we made it through a small playground and back into my neighborhood we stopped and looked behind us. No one was there. But both of us still swear we could hear it behind us. Later, at my house we sat on my porch drinking some soda (childish but hey, not 21 yet.) when I looked over and saw under another streetlight that same figure looking at us. My friend followed my gaze and swore. It just stood there till we went inside, and than dissapeared. We refer to that person as the ""Chaser"".

Needless to say we didn't get sleep for sometime after that. I'm not sure if it was something paranormal or maybe we just outran a mugger but it was a jarring experience. And this was the turning point from my friend being a skeptic to a believer. I can try and provide more details if there are more questions. Also I will probably put up more experiences we have had.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_udg72,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/udg72/running_shadowmefr_xpost_from_rnosleep/,

Half scared, half intensely interested - I'm sure you know exactly how I feel.

So here's my contribution.

I live in Australia, and at the time of this event I was living in country-ish Queensland and I was 7 years old. I don't believe I've ever seen anything untoward, or been around poltergeists, etc. I've had moments of extreme fear or anxiety, believing something/s were watching me, or in the same room as me, but I have put that down to normal children's fears. 

This particular time however, I was lying in my bed (sheets up the chin, as always haha). I was not close to sleep yet; I wasn't tired, it was just my bed time. So I'm waiting to go to sleep, and in my mind's eye, I see two hands grab my ankles. At the same time, I felt them. 

They weren't hot or cold, they felt like normal hands. I have never been more terrified in my life! In my mind, they were long fingered, they hand no arms attached to the wrists. I saw them lingering on either side of my ankles (in my head, I wasn't actually looking at my feet) for maybe 2 seconds, and then they lurched forward and grabbed them. I freaked out, jumped out of bed, ran out of my room, and that's all I remember. 

I have considered that it was possibly a 'dream' type imagining in my mind, and that I 'felt' it because I was imagining it so vividly. But I have never been one hundred percent convinced of that, and the memory makes me feel sad and desperate. The feeling of the hands grabbing me was too forceful, too sudden.

My post:

Ah, off the top of my head...(sorry if the story ain't up to much, i'm just recalling as much as i can remember)
Years ago (in the early 70's) my mother was walking through Strathclyde Park (Near Hamilton, which is a town near Glasgow), with her auntie and her dog Wild. Wild was a big German Shepherd, Wild by name and nature. A big bold dog apparently, fiercely protective and afraid of nothing. Anyway, they were strolling through the park, and it was a quiet day so they let the dog off the leash. in a fairly secluded, quiet section of the park, surrounded by trees and bushes, the dog runs excitedly off ahead, around the corner out of sight. My mother and her Auntie hear a commotion, as the dog barks and growls. Wild reappeared, bolting past, running for his life. he hid behind my mother and her auntie, literally trembling, at first growling, barking and then reduced to whimpering. My mother mentioned how upsetting it was to see such a big, brave dog clearly in such distress. Now, the auntie is the typical bold as brass west of Scotland woman, so upon seeing the dog in distress decides to challenge whatever has caused it to freak out. She storms ahead, my mum following hesitantly behind her. Out from amid the bushes steps a tall (well over 6 feet apparently) and thin man. My mum describes him as 'a stereotype of what you would imagine a Victorian gent to look like': Old fashioned black suit, a long black cane, a small top hat, goatee beard and a thick black cloak. His face was dark and obscured by the brim of the hat, but there was a thin smile on his lips. Wild freaks out and runs away, back in the direction of the car park. The auntie goes to confront the man, but he turns and runs along the path...Or, rather, he didn't run, but he sort of glided, walking as normal but with exceptional speed. Hesitating for a second, a bit disturbed by this strangely dressed man who terrified the dog, the auntie composes herself and runs around the corner, yelling for him to 'get back here'. He is no-where to be seen. Maybe he jumped into another bush, but if he was on foot, there was no way he could have ran away that fast. My mum and auntie decide to head back to the car, where Wild has tried to hide beneath the car, trembling still.
The thing is, at least five years later, my mum was in another section of Strathclyde Park, at the Hamilton Mausoleum (google it if you want an image). I think the rest of her family were picnicing elsewhere (I hope that she wasn't roaming about on her own!). The Mausoleum is closed off now, but at the time (mid 70's) you could enter it and wander about (I'm sure there is some story about it being designed so that it gives the 'longest lasting echo' within any building, but i'm not sure if i'm remembering that incorrectly). So, my mum wanders in, admiring the lovely-albeit slightly creepy- interior. She is quite near the entrance, and the only one in the place. She hears echoing footsteps, and gets a bit spooked, wondering who else could be here. from out of the shadows steps a tall, thin figure...the same man, with the same dark cloak, his face hidden by shadow and his hat. he stands perfectly still, as if watching her. My mum's stomach nearly drops as she recognises the guy, looking identical to when she saw him at least five years before. He lingers for a while before effortlessly gliding past, out of the mausoleum, out of sight.
I tried to make that story as undramatic as possible, and i know that on NoSleep most people write fictitious stories, but that one is 100 percent true (unless my mum is lying, but she's a bit spooky, she's got loads of stories). Maybe he was just a creep who liked old clothes, but he seemed unworldly apparently...

About 4 years ago, I started meditating regularly. Many proponents of meditation and similar spiritual practices claim that regular practice can ""open up"" a different way of perceiving the world.  However, my whole life I have been sensitive to things that cannot always be perceived by the naked eye. In the past year, a large number of changes have taken place in my life and have changed the way I see the world. About 7-8 months ago, my vision started changing. There's really no other way to put it. There was about a week where my vision was very fuzzy, I of course attributed it to getting older and my eyesight getting worse. However, after that time, my vision actually improved. Colors, lines, shapes, textures all appeared to me much more defined and brighter, as if there had been a haze over my vision for a long time. I started seeing colors and lights around people and objects. Everything, even objects, vibrate with energy, like they're pulsating. I see geometric shapes, orbs, colors, where I would just see dead space. I sometimes close my eyes and see very clearly defined images and pictures. 
  


The same has happened with my other senses as well. Especially with my hearing. I'm a musician, and have always had sensitive hearing, so this could be why my hearing seems to be the most affected. I have different periods (this is still occurring) where my hearing seems to be muted, and muffled. Other times, the way I hear sounds is completely different. I can hear lines and sounds in music I could never hear before, and all the components sound separate but harmonious at the same time (nebulous, I know). I have heard strange things. This is where the ""crazy"" stuff starts happening. I sometimes will be in a room and hear what sounds like chimes, just this beautiful ringing sound that almost sounds like it's coming from another place beyond where I usually hear. I live in an old house, and sometimes I hear chatting, I've heard voices in my room. This could be different things I know, I live in a city and have neighbors in the same building as me. I hear lots of rushing and buzzing sounds.  I've been in a building and heard a strange sound of wind, as if I'm in a storm, and then all of a sudden the sound disappears. When I feel a presence, I feel it in my ears first, I know that sounds strange, but the pressure in my ears changes, and that's what happens when I'm around people. The freaky thing is this happens often when I'm alone and I can sense a ""presence"" around. 
  

I've become intolerant of a lot of foods, as now I can taste flavors that were not so strong to me before. For example, after I brush my teeth in the morning now, I can't eat food for hours, because it just tastes so disgusting. This never happened to me before. Also, certain foods are even more delicious than before! 
  

My skin is more sensitive than it used to me, I break out in rashes more often, and my skin gets very itchy quite often, usually after I go outside. This didn't happen to me before. 
 

 As for physical symptoms, there have been so many I don't know how to explain them! It's as if every physical/health problem I've ever experienced in my whole life is coming back/has come back in the past year. It's freaky. Migraines, constipation, nausea, severe allergy problems, flu symptoms (constantly), heart palpitations, severe neck and back pain, insomnia, chronic fatigue, the list goes on. Again, this stuff has cropped up in the past year or so. 
 

 My emotional problems have been the hardest to deal with. I've had bouts of anxiety, depression, and anger. Just randomly, I'll feel inexplicably sad, or very anxious, whichever. I've been reexamining my old thoughts and beliefs, and it seems like a lot of repressed negative emotions and problems are surfacing, many of which I weren't even aware were there. 
 

 Now, when all of this started happening I thought I was going crazy (of course, I think most people would). I know this all sounds like I'm having a psychotic episode, which could very well be the case. However, at the same time, I feel more at peace with myself, my family, my friends, and every single person I meet. My relationships have gotten healthier, I'm more open with people and have more self-confidence, and I feel more joyful and in tune with myself and with others. I know a lot of people write this off as bullshit, but I started doing research when all this started happening and came across something called ""Kundalini awakening"", which most people will say is new-agey crap, but seems to fit very well into everything I've been experiencing. There's so so much more that I've experienced in this past year, but I've already written a book. Is there anyone else that has any idea what I'm going through or has experienced something similar??

I've posted this before on /r/nosleep and after finding out about this subreddit, I figured this would be perfect to post here too.*

When I was around 9 or 10 years old, my mom and dad had finally trusted me enough to start letting me stay home on my own. I remember everyone in my family wanted to go somewhere but I felt like staying home and watching cartoons. So, after a couple of minutes, I'm finally in the house alone and I rush to the kitchen to get some sugary sweet cereal.

I spend most of my time home watching Spongebob and eating Cap'n Crunch. With me being a kid and having a short attention span, it doesn't take me long to go into a sugar rush and start running around the house just because I could. For whatever reason, I bang on the wall three times and then I hear banging on the wall from downstairs, copying my knocks exactly. I immediately square myself up. There wasn't any echo in the house, so what could this be?

I knock on the wall three times again. I hear the same knocks come from downstairs in response. I yell as loud as I can ""WHO'S THERE?!"" but no one answers. Again, I knock on the wall, four times now. I hear the same four knocks from downstairs. I then decide to lock the door leading downstairs and every other lock I could find around the house, including all the windows. After making sure everything was locked, I knock on the wall again. No response.

To this day, every time I think about it, it still gives me the willies and nothing like it has happened before or since then.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_tgpjj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tgpjj/xpost_from_nosleep_strange_knocking_from/,

So this happened when me and my family were on vacation in Pigeon Forge/ Gatlinburg. I was in highschool at the time. We stayed in a two story, two bedroom cabin in the mountainous wooded area. On the trip were me, my parents, my sister, and my grandfather who was recently diagnosed with dementia. The upstairs part of the cabin contained a bedroom and a kitchen/ living room, with narrow stairs leading down to a room with a pool table and a couch, and then to the master bedroom. My parents slept in the master bedroom of course, I slept on the couch in the room with the pool table. My sister sleep upstairs on a couch, and my grandfather slept in the other bedroom upstairs. Well second night there, thing start happening. I'm laying on the couch. Everyone else is asleep. I'm playing my gameboy, which has the volume turned all the way down, when I start hearing mumbling coming from across the room. My parents door is open, so I just brush it off sound bouncing off the wall and not mention it to anyone. The next night, I again hear the mumbling, so I walk in my parents bedroom and both are just watching tv. I ask what they were talking about, to which they reply they weren't. And they were watching family guy when it happened so it wasn't like I was hearing the tv. So I go back in sit down and I hear a pool ball roll across the table. I'm pretty scared, but you know I'm a man so I do nothing and eventually fall asleep. Next night same things happen only alot more frequently. Last night there. I'm getting used to hearing noises and pool balls rolling. All of a sudden, I hear one of the pool sticks slam onto the ground, which it was currnetly laying flat on the center of the table. Then I see this, I guess see through shadow, pass in front of the opening in front of my mom and dad's bedroom. Then I feel this ice cold/ tingly/ I really don't know how to describe it sensation on my ankle. It felt like someone was grabbing my ankle. I noped right off that couch and into my parents bed. My mom immediately says, ""You saw that shadow too then?"" I was like yeah and I've been hearing all this other stuff. My sister then runs down the stairs because she gets awakened by my commotion. I tell dad to cut the tv off  and we all hear mumbling and pool balls rolling. Mom makes dad go upstairs to check if its grandpa talking. While he is gone we continue to hear the mumblings. Dad gets back and says he was sound asleep. For anyone who wants to visit this cabin, I have the link to it right here. I've remembered the name because I want to go back and revisit it someday. http://www.cabinsusa.com/rentals/Pigeon-Forge/Pigeon-Forge/440-A-Treasure-Nest.html

I have other experiences I'll post about later, but this is the main one that really made me believe in ghosts/ spirits. Sorry about the writing, it is 7 a.m. and I haven't slept yet XD.

My parents weren't home, so we were making our own supper.  Being culinary challenged teenagers, we were making toast.   A couple of minutes after putting the toast in we both started to smell smoke.  Assuming we had somehow messed up such a simple meal, we checked out the toaster.  Everything in there was fine.  The staircase up to the second floor of our house leads out of our kitchen, so we quickly figured out the smoke was coming from upstairs.  We ran up to my bedroom and found the really large bunch of dried yarrow I had sitting on my bookshelf (It looked nice and smelled nice) on fire.  We were the only ones home, and we had both been together for a minimum of an hour.  It is impossible he had anything to do with it.  Of course we quickly put out the fire, flipped over the shelf so our parents wouldn't see the burn mark, and tried to forget about.

Fast forward to the next morning.  I woke up covered in these strange little scratches on my stomach and back.  They were perfectly straight and went from around my bra area to around where low pants would sit.  Naturally one would assume I had just scratched myself in the night, but I am one hardcore nailbiter.  I couldn't scratch myself if I tried.  Also, the scratches on my back where in such a place that I never could have possibly reached them myself.

I was pretty freaked out by this point naturally, but I still held on to the hope that possibly something in my bed was doing this.  I changed out my sheets, changed out my PJs, and went to bed the next night.  Needless to say, there were even more of these scratches the next morning.  They looked exactly like if you took a sewing needle and dragged it fairly hard down someones skin.  Odd.

One more night of this after that and I had had enough.  There is this corner in my bedroom ceiling (my parents house is a really weird shape) that no light ever gets into, regardless of which lamp and whatnot I turned on.  My best friend always refused to sleep over in my room because she was terrified of this corner.  It always scared me a little bit as well, but I tried to pay it little mind.  Finally after three nights of this, I had this feeling that the corner had something to do with it.  I stood in my room, looked directly at the corner, and told it that it had to stop and leave immediately.   It was also not allowed to touch me ever again.

The scratches stopped after that night, and I have never had them again.  I moved out of my parents house five years ago, but sometimes I still have nightmares about that room.

I'm going to be on this subreddit a lot more.

Another story I do not remember, I had to be told this. Which is even stranger because at this point I lived in NC, and I have very strong memories from living in NC rather than IL.

One night there was a torrential downpour. Just terrible. Tornado warnings, 60mph winds, cloud-to-ground lightning, the whole nine yards. I was 10 years old at the time. I have always been terrified of thunderstorms; to this day, a bad enough thunderstorm will leave me curled up in a panicky ball of tears, as a 19 year old.

This particular night was one of those times. My mom and sister knew I was scared of thunderstorms, so they didn't think anything of it when I started having a panic attack and crying, sitting by my mom's side, worried about dying. But then I started saying something oddly specific. I started saying, through sobs, ""the tree! There's a tree! It's going to fall! It's going to come through the window!""

My mother thought this was just me being worried about the tall pine trees in the back and front of our house, which were very old, and probably looked like they were going to break at any moment and come through any number of windows in our house. I kept correcting her though. I kept saying, ""no! The tree is going to fall through the window! I hope they're safe. I hope they're safe.""

At this point my mom didn't know what to do so she just started ignoring me while I sat next to her sobbing about nonsense.
However, the next day at school, she found out that a tree had gone through my best friend's bedroom window. Luckily she wasn't in it.
My mom doesn't freak out easily at all, but suffice to say this made her hair stand on end, and I can always tell that she's uncomfortable whenever I bring this story up.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_tc479,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tc479/me_if_a_tree_falls_in_the_woods/,

I live up in Alaska and over a year ago me and my best friend (after alot of discussion, my friend is a very big skeptic, well was.) decided to try our hand at looking into the paranormal. I owned a small flip camera at the time and we walked into some woods I had always felt uncomfortable around. I didn't really expect anything to happen that night and I was right for the most part. Everything that happened that night can be chalked up to nerves and over-reacting minds. My friend, still a skeptic, thought it was fun but still thought the Paranormal wasn't really there. That changed shortly thereafter.

Our first crazy experience was on a night we weren't investigating (we had gone about three times since the first night, I don't recall anything trully good happening before this). We were up late, so this could be just our sleep deprived minds, but as college kids, we stay up all the time so we were pretty lucid. We decided to walk over to a nearby Carrs, get some snacks and what-not. It was on our way back that our experience happened. We were walking up a hill, 'bout halfway up when I glanced over my shoulder, and I thought I saw someone at the bottom underneath a streetlight. So, I pointed this out to my friend, who looked over his shoulder and nodded and said ""yeah there's someone there. So?"" We were walking through a sketchy neighborhood late at night. We continued walking, I kept glancing over my shoulder just checking on this person, who was only a dark figure (under the streetlight, so that makes sense), and to make sure he wasn't following us. He wasn't, just standing there. Than my friend looks back and asks me if I noticed the guy was following us. I told him the man hadn't moved so I glanced back and saw he was half the distance from the streetlight to us. That was when I first got frightened. The next bit might be explained away as us being scared or someone trying to mug us, but I don't believe that. We continued on (all of this is taking place within a matter of 2-3 minutes mind you), and the person keep following us, gaining on us. So we walked faster, and when we checked over out shoulders it was even closer, now about 20 feet away, we had nearly crested the hill so it was still bellow us. We kept getting faster, hopeing to get them to just give up, but it kept getting faster as well, though it didn't appear to be moving any faster. We broke out to a run when we had made it to the top of the hill and the person was now 10 feet behind us. We broke into a run, fear overtook us at that point. My friend dropped a bottle he was holding and we both turned to grab it, and saw that the shadow person was at the top of the hill. Barely five feet from us. No features could be seen and we both took off. We didn't look back, both to scared to do so. But when we made it through a small playground and back into my neighborhood we stopped and looked behind us. No one was there. But both of us still swear we could hear it behind us. Later, at my house we sat on my porch drinking some soda (childish but hey, not 21 yet.) when I looked over and saw under another streetlight that same figure looking at us. My friend followed my gaze and swore. It just stood there till we went inside, and than dissapeared. We refer to that person as the ""Chaser"".

Needless to say we didn't get sleep for sometime after that. I'm not sure if it was something paranormal or maybe we just outran a mugger but it was a jarring experience. And this was the turning point from my friend being a skeptic to a believer. I can try and provide more details if there are more questions.

First post here, sorry  they're long; there's a lot of detail in them.",WestWays818,18,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/r1tw4/multiple_past_encounters_first_post_here_sorry/,"To start off, I'm on the young side (I'm still a teenager) so I don't know if paranormal encounters are more likely to happen because of this. Something you should know about me before I begin, is that my senses are a bit... Odd. While I have extremely sharp vision, I have very horrible hearing (as a result from bad Swimmer's Ear and multiple surgeries as a toddler). My skin on the other hand... Well, I have hypersensitive skin: I am Hispanic, but my skin bruises and burns like that of a Caucasian. Also, I can feel almost ANYTHING that even slightly brushes on my skin. 

The first encounter I can remember was when I was eight or so, at that time I was sharing a room with my younger sister in a house built in the 1940's. One morning my sister was in the living room with my mother, and I was laying in  bed trying to sleep in. I was laying on my stomach, my eyes close, and i thought my mother sat on my bed and started rubbing my leg to get me to wake up and get out of bed. When she didn't stop rubbing my leg, I opened my eyes and looked towards the end of my bed, only to find the room absolutely empty. After that, I would hear my name being whispered in my ear very clearly as if someone was standing right behind me. 

Another encounter occurred a couple years after, right before I moved to Texas ( lived in California at the time). My house was almost finished being packed, and my sister and I were sent to bed, as it was late. My bedroom light was off, but the hallway was lit from my mother's room, which was right across the hall. I couldn't sleep, so I lay on my back and stared at the ceiling. For some reason, I felt extremely uncomfortable almost instantly and felt compelled to look towards my door. When I did, a dark shadow (or a blurred silouhette, whichever sounds best) was standing at the foot of my bed, paralyzing me with fear. It didn't move, it just slowly waved at me, and then faded away. Needless to say, I couldn't sleep that night.

A third experience that I can clearly remember was New Year's Eve coming into 2010. By this time I had already moved to Texas, into a brand new home with my ""new"" family (my mom just got remarried to a man with three older kids). I had just gotten the iPod nano fourth generation and bought at least fifty new songs, and I couldn't put it down. My family was throwing a small party with some neighbors, so everyone was downstairs. I was asked to get something from my room, so when I went upstairs to my room to get whatever the thing was. My light was on, and I had paused my ipod. My back was facing the window, which was a straight drop down, as it was a flat wall on the side of the house where my window was. I had gotten the thing, was shuffling through the songs, PLAYED a song, and my iPod completely turned off. Exactly at this moment, I heard someone yelling my name repeatedly as if it was urgent, and then felt my shoulder being grabbed, where my name continues to be called into my right ear where my hearing is worst. It vanished as quickly as it happened. My heart was racing, but I didn't tell anyone what happened. 

My most memorable encounter was summer of 2010. I was staying at my grandmother's house, a turn-of-the-century three story home built during the Industrialization Era in downtown Los Angeles. Keep in mind, although the idea that this old home might be a cesspool for paranormal activity, I have NEVER had more than a creepy feeling during anytime, night or day, I've spent in that house. One night, while sleeping in my grandmother's room on the second floor, I had a case of insomnia, so I had decided to choose a book to read out of the vast selection lining the walls on all three floors (seriously, that house could be a public library). It was about four in the morning, give or take, and I was nearly done with the book when I thought I heard a stroke on the piano in the parlor downstairs. I waved it off, and continued reading. After a while, I started hearing two or three notes being drawn out, and thought maybe someone was down stairs (at that time it was being used as a boarding house for at least 6 different people). I continued to shrug it off and kept reading, although I let my imagination wander a bit, and considered the possibly of a ghost, which was thrilling yet terrifying - I'm not the adventurous type. The waste management was making its rounds along the street, and a lot of noise along with it, which thankfully distracted me for a good ten minutes. By the time the truck left, however, a full blown song was being played on the piano, a symphony by Bach or Beethoven, I can't remember, and I felt a chill down my spine. I mustered up some courage, and slowly walked to the door and over the banister where I could hear it best. The aging wood had creaked under my weight, and as I paused, the music stopped. Terrified, I hauled ass back to the room and locked that door! I can't remember how I was able to sleep, but when I woke up the next morning, I went down to the parlor to watch television, and ALL my grandmother's music books, which were normally inside the piano bench, were scattered all over the room. 

The last encounter that I'm going to put it just a series of things that have happened within the past couple of months. A bit of backstory: I'm living with my dad in Los Angeles, my mother still lives in texas, and the house I'm staying in belongs to my grandma, whom bought it some time in the early Fifties (it was built right after WWII in a housing community designed for veterans, but was originally a Native American ground - I just recently found both of these things out). My uncle passed away of MS in 2003 in the house, and my grandfather also passed away earlier this month of multiple types of cancer, also in this house. As my grandfather was dying, a lot of discussion came up about recurrences of paranormal things from my father, other two uncles, and my aunt (who also is dying of MS, just like my late uncle). 
A few things have happened since talk came up: my Mac computer, constantly put on sleep, is extremely sensitive in the mouse, and shows up to the user screen if the table is hit hard enough. It goes off maybe twice or three times a week (not sure if that is paranormal, but I have heard of things like that). I hear my name being whispered very clearly in my right ear a LOT. But in a Hispanic way (example: my name is Ryann, but my family members that don't speak English call me Ryanna, the apparent Spanish way to say it). When I'm laying down, most of the time sleeping, I feel what is almost an affectionate stroking of my cheek, arm or hand. Sometimes I am shaken awake and prompted to ""wake up, wake up!"" in my sleep, only to find nothing wrong. One time, A decorated cast-iron bell that was used as a signal for my late uncle (who lost the ability to speak before dying) was on a shelf in the social room was clearly and suddenly knocked off the shelf. It hadn't been moved, or even touched, in over a year. In my grandfather's last days, my dad recorded his somewhat disturbing actions on his iPhone. The entire duration of the 30-minute video, light orbs were fading in and out around my grandpa. He was hallucinating horribly, and at some points my dad swears to have seen the outlines of figures in the room. I saw nothing. My grandfather only spoke mumbled spanish, he had completely lost all ability to speak English, which he was fluent in. At certain times, he would call and reach out to deceased family members, mainly his siblings, but the most common instances were mafia members he claimed were trying to jump him and cut his ""ojos verdes,"" or green eyes out.

If you've gotten to this point, I apologize that this post is so long. I have never told anyone of any of my encounters, and it feels good to finally get them off my chest.

My Mom was a complete skeptic when it came to anything paranormal. Mind you, she was slightly superstitious. One day when I was 13 years old, my Mom and her younger sister, were sitting with me, having a drink and talking about old times.

That’s when my Aunt brought up the story of the house in Maryland. My Mom immediately scoffed and didn’t want her to tell the story in front of me, I guess because I was still young.

My Aunt told the story anyway, because as she said to my Mom, “If you don’t believe it then it won’t hurt her to hear it.”

My Mom was 17 and had married and moved out on her own, back in the mid-1950’s. I can’t remember the exact year…I’m not sure anyone ever told me.

The rest of the family, my Aunt Cissy (the youngest girl at 14), Buddy ( the next to the oldest boy at 15) and Wilbur (the oldest boy at 16), and their Mom, moved into a new home in a relatively small town. My Grandfather had passed away the year previously.

The house was huge compared to the small shack they had lived and been born , back in the mountains of Maryland. The rent was cheap too.
Apparently, the landlord owned the house and a barn that was on the small parcel land. He had never lived there himself, but it had belonged to his family for generations. 

When my Grandmother expressed interest in renting the house, the landlord showed her the barn and told her the rent was pretty cheap because he had one request. The barn doors; one-double door in the front, one single door on the side and a small door on the loft; must be kept shut and chained.

The landlord kept his brand new trailer in the barn. My Aunt described it as, “one of those silver shiny things that hitch up to a car.”
My Grandmother, loving the cheap price agreed, and it wasn’t long before the family moved in. My Aunt said that immediately, the “weird stuff” started happening. 

The house consisted of a large living room that led into the kitchen, which had a back door and the yard in the back had a woodshed and a stump set up for cutting wood on it. There was a large pantry in the kitchen and a utility room off the living room.

The upstairs had 3 bedrooms, Buddy and Wilbur shared one room, my Grandmother and Aunt each had their own room. There was also an attic. The attic door was at the top of the stairs, next door to Buddy and Wilbur’s room.

The night after moving in, everyone had just gone to bed, and my Aunt immediately heard Wilbur and Buddy arguing.

“Get your cold feet off me!”

“I don’t have my feet on you.”

My Aunt said they quieted down but it wasn’t long before they started again.

“I said get your cold feet of me, Wilbur!”

“You get your cold feet off ME!”

It must have dawned on both of them at the same time that the cold they were feeling wasn’t from their brother because Aunt Cissy said, they both screamed.

My Grandmother told them to shut up and go to sleep. She was a no nonsense woman—or as my Mom use to say, “She was a bitch.”

The next morning, the family found out why the landlord insisted on keeping the barn doors shut. That morning they came out to find ALL the doors wide open. Every morning, while they lived there, they’d find the barn doors open. Not even a chain kept them closed.

Then one morning, while my Grandmother was washing dishes she was looking out the window and saw something that made her yell for the kids.

They all ran into the kitchen and my Aunt insists that they saw a headless woman.

She was standing by the old tree stump that was used to cut wood. Aunt Cissy described her as wearing a dress down to her ankles and what looked like a white full body apron. 

One of the brothers opened the backdoor and the headless woman disappeared.

The entire time they lived there, Aunt Cissy said, they heard someone walking up the stairs, opening the attic door and walking around up there. 

My uncles would experience touching and coldness in their room, every night.

My Grandmother didn’t believe them and not even having to close the barn doors every morning, made her start believing that maybe something was going on there.

But the headless woman did it.

She asked the landlord point blank,”What didn’t you tell me about this house?”

The landlord confessed that it did belong to his family for generations but for a few years after the Civil War, it had been used as a convalescence home for wounded soldiers. 

The staff which consisted of two nurses and one doctor lived on the top floor , with the doctor using the attic as his office and living area.

The rest of the residence housed wounded Union soldiers who couldn’t take care of themselves due to missing limbs, or other physical disabilities. The barn had housed more dire patients. Apparently, the doctor considered himself a bit of a therapist and set up living quarters in the barn for mentally unstable soldiers. (IMO: Probably cases of PTSD)

The convalescence home was shut down when one of the “mental patients” took an axe, went on a rampage,  killing some of the soldiers and cutting the head off one of the nurses. 

The landlord told my Grandmother that when his Uncle, who had been born and raised in the house, had died, he had inherited the house. The landlord had tried to rent the home on two separate occasions, telling the tenants that people had heard things in the house and that the barn doors would never stay closed. Both times, the tenants didn’t believe in ghost stories and both times they moved out within a few weeks.

This time when he rented to my Grandmother, he had decided to keep it secret. That plan didn’t really work out for him.

My Grandmother didn’t move though. My Aunt said they stayed there for about 4 years. Eventually, everyone got married and my Grandmother moved into her own apartment.

My Mom never saw any of this but did visit the house a few times and said, yes, the barn doors  were wide open when she got there early one morning. 

I got curious as an adult and tried to look into the history of the house. My Mom told me what street it was on—though for the life of me I can’t remember now. I didn’t find out anything---this was in the dark days BEFORE THE INTERNET! 

Not long after I married, my husband and I were driving around and I realized what street we were on. I got excited because I thought I found the house. It looked like it had new siding and it was no longer on its own piece of land. There were houses built up on either side of it. I did see a barn in the back though. It was chained with a ridiculously large padlock on it. My hubby said we should knock on the door of house but it was 4th of July weekend and people were barbecuing…I didn’t want to intrude. Now I wish I had.

Every day, because I lived in a remote location while I was at school, no bus would come near my home, so I used to get a taxi to school. I used to have regular taxi drivers, and there was one particular taxi driver who was very fond of any real paranormal experiences. she told me of her brother's experience.
______________________

Her brother worked for years in bars around the country, and had heard his share of ghost stories but was rather sceptical himself. He's been brought up in a logical household, to explain everything away with ""reason"". but that soon changed.

He'd just begun working in a new pub called ""the lowther castle"" (it may have just been ""the lowther"" though) in Cumbria, England, near the lake ""ullswater"". He was serving tea to a busy group in the restaurant mid shift.
The way that the pub was laid out, in order to go from the bar to the back rooms where restaurant was, you had to pass through a corridor-like storeroom. 
This night, he was away fetching pots of tea, when suddenly the hotel guests felt the room go cold, and they heard a crash noise from the storeroom. One of the guests investigated the noise, only to find that this young man was unconscious on the floor, with a tray of smashed pots and tea nearby. no doubt he had collapsed. an ambulance was phoned to take him away to hospital. eventually, the same day, he awoke again, but was very distressed. there was nothing medically wrong with him, but he was finding it hard to speak. after a day or two he managed to regain enough composure to speak. He told his sister (the taxi driver) what had happened:  

He was walking through the back room of the pub, when suddenly the air went cold. the room was quite dark, and he put it down to the wind... but then as he was walking through the room, he stopped still as he saw a translucent woman in a flowing blue gown walk out of the door in front of him, and directly through him. The next thing he knew he was in the hospital bed.

What you are about to read is so bizarre that I would not have believed it were it not told to me by two very close friends. What really sold me was that one of them is an avowed skeptic who has trouble buying anything that he cannot understand physically and tangibly. This is **not** a ghost story intended to scare or amaze; this is a legitimate unexplained phenomenon that I am very actively looking to investigate and understand. 

This is not a throwaway account. If you doubt my legitimacy, please scroll back through the pages of my user account. If I did not believe the legitimacy of this story, I would not attach it to my primary reddit account.

**Backstory/Tl;dr for those who did not see my original post**

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/nwfd3/get_back_to_the_road/) is a link to the original.

I'm 17, from Toronto; spent a few days in a small town outside the city to visit three close friends [Allen, Ian and Lewis] over the Christmas break. We love nature, spent lots of time in a large [approx. 10 km²] forest located in the southern part of town. Essentially forms a barrier between Allen and Ian's respective houses. We went for a walk in the woods at night, intense feeling of being watched and reviled, strange moaning sound heard [possible explanations suggested by users in the other thread: deer and other fauna; no sound clips I have heard so far have matched.] The feeling of fear was so intense that it caused us all to leave. 

We aren't skittish people and we often spend a lot of time in the woods after dark, but I and Ian were physically compelled to leave and even Lewis [the skeptic] and Allen followed us without question. None of us have ever heard anything like this, nor have we ever felt at all uncomfortable in the woods after dark-- except for two coyote encounters experienced by Ian and Allen-- which ended fine.

**Recent development:**
I've only got round to explaining this now because I was trying to do research and compile as much information as I could before setting it all together to avoid looking like I was telling tall tales. I think a part of me also didn't really want to pursue this any further as it does creep me out quite a bit. A larger part of me, however, wants to know exactly just what is going on.

Monday, January 16th. Approximately 1:30-2:30 p.m. 
Approximately 18 days after the original occurrence. 

I'm back in Toronto now. I received a text from Ian explaining that he and Lewis had gone into the woods again for what I assume to be the first time since our experience a few weeks before. Ian said that he and Lewis had found a new area of the forest. About half a kilometer away from an open field in which we often build fires, across two little rivers, he and Lewis found another open field. I will describe the field to the best of my memory: according to him there was a central area or depression dug down a little bit; he said it was narrow and oblong and looked about the size and shape of a man if one were to lie down on the ground. He said that the place seemed ""untouched by humans"". They had been feeling fine and got a very warm vibe from the woods that day, as per usual, until they reached this open field. That's when they started to get a bit uncomfortable, like that night over the break. He said that suddenly he and Lewis heard the moaning sound again, and immediately following it, a very sharp and harsh grinding sound. He described it as similar to a steam engine braking, but bassier and sort of crackly-- like a roar. He said it was so loud that he and Lewis were compelled to put their hands over their ears. They began to walk quickly back towards the way they had come, and after jogging for a while began to get closer to the original field with the fire pit. Just as they started to calm down a little, they heard the sound again-- this time louder. In the background Ian said they could hear the sound of trees ""cracking and breaking"" (*note:* I interpreted this sound to be similar to a large animal walking through underbrush, not actual trees splintering in half, but take from it what you will.) At this point both were understandably terrified, and ran as fast as they could through the fire field until they reached a more familiar area and found the main trail that runs through the woods. 

At this point I had only been receiving sloppy text messages sent by Ian, presumably while he was running. Worried, I excused myself from class (I was in school at the time,) and gave Ian a call. He didn't pick up despite the fact that I tried him several times, so I grudgingly returned to class. About 45 minutes later, on the bus home from school, I tried again and Ian picked up. He sounded terrified, and he was stammering quite a bit. He recounted to me exactly what happened, and I could hear Lewis in the background trying to give his two cents as well. I asked Ian to put me on with Lewis who seemed just as confused and upset-- if not more so. This was incredibly significant to me as I have said several times that Lewis does not scare easily, and is very rational and tends to believe only in obvious somatic things. I said I didn't really have any idea what that could have been, and had to hang up as my phone was running out of battery. When I arrived at my s.o.'s house about 15 minutes later, I plugged my phone in. At about 4:00 I got another text from Ian. He and Lewis had gone back into the forest with a camera to attempt to document what they had heard if they were able. They reached the same hidden field, and waited around for a while to see if the noise would happen again. It didn't, so they left.

This event has been a hot topic between us for the past few days, and what I find interesting is the same extreme feeling of unease that preceded both occurrences. Also the fact that they heard the moan before the groaning/grinding sound makes me wonder if they're somehow connected. Yesterday, Ian brought to my attention [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl2Q560V5P0) that Luke found. He and Luke both agreed that this was the **exact** thing that they had heard. Alarmingly, one of the places in which the sound recorded (Windsor, Ontario) is about a four hour drive away from the town in which this occurred. I'd seen these videos before and didn't know what to think about them; I saw the thread discussing them on reddit a few days ago and since I hadn't made the connection I dismissed the sounds as some stupid viral marketing ploy. Now I'm not really sure what to think.
Ian was talking to his mother and apparently a friend of hers used to walk her dogs in the woods often. They recently started to get somewhat skittish, so she stopped taking them. A while after, while on a walk in there, she heard the same sound that Ian and Lewis did and high-tailed it out.

Before somebody suggests it, this was in the heart of the forest and there are no industrial works or steam engines or train tracks or any other conceivable explanation nearby.

I am totally confused and at a loss for an explanation as to what exactly is going on. I hope that I presented this story in a legitimate way and if anybody has any doubts I'll do my best to flesh out the story a little better. If anybody has any similar experiences or possible explanations they'd like to share, please feel free.

**Edit:** Before somebody goes and suggests it, I have no doubt that Ian and Lewis are telling the truth. They're both fairly serious people and not really practical jokers. In addition, hearing the fear in their voices over the phone was quite enough to convince me.

It said ""Observing"" while the EMF behind us was going off. 

The weirdest thing so far is that it said, ""Isn't secret find"" and then the device crashed. Upon reboot there was a cold spot and the device has shut off twice before restarting. I have up and running again but other equipment is starting to freak out.

This is the original post that I saved I can't remember the exact time I posted this but it was at most 2-3 months ago:

""This is a recollection of something I just cannot explain and it terrifies me, also thanks to tortuga_de_la_muerte for telling me make my own post :)

When I was younger I would always find myself waking up early in the morning. Normally you would expect to be greeted by a parent or sibling, this was not the case for me. What I saw was much less welcoming, what I saw wasthe shadow of a man standing right over me. As a young child this terrified me. I would be too scared to move and would lay paralyzed, hiding under my blankets in fear, hoping one of my parents would come and ""wake"" me. This image of a man standing over me greeted me every morning for as long as I can remember sleeping in that room.

Things I can clearly remember involve him changing positions in my room. Sometimes he would be hunched over near the head of my bed, this was his favourite position. Other mornings I would wake up and looking around feeling a sense of relief only to spot him at the end of my bed or crouched over in the corner. I kept writing it off as a trick of the light, but something inside me said otherwise.

I changed my room in our house a few times, but I can't remember anything specific or as vivid as the shadows I saw when I was younger. Around my early teens I finally got my own room, granted it was the smallest room in the house, but it was mine. I completely forgot about the shadow that had haunted me in my first room. However, some nights and mornings I would wake up see something moving out of the corner of my eye. Reminiscent of my childhood, I would always instinctively pull the bed covers over my head and try to fall back asleep.

This time I put it down to just staying up too late, reading scary stories and my mind playing tricks on me. I can't remember any specific encounters with him, but I have woken up a few times to see the outline of something dark hovering over me. The only thing I can confidently say is I have always felt a strong presence of someone constantly watching me. I had completely forgotten about him until very recently.

Last week, while staying at my girlfriends house, this time it wasn't me who woke up in the middle of the night. I woke up to her jabbing me repeatedly whispering to me ""wake up, wake up"". I turned groggily a little annoyed because she never lets me sleep in. Only to have her whisper to me in a terrified voice ""There's a shadow of a man standing over you"". Suddenly all the images of him from my childhood flooded my mind, I did the only thing I could, I pulled the covers over my head. I hope he stops watching me.""

Unfortunately I received some criticism and downvotes for my somewhat sloppy writing skills but these experiences are true. I do not want any criticism but I would like people's thoughts and opinions on the subject. Please any sort of insight would be helpful. Here is an update on what has happened over the last 2 months.

After posting my most recent experience to /nosleep, I had left my ShadowMan be, I did not know what to take from his presence. I did however, reacknowledge his existence in my life. Turns out I was not crazy and this Shadow has been following me throughout my life whether I choose to believe it or not. At first I decided to write off the whole experience however, I felt /nosleep to be an output for my fright and anxiety.

My most recent experience with the ShadowMan was tonight... 08/10/11... this is the European format for you Americans :) (no offense).

It happened at around 8:30pm my girlfriend was curling her hair in the hallway, nerdily enough I was playing Portal 2 that I got on discount recently on Steam for 14:99 (madeoin SteamID: http://steamcommunity.com/id/madeoin ...also the 1v1's are not attributable to SC2 :P) if you guys want to check...

Anyway, we were planning on going out so she was curling her hair, awesome couldn't wait to get absolutely pissed and go out to a club.
Plans were going as expected, could't wait to go out!! Really was looking forward to it all week!! 

Then she calls my name... ""Eoin come here now!""

I replied ""Eh... ok... what's wrong?""

Anyway, playing Portal 2 She appears in my doorway asking me ""Eoin was that you walking passed in the hallway.""

I replied ""UUUUUUUh no......"", laughing thinking that she thought I was doing something else!
This was not the case she was whimpering at me saying that she saw the shadow of a man walk up the hall passed my room.....

I was really freaked out, I asked was it looking at her... she said no.... it was looking at you...

I am genuinely freaked out /nosleep and am happy to answer all of your questions if you can also help answer mine.... What the fuck is following me!!!!

UPDATE:
This is something I posted last night on /nosleep and was suggested to crosspost it here by meglet. I was very tired posting the second part so ignore the crudeness and somewhat pointless aspects of the story... also ignore the more storylike format of the first post I did not realise this kind of subreddit existed.

This is a topic I offer up for discussion as these are both very recent experiences with a shadow person that I now know has been following me for as long as I can remember. 

I will offer to answer all questions. 

I would like to ask for your insights and what I can do to either stop these experiences or contact the shadow, and maybe even your own experiences with shadow people. 

It is now 11:55PM I will do my best to answer all questions in as much detail as possible tomorrow morning!

1317319060.0,17,self.Thetruthishere,kviac,"Morningstar Road Murder (reposted by request, from /nosleep)",,19,2,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kviac/morningstar_road_murder_reposted_by_request_from/,"One late October evening, some high school friends and I are sitting around, drinking, talking about what we want to do for Halloween.  We are discussing haunted houses, parties and other ideas, the usual stuff.  Some promising ideas.  Then, my best friend—the wild man “Alpha” of our group who always pushed our limits of manhood-- becomes suddenly quiet, a small smirk slowly working itself across his face, and he looks to us, engaging each of us in eye contact before proceeding, and says:

“Hey, how about this?  On Halloween, at Midnight, let’s drive out to Morningstar Road and check out the barn where that guy got murdered.  We can bring candles and have a séance…”.  

*My blood slowly ran cold…*

*A few details are needed here for you to truly appreciate his statement.  First, THIS is not a story.  This is Real Life, as accurately as I can remember it, with no embellishment.  Secondly, this was a small Midwestern town, where nothing like murder ever happens.  Third, this was an unusual, and very gruesome, murder.  A man from out of state was found just outside of town in an old abandoned barn, ritualistically murdered.  The body was found bound and gagged, decapitated and, according to the newspaper, “brutally violated”.  Found around the scene were half-melted candles, blood stains, and footprints. Various arcane and satanic symbols were found painted on the ground and walls.  It was rumored that there were additional grisly details the detectives needed to omit, as it was still being investigated.  Finally, Halloween would be the 1-year anniversary, to the day, of when the actual murder was estimated to have taken place.*         

…the hairs stood up on the back of my neck.  As it happens for all of us in these situations, my brain blazed ahead, while the world seemed to slow.  I had an unsettling feeling of wrongness and foreboding, which I would now characterize as “gut instinct”.  Some piece of my still-forming adult judgment was telling me this is just bravado bullshit, fuck it, do not do this.  A thousand thoughts-- the murderers might decide to show up at the same time with another victim-- the police might be staking the place out on that same suspicion and arrest us!  I assess the overall situation, and decide that I’m falling behind in our “ranking” within our pack.  I cannot afford to appear weak now.  I make a snap decision.  Skip to real-time, the body and face under firm control.  My mouth opens, and words pour forth:

“That’s an awesome idea!  Let’s bring candles, and a camera, too.”  I’m committed now.  Oh, god.  For good measure, I add, “Maybe there will even be blood or rope or something still there...”.

The other guys are still quiet, probably doing their own calculating.  My best friend, the alpha, seems taken aback.  He did not expect anyone, myself especially, to take this baiting so readily.  His head bobs, smile widening, and yells, “YEAAAH  AHAHHA!!!” , and claps me on the back of my shoulder.  One of the other guys declines, saying it’s a “stupid way to spend Halloween night”.  Pssht, pussy.  The other guys accept, and I suspect at least one more will not show up.  Becoming aware of myself once again, I quickly half-empty a large glass of Rum and Coke, steeling my nerve and trying to appear enthusiastic at the commitment ahead.

Three days later, on Halloween, two of the other guys manage to ditch, citing plans with a cousin or being grounded.  It’s down to me (the smart kid/class clown), my best friend “Alpha”, and two other guys—an antisocial skater and a goofy bass player.  Somehow, we end up deciding to go during the late afternoon instead of at midnight, so that we can go to a party later (and perhaps unspokenly, so that it’s not dark).

In the late afternoon, we pack up our supplies and pile into my car, an ’83 Grand Prix, and head toward Morningstar road.  I roll down my window, the chill air feeling great, and my cigarette calming me.  The freshly cut soybean rows coruscate on either side of the road, hypnotic, and the sun flashes between the cloud-patched late afternoon sky.  We approach the turn for Morningstar road, a twisty, seldom traveled dirt road interspersed with field and woods.  Curve to the left, then right, then we are plunged into shaded woods.  I slow the car to a crawl, not wanting to miss the unfamiliar turn.  After a few moments, on our right, about 300 feet off the road behind a thick cover of trees, I spot our destination, a dilapidated old barn half-choked with brambles and bushes.  

I turn the car slowly down the old dirt drive, the knee-high weeds making a HSSH-HSSH-HSSH noise under my bumper.  I hoped to not hit any unseen obstacles.  Halfway to the barn, the weeds abated, widening into a clearing.  I decide to park on a flat spot left of the drive about 150 feet away.  The remainder of the drive was brown dust and gravel, leading to a neglected clearing surrounding the barn.  The barn was of average size, very old, not a patch of paint remained on its exterior.  Small, sickly, half-dead trees and bushes surrounded the barn on all sides, to a height of slightly less than the eaves of its roof.  A large, rusted farming implement sat in the tall grass just left of the barn.  On the far right, a small side door faced the drive, its door hanging halfway broken, entrance occluded by a bush, darkness beyond.  

As I parked the car, I think to myself:  Almost one year ago, in this very location, some sick fuck took some poor son of a bitch down this driveway, probably dragged them or marched them at gunpoint, into this barn, and did unspeakably horrible things to them.  Bled them, terrified them.  Likely tortured the shit out of them.  And then murdered them.  This stunt isn’t brave.  It isn’t cool.  *This is foolish.*  *Disrespectful.*  *Wrong.*  Alpha and I exchanged glances, each knowing our role, and silently communicated our need to finish this now-obligation, our solidarity, our doubts, our fears.  

*We are doing this.*  

We opened the car doors. He grabbed the olive drab army surplus bag of supplies.  We let the other two out.  We all stand there for a moment, apparently each taking in the scene.  

“Creepy old piece of shit…”, says Skater.

“Big fucking deal.”, says Goof, as he lights one of his crap-smelling menthols.  No instincts.  Not a brain in his fucking head, I muse to myself.

“Yeah, let’s not start freaking out, this’ll be a cool fucking story at school.”, says Alpha.

The sun was a dull orange, now low in the sky, partially obscured by heavy clouds.  Long shadows played across the surface of the barn and the surrounding woods.   As a group, we stride toward our goal.
We approach the barn, four abreast.  Alpha has a flashlight ready in hand.  I am squeezing my car keys in my fist, wishing I’d brought my machete or a combat knife.  We get closer.  A hundred feet.  Fifty feet.  Ten.  The barn is leaning slightly.  I can see into the interior.  There appears to be a wooden door lying in the dirt inside the barn.  Some unidentifiable junk, maybe a saw or a broken board.  There are some very old beer cans littering the ground, a couple of discarded pull tabs.  Footprints.  Long shadows, nearly twilight now.  The barn is—

I feel *something.*  My heart nearly stops—

A flurry of activity, I am not aware of what’s going on, can’t speak, I don’t know—

I’m ten feet away.  Alpha and Goof are in further in front of me, near the doorway.  Alpha backs up FAST.  Goof says something low and questioning.

*&gt;Jump forward in time&gt;—*

Alpha grabs me, HARD, yells something, facial expression indescribable, scruffs my coat, whips me around.  Goof runs past us like he’s insane.  I return to the world.  Cold adrenaline hits me, but I don’t move.  Someone screams.  Is screaming AT ME.  What?—

I turn back around, look up, still in a stupor, eyes drawn to the barn’s roof.  As my eyes scan up, something slides DOWN.  A...moving shadow.  It slides off the roof, down the side of the barn as though falling.  It loudly rustles the bushes, as though a large object had fallen off the roof—SwishswishTHUMP!  I still have no idea what I am seeing.  I’m paralyzed, or my attention is completely rapt, no idea how to describe it.  Fear slowly registering now, much too slowly.  A shadow rises, semi-translucent, eight feet tall, hunched, impossibly long-limbed, bipedal.  Glowing, dark red pinpoint eyes.  It slowly lopes along the side of the barn, no noise now, nothing rustling.  Heading down the side of the barn, left to right, towards the doorway, towards me...

Another hard jerk, someone yells and I am running, screaming, back toward the car.  Skater is jerking on the passenger door, Goof is saying something to me.  I pat my pockets—

I recall a “jingle” during my run.  Goddamn.

“Droppedthekeys!  HEREHELPMELOOKwhere--!!”, I yell.  A few precious seconds, ten feet back, gleaming in the dirt.  

Grabbed the keys.  Unlock door, reach over and unlock the other.  Start the car.  Tear out of there like the Indy500, car bouncing crazily, I hit a log or something, keep going.  Tires squealing, huge plume of dust in my rearview, tearing down the road, fast.  Count of ten, normalcy returning, becoming aware of a cold sweat making my shirt stick to my back.  Panic.  Heart hammering out of my chest, pounding in my neck.  I’m laughing hysterically.  Someone is babbling fuck NO fuck no fucking way NO WAY. Make eye contact with Alpha.  His face matching my own.  Disbelief.

Skater and Goof leave.  I don’t sleep that night, no party, no haunted houses.  Alpha and I talk all night.  We recount the experience, our stories nearly identical.  From his perspective, as we approached the barn, I stopped in my tracks.  He assumed I was lighting a cigarette or stalling, but chose not to shame me.  He continues on closer, then backs up after hearing a low, menacing growl, thinking it was an animal.  I heard nothing.  As he backed away, the same strange feeling hit him.  When he grabbed my collar and yelled at me, I was insensate, dumbfounded, in some sort of trance.  

**He saw the shadow, watched it hit the bushes, then ran nearly halfway back to the car when he noticed I was still standing there.  He made himself come back for me.  As he reached me, he claimed it was not on the barn as I perceived, but in the grass, coming towards me.  He saw the shadow.  The eyes…**

And that, dear reader, is a true friend.  If he hadn’t come back for me, what would have happened?    

Since then, I have felt that same “feeling” perhaps two or three times in my life.  When I have gotten that feeling in any situation, I immediately drop what I am doing and leave.  


**Bonus Note:  As I said, this is not fiction.  The above is my memory of what actually happened.  Doubt me if you will, but it is part of my reality, and I am considered by most accounts to be a very rational, logical, science-minded individual.  Some of the details online concerning the actual murder are wrong.  They’re not consistent between sources.  For details of the actual murder story, search keywords, “William Anthony Ault”(RIP), “Jimmie Lee Penick” “murder”.  I’m pretty jaded, but it is *absolutely gruesome.*  **I would NOT read this late at night…NSFL.**  And don’t bother looking for the barn, it’s been destroyed.  Road is still creepy, though…

They rented it and used it as a living/work space for artists and musicians so there were always people coming through. It had been a police station and a nursing home in the past. The kitchen was actually where the 'hole' or solitary confinement cell in the station would have been. The pic and plans of the house linked above show all the bedrooms where the elderly residents would have lived.

The building had a weird feeling about it but none of the permanent residents would admit this. One night I slept there I woke at about half three. I tried to get back to sleep, but had this horrible feeling of being watched/sexually threatened and ended up having a fucking horrible semi-lucid dream. I got up, absolutely terrified at four thirty and drove home. 

Eventually towards the end of the time the guys lived there I had become pretty friendly with Mick and after telling him about my shitty nights sleep he opened up a bit about the goings on at the house.

If you look at the plan, the room I slept in is the fourth on the left. This is the room the 'rapist' ghost (this is what the people in the house called it) liked. People who slept in this room often woke with the feeling of having been sexually molested. 

One of the artists who lived there for a couple of months slept there all the time. As she was trying to sleep one night she felt hands at the bottom of the bed. They slid over her feet onto her legs, then further up onto her stomach. She felt hands glide along her body and then the weight of a man press down on her. She even felt breath on her face. She was so frightened she passed out. 

Another guy who lived there at the time was a singer/songwriter. He was practicing one day in his room when from just behind his right ear he heard ""SHUT UP"".

He also claimed to have walked into the living room (the large room below the sex pest bedroom) to see about 10 people all sitting around. When he blinked they disappeared. There was a piano in this room that would play by 'itself' too.

Along with various other weirdness, like little kids seeing 'men' that nobody else saw; one of the things that stands out for me was being there with an ex-sinn fein, then anarchist, no bullshit, rugged, manly man type. We were in living room having beers and chatting and he went down the hall, past the room, to the toilet. When he came back he immediately and directly asked Mick if the place was haunted. He never said what he saw or did not see, but he knew.

  Let me set the stage.  I lost my sister to breast cancer two days before her 31st birthday (January 2, 2009).   My oldest son was 8 months old when she passed.   She was my sons god-mother and he kept her strong and fighting to the very end.  He took his first steps in Hospice while she was there.  Needless to say, she loved him more than anything.
  This incident happened a couple of days after my sons first birthday (April 2009).  Like a lot of kids, he received a Mylar ""Happy Birthday"" balloon.  It had been a couple of days and the balloon had lost some helium and was kind of in the hover phase...enough helium to keep the balloon about a foot off the ceiling, but not fall to the floor.
  Our house at the time was a two story cape cod built in 1938 and moved from its original lot in the '60's to where it was when we bought it.  When you walk in the front door there was a little foyer, which then open up to our living room through an arched entry.  Straight ahead was another arched doorway which led to a small hallway.   To the right, a bedroom...to left the kitchen and the stairs to the second floor.  Our master bedroom, our sons room and a bathroom were on the second floor.  
  So, the night of the incident, we noticed the balloon was in the foyer by the front door before we went to bed.  We had our ceiling fan on and an industrial fan at the foot of our bed blowing out our door (need the noise to sleep and kept the air upstairs circulated).  My wife startled awake by the ballon hitting the ceiling fan and woke me up.  Just as I was waking up the balloon settled right between us.   It didn't land on the bed, it just kind of hovered a foot above the bed right between us.  It was a little creepy, but we were both tired so we pushed the balloon away and fell asleep.  When we woke up the next morning the balloon was on the floor in our sons room.
  I know this story doesn't sound very creepy, but when we thought about it, we couldn't figure out how a balloon that was almost out of helium, traveled from our foyer by the front door to our room upstairs and finally come to rest in our bathroom.  It would have had to drop under two doorways (about 20ft from front door to the small hallway), make a 90 degree left turn and go about 5ft to the stairway.   It would then have to make 90 degree right turn and go up about 12 flights of stairs to a landing and another 3 steps to our main level upstairs.  Then somehow, it was able to make it into our room against the force of an industrial fan on high blowing out the door.  To us, the physics of the whole situation didn't make sense.  Since that day, we have chalked it up to my sister saying she was there and saying happy birthday to her god-son.  Sorry to ramble...I'm not the writer in the family, my sister was.

TLDR: Mylar ballon that didn't have much helium went from our foyer by our front door to our master bedroom and came to rest in our sons room.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1iowkv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1iowkv/creepy_mylar_balloon_me/,
1369281151.0,15,self.Thetruthishere,1evt0c,[ME][FR] [UPDATE] Collective dream house,Agent_Nycto,21,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1evt0c/mefr_update_collective_dream_house/,"[first post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1dlvmt/mefr_collective_dream_house/)

In my last post, I mentioned that some friends an I had all drempt of the same house, with alarming detail. I would first like to say that I am sorry that I didn't post many details about it, on the off chance that someone else reading this has been there as well. This was mostly to preserve the accuracy of what I, or someone else, was remembering. 

Recent events have changed my position on this, and I want to start collecting and verifying as much data as possible. 

I had the chance encounter to see lots of people I knew, including the two aforementioned friends, at an event that we were all going to. By chance the topic turned to this manor house. 

Another friend of mine had been there. She described things in elaborate detail, just as my other friends had.

Not only that, but apparently there were more places to explore. Different areas, related to this manor area. Places like a volcano, an ocean, a jungle, and a desert. 

The desert was of particular interest, because this was another place that I had somehow ended up at. I didn't mention it to my other friends because I hadn't experienced other people who had been there before. In the desert, there was a bustling city inside of it, between two cliffsides, in a valley. The buildings were carved out of stone, much like desert dwelling Native Americans. The unique trait about this city was that everything, literally, was a shop, even the homes. You could wander everywhere, and everyone was trying to sell something to you. 

One of the common traits was that the different realms had different rules, and your appearance/abilities changed depending on the area. In The Jungle, for example, my friends who had been tehre described that they radically changed, and became more animal like. One changed into some creature that could navigate through the trees easily, another changed into something that could travel through the underbrush. 

In the realms it seemed that there were local people that lived there. The Jungle had more aboriginal residents. The Manor had dusty, Victorian looking people in it, specifically two children who tended to act as guides. 

Some areas had some sort of large, powerful entity, who seem to be temperamental in whom they will like in their realm or not. One liked one friend, another did not. 

One of the unifying feelings that everyone got when they were there was this sense that it was very, very real, and definitely not like a normal dream. Some of my friends have practiced doing things in waking dreams, and they said that this acted totally different. They could not do whatever they wanted or change what was happening. 

Also, everyone seems to have a particular ""spawn point"". One friend would always start off in a well kept, grassy area, similar to a golf course. Another would start off in a dilapidated house that was near The Manor. 

The friend whom I had not talked to about this beforehand also said that she had made several maps of the areas. When she described how to get from one realm to another, my other friends confirmed that it happened the same way in their dreams. 

She also mentioned that she figured out how to get there, on a semi regular basis. 

I'm going to try to get back there. For some reason, I think I am looking for something that I lost. Every time that I have had this dream, I have been looking for something, whether in The Market or in The Manor. 

If anyone has had similar experiences, or if this sounds familiar, I would really appreciate your input. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1evt0c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1evt0c/mefr_update_collective_dream_house/,

So my friend Nash and I both started having these really weird dreams where we would see this ""being"" that looked like a man almost but there was just something really off about him that didn't seem human-like at all. Before telling each other what 'he' looked like we both did kinda shitty drawings of what we had seen in our dreams and then compared them. This is where I started to get really creeped out.

  We both had drawn this really thin faced pale man with black eyes and long stringy black hair and then when we talked about it we both would see him in the dreams were he sort of just ascended from the shadows and would watch us from the edge of the darkness. He never said a single word to either of us it was just a dream of him watching us moving around the edge of the darkness. 

   For me personally it never moved past dreams except on occasion I'd feel really uncomfortable like someone was watching me and then Nash told me he started to see the 'man' in real life and that one night when we were texting he walked to the kitchen and glimpsed him standing outside his sliding glass door in the room next to the kitchen. He said it happened a couple times where at night he'd see him standing outside his house. I honestly don't know all the details of those times though because we just kind of dropped the subject because we were both so freaked out by it. We ended up calling 'him' Umbra I honestly don't even remember why. 

   So to this day it drives me crazy wondering what the hell this thing was and was there maybe some way we were just sharing some crazy dream that turned into a hallucination for him? I really am just so bothered and confused by it.   ",,False,,t5_2sntx,1367541466.0,,,True,t3_1djb72,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1djb72/a_man_we_called_umbra/,
1367379151.0,16,self.Thetruthishere,1dgkx8,[ME] The Missing Wallet,rapierspoint,20,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1dgkx8/me_the_missing_wallet/,"Hey everyone! So glad to see that this subreddit exists, as much as I do enjoy r/nosleep. I'll tell you the weird story that happened, exactly as I tell it, this January to me and two of my most skeptical atheist friends.

Full disclosure, this is copied and pasted from my personal blog, so it's in a little bit of a ""for an audience"" format, but I swear that this is not fiction and I'm completely open to explanations. 

""John"" and ""Charlotte"" (two of my bestest buds who happen to date each other) came over and the three of us got sushi at a restaurant around the corner from my apartment.

Our waitress was not the brightest bulb in the tool box, or whatever the saying is. She had trouble understanding what we wanted when we said the exact words that were on the menu. It wasn’t a language barrier; she was just not too quick on the uptake. It also took us about half an hour to get our check, in a restaurant with eight tables that’s the size of about my living room. John was not pleased, and our tips reflected our feelings about the service. (Note: We did tip her. She’s fine. She can still pay for rent.)

We left to go to Walgreens in the hopes of finding some sparkling apple cider. I had told them that it was fine for them to drink even if I was going to abstain, but as good friends, they said they didn’t need to. John lit a cigarette, and we started to walk past this restored Victorian house that we’d been speculating about from the restaurant. It looks like the gingerbread house from Hansel and Gretel, and we had joked about who would get the tower room if we all lived in it like a giant fairy-tale family.

From behind John, all of a sudden, we hear a woman’s voice say, “Excuse me?” Now, John is a tall dude. I couldn’t see who was behind him, and we were only about 100 feet from the restaurant, so my immediate thought was that it was our waitress about to yell at him for his tip. It turned out to be a different woman.

“Sorry to bother you, but can I buy a cigarette off of you?”

I started laughing (partly from relief), and John happily gave her a cigarette in exchange for a dollar. She asked to use his lighter, and he handed it to her. We were walking away when she came back, apologetic, saying that the lighter hadn’t worked, and John bent down to light her cigarette. And on we continued to Walgreens.

They didn’t have sparkling cider. They did have flu shots, so at 9pm on a Friday, my super-cool friends got injected with influenza vaccines. We picked up some Diet Coke and John went to pay for it. He reached into his pants pocket, and then drew out his hand, puzzled. He tried his other pocket.

“Hold on, I must have put my wallet somewhere,” he said. Earlier, he’d been showing off his new, compact wallet–no folds, just slots for cards on either side of a small leather rectangle. He reached into his coat pockets, outer and inner, convinced that he’d slipped it in there somewhere, or that it had slipped into the lining of his coat from a pocket since it was so little.

John didn’t find it in his coat, so he started to look into his bag. Now, I love this man dearly, but he does tend to misplace things, especially car keys, so I wasn’t too concerned. We’d come a total of three blocks from where he’d last used his wallet, so I figured that even if he couldn’t find it on his person, it couldn’t have gone far. John dug through his bag, getting more flustered, and I offered to buy the soda so that he could go check the pharmacy area.

Pharmacy was a bust. He’d checked his bag and all pockets several times. We concluded that he must have left it at the restaurant, so he called them up as we began to walk back over. As luck would have it, he got the same waitress on the phone, and even with descriptions of us and of the table we’d been sitting at, she didn’t know what was going on. Finally John just said, “You know, it’s fine, we’re actually almost there, I’ll just come look.” Meanwhile, Charlotte and I scanned the ground for a dropped wallet.

We didn’t see anything, so when we got to the restaurant, John went over with a different waiter to the table we’d been at and politely asked the current diners if he could look under the table. They got up and helped him look. The waitress we had undertipped was acting as hostess, so Charlotte and I stood at the front in, as you can imagine, no awkwardness at all. John returned, shaking his head. Nothing. The waitress/hostess looked completely blank when we asked if it could have been on a plate that got carried off or stuck in the check billfold. It was the other waiter who answered that they unfold the check carriers immediately and that they would have found anything inside.

John was bummed. Luckily for him, there hadn’t been any cash in the wallet, but his work ID card was in there, along with his debit and credit cards, and he wasn’t looking forward to canceling and replacing all of them. Trying to cheer him up with dark humor, Charlotte and I started to speculate about whether or not the seemingly-dumb waitress were actually a master thief, or if the woman who’d asked for a cigarette had been a pickpocket. We didn’t seriously think she had been; John and she had never actually gotten too physically close, and his peacoat had been covering his pants pockets, where he’d remembered putting the wallet.

Char and I began to walk faster than John, eager to get back to my apartment so we could conduct a thorough search of John’s bag and coat. We were both fairly confident that doing so would make this wallet turn up. John lagged behind, in front of the fairy tale house where we’d met the desperate smoker, and as he told us later, his only thought was a prayer (an atheist’s prayer) to find this wallet.

Then, from behind us, Charlotte and I heard John shout, “GUYS!”

We turned around, and he was holding his wallet out like it was the torch from the Statue of Liberty.

I jogged back to him. “Awesome! Where did you find it?”

As I approached John, I realized that he had the most shocked look on his face that I have ever seen there. I’ve known this guy for seven years. He is one of the people closest to me in the world. I have never seen confident John so shaken.

“It hit my leg,” he said.

“…okay,” I said. “So it slipped out of your pocket and tapped you behind the knee?”

He was shaking his head. “No, it hit me in the leg like it had been thrown. Like a Frisbee,” he said. “It hit me so hard that it bounced to like three feet away.”

We looked around. There was no one anywhere near us. You could easily see around the corner–no one there. No one had been there. There aren’t a lot of people hanging out on my street at 9:15pm on a Friday. The house had some little bushes, but at this point in the season you could see right through them. The open grounds in front of the house were empty. We were at least a half a block away from the restaurant, and no one had opened their door.

“Right,” I said. I proceeded to essentially frisk him. I was pretty sure that this wallet had just been in one of his pockets and that his pocket had a hole in it, and the wallet had hit him at a weird angle.

One pocket, and only one, had a hole in it. It was the coat pocket on the right side. John had been hit in the left leg, and although the pocket of his coat had a hole, the lining did not. Meaning that even if the wallet had slipped into that hole (which was not big enough for it anyway), it would have remained trapped in the lining of his coat. His bag was securely sealed with no holes in it.

This is where both my face and Charlotte’s started to look a lot like John’s.

Somehow, my friend’s missing wallet hit him in the back of the leg, as hard as if it had been thrown, a substantial distance away from any other people and with very few plausible explanations accounting for it having fallen off his person.

In front of a witch’s fairy-tale house by which we had done a mysterious stranger a favor.

We high-tailed it home, John saying, despite his prayers, “Well, I still don’t believe in God.”

***
We went home and Googled Angelology for laughs, but my favorite was Charlotte's theory that we entered into a realm of weird fairy tale logic. Her theory goes: John had already lost his wallet by the time we passed the old house to begin with. The woman who asked for the cigarette was actually a spirit or some shiz and asked for three favors (to buy the cigarette, to borrow the lighter, and to get an additional light). By fulfilling these, John won himself a boon. When he walked by the same place again, thinking madly that all he wanted was his wallet, she delivered--by chucking his wallet at him.

Obviously she's not serious with that, and I'm sure something explainable happened but we had such a collective WTF moment that we were giddy the rest of the night.

I've also had sleep paralysis a couple of times in the apartment around the corner, which maybe I'll post about sometime. Until I had it, I don't think I realized how vivid and real that can feel. I'm really glad I knew what sleep paralysis was at the time or else I would not have been able to get back to sleep (as it was, my friends made me bless my apartment with sage, which at least got it smelling nice).

On the side of the building at which I worked, there was a long winding staircase that nobody ever bothered to use due to the four elevators located right across from each stairway entrance. One day when leaving to go on my lunch break, I was walking down the hall toward the elevator and I saw a man very hastily walking out of the stairwell area and into a small alcove next to where the elevators were. I thought maybe he was trying to get a better phone signal or something, because that is where I usually go when making  phone call due to the large window there. The man was wearing a business suit and had short, slicked back hair that appeared either brown or dirty blond. He had a briefcase. The way he moved, he appeared almost as a blur, and I don't remember his facial features too well, save his somewhat pointy nose. 

I arrive at the elevator, press the call button, and begin to wait. The area is very silent, and I try to peak over to see what this man in the suit is doing. To my surprise, he was not there. I walk over and inspect the alcove. I have included several pictures of this area, but let me just say that the only things here of notoriety are the janitor's closet, which appeared to be locked, and the large window, only lightly cracked open. I am sure scarier stuff than this happens in your city halls, but this was the only strange experience I had ever had working there.

[Picture 1](http://i.imgur.com/4NiJyBf.jpg) This first picture shows the general smallness of the alcove. The wall of the left is the elevator. The big thing on the right is the window. The ladder was not there the day of the disappearance (this picture was taken several days later).

[Picture 2](http://i.imgur.com/tRUwNO0.jpg) This is a head-on picture of the alcove. As I said, the ladders were not here when the man disappeared. The alcove is relatively small but good for acquiring a phone signal due to the window.

At least I had two witnesses. 
 
The event happened between 2005-2006.  My father had come to pick me and my sister up and take us to visit him in Childress, TX (my brother couldn't make it that weekend).  It was late and the drive from Lubbock isn't exactly quick. 
 
We ended up taking the backroad between Matador and Childress, leaving hwy 62/70 and skipping Paducah all together.  It was near dark when we were on a particularly winding section of the little two lane road my father had chosen. 
 
Off to my right, I saw a farm-type building, almost barn-like.  In the accompanying field I saw something that I could not place.  While I may live in the city, I am by no means a stereotypical ""city boy"".  I am familiar with a good deal of livestock and farming equipment.  This was something new.  Still, given that I am admittedly no expert in the field, I simply assumed that this was some newfangled contraption.   
 
I didn't see it for very long, no more than a glimpse really.  The reason I don't describe the object I saw then is because I truly don't recall it.  I do remember seeing *something* that struck me as odd and out of place.  
 
We winded down and I lost sight of the field and the mystery object.  It was the perfect twilight time in which I first saw the object, because as the road rolled forward and the field came back into view, the sun had set and it was dark.  It was then that I caught sight of the object again, but I can assure you all that what I saw then was nothing like I saw the first time around. 
 
There were lights in the field, all over it.  My first thought was ""where the hell did that thing go"", the second being, ""well, maybe that is the source of the lights.""  I was content to let it go, but the lights began to hover before I could turn away.  I watched in awe as we motored down the road, briefly stunned to silence.  As the lights hovered further off the ground, I came to my senses. 
 
I shouted ""Dad, dad!"" and started throwing my left arm into his right to get his attention, never taking my eyes off of the spectacle before me.   
 
When he responded, perturbed about the method in which I had garnered his attention, I just pointed out my side of the windshield.  His awe-inspired mutterings of ""what the hell?"" stick with me today. 
 
We both stared at the object as it rose further into view.  My father did not have to worry about splitting his attention between the road and the object long, as it quickly rotated out in front of us.  I had the distinct impression that we were looking at the back of the object. 
 
It was hovering just out of the reach of our headlights (I think), because there was no form, no reflection off of whatever material held the craft together.  If not for the lights on the craft itself, we never would have known it was there.  And there it was.   
 
The light-outlined thing filled our windshield.  Given the size of the field I had seen it in, I can only guess that the ""wingspan"", if indeed that is the correct terminology in this instance, was easily 200 yards across.  The thing was massive.  Despite its incredible bulk, the craft was agile, for as we drove, the craft (or its pilots) proved to be aware of us as they stayed directly in front of us, matching our speed (roughly 60 mph) and turned with us at every twist and bend of the road.   
 
As this went on for what felt like a few minutes (I did not have the foresight to check my watch, as I could not tear my eyes away from the object, but I do believe minutes to be accurate), it abruptly took off.  In the literal blink of an eye, the craft was dozens of miles away, if not more.   
 
For those of you unfamiliar with the Texas skyline, it stretches unimpeded for great distances.  The craft, with its distinct lighting, went from filling our windshield view to being only a hand span in the distance.  As I watched, the thing was gone entirely in seconds. 
 
I cannot accurately fathom the speed at which the craft had to accelerate, or what could possibly protect the pilots from the forces of nature pulling back at them.  The most disturbing aspect of the encounter was that the craft made no sound, not even when it was moving faster than the speed of sound.  No sonic boom; nothing. 
 
If not for the presence of my little sister (aged roughly 6-7 at the time), we would have turned around and gone back to the farm of origin and investigate.   
 
My father and I talk about it occasionally and lament my lack of recording device at the time (I have had a camera phone for that very reason ever since).  My sister doesn't remember much about the ordeal, other than that we were very excited at the time. 
 
My father has pointed out that Sheppard Air Force base isn't too far (well, for Texans, anyway) from Matador and that was the direction the craft took off in.  I can easily see some pilot spotting our car and saying, ""hey, let's scare the piss out of some farmer"".  When I told the story to an acquaintance in Army intelligence, he wouldn't say anything other than ""we have shit even you wouldn't believe"".  Take it for what it's worth. 
 
So, anybody else ever deal with anything similar, especially in that area?  I'm dying to know!

1361317497.0,17,self.Thetruthishere,18umox,My chat with my cousin who passed away in 2007,Skooter_McGaven,23,6,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18umox/my_chat_with_my_cousin_who_passed_away_in_2007/,"This is a x/post from r/nosleep. A another redditor suggested I post this here. 

My cousin lived out in Missouri with her brother, mom, and dad (my cousin aunt and uncle obviously). They had moved out there in the early 2000s from New Jersey where I and most of my family lives.
In 2007 she was killed in a car accident. She was the passenger in her boyfriends car and he was driving like an asshole. He ended up being fine but she got hit on her door and passed away at the hospital a couple hours later. Needless to say, it devastated our family. Its a horrible night I will never forget.

It really destroyed me on the inside. All of my Aunts ( we have a big family) on my moms side, and my mom are pretty religous. Not in the sense of pushing their viewpoints or anything like that but they go to church when they can and pray a lot when someone is sick or needs help ect.

I grew up catholic and never really questioned it. I wasn't really religious but I didn't really refute it. When my cousin passed away I stopped believing in any of it because I felt she was stolen from our lives and if there was a god then why would he ever do something like that to us.

In May of 2011 I asked my long time girlfriend to marry me. When we got engaged my fiance's dream was to get married in the church that she went to her whole life. We both went to the nearby catholic school (different grades) and she loved that church. She is not very religious but does believe in God. I told her that I did not want to get married in church because I no longer believed in it and was kind of angry at the whole thought. I figured if there is a god, I hate him, if not then why get married in this false place. I was pretty set on this and she understood but still held out hope.

A little side track backstory. As I said my aunt is pretty religious. She is probably the most religious out of our family even after losing her daughter. So one day, a couple weeks after she passed, she was walking with my uncle on their property and she asked my cousin to show them a sign that she was with them. As they were walking along they noticed a yellow butterfly by them. It continued to follow them for an odd amount of time and they went on a very long walk. Since that time a yellow butterfly is our families symbol for our cousin, my aunt and other cousin even got a tattoo of it. Everytime we see a yellow butterfly it makes our family a little at peace.

Fast forward a couple a months:
I am lying in my bed trying to sleep and I start to get this weird feeling. Something was not right, I know I was wide awake so it wasn't a dream. I have had a couple of encounters with what I believe to be ghosts but this was different. I started to hear something, but only in my head. I know that sounds like I'm just talking to myself in my head but it was different. I also started to see something bright but it wasn't in front of me it was in my head, I can't really explain it past that. My eyes were wide open and it was just there. The voice started to tell me that it was my cousin. She told me three things:
That I had to get married in a church. She told me the only way she would be able to see me get married was if I got married in a church.
She told me to draw my aunt a picture (I draw as a hobby). In my head I vividly saw the picture to draw.

She simply told me '69'. The immature kid in me giggled a little bit but she told me that it would make sense and verify that I was really talking to her. She said the number represented something big and I would understand. That part of the message was told over and over again to me.

Needless to say this shook me up when it ended. I couldn't stop crying that night. It just brought back a lot of pain and I honestly chalked it up to just myself making it up but I wasn't convinced of that either.
This bothered me for quite awhile. I searched through the articles of the car accident searching for some representation of 69. I looked at her name, our family history, anything and everything. It killed me I could not find anything that stood out and slapped me in the face.
Eventually I gave up but I told my mom about what happened. A couple days later she wrote me a letter explaining how my aunt and uncle went on their walk...and at the end of it she wrote y-e-l-l-o-w (6) b-u-t-t-e-r-f-l-y (9)....

After that it pretty much verified to me that I did actually talk to her. I eventually did get married in a church and drew my aunt the picture. I am not any more religious but I am glad I got married in the church. I don't know if God exists or heaven or any of that stuff but no one will ever convince me I didn't talk to my cousin.

After my mom discovered what it meant I told my fiance and she told me about a dream she had a week before I was visited. Mind you that she never met my cousin but did see pictures. She told me she had very simple dream with my cousin it telling her everything was going to work out and not to worry about the church. She didn't tell me about it before because she didn't want to upset me. Needless to say i know who I talked to that night.

 At this time, we were about half way up the mountain. Rather than backtrack down the track, we decided we'd just turn off the track and go 'bush wacking' until we found the track again further down the mountain. After doing this for about 15 minutes, we found some particularly thick poison ivy. After a bit of hack and slas, we found that a large tree branch had fallen in the middle of the ivy recently, so we could make it through the ivy without the hack and slash if we walked over it. 

So there we were, trying to walk over it. 2 of my friends were in front of me, one behind. We all heard some movement a short distance behind us. I turned around fastest (i have pretty quick reactions), and saw what appeared to be a person, running. The thing is though, it was completely black and had no shadow. It was basically a living shadow. i only saw it for maybe 2 seconds before it was gone, running away into the bush. Although i remember it all really clearly. I think time must have slowed as the adrenaline kicked in. I asked my friend behind me if he had seen it. He looked scared and worried and said no. I asked my friend directly in front of me. He too, had seen nothing. I wanted to run after it and see where it went, but my friends were keen at this stage to continue on home, at a faster pace.

These are true, certainly mine are and my family don't tend to exaggerate heavily or lie so I believe their stories as well.

Anyway, enjoy (:


**Mine**

**Sleep paralysis**

When I was about 10 I used to have an animal visit me when I slept at my fathers house. While I was drifting off I would hear the jingling of a collar and then something would jump onto my bed about the size and weight of a small to medium dog. When I would try to open my eyes I would find that I couldn't, when I got close to being able to the animal would simply get up and trot out of the room and as soon as it was over the threshold I could open them. This happened to me on numerous occasions when I was feeling unhappy or uncomfortable, including once at a friends house. I experienced this once again in my adult life when my cat Romie had stayed out for the night and I became lucid in the middle of the night. I was patting an animal, feeling really calm and thought to myself 'why was I ever so scared of this?' I posted a longer detailed account of this in *nosleep*, should have put it in here but I didn't realise this forum existed till the other day.

Interestingly to anyone who happened to read that post I remembered while talking to my boyfriend the other day that I used to see dogs walking up to me out of the corner of my eye during a stage in my life where I was grieving for my grandmother. I even went to shoo one out of the cafe I worked in only to realise there wasn't a dog there after all.


**Float**

I used to live in a terrace house in Northcote, Victoria when I was 12. Two things happened here, the first time I was standing in my bedroom cleaning up my room being a messy child. I was folding a load of clean clothes and putting them on top of my chest of drawers while listening to music. While folding a jumper I saw something strange out of the corner of my eye, it looked like the pile of clothes I was folding were floating just off the edge of my drawers. When I turned around they fell to the floor. Nothing like this happened again.


**kittens**

In the same house we had a toy cat named Puddin'. She was tiny, basically forever a kitten. For some reason, I don't know why because we've always been responsible pet owners, she wasn't spayed. There was a crazy cat lady a couple of doors down that had multitudes of ferals and Puddin' unfortunately ended up pregnant. Anyway, the night came where she was birthing so we set up a bed for her in the bathroom and let nature take its course. Being a kid I was really excited, kittens! And mini kittens if Puddin' was anything to go by at that! I sat up really late reading in my room. Our house used to have an outhouse and when they renovated they put down flooring and extended a hallway out to the bathroom so there was a window in my room that looked into here. At around 2-3am I got really weirdly creeped out and looked dubiously at this window, I saw a black hooded shadow slip past made up of a kind of solid smoke. I sat frozen barely breathing for a long while after but it never walked back the other way and I didn't hear anything after that. In the morning we went to check on my cat and her kittens and found the babies were all still born. Puddin' was fine. 


**Grandma**

I was working in an icecream parlour at the time I was grieving for my grandmother. I was standing in the corner of the shop staring off into space thinking about her and feeling deeply disturbed when a smell caught my attention. It was her perfume she used to always get from Avon. No customers were in the store and the kitchen staff didn't wear perfume to work as it was against the rules so I wonder if it was her trying to comfort me as I always used to watch her put it on when I was 6 and then she'd give me a little squirt on my wrists and show me how to dab it on your pulse points. I loved that woman.


**Bulk**

I live with my boyfriend now in the suburbs in Victoria. His house has a history of little incidents which I'll post with his families experiences. I woke up in the middle of the night really groggy. I was flitting between awake and asleep and I put my hand on his side and was patting him. My partner is pretty lean and light on muscle bulk but as I was patting him it was like someone else was laying in the bed with me. The person I had my arm around had built up muscles and was much broader than my boyfriend. I was super lethargic but I batted it off and half sat up calling his name concerned, as soon as he turned his head and replied he felt like himself again so I laid back down and went to sleep. As I heard his breathing get heavier though his form began to feel bulkier and alien again. I just went to sleep to be honest, I was really tired. I think this creeped him out the next morning than me. I remember feeling like sadness was filling the room when it happened.


**Shadow**

A couple of months ago my partner and I were bedding down. I turned the light off so he could go to sleep and began my nightly ritual of playing on my iphone until I get drowsy. By the time I was locking my phone my boyfriend was asleep. I closed my eyes for a minute and after a moment got really anxious. I opened my eyes and in the corner of our room, up against the curtains and our desk was a dark shadow. Our curtains are block out blinds so it's pretty dark but there's a little light and I know all the shapes in our room. Whatever it was was big as a great dane and more animal than human. It was just sitting there looking at me (though I couldn't see it's eyes but it's body was facing me.) and when I called out for my partner it didn't leave. My boyfriend asked me what was wrong but I didn't want to scare him so I just said I was frightened then I pulled the blankets over my head and went to sleep.

One night in 1989 my dad decided to call it a night and head to the bedroom for a good nights sleep. Little did he know about the traumatic experience which he would remember for the rest of his life.

He was sleeping on his back with his arms folded on top of his chest and there was a shelf attached to a wall directly above his head. For some reason, one which he still doesn't know the answer to, he just woke up and felt a sense of fear. He didn't know why, although he said that it felt like somebody was watching him. Eventually, he opened his eyes, and that's when he saw it. There was a pale white being's face looking directly at him. He told me that the only way he could describe it was like a typical [alien grey](http://www.unidentified-flying-objects.net/grey-alien-photo.gif.) It had big, black eyes and an almost undefinable nose.

The reason why I previously explained that there was a shelf attached to a wall behind him was because it would make it physically impossible for this being to be leaning over him. If this thing wasn't a figment of his imagination then how could it be standing inside of a wall?

Anyway, he couldn't move. He was paralysed and all he was capable of was staring into the being's big, black eyes. At the time he didn't know much about sleep paralysis and this was his first experience in regards to it. He would close his eyes for a few seconds and open them again, still seeing this pale face standing over him. His heart was racing and he didn't know what to do. He was helpless.

After a few heart pounding minutes he managed to find the ability to move one of his toes. He began to wriggle it as much as he could and closed his eyes again, hoping that the thing would eventually disappear. Another few minutes passed and after gradually regaining control over his body he could finally move. He opened his eyes, sat up and the being was nowhere to be found. He found it odd that his pet budgey was going berserk in its cage too, mainly because it had never done it before. He was brave about it and headed straight back to his bed to continue sleeping.

Now this is where it gets a little creepier. My dad never told anybody about what happened that night. He was too busy thinking about what it could have been and why he wasn't able to move. He looked into alien abductions and all sorts of other similar night terrors.

A week later, his older brother (my uncle) told him what happened to him one night shortly after my dad's incident. Apparently he was awoken with the same horrible feeling of being watched. His bed was on one side of the room, leaving the other side pretty bare. He was also on his back but his head was facing into the open space. After realising he couldn't move he opened his eyes in panic. That was when he saw something. Something which was, in his eyes, unexplainable. There, standing in the middle of his room, was a ""pale, white, spindly figure with big, black eyes and no nose"". It was just looking at him. He couldn't do anything but close his eyes. He claimed that he somehow just drifted back to sleep and woke up struggling to remember what happened.

Afterwards, my dad told him everything about his experience and they both were in complete disbelief. Why would they have both seen the same thing at similar times yet at different angles?

I'll begin with my own theories.

I adhere to a more scientific notion of 'ghosts'. Meaning I don't believe that there is a theological answer to paranormal occurrences but rather a scientific avenue that hasn't been discovered or a fluke of nature. These beliefs apply not only to 'ghosts' but to all of my views on the paranormal.

Unfortunately, due to the very nature of the paranormal, ie that it is not explainable at the time of occurring, I can only work in conjecture and experience. 

My own experiences and understanding of the things around me leads me to believe that ghosts are a sort of conscious residue of sorts. As though the conscious self has been left behind after death due to some type of anomaly. I have had my share of strange experiences and some of which have caused me to completely discard my previous understandings and start anew. 

I'm interested in seeing what other's believe and if anyone shares the view I have.

When I was 14, we (my family) moved from our home in california, to a deescalate place in the nevada desert not to far from Pyramid Lake. The first strange occurrence happened within the first week or so, about eight years ago. We were all in our trailer (we were building the house at the time, it was previously vacant property) and I was getting ready for bed. I was just about to close the blinds by my bed, when as i'm looking outside, a light sweeps and crosses the adjacent hill. Like someone was walking up to it with a really bright flash light. I told everyone what I saw so everyone else went to the window, and it happened again, for everyone to see. We were creeped the hell out now. We all go outside to look and see if there is a person out there (we thought maybe the neighbor who lived half a mile away had walked over or something) no one. Also, it's important to note that there was fresh snow on the ground, about a foot deep, and there was no footprints of any kind. We tried to explain it as cars from the road (thats almost a quarter mile away) helicopters etc. But nothing added up. So we decided to let it go as something we just couldn't explain, and didn't dwell to long on it. 

Later (I don't remember when as this was about 8 years ago, a few months after the other occurrence) me and my brother we walking up our driveway, when suddenly a bright flash of light filled the ground, (where we were looking) I asked my brother if he saw it, and he said he had. It was a clear evening, and the sun had gone down over the mountains, an there was no inclement whether anywhere in sight. We brushed it off and kept going. 

Things become a bit jumbled in my memory, but only so far as to the timeline of the events, but not the events themselves. 

Another occasion, I was walking up the driveway at dusk, at about the same spot as the flash of light, I hear a very deep growl. Almost like a animal/human, but nothing discernibly came from it, just sound. I looked around and didn't see anything or anyone (remember I'm 20 miles from the nearest payphone, 8 miles from the nearest paved road.) It was utterly quiet around me. I felt bothered and walked faster, and I now avoid being outside at night here. 

One particular occasion annoyed the shit out of me. My car key, just one key, not a key chain, disappeared. I always ritualistically put it on my desk when I get home, well, one morning it was just gone. I mean absolutely gone, I felt like I was going crazy (and this isn;t the first time I've had things go missing, I never got my retainers back that also went missing) After looking everywhere, EVERYWHERE, i gave up. We had suspected that something had taken them, but what could we do? Well, one night my mom was laying awake in bed, she said she felt something cover her. As though it was a blanket or something. She told me she talked to it, told it that if it meant no harm it should return the key. No one, even her expected a response. The next morning, my mom cleaned her closet out, specifically cleaned the dresser off, well, no key was there. Jump forward about 10 hours when we all arrived home. She went to her closet like always, to change her clothes, and there, onto of her dresser, was my car key. How it got there while everyone was gone, i have only guesses. 

As a general rule here, electronics are constantly going haywire. Our water pump would stop working randomly, or not so randomly for example when my dad would go to take a bath, the pump would stop working, but at no other time did it do that. Random luck? Possibly I guess, but unlikely in conjunction with everything else. Smoke alarms with perfectly good batteries would go off, being set off by one room or another. Our washer electric parts have all gone out six times. 

Many things happen such as a picture falling off the wall, we checked the nail and cable, both secure, had no reason to fall. Bottle cap thrown on the floor (shoved maybe?) Constant footsteps in the house at night, when no one is up. Talking, light whispers, normal talking etc. I've actually laid in my bed and heard a man and woman talking in our downstairs. Our downstairs is a daylight basement, that no one in my family EVER uses at night, and barely in the day. It's unfinished and mostly a storage area. I often feel watched from right outside my window, to the point where I get up and pull the curtains closed. Heavy banging on the iron man pillars downstairs, that literally can be felt in bed. The list goes on and on. We constantly have things disappear, my brothers knives, my moms recipes, my shit. 

I was actually laying in bed one night, quite awake, when I heard something whisper my name into my ear. Needless to say I got up and put a movie on, just so I could cast aside any noises from that point forward, as the movie. 

One very strange night, the night the earthquake in haiti struck, my mom was in her room, awake in bed. My girlfriend at the time had stayed over, and being in an unfinished house, my mom didn't have her door on yet, but she had hung a sheet in the doorway fro privacy, because we had company (my gf) anyways, that night my mom woke up to sobbing noises, a man sobbing and wailing. She said she had never heard anyone so grief stricken, just an absolute sadness. A deep sobbing, as if someone had just loss someone close to them. My mother actually thought at the time it was my brother, perhaps his dog had died, she said that she couldn't think of anything that would make him that upset. She got up, pulled the sheet back to step out, and as soon as she did, the noise stopped. That same night, as a slept next to my GF i woke up, and felt like something was looking at me from my open doorway. I rolled over and buried my face into my sleeping GF shoulder, and went back to sleep. 

We have cats and on one occasion, about 9 months ago, we heard the cat (1 of 2)  in the basement hissing, growling, with his hair standing up, then he came flying up the stairs into our great room. later, about 2 days later, the other cat, was sitting on the last landing before the stairs descended into the basement door, he was hissing and growling with his hair standing up, staring into a visibly empty door. What the fuck was it? Again, we can only speculate what it was. 

A very recent occurrence, just a week ago, my mom was watching TV and surfing her laptop, and the dogs were all laying around her on the floor. My dad left the room, to go outside, he came back about 5 mins later, and found the door deadbolted. My mom was there and didn't see anything, and neither did the dogs. 

There's more things to add, and i'll add them later, but this should do for now. Also, I'll update this post as more things happen.

* When I was with my father while he was driving from one city to another, I saw some kind of white figure passing by, very brief, but I am sure that I saw.
* Once when I was together with some friends having a sleepover at my grandma's house(in the only room upstairs, in a really old building, after my grandfather had died there), we were telling horror stories to each other, and after that the door of the room we were in just opened and closed really fast and made a loud sound. By the time of the night, my grandma was already sound asleep and my uncle was out. My mother didn't come to the trip to my grandma's with me.

And now comes what happened last week. I was going to the apartment's balcony and besides of it there is some small room we use to storage stuff. When I looked there, I saw a little girl walking inside there. My mother and my sister were out by the time and I was alone. I was scared as fuck and ran to my bedroom and called my mother telling her to come here asap.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_vnhcz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/vnhcz/me0last_weeks_experience/,

In particular, a lot of peculiar things that have happened to me to date occurred when I was a child.

When I was 3 years old, my family moved across the country, from the south to the Pacific Northwest (represent!) The house that my parents ended up renting was in Renton, WA, and was generally creepy, basement in particular. Weird things happened: My Mom and Dad saw a strange flash of light in the kitchen once, as though a flashbulb were going off (according to them) but there was no explanation for the flash. We heard smashing, breaking noises in the basement, but when my parents would go downstairs to check it out, nothing would be amiss. When my Mom was asleep, she thought she felt something touch her foot, etc etc. 

Once, my mom discovered me down in the basement, eating Cheetos and talking to someone, who I told her was the old man. 
I have a vague memory of this old man in the basement, but it is hazy at best. I only remember him being there, and not really anything that was said.

After this, my Mom, not being a fool, asked the neighbors about who had lived there before us, and it turns out an old man had died in the house!

Another of my memories is of playing with my cousin in the field behind an apartment building where I lived. I must have been around 6 years old. Across the field was a chain link fence that we avoided because sometimes, there would be a man standing there on the other side of the fence, watching my cousin and I, but then he would disappear, only to reappear a little while later. 

Even as a child, I never actually thought he was really there, even though I could see him sometimes, but I never questioned myself about what that meant, my child's brain accepted my intuitive response for what it was, nothing more or less. 

I spoke to my cousin recently and asked her if she remember the man by the fence, to which she replied 'Sure, the man who wasn't really there.' 

You might chalk it up to childish nonsense, but I believe that my cousin and I were seeing a ghost. My cousin and I never confided in one another our shared suspicion that the man was not actually there, but when I heard her say that, I felt that some immaterial truth had been confirmed in my mind, and it gave me chills. 

Another time, in that same field, my cousin and I were playing a game with a stick- We would ask the stick a yes or no question, and the stick would move one way for yes, and another way for no. The stick was shaped in such a way that it could rock on its curve in two different possible directions; to and fro or back and forth.

Allow me to say that the wind was not blowing, it was summery weather and very warm, without much breeze, and the movements of the stick were too precise in correlation to the answers of the questions to be accidental. The questions were stupid kiddy type questions.  

I actually did not think much of this memory until just a few years ago, when I began to really analyze it. Prior to that, it was just another unexamined childhood memory, taken for granted. But now I want to know: how was that stick moving on its own? Why was a stick answering our questions? What put it into our minds that if we posed a question to the stick, that 'something' would answer? Why does this memory seem strange to me now, when I had accepted it without thought for years beforehand?

Fast forward a few years. My mom and I are living in a different apartment, on the other side of town. I am playing with a friend in the hallway of the apartment we lived in, minding my own business, when I look up from the hall in to my bedroom. I was not expecting (obviously) to see anything out of the ordinary, but standing in the center of my bedroom, directly within my line of sight, was a solid black outline of a person! My heart jumped and I can absolutely still remember feeling a sharp frisson of horror that someone was in my bedroom, but as soon as this registered in my brain, the person was gone, as if they winked out of existence. I remember my friend being freaked out by how freaked out I was, they went home and didn't come back over again. Also, I didn't go back in to my room for weeks after that. I think I was around 8 years old or so.

I have told this story many times, and have come to the conclusion (with the help of various other persons) that I saw a shadow person. So far, this is the only shadow person I have seen.

I'll conclude this post with a creepy story that was passed down to me from my Mom and Auntie. 

When they were kids, they lived in a house that had a bathroom which was only accessible by going through the kitchen. In the kitchen, there was a window over the sink with a low hanging roof outside. The way my Mom tells it, she used to hate to do the dishes in the evenings because she always had the irrational fear that something was peeking over the edge of the roof at her. She said she would do those damn dishes as fast as she could so she could get out from under that creepy feeling of being watched. 

When I asked my Mom why she never shared this feeling with her own Mom, she said it was because she felt silly about it. Of course there wasn't someone on the roof, peeking down at her.

Years later after they had grown up and moved far away from that house, my Auntie and my Mom were talking about childhood memories, and my Auntie confessed to my Mom that when they lived in that house, my Auntie would run like hell through the kitchen to the bathroom at night, because she always felt like something was peeking over the edge of the roof at her through the kitchen window.

1331909341.0,17,self.Thetruthishere,qzf3o,My Husband's Experiences,Sigatsu,20,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/qzf3o/my_husbands_experiences/,"My husband is completely skeptically about anything paranormal. He’s mildly amused by all the paranormal TV shows out there and says that some of the “evidence” they show intrigues him.

As a child he had two experiences that still stick with him. Once when he was a young child, probably between 4 and 5 years old, he was playing on the floor. He said the sun was shining and he cast a shadow on the wall in front of him. 

He played with his shadow, moving his hand back and forth really fast. Then he stopped…but the shadow didn’t. He said the shadow hand kept moving back and forth really fast..then slowed down..then stopped..then the hand came down and rested in the position on the floor, he had his hand in. 

Hubby said that it scared him shitless and he ran from the room. He never played with his shadow again.

As an adult, he thinks it was just his eyes playing tricks on him but I when I asked him, “Why did it slow down and move it’s hand into place? If it was the image of the shadow burned into your eyes because of the sun, wouldn’t it just keep moving fast and then stop as the image faded?”

He didn’t know why and just shrugged it off.

The next time something strange happened to him was when he was a few years older, around 7 years old.

This was in a different house.

My Hubby and his brother shared a bedroom and a bed, when they were young. They were typical kids and didn’t immediately go to sleep when they were supposed to, but stayed awake giggling and talking in bed.

One night they were talking too loudly and suddenly saw a shadow in the doorway. They thought it was their older brother who was in the next room sleeping. He would usually come over and tell them to shut up or he’d punch them.

So, my Hubby’s brother picked up a shoe from the floor and flung it at the doorway. The shoe went through the shadow and into the next room.

They both freaked and hid under the covers.

My husband says when he looked back on the incident he realized the shadow was nearly as tall as the doorway, which had to be 7 foot. It was very skinny too. His older brother wasn’t over 5’ 10” and not that skinny.

He says he can’t explain that one but maybe they were both hallucinating because they knew they weren’t supposed to be awake goofing around on a school night. They KNEW their older brother usually came in the room and threatened to beat them if they didn’t go to sleep. So maybe, my husband rationalized, they imagined something they expected to see.

Many years later, my Hubby and I share a house with his Mother. One side of the house has a home office in the front.

I didn’t know this then but about 8 years ago, he was sitting at the computer late at night and thought he heard me call him. He says he distinctly heard my voice say his name.

He answered but I didn’t answer back. He sat there for a second listening and then realized I was sleeping in our bedroom which was on the other side of the house in the back.

Of course , I know I didn’t call out for him.

He says he’s not ashamed to say it gave him the chills and he immediately shut down the computer and went to bed.

To this day he insists he probably was just very tired and hallucinating.
 
I don’t know…maybe he was.

Whenever I think back on this experience, it feels 'wrong'. Dark and disturbing. I knew instinctively at the time, and still feel now that I was visited by something old and malevolent.

I was woken suddenly in the night and lay still, hardly breathing, straining my ears into the silence. I wasn't sure if I'd been woken by a sound, but I'd instantly gone into 'alert mode' and was listening for any sound - some clue as to why I'd woken so suddenly and felt so on edge.

The silence went unbroken, but I got the distinct feeling that there was somebody in the house. An image formed in my mind's eye of a black mist swirling about in the living room. As if sensing my awareness of it, the mist drifted toward the hallway leading to the bedroom. As it approached, it formed a tall black human shape, and I could hear it's footsteps on the wood flooring. They were getting closer as I lay there and listened in wide-eyed horror.

As the steps passed the open bathroom doorway right outside my bedroom, I heard the sound change as you'd expect it to when passing an opening like that. At that moment a voice urgently commanded me to shut my eyes. It seemed to come from inside my head, and I knew that it wasn't the entity, this was something else - something that was here to protect me. I obeyed, slamming my eyelids together as the footsteps crossed the threshold from the wooden floor to the carpeted bedroom and stopped beside the bed.

I could feel the malevolence radiating in the room - the thing seemed to be searching for me. As ridiculous as this sounds, I honestly think it couldn't see me when my eyes were closed. I know that's really childish but it's what I felt in that terrifying moment when I *knew* it was looking for me. Gradually the feeling of it's presence started to fade, until I knew it was gone. It was a good while before I dared to open my eyes again!

I know that this sounds a bit iffy - especially with most of it being experienced through a sort of instinctive knowledge of what was happening and pictures in my head. The footsteps were audible though. Normally I would just write this off as some sort of bizarre dream, but I *know* that I was wide awake, and I still feel hunted whenever I recount the experience - as if talking about it will attract the entity back to me. I have no idea what it's intentions were, but it still frightens me to this day.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_quq83,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/quq83/me_nocturnal_visit/,

When I'm on a plane, during those first 10,000 feet when I can't read my Kindle without a flight attendant flipping their shit, I think.  I think a lot and about everything.  Recently, I thought of this theory:

Many people maintain that there are multiple universes.  We need 11 of them to explain String Theory.  But what if there are more?  Infinite universes.  One that carries on a history for each decision everyone makes?

Let me discuss time for a second, then I'll go back to that.  Time isn't a line.  The more I think about it, the more it resembles a dough.  It can be shaped, formed, molded, ripped apart and put back together in any way it chooses.  It literally moves according to our perceptions of it, so couldn't the DIRECTION it moves be perceived as well?  So why our perceptions?  In terms of relativity, why does it seem like flirting with an attractive person takes two minutes, whereas sitting on a hot stove for the same amount of time feel like two hours?  Why is it in our perceptions?

That's what brings me back to the infinite universes.  In the time we experience earth and life, my theory is we jump between universes so that we always experience the longest life we have.  In one universe, I get in my car and get t-boned by a bus on my way to the store.  However, before that scenario plays out, I jump imperceptibly to a universe where I make it to the store and go about my day.  Maybe my friends stay in that original universe and mourn their dead friend, or maybe they all shift with me and call me to remind me to pick up some Mountain Dew.  

So how does this tie into paranormal?  What if those shifts between universes aren't so smooth all the time?  Perhaps the spectres we see are people shifting universes, and since time isn't a linear thing, we can see someone from far in the past making their impression on us.

I'm not sure if I'm making sense, haha, so please ask any questions in the comments if you want me to elaborate on any point. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_nv2kt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/nv2kt/thy_time_universes_life_death_and_ghosts/,

I think many of us are brought here by a common grievance about nosleep.  

There is just one problem: If you're anything like me, you only have a handful of stories. Older members have already shared these encounters. So what is our next course of action? How do we keep these posts coming when there's a drought of new members?
---------

Most of us don't seek out experiences, and once we've shared our stories, all we can do is sit back and read others. It's one thing I don't think we considered when creating the sub. I mean, I'd love to be a consistent contributor but I can't unless I repost. 

**Brainstorming Ideas, what do you think?**

* ~~We could open up topics for discussion, in a DAE/AMA style. If you've heard something through a friend but it's not a trustworthy source, you direct a question like ""DAE hear crying at night from a room within their house?"" or ""REQUEST: someone who hears crying at night from their attic"" etc. Then, you can summarize the story you heard.~~ *Edit: this apparently shows the degradation of a sub*
* OH! that brings me to another idea: We could do something involving ""DEBUNK THIS: My friend hears crying in her attic"" and then share the story and we can all enjoy hearing ideas, related stories, and what-have-yous. 
* If you feel the need, you could draw attention back to your older posts by illustrating what you saw in a later post and linking back to your old one. 
* If you have a small incident that you feel is not worthy of a post, perhaps we can have a tag for these that indicates ""hey something weird happened to me, but it's not really interesting or scary, just unexplained and really quick and not much of a story but if it were longer or happened frequently then it would be a worthy post""?
* I'd also like to see more proof being shared. I dunno how we'd go about doing this. I don't keep a camera on me at all times and I doubt any of you do either. 
* **Open the discussion a bit. ""allow discussion on paranormal/crytid topics? I wouldn't mind open group discussion on things that fall into the realms of strange. Obviously, we don't want it to turn into r/creep with just pictures of strange things, but rather, a place to talk openly about what you believe etc.""**
* Allow accounts from people close to you. We'll need to come up with an easy tag system. They need to be short and easily typed. 
- [ME]- Your own encounter; no tag will imply self. 
- [FAM]- Family member's encounter.
- [FR]- Friend's encounter.
- [FoF]- Friend of a Friend.
- [DIS]- Discussion of what you believe in. This can also open up to questions and feedback.  
- [THY]- Theories and debunking (per request).
- [PIC]- If you drew a picture from a previous post, link to the story again and then include this. This will allow people to remain active and encourage newer members to check out the archive. Don't think we'll allow straight links to prevent this from turning into r/creepy.
- [PE]- Paranormal exploration. Advice, evidence, equipment, locations, etc.
- [/]- for encounters that have no real story. ex: ""just sitting in my boxers and then saw glowing eyes just now, and i'm on the 8th floor WTF"".
- any other topics you'd allow in here??

If you haven't already, be sure to read [shittycontributor's input](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kv58b/lets_make_an_effort_to_keep_the_community_alive/c2nnxda) and give him feedback as well.  What would you like to see implemented? Even if you think it's a poor idea, throw it out here so we can get comments and feedback. It could trigger a better idea from someone. 



In other matters, there have been some complaints about the name. I don't really see a problem with it as we're trying to encourage serious discussions about things that happened to us in our lives that we feel is the truth. I guess there's not much that can be done at this point. **I have put in a request to change it to r/theyexist, but if the name cannot be changed, then we will NOT change.**  The biggest problem is the fact that once you share all your stories, you may not ever get another experience! There was mention about a community identity which I think is a great idea. If our identity some how embraces some aspect of truthiness, perhaps it will explain the name and not seem dull? 

We have over 600 members now. If you have any ideas, we'd love to hear it. We've grown a lot faster than anticipated. 


I'll also PM the mods over at r/paranormal and r/nosleep and see if we can get a link to this. If we can get at least 3 new users a day, hopefully one will have a story to tell. If any of you know of other related subreddits to promote on, please share or tell me about it. If anyone sees someone post in a thread with a subject you think we'd be interested in, please please please encourage them to check us out! I went on vacation for a month so I'm going to start promoting and reading everyone's stories. I'm going to hopefully try and boost morale by commenting on every post I read to at least acknowledge that I read it, so expect that to happen soon. 

And as always, the mods are just a PM away. We're more than happy to receive your comments, complaints, recommendations that you're embarrassed about, ideas, or if you think someone is breaking the rules. 

I want to thank you all for supporting this sub and I am hopeful that in a few months this will be a consistently awesome sub! I know not all are patient, but hopefully we won't have to be patient for much longer. 

...and sorry about the grammar. 

**TL;DR:** We're still a relatively new community. Please ponder the following: 
------------
- Ideas on how older members can remain active without resorting to reposting their experiences
- Anything you want to see implemented
- What kind of identity as a community do you think we could achieve? Which brings us to the next one:
- Our name. How shall we make it reflective of our identity/mission statement/who we are?
- Please exercise commenting, upvoting, and passive (and shameless) promotion to increase morale and membership
----------

**We've come to realize: new members are our bread and butter. **

EDITED WITH PEOPLE'S INPUT. Despite speculation, the mods have decided NOT to relaunch to r/theyexist, but rather request the admins to change the name within here. If it cannot be done, then sorry if you don't like the name. :(

My younger cousin is more adventurous and rebellious than her older sister (the older one is the one who told me ""dancing down an indian hallway in darkness). Her friends all went out afternoon to find a place to smoke hash without being harassed by elders. One boy suggested an abandoned temple deep in the forest just outside the city limits. Eagerly, they all piled on motorcycles and set off on a dope adventure.

They arrived at the decrepit hindu temple. Vines had grown around the once elaborate carvings. The sun hit the temple through the trees, giving it an eerily serene feeling. Old idols still adorned the walls, though some of the faces and limbs crumbled apart with age. Two pillars towered over the structure, indicating an entrance.

The temple opened up to a large, outdoor portion in the center. In the center of the commons was a large, burned portion with ash. The kids ran up to the burned area. They noticed a peculiar silence within the area containing the burned sphere. There was an old dead tree off to the side.

The kids, unnerved by the silence, decided to sit under the tree, smoke a quick bowl, and gtfo. They soon forgot about the silence and were now preoccupied with attempts to blow smoke rings. One girl looked up proudly as a perfect ring floated to the top. Something caught her eye as the smoke dispersed along one of the branches.

She stood up and peered closer at the branch that the ring had emphasized before losing it's shape. A small black object hung from it's branch. One of the boys, curious, climbed up the tree half way to get a closer look at the object, now noticing there were hundreds of objects dangling from the branches.

They were human fingers. Some looked centuries old, and some still had flesh decaying off the bone. Some had painted nails; some were gnarled; some looked like they were from children.
They noticed every tree had hundreds of fingers dangling from the branches.

As they ran to their motorcycles, they noticed someone had put garlands around a pillar by the motorcycles, with a lit incense burned halfway down. As they drove away, they heard the distinct sound of knives being sharpened and a faint smell of burning flesh.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_iyag0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/iyag0/tree_ornaments/,

About 4 or 5 years ago, myself and 3 friends decided to celebrate Friday the 13th in a unique way--we wanted to explore the Chinese Graveyard. I was attending college at the University of Hawai'i, so we were all mainland transplants eager to explore this spiritual land. We knew of this one location that was in a valley, and it seemed like the easiest to get to late at night.

Since land is scarce, the graveyard was narrow but sort of spiraled up the mountain, with a large pagoda type thing at the very top. The road leading up to the main pagoda/parking lot was winding and somewhat steep and took approx. 3-5 minutes, depending on how slow you drive.
At the base of the mountain, we were all really pumped. The mood was particularly creepy that night, probably induced by reading chapters from the ""Obake Files"" to get us hyped up about supernatural Hawai'i, but being Freshmen or Sophomores we hadn't really taken it seriously--we all still scoffed at the ghost stories our local friends would tell us about. But per usual, it was a beautiful and clear night.

As we slowly ascended up the mountain, the headlights shimmered over the polished tombstones (chinese tombstones are shiny, narrow pillars instead of the stereotypical cement rounded slab). At first, it wasn't a big deal. We could make out some of the chinese writing from the car as the light hit it. After we got further up the mountain, we noticed people running away from us. It looked like an innocent game of hide and seek, and being Friday the 13th we assumed we couldn't have been the only people who had this idea. Then we noticed every person was wearing red. As soon as the light hit a tombstone, we'd see someone wearing red dart off into the darkness. And it happend every time, to each tombstone the headlights caught. 

We were expecting to get to the top to encounter some cars and mischievous teens, but the parking lot stood empty. The top was silent. We sat down and discussed what we had seen. There must have been no more than 100 people running away from us, wearing red, heading to this pagoda. There would be no place for anyone to run off to once at the top.

We sort of freaked out at that point and jumped into the car and started our descent. Again we saw people wearing red running away from us, so we each took great care in observing what we were seeing. Since coming down the mountain hit different tombstones, we still saw them, though we noticed no one ran from tombstones that we already saw on the ascent. They were definitely people, but they weren't all wearing the same thing, but the color was definitely red. They ran away too quickly to notice any detail, but we all noticed that there was no trace of them once the headlight was gone. They simply vanished as soon as the headlight hit another tombstone.

It was like each soul was just sitting in front of their pillar, and when the light came they rolled onto their feet and darted off in either annoyance, shame, or timidness. I felt guilty for disturbing their peace for a childish yearning.

A lot of creepy things happened to me during my 5 years in Hawai'i, but this was by far the most unexplainable, and witnessed by 4 sets of eyes.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_ix41v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ix41v/friday_the_13th_hawaiian_style/,

The post explains the layout of it, what I think is here, and what's been going on: http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1hdfkr/my_house_is_haunted/

So, after I posted this, whatever's in my house calmed down and nothing that I couldn't really pass off happened. I mean, I had the usual ""I'm being watched"" feelings, I'd see things out of the corner of my eye, etc. But nothing that was too bad.

Until literally a few seconds ago.

So, this weekend is an anime convention, my little sister and father went to it all three days (Friday, Saturday, and today), but I only went two days (Friday and Saturday). So, they're out right now and they have been since around 11am. No-one else lives here, we don't have any pets, and the AC/heat is off right now.

Also, I should be reiterate from the first post that we literally haven't gone in our attic since the first day we moved in because it's so dusty and there's nothing we need to keep there.

I just heard something heavy running across the attic floor, right over my room. There's no way anyone could have gotten up there without me hearing (as stated in the first post, the only way to get up there is to pull down this drawstring staircase that's in the family room, about 10 yards from my room.) because, even if the stairs were used a lot, which they're not, they'd be loud because it's made of wood and metal. And it can't have been animals because it sounded more like boot steps, there weren't any claws clacking/scraping, and it was too heavy.

I'm actually really scared right now, but I know (hope) nothing's going to happen. I'm now on high alert listening for anything else. I'll keep you guys updated.

*Edit*: I said I'd keep you guys updated. I had to pee so I went to the bathroom (which is literally right next to my room), and now I hear slithering sounds and low growls/whispers outside the door. I'm done, but I'm too nervous to go out. I know it's probably because I'm on high alert and reading too much into things, but it's still weird and nervewracking!

*Edit 2*: I just kind of ran out of my bathroom, nothing was there, but I'm moving downstairs to the living room. Hopefully that'll help.",,False,,t5_2sntx,1373842257.0,,,True,t3_1iat4k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1iat4k/an_update_on_my_haunted_house/,

In the past, I've been a very creative and talented individual.  I'm not bragging, I'm repeating what was told to me.  I often see things that others don't; faces in the wall made up of shadows, smiley faces in the microwave, things like that.  And I'm hoping against hope that what has happened to and around me is just a slight lack of sleep and an over active imagination.

It's summer where I live, and in Nebraska, it's really hot.  The heat just kills any sort of initiative that I may show.  So I usually sleep in the day, when it's not too hot, and stay up all night and do my thing; baking, cleaning, drawing and writing.  Now, of those things I usually spend most of my time on either Facebook or DeviantArt, so I'm always on the computer.

Recently, because the weather's warmer, bugs have arrived.  Flys, moths, wasps, beetles, and spiders have made their way into the house.  Not a big deal, just kill them or catch them and stick them outside.  But last night, there seemed to be an abnormal amount of bugs in the house after my boyfriend fell asleep, leaving me in the living room by myself. 

I had all the windows open, so I just figured there was creepy crawlies coming in through the window.  I would just move across the room, and usually the bugs would stay there.  I must have moved several times last night, all for the same reason.  Bugs.  Of course, now I can ""feel"" them everywhere; crawling up my legs, tickling the back of my neck, when it's really just a cord or my hair.

Another thing that happened that makes me believe that something's not right here is the lemon.  My boyfriend absolutely loves iced tea with a slice of lemon in it.  I had moved across the living room, dragging my computer and cords with me, to sit where he was sitting before he went to bed.  His laptop is right here next to my feet and his empty glass that held his tea is there too.  Inside is the lemon slice.  I placed my laptop on the couch and turned around to plug in the cord in the power strip.  When I turned back, there was the lemon slice on the seat of the couch, right where I was going to sit.  I put it back in his glass.

Last night, I was baking pita bread so that we could have hiros (I'm not sure how to spell it, sorry), when I got the distinct feeling that something wasn't right.  My boyfriend was asleep and our other roomie was asleep in his room in the basement.  I was the only one up.  

I had opened the windows, because it was warm in the kitchen from the oven, and had just sat down to play a game while I waited for the bread to bake, when I heard a creak from the kitchen.  It was just a little sound, like someone had dropped a needle on the counter or something.  I figured the cookie sheet had warped in the oven, or a plate shifted in the sink.  I went into the kitchen and got the pita bread out of the oven, started a new batch and started dishes.  I stuffed the towel through the cupboard's handle and left the room.

When I came back a few minutes later, the towel was draped over the same cupboards door.  No one in our house does that, and I remember that I stuffed the towel there.  I shrugged it off, cursing my short term memory and went back to the living room.  My boyfriends guitar was leaning against the wall, and when I walked in, it twanged at me.

I'm not sure what's going on, if it's just my imagination, but it's driving me nuts.  I figured I would share it with you guys just in case it's not me.

1371935997.0,15,self.Thetruthishere,1gvifn,[ME] I have no luck with houses or neighborhoods. (Long!),replicates,15,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gvifn/me_i_have_no_luck_with_houses_or_neighborhoods/,"Hello, everyone! This is my first post, and while I've read the rules and sidebar and such, I'm worried about flubbing something up, so if I've messed up in some way, please tell me and I'll change it ASAP.

Anyway, I've experienced two separate incidents (or, a collection of incidents, broken into two areas) that have really left me questioning things since they happened.

The first was when I still lived with my mother out in the middle of the woods. I never liked the area, because...well, woods are creepy and weird things happen in them!

From the time we moved in, the house didn't feel right to me. Maybe it was because it was back in the woods, but I had an unsettling feeling from the time I stepped into the house. My very first night there, I ended up getting no sleep at all, because there was an odd tapping under my floor the entire night.

For a while, nothing happened, and I was just left with that unsettled feeling and occasional worry that the woods outside the window were getting closer.

However, as weeks passed, I began to experience odd things, like seeing things in the corner of my eye. I brushed it off at first, because I was naturally on edge being on my own all the time (my mother worked all day and drunk all night) and expected to be a little wigged out. Gradually, I realize that what I was seeing out of the corner of my eyes were in the shape of animals and people. Nothing serious, just like someone had walked by quickly when I was turned away. It became more frequent over time, and often I would leave for the neighbor's house when I got too freaked out. Apparently, this was normal around spring time. 

This culminated in two separate happenings, though I can't remember which happened first, since it's been about seven years.

One was the night I had my friend over for the first time. We were returning from my neighbor's house, and this involved going up her long driveway, and down mine. We had just left her driveway and were making the turn past the mailbox to get to mine, when my friend stops, and starts staring into the wooded area next to it. I ask her what's going on, and she points to a spot not too far away where there seems to be a white light sort of hovering around. Being two thirteen-year-olds alone at night in a heavily wooded area, we haul butt straight down the driveway and to my house.

The second took place shortly after I changed to the bedroom across the hall from my original one.

I woke suddenly at about four a.m. one morning, which wasn't really unusual at that point, as I had trouble sleeping when I suddenly was in a different area. I'd like to point out: There was *no way* I was dreaming at this point. I'd been awake and moving around for a good twenty minutes, and thus wide awake. I'd settled back on my bed to read until I got tired again. Suddenly, there was an odd clanging noise from under my bed, which made no sense, because I'd been told there were no pipes located beneath the room I was in for whatever reason. Out of nowhere, my bed starts shaking like crazy. Not my room, just my bed.

Needless to say, I booked it out of that room very quickly. I started sleeping in there again later at my mother's insistence, and nothing ever happened again.

There weren't any real big incidents after that. I'd have small things, like the feeling of a hand on my back when I was alone, or my cousin (who moved in with us with her mother at one point) reporting the front door knob rapidly shaking at one point when she was in the house alone, but seeing no one when she looked out the sliding door to the patio.

I did have the experience of going back to my original room when I went back for a visit (I'd moved because the room made me uncomfortable, but started sleeping in the living room until I moved out once my aunt and cousin took the room), and trying to sleep in there. The unsettled feeling I'd had magnified to the point of being a feeling like I *had* to get out. Ended up sleeping in the living room with my brother.




The second series of incidents occurred about three or so years later, when I was living with my Dad at the house I just recently moved out of. 

Now, the area we lived in had no history of incidents or odd behavior, that I'd heard from anyone. In fact, we bought the house *ourselves*, newly built so there was nothing odd with it that I could find. The house did not prove to be any sort of issue! The road outside of it, on the other hand, was very much one.

What threw me off about this one was how suddenly things started. I'd lived there for a good year before, taking that road every single day without issue before.

See, the way to get to the bus stop in my neighborhood from my house is simple: You go down to the end of the road we live on, take a turn onto the second road (forming an L shape), and then finally turn onto the third one, and wait at the streetlight in the middle. Did this every day, no problem.

But one day, when it's hit that time of year where it's pitch black early in the morning, something weird happens and I hear my name being called. I figure it's someone from my house or my not!step-family who lives down the street from us, and turn around to see what they want. No one. Street is dead. So I chalk it up to my imagination and keep going. Next few days, everything is normal.

Then, once I get just past my house one day, I hear something move in the grass, and the growl of a dog. My neighbors seemed to hate keeping their dogs in their own yards, so dodging angry canines is something I'm used to. But when I go to jerk out of the way as soon as I hear the sound of movement, there's nothing solid. Instead I see what looks like a shadowy outline of an animal run by and disappear. Naturally, I freak out, turn right around and run the short distance home in tears.

After that day, I saw things like that every single morning. It became seeing shadowy people crossing the street right in front of me, or one just standing at the corner where you turn onto the next road before vanishing.

But the weirdest thing was how it was confined to only that one street. I never saw *anything* on the other or the street my bus picks me up on. Very quickly, I developed a sever phobia of that street, and my dad had to resort to driving me to the bus stop or school because I'd have a panic attack just trying to go out the door otherwise. I still can't, unfortunately, though I haven't seen anything since.


...If you made it through, thank you. and I'm sorry for the length!

I'd be really happy to hear any sort of debunking or explanations anyone might have for this. To this day, I can't explain any of it beyond somehow dreaming while walking for the second one.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1gvifn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gvifn/me_i_have_no_luck_with_houses_or_neighborhoods/,

Now the bedroom itself was a large room facing the street, this was a ground floor flat, it also had a large window covering an entire wall facing the street and it also had a large Italian wardrobe. This is the setting of the room finished and next comes the story. It begins with a normal night of doing some homework and watching TV until about 10:30 and then I go to sleep. I remember the dream vividly as if it was a memory it involved my grandma how had died when I was young she was a nice person who would do anything to help you out. so I went to sleep and dreamt I was in 2 places at the same time meaning that I was looking at myself sleeping but I was also sleeping at the same time, the me that was sleeping had 'woken up' and the me that was looking had disapered so when I ""woke up"" in the dream I was in the bedroom and everything looked the same, apart from the window which had the netting but no curtains like they had been taken off and the headboards for the beds had dissapered, I looked out of the window and saw a figure that looked like my grandma but dressed in white with deep sunken facial features and darkness for eyes and there was a gentle but ghastly glow emanating from this thing, when I looked up at ""her"" she reminded me of my grandma but not as I remembered her this thing had a strange terrible aura that I didn't like. I then had a strange feeling to let her in, I can remember that I was about to get out of bed to open the door to this thing even though I knew it was the wrong thing to do, and as I lifted the covers of myself to let it in I had another strange feeling to just go back to sleep and everything will be better in the morning. I went back to sleep and woke up to the sun shining though the window, funny thing is we always closed the curtains at night to stop the street light coming through. I always thought you forget you dreams but its been 6 years now and I still remember that figure in white.

So I apologise if I've missed anything that is confusing time-wise.

Upon the second night of living in this house, I poured myself a cup of cordial and placed it on the clean bench before turning the lights out and going to bed. Then, at around midnight I heard a strange tinkling sound.

I got up straight away to look, not bothering to turn the light on because the bathroom light sufficed. I couldn't see anything wrong so I shrugged it off and went back to bed, thinking it was just a fork that had fallen from the dish rack into the sink.

Now, I might mention at this point that we did not yet have our cat. Our only pets were two pythons, safely locked away in their tanks.
When I got up in the morning, I went to make my coffee. What I discovered shocked and puzzled me. The glass on the counter was broken, the broken pieces inside of it instead of outside.

My fiancé was still asleep, as he had been all night (he sleeps like a log and doesn't rise until he wakes in the morning), so there was no way it could have been him.

I knew it had to be paranormal, but I did my best to ignore it. I slammed the walls down around the part of my mind that allows us to sense the paranormal, afraid of what would happen if I didn't just block it all out.

This worked for a while, until two months later my fifteen year old sister came to live under my care.

The first week or so of being here, she woke up with red hand prints on her legs, like something had slapped or grabbed her in her sleep. Used to these kinds of things, she shrugged it off. I, however, began to worry.
The next week something else happened. I had had a long day, and was too tired to do the dishes after I had cooked dinner. So I left them intending to do them in the morning.

The big electric frying pan was sitting on top of the glass cutting board. My cat was sleeping in my lap, while my sisters cat was locked in her room with her for the night as she is very destructive and breaks things.

Again, this was around midnight. I was playing a game on my iPod, sitting in bed when suddenly I heard a loud CRASH! And then a clatter.
I jumped up, sending my disgruntled kitty flying off the bed. I rushed into the kitchen, where the noise had come from.

There, on the floor, was the glass cutting board. Completely unharmed, despite being thrown with considerable force onto the slate floor.

Shocked, I looked around. The frying pan was where I left it, unmoved. How could that be, when the cutting board had evidently fallen from underneath it somehow? Spooked, I picked my cat (Jungle) up and went back to bed.

Things quietened down for a few months, then something bigger happened.
It was 2am, I was home alone reading The Hunger Games. My cat sat in my lap, my sisters cat was in her room. All the lights were on and my door was open about ten or twenty centimeters. I don't know why, but I began staring out the door into the lounge room. As I was staring something black walked quickly past the door. Needless to say, I was terrified! I don't often actually see spirits, more often I just feel and hear them (perhaps because I try to block them out), so this is why I was so terrified.
I just hugged my cat to my chest and prayed to the goddess. Eventually, I fell asleep.

The next night I was home alone at the same time when I heard the most terrifying sound. An unmistakable sound. Moaning, the loud moaning of an adult male. And it was coming from my closet! I was so terrified that I was almost in tears, until my cat came running into my room and sat in my lap, comforting me and staring at the closet.

The next day I asked my sister if anything scares her here, and what she said gave me chills. Every night, when she turns her light out, a man stands by her door and just stares at her. She reassured me that this doesn't really bother her, though.

To add to this, since this was written a year ago, I very clearly watched my DVD player fly off the TV cabinet and break. I also watched the electric frying pan flip over from it's place on the bench, and the corner of the handle broke off. It wasn't even anywhere near the edge. Locked doors would open. My bedroom door almost always swung back and forth, sometimes very very fast and sometimes it was barely noticeable.

Well, that's all I've got for now. I could probably add to this later but right now I have things I have to do.

Apologies if this post is too story-like, that's just my writing style.

So my grandma was young when she got married, 19 I think? She was an immigrant from Germany and came to America when she was 16 not knowing any English. She was very shy and didn't talk much, but with her mother she would go to the German club in town (I guess just a meet up for German-Americans to eat, drink, dance etc.) Finally, a young man came up to her, (about 4 years older) asking to dance, who ended up being my grandfather. They had the love-bug, ya know falling in love, getting married, going places, having two kids at a young age early in the 1960's. 

Everything goes well until my grandpa started staying away from their house more, my grandma being suspicious, arguing. Ultimately, he was cheating on her, and/or pimping out the town whore. This was truthfully a really big ordeal and had an everlasting impact on the family. My grandma was left a single mother with two children aged 7 and 3, and my grandfather was left with the town whore. Both of them did not want it to be this way, but from what my grandmother tells me- he was stuck with her, meaning she had him trapped in some way. (I'm sorry I'm not giving you more information but I wish I knew the whole story as well. All I know is that what happened was a very big deal.)

Their lives go on, the children were raised splendidly, my grandmother remained single, besides having another short marriage in the late 80's, and my grandfather is still with the same woman, having 2 more children. This is 45 years later. 

One day my mother is over my grandmother's house for no reason, just to spend time. My grandmother has to share the dream she had the previous night. She said that she was with Alfred (my grandfather) and everything was fine, and the kids were raised and everything seemed to be bliss. She also explained she never thought of Alfred, and not purposely but just because she was over it and it was the past. She hasn't ever had a dream like that or of that ever.

My mother explained to her that my grandfather had a heart-attack the same night as the dream and went through triple-bypass heart surgery. 

Is it really a coincidence that this happened on the same night? My theory is that we have some unknown sense that we can't consciously trigger or use.. Something was communicated in both of their minds sending some type of message between each other while my grandfather was on his deathbed, maybe regretting what he did and letting her know?

I can bravely say that I have always been an afraid person: I slept in my parents room well beyond a reasonable age. If I would use the restroom at night every light would have to be turned on and only turned off when I was safely back in my room. I still have difficulty sleeping with my back to an open space. Growing up with these simple fears and growing into manhood, I spent much of my time proving to myself and others that I was brave, fearless. I have experienced many amazing situations due to this need of courage: I have slept nights under the stars on the Appalachian and Pacific Crest Trails. I've crossed the United States twice opting to sleep at sometimes isolated rest stops instead of hotels. I explored off the beaten path foreign countries to maintain that I was strong enough to face the world.

I say all this because, for me, this post is to explore an experience in my life; in my memory, that I can never explain. It isn't necessarily scary. I wasn't afraid at the time of the experience, but I am still afraid to remember it. Sometimes I'm curious if all my fears are derived from this moment.

I grew up in rural Central Georgia (U.S.A.) on a small soybean farm. My father had chosen to build his home on a dirt road less than a quarter of a mile from his parents; my grandparents. I spent most of my summer days with my grandmother as it was a free source of childcare. I was not an easy kid to handle behaviorally. I talked back, threw fits when I did not get my way, and explored/plundered endlessly. My grandmother was always serious about her cooking. She  has spent much of her life in the kitchen feeding my entire family. I would dig through cabinets and drawers as she battered and fried any food under the sun. My grandmother would get understandably frustrated with my rambunctiousness while she cooked. In order to remedy this her tactic was to tell me to take whatever item I had found that day into the living to watch TV.

I vividly remember being 5 years old; an age not easily recalled. I remember it as if it were a dream from the night before.

On this particular day, under the china cabinet, I had found a wicker basket full of rocks or stones. Some were smooth; polished with jagged edges. Another was bigger; made of a more porous stone with a bowl-like area worn into it. I had these and several other pieces strewn about the floor in front of me examining them, imagining for what purpose they might be used.

Over my shoulder towards the kitchen doorway where my grandmother would be, cooking, I began to feel her presence. Assuming it was just her checking in on me I ignored the feeling. The feeling might have turned into something stronger, because eventually I turned around to look behind me.

In the doorway stood a man. The exposed skin of his body looked red: a deeper, more copper skin than I had ever seen before or seen since this day. I remember a muscular build and colorful garments; although, I can't remember with a clear enough accuracy the style of clothing. Any attempts to remember clothes seems like a polluted thought imposed upon by stereotypical Native American garb.

This man, I remember, looked directly at me. He then turned to the back portion of the small country house and once again back at me. Without a word from either of us he turned and began walking in the direction he had gazed; out of my sight. 

After a moment of naive thought I stand and follow to where I had seen this copper-skinned man. I am now standing in the doorway to the kitchen visible to my grandmother; and also where the vision had stood. I look expecting to see him in the parlor-like area beyond the dining area. To my confusion the man was outside of the house. Seen through the panes of glass in a closed window. He was disappearing into the soybean stalks.

""Jon. You ok?"" my grandmother called me back to reality. 

My memory fails me here yet again. I can't recall if I asked her then and there if she had seen the man, but in more recent conversations she has expressed not remembering the day, but verified that I often played with the arrowheads and Indian artifacts. I don't remember having spoken about this event openly for some time afterwards.

I do remember being still young and forming my first concepts of Native Americans and having these events spur terrifyingly back into my consciousness. 

Harvesting soybeans with my grandfather in a combine tractor one afternoon we drove over a dry, sandy spot in the field. I asked him why nothing grew there. His answer caused me great fear. 

The dry spot, he said, was a natural occurring irrigation route. He collected many of the arrowheads and the grinding stone along the sand here. He said it was possible a family of Creek Indians had lived on this land we now owned.

I don't remember being afraid of the events that day until later in life. I grew into the fear as I pieced together, still as a child, that I had seen something currently, that may have existed previously. 

The fear that I still battle today may be contributed to learning a concept for the paranormal before I was able to attempt to understand the paranormal.




Further notes/thoughts:

I say earlier that I ""remember it as if it were a dream from the night before"". A complicating factor in this story is that I have counted myself fortunate to be someone who dreams in color and can even make conscious decisions while dreaming. I have often wondered if I dreamed this memory and it has somehow been lodged deeply into my psyche.

Another confusing issue is that while playing with these artifacts I can say with certain probability that I was watching one of two possible cartoons: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Ghostbusters. If I were truly watching the latter it would be extremely plausible that I imagined this to such an extent that it became real. 
An additional instance of this happening was with my maternal grandmother. I had attempted to get her scared 3 times within a day saying that a snake had crawled under the front porch. On the forth time trying to scare her I ran outside and saw the body of a black snake slithering under the porch. I swore then and I could swear now that this snake had physically existed.

Thank you all for reading and any ideas you might have to share with me about this instance.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1a9ee0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1a9ee0/a_memory_of_a_figure/,
1362540614.0,16,self.Thetruthishere,19r4kk,[ME] Few experiences from my childhood,michimi710,18,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/19r4kk/me_few_experiences_from_my_childhood/,"So someone passed this subreddit to me today simply because he knows I enjoy reading this kind of stuff but for once this seems like a good place to post about what I have experienced. I have experienced a lot though so I will only post a few stories for now.

Background: Growing up, I used to live next to a cemetery (I know I know, cemetery...) for about the first 12 years of my life. The cemetery was traditionally quiet. Not many visitors though I remember thinking it was HUGE (from the eyes of a child). My room had two windows, one directly looking at the cemetery and another where you could see the backyard but the cemetery ran parallel to the backyard so you could still see a good amount of it.

The first experience that I can recall was that of a little boy. I was about six at the time and my brothers and best friend were getting ready to go outside and play. Through the window in the living room (which pointed out at the street) I saw this boy, my age, with one of those balls you buy at the supermarket (those small ball which were white and had cloud-like colors on them). He was alone and I thought hey, we should ask him to play with us! I went downstairs and was outside before anyone else. He looked sad I remember so I asked him if he wanted to play. He gave a big smile and I turned around to tell everyone he was going to join and when I turned back... he was gone.

Fast forward a few years, I was about nine or ten. My cousin who is two years older than and a friend who is my age were over. We were outside by the fence that divided the house and the cemetery. (Side note: The owner of the house I lived in was throwing out a couch so it was against the fence, when we stood on it, we could see over the fence). So, the three of us were looking out into the cemetery and I noticed this black man standing over a grave. I watched him for a while until he lied down on the grass. I was confused so I told my cousin and friend what I saw. They each proceeded to tell me they didn't see what I saw but they each were seeing different people. My cousin saw an old couple holding hands over a grave and my friend saw a lady in black walking down one of the aisles... needless to say we ran into the house pretty freaked out.

One day when doing hw in the kitchen (approximately age 7/8) I was sitting alone and when i looked up a saw this man. I didn't recognize him but he was sitting in front of me with a smile. He had a glass of what I recognized to be soda. He motioned for me to continue hw so I did and when I looked again he was gone. A week later at my aunts house I see the picture of the man on her fridge. I ask my parents who that is. Turns out it was my grandfather on the dad's side. He came to the US alone when he was in his 50's to try and make money to send back to Colombia to my grandma and my aunts and uncles and my dad. He died in the states alone. 

The last event i will talk about for now is this man I have seen since I was young. In recent years I have only felt his presence from time to time but I have not seen him since I was about 13 or 14 (I am 22 now). I can remember clearly what he looks like. He was black in a white tuxedo. He had a bowtie. And a top hat. Black shoes. And a very large smile. He gave me this friend type vibe. I never was afraid of him. Simply always curious. He has never spoken to me, only smiled. Everytime I see him I get this name, it starts with a ""C"" and I can't remember it right now. Contas. That sounds right. He has a very specific presence that I can always recognize but I've never quite understood why he's been present. 

I have a lot more. I will tell once I feel comfortable enough...

TL;DR Lived next to cemetery. Saw little boy - disappeared. Me and two others saw three different things looking into cemetery. Saw dead grandfather, didn't know it was grandfather until one week later. Seen/sensed presence of tall black man in a tuxedo since I was little.

My friends and i are deejays, to be specific, birthday and wedding deejays.

There was this place in Leeuwarden where a birthday party was held.

So upon arriving on the spot we were appointed to a stage. We set up our equipment, played our music, welcome the guests and everything.

On the left and right of that emergency door there where 2 dressing rooms.
There where no people in these rooms because we would have seen them, and even though some old stuff was lying there, no one would be able to hide in, or behind them (so the sighting was a real sighting).

My friends and i explored the whole area, and made the little place our home for the night

Before and during the setup and welcoming, my friends and i where in those rooms multiple times (exploring the area, answering phone calls and chilling and such) and there was no other person in the room besides me and the colleagues, and there are three of us.

The stage where we had to do our stuff, had a lot of curtains and probably was used as a stage for theaters.
In the center of the back of the stage, there was a small, 5 steps, stairs which led downstairs to a emergency door.

This emergency door was once opened by my friend and that set of an alarm.
So this door was prohibited, as told afterwards by the people who owned the place, from opening.

As deejays we prohibit people coming up to back of the stage.
There is no need for people to be over there.

Note that we don't do drugs and we do not drink.

On to the sighting: 

At a certain moment during the welcoming, it was my friends turn to deejay and i was derping in the back.

I was in the left room a few minutes and i saw nobody in the room, when i returned to the stage.

I was standing on the stage and all of the sudden i saw someone going from the left room, walking op the stairs, taking an immediate left (my left, his right) and walking a straight path to the left of the stage, when at the back wall he opened up a door (white door, and had a little black window on it.), and shut it.
I saw him from the beginning to the end.
(I made a horrible of the layout in Photoshop of the stage and the path the ghost guy followed, [This is the layout of the stage, it's photoshopped and it sucks, ](http://imgur.com/6mjocVf))
This door made a sound when it closed, like it was slammed shut but not very hard.

But it was hard enough for me to hear it.

I was baffled and immediately followed him to that door but i couldn't find any door.

My friend asked me what was wrong and i explained it to him, and he searched the back wall with me.

No door was found.

Unfortunately we didn't get to ask the people who owned the place because they where gone when we could ask them.

I have experienced more stuff.

1361302550.0,14,self.Thetruthishere,18u2oj,[FAM] My wife was visited by a ghost as a child [x-post from r/paranormal],jkingme,18,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18u2oj/fam_my_wife_was_visited_by_a_ghost_as_a_child/,"This happened to my wife when she was younger, but I've heard her tell the story so many times that I feel that I can accurately represent it here.

From the time she was about 4 years old until she was 8, she had a recurring nightmare that would happen every few months. In it, she was in her house (she lived in the country), and she felt an intense sense of urgency. She would run outside, and the house looked slightly different. It had a wrap-around porch in the dream, whereas there was no porch in real life. 

Once she got outside, there was an old man that took her by the hand and led her around to the back of the house. As they rounded the side of the house, she could see a tribe of Native Americans charging over the hill in the distance. They were running towards her, and they were all on fire, almost like they were made of flames.

When she turned back around from looking at the Native Americans, the old man was opening the cellar doors on the side of the house. He started walking down to the basement, and then reached his hand up for her to follow him. Every dream ended as she was looking down into the darkness of the basement. All she could see was his hand &amp; wrist sticking out.

So, one day when she was 8, she was at the neighbor's house (she babysat my wife and her sister when their parents were at work). The neighbor lady got to talking about my wife's house, and how there had been a fire at the house about 20 years before. She had an old picture of the house (a family photo in front of the house), and showed it to my wife. In the picture was the wrap around porch, which had later been destroyed in the fire.

Even creepier, though, is that the picture also showed the exact same old man that was in my wife's dreams. He looked exactly the same, and in reality he had died in his basement bedroom when the fire happened.

Ever since she found that out, the nightmares stopped.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_18u2oj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18u2oj/fam_my_wife_was_visited_by_a_ghost_as_a_child/,
1360949684.0,17,self.Thetruthishere,18l8ib,"So what started with curiosity on my own possible abilities, became an unearthing of some family history, long [FAM]",cinderfox,19,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18l8ib/so_what_started_with_curiosity_on_my_own_possible/,"Hello all,
This is my first post to site such as reddit so please forgive me if i violate i violate any rules. I have tried to read the rules but i am somewhat forgetful, especially with the excitement that fills me now. I found this subreddit yesterday while browsing the top links of /r/nosleep and read a little to keep me occupied at work. One post I read was of a supposed psychic and for whatever reason it stuck with me even though I personally believed it to be untrue. However, it still tugged at me when i woke up this morning, and for whatever reason i recalled several instances in which I have dreamt the future. Now when I say this, I don't mean anything like dreaming of the next president or world war, nothing of that sort. I mean trivial things such as dreaming of playing a game, then finding myself playing the same game, in the same exact scenario 4 years later. This game hadn't yet been created nor had I heard or seen anything about it before I had that dream. Also, apologies for making this post long but it is simply the way I write as I am a writer at heart. 

Well, originally after remembering these things, I thought i would post the above details here and see what you guys thought and if there was any way in which i could hone this ""ability"" if it is indeed there at all. However, as this morning progressed I increasingly grew more inclined to ask my mother if she believed in such a thing in the first place. Now, I have no idea why I asked the question I did, perhaps to simply jumpstart the conversation as I was a little embarrassed to be asking such a thing, but being a nosleep lurker I had asked her some time ago if she had any ghost stories or anything of the sort that she could tell me, that she personally believed of course, and asked her to tell me one such story now. However, I hadn't expected her to give me a personal account of one such story.

 Well, as it turns out, during her college years before she became a Christian and met my father, my grandmother opened a shop of her own nearby their home which just so happened to be a botanica (I dont know spanish so cant translate to english). She would do tarot cards, cleansings, and healings from what my mother told me. Being Christians, it doesn't seem like she likes to get into too much detail with the occult based on the way she told me. However, in those days, my mother believed my grandmother to be helping people and thought she would help my grandmother with her work. Well, as it turns out, my mother has somewhat of a ""gift"" for prayers and because of this, my grandmother decided to take her on a house call one day. I guess there were others that were with my grandmother and mother because she said that each person in their group had a specific role, my mothers being keeping prayer and never once breaking it. Well the house they went in to had an average size dining room which had a small hallway that led to the bathroom, the dining room being the place they performed the ritual. My grandmother made some sort of circle, and my mother would walk around the circle chanting the prayer. As my mother walked around the circle she would pass by the hallway with the bathroom, and she said that whenever she passed by it, she could feel something. After a number of times passing by it, she finally decided to open her eyes and sneak a glance at the hallway as she passed by.

 She said that for whatever reason there was a somewhat sizable gap from the floor to the bottom of the door, and the door was slightly open, but what caught her eye was the tips of someones boots beneath the door frame. Of course she thought it strange, but she assumed it to be someone from the house just listening in on them and kept on. However, as time passed she said she could see what seemed like the glow of fire from the door frame and by this time she was started to get a little spooked. It was only until smoke started spewing from the door that they thought a fire had broken out and starting calling 911 and calling for help. My mother thought of the man she saw behind the door (his boots i mean not his actual figure) and ran to the doorway trying to push it open to help whoever was inside. The doorway was locked and wouldn't budge in the slightest. She began to panic and ran outside to get help, someone must have noticed her distress because she was so frightened she couldn't speak anymore, only gesture. The man finally somewhat understood her and rushed in to help with whatever she was trying to ask for. Once they reached the doorway and started trying to bash it open, they could hear what sounded like the man on the other side rolling on the wall, perhaps trying to put the flames that enveloped him out.

 After some time, the door slammed open and  a ball of fire shot out, my mother described as somewhat like a backdraft except the opposite way......? It seemed like she got a little nervous and excited telling me so she had trouble placing her words properly and stuttered on several occasions. Anyways, the ball of fire shot out, grazed the man that had come to help's back(he was pushing against the door and was dropped backwards to the floor when the door slammed open), bounced off the walls a bit, then shot out the open door. The firefighters had finally come, but when they went to investigate the room, nothing was actually on fire. The spots where they assumed the man to had been  rolling on the wall, were covered in scorch marks, and for whatever reason the toilet had exploded. The spots it had hit on the wall were also scorched, and the mans wallet in his back pocket was burned to crisp(yes, only the wallet, not even his pants were burned). The firefighters found the toilet extremely strange as in most fires, the only things that survive are the toilet and bathtub. She was going to tell me another one that was supposedly the one that brought her to Christianity and truly showed her that God is the way, but she got a call from work(which is where we are now) and said shed tell me another time. They're going to be out in mexico from today till sunday later on, so ill see if i can get her to tell me on sunday and post it if its truly worth posting. Again, apologies for the long post, I most probably missed some details as my mind isn't quite firing on all cylinders at the moment, but I tried.

I don't know if these two events technically qualify as bilocation, but they were strange nonetheless, and nobody's been able to explain either of them. 

This is how they were told to me.

At the time of the first incident, me and my sister were home alone for a few days, as our mother was away visiting some friends. I was 13 or 14, which would have put my sister at around 18.

My sister was at home with her boyfriend, in her bedroom, which was on the top floor of our house. Her bedroom door was pushed shut but not completely closed, leaving a small gap. It was a weekday afternoon, and I was out with some friends doing whatever it was I did after school at age 14. 

My sister and her boyfriend both hear footsteps coming up the stairs, and they glimpse someone they believe is me walk past her door, blocking out the light, heading towards my room which was diagonally across the hall from hers. When my sister opened the door, nobody was there. I came home about 15 minutes later. Both my sister and her boyfriend were thoroughly creeped out by the event, and I didn't hear about it until some time later. 

On to the second incident. When my husband and I first were married, we rented this crappy basement suite with a really tiny bathroom. It was set up like this: when you stood in the shower facing the rest of the bathroom, the inward-opening door was immediately to your right, and the sink was immediately to your left. 

This particular early morning my husband is up getting ready for work. I have the day off, so I stay in bed snoozing. I wake up when he returns after his shower with a confused look on his face, asking me if I had just been in the bathroom.

He tells me that he'd been in the shower, with the bathroom door cracked open about an inch, when something suddenly blocks out the light. He looks up, and through the shower curtain (one of those see-through ones, that blurs everything but lets a lot of light through) he sees what he believes is me - a woman with long hair - stepping inside the bathroom, lean over the sink for a moment as if rinsing her hands or looking in the mirror, and stepping back out. He immediately peeked out from behind the curtain, but the door was still in the same position and did not appear to have moved. He thought that the whole thing was weird, but he didn't fully clue in that it wasn't actually me until he came back into the bedroom and found me fast asleep.

That wasn't the only strange thing that happened in that basement, but I will save those stories for another day.",,False,,t5_2sntx,1360818086.0,,,True,t3_18hu0t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18hu0t/fam_in_two_places_at_once/,
1360672314.0,13,self.Thetruthishere,18dhd7,[Me] I saw 'The Light' during a possible near-death experience while water tobogganing as a 10 year old.,terrygraeme,20,7,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18dhd7/me_i_saw_the_light_during_a_possible_neardeath/,"It was a cloudless, beautiful, summer's day on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. For my 10th birthday, my dad took me, my sister, some friends and some family to a nearby lake for some tobogganing and jet boating.

Dad had taken the jet boat out across the bay with a tobogganer. While he'd gone out my sister and I got into the water and swam out into the lake, trying to get across the bay to a little island.

I swam quite far and noticed the jetboat approaching. The boat plowed closer towards my sister and I.  The boat goes past.  I can see Charlene smiling at me from the toboggan, swerving towards me, waving, just to give me a bit of a fright.  Then, I'm underwater.  I've been tangled in the ski-rope and it has wrapped around my neck, through my mouth, dragging me deep.

This is the bit I remember most about the incident. I remember looking around up whilst underwater, seeing the rays of sun shining from above. I distinctly remember having thoughts of how warm the lake was, what a perfect day it was, how nice it was to be underwater, how beautiful everything was. Time slowed. Warmth. Peace. Love. Charlene's smile, slow motion, waving at me. The sound of water rushing in my ears. Summer. Nature. A blanket, a cocoon of bliss. 

I've never felt anything like this since - the best way to describe it could be an all-encompassing euphoric feeling of warmth and peace.  Was this 'the light' that people see when they die?  It was undeniably a life-changing event; I think of it as a defining point in my life, that inexplicably changed who I am.

I don't know how long I was under - it could have been hours but was most likely under a minute.  I'd inhaled water and been knocked unconscious and given concussion. There was a point that I came to and somehow I made it to the beach, gasping, screaming at the top of my lungs, spitting out blood and teeth and sand to find a large tear in my cheek. Surprisingly I didn't feel any pain at all. I was rushed to hospital and received stitches, and for several years after needed orthodontic work.  My sister escaped the incident unscathed.

Anyway... I'm older and wiser now.  In my younger years I'd been convinced what happened was some sort of spiritual encounter, seeing God, some sort of connection with heaven or the afterlife or whatever I was believing at the time. These days I'm a jaded 25 year old atheist and I'm pretty sure it was a release of DMT in the brain, as happens to people on drugs or on their deathbeds. Still, I'm no scientist. It could have been something else. 

*Actually it was a 'knee board' but toboggan will do.  A toboggan is like a sled for water that gets dragged at speed to keep it afloat.

Almost immediately upon moving in, I felt something eerie, but decided it was probably just a combination of homesickness and being in an unfamiliar place. However, it quickly became apparent that it was something else.

I started feeling like someone was watching me, and I could feel a definite presence in the room with me, mostly emanating from over near the window next to my closet. Even thinking about it gave (and still gives me) the chills. For the most part I just ignored the presence and went about my life as normal. I still got the chills occasionally and sometimes things would go missing. Since my room is incredibly small (and I mean tiny, the bed takes up most of the room) and I couldn't find the things after searching it several times over, I'm pretty sure that it was the ghost grabbing things. They were always important things or items that held sentimental value: my high school transcript, my pearl necklace, some barrettes that I had never even taken out of my jewelry box. I'd also hear footsteps above me, which I thought were mice or something since there isn't an attic above me, but they were definitely too heavy to be anything but human (any animal heavy enough to make footsteps like this probably wouldn't be able to get up on the roof.) This was when I started to really get scared.

About four or five months after moving in, we (my dad, step-mom, and I) started doing a lot of spring cleaning. My step-mom ended up finding little hidey-holes around the house while we were cleaning (she and my dad had just moved into the house about two years prior to me moving in with them) and there were a few trinkets in the hidey-holes. We found marbles, toy trucks, toy soldiers, and, creepiest of all, in my opinion, a baby rosary in a tiny little box. For the most part they just seemed like something a kid would hide while living there, but after finding that stuff I had wondered if maybe it was the ghost taking and hiding things.

Fast forward another month, and I woke up in the middle of the night because there was light in my room. I can't sleep if there's light in the room, so I always keep the blinds and curtains tightly shut and all of the lights off. I thought maybe it was my laptop or something, but no, my laptop was shut off. I noticed that the light was emanating from above my door, around where the ceiling connects to the wall. I then thought that maybe it was the windows letting light in, but even if there had been light coming from outside (there wasn't), there was no way that the light could have reflected up to that specific spot. It scared me a lot so I ended up turning on the ceiling light and reading instead of going back to bed.

More detail on the light: it wasn't really an orb, which I see ghosts described as pretty often. It was kind of like the light you'd see from the crack underneath a door, but it was in the seam between the ceiling and wall above the door. 

Later that same month, I ended up flying across the country to go to my grandmother's funeral. On the way to the airport, I started mentioning my experiences to my dad, and he looked at me a little bewildered and said, ""Didn't I tell you there was a ghost in the house?""

When I told him that, no, he hadn't told me about the ghost, he went on to tell me all about his experiences with the ghost. Apparently was already in the house when he and my step-mom moved in, and they're both very easygoing, kind people and didn't take offense to it. He told me that he talks to it sometimes, just says things like, ""I know you're here. I hope everything is going well,"" and friendly things like that.

He told me that really the only time he's felt afraid of the ghost was when he and my step-mom got into a huge two or three week long argument and the ghost started banging cupboards and stealing things. He said that he thought it was probably the high emotions and raised voices that set the ghost off.

Another time he saw the ghost was when going into the bathroom late at night. He opened the bathroom door and saw the silhouette of a man in the room, just a dark patch even darker than the rest of the room. He wasn't scared at all, and reached out to touch the dark patch, thinking it might have just been his eyes, but the air was definitely colder than the rest of the room. He flipped on the switch and nothing was there.

The thing that stuck out to me the most was him mentioning that he and my step-mom had been arguing in their bedroom late one night and suddenly my step-mom had stopped and pointed up at the doorway and there was a light emanating from where the ceiling and wall met right above the door. This gave me definite chills, because I hadn't yet mentioned to him that I'd had a similar experience. And now, upon thinking back to it, I'd gotten into an argument with my girlfriend the same night that I saw the light over my bedroom door, which makes me wonder if it was the heated emotions that brought it on for both of our experiences.

Recently I haven't heard or felt anything from the ghost. I ended up having to shove a desk into the tiny corner where I usually felt its presence (due to my room being so small, there wasn't anywhere else to put it) and I wonder if my putting a piece of furniture there disturbed it. Also, I was wondering if anyone else had had an experience with the light above the door, or if that might be unique to our household ghost.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_17xas1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/17xas1/mefam_glowing_light_over_doorfriendly_ghost/,

Love this sub-reddit as these types of things have always been a huge interest of mine. For the story to make sense, i'll build a little back story.

Way back when I was in Jr.High school, my Uncle passed away. He was probably one of the friendliest men i had ever met. He was heavily religious, but not in the pushy way. To me, it seemed like everyone in the world knew who he was. So many people showed up to his funeral that they couldn't fit everyone in the church. I don't have a ton of memories of him but I do miss him.

Years have passed now and we have moved on with our lives, and recently my grandpa has gotten rather sick. Parkinsons is a bitch. My grandma struggles to take care of him at home currently. One night, they were getting ready for bed. My grandpa was passed out already and my grandma was having trouble sleeping. She was up doing something (I'm not sure what) and when she came back to the room my grandpa was trying to get out of bed. He seemed worried. My grandma helped calm him down and explained it was just a dream or whatever and to go back to sleep but he was insistent that he get up. He kept looking at the corner of the room as if something was there. My grandpa started to get really frustrated with my grandma, he was convinced someone was in the room. He started saying that they needed to go see Bruce. That he wanted to see my Uncle (his son). My grandma explained that he had passed away several years ago. My grandpa got rather confused then and said ""No, Bruce is right there!"" and he pointed to the corner he seemed to keep trying to go towards.  With my grandpas illness I'm sure he barely remembers the experience. When I was told this story, it sent shivers down my spine. The more i thought about it though, the more comforted i felt with the idea that even in death, my uncle is still that great man, watching over the ones he loves.

My Grandma has stated that she has occasionally felt ""something"" in the place but never has been able to put her finger on it.

**EDIT** : So apparently i suck at story telling. Turns out a huge part of the story i missed was that my Grandpa had actually fallen out of bed that night.

This happened a little over 5 years ago. First I'll provide a little back story. I lived with my grandfather till I was 6 and after that next door, until he got older at which point I moved back in with him to spend the last few months I could with him. On Christmas eve of 2006 he went to the hospital where he spent his remaining months.  After he passed I continued living at his house and did so alone. One night while sleeping I woke up pretty late, it was after 2, and sat up in my bed. The lights where on in and the door was open. It was unusual that the door was open as I rarely if ever sleep with an unlocked door never mind open. After sitting up in bed I looked at the door way and seen my Grandfather. Confused ""I asked what are you doing here?"" (looking back I wish I would have said something different) after the words left my mouth I blinked and he was gone, the door was open, I was still awake and sitting up in my bed.

That sounds super dumb, I know. I attribute this occurrence to my grandma because I'd always been scared of going down into the basement near her washing machine (there was a big hole near it and I thought something lived down in that hole). 

So every now and then, I'll put a bunch of clothes into the washer and start the cycle. I'll come back a while later, and the lid will be up and the cycle will have stopped. And nope, I didn't leave the lid up accidentally. 

EXPERIENCE WITH DOG: In our upstairs bedroom (an extra room -- it's acted a guest room and a den -- now it's our bedroom), we were hanging out and watching TV. Our dog, Sake, was sitting with us, but then jumped down and hid in the corner and started whining. He was looking past me, even though I kept telling him to come to me and get in my lap (which he usually does willingly). He just sat there staring and whining, and he never does that. No one else was in the room with us.

STAIRWAY: I've felt the odd ""spooky feeling"" on our stairway, but one day I was going up and down the stairs, getting laundry to do, and my dogs were following me all over the house. I got the last bit of clothes and told the dogs, ""All right, guys, let's go downstairs!""

1350927223.0,17,self.Thetruthishere,11wkvf,I keep thinking I invited it here (additional information and update). [me],march-riever,18,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/11wkvf/i_keep_thinking_i_invited_it_here_additional/,"I posted my experiences [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/10tqit/i_keep_thinking_i_invited_it_here_mefamxpost_from/) almost three weeks ago.  Since then, my sister and I have discussed how I had forgotten to mention a couple of things in my original post.  I think part of the reason I inadvertently left them out was that I hadn't solidly linked them in my mind as causes of the disturbances-- I never felt like I had any strong evidence of a link, so I put them aside.  However, I think it is important to describe them to give you the most complete picture I can of all of our experiences.

First, I forgot to mention the arrowhead collection.  My great-grandfather (maternal) built a personal collection of several thousand Native American arrowheads in his lifetime.  Many of those arrowheads remain in our house in framed cases.  During the same time period in which my sister, as well as my ex-girlfriend (""T"") and I, had our scary experiences in the upstairs guest bedroom, many of the arrowhead cases were hanging on the wall of that bedroom.  When I returned to this house with my wife to temporarily stay here before we move again, I made sure to remove them from the walls and store them in the basement.  They are very heavy, and I was paranoid to sleep in the room with them for fear that they would fall off the wall one night and land on our heads.  It has definitely crossed my mind that a collection of so many items that have a history of their own and that originally did not belong to my family may not be good mojo for the house.  But, as I relayed in my first post, I am generally the skeptic of the family, so I just kind of left it at that.  No matter what, it is not really my choice to make-- my mom is owner of the house, and she and her siblings have an attachment to those arrowheads.

The second thing I forgot to mention is the ""handprint,"" if you can call it that.  During the same time period in which the spookiest events in the basement were taking place, I discovered it on the upstairs kitchen counter.  There was never any mystery where it came from- I had left a package of steak out on the counter and it had thawed before I had started cooking.  I turned the package over, and there was this pool of blood that was shaped like a handprint of sorts, except it had six ""fingers.""  I remember being surprised that so much blood could have been pooled under the package and surprised that the plastic on the bottom of the package could have channeled the blood into exactly that shape.  I thought it was spooky, but being a skeptic and knowing the immediate origin of the print, I never thought much more about it.  I took a digital picture of it before I cleaned it up, and sent it to my sister to show her the cool, spooky thing I had found.  In retrospect, the print takes on a more menacing character when I consider the idea that, though I know its immediate origin (and it wasn't just slapped down as a handprint), some other thing or some other force may have caused it to form or collect in exactly that shape.

When I sit here and summarize the events in the house over the years, I don't feel as cavalier as my younger self.  I still don't know what I would say is behind the disturbances in the house, but one thing is for sure-- I now operate with a much deeper sense of respect and care in regard to these issues.

In the past few years I've been experiencing deja vu on a daily basis. I started realizing that I remember the scenes from my dreams. So I started keeping a dream journal and sure enough every so often, I re-experience the scene. Lately however I've been having much...much creepier dreams. They have been telling me stories. I have no name for them. Recently I started hearing them outside my dreams. I asked them to leave. I ask them every time they talk to just leave me be. They just tell me they need me. I don't want to be needed. I want it to stop, I want it to go away so I can stop worrying. I'm scared guys, I really truly am scared.

I know I sound like an idiot. Like I'm just crazy and don't get enough sleep. But I have no history of any such things. I've even gone and gotten a sleep study done and nothing abnormal was found.

They always want to know the time. Like they're waiting for something. I tell them, they say thanks and ask again shortly after. It's really unnerving at times, especially when I'm ""alone"". In my dreams though, when they speak. It's warm, comforting and friendly conversation. I don't think I know them. I'll continue adding to this as I can.

1345360312.0,13,self.Thetruthishere,ygqs7,Strange things that happened in my old house,,21,8,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ygqs7/strange_things_that_happened_in_my_old_house/,"When I was around 8 years old, my parents and I moved into a small mobile home (since we couldn't afford anything else). It was very old for a trailer, we guessed it was around 20-30 years old.

The first 2 years I lived there, I felt fine, safe, happy, and healthy. But around the middle of the third year, things started to get weird.
I think it's worth mentioning that around this time, my aunt died, and soon after my great grandmother died in the same year. I'm not sure if this affects things at all. My mom was very close to these two.

Anyway, I can only remember bits and pieces, so I'll just type what I can remember.

(I think before I start I should mention that when we moved in, my parents found a death certificate and files describing the incident that caused it. They didn't read all of it because they didn't want to invade privacy.)

I believe the first things that started happening were constant nightmares. Some of the most disturbing, horrible dreams I've ever had, even to this day. Though, this could just be because I was having massive hormone changes due to early puberty. 

The next thing that started happening terrified me so much that I rarely slept in my bedroom. 
I started hearing strange noises at night. The feeling I got from these noises was strange- it was almost like how in a dream, you tend to overreact. Like in my nightmares, even the slightest strange thing I see will make me scream. When I heard these noises, I had an intense amount of fear and anxiety that would almost make my fight-or-flight instincts kick in. 
It was always so strange how I would be so afraid of these noises, especially since I was usually never afraid of anything (except for my nightmares at the time- sometimes I would force myself to stay awake until I passed out cold trying to avoid them). 
It was a different noise every night. A couple nights I remember hearing this strange series of ""beeps"", but nothing we owned in the house sounded like it. It was a different ""melody"" each time. One night, I heard the beeps again, but right after it stopped I heard very faint, brief, sinister laughing. It sounded like a man.
Another night I heard another very faint, brief sound reminiscent of a chainsaw hitting metal. It sounded like it was coming from behind my bed, but it was so faint and quiet that it almost felt like it was coming from my head.

That's all I can remember for the noises.

After the noises starting coming more often, I had more things happen to me. One night while I was sitting up, reading a book with my lamp light on, I suddenly felt the air get heavy and I felt like someone was behind me. I tried to ignore it... but then all of a sudden, I felt something push on my back so hard I almost fell out of my bed. It seriously scared me. 
One night, while I was trying to fall asleep, I had my small air-freshener-nightlight combo on which changed colors. (Just mentioning this in case the colors might have had some kind of effect on me, I was at risk for epilepsy and still am, and I had a seizure once as a baby) 
While I was trying to fall asleep, I had my stuffed animal lying next to me. I don't know if it was me being tired, anxious or paranoid, but I swear it looked like the thing was breathing. Its chest was moving up and down. Again, I ran out of my room to sleep in my parents' room.


Occasionally, my mom would mention that she felt a hand resting on her shoulder, even when no one was around. She also would wake up at 3:00am, on the dot, every night for a couple months. It didn't matter what time she went to bed, it was always 3am.

Almost all of the strange things that happened were in my room, and no other room in the house. Not even the bathroom connected to my room.
One of the only things I can think of that happened outside my room was my great grandmother's large, old snowglobe that played music which she used to have before she died. It was sitting on top of my mom's desk, and no one had touched it in a very, very long time. It was collecting dust. 
One night, out of the blue, with no one moving (except my mom typing on her keyboard) it chimed once. It had never done that before. I really don't know why it did.

Well, anyway, I can't really think of any other things that happened... but I do remember that one day around sunset, out of curiosity and anxiety, I decided to take a sound sample of my room when it was quiet. I do remember hearing something when I amplified the sound, but that could just be interference of some kind.

Whenever I was in my bedroom, day or night, I felt a horrible feeling of dread and fear. IF there was something in there, I feel like it certainly didn't want me there. Even my cats rarely went into my room.

I just think it's very strange that only I ever experienced this sort of stuff and no one else. It's weird that I felt a horrible feeling in my room but no one else did. And this continued until the shortly before the year we moved out. After that, I didn't feel anything anymore. No noises, no strange feelings, no fear. We had lived there for almost 6 years. Ever since then, I haven't had this experience.

I think it might be good to mention that there was an intense amount of stress in the house. My parents were fighting almost constantly and it got extremely bad. They never hit each other, but they shouted very loud and my mom had severe depression at the time and had to be hospitalized at least 3-5 times while we were living there. My ""father"" was very manipulative, controlling, and verbally abusive. We had to deal with the deaths in my mom's family, being extremely poor, having to constantly treat my mom's illnesses (which have vanished since we moved out), and my constant anxiety over everything happening. When we ""moved out"", we were actually kicked out by my mom's at-the-time husband and he asked for a divorce, over the phone, while my mom was in the hospital for her depression. We later found out he was cheating on her.

Anyway, if anyone could help me figure out what might have been happening there, I would be very grateful. My mom's side of the family has had a history of this kind of strange stuff happening. 

Since the time my aunt was born, whenever they would take pictures of her and printed them out, there was always this little white ""spiral"" in the picture near her. It happened with every camera they used. It didn't matter what brand, type of camera, or house she was in when the picture was taken. It was always there. And after she died, it was gone.

When my mom was little, she lived in an old farmhouse. She said that at night she would hear a bouncy-ball bouncing down from my aunt's room, but when her and her mom went to investigate the noise, my aunt was sleeping and there was no ball.

1344571258.0,15,self.Thetruthishere,xz9vr,A few of my own personal experiences with ghosts...(long),existinginacrisis,21,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/xz9vr/a_few_of_my_own_personal_experiences_with/,"I've always been a believer in ghosts. I have had several experiences throughout my 24 years here on earth that only furthered my belief. None of these experiences I am about to tell are particularly scary, but 100% true none the less. 

This is my first time writing about any of my experiences, so please forgive me if I get a bit long-winded in my explanations (being an aspiring writer I tend to go overboard on details occasionally).

The first experience I remember is a pretty hazy one, so much so in fact, that I'm no longer sure if it actually happened, or if it was just a dream. I maintain that it actually happened. It is also the only experience that I have never spoken of before now.

When I was about 4 or 5, I was living with my parents and siblings in an old house in Maine. My sister (2 years my junior) and I shared a room on the second floor at the back of the house. There was a small door in the corner of the room that led to a small balcony-like area in the barn that was attached to the house. The door was small, much like one you would see leading to a crawl space, and seemed the perfect size for my sister and I. My bed was closest to this door, something I was never comfortable with but didn't have an explanation for my discomfort at the time. I always felt most comfortable if I was laying in bed facing the door, afraid that something or someone would come through it without me seeing it. 

One night I awoke, and felt compelled to get out of bed and go out into the barn through the little door. To this day, I don't know why I actually did it. I climbed out of bed and went to the door, opening it slowly as to not make a lot of noise and wake my sister. The barn was eerily quiet, and I could see a strange white glow coming from the ground floor in the center of the barn. I crept slowly toward the edge of the balcony until I could see what was causing the light and, looking back now, was surprisingly unphased by what I saw. 

Standing in the middle of the barn was a figure, I couldn't tell of it was male or female, that seemed to be made completely of light. They were almost see-through, yet solid at the same time. The figure was just standing with their arms raised above their head, facing the ceiling of the barn with their eyes closed. Almost as soon as I saw the figure, I felt compelled to go back to bed. Without reacting to what I was seeing at all, I slowly backed my way back into my bedroom. As soon as I shut the door the fear hit me and I made a running leap into my bed and hid myself under the blankets. It took me a bit to fall back to sleep, bit eventually I did, making sure I didn't turn my back to the door.

I never told my parents about what I saw, or anyone else for that matter. It was the only time it happened, and I never felt scared of the barn. My fear of having my back to the door as I slept never went away, however. I also never had any other experience of that nature in that house.

Most of my other experiences occurred later in life, in a different house. My family moved a bit during my childhood, the separation of my parents when I was 6 being a major cause, but none of the houses either parent moved to seemed to have any paranormal activity. 

My mom remarried when I was 8 and we moved into a house in Vermont, where we would remain for the rest of my school career, and where I eventually moved back to after my mom and step-dad moved back to Maine.

 It was in that house where I would have several more experiences. Here they are, not necessarily in chronological order. 

First, I must say that I maintain that the Vermont house had two, very separate energies haunting it. In the living room I could feel a calm, somewhat somber energy that was definitely female. The house is known as the Winn House, built in 1825, and I believe the female ghost is that of Mary Winn, whom the house is named for. The other energy was somewhat darker, not bad but not very good either, and it was definitely male. Maybe Mary Winn's husband, although I'm not sure if she ever married. The second ghost made a habit of lurking in the kitchen/dining room (my parents remodled the two rooms when I was a senior in high school, swapping their locations), and also seemed to retreat into the indoor porch-turned-laundry room off the master bedroom, which was next to the kitchen/diningroom. 

My sister and I initially shared one of the two bedrooms upstairs, my brother (6 years my senior) in the other. I never experienced anything in the room I shared with my sister. When my brother moved away to college, I moved into his room, needing more privacy as I was getting older and coming into puberty, and couldn't stand my sister at times. 

It was in this room where I started experiencing thing I could not explain. It was usually small things, like objects being in different places than where I had initially put them, sometimes things disappearing for weeks at a time, only to appear exactly where I had left them. It unnerved me, but I never felt threatened by any of it, so I just shook it off. As I grew older, the more I opened myself to it, the more I experienced. 

I am still unsure if the energy in my bedroom was that of one of the two ghosts downstairs, or of a separate entity entirely. When I went away to college, I was convinced that the energy from my room followed me to Michigan, where I went to school. I could always feel a familiar presence, but never experienced what I had at home. I always played it off and spoke of it as my imaginary friend whom I had dubbed 'Francis'. It seemed fitting for some reason. 

When I was in high school, I got a job working at a local ice cream parlor. Working the second shift, I usually didn't get home until around 11 or 12 at night. One night I came home and my parents had gone to bed, and my sister was upstairs asleep as well. 

When you walk through the front door, immediately in front of you is a door that leads to the stairway going to the second floor, to the left is the kitchen/diningroom, and to the right is the livingroom.

I shut the front door quietly behind me, trying to avoid waking up our dog who was sleeping in my parents bedroom. I shut the porch light off that my mother had left on for me, and plummeted myself into darkness. As I reached for the door to go upstairs, I heard a loud whisper from the livingroom. I was extremely creeped out- one, because no one in the house was awake *or* in the livingroom, and two, because of what the whisperer said. My name. It was a quick ""Leah!"" Without responding to it at all, I ran upstairs to my room and got ready for bed as fast as I could.

Another experience I had was when I was sitting in the livingroom watching a baseball game one summer night. My parents had gone to bed and my sister was upstairs in her room reading. All of a sudden, the whole room started smelling of a strong flowery perfume, as if someone had doused themselves in it and sat down right next to me on the couch. The smell lingered for about 10 minutes, and then dissipated as quickly as it had come about. 

(A quick side note, the TV did not have a remote and had be shut off manually. We had two remotes, one for the cable box, and one for the stereo, both of which lay on the coffee table a few feet in front of me.)

When the game was over, I stood up and reached for the remotes to shut things down. When my hand was inches from the stereo remote, all three devices, TV, cable box, and stereo, shut off simultaneously. This undoubtedly freaked me out, so I quickly turned around and turned off the lamp that was behind me and went upstairs. 

The next day I told my mom about what had happened, and she told me that she had not experienced the electronics being shut off, but that she had smelled the perfume one time, and it was exactly as I had described it to her. She also had a few isolated experiences in that house, and she and I were the only ones to ever experience anything. 

I always felt like there was someone in the livingroom with me, most when I was alone, but I could feel the energy even if other people were there with me. Sometimes I could feel someone pacing back and forth in the far end of the livingroom, other times it was as if someone was sitting on whatever couch I wasn't on (we had two). In the instances when I felt them on the opposite couch, it was a very relaxed feeling, like they were just joining me in my television watching. 

The weirdest experience I had was during my junior year of high school. I was up in my room watching Law&amp;Order:SVU on my tiny 13"" television. I was seated on the foot of my bed, my window was open, my lamp on my nightstand next to the bed was on, and the tv remote was next to the lamp. My sister was already asleep in her room across the hall.

I *BLINKED*, and when I opened my eyes, my entire atmosphere had changed. I was *tucked* into my bed, laying on my back (which is something I never do because I can't sleep in that position), my window was closed, the light and tv were shut off, and the remote, as I found later, was across the room under my desk. And it was *4 hours later*. It scared the shit out of me. I didn't know what to do, and I didn't want to wake my parents up over something I didn't fully understand, so I just forced myself to fall asleep. 

To this day I cannot explain what happened. I asked my mom if maybe she had come upstairs and did anything, maybe I had fallen asleep and didn't realize it, but she said she had not been upstairs for a few days, let alone that night. I don't really think it had anything to do with ghosts, and aliens were my next best guess. I have no idea. 

A couple years ago, I had been moved out for a few years and my (now ex)girlfriend and I were staying at my parents house dogsitting while my parents were visiting my grandmother up in Maine. We arrived at the house, dropped our bags off inside and brought the dog out to the car because we were going into town to take him for a walk through a park and cemetery (one of our favorite pastimes). As we were getting him into the car, we both turned toward the livingroom window, where we saw a face looking back at us. It was an old woman who stood just in front of the window, leaning toward it as she watched us. When she saw us look at her, she backed away from the window and disappeared. My ex and I just looked at each other, not needing to say anything to know that we had both just seen the same thing.

A couple years later (this past year in fact), my parents had moved back to Maine and my current boyfriend and I rented the house from them. When I moved back into the house, the feeling of their presence seemed to increase. The energy in the diningroom felt much stronger, but only when my boyfriend wasn't home (he has a strong energy himself and I feel like it repelled the ghost). When I sat on the couch in the livingroom that was against the front wall, I could see into the diningroom, and usually felt someone standing in the diningroom looking into the livingroom. I usually made it a habit to not sit on that couch because the constant feeling of being watched unnerved me slightly. I also was uncomfortable walking through the diningroom when the lights were off, always unnecessarily rushing through it if I was home alone.

Despite all the experiences I had in that house, I never felt threatened by the energies in it. I always made a point of making my feelings about their presence known to them, letting them know that I didn't mind sharing the house with them as long as the didn't frighten me. The year I lived there with my boyfriend was fairly uneventful, but I could feel them constantly. 

One day a friend of ours was over, and he and I started talking about ghosts. Before I told him anything about my experiences, I took him on a walk-through of the house to see what he could pick up. He hit every nail on the head, from the sexes of the spirits to the locations of high activity. I told him of my experiences and he didn't seem surprised in the least. 

The creepiest part about our conversation was when he stopped mid-sentence, looked directly at me and said ""they're here for you."" He then said that what he meant was that they felt protective of me. I had grown up in that house, and they felt a connection to me that drew them toward me. I was always the one who experienced the most, and it was most likely because they could sense that I was the most open to the idea of them. 

We moved out of that house a couple months ago, and the house we are in now has not presented me with any ghostly energies.

[ME],thingsthingsthings,16,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ulh3l/flying_hairbrush_i_have_no_explanation_for_this_me/,"This is my first post in this subreddit. I shared this over at /r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix a few months back, but I think it's more appropriate here.

I was in middle school and my mom had recently passed away. It was morning, and my father had just left for work. I was alone in the house.

I was in my PJ's and brushing my hair with a round black brush that had a purple and teal handle. I walked from the kitchen to the front door so that I could step outside for a second to check the temperature so I could pick out the best clothes to wear.

On the way to the door, I set the brush down on an armchair at the edge of the living room. I stepped out onto the porch and heard a bang come from the living room.

I came back inside and I found the brush on the floor...on the other side of the room. No less than 14 or 15 feet away. It was as if someone had picked it up &amp; tossed it at the far wall. Not a single person was home (beside me), and the cushion that I'd placed the brush on didn't have any kind of springs that could have popped to eject the brush that far.

15 years later, still no explanation.

Hence, the throwaway. It is difficult for me to speak about this and I feel this sub-reddit has given me an opportunity to do so, without the judgement and repercussions of doing so offline. I feel like I would be deemed insane or at least troubled. I have never taken drugs in my life.

Let me start from what I believe is the beginning. I was 15 at the time and hanging out with some friends at the playground in our neighborhood. We lived in an upper/middle-class county, so most of the things that would have entertained us cost money that we didn't have, so we spent our time loitering where we could; simply goofing off and making our fun.

The neighborhood we lived in had nature trails that began next to the playground and snaked every which way with exits occasionally at subdivisions. One night, we decided to play manhunt on the trails. For those of you that don't understand the game of manhunt, it is basically a team vs. team game in which one team must find the other.

This is not the basis of my story. This story shorter, I ended up by myself. Searching down the trails that I knew, I was confident without a flashlight. I knew that of course, one of the opposing team could be standing just off the trail and watch me go by. But, I knew the guys that were playing wouldn't see that as fun or fair, especially in our group. I had just given up searching down a particular trail and was heading back when the air fell unnaturally silent. I stopped and listened hard, kneeling as slowly as I could. 

This is when it happened. A small ringing began in my ears. I'm not sure if this happens to anybody else, but I feel like the more you focus on a ringing in your ears, the louder it gets. This time though, it didn't work that way. I focused, expecting the ringing to get louder, then I'd get a small headache which would subside a few moments later. I felt it was small annoyance, seeing as I was listening for someone moving. But the small ringing continued. I listened to it for a minute or two, waiting for it to subside when suddenly I saw a bright white light.

I was on the ground, face-up. My friends were standing over me, several of them beaming flashlights over me. They told me that they had found me laying in the middle of the path, not moving. One of them had gone for help, while the others stayed with me. I was shocked, trying to shake it off as nothing in front of the guys, but I was ice-cold and drenched in sweat.

I have not been the same since that night. 

It began small in the weeks following. I would be out somewhere and I would have to stop because I would..feel something. I can only define it as a lurch of my stomach and followed by a feeling. Defining the feeling as an ""emotion"" would be too simple. I would feel...a moment of time. A moment of time that was not the one I was in.

For example, my father is a fireman and works in the city of Atlanta, Georgia. He is an EMT (emergency medical technician) and usually responds to calls in which someone is seriously injured. He defines himself as someone who keeps you alive until the ambulances arrive. 

One day, my mother and I went to visit him at work. At this time, I believe I had just turned 16 a few weeks previous (the incident in the woods having happened a few months prior). We were bringing him some home-cooked meal my mother knew he would appreciate. We got to the station and found out that he was on a call. We waited in the small station-house kitchen for him to return. After a while we heard the engine pulling in.

I got up, excited to go see the engine pull into the giant hanger, to see my dad hanging to the side of the firetruck in uniform, so I figured I would wait in the bay for him. But on the way to the door, I slowed. My stomach lurched up and I felt dread. True, undeniable dread. I could feel the color drain from my face and I had to grab at the counter next to me. At this moment I felt something. I could feel a man. He was uncertain, but determined. I smelt..rust? Exhaust. I stumbled into the microwave on the counter and nearly fell to the floor. My mother managed to catch me in time and pulled me upright. She was asking me what was wrong, but I could barely hear her. I felt a rising,  then let out a sudden uncontrollable scream. And as abruptly as I began, I stopped. I felt empty as my mother held me up as I stumbled back to the chairs we had just been sitting in. 

My father and his crew came in a few moments later. My mother explained what had happened and my father immediately checked me. He couldn't find anything wrong with me. As they watched me in the chair I could hear them talking. The call my father had just returned from was a man that had jumped in front of the inbound Marta train coming in to the city. The police and a crowd that had gathered had tried to call him back from the tracks. He had seemed hesitant, but was too late to change his mind. He was screaming as he stood on the tracks.

I am 22 now and I have had hundreds of moments like this. Each time I have tried to track the feelings to a source event, but rarely have had anything confirmed to a tee. I know I must be close to where it has happened or close to someone who has witnessed it. I do not believe I am crazy, but have often thought of seeking help from a therapist in dealing with what I feel. I'm sorry if this was poorly written, but it is the best I could do.

I am interested in what all of you think of this and hope that you are not quick to judge me. I will try to answer any questions you have.

[ME],IMonCRACK,26,9,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tisbz/a_peculiar_encounter_with_a_ufo_me/,"This is basically a crosspost from /r/nosleep from about a year ago when I didn't know this subreddit existed. I just fixed some spelling mistakes. I was never sure if it would be appropriate here, so I never posted. This happened to me around a year or two ago. If this is not allowed, then the mods can feel free to remove it. I just want to get it off of my chest again with a different community than /r/nosleep. I thought ""Whats the worst that can happen"" so here it is:

I go outside at night for a cigarette and like looking at the stars. So I start watching some ufos, (I see them every time I actually go outside) and I really focus on one, which is moving very erratically). So after about 10 minutes I start getting images. These images weren't in my mind, they were covering my vision, so I had to look at the sky to really see the details, which were AMAZINGLY detailed. 

They are pulsating images, the same exact color as if you stare into a light for 5 seconds and then close your eyes. It looks exactly the same. Anyway I would get these pulses, slowly coming from the outside and ending in the center of my vision. It would get clearer as it nears the center. Now, if you look up telepathy, it will tell you that what I just described is exactly what happens (i looked it up afterward and nearly shit myself). So I get these weird images, about 5 in all the first time, over a course of about 10 minutes. I would get around 1 minute per image, about a pulse every 5 seconds. 

So after this happened once, about 2 weeks later it happened again. and I got about 5 images again, but this one was very freaky. It was the evolution of humanoid type things, maybe humans. It started off as ape looking creatures, moved on to how we look today, than kept going farther and slightly resembled a type of alien. I only got faces, and it sort of looked like grey aliens facial features, but not giant egg shaped heads. It was weird. I know this sounds retarded and that I'm making it up, but I swear to you fine people that I'm not. Theres no reason for me to make this up, as people just call me insane.

[First Update to intial response]

Alright, first heres some of the images I saw. Very crude mspaint drawings so bear with me.

http://i.imgur.com/m53ee.png 

The First image was very similar to this, but you couldnt see arms, only what looked like hands. http://l.thumbs.canstockphoto.com/canstock0802116.jpg 

The second one was a stone tablet like this

http://www.michael-j-kelly-photography.com/uploads/processed/0918/0904261349121img_0577edu.jpg 

and had pillars on either side similar to this

The third image I got I tried very hard to draw it right after the incident, but I just couldnt. it was a confusing symbol. So I searched ""alien symbol"" on google images and this popped up.

http://i.imgur.com/n6P0U.jpg

It was similar to that. I dont know how similar, but when I saw that image it brought me back to what I thought I saw.

Ok enough of the pics, another story now. So about 2 months ago, I again go outside to watch my UFO buddies (they really like entertaining me for some reason) and stare at one in particular of course, then I start to get the pulses. 

So I concentrate and am getting this beautifully detailed image of looks like a large explosion. I could not for the life of me figure out what it was, the detail, the way it went upward out of my vision, it was like a real time perfect view of a nuke. Mushroom cloud and everything. So I couldnt figure it out and went back inside and back on reddit. I reload the front page (this was at like 3 am btw) and what do I see? The ANIVERSARY OF THE HIROSHIMA BOMB. That kind of freaked me out, because when I thought about it, it was exactly what i saw. I dont know why the hell someone would send that to me, but they did.

This happened before I was born, so cannot really confirm any of it. However, my mother does not have a reason to lie to me about what happened.

In the 60’s, my mom’s husband at the time got some job on a ranch (not sure about the details here). Part of the perks of the job was they got to live in one of the houses on the ranch for free. It was an old, three story building what was pretty decrepit (I believe on whole wing was inaccessible because it had collapsed). My mom loves old houses, so she was not put off by the condition of the house.

The story about the house seems very “urban legend” and a little cliché to me, but this is what she says happened.

Apparently, back in the olden days, there was a family by the name of Winters who were very wealthy. The daughter, Nettie, fell in love with a ranch hand. The father found out, Nettie and her sister-in-law were sent on a trip to Europe, Nettie comes home to find the ranch hand gone, later finds out ranch had was murdered by father, locks herself in her room and dies of a broken heart. In typical ghost story form, before Nettie died she cursed her family. Subsequently, within a year her father was trampled by one of his prize-winning race horses, one brother dies in one of those new-fangled automobiles, another brother died in a mine collapse, and the mother goes insane (the family locked her away in a glass room located on the third floor). Only the sister-in-law was spared.

My mom claims to have a lot of experiences in the house. Every day at exactly noon the pantry door would open. She would even try to put heavy objects in front of it, but it would still manage to open. The rocking chair in the glass room would rock on its own (there were no windows in the room). She had a séance in the glass room (this was the 60’s) and the all candles blew out. Typical haunted house stuff.

One of the stories involved my step-sister who had strep throat. Apparently, she was running a really high temperature and my mom called the doctor (they did house visits back then). The doctor was very concerned about my step-sister and felt if her temperature got any higher she would have to go to the hospital. My step-sister, in her delirium, heard a woman with swishing skirts and high heels put a cold hand on her forehead and say, “You can get up in a few minutes, you are fine now.” My step-sister gets up in a few minutes, goes downstairs, the doctor is still there, and checks her out. She was completely well. My step-sister thought it was my mom who had told her that, but my mom was wearing cowboy boots and jeans.

The best story of the house is that Nettie’s room was apparently locked and no one had the key. One morning, my mom got up and found the key on her dresser. She unlocked the room and everything was just as if Nettie still lived there. Clothes were in the closets, the bed was made (with an indentation), no dust bunnies, it was perfect.
When my mom had to move out of the house, she was unpacking at the new place and found a purse she never used. In the purse was the key to Nettie’s room and a handkerchief with N. Winters embroidered on it. She lost both of these in other moves, much to my chagrin. 

I visited the house when I was a teenager. It was all boarded up, but it was on the historical registry, so it might still be there.

Edit: FTFY http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Winters_Ranch/Winters_Mansion

Edit 2: I also found this, which discounts the ""curse"" story. However, I was surprised to see there actually was a Nettie Winters. http://www.wintersexpress.com/historyofwinters.html

1336548850.0,15,self.Thetruthishere,tee3e,[DIS] Ever spent time with the recently deceased? Anything strange happen immediately afterwards?,Maghook,15,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tee3e/dis_ever_spent_time_with_the_recently_deceased/,"Not sure if appropriate for this subreddit so let me know, but I was just wondering if anyone had any stories to share. I'll start. Sorry if it's a little long-winded. It's not supernatural in nature, so I apologise.

I was admitted to hospital years ago with a chest infection. I'm a frequent visitor. Hospitals are basically my second home and I find them relaxing, simply because they're so isolated and quiet. The smell of disinfectent is intoxicating.

During this stay, the first day of my admission, I was placed in a shared room with three other people. Usually I get a private room, but not this time. I was probably the only one in the room under the age of 60. I don't believe anyone else was there for respiratory issues, even though it was a respiratory ward.

So I carry out my hospital routine. Read books, watch TV, take naps when nurses aren't poking and prodding me. Eventually dinner comes around and I look at it for a while trying to figure out if I want to eat it or not. Then I go to sleep.

I wake up a couple times during the night, nurses are walking around the room in the dark. I figure they're just doing their usual rounds, but they're focusing quite intently on this one male patient across from me. During the previous day he was soiling the bed quite often and nurses had to clean him up. They pulled the curtains shut. I figure the same thing had happened, so I go back to sleep.

I wake up again as the nurse turns on the light across from me and I see a few people enter the room in casual dress, sobbing softly. They must be his family. I don't know what time it is, I'm known for sleeping in until lunch time, maybe I did the same again. I'm disoriented and check my phone, it's around 4:00 in the morning.

Then this woman starts crying hysterically. Wailing loudly in a foreign language. She must have been his daughter, though she herself was at least 50 years old. At this point I realise the old man must have passed away some time ago.

The next few hours are spent with an assortment of family and friends coming to say their final goodbyes before he's taken away to what I can only imagine is the hospital's morgue. Except, he isn't, at least not right away.

I ate breakfast only a few metres from this now deceased man. Then I ate lunch. It was sort of off-putting but I wasn't disgusted or creeped out. I just accepted the fact that it was his time. I don't know why it took the hospital staff as long as it did. I saw them wheel his body out in a bag. I didn't feel anything. Just curious I guess. At least it didn't seem like he suffered.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_tee3e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tee3e/dis_ever_spent_time_with_the_recently_deceased/,

1332771731.0,15,self.Thetruthishere,re7qp,Multiple Occurences I've been witness to (ME + FAM),NinjahNizz,18,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/re7qp/multiple_occurences_ive_been_witness_to_me_fam/,"Originally posted this on an Askreddit thread but it got buried quite heavily so going to repost both my sets of personal stories here.

The first story happened one night after a night on the town, I was exhausted when I came home, so I collapsed into bed only stopping to get out of my clothes and fell asleep within seconds, my only thought being, hey, at least I get a lie in tomorrow. So fast forward a few hours, it was about 5am, the sun just starting to come up, and I'm woken from my slumber by what can only be described as a high pitched ringing noise, like an alarm clock. So I was laying there for a good ten minutes thinking that maybe someone elses alarm in the house had gone off and they were just sleeping heavily. Then it hit me through my sleep addled mind, it was Sunday, noone in my house had work today.

A few more minutes passed without it stopping and I start to realise the sound is coming from much closer by, it just wasn't very loud, infact, it's coming from the cabinet under my bed. So I get down off the bed, and look around underneath. Under there is where all my old toys from when I was young are kept, mostly so when my niece and nephew get old enough they can have them. But I could hear the ringing much more clearly now, so I drag the box from the furthest back out of the cabinet and rummage through to near enough the bottom, and there it is, an old watch that I used to wear when I was around 7, and hadn't been seen or touched in about ten years (and with a very dead battery I might add, literally none of the buttons did anything, no display, nothing) was somehow ringing it's alarm, continuously.

Now at this point, I was too annoyed at being woken, sat on the floor half naked having to fish out this old toy watch to think much of it. I pulled open my window and threw the watch into the rain, and with a splash heard it hit a puddle. Pulling the window closed though, I could still hear it ringing before it shut. Strange enough, a dead battery and flooded with water and it's somehow still alive. But I went back to bed.
The next morning (I was 19 at the time, still living at home), my mum asks me why one of my old toys was on the ground outside, so I explain. So she wanders into the kitchen and brings back the watch. It's still ringing. Dead battery, outside in the rain all night, and thrown off the second floor of my house. I still can't explain how, or why after so long it had suddenly done what it did.

Second story, our house is fairly old, and we always joke that we have a slightly attention seeking ghost in it, the microwave goes crazy periodically for example. We didn't think much of it, except there were two things that happened that gave us the chills. The first, one day my mum woke up to find my old yellow Gameboy brick and my Gameboy colour (neither of which i use anymore) out of the cabinet drawer where they usually are and up on the side. A few questions later, we find that not a single one of us had moved them. Still unexplained. The other occured in two parts. My niece (Age 3) ran down to our living room at the front of the house, the light in there was off at the time, and a few moments later we hear a scream, she runs back to us crying she saw a 'creepy person' in there, we check, noone there.

Move forward a few months, I'm stood downstairs maybe about 2am at the other end of the house, when I hear a noise down the hall where the living room is. Looking over I see a shadow, but a blink later it's gone. Steeling myself, I walk in there, to find one of the curtain ties swinging back and forth, never getting any lower or slowing. I stood transfixed for a few minutes, 'til it suddenly went limp, as if someone had been sat by it swinging it and decided to stop. The kicker? The house owner before us was a strange, crazy old lady who had installed locks on every single downstairs door, and used to insist on sleeping in that very room. None of us know why, we just know she did.

Next story, I came downstairs once when family was visiting, and was immediately told by a very spooked looking group of relatives that they'd just seen a ghost. Apparently someone had walked down the entryway that runs along the side of our house. They hadn't walked back down, and nor had they gone through the gate at the end. Now just to clarify something, if you were to stand directly behind the gate and reach through the wall into the house, the first thing you'd come into contact with is the wireless printer directly next to the wall, sat on a desk. I was told that after this figure had walked down the entry, the sound of footsteps suddenly stopped behind the gate (they're very clear when you're in the house, it echoes a little so you always know if someone walks down), and upon reaching the gate, the printer, devoid of power had managed to start flashing its lights and whirring its rollers. It was neither turned on or plugged in. This struck me as one of the most bizarre occurences purely because a) several people had witnessed both the figure moving past the window along with the printer going mad and b) my dad also said he saw and couldn't explain it (he being incredibly skeptical and not believing in any sort of paranormal force in any form).

One more, this one didn't occur at the same house but I did witness the aftermath. My sister was at the time dating her now-husband, who had a child from his first marriage. This child of about 6 years by that point had complained and cried about hating sleeping at that house, as she said a strange man kept coming into her room and watching her, walking around her bed. Strange enough, but could be put down to night terrors and bad dreams. So finally the day comes when he and my sister decide to move out of that house for pastures new, I go along to help them pack up some of their stuff, along with my mum and other sister. What we find when we enter the house is a strong smell of cigarette smoke (neither he nor my sister smoked). 

As if this wasn't odd enough, I step into the bathroom to take a leak before I start helping, and freeze in the doorway as I find a ton of their stuff piled into the bathtub. And I don't mean 'moving out and needed somewhere to put some stuff' piling, this stuff had not been there when my sister and her boyfriend had left. Just a couple of cushions, one of the wooden snakes from their fireplace, a wash basket, underwear, shirts, a kitchen pan and even a DVD had somehow found it's way into a pile in this bath tub. Needless to say we hurried the hell up with packing and got out of there.

1331813490.0,14,self.Thetruthishere,qxo8a,"[FAM] ""You look like you've seen a ghost!""",London-Lass,16,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/qxo8a/fam_you_look_like_youve_seen_a_ghost/,"My mum is now retired but used to work as a housekeeper to a (wealthy) family in St John's Wood.  She was appointed by the family to work for them in Essex and, when the family moved to London, my mum’s salary was doubled (with all transport paid for) so that she would continue in their employ.

The house the family moved into in St John's Wood was a relatively old (and rather grand) townhouse on lower ground, ground and three upper floors.  After moving in, the family quickly set about refurbishing the house internally using the skills of an interior designer and a trusted firm of building contractors.  And, it was during these works, that odd things began to happen.

I remember my mum chatting to me one evening about the house’s alarm.  Whilst the family were holidaying abroad the alarm had gone off in the evening on a couple of occasions (long after my mum had left the premises).  One son had remained in the UK (he had his own place) and, aside from him and my mum, no-one else had access to the house whilst the family were abroad.   As a registered keyholder the alarm incidents were reported back to the son who would visit the house but never find anything amiss.  The alarm company apportioned the blame on my mum (being the last person to leave the house) for failing to set the alarm correctly (which caused my mum some concern).  Shortly after the family returned, they arranged for a representative from the alarm company to visit the house to check out the alarm and, during his visit, my mum ran through her routine of setting the alarm which was correct.  In addition, the alarm company representative could not find anything at fault with the system and, on being asked what else might have caused it to activate, did mention that a marked change in temperature *might* be a possible trigger.  

Another time my mum said that both her and the lady of the house were in the ground floor study.  The study housed shelves of books which my mum and the lady of the house were going through, dusting and replacing, whilst up on ladders at opposite ends of the room.  Between the two lay a vacuum cleaner, plugged into the wall, that my mum had left just before commencing the book dusting.  Whilst getting on with their task my mum and the lady of the house were making small talk (with their backs to each other) and, during their chit-chat, my mum remembers suddenly hearing the vacuum cleaner start up.  Thinking the lady of the house had come down from her ladder to commence vacuuming she carried on book dusting, only to hear the lady of the house suddenly call over to her, whilst still up her ladder!  My mum said that they both looked down at the vacuum cleaner whirring away on the floor between them unable to figure out how it had switched itself on.

On the second floor of the house lay the guest rooms.  These were rarely used but were cleaned regularly with bedding changed and washed on a fortnightly basis.  Each guest room had been decorated in different colours - peach, pink, yellow and blue - and it was the `blue room’ where a few incidents were reported.  Most of the time my mum worked alone in the house and, whilst working, she would often switch on the kitchen radio to keep her company.  On a few occasions, after finishing her work and switching off the radio, my mum would realise that she could still hear music (but very distantly) in the house.  Each time it was discovered that the music was coming from a bedside radio up on the second floor in the blue guest room.  

In addition, the family’s son (who had his own place) was due to stay in the house in the summer.  The blue room had been designated by the lady in the house to be used for his stay.  My mum organised some flowers for the room, opened up the curtains and windows, and left a selection of towels on the end of the guest room bed ready for his arrival.  The son wasn’t due to arrive until the evening (a few hours after my mum had left) and the following morning my mum was approached by the lady of the house who asked if anything had happened the previous day.  My mum was puzzled and couldn’t think of anything unusual to report.  The lady of the house apologised for the unusual questioning, but said that the whole thing seemed very odd given the usual high quality of my mum’s work.  She then went on to say that on arriving at the house at night, the son had opened up the door to the blue guest room to find the room in stuffy darkness (curtains drawn, windows shut) with the radio set blaring away.  After switching off the radio and turning on the light, he found just a small hand towel on the bed.  It was only by hunting through the room’s cupboards was he able to locate the rest of the towels that should have been provided.  My mum was totally shocked by this and unable to offer an explanation, other than (as she always had) she had left the room with plenty of towels, and with the window and curtains open to air it.  She also didn’t remember using the radio as she had only been in the room for a couple of minutes. 

A little while after this my mum was (again) working alone in the house.  The kitchen required a thorough going over and she was determined to get the floor cleaned and dried before the lady of the house returned.  Switching on the kitchen radio, she set about her task and whilst cleaning up a section of the floor in front of the kitchen door, she was suddenly aware that someone was standing in the doorway.  Moving her cleaning tools aside, she was just about to get up and out of the lady in the house’s way, when she realised, on glancing up, that there was a man standing in the doorway.  Startled by his appearance, my mum began to say something, but as quickly as mum had spotted him in the doorway, he was suddenly no longer there (on questioning later, my mum said that he didn’t dissolve into an ethereal mist, or vanish `poof’ like a magician’s trick, he just suddenly wasn’t there, as if he'd `flicked off'.).  And, although she only got a brief glimpse of him, my mum says she was left with the impression of someone wearing tight black trousers, a billowing white blouse and perhaps with blonde or fair hair -but it was as her eyes travelled up to his face that he’d gone.  

Reaching for one of the kitchen chairs, my mum had a bit of a sit and think, and whilst she was pulling herself together, the house’s doorbell went (making my mum jump out of her skin).  On shakily opening up the front door, my mum was met with the family’s gardener, who after wishing my mum a cautious good morning, told her it looked like she’d seen a ghost!

After that, my mum doesn’t remember anything further happening.  The family remained at the place (without incident) for a further 5 years or so, after which they sold up and moved abroad.

1324287363.0,17,self.Thetruthishere,nicgi,Haunting in Savannah [me],Melawian,17,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/nicgi/haunting_in_savannah_me/,"Every place I live is filled with ghosts. Savannah was no exception. For a year a half I lived in a big old house that had been renovated to be four apartments.  The house had originally been built by a woman whose family had lived on a plantation outside of Savannah.  She had wanted to live closer to town, so her family built her the house. If you are ever in Savannah, the house is right next to Mrs. Wilkes boarding house and can be seen in this picture http://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotos-g60814-d436974-w2-Mrs_Wilkes_Boarding_House-Savannah_Georgia.html#36462540.  It is the red house in the background.


It was a really neat house. Absolutely huge with a fire place in every room.  The part of the house I lived in was a two room studio which had probably been her library or bedroom.   I could see the back of Mrs. Wilkes restuarant and the courtyard that was in the back.  There was a huge tree that had obviously been planted in the back when the house had been built.  The tree had grown up all around the house and the branches were all around my windows giving it the feel of a tree house.

From the first though, the lady of the house let me know her presence.  The second night that I was there, I went to sleep on the couch and instead of going to sleep, I went into a sort of trance like state that could best be described as a sort of other dimension. Everything was black and white.  The lighting was almost as if a strobe light was going off and on.  As a lay there, the lady of the house came up to me and told me that I had better keep her house clean.  She had a full almost hoop skirt and bun.  There was a little black child clinging to her skirt, and I think an older black man that looked like a butler standing in the background.  The room was the same except for the furnishings which were certainly more of the Victorian Era. 

I woke up, not scared, because I see ghosts all the time.  I was a little shaky, though--trips to other dimensions kind of take it out of you.  

Well, I lived there for awhile and little things happened. Things would move.  I'd hear knocking or whispering.  The child often played games with me.  He would hide stuff, move stuff, and change the channels on the tv and the like.  I kept the house clean because she told me to.

A couple of weeks before Christmas, I was decorating the mantel in my room.  I had Jane's Addiction blasting on my sterio. Apparantly, she did not like Jane's Addiction because she made the front of the speakers fall off.  Now, I was a bit shocked, but it didnt really bug me, other than I wanted to listen to Jane's Addiction, and she had no right to tell me otherwise--so i turned it up louder. She turned off the stereo and knocked the front off the speakers off again.  Now I was really mad--I dont let ghosts push me around much--so I took the front of the speakers and nailed them onto the speaker itself--and turned the stereo up. I was satisfied with myself and challenged her to make the front of the speakers fall of again.

Well, when I turned around to put up a manger scene that I was decorating with, she made the ""Mary"" statue fall over as she turned off the stereo and made the front of the speakers come off again--nails and all.  I heard the nails hit the hardwood floor.  Now there were about 5 nails and they all hit the floor--which was exceptionally clean (I did follow that rule)--but when I went to pick up the nails, I couldnt find any of them.  They had vanished.  Completely gone.

I took this as a sign and turned off the stereo and decided to go out for awhile.  When I got home, nothing else happened for the rest of the night, but when I woke up the next day, laying in the middle of the floor was a pendant. I wasnt very big and it said ""Liberty, Maternity, and Fraternity,"" in old timey letters that were stamped on it.  It was weird and kind of had the look of when I went into that other dimension.  I thought it was really cool, though. I wore it for awhile, but I dont know if I lost it or she took it back, but I moved fromt the place and it vanished.

1324001369.0,13,self.Thetruthishere,nem4x,Guardian?,NikkiNewport,15,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/nem4x/guardian/,"I grew up in what was once a court house during the Civil War, and for as long as I can remember I have felt something around me. I'm not sure where to begin, and apologize in advance if this jumps around. There is no demonic entity, no violent or angry spirit, but there is definitely something there. 

Like most of you I try to be as logical as I can in all aspects of life, especially considering the paranormal. I have always had an interest in things of this nature but have never experimented or dabbled in any occult ventures. The risk of attracting something negative has always been too intimidating.

As a child I had imaginary friends, nothing too off about that. I am the oldest of three girls at 22, my sisters being 12 and 7. I have caught both of them, at some point in their toddler years, talking to nothing, just an imaginary friend..I thought. Before either of them were born I would have sleep overs with my friends, and despite not talking to any of them about my suspicions, it was inevitable that one of my guests would have a run in with one of the two ""known"" entities that share my home. 

Most non-family members see a woman in a white dress. I know, I know, this is incredibly cliche, but unless everyone decided at the age of 7 or so to pull a prank on me and keep it running for..well, ever, then I can't brush it off. She's usually in what is now the kitchen, though I have seen her in the upstairs hallway just as many times. Even if you don't see her you'll hear dishes clanking or pots and pans moving, the sound of the stove turning on..The first friend of mine to see her was Dallas (names aren't terribly important, but it's easier to explain this way), it was later at night and we were around 7 as I mentioned earlier. Dallas went to the kitchen to get a drink but didn't make it half way there before she screamed and ran back to the study where we were playing on the computer. She came in stuttering and on the verge of tears asking me who the woman she saw was, and what was going on. I didn't know what to say other than something to the effect of, ""Oh she won't bother us. It's fine."" 

My bedroom was the first room on the right at the top of the stairs. My parent's room was directly across, and I would sleep with my door open not only for the comfort of knowing they were close by, but to allow my pets the freedom to come and go as they pleased. On multiple occasions I awoke in the middle of the night and saw someone standing just outside of my door looking in at me. It was never alarming and I usually went back to sleep fairly quickly. Around the age of 10 or so I insisted on getting those hanging door beads, and saw/heard them moving around and attributed that to what roused me. I can sleep through hurricanes normally. Maybe it was just a reoccurring dream, but I have no history of sleep paralysis/sleep walking.

When my first sister was born I would wake up and see a female shape in my door swaying slightly back and forth, I assumed it was my mother with my sister who must've been hungry/fussing. Every morning I'd ask about Jill being up all night only to get confused looks from both of my parents. I told my mother about what I was experiencing and instead of the expected ""it's just your imagination"" response I was met with ""I know who you're talking about, I've seen her."" The other humanoid shape I would see if not the woman was what appeared to be a man in uniform. My mother confided in me that she had, on more than one occasion, turned around in the attic to see a man behind her..just watching. While this would be incredibly unnerving to almost anyone, his presence was never intimidating. I came to learn that my third-Great Grandfather was a Union solder, and was discharged in my home town. We have a charcoal portrait of him in the study. If you ask either my mother or myself, we think it's him. 

As I got into my teen years of course I would stay up late, sneaking on the phone with friends. I heard the distinctive sounds of footsteps on the stairs/in the hallway (old buildings creak, despite renovations)..afraid I'd get caught/grounded I would hide the phone and ""go to the bathroom"" only to find that every light was off and everyone was fast asleep. I would eventually go to bed, but with my door still shut tight from my secret conversation sessions. One night I was awakened by someone touching my hand. They weren't so much grabbing/holding on but lightly tracing their fingertips down my fingers and palm. Of course, no one was ever there. I began to cocoon myself up tightly in my comforters to avoid these occurrences. Hovering in the hallway is one thing, touching me while I sleep is another. Not soon after I switched rooms so that my younger sisters could share and I could have a considerably smaller, but still private, room at the end of the hall, next to the bathroom. I still heard footsteps, but at least I wasn't seeing/feeling anything any longer. By this time I was a senior in high school and drove my neighbor/best friend to school every morning. One morning my alarm never went off and she called (thankfully) to see what was taking me so long to come outside as she was waiting by my car. 
""What are you doing? Where did you go??"" 
'I was asleep! My bad..shit..I'm coming, I'll be right down, give me five minutes!' 
""Oh..I thought I saw you in the kitchen(we have large bay windows).. you were almost to the door then turned and bolted back to the living room..I thought you forgot something but then you didn't come back.""
""Must've been my mom.. I'll be right down.""

As I headed downstairs I passed my parent's room and saw my mother still in bed sleeping. I hadn't had an experience in a few years at this point and was a little surprised ""She"" was back. My neighbor didn't know anything about this history as she had just moved in a year or so before. I never told her who she saw. 

Six or so months later I met a guy while bar tending for a major restaurant chain. He came in for quite a while before I agreed to see him outside of work, and after a few nights of movies and dinner I felt comfortable enough to go over to his house. We cuddled (very tamely) on the couch while watching a movie and then I went home. A few days later I got a strange call from him asking me what my beliefs were spiritually and if I believed in the paranormal. We had never talked about any of my childhood ""experiences"" as we were still getting to know each other and, frankly, I didn't want to sound like a crazy bitch. I reluctantly went along with the conversation, trying to figure out where he was going with this as it wasn't any time near Halloween. He told me that he was home alone, just tidying up, etc. and got the feeling he was being watched, as he looked across the room he caught a flash-glimpse of a woman in a white dress. I really didn't know what to say, think or feel. He asked if I had any similar occurrences as this had never happened to him and he had a relatively new house. He thought maybe it was something attached to me that decided to stay back and check him out. We didn't see each other much after that, outside of work. 

The only person I can think of that would attach themselves to me and follow me (Whereas I feel Mathias, my great grandfather, is tied to the house) could be my great grandmother. She died when I was two, and was a nurse -- hence the white dress. I wear an engagement ring of hers on my right hand and hardly EVER take it off (only for clinical really..I'm a nursing student atm). When I was born she was living with my grand parents. When I would visit I would stay in what was her room. One time, and only once, I was in the room watching TV and playing and heard my name clearer than anything called out from what seemed like under the bed which I was sitting on. I was only five or six at the time and immediately hopped up, jumped as far as I could off of the bed, and RAN for my grandmother in the living room. There are so many coincidences that I'm almost convinced. 

I moved out of my parents house at the age of nineteen. Since then I haven't had any unexplainable happenings..until this week. The house I live in now, with my significant other, was built 15 years ago. No one has died here or on the land the development was built on, as far as we're aware of at least. I get uneasy feelings from time to time, but always brush it off as irrational paranoia from too much time on Nosleep. You know how it is..a stray, cool breeze will brush your hair/neck, the house will creak or there will be a tapping..it could be anything.. Two nights ago I was lying in bed waiting for my boyfriend to return from a quick store trip (If you're familiar with Wawa, there's three within five miles of the house). I was home alone. Light play on the half opened bedroom door caught my attention and I saw a medium height shadow pass by, heading towards the stairs. Again, I ignored it..""I'm just tired."" Maybe 3 minutes later I saw the same shadow and pattern. The sun was down, no street lights shine in to any of the windows on that side of the house..

Today when I got home from school I attempted to recreate it with my boyfriend..I finally broke down and told him about it..if I'm crazy then fuck it, it's nothing new. The only way to get a similar shadow to appear on the door is to be RIGHT outside of it..and as I said it was half open. I would have seen anyone/thing passing by..or heard it at the very least..there was NOTHING. I'm hoping it's my great grand mother checking in on me. and I'm hoping whoever it is keeps to the hallway this time around.

1320848110.0,14,self.Thetruthishere,m634c,[Me] At my sister's funeral,littlegoth,25,11,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/m634c/me_at_my_sisters_funeral/,"When I was a teenager, there were a rash of deaths.  Each a year apart, each someone I knew, and each involving a car.  That alone was pretty creepy, but the most memorable thing happened at my ""sister's"" funeral.

I should preface this with the fact that she wasn't my blood relation, instead a sister of the heart, and of circumstances.  My family met up with hers a good bit and we were thrown together.  I was the annoying ""little sister"" being that I was a good 5 (or more) years younger.  Despite that fact, when another sister (of similar circumstances) appeared at our house early one morning our family reacted the way any family would.  We packed everything and got on the road within hours.

Upon arriving at my uncle's house, we were shuffled into bedrooms.  Nicole (the living sister) and I were put in Nancy's room (who just died) because it was easiest for us to get up the rickety pull-down attic staircase.  I lugged things up and proceeded to make myself at home on the floor, I wasn't going to sleep in Nancy's bed.  All the mirrors were covered, and despite my mood the room was bright and cheerful.  Nicole climbed up, gathered Nancy's jingle dress and told me to stay out of the way, it was only the first of the four day funeral and I wasn't going to help with the washing of the body because I was too young.
Then my uncle came and called me down.  He handed me a phone and told me to sit in Nancy's room, and if anyone called to explain where they all were.  It was a very important job, and he was relying upon me to manage it.
It was one of those [streamlined home phones](http://www.thephoneresource.com/images/210_lg.jpg), and it had an uber long cord, but it was only long enough to sit just outside the small doorway at the top of the stairs.  The doorway opened out into the stairwell area, and at most was only about 3 feet tall and somewhere between 2 and 2.5 feet wide, it was like one of those cute doors that you usually see under staircases.

I took the phone with a nod and climbed back up the staircase, setting the phone down as close to the little door as I could get it, and went to turn on the stereo so I could read and listen to music as I waited for extra news, or to impart the bit I had been given.  

Once I was about 3 feet from the door with my back to it, I heard the creak of the hinges, then the slam of the door coming to a close.  That alone was unnerving, but the kicker was that I heard the phone falling down the steps to the floor.  That unique sound of an encased bell being knocked around and plastic impacting on hard surfaces.

I sighed and scooted back to the door, kicking it open in frustration.  The sight that met my eyes was mind boggling.  The phone was just sitting where I had left it.  I leaned forward and placed my fingers on the cold plastic and then with a shake of my head, I moved back into the room.

Once again when I made it a few feet away from the door, with my back to it, the small door slammed shut, and the phone banged down to the concrete garage floor below.  My head whipped to the sound and I moved back, this time pausing before the doorway to listen if someone was pulling this prank on me.  Listening for any sound in the house, or on the stairs.  There was nothing, and when I pushed the door open, the same sight met me.  Everything was as I left it.

I was more confused than scared, but I shrugged it all off, this time opting to move the phone a bit father away from the door so that the cord wasn't pulled as tightly and then I checked that it was secure.  I pulled at the cord and the phone stayed put, I also pushed at the phone, trying to nudge it out of place.  Finally, I bounced on the sliver of floor between the steps and the doorway.  The phone was secure.  Not taking any chances with the door, I found the small bit of twine that Nancy used to hold the door open and attached it to the inside doorknob.  I pulled and pushed at the door before being confident that the strange behavior would stop.  I called out into the house below that I was upstairs and if they needed me to come get me and turn turned around and crawled back into the room.  This time however, my destination had changed.  I moved in and turned once in the doorway, going to look at something on a shelf on the opposite side I had originally intended on going.

I pulled myself to my feet and after a few steps, the familiar sound of the small door slamming closed and the phone tumbling down the steps met my ears.  I spun quickly and I saw the door opening slowly from its closed position the rope nowhere to be seen.  The phone was clearly visible from the angle I was standing in, and it seemed to shift and nestle before my eyes.  The door pulled completely open and when I walked over to check, the small rope was once again attached to the inside knob like I had left it.

At this point I was a little scared, but also just a little too numb from the rest of the things that were happening to be truly terrified, so I slid out the doorway onto the rickety and squeaky steps, grabbing the phone as I went and walked the entire house, calling for anyone who was there to come out.  After searching and being convinced I was alone, I climbed the steps and replaced the phone, giving the door a quick and careful tug as I passed it and moved toward the stereo again.  

As I moved, I noticed that one of the mirrors wasn't completely covered.  The bottom corner near the doorway was peeking out.  The fitted sheet that was used and slid off the bottom corner of the mirror.  I looked at the corner of glass for a moment and I saw what seemed to be a shadow flit over the surface and immediately after that the door slammed shut and the phone's falling echoed through the small room.  I pulled my eyes away from the mirror and looked at the doorway and it was slowly resetting itself before snapping shut in front of my eyes.  I looked back at the mirror corner and then moved quickly to cover it.  I checked every other mirror in Nancy's room before opening the door to discover the same exact thing I had discovered numerous times before.  Everything was the way I left it.

The door didn't slam closed nor did the phone fall after that, but for the next 3 days, I was sure to double check any mirror that I saw, to make sure each cover was secure.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_m634c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/m634c/me_at_my_sisters_funeral/,

I was laying for about 5 minutes when clear as day in my ear I heard ""Don't go to sleep Patrick."" This horrified me beyond belief that it knew my name. Another evening I was laying in my bed and all of the sudden there was scratching on my comforter on my feet and I do not have any animals. I have also felt pressure as if something was holding me down. I have also seen multiple shadows. I know a bit about where my house is.

I've updated it with a few things that I've remembered since posting it the first time. I hope the style is acceptable.

My nightmares never involve being chased by things. On the contrary, in my dreams, I'm shut inside my house and something is trying to get in. 

As a child, I used to have disturbing dreams about a fox character, [Basil Brush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Basilbrushv2.jpg). I don't remember how those dreams ended, only that he would stalk around the walls of the house, trying to find a way in, staring through any windows without the curtains pulled. I spent my pre-teen years in an urban area without much in the way of wildlife. We moved to get closer to the high school I would be attending, into an area next to the forest. 

Those of us who have heard it in the night, know that [the bark of a fox](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ard_6SbDmJ0) is a ridiculously creepy thing to hear coming out of the darkness. It was definitely something of a shock, when I first heard the sounds; as a young teenager, staying up far too late into the early hours of the morning, in the study with the window that backs onto our large, wooded garden.

So imagine a teenage me, lying awake in bed, listening to the foxes howl outside. My bedroom window looks out from above the front door, and with the acoustics of the street I can follow their movements. It's late summer and I'm restless, it's too hot and their squeals are echoing incessantly. 

I hear the squawking of one particular fox, getting closer to the house. It starts off quiet, and I imagine its paws padding along the road. In my mind, I can see it turn the corner into our cul-de-sac. I hear it approach the house, down our driveway. This isn't too unusual; they like our garden and they can access plenty of other places from under the fence. But this fox doesn't follow the path I expect. The barking gets louder and louder, coming almost directly below me, until... bam!

I hear the sound of the front door rattling in its hinges from a heavy blow. I bolt upright, although I know the door held fast. 

The bizarre yelping then recedes into the night and I lay back down, sweating and shivering at the same time.

I shrugged the incident off at first. But then, several more times that year, I would hear the sound of a barking fox approaching and then a slam against an outer door, sometimes the back, sometimes the front. Nothing ever came of it, and it never happened again after that winter. 

And so, here I am, years afterwards, and I still wonder what on earth was happening. Why would a fox try to enter a house? I wouldn't have thought one would be capable of the thought processes necessary. My house at university was broken into a while back, through an undamaged back door (swinging uselessly open, with the lock still set in the closed position, I had to 'unlock' it to close it again) by an unseen antagonist who fled as soon as I stumbled out of my room. This incident got me thinking about the past, and I remembered those events which may otherwise have entirely disappeared from my memory. 

I don't have a particularly exciting life, so this might all sound trivial to some of the members of this subreddit, but I feel like these mundane stories should be passed on, even if only to get them out of my head.

[Long-ish],IllusoryCorrelation,17,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/jk62v/what_was_in_that_fog_longish/,"Starting in 2004, I left my relatively comfortable American home and traveled to South America for a little over a year.  Mainly I spent my time in Peru, but I also spent a bit of time in Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.

While I was in the Andes mountains of Peru in a city called Juliaca, I had some of the strangest and scariest experiences of my life.  Of these, this one stands out as the most disturbing.

It was late at night.  Ordinarily, I tried not to be out on the street in the more desolate areas of town much after eight or nine.  To be out later than that was to be inviting a mugging, even if you are a big guy (6'4"", 240) like me.  This night, though, I found myself out visiting a friend I had made who had fallen ill and was bed-ridden.  It was almost eleven by the time I realized the hour, and so I bid a hasty farewell and started on the long trek across the city back to the house at which I was staying.  

During the daylight hours, it would have been simple for me to find a tri-cycle taxi called a ""trici"" (tree-see) which would have gotten me home in about twenty minutes.  At this time of night, though there was no hope of encountering any sort of taxi to take me home.  I was going to have to walk, which would likely make it a forty-five minute trip.  Figuring I wanted to get home as quickly as possible, I struck out at a fairly quick pace.

As I walked along the deserted dirt roads, it struck me just how cold it was.  Being 14,000 feet above sea level, it would often get chilly at night even during the summer, but here we were in October and it was downright cold, and it seemed to be getting colder. I shivered against the cold and picked up my pace even more.  

I got to a cross street that would lead me almost straight back to my house and turned the corner where I suddenly encountered a wall of fog.  It was incredibly surreal.  One minute on one street there was no fog, but upon turning a corner I was met with a seemingly impenetrable wall.  I paused for a moment and considered going around a different way, but not wanting to be out on the street any later than absolutely necessary, I took a deep breath and walked into the shroud of fog.

Inside the fog it was obviously colder.  I began shivering almost uncontrollably as I penetrated deeper and deeper.  After about five minutes, I had the impression that someone was behind me.  I paused and listened, but heard nothing.  The soft glow of the weak streetlights overhead barely provided any relief from the fog and I could see nothing unless it was within about five feet of me.

I waited a moment, and proceeded onward.  Again, I heard it.  Not the steady crunching sound of footsteps, but something else.  It sounded as if something were being dragged.  It was a light constant crunch against the stone and dirt that made up the road. I walked faster hoping that I could simply outpace whatever it was behind.  Still, I could hear it coming on.  It got no farther away and it got no closer.  Still, I couldn't see anything for the fog.

After a few minutes that felt like an eternity, I broke into a run for the nearest cross street.  Still the dragging, crunching sound stayed right behind me.  I raced toward the next street and took a hard left, sprinting faster than I ever had before or have since.  Still the fog was with me, and still the crunching continued.  I raced down the street. I looked behind me and the thick fog continued to stretch down the street, the crunching still back there.  As I sprinted past the next street, the fog suddenly ended.  The world seemed flood with light as the streetlights above me glowed down onto me.

I skidded around a corner and stopped.  I was breathing hard, but managed to control my breathing and listen for the crunching sound.  I was maybe fifty feet from where I had left the fog, and around a corner on a deathly silent street, but there was no sound except the rasping of breathing in the thin mountain air. I glanced around the corner to see if anything was there and was shocked by what I found.  There was absolutely no fog anywhere to be found.

What was that strange fog? And what was it that was seemingly pursued me? I asked around among some of the locals, but there were never any answers, no explanations that made any sort of sense as to what I had experienced.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_jk62v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/jk62v/what_was_in_that_fog_longish/,

Don't really know in English, but she's my father's mother's sister-in-law. My family was among those who were closer to her. My grandmother got along really well with her, and her being a badass matriarchal figure, that meant my great-aunt got a lot of cred in the family passed down with my grandma.

We're Indian and my grandparents live with us, and it was after a particularly eventful week this story takes place. A cousin of ours got married with Thursday and Friday being devoted to religious functions and some partying in the evening. Then on Saturday, the wedding was held in the morning and a pretty huge (by our standards) reception that lasted throughout the night. My grandparents went to wish the couple a good future, and our whole family had a pretty great time. My great-aunt was among those laughing and dancing with the kids and enjoying herself.

Then, Monday night, we got a phone call that said she was sick and put in the hospital. Tuesday morning we found out it was pneumonia, and then Tuesday night she passed away with filled lungs. The funeral was set to go on Thursday morning. I was in high school at the time and my parents were on later schedules, so I told my family I'd wake them up when I left for school.

Thursday morning, I'm out of the shower, looking in the mirror to fix my hair and tie (my friend-circle followed what we called ""Dress for Success Thursdays"" despite dressing HORRENDOUSLY normally). It was pretty temperate but I felt a sudden chill. My hair started to stand on end, though there was no sudden pang of fear or panic.

I saw my great-aunt walk up towards the bathroom door, off a few feet to my left. I saw her in the mirror turn and look at me. And I turned to the door to see her walk farther up the hall. She looked like she had come from my brother's room and had passed my grandparents' room on the way. I saw her out of the corner of my eye while I saw her reflection, then I saw her reflection and her DEAD ON, SIMULTANEOUSLY. Then, I walked out of the bathroom and saw a faint cloud dissipate in the beams of sunlight shining through the windows of the living room. Obviously reminded of her funeral, I went to remind my parents, and asked them if they had heard or seen anything. They had no idea.

She looked to be checking up on us, making sure we were all okay. I consider myself pretty spiritual by Hindu standards, though not in the orthodox way. I was not grief-stricken at all by her death because she had celebrated life, and though it was sudden, I knew that she lived well and was thankful that she didn't really suffer. I was amazed that out of anyone in my family, I was the only one who had seen her. At number family engagements since, I've asked around and no one had any similar experience.

It's sort of interesting, too. I'm not proselyting, but some context/background helps here... My family's all Hindu. We believe in reincarnation and karma and all of that. It's not that ghosts don't happen, but they're kind of a special case, at least if they linger for very long. Since no one has had any experience of her since the funeral, I think it's safe to assume she moved on, but it was cool to catch that glimpse of her between dying and departing.

I'll never forget the look in her eye though: a definite look of detached concern. I don't think I've ever seen anyone else with that particular expression before or after. You could tell she was... gone.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_j0avg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/j0avg/walking_down_the_hall_xpost_from_nosleep/,

(x-post from nosleep)",jivanyatra,16,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/j0afw/do_you_have_a_cigarette_xpost_from_nosleep/,"Some time ago, I went with my family to India to spend a few months with my family. Life's more laid back for people who earn in America, since the equivalency of things like food, clothes, and cleaning is in our favor. Electronics and internet access are comparable or more expensive in certain cases, and so we decided to stay relatively tech-free.

We ended up going to spend some time in my mother's family's village, where her mom had grown up. Riding on some of the roads in the middle of Gujarat was definitely an interesting sight. It's almost like the American countryside, but without paved roads, rest areas, and towns with nice restaurants. It was definitely fun, though, seeing some wilder forests and old bridges on our way out there. I had a good time with my cousins and my mom's cousins, so I decided to stay a little longer after my parents and brother went back into the city.

Nights went by and we shared stories. We talked about how life was different across the world and the topic eventually came around to the supernatural. Rural India has a lot of interesting different kinds of ghosts and ghouls. Vetaals are sort of between zombies and vampires, for example.

My mom's cousin started to talk about how when he was young, he'd go off with his friends and play in the woods, and one day they met a jhand. These particular ghosts were spirits of travelers lost on the road, who usually asked for some assistance. You wouldn't really know anything was wrong until you looked down and saw their feet were on backwards. Him and his friends found a stray boy in the forest with a lost look in his eyes, asking for the road to the fort. They sort of got creeped out, because the only thing he could have been talking about was the city of Ahmedabad. It was a fort a few hundred years ago (there are still gates all around the city that are now monuments to its history), but it's been a city instead for a while.

They noticed his clothes were a little funny, his dhoti was torn, and then they saw he had his feet on backwards. They freaked and booked it home, staying away from the woods for a long time after that. We all kind of laughed at the ridiculousness of the story, but gave the woods on the edge of town a wary look. On the whole, though, it was a great time.

A week flew by, and I had plans to meet up with my brother and cousins for shopping early the next morning. My cousin in the village, Gopal, said he'd be happy to take me into the city that night. He started up his motorcycle (two-wheelers are abundant in India because they're cheap transportation). I got on back and we made our way slowly and carefully along the road back to Ahmedabad. We saw some people walking around in the villages we passed and a few cars on the road, but not much more.

We passed a section of road that went through the forest. I hadn't remembered that from the drive out, but Gopal probably took a different route knowing what was safer and what wasn't. We eased up a bit around a sharp bend, and suddenly, his engine died. We stopped in the middle of a dark road right in front of a small bridge over a stream.

Confused, he asked me to get down and help him take a look to see if there was anything wrong. No leaks, no stray problems. He goes to give it a kick-start, but the engine won't turn over.

""Do you have a cigarette?""

We both jumped nearly out of our skin. There was a guy leaning up against one of the vaad trees nearby (peepal, or Sacred Fig tree). He looked a little creepy and was standing in the shade just off of the road so we couldn't see him very well.

""Sorry?"" I managed to ask.

""Give me a cigarette. I'm lost and had a bad day. I just need a smoke.""

Gopal motioned for me to back up towards the bike. ""Sorry, man, we don't smoke."" He kicked again, and the engine came to life. I hopped on, feeling very weirded out and glad to leave.

We were crossing the bridge and I let out a sigh, and just then, a feeling of dread passed over me. The wind was starting to pick up speed, as were we, but then out of nowhere-

""WHY DIDN'T YOU GIVE ME A CIGARETTE!"" A harsh voice, rasping out a shout that was stifled enough to be a whisper. Loud and soft at the same time, it came from right behind my left ear. I jumped a bit, and snapped my head to the left to see a gruesome face filled with rage and demanding sympathy.

You know, I almost felt for him, too. Then I noticed that his head was floating next to me, and his neck and torso stretched over the bridge back to where that guy was standing. His fucking legs were still under the tree. I swear, if I could see his feet, they'd have been fucking backwards.

I couldn't move or talk out of fear. I must have thrown off Gopal's balance a bit when I was snapped my head around because I noticed we slowed down a bit.

Frantically, I started to smack his side with my right hand. Lucky for me, he looked over his left shoulder instead of his right. If he hadn't... Anyway, he looks over his left, his eyes widen with fear, and whoosh.

He give it a hell of a lot of gas and we got the fuck out of there. We ended up making it home safely, though all kinds of shaken up. Gopal stayed overnight and left during the day, and since the village doesn't really have internet access or reliable phone service, so I didn't really know if he'd gotten home okay.

A week later, Gopal and his dad came to visit us before we left the city, and I was obviously glad that he was okay. I had told my mom the story, but no one else. It wasn't until she saw the fear on Gopal's face when I mentioned it that she believed me. They decided to pick up a carton of cigarettes on their way back to the village.

I never experienced anything unusual until a couple months ago.

In April of this year my mom, my three siblings, and I went to visit my grandparents who live in Texas. I live on the east coast so it was pretty hot up there compared to where I'm from. Anyways, my grandfather owns and apartment complex where he also lives. The apartments are set up in a big rectangle with a huge field in the middle where anyone could hang out or kids could play. In between each apartment there's a little space with a sidewalk.

So one day during my visit I decided to go outside and have a cigarette. The rest of the family was inside with the AC on because it was 90 degrees that day. I brought out a magazine with me and leaned against the side of the apartment, reading and smoking my cigarette.

I finally finished and put it out and turned in the direction to walk back towards the door to the apartment. Where I was standing I could see the whole field. What I saw next terrified me still till this day. In the middle of the field were two figures dressed all in black, long sleeves head-to-toe black...in 90 degree weather!!

I couldn't see their faces because their heads were down like they were looking at their feet. These things were really tall and they both took very slow synchronized steps. That really scared me. What normal person walks that slow, matching their steps to the person next to them?

I was frozen to the spot. The weird thing was that all noise stopped for that 30 seconds. I could not hear a thing, I was only seeing them. But they never looked at me, they just walked with their heads down. Finally I reacted and started to run. I literally looked down for a second and when i looked back up while running, they were gone! And I could hear everything again.

Terrified, I went inside and told my mom. She genuinely looked scared. She asked ""Are you sure they didn't just walk away, they vanished?""

There was no way they could vanish in a matter of seconds, even if they ran, because the field was so bid. My mom couldn't explain what it was but she told me not to be outside by myself anymore.

I told one of my friends what happened to me and she said it could be the grim reaper and his wife and that it was your time to die but they let you live.

Hi guys! I'm really glad I found this subreddit as I've had a few experiences and having no friends/family who experience these sorts of uh... experiences (WOW I NEED A THESAURUS), I guess this is my personal rant, as well as an attempt to find someone who's similar.

Here's some background:
Since as long as I can remember I can feel things, but never see. For example, I can sense that a place is a bad place, but I can't see any ghostly figures or mists. I am extremely sensitive to emotions and left over auras of things and places; and this causes me some serious discomfort (eg. Went to a refurbished prison, and was crying the whole night after because of sick, dark emotions not my own. I fell into really bad depression after speaking to a friend about her depression/situation even though I should have no reason to be so extremely depressed.) Ugh. When I drive pass the local psychiatric hospital I NOPE like no tomorrow... Anyways, my main reason for this post is as follows.

My most amazing/unbelievable experience happened in Japan. Now, I love that place, people not withstanding. I loved the shrines and what not, and during my second visit with friends, we visited the Inari Shrine (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushimi_Inari-taisha) near Kyoto (seriously beautiful and mystical place). Jokingly, I opened up to soak up the delicious aura (I know it's weird but... that's what it feels like to me) and say hello to what ever entity that was on the mountain. There was a small conversation, but hey, no one takes conversations in their own heads seriously. So when we were lost coming down the mountain, I jokingly asked how to get down to the main part. I actually got a response, in terms of feelings and vague voices in my head telling me to follow, but REALLY, THERE WAS SIMPLY NO WAY I WOULD TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. I thought I was going crazy and imagining things. A legitimate response in that sort of mystical/religious setting. 

Next day, as I was waiting for my friends in Shinjuku, I was bored so I jokingly asked the Inari fox spirits to show me something interesting. Note: I have never been to this place, I did not have a map on me, nor have I studied any guides about Shinjuku because I was lazy. LOL. So, following my feelings and voices in my head, I ended up walking the small streets until lo and behold, I ran into a small Inari shrine hidden in some residential street. Literally, I had goosebumps all over... Of all the places I randomly come across after walking randomly I come across a shrine dedicated to the very spirits I prayed to? EXCUSE ME, EVEN SKEPTICAL ME IS GETTING A LITTLE EDGY.

I proceeded to thank and ask them to show me around Shinjuku. Weirdly, I find myself being led to monuments that are all red, with my spirit guides explaining to me that they liked playing around red things. To this day, I have no logical explanations for what happened and the  coincidence theory is getting a little stretched.

Other stuff has happened on this trip and after I came back to Australia, but this post is getting too long lol Ask away if you are curious! 

Basically, I am tired of not being able to talk to people about this with out them looking at me like I need to be institutionalised. But then again, some times /I/ think I'm crazy.

I can only think of a few other places that have scared me in my life, the other ones being for concrete reasons--i.e. located in a bad area of town.

My problem with my room started when we moved in. I'd wake up on the floor, under my desk. I would never remember getting out of bed in the middle of the night, waking up one or two times on the floor, being scared shitless, then falling back asleep. I did this for a long, long time. I remember telling my mom at some point it was because of the ""Abraham Lincoln ghost,"" but I don't remember what that refers to, if anything at all.

I've been scared a handful of occassions in my room, but nothing stands out as much as what happened in January. 

Something awful happened. Something rustled me out of my sleep. I was being choked. It was NOT sleep paralysis, I could move my arms, I could move my legs, but I was being choked. It was a dark mass. I had never been so scared in my life. After a short while, it all subsided.

I have wanted to post this in a long time. It´s about two things I´ve experienced but can´t explain. I´m posting the first thing now and the second thing later. Believe me or not but I know what I saw and I would like someone to help me explain this! 

The first thing happened when I was in the 5th grade or something (now I’m 22 and studying at the University). I came home from school in the evening and my mother was in the kitchen cooking some dinner. When you entered the house from the front door we had a corridor strait forward that was leading to the living room. To the right there was the kitchen and to the left the stairs that’s leading up to the 2nd floor. Well.. My mom was in the kitchen cooking some dinner and I wanted to help her. I entered the kitchen and while I was doing that I looked to my right. In our kitchen at the time we had a sideboard and on the side of that a box full of paper. When I looked at it I saw a metallic looking orb. I´ve never seen it before. It looked like a cannonball or something but brighter than a cannonball but it wasn’t shining or looked shiny. It didn´t levitate or anything. It was just a dull looking orb. Anyhow.. when I looked at it the orb started rolling towards me and down in the box with papers. When it landed the papers rustled. I started to look for the orb in the paper box but I didn’t find it. My mom looked as well when I told her what happened. She thought it was strange and didn’t believe it was something. Like I was seeing stuff. We didn’t paid so much attention to it while we were eating. We had dinner for about 20 minutes or something and after we were done I went up the stairs to go to my room. When I stood in the doorway facing my room I saw the same orb laying on my bed! I looked at it and it did like the first time I saw it! It rolled down from my bed and I heard a *bonk* (like something heavy dropped on the floor) and started rolling towards me (I heard like *wobble, wobble, wobble* as it was rolling). It rolled past my feet, out in the hallway on the 2nd floor and down the stairs. I didn’t get scared and I did not follow it. Don’t ask me why I didn´t  followed it because I don’t know why. I just entered my room looking at the bed.  I saw something heavy had been there because the sheets had markings. I know what I saw but I don’t know what to make of it. Like I said. I didn’t get scared but if I saw it today I probably would!

A few months before we started dating last Summer, my boyfriend got sleep paralysis where he saw a woman in white at the end of his bed, she reached out to him and he freaked out so she started laughing.  The next time, we had been dating for a bit and he was hanging out with his friend who was sleeping on the couch across from his bed.  My boyfriend got sleep paralysis again and saw the same woman, but she was covered in blood.  A time after that while I was sleeping over one time, I got sleep paralysis (Which I NEVER do, had it once when I was little and that was it) but had sense not to look around the room and just fell back to sleep.

Fast forward to last Monday, we had been in town to a ""New Age"" store and he wanted to see if they had anything to help with the Sleep Paralysis and we ended up talking to the lady for a while about it.  She recommended amethyst or smudging if it was a ""spirit"", or it could be something in the house.  We're moving in June, so he said we should wait to see if it goes away when we move. Late that night I was sleeping over, his mom woke us up early to give him something and he was back to sleep immediately and I was on the verge when I suddenly hear him hyperventilating so I shake him awake and he lays there shaking for a bit then tells me he saw her eyes right in front of his face.  He falls back to sleep again, and then the same hyperventilating happens and I wake him up again and this time he says he heard thunder that time.  He was facing the other direction so he probably couldn't see anything.

Anyone have any advice to make him stop seeing this thing?  I'm fairly certain it's just in his head and doing something that he believes will help will make it stop.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1edr73,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1edr73/disme_adventures_in_sleep_paralysis/,
1367272568.0,13,self.Thetruthishere,1dd80v,[ME] The old woman in my dream. Would really appreciate some outside perspective.,PATROLLINGTHE_MOJAVE,23,10,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1dd80v/me_the_old_woman_in_my_dream_would_really/,"This happened to me about 3 months ago, and it still gives me chills. I can't help this feeling of dread whenever I think of this woman, and I constantly wonder what her coming means / meant for me. 

A little backstory, my family is very spiritual. Not in the traditional, religious sense, but in a very New Age way. My grandmother was a vegetarian all her life, a strong psychic, and avid user of healing crystals and herbs. My mother, aunt, uncle (aunt's husband), and cousin are all spiritual in their own ways, although my uncle, cousin and I are much more serious about the practice than my aunt or mother. From what I can tell and have heard, my mother was a very strong empath her entire life, but something (she will not tell me nor has she told anyone in the family) happened when she was in her 20s which made her cut all her ties and mental connections to the spirit world. As her daughter, being in my 20s now is making me a little nervous that the same thing may happen to me. 


Now, here's my story. I was asleep, my dreams prior to this one completely lost on me. All I can remember is suddenly everything became hyper-realistic, as if it were truly happening. I was out with my family, in a park, and I couldn't shake this feeling of someone watching me. Finally, after turning in circles, I found the person watching me. It was an old woman, about 100 yards from me. I shrugged it off as best I could, getting back to whatever we were doing. Fast forwarding, we left the park and went downtown to some stores. Again, the feeling of being watched. I looked around and there she was again, the old woman. Only now she was closer. About 50 yards closer. As we progressed through our shopping, I noticed that each time I got the feeling, she would be a little bit closer. And as she got closer, I noticed she had this horrifying grin on her face. It was an ear-to-ear grin, causing all these wrinkles to form deeply in her face, her eyes unblinking and crinkled. I was truly freaked out. I asked my family if we could just go home, and they obliged. After getting home, I felt much more relaxed. This was my safe spot, my escape. After telling my family about the old woman and laughing off the nerves, I decided to take a shower in my bathroom upstairs. My mom said she needed to run to the store, but that she would be back in a little bit. Then she left. I sat on my bathroom floor, waiting for the water to heat up, enjoying my time and still laughing a little about what had happened. Then I heard something. I froze. My mother had just left, I know that. I peeked over the top of the stairs, but didn't see anything. I shook it off, simply attributing my reaction to a bad house foundation and a case of nerves. I checked the water in my shower, turned around, and there she was. Peeking at me from the stairs. She wasn't all the way up them yet, only about halfway, so all I could see was the top of her head to her eyes. But she was still smiling at me, her eyes still wrinkled from the permanent grin plastered on her face. I slammed my bathroom door (which does not lock) and ran into the actually room with the bathtub and shower and shut that door (which does lock). I turned off the water and sat down in the tub, shaking. The silence was killing me, I couldn't hear any movement. I closed my eyes and tried counting to ten, but as I got somewhere around 7 or 8, I began hearing this faint sound coming from the other side of my locked door. It took me a few seconds to register she was scratching at the door. That old, grinning creature was standing at my door, slowly scratching at the only thing protecting me from her. I started to scream, and then I woke up. 


I have no idea what this dream means. It still terrifies me today, and simply typing it out made my heart race. I have no idea what could have caused such a frightening creature to enter my dreams, what it was, or what it meant. But there's one of my unexplainable experiences, and one of the few ones to truly shake me up. If anyone has any kind of analysis or perspective as to what this could have been, I am all ears!

My parents were asleep and I was on the computer. The computer room was next to my parents room.

At the time, my brother was 4 and was in the living room, lounging on his little sofa and watching tv.

While I was browsing the web on the computer, I had this sudden feeling I was being watched. Looking at the doorway, I saw what I assumed was little brother, staring at me, his mouth opened slightly, almost in awe.

As we made eye contact, he did this funny turn (he was doing a lot of little stepping as he turned) and he ran into my parents bedroom.

I jumped out of the chair, saying ""No! Our Parents are asleep!”

As I turned to my parents room, the door was still closed, I hadn't heard it open or close either.

I looked over to the living room and little brother was still on the couch watching TV.

I thought back on what I saw and remembered how he looked.

He was pale, wearing a white shirt with little chequered lines on it which were a light grey colour.
His cargo shorts were also white.

He had hair, but it appeared shaven, it was white peach fuzz like hair growing back.

His eyes were completely black, no pupil, no colour, no whites, just black.

I never saw him again after that. 
Maybe you guys could help me out.

As I can't wait to post a part two, here is my cousin K's side of the story!

If you have not read part one yet, please read here:

[My cousins' and aunt W's side of the story!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/13eybr/mefam_undead_uncle_my_cousins_side_of_the_story/)

K is pretty badass. There is almost nothing he is afraid of. He is an international successful motorbike racer and did trips through Malaysia, Thailand, Kambodia, Laos and other asian countries with his motorbike gang. Sometimes he is on very long trips with his mates through asian countries. There is only one thing he is afraid of: paranormal activities. He has a lot of stories to tell and I will post them if you like, but as this is a story about my uncle, I will only explain his experiences with my uncle.

Sometimes, when my family comes together, we start to talk about old family stories. Usually we end up talking about my uncle. My cousin refuses to say my uncle's name, as everytime he says his name, something very strange will happen. But sometimes my cousin would forget about what happens to him and he just talks about my uncle and mentions his name. Sometimes we make fun of him having said the name.

Once, when I visited my family, we were eating and started talking. We ended up talking about my uncle and K accidentally said his name. We laughed and joked about it.

When my cousin sat on his motorbike and drove off, we noticed that it sounded very weird, as he drove around the corner (there is a window facing the street, but there is a wall between the window and the street, so you can't see what's going on on the street). Kind of as if he accidentally drove over something, then hitting the brakes very hard and then hitting the gas pedal, driving very fast.

We were a bit confused, as my cousin is a very secure driver, he never had an accident in his whole career and drove very carefully within neighbourhoods.

My aunt W decided to call him, as she knew there must have been something weird going on. She asked him why he drove home in such a weird manner and if everything was ok. He told her that there was a huge snake on the street, as thick as his thigh and that he saw it in the last moment and tried to break, but he could not prevent driving over the snake. He was so scared, that he wanted to get home as fast as possible, so he hit the gas pedal. In the mirror he still saw the snake, but was surprised that the construction workers walked around as if there was nothing strange at all. Thais believe that when you walk over a snake, you have to go home as fast as you can, otherwise something bad will happen. At least my uncle believed that.

We were all so scared that the snake may come into the house or something, that we decided to go out and check if the snake is still there. The ground was wet, so the snake should have left a cast. After about 20 minutes of looking around, we decided to ask the construction workers if they have seen the snake. They said no, but there would be a special tree (superstitious Thais believe that these kind of trees are some sort of portals for goddesses, fairies etc. to make an excursion into our world) and they only saw a couple strolling along the street, coming from the direction of the tree, when my cousin K drove by and abruptly stopped his bike. K swears that he did not see anyone walking along the street.

This story is so weird, because there were no branches on the street, which could have resembled a snake in any kind of way.

What do you think it was? What do you think about the strange things which happen to my cousin when he says my uncle's name?

I can't handle it.,nyancat89,18,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/10a0ka/me_first_time_posting_on_here_im_officially/,"I've lived in my house since I was born. I've never been anywhere else. Now when I think about it, strange things have always kind of happened here. When I was a baby my mother would tell me that I would stand up in my crib and yell at the closet. I was afriad of it and I still am for some reason. I never got to meet my Grandfather but I heard that before I was born my parents had his ashes in my closet for a short time while they were preparing me and my sisters room. While the ashes were in there my parents said that the closet doors would slam so hard that they would fall off the rails. Soon after they scattered his ashes in the lake he wanted and I guess things stopped. But from about 6 years old to now (22) I've seen some weird things around here. But it happened so rarely i t never bothered me. What I would always see is a black shadow going from my parents room down the hallway to the bathroom. it used to freak me out but I got used to it.

Just recently though I've been seeing it more than ever. And apparently my family has seen it too. Though my sister says she sees a green or blue-ish light. And about a week ago I was almost falling asleep in my bed and I slowly felt myself being shaken. I thought it was an earthquake so I got out of bed and looked on the news..no earthquake... I guess its been bothering everyone here so my mother contacted a friend of a friend who claims to be sensitive to ghosts. I always thought these people were crazy but when she came and walked into the hallway I was able to see goosebumps appear on her arm as she said ""oh wow you definitly have someone here"" that's when I freaked out. She says that she feels its a female and that its not here to hurt anyone. I asked why has it been coming around so much and she said that its attracted to the new baby in our house (my sister had a baby a few months ago). She claims its protecting the child but really it doesn't matter to me. I don't like seeing this kinda shit. I really can't handle seeing it again. Ever since I've heard this news I've been having a hard time sleeping at night.

My family has a few strange stories so I thought I'd post them up for you. These are true, certainly mine were (Pt. 1) and my family don't tend to exaggerate heavily or lie so I believe their stories as well. This is my side of the family, I'll post my partners and his families up in Pt. 3.

Anyway, enjoy (:

*For this part I'll divide the stories by house and then add any extras on the end.*

**The bungalow**

My mother was with another man before my father who she had my two siblings to, Angela and Shane. This didn't work out so when she left him she moved back in with her mother in a bungalow they had out the back.

**Touched**

One night my family was throwing a gathering and it was kicking on late so mum sent Angela to bed, I'm not sure where my brother was but he was a little turkey so chances are he was dodging the adults all night. Angela went to bed and was falling asleep when she felt someone touching her hair. Her bed was flush against a wall and when she woke up she was facing it. Thinking nan had come to pat her while she fell asleep she opened her eyes, but instead of nan she saw these black spindly hands reaching out of the wall and trying to grab her. 

Now I just want to say this stories pretty crazy I agree, but my sister tells it with such conviction and truth in her eyes that I believe her. I just want to take this moment to emphasise that my sister is the kind of person who will explore every logical scenario she can think of before she *unwillingly* settles on something being unexplainable. 

Anyway, needless to say she started screaming. What's bazaar though is that these hands had substance and the experience lasted perhaps ten seconds before my sister got the shock out of her system and ran out to find an adult (my nan and mum met her in the doorway). I think that's a long time for a dream to hang around after waking, especially if you've been woken up because someone was touching your hair.

**Lead foot**
Mum and my uncle say that while in this bungalow (they used to hang out together a lot when they were younger and catch up for a couple of drinks on the weekend.), several times late in the night they would hear noises like someone walking on the roof. We live in Australia so possums are rife here but being so common you get to know the noise of a possum walking on your roof. This used to be accompanied by a hair prickling on the neck sensation my uncle especially would get. He still hates talking about it to this day. This stories interesting because it makes me wonder if whatever it was followed them.


**Townhouse**

The townhouse to my understanding was a pretty weird layout but maybe I've just not understood properly or imagined it wrong when they've told me about these stories. My mother lived here with my brother and sister where they often had my nan over and again my uncle. My nan claims to never have heard anything but my nans the kind of woman who would tell you the house next door wasn't on fire when it clearly was and deny it right up to her last breath if she thought it scared you (and perhaps because it scares her?). Anyway the only thing key you need to know about this house is that there was a hallway that circled around pretty much the entire floor plan, it went past the bedrooms, through the kitchen, down past the lounge room, around to the front door and then you were back on route to the bedrooms.

**Mr. Stompy**

As I said in the last story I wondered if what ever it was that was making the footsteps on the bungalow roof followed them because in this next house they had a spirit they affectionately and somewhat sarcastically refer to as 'Mr. Stompy'. Mr Stompy used to walk around the hallway over and over again in the middle of the night. According to my mother and sister it sounded like a man marching around the house.

**Angelas' experience.**

Angela used to sleep with her door open and she was terrified of Mr. Stompy. This particular night my nan was staying over, I'm not sure where she would sleep as I never knew the house. I know Angela has told me before but I can't remember. Anyway Mr. Stompy starts trucking around, stomping around the hallway which wakes her up except this night when he got to Angelas room he stops out the front of her open door. She's on high alert, this was unusual. So she called out to nan, who called back and told her there was nothing to be scared of, typical nan response and for that night Mr. Stompy stopped his pacing.

**Mums experience**

This was from another night, Mum woke up in the earlier hours of the morning to something breathing on her face and a weight on her bed. She freaked out and sat up turning on the light but there was nothing there. From my understanding this as well was super unusual because they lived in this house for a long time and there's only the three experiences I'm outlining that they've told me of where Mr. Stompy took a break from patrolling the hallway.

**Shanes experience**

I'm a little skeptical about Shanes experience as is mum and Angela because sadly Shane ended up being diagnosed with schizophrenia in his early teenage years so it's kind of cast a net of 'did it' or 'didn't it' happen over his experience but he's been pretty adamant about it when he's healthy so I'll put it in and you can decide.

Angela woke up one morning and was walking down the hallway towards the kitchen, at the end of this hallway was a big double door linen press. One of the doors of which opens and Shane crawls out. Angela asks him what he was doing in there and he looks a little white and confused and tells her that Mr. Stompy carried him out of his bed and put him in there. He then spent the entire morning furiously telling mum and Angela he wasn't lying.


**Misc**
 

**Africa**

When my sister was in Africa a couple of years ago she did the whole safari thing with her husband. They camped out under the stars many times with their guides. This particular night they stayed in a camp site where reportedly many men had been killed by lions. That night there was a terrific thunderstorm which was pretty intense but her and her husband were pretty tired so they fell asleep fast. She awoke at some point during the night to someone putting their hand on her ankle and moving her leg over out of the way. She propped herself up sleepily thinking it was her husband but then when a flash of lightning went off she realised he was dead asleep. 

Apparently their tour guides had warned then about ... I don't know what they're called but I liken them to bandits! who sometimes pray on tourists in the plains and steal things from their tents while they sleep. They were warned if they wake up to one in their tent they should pretend to be asleep because these men have been known to hurt or even rape or kill people who have tried to fend them off. So Angela slowly lays back down and the savannah is pitch black except for little glimpses of light when the lightning erupts. She laid there for hours praying and hoping there wasn't someone in the tent with them and if there was that they would just leave without hurting them. Eventually the sun came up and as dawn broke and the tent illuminated she could tell there was no one in the tent. 

With senses so alert for such a long amount of time in such a small space she surely would have known if someone unzipped and left the tent and her husband would had to have been stirring and stretched down to move her leg when she felt it. To this day she can't explain the experience in Africa and she gets visibly pale.

**Cats**

I just found out Wednesday after talking to Angela about my experiences with the animal that curls up on the end of my bed that she often feels cats jump up and run across her bed when she's going to sleep. She won't even be dozing yet and she'll feel it, open her eyes expecting it to be one of her two cats (which she keeps locked out of her room when she sleeps.) and ready to yell at them when she realises nothings there.

**Mum**

**Flemington**

We used to live in Flemington a couple of years ago, which I completely forgot until I went to type this but I used to hear someone running across the floor boards from the kitchen to my bedroom door at about 2am (I was a night owl back then, playing computer games all night.). Mum got really weird one day and I knew she was hiding something from me. She refused to tell me because she knows I'm a real scardy cat when it comes to anything that shouldn't be in my house, plus we'd had a break in through my window so I was pretty toey. Anyway eventually I got it out of her, she was laying in bed reading when she clearly felt a hand lean on the bed next to her. She said it even left an imprint. 

Oh man! that reminds me too! We had a family friend come live with us because her landlord was a dick and often in the middle of the night in our sun room (which her bedroom led off and where we kept our CD player) she would hear someone flicking though our CD collection. Once she pulled the blanket over her head and told it to 'fuck off and leave me alone' and it immediately stopped. Oh man, I can't believe I forgot that!


**Watergardens**

My mother and my sister live together again now. My sister has two children herself now and is renovating her house with her husband and mum wanted to help out while saving for a house so it suited them. About a month ago they heard a door open and close. No big deal, my niece gets up at least once a night because she's 3. Then footsteps were coming up the hallway, really light soft soled feet. At first my mum thought it was Hailey my niece but then she realised it sounded like they were wearing shoes and why would Hailey be wearing shoes at 10 o'clock at night? She turned to my sister who was sitting in bed with her (they have laptop parties with the electric blanket on in winter, lol) and Angelas white faced hearing it too. First thing they think of is intruder of course but it stops. Mum jumps up ready to fend off the intruder but when she peers down the hallway nothing is there. They do a scout of the house and nobodies entered, all the doors are locked and Hailey is fast asleep (My nephew is in a cot still so he couldn't get out and my sisters husband had stayed at his fathers house.). We were all on Facebook at the time and I've got to tell you, it was pretty great to listen to while it was going on! I had so many chills.

I actually had my own little experience with the hallway the other night but it was really windy so I'm not sure if it was just the wind though it sounded like it was coming from in the house (not a possum!!). I babysit once a week for my sister on my day off from uni and I was sleeping on the couch in the lounge room (at the end of the hallway) where I heard someone come jogging down the hallway. What makes me a bit weirded out was that I had my sisters cat sleeping on me and she lifted her head up as it happened and waited.


Anyway, that's part two for you. There's another story my mum has where she reckons she saw a UFO but I don't remember at all how it goes so I might post it another time. Sorry for the length, I tried to keep it as short as I could O.O haha.

I asked him to write about it but he says he will never share the story outside his friends because he's sure the being he encountered would not have liked it. I have to tell it though because it is one of the freakiest things I have ever heard.


My friend is a big astronomy freak. He loves to stargaze and knows more than the average person when it comes to space. So one time he and one of his buddies decided to go to the middle of bum-fuck no where to stargaze. They drove to a field where an abandoned farmhouse stood a couple hundred feet into the field. 

They decided to check it out, so they opened the door and went inside. They immediately felt as if they shouldn't be there, and while they scoured the first floor, they both heard whispers coming from the second floor. Then they heard footsteps coming down to ground level so my friend booked it out of the barn before his friend could. 

His friend didn't emerge as quickly though. Instead what my friend saw was a large legged creature that looked like a human, but roughly 10 feet tall LEAP from the second level of the barn and run across the field at an enormously fast pace. He said it was gray and naked, but had no genitalia.  

Then his friend came out of the barn with a look of shock on his face. When my friend asked him what he saw he said he didn't see anything, and to this day he denies that he saw anything in that barn...


My room mate is now extremely afraid of aliens and UFOs. He is certain he encountered one that night in that abandoned barn. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_z421l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/z421l/a_friends_encounter/,

So here it goes.


So, my grandparents on my mom's side have a nice country house that our family gathers every now and then, except them, who go every single weekend. Anyways, just to give you a setting, it's composed of 3 houses somewhat close together, the main one where my grandparents sleep, also my great aunt, my great-gran when she was still alive, and about 3 extra people. The other house is for my uncle's family to stay ( he has 3 kids, so he needs it) and the third is the guests house.


Anyway, I was there one weekend about 4 years ago, I was 14 at the time. It was kinda late, and my great-gran was chilling in the front porch (she was a little deaf and had poor memory, but she was hilarious, badmouthed and generally very alive, loved her) in a chair, and everyone was getting ready to sleep and whatnot. I was with my cousin watching tv when her dad showed up and told her to go get ready for bed. She then got up, looked through the tv room window which overlooks the front porch and the front of the property. There's a very long straight dirt road after the fences, sided by huge eucalyptus trees, and is quite eerie. She just stood there dumbfounded then asked her dad: ""Who are those people out there by the road?""


I had a mini freakout, but dismissed it quickly and continued to watch tv. Past 20 minutes or so, I went to the front porch to chill a little near to my great-grandma, and my grandma was there too. We were just laughing and chilling, when suddenly my great-gran just looks at the same spot my cousin looked, over the porch, into the dark road, and said, in a calm and assured tone: ""Oh, we are receiving guests today?"". Mind you, she was not even a bit senile at the time, and my grannie just goes ""No, don't think so.."".
Then my great gran goes ""No, we are receiving guests today, there's some people walking in the road, near the property door, they are visiting us!""


Do I need to say how much I freaked out?

**Pontianak**

The most common of *syaitan*.The *pontianak*(wraith) are often seen as very long haired females in a white dress.They normally come back for their revenge on their hated ones after death.They are also summoned for the same reason,to revenge against someone.Ugly women often resort to summoning them to make them become beautiful by letting them posses their body then go on a bloodthirsty rampage on beautiful women,and are almost unstoppable.

**Toyol**

The *toyol*(Imp?) is a *syaitan* that is often summoned to do theft as a revenge.They can steal money from almost anywhere,in full view,in a locked cupboard,or even when the victim is out of the country.They are seen as a small,green devil,and are summoned by doing a ritual with a human skull.A victim of a *toyol* theft once said that she heard 'laughing' or footsteps on their roofs before having something stolen.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_vbw17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/vbw17/an_explanation_of_malaysian_ghostsslightly/,

It was a nice two bedroom house in a small suburban neighborhood. We didn't start to notice anything strange until about a month of living there. The first thing we had noticed is that we would leave the house and upon return our radio and TV would be on at full blast. I dismissed it as electrical issues and we started unplugging the electronics before going anywhere. There were a number of times that we would come home and the oven would be on or a faucet running water. So after about three months of this craziness we did some research online and decided to try a Ouija board to contact this spirit and find out why it was so annoying.

 So the first night with the board we got no responses or anything. We tried again the next night with sucess we had contacted a spirit who claimed to be the previous owner, but was very elusive with its answers and gave bizarre answers. We decided to end the session and removed our hands from the thingy. At that point it slid off the table and across the room. I then threw that thing into the garbage outside. After the board things got worse. We heard voices just out of earshot, water ran on and off in the night, radio, TV, and computer all began to not work properly. The final straw for us was that I was mildly possessed (my wife says I cant validate this claim as I dont remember anything). She said I started mumbling in my sleep, and then i was speaking at full volume in what she said sounded like some kind of northern european langauge (I speak no other langauge than english) and then I just got quiet and fell back asleep.

This house was fairly small and GORGEOUS, (though at that age I very much doubt I appreciated the architecture...) and was built sometime in the late 1800's. 

The house was situated so that you walked in the front door and could see right down a narrow hallway, with doors branching off along the sides of it, each one leading to the bathroom/kitchen/TV room etc. One could easily place one hand on one wall of the hallway and touch the other without even fully extending their arms. My room was in the attic, which was accessed by a steep pull-down set of stairs situated at the very end of the hallway. My parents and baby sister slept in the bedroom on the main floor. My room was your typical attic: always cold and shoddily finished, with sloped ceilings that creaked with the wind and a small circular window overlooking the front yard. Despite the drawbacks, I was happy to have not only my own room, but my own LEVEL of the house, and I thought it was cool that instead of a door, I had a staircase (I figured I had more power over who was to enter my room that way.) My room was a short, narrow rectangle that ran the length of the house, as it sat directly above the hallway, though was about twice as wide. Directly opposite the entrance was my round window, and below it was where I situated my bed. I loved to look out the little window at the sky before I fell asleep.

One night, about a year after we had moved into the house, something woke me from my sleep. I was unconcerned, as the house was full of noises and sometimes they woke me up. But I remember feeling that I shouldn't to go back to sleep. I looked at my clock and it was shortly after two in the morning. I sat up and something I saw in my peripheral made me freeze immediately. Someone was standing at the other end of the room, by the stairs. I remember sitting as still as possible, not even breathing. I didn't scream or run or even turn on the light. I just sat there and stared, terrified. The person began to walk towards my bed, and as they got closer, I could tell that something was off. It wasn't a person, but I wasn't seeing a ghost either. They weren't glowy or see-through, but still somehow ethereal. As they got closer, I was able to discern the gaunt face and sad, dead, wet eyes of a young man. He wore a soldier's uniform from the civil war (I remember this being an important realization to me, though I couldn't tell you what side he was on.) The man's clothes were ragged and dirty, and as he walked over to my bed, he turned and looked at me. When he got to my little bed with the pink comforter, he turned and fell onto the mattress, as if he had been shot dead. But he never landed. He just disappeared right then and there. As I looked around in horror, the same man appeared at my doorway again and repeated the action again without fail. Then again. It was like a video was playing on a loop; each trip was identical to the last. This lasted about 15 minutes and then abruptly stopped.

The next night, the sad soldier returned. I saw him a couple nights a month until we moved, for unrelated reasons, a year later. My parents always thought I was telling stories, and nobody else ever saw the soldier but me.

I thought I could share a little encounter I had a few years ago. Compared to most things I read in this subreddit it's not exactly scary, so keep your expectations low.

For those who believe, I am what you call ""sensitive"". Since I was a little boy I have heard, seen and felt things out of the ordinary. You get the picture. Unfortunately, over the years, I've been shuting myself from all this, mainly because it scares the shit out of me. It's a shame, because, according to my girlfriend, I am very powerful and have amazing skills. This encounter is, lets say, diferent, because I hardly ever see. I tend to feel and hear. Thus what led me to share here with you.

I was about 14 at the time. One night I had been in my basement, wich is a sort of living room with TV and a computer. I turned everything off, closed the basement's door and started climbing the stairs. Since I was used to this little routine I didn't turn the lights on. When you reach the first floor, there is the kitchen door in front of you and the living room (another one) right next to it. It's door was open and was beeing iluminated by the moonlight coming through a window. As I was climbing the stairs, I saw it. Still and quiet, at the door, was a shadowy humanoid figure, completely black. In the moment I laid my eyes on it, it moved inside the living room. There I was, scared and frozen, still in the stairs, took a moment to compose myself and climb to the top of the floor. I entered the living room. I didn't want to, but I felt so atracted to it. I turned the lights on. And nothing. Sorry, that's it. I started talking out loud to an empty room, saying stuff like ""I'm not afraid of you, you have no business here, I can't help you"". I didn't sleep very well that night. It was the first time I was sure I saw something. I mainly just hear a lot of whispers and footsteps. What startled me the most is that it was completely pitch black. Everytime I feel something unusual it's never... good. Maybe it's just my fear that makes me see it that way. Anyway, I think it was the last time I saw something of the sort. I'm 20 today. Thanks for reading, I will answer any questions you may have.

Usually, I would wake up several times during the night for a few seconds to shift position, get more comfortable, etc. On this one particular night, I awoke at around 3am (I checked the time after the incident), ~~and felt almost frozen solid.. and I wasn't able to move.~~ Almost immediately after suddenly waking up, a strange feeling came over me. It's hard to explain, but the best I can do is compare it to the heart-stopping feeling you get for that split second after having dropped or knocked over something fragile before attempting to catch it. The feeling that came over me was as though I had dropped something onto the floor beside me, and that whatever that was, it was calling out to me. I knew that I hadn't, but even then, I felt the strongest urge to reach over the bed and retrieve whatever it was that was calling for me.. It consumed me. Mind you, even though I'm describing all of this, it all happened within a few seconds of having woken up.

Without thinking, and still being half-asleep and tired as hell, I finally gave in. I reached my arm out... That's when I felt it. The strongest force, grab onto my arm and tug on it REALLY hard, pulling me over the side of the bed! I immediately pulled my arm back, and backed away from that side of the bed. My heart was racing, and my hand a bit sore.. I felt it tingle for the next 5-10 minutes, as in I could still feel the area that had been tugged on. Obviously after I had calmed down a bit, I checked to see if I had in fact, dropped anything and 'lo and behold.. Nothing. I couldn't sleep nor even close my eyes for a second for the rest of the night. It still haunts me until this day, bothering me every night before I go to sleep.

Has anyone experienced such a strong encounter such as this before, and how did you deal with it? I'm just hoping to get some answers, because it's been bugging me ever since.

Could be explanation for ghosts?,itsallonme,16,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/l9tse/dis_consciousness_and_matter_as_a_possibility/,"So I've thought for a while that consciousness is the reason behind the universe. Its a really difficult idea to explain, so to put it as simply as I can: consciousness is the reason behind existence, rather than existence being the reason behind consciousness. Amit Goswani sums up this idea perfectly in the documentary ""The Quantum Activist"" (google it and watch it.) Consciousness creates possibility and the reality that possibility exists in. 

**""But wait! How does this tie in with ghosts and the paranormal?""** you ask. I'll tell you!

One of the main ideas that Amit Goswami postulates is that consciousness is separate from matter, that there is a greater consciousness, traditionally described as ""god"", and our consciousness is just part of a whole, separated only by our physical bodies. Perhaps what we think of as a ghost is actually just an imprint of possibility; what that persons consciousness would do if their body hadn't died. I'm really not explaining this well, sorry for that. 

EDIT: I just thought of something! Couldn't ""heaven"" be not having a physical body to weigh the consciousness down? Without real thoughts or emotions, things would be sublime. Following with this idea, life is a conduit of this consciousness, used to create and manipulate reality.

This isn't** *my* **story. But I trust the source. Not only was he a law enforcement officer, but also an ex-soldier. He's got a strong sense of right and wrong, justice, truth, and honor. 

This is his story.

*Frankly, I do not expect this to be believed. But I'm going to tell it anyway, simply because its been weighing upon my mind lately. I ran into Flash last weekend, who was back in town, and he spoke to me about it.*

*Knowledge of the physical environment is essential to an LEO in Patrol. It is one reason why seniority counts for a great deal in this line of work-the longer you work a given jurisdiction, the better you know it. And locals who become police officers quickly learn that growing up in an area does not mean you truly know it.*

*Part of it, is that an LEO, unlike most people, has no perception of private or personal space. We can go anywhere, given correct circumstances. And because of that, a great deal of 'idle time' or 'routine patrol' is spent exploring. Can you get a patrol car through the gap in this fence? Where does that track lead? Is there a way to get from this parking lot to another? If you walk this easement or power-line access, what will you see? This is essential, because at some point this knowledge can mean shaving thirty seconds off a response time, or catching a fleeing subject.*

*In every police jurisdiction of any size, in my experience, there is always at least one strange place. Not the spots you take rookies and play Find the Mud Hole, or the crime scenes you use to scare Explorers, but the real thing. The places that nobody talks about much. The places you don't find out about until you have to go there. The places you go to only if you have to. We have a place that is sometimes called the Patch. Its about thirty-five acres of very broken ground covered in scrub oak on the edge of town, completely isolated from everywhere else, out beyond an old brick plant that now makes clay pots. Nothing, as far as I can tell, have ever been built there, nor is it really good for anything. Its at the base of the tall ridge that currently marks the west boundary of our burg, cut by numerous gullies, and whose red-clay soil is about useless from growing anything.*

*The City seized it for taxes back in 1932 from a land company; it was listed as 'waste land' (no commercial use) back then.*

*Its really a strange place. I've been on search teams across it six times in eleven years, and every time I've been on it, it creeps me out. It gave me the willies when I first explored it shortly after being cut loose on my own; you can't get a car very deep into it, and frankly, a short walk on foot into it gave me such a bad feeling I never went back without a reason. It wasn't until about eighteen months later that I learned that I was not alone in my reaction to the place.*

*One factual thing that bothers me about the place, is that I get lost in it. I have, since I was old enough to think about such things, an unerring instinct about the direction north. I can always find it. Night time, snowstorms, forest, whatever; give me a few seconds to concentrate, and I know which direction north is. Even the desert, which screws many people up, never bothered me. And the Army taught me land nav to a fine degree; I've run compass courses with multiple dog-legs and hit my target location every time, even on featureless terrain such at Fort Hood, where one bit of scrub is identical to every other bit.*

*But every time I've been in the Patch, I've gotten turned around. In broad daylight, with a ridge line a quarter-mile away that is only a couple degrees off a true north-south axis. After the first search, I started taking a compass with me.*

*Near the center of the Patch is a structure we call the Playhouse. Its a building made out of sheets of old galvanized tin nailed to thick posts and four-by fours, with a dirt floor. We call it the Playhouse because there is absolutely no rationale for its positioning or design; firstly, you can't get a vehicle larger than an ATV or dirt bike to it due to washouts and gullies; maybe a jacked-up 4x4 if it was dry and you really did not care about your paint job.*

*Secondly, because the place is big (about 3000 square feet, as near as we can tell), but has no purpose. There's no animal pens near it, nothing; just a wood framework with tin nailed to it, no tar on the roof-seams, no doors (but several door-way sized openings), no windows at all. Inside its split into at least a dozen 'rooms' by either more tin sheets, or partitions made out of old packing crates from the railroad. Some of the rooms are completely isolated from the exterior walls.*

*There is no logic or reason to how the rooms are laid out; several have openings that are barely 3' high. It reminds you of how kids put together a fort or tree house. Except that this one has cut-down telephone poles for roof supports set several feet into the ground. Whatever else you can say about it, someone built it to last. There no junk or litter about the PH, and no graffiti; while its not very obvious, its been there since before the City seized the place, and with all the generations of kids, you would expect some beer-drinking, ghost-hunting, or general spray-can antics. Nor is there any sign of animals taking advantage of the shelter, nor have I seen any bird's nests, although hornet's nests and mud daubers are present. And it smells odd. That's all I can say about it: it smells different than what I think it should. This has been commented on by others, as well. No specific odor. Just odd. And flashlights fail in it. Yes, flashlights fail everywhere, but flashlights seem to fail a lot more in it than anywhere else. $70 Streamlight Stingers that are City-issue and have reliable rechargeable batteries go abruptly dead in there. And not in the usual fashion, the light going yellow for twenty minutes, getting dimmer and dimmer until they just fade away; rather, going from hard white light to dead in a minute's span. When you carry the same light every day for years, you know its battery in detail. Yet many of us have been caught by an unexpected dead battery in the Playhouse.*

*Some time in the past, we were searching for a missing girl. It was likely that she had been carried off by a recent high water after massive cloud burst (10"" in ten hours), but foul play was also a possibility, for reasons best unrelated. A search was mounted. I was tasked with taking two officers and checking the area around the old brick plant and the Patch.*

*I had two veteran officers, both entry team members and well-known to me; call them MD and Flash. They readily accepted my suggestion that we change into tactical gear in order to protect our uniforms from the brush; to be frank, I was less concerned with the brush, than for having an excuse to bring my MP-5 along. I wasn't alone in that, as unbidden, both Flash &amp; MD got their shotguns out of the arms room. Flash had a 14"" pump, and MD a Benneli semi-auto.*

*We searched the Patch first; and although all three of us were carefully keeping track of where we were in a place we had all been in before, we managed to get well and truly turned around twice in the space of ninety minutes. It took us a lot longer than it should have to search the area, because frankly, we weren't splitting up. At all. Anywhere else, we would have been twenty to thirty feet apart walking on line. Here, we stuck together. We had been on other search teams which had gotten got hopelessly jumbled and separated in the Patch before.*

*It was late afternoon when we went to the Playhouse. The sky was completely overcast, the color of lead. The ground was muddy, everything was wet, and there was a cold breeze out of the north. To say it was a miserable day was an understatement. We circled the Playhouse, looking for footprints, and found nothing. However, drainage was such that it was possible that they could have been washed away, so a search was necessary.*

*Inside, there were no gaps in the ceiling to speak of, and very few in the walls; the gray daylight hardly made its presence known through what gaps there were, although the dull light through nail holes made you think (unpleasantly) of animal eyes in the night.*

*I led the way in. Twenty feet in a portable metal detector (a wand type used to check for weapons) that Flash was carrying suddenly started beeping, and did not stop until he pulled the battery pack; he swore it had been turned off the whole time he had been out. Later, at the PD, it worked perfectly.*

*We were clearing the place like a hostile building, rather than a search; we had not talked about it, but all three of us were on edge. Very much so. The place smelled very wrong; not a smell of anything in particular, just not the way such a place should smell. I can't explain it any way better than that. I was on one knee checking out a closet sized-'room' when abruptly the light on my MP-5 died, going from white &amp; bright to dead in a couple seconds. Flash took point and MD center while I tagged along and switched batteries (I had a couple full-charged spares on me, as well as two more flashlights and some cylumes).*

*A minute or so later Flash's light died the same way, and he dropped to the rear to change out, while MD and I moved up a place. We stopped at that point, and we heard something. Flash muttered 'What was that?' and we all listened carefully. It was coming from ahead and to our right; we did not speak at the time, of course, but later, we never agreed on what it sounded like. To me, it had sounded like a sick cat might sound as it whimpers.*

*We moved forward towards the noise, and came to a largish room which had the exterior wall on one side. MD made entry, and at that exact moment his flashlight died. He immediately side-stepped and dropped to one knee; I moved in and past him along the wall as Flash slid along the wall on the opposite side of the 'doorway'. Flash was to the left of the 'doorway', MD was right, kneeling, and I was about two feet to MD's right . The room was about twenty by eleven, with us at the narrow side.*

*And something moved in the far right corner. Flash hit it with his light a second before I did; I remember MD yelling, and then both fired.*

*To this day, I swear I saw a big dark dog, I mean large, 150+lbs, bull mastiff-sized, in Flash's light, moving fast.*

*I fired, three-round burst, and then kept firing as MD and Flash pounded away. Both went empty and yelled that they were withdrawing (team procedure), and I fired to cover them as I backed out last. After the first burst, I couldn't see much for the muzzle flash, so I just ripped up the corner with three-round bursts. I fired off the full thirty-round mag.*

*In retrospect, I can not explain why I fired thirty rounds at a dog. There was no valid reason to simply hose it down; nor for Flash and MD to blaze away like we had. Nerves, is the only explanation I can offer. All I can say is that that encounter was quite simply the most stressful incident I have ever had, bar none.*

*In the second room, we reloaded, and MD switched out batteries. Then we re-entered the long room.*

*There was no dog. No body. No blood. Zip.*

*None of us described what we saw the same way. Flash was extremely reluctant to describe what he saw at all.*

*But there are a couple facts: all three saw a target 'in motion'. Despite the fact that we all perceived it as being in motion, we all saw it in a corner, and never shifted our point of aim, despite the fact that we all trained regularly on moving targets, MD &amp; Flash were hunters (I shoot lots of moving varmints), I served in military actions, and both Flash and I had been in fatal police shootings.*

*And we had twelve 12 gauge 3"" magnum hulls and 30 expended 9mm brass. Thirty bullets and 108 000 pellets were fired at a specific area, in this case an area consisting of a dirt floor and tin walls. All three of us were classified as expert shots. No matter how closely we, nor the two investigators who came out later, looked, we could find no hits on the floor, and only 23 projectile penetrations in the tin walls. Out of 138 projectiles fired (000 pellets are 0.36"" in diameter steel balls; 9mm bullets are roughly 0.38), 105 remain unaccounted for. The 23 holes we found were concentrated in the target corner; 9 to the left, 14 to the right of the corner, with the two groups 22"" apart at the closest. As if something solid between the two groups had soaked up the missing rounds.*

*The dept wrote the incident off as an 'accidental discharge'.*

*The girl was eventually found elsewhere.*

*Flash, MD, and I never really talked about the incident except indirectly. All three admitted having felt more stress than before or since. None of the three of us have been to the Patch since. Both MD and Flash have moved on to other agencies for unrelated reasons.*

*Thats all there is to it.*

That's part one. Of course, it raises questions.

*This is one story that doesn't get told around the station; in fact, aside from my wife, I've never told the entire story before. I told the others what I saw; MD shook his head and said it was leaner and longer; Flash flatly refused to say what he saw, then later said it was a dog and left it at that. He was the worst-shaken of all of us (not that MD or I were all that steady at that point), and he normally has nerves of steel.*

*that was one of the creepier things, later on: when we tried to explain the whole matter (and a firefight is not a joking matter to the police, no matter that no one got hurt), the administration members we were dealing with, who have been LEOs here for 40+ and 30+ years respectively, nodded, asked few questions, and **let the matter drop.** I did some digging; the company bought the property in 1881 as one of many parcels it picked up across three counties. The company went bankrupt in 1929 after the crash, and the properties within the City were taken for back taxes (the County got its holdings outside the city, likewise for taxes).*

*It was not built on after the City got it. The transfer documents list it as 'waste land', which in those days meant land with no apparent value or use. The 1881 purchase was made from another land company, who listed it as 'undeveloped; it was part of a section, or 160 acres, at the time. The actual property is 40 acres, but I don't know if 'the Patch' conforms entirely to that plat, or extends into what are the old brick plant holdings. It was surveyed in 1851, and was bought by various speculators beginning in 1857, ending up in the first land company in 1877. None of the transfers indicate anything but undeveloped land.*

*So far as I have been able to determine, there has been no use of the land. Certainly no road has ever been cut into the area, although a rail easement that has since been demolished would have made getting wagons or vehicles into the area easier. I would guess the Playhouse dates back to that period. The easement was in place from 1890 to around 1960, although it was not used after 1945, and probably impassable not long after that. It was eliminated completely, along with the removal of a couple culverts, in 1960.*

*The tin sheeting is flat, not the usual ripple style, suggesting pre-Depression stock, and a retired police officer told me that the support poles were telegraph, not telephone. He did not mention what was the difference, other than period. It was not a livestock operation, at least not one conducted properly. The reason I say that is there are no outside pens, and there are no pens, gates, or other barriers inside. Nor are here any signs that there ever were. There's just a framework, and sheeting, with the few wood partitions. Plus all the entrances, within and without, and the largest doorway-sized, some smaller. They would make moving animals very difficult. A squatters camp is possible, especially given the limited materials. The solid construction might argue against it, though. And the size. As to a much earlier question, I'm not aware of any photos. No cameras were ever present on any of the trips made there. Not the sort of place you want to remember.*

Looking for answers - 

*the chemical angle has some merits- during WW2 our county hosted one of the largest training facilities in the USA, and chemical weapons (mostly mustard gas) were tested and deployed here. Numerous Chemical Corps units were formed and trained here. The EPA, for local gov't, would be more frightening than a breach in the time/space continium and hordes of Undead pouring through.*

*One point- the place did not smell bad, but rather, it did not smell the way such places usually do. Of course, there were no animals living there, so the rotting feces scent and various musks were absent, which could be it. Chemicals or spills could account for animals not liking the place. Fumes could also account for why I get lost, and why we felt uneasy. It could also explain why it was built so solidly. Certain fumes also disrupt electrical connections, I recall from Army NBC training, by causing minute surface contamination of the connectors. Come to think of it, we never re-tested the batteries once outside-we just put them in chargers. And the spring-loaded charger connections are intended to clean the battery terminals. And, of course, for the military, no site is remote. And back during WW2, access to that area was much easier.*

*Another thing, back in those days, there was no EPA-you dumped stuff wherever you felt like it. Lots of possibilities.*

*You know, its all getting pretty simple for me: the design of the Party House makes perfect sense. A solidly built structure with no doors, no window openings, and an implausible interior layout: a gas chamber. A place where you run troops in wearing chemical gear, to be exposed to tear gas (or other weapons) in order to learn that their gear works, and how to function while wearing it. Residual chemicals would drive off animals; chemical fumes could account for a sense of disorientation and discomfort. They trained here from 1939-45, very intensively; up to 100,000 troops at any one time. That would account for the 'wrong' way the place smelled.*

*Another thought that has occurred to me since the whole chemical thing, is that we were firing into a corner. Its possible that the first hits forced the tin sheets back from their supports, creating an opening. Firing in the dark, as I noted, means that after the first shot or burst, your night vision is gone (and we were using flashlights anyway). The weak sunlight would not have been easily noticed. Nor was it a lengthy undertaking; Flash had five shots to pump out, MD seven semis, me ten three-round bursts. It would have come as a continuous volley in the space of seconds. If that happened, the bulk of the rounds could have passed through the gap. When the shooting stopped, the sheets sagged closed again. Given the earnumbing effects of shooting in an enclosed space, we would not have heard anything. If I recall correctly, the missing rounds were at the apex of the corner, where the inside 'wall' sheet of tin met an exterior sheet of tin.*

*We did walk around the outside of the building to make sure no rounds had hit anyone (tin sheets do not stop anything), but I do not recall specifically locating the exit points. Especially since we were waiting for investigators-you don't screw with the scene of a shooting, regardless if you hit anything, or not. Besides, at the angle we were firing, the rounds would have gone some distance before hitting ground. If the investigators made the same assumption that we did: that the sheets were firmly fixed, it could explain the whole matter.* 

*then and now, Chemical Warfare specialists are routinely exposed t a full range of chemical weapons while in full chemical gear. This is done to get them used to hostile environments, to teach them that their gear works, and the like. The US uses weaker than normal chemicals, but for example, between 1980-89 14 US servicemen died in such training exercises. The USSR routinely expected 1% losses when training with chemical weapons. Of course any training exercise can cause deaths; at one summer AT the 49th Armored (TXNG) had 11 training deaths in a two-week period. Aviation units always lose people to crashes, and vehicle accidents always take a toll as well.*

*The place was definitely not set up in the manner of defensive works, however. Not even as simulated works. The military camp near our burg trained a lot of Chemical Corps units during WW2. The Net and some of my own books has given me a lengthy list, and confirmed the fact that there was training with 'live' chemical weapons. I've e-mailed some of the unit veterans' associations, but I'm pretty confident the whole matter has a logical explanation.*

And more recently: 

*The Playhouse is no more. I did some Net research, and it turns out there was a lot of chemical warfare training done n our area. I brought my findings to the City, and they shrugged it off-but they did accept the hard copies.*

*A couple weeks later, without any fanfare, the City re-opened the accessway, punched a road in, tore down the Playhouse, and ripped the whole area up. They dug a massive hole in the middle, which was then leased to a local factory for disposing of ceramic debris. I've driven to the edge. It looks like its been strip-mined, because they are systematically digging big holes, pouring in ceramic shards, and covering them over. In a few years it'll be flat and several feet higher than the area used to be. It certainly doesn't have the same feel to it.*

And Finally, 

*A further update: The Patch is stripped of vegetation other than grass &amp; low brush; its pretty flat, as the dumping, digging, and filling has leveled it all out, although its probably several feet higher on the average. They've built a warehouse on one edge, and survey crews have marked it all out; with the boom that's hit our burg, it'll probably be a mall or something in the next few years. I've walked and driven around it. Nothing special in feel.*

*Maybe toilet shards act as inter-dimensional insulation? The only creepy thing remaining: I asked one of the investigators if they checked the tin walls to see if they were loose. They had checked; the tin wasn't loose.*

*I said, ""that's odd.""*

*He said, ""Not for that place.""*

*And it ended there.*

And still more recently (I like to follow up on things):

*Its smaller, now; the City sold it, and a factory complex lopped off about a sixth, and most of the rest is fenced, since the dirt they used to cover the shards is better than the old red dirt, and they graze some horses there. They put a major water main through it recently, and I expect it to be built up within a year or two, given the city growth.*

*I walked across it a couple times for various reasons. Its nothing unusual anymore-just open field. No getting lost, no battery failure, no 'feel' to it at all, zip. One point to support my chemical theory: when they dug the holes, they hauled the dirt off; the dirt used for cover &amp; raising the ground level was trucked in. Very unusual.*

*The red dirt they hauled off has not shown up at any of the City's various sites, including the huge dump complex. Nor was it sold as fill.*

Afterwards I collapsed.

Few years later, I wake up and get breakfast and my roommate is being weird. She asks me if I am ok. ""Of course I am ok, why do you ask?"". She proceeds to tell me that the night before she heard a huge argument in my room, she heard three furious voices one of them a female voice, and none of them my normal voice. She opened the door and found me sleeping (I am a very deep sleeper). She couldn't tell me what language though. 

Third time, I wake up and discover my girlfriend in the living room. She was apparently freaked out when I sat up, grabbed her and told her ""I see the nuns. I see the nuns"", before collapsing (this time in English).

(UFO related) ",booberryskry,16,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/k3uc7/advice_in_deciphering_a_strong_silent_childhood/,"Hello! First post as a redditor :) have to say this sub is awesome. Usually had to dig through a lot of stuff to find these types of stories,  information etc.

Anyhoo, the story I'd like to speak to has been an intriguing one that has stuck clear in my mind since childhood. I have told only my family about it, years later for some reason that I'll get into later, and have never been able to find anything similar to negate my experience with.  
  I was about 7 or 8 at the time, living with my mom and sister in a small farmhouse with a lot of property (corn fields) surrounding.  The house itself never seemed to have haunts, but the land around the place did have some strange uneasiness to it, especially on certain nights. This could be a completely different post, but metallic, feminine screaming and strange-sounding machines running late at night in the middle of a dense forest were just some of the things I've seen/heard around the area since we started living here.   OK, back on track...

So I distinctly remember waking up in my bedroom with a sense that I had to get up and see something. No one else was in the room and I'm a heavy sleeper so this wasn't usual for me.  I also remember being very inclined to look out of my bedroom window, one that faced a part of my field, the barn, and a woodsy area.  As I stepped up to my window I saw something unexplainable, in short.  It was a bright large sphere of orange light, probably 50-60 feet in diameter, hoovering outside about 250-300 feet away from me.  It was odd in many ways, it was a deep beautiful orange light, similar to if you put an orange scarf over a light fixture... it glowed, but also  reflected ABSOLUTELY no light onto any other surrounding surface. A large tree was about 50 feet from one of the edges, and I remember thinking how I've never seen a source of light that keeps all of its glow to itself.   It also wasn't simply a sphere (or circle for that matter, couldn't tell), the perimeter of this strange glowing circle resembled a saw blade. The edges seemed to form little waves that dipped in and out, and this was very visible from where I was standing so each edge must have been around 5 or 6 feet I'd say. Also, this orb was moving, sloping downwards in a linear fashion, like it was trying to go slowing to ground level (it was about 100 feet in the air).  I also remember being confused with the motion because the rotation of the blades (moving counter-clockwise) seemed to be in opposition of the downward, leftward motion of the.. thing. 

Aside from this, a few other things about this event are marked with some strangeness.  I clearly know I was not scared, nor asleep when I saw this.  I was about to get my sister, when I felt this comforting feeling that basically would have said with words ""don't show this to anyone, or tell anyone, it's special and it's for you.""  There was also a low, humming sound that was accompanying this orb-thing.  sticking with that notion that this this was projecting onto me, I told no one that night, the next day, or for the next 3 years I'd say.  I've had other ufo-related adventures and have lived in some pretty damn haunted houses so since then I've seen some shit. But nothing comparable to this.  Advice from anyone, fireball seems relevant, but I've looked into it and I just don't think that settles it...

After I saw her for the first time, things started to get real intense. It kept getting more aggressive; more noises and objects actually falling down. Before this I would hear things fall but, upon inspection, nothing was out of place. Now, things were falling down and moving quite frequently.

I ended up naming her Betsy, and she seems to love to play hide and seek with me. Every time I sit down to write down at the front desk I will see her out of the corner of my eye, down the hallway. She'll start to quickly move from one side of the hallway to the other, as if taunting or playing with me.

One night, I was in the employee lounge taking my break. I was eating and sitting at the table, facing the doorway. Suddenly, I saw a solid black shadow run past the doorway. This freaked me the fuck out and I got up to look out to the hallway. Nothing.

I was once told by a nurse that she's heard a baby crying in Operating Room B. I never really believed her and thought she was trying to scare me, so I just put it in the back of my mind and ignored it. Until one night. At around 5 am, I was passing by Operating Room B and C and I heard the baby crying, loudly. I stopped and listened. It sent chills down my spine so I walked by faster. The weird thing about this is that this room is located on the external part of the hospital. This means that there's nothing on the other side of it's walls.

A while back, a group of workers were sitting around talking and joking. As they were laughing, one of the older nurses suddenly stopped mid-laugh; terrified. They asked her what was wrong and she said she saw a black shadow at the end of the hallway.

Sometimes I will hear stomping on the roof above me. But, the roof above me is about 3 feet lower than the actual floor to the 3rd floor. So between the floors, there's a 3 foot gap of nothing.
Yet another night, at around 3am, I was heading back upstairs after taking a patient to his room. I am on my way to the elevators, as I turned the corner, I saw the elevator doors closing and a girl in a black hoodie walk quickly into the elevator. I called out to her to please hold the doors for me. As I reached it, the door closed. I was slightly annoyed. Then, without pushing any buttons, the doors opened. It was empty. I suddenly realized that if anyone would've passed through the elevator doors whilst they were closing, they would've stopped and opened again, because of the security sensors. This did not happen. The doors kept closing while she was walking into the elevator. I got on it, feeling pretty damn rattled.

Things were quiet for some time. The atmosphere felt a lot lighter and I was glad. They started up again a while ago.

I was walking towards the back, to the autoclave. And as I rounded the corner and walked into the room, there she was. Standing about 5 feet in front of me. She wasn't solid but she was covered in some black ""material"". Sort of like the typical Muslim clothing, which really makes no sense given where I live. I was at the doorway when I saw her, she seemed to be holding a hand up. I immediately stopped, whipped out my phone and snapped a quick picture, then backed away and back into the hallway and to the front desk. I was NOT going in there. Just seeing her there made every single hair on my body stand on edge. I had to go back into the room a while later, but thankfully, she was gone. I think what hurts the most of this story is that I had 2 pictures that CLEARLY depicted her. And that phone was destroyed. I think I might have those pictures backed up somewhere, I just have to find them. My girlfriend almost couldn't believe they were true. You could see her face and even her hairstyle. Very faintly, but still there.

Sometimes while I'm on the graveyard shift, I will talk to my girlfriend on Skype. We just sit around and talk to each other via webcam, sometimes it helps me feel less alone. On one occasion, I got up and told her I was going downstairs to the ER to take some supplies. As I usually do, I left the webcam running, so she could be on ""Betsy Watch"". According to her, the camera started to violently shake. She compared it to a camera being shaken up by a category 8 earthquake. It was that strong. She thought it was me who was trying to freak her out and says it went on for over a minute and a half. Then heard the main door open, and it suddenly stopped. Then I arrived and popped into view. That's when she asked if I was the culprit. I wasn't.

I just remembered that around 8 or so months ago, I was walking down the hallway towards the front desk, it was around 5am. I distinctly heard a male voice boom: ""Good Morning"". Startled doesn't even describe what I felt. I might've needed an underwear change.

Everything I type hereafter is built on conjecture and anecdotes; there are no hard facts and likely there never will be. Still, I find it important to share the following due to my own loss of sleep over my recent discovery over events happening where I live.

This is a long post. I'm telling my story from the start. It's not meant to entertain as much as to just get it out there.

My morbid curiosity started it all. A few years ago after I moved back to the US from overseas I worked at a temp job where I did truly next to nothing at all. It was a 40-hour-a-week paid lunch break with internet access. It was only supposed to last a month, but ended up lasting a year. It started with something close to 16 workers, but quickly dwindled down to just two of us.

The other co-worker who hung on was an ex-journalist for a semi-prominent newspaper in his 50s whose life was ruined after being busted for tax evasion. He told some wildly entertaining stories on everything from dining with relevant political figures, underground gay culture in the 70s and 80s (he was openly homosexual), and drug use to UFOs, Bigfoot, and other 'Paranormal' phenomenae.

Around that time, my boredom had me looking for haunted sites in the local area. After some searching, I asked him about a lonely stretch of road outside of the city that popped up quite a bit on my searches. It's been called 'Spook Road' for some time. The ex-journalist was familiar with it and used to frequent it with his friends in the 70's.

He attributed his encounter out there to Bigfoot, which I still find pretty humorous somehow. He felt strongly enough to submit his encounter on a website he read nigh daily for a while. It's available here:

[http://www.gcbro.com/SDminnehaha0001.html](http://www.gcbro.com/SDminnehaha0001.html)

If you didn't click on it and read it, I suggest you go back and at least look at the last bit of his account.

Later anecdotes collaborated the ex-journalist's story, though none attributed the thing encountered with Bigfoot and instead to a 'demonic' entity. I'll address the procession of pointy-hatted figures in a bit.

I did some research of my own and pulled up a highway patrol report online; once they were publicly available, but now they're long gone. The report was dated January 3rd, 2003:

&gt; ""A Trooper responded to a report of a vehicle in the ditch on Sale Barn Road (also known as Spook Road). Upon arrival, he learned that the vehicle had been forced off the road by a second vehicle that was tailgating it. The vehicle was so close to rolling over that the Trooper had to hold onto the bumper while the driver got out. While  speaking with the driver of the second vehicle, the Trooper learned that the occupants had been at an abandoned farmyard. The driver said they saw ""something"" which scared them and they left in a hurry. While driving west, the driver said that a name suddenly appeared on the windshield and she felt ""a force"" seize her head and push it against the driver door window. The driver admitted following the car very closely, saying they wanted to get away from the farmyard. The driver of the second car was cited for following too close and the lead vehicle was pulled from the ditch with a wrecker.""

Furthermore on an absolutely awful site, another account attests to the odd events at a particular graveyard and the presence of a cult in the area. The rest of the it is underwhelming, cliched, and poorly written; par for the course with 'eyewitness' accounts.

The above-mentioned account is located here (pages 4-5):

It was enough to make me seek to break my own boredom with a jaunt out there.

The road is hilly and cuts through a river that snakes through it five times, hence five bridges across the same river. The popular myth often told is that going down the road one way you'll encounter all five bridges, but on the way back you only encounter four. While some are quick to point out that the average person may forget to count the first bridge on their way back.

I called up my good friend from college and decided to head out one summer night to see for myself. Having seen some odd things in his own time, we were both already bit shaky after he shared those stories. Nevertheless, we only managed to spot quite a few deer, an onslaught of nocturnal flying insects from hell, and all five bridges both ways.

We made up for it by sharing a few more scary stories, and called it a night.

I let it go at that.

I was unceremoniously cut from my do-nothing job with little notice and switched over to one of a far busier nature. I began pursuing my Master's degree and my wife had our son.

I made mention one day of finding it incredible that I was actually researching Satanism and the Satanic panic dealing with purported ritual murders and abuse back in the 80's. One of my co-workers there perked up at this, which was odd as he rarely showed interest in anything. Mind you, the kid is not creepy in the least, but is just there to work and then go home and do things typical of his age.

I finally found time to ask him what interested him about the articles on Satanism I was reading, and he stated there were Satanist groups in this area.

I am not a Christian and am quite aware that LaVeyan and Setian Satanists are about as harmful and socially dangerous as a fart in a crowded room. I told him as much and he clammed up.

It bugged me that he so quickly clammed up like I shut him down. Apparently he had more to say on it. I asked him again later and he said we'd need more time. After we got off work, we discussed it.

He told me there were groups in the area that were practicing 'black magic'. I thought on this and recounted the story my friend had told me about those 'pointy-hat' figures processing through the field at Spook Road.

He nodded his assent, and continued to tell me about his encounters there. He made is clear that he had driven up there hundreds of times with nothing happening, but every so often things became more than simply a little creepy, but downright terrifying.

He said that sometimes after crossing the fifth bridge, on the way back the road changes completely and strange figures move in the woods lining the suddenly winding road. He reported sometimes feeling like getting out of the car was a good idea and encountered people that made him feel like everything they said was a good idea. Sometimes he felt like he couldn't catch his breath and apparently his eyes changed colors shortly after returning form this 'other' road. He also reported seeing a white van that maintained the same distance no matter what speed they drove at as someone peered out form the back window at them.

I asked him about the van and he told me that it was apparently the one they used to transport their human sacrifices that took place at a barn that was converted to a ritual workspace.

Up to this point I had been skeptically amused, but the idea of people being sacrificed got to me. I asked for more details. He told me that they take people and sacrifice them for their 'black magic'. Apparently this included infants (probably born within the members of the group).

I was appalled at this idea and my stomach twisted in knots.

He went on to tell me that he had been followed on some nights from Spook Road and that he still saw the same cars idling by his house from time to time. He firmly believed that these groups were not small, but involved prominent figures in local political and governmental society.

Despite the knots in my stomach, I maintained my skepticism. I don't simply subscribe to conspiracy theories and believe in seriously questioning the possibility and potentiality of anything while not accepting any conclusion until it clearly presents itself (or satisfyingly enough to convince me, anyways).

My later discovery of an article addressing accusations of Satanic Ritual Abuse in terms of law did little to assuage my fears. How could such a thing be so prevalent as to require an article from an officer in this area finding it necessary to actually address the issue with an essay? The article is located here:

[http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume6/j6_1_2.htm](http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume6/j6_1_2.htm)

Returning to the conversation with the kid, he went on to talk of members of the group being able to 'astrally project' and stalk individuals in dreams. He ended by inviting me to go out. My morbid curiosity initially had me accepting, but as I thought about it my mind soured on it.

The whole thing sounded ridiculous to a rational mind, yet something about it kept me up that night. I discussed it with my wife, and while she has a stricter skepticism than I do, the idea of a group that follows you home and sacrifices infants immediately resulted in the typical and irrational (perhaps not?) fear of a parent for the safety of our child.

I told the kid I wouldn't be joining him due to the admittedly over-cautious fear for my newborn son.

I still couldn't sleep though. The idea of something so plainly 'unnatural' actually existing outside of the bounds of a story terrified my mind, which was built on the psychology-minded basis that one's perception was the sum of one's 'reality'; that we are equipped to define reality as we see fit for our experience. That something existed outside of those bounds and was capable of effecting anyone regardless of what they believed... well, that was terrifying.

I went to my brother to discuss my fears. He was working on his doctorate in psychology and had already given successful counseling to patients. We are both rather intelligent, but his worldview tends to be more pragmatic than mine. I needed sound reasoning as to why believing any of this was ridiculous.

As I told my story, I was shocked to find my brother finishing it for me, and his face was rather grim as he described the barn, the sacrifices, etc. in much the same detail. He had been conducting his own personal research on the same phenomenae due to one of his patients apparently being a victim of one of these groups.

The patient manifested as classic ritual abuse victim, including dissociative identity disorder where the alter identified itself as a 'demon'. My brother is far less skittish than I am, and when he described the 'flip' to the alter as being 'rather unsettling, the hair stood up on my arms', my eyebrows rose. He told me little else due to his strict adherence to confidentiality agreements.

I've spoken with others who have been out on Spook Road and also reported the road changing and becoming terrifying. Another co-worker and friend admitted to going out there and refusing to ever go back due to an occurrence where the road 'changed' on the way back.

I later changed jobs again to my current job and was recently in a conversation with a co-worker who mentioned the Midwest US as being a prominent place for Satanist activities. She said this in the sensible context of a conversation of wholly different and ligher subject matter without provocation or knowledge of all that has been discussed here. I found the knots gathering in my stomach again. Once again, a similar story of a past job with counselors dealing with victims of the groups in the area and sacrifices. 'Astral projection' and 'dream-stalking' came up again.

Again, I am not a Christian and hold no beliefs regarding the spiritual nemesis of that religion, but is something happening out there on that road? Are people being hurt? Does the 'supernatural' element of this all exist?

I did end up going back out, though prior to 6 PM. My wife was against it, but is open-minded and doesn't believe in dictating my actions.

The kid agreed to take me and another mutual co-worker who had nothing better to do out to Spook Road, the barn, and another state park location where he encountered some folks who had a strange quality that made everything they said sound like a good idea.

Why did I take the other co-worker along? I stated my reasoning was to have an outside view to ground us. On some level that was true, but paranoia was really the greater reason. I had never talked to the kid outside of work, how could I be sure I could trust him? So, along came the third party.

We went to the barn first. On Google Earth you can find it at **(43°34'14.62""N,  96°41'8.71""W)**. This is supposedly one of the locations where the rituals of the cult in question take place. Clearly deserted, it was filled with graffiti typical to any abandoned building located close to town. Some Satanic symbolism and blatantly offensive graffiti was painted on the walls, but I found them to be a bit childish to consider as evidence of human and infant sacrifice as much as a bored high school student's afternoon with friends.

While up in the loft, we did note that there was a lot of superfluous twine everywhere. While the kid initially led me to believe they were red and crunchy from blood, I found them to be made of a certain plastic fiber that is 'crunchy' and flat. Still, I couldn't puzzle out what purpose the copious amounts of twine would serve to any squatters.

And there was evidence of squatters, though seemingly long gone. Why would squatters hang out in a dilapidated old farmhouse with at least inklings of 'Satanic' goings-on attached to it?

As I walked across the loft, I did discover one inherently dangerous quality of the place; the floor caved in on me. I am in excellent shape and enjoy rock climbing, so as my co-workers expressed surprise, I calmly caught myself on the support beams and lifted myself back out. I berated myself for nearly costing my family a lot of money and potentially endangering my son's father's life, but was completely nonplussed otherwise. I only make note of this for later comparison to my emotional/physical state at another location.

The interesting feature of this barn that we noted after I fell through was that other parts of the floor were neatly refurbished with new wood and had strong support, parts that ran along where the bulk of the twine was located. Why would an abandoned barn need new (and incredibly well installed) flooring in a loft? Are squatters so industrious?

But where was the altar, the candles, etc? Surely an active group would leave some evidence of their comings and goings other than twine and a nice, new floor?

Indeed. A cult whose presence is reputed to go back decades would be smart enough to keep their tools of the trade mobile. If I had discovered an altar, I would have been more convinced of a hoax. There is a fine book by Robert Wang outlining how to make a hidden and easily portable temple that blends right into home furniture and storage to suit the needs of the modern magic(k) practitioner.

The book may be found and purchased here:

We moved on to Spook Road.

It's actually kind of pretty in daylight during autumn. For a winter daylight view of the road, you can click the following link:

The kid was adamant that we couldn't be out there past 6 P.M., as that's apparently when the unpleasant things start to occur. We made our way down the road without any event until the fifth bridge. I suddenly became ill to my stomach and felt an irrational fear. This did not match up with my mental state, which was calm. The graveyard we mentioned required some backtracking, which we did on foot.

As we explored the graveyard, the kid reminded me that the entity that was responsible for the haunting of the road was bound to a location in the graveyard that the kid described as an old cut down tree. We had plenty of time to spare, but the sight of the sun going down made me queasier.

We puzzled over a dead shrub with plastic flowers tossed into it as being the supposed place of 'binding', and I admit feeling underwhelmed. Then we looked over at the northwest corner of the little graveyard where a huge felled tree had been cut down and sawed apart. Supposedly, this place of binding was also where some of the bodies of the infants sacrificed were disposed of.

We walked up to it and my queasiness increased. We all remarked on the oddity of a discarded and rather new looking can of lighter fluid that had obviously gone unused sitting on the ground next to the large bracken. Had some rather dangerous prankster chickened out?

We all peered into it and saw what we all agreed looked like a path into it. None of us could make a step forward and we all laughed at it. And still didn't take a step forward.

I shook my head and asked the kid to go down and take a look. My guts were roiling and I was honestly terrified. I had nearly fallen through the floor of a barn earlier without rattling my nerves in the least, but a cut down tree sitting in a tiny graveyard managed to scare me to the point of immobility?

Let me stress, this tree looked old. It is not expensive to get rid of one felled tree.

If you have Google Earth, you can see what I'm talking about at  **(43°33'35.06""N,  96°32'14.58""W)**. Open up your historical imagery by hitting the icon of a clock with an arrow going counter-clockwise. Go to 5/22/2005. Looks like the tree is standing. The imagery is fuzzy in the years following, but in 7/7/2007 it looks a bit rounder. By perhaps 9/7/2007 and definitely 10/5/2008, it looks very dead.

This tree didn't look like it was harming anyone, why cut it down? And, as I noted, removing a tree from isn't terribly expensive, why leave it to rot for years?

The kid said it looked like he could go further in, but I bade him to not do so. We all decided to leave and look at one more location.

As we were leaving, the kid decided to show us where he had found a perfectly round bit of sand that was very out of place and a sheriff drove by. The third party made his worth questionable when he, for some reason, decided to hide behind a tree. The sheriff stopped and asked what we were up to.

Apparently I had gotten my nerve back, and I stepped forward and said we were just out for a walk. The sheriff then asked why the third party had hid behind the tree. I responded that he had made a poor choice of joke at seeing a sheriff drive by, and that we were just messing around. He told us to cause no trouble and left.

I wondered why a sheriff would need to patrol so lonely a stretch of road, but in all honesty we were the reason; kids out looking for a scare and causing trouble in the erstwhile.

We moved on to the last location, the Gitchie Manitou State Reserve. Though we were pushing the time at this point. We parked at **(43°30'1.65""N,  96°35'29.83""W)**, and no one else was there (it was very cold at this point, so it was understandable). We traveled throught the woods at a fast walk without event to this location:  **(43°29'54.02""N,  96°35'52.02""W)**. Supposedly black hooded figures had been spotted at this ruined, historical structure and other had seen fit to cover it in graffiti. The kid later claimed he saw a shadowy figure following us here, but did not tell us at the time. I remain especially skeptical of that last bit.

He then bade us visit a pond with odd qualities of being perfectly still despite inclement weather **(43°29'57.15""N, 96°35'37.16""W)**. As we looked out at it and all agreed it was remarkably still, we heard voices and saw flashlights across the pond. We weren't sure why they were there, but we were spooked. It was a week night, it was now getting dark, and it was very cold. As they heard us, they went quiet.

I was surprised to find that we all agreed to run away. We saw their truck parked to ours and noted binoculars sitting in the passenger seat (we likely noted this out of mounting paranoia).

I understand that this is not precisely the scariest story ever told, but the other co-worker asked us to never bring him along again. I had previously measured him to be an unafraid skeptic, but was surprised to find him admitting to having been quite scared.

This is all I've done so far, and I am convinced that going out there at night may be dangerous in some manner.

Please share your thoughts.

UPDATE: I got a few missed calls and a message stating the kid had gone hiking down in the area and located human remains. These remains could be more archaeological due to the Native American tribes that dwelt in the area, but he believes it's linked to the disappearances and sacrifices this group is supposedly responsible for.

I have a family and have decided to no longer have anything to do with any possible cult activity that involves harming people. When you have a joyful little child, completely dependent on you for all its needs, who you love more than anything with a woman you love more than anything, you just can't bear the thought of ever risking anything (no matter how implausible) that would so overtly jeopardize the incredible bond that grows instantaneously between all members of a family that loves each other so very much.

A friend of mine lived in a house that was very haunted so im just going to make a list of strange happenings that occurred in the 2-3 years he lived there. 

When he first moved there nothing really weird happened to make us think the place was haunted until about 4-5 months in me him his brother and sister and mom all heard whispers and small things of that nature but never said anything about it just ignored it until it would get worse and worse so we started sharing our stories with one another but nothing really bad.

About a month later they got 2 dogs from a friend a German Sheppard and a pit/lab mix they went to pick them up and when they entered the house almost immediately they went for one spot on the hardwood floor and started clawing at it and no one could figure it out it was very weird and every now and then they would just go and claw in the exact spot for like 5 mins at a time and quit until by the time they moved there was almost a hole in the floor.

Another weird thing that happened was me and my friends mom were hanging out watching t.v my friend at school i was waiting for him to get home me and her were the only ppl there for sure his dad was at work and there is no way up the stairs without going through the living room where we were. so we were watching t.v and all of a sudden we hear his dad's voice from upstairs say ""HEY WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOUR DOING"" we looked at each other and because we both knew for sure no one was there we bolted out the front door and didn't go back in for a few mins it was very creepy.

Another occurrence  another friend of ours came over to see his new house he had lived there for almost 1 year now if not a lil longer this is the only account of physical contact that i know of. He went upstairs to see his room and we left him there for just a second to get us all something to drink on our way back he ran down the stairs screaming and when he calmed down he showed us his back which had 5 or 6 large scratches on it a couple were starting to drip with blood we all freaked out and he never came back over.

And here is the topper this inst really an occurrence as it is just part of the house after staying there for a while we had heard from someone that lived there for a very brief time that a man lived there at one time and he went mad and locked his wife and daughter under the stairwell chained them down under there and tortured them before going upstairs and blowing his own brains out. well this sparked our curiosity so we ripped part of the carpet out in his room and there it was bloodstains and upon further inspection of the stairwell you could see claw and teeth marks in the wood which really freaked us out because that's the one place in the house that is the most creepy it just fills you with dread.

well that's about all i can really remember besides small things like whispers or the dogs barking at nothing for several mins at a time i hope you guys like this it is my first post here and i just had to share with you guys my stories

Anyway, description… I live at the end of a road, maybe six or seven houses slash properties away from the dead end of it. From the first point you can turn off of the road I live on to another, differently named street, is all thick forest. Briars, snakes, giant spiders, trees two men thick to saplings the width of my fore arm, which is roughly four inches, and all that jazz. I live literally a football field away from the actual paved road, most said football field length being a rock-spread drive way, which the middle bit is thick grass. Pretty much what would pass for a wealthy drive way in a backwater town, which is pretty much what I live in.


There’s several paths to the forest, just on my side of the street, within a tenth of a mile of my house. I normally take the one furthest away from my house. It’s through the side of one of my friends house. She’s since moved, but I still use the path out force of habit, and both houses on that property being uninhabited, and abandoned to the point that someone still owns it, pays taxes and such, but no one lives in it, or repairs it. I knew the people in both houses before they were ‘abandoned’, plus the owner of the property, so I’m not doing anything illegal when I use that path.


Description done. Okay, told you I had a habit of ranting, remember? Yep. That was a small example. Short turned into three paragraphs. Damn it. |:


I go out to this… plateau type rock formation in the woods at least twice a months, many times more. I don’t  go back there alone, not because I’m afraid of anything back, but because if I see anything out there, I want to be able to confirm it happened through someone else’s experience as well, so I can do this sorta thing here,  rant on and on while forgetting my original point.


Anyway, I go out there every now and then with a friend to bullshit and keep tabs on the ‘elementals’, which are ‘nature spirits’, out there, just to make sure they’re not gonna go on a rampage and fuck something up in *my* territory. I normally, when I go out there, see some things that would be labeled weird but most people. Even skeptics would say, ’That’s freaky, but this is what caused it…’ or something.


One night, I head out there with a bunch of paranormal newbies, you know, those idiots who make fun of this stuff instead of at least considering it might be true. Only three people experienced at all in this sort of thing were me, my friend, which nicknamed Siege because it you roll together ‘Cj’ that’s what if comes out as, and my brother, Rustin. There’s five or six other people out there with us. Which they jacked my Ouija board, which I’d only used once, and started messing with it while me, Siege, and Rustin were watching for anything advancing on the hill-plateau thing.


Nothing has ever actually gotten up there before, for some reason I do not know, even the things that have chased me while I was going back to my house. But we like to always make sure it’s only staying down there because we noticed it.  You know, precautionary.


Tidbit: Me and Siege always go out there with ‘battle-ready’ swords, because we’ve been attacked by physical entities while walking on the paths. Since we started doing that, nothing’s come within fifteen feet of us.


I was messing with my katana, absently running my thumb along the blade, popping it in and out of the sheath, all that, while chatting with my brother and Siege about the two creatures we saw down there.


The entire time we’re watching these things the two of my dogs that were with us were staring at the same rough places that we were. The one that is *my* dog, and not the family dogs, had his hackles up and was almost growling. I could just feel the air next to him tense, as he was on the verge of bark or growling.


Let me take a moment to explain these two things…


One was a… Vampire? But like… In spirit form, so more like a dickish spirit with vampiric tendencies. Only time I’ve ever been effected other than just emotions and sense while on that hill thing by anything. It was wearing a black-ish robe thing, which I’m not sure if it was just shadows forming that shape or an actual garb the spirit decided to ‘wear’. Anyway, it’s face was pale. Like, copy-paper white pale. I couldn’t make out any more details, as it was twenty to thirty yards away, new moon, partly cloudy, etc etc.


The other one was a huge… Like eight foot tall monstrously built humanoid. Naked, of course. &gt;.&lt; But it’ head shaped strangely, like… Maybe one of those weird alien type things people joke about, you know, elongated, oval-ish shaped skull? Except the bottom was sort of squarish. It was closer than the spirit, so I could make out more details. It was climbing through the trees, and jumping around after I found it and studied it for a few seconds. The only reasons I got this much detail out of it is because we were out there for an hour or two watchin’ this thing, and I’m rather good at using my peripheral vision, especially at night when wherever you look directly at something, it’s just black for some reason or another.


I’ll try to draw what I remember to the best of my abilities later, but for now, vague ass descriptions all you’re getting.


For a few minutes before we spotted the leecher spirit, I could really just... Feel myself getting weaker and weaker. Once I figured out the cause, I cut the link best as I could and pretty much flipped it the bird, but it went on draining from the other two there. Since we didn't have anything like salt, holy water, what have you, I had to give them a crash course in links. Siege was the only one who needed it, because he didn't have a background with it other than what I'd taught him. Rustin, on the other hand, knew how to bless areas for a short period of time, so he did that, and I showed my idiot 'pupil' how to cut links, shield yourself from 'psychic attacks', and reverse those links.


As suspected, he kind of sucked at it, and it took a few minutes for him to get it down and cut the link, but that's to be expected, because he's new at it, even more so then than now. At least he killed the link and kept it from draining him further.


In the middle of one of my sentences to Siege, about twenty minutes later, one of the people messing with the Ouija board just randomly screams and the others let out loud yelps and they all back away and drop the board, almost simultaneously. Keep in mind these five or so are the people who were joking and laughing about it. The only one that didn’t yelp is the one who lived in a haunted house for a few months. The one that screamed? Twenty year old man, engaged, three year old daughter, the works. He was acting all bravado, typical ignorant courage.


I walk over there, mildly irritated, and ask them what happened, and they stuttered out a few things, which for the life of me I can’t remember what the spirit or whatever the Hell it was said.


After I calm them down, we pack everything up, I light a cigarette, and because that white thing was jumping through the trees ahead of us and such, I unsheathed my katana, and held it out to the side, giving a stern order for *everyone* to stay behind me, even the other two who were decently experienced in this stuff. 


We’re almost to the part where we’d be safe from whatever, basically the forests ‘threshhold’. The line dividing the forest and the modern world, pretty much, and the dude that screamed just runs past me, yelling expletives,  shoving my then-dead, and still dead, brother’s fiancé and baby-mama(if you’ll forgive the idiotic slang for a moment), into my blade. Luckily the way I was holding it, it couldn’t cut her. I nearly stabbed the guy for doing something like that, though.


We got back to my house, the entire walk from the plateau to my house, I kept hearing frightened gasps from behind me whenever someone caught sight of the monstrously built humanoid dude jumping through the trees. I was keeping an eye on him out the corners of my eyes the entire time. The thing tried to follow us out of the woods, but just didn’t seem to be able to leaving the tree line. Dunno why. 


When we got to the driveway though, the guy that was acting all bravado had locked himself in his car, and the only way we could get him to come back inside was to tell him that if he stayed in his car, that thing could probably still get him, easily, which we, at the time, thought was true. Once we stopped to do that, however, my dog just took off running and barking at where the tree line was, specifically the tree the white thing was perched in. This, strangely, made it take off running, like it was afraid, or thought it couldn’t win. Very intriguing; tried researching it, but only turned up D&amp;D shit. xP


We get back inside and me and Siege just feel something watching us the whole night, as the others left after an hour or so of being back inside. I’d sit down at the computer, and feel like something was watching me through my bay window which is roughly six to seven feet off the ground. |: Needless to say, I was like, ’Dude, what?’


That continued until I was to sleep, which I had to cover my window so the face couldn’t stare at me through *it* as well, which that would be three inches from where my pillows are. No thanks. xD Had some weird dreams, woke up feeling weird, but altogether, things were back at their normal pace, just seeing shadows flock around me, trying to keep out of my direct vision, finishing peoples sentences, reacting to their movements milliseconds before they make them, etc etc. Average day. For that, after the night I had, I was pretty thankful for, if only for the simple fact that I would busted a vein in my brain trying to process the sheer amount of epic that had happened, and thus die of a stroke or something.


This bit happened roughly… Eight months ago? It was in November, last year, though I couldn’t tell you exact dates. I could tell you the exact date of my brothers death, the one I mentioned in there that was already dead at this time, but it was a week or two, give or take a day, after the funeral, so probably… The twenty eighth or something.


Another random tidbit… I have *never* seen any small animals, or any animals period besides other people or my dogs, out in these woods. Seriously weird, seeing at the mileage of just the stuff behind my house is roughly three by two or something. Heard birds. Heard insects. Just never. Freaking. Seen. Them. Ever.


I’ve got loads of other weird crap, as I have shadows, demons of sorts, ghosts, all that stalking me all the time, and I’ve pretty much gotten so used to it that I don’t notice it’s not normal until I read /nosleep, /x/, or this subreddit or watch a ghost movie. That means I could try, but I likely couldn’t get as many details as you guys would prefer. The only one I can think of that I could is the banshee bit, which that is for another time, friends.


I been saying that I'm quite used to malevolent spirits trying to jack my world up, but still... Some have managed to get under my skin to the point of me having to resort to some old Witch-style protection crap. Even if it doesn't actually work, it makes me feel better. xD


Debunking welcome, if you can manage to show me how it wasn’t paranormal that eight people and two dogs saw the exact same things. If you can, I’ll give you a hundred dollars. Well, if it’s actually scientifically tested and proven, anyway.

(just a little fun fact before beginning)

this happened when i was 14 (im 19 now) but i remember it clearly, as if it was just last night. the way my house is layed out, we have 3 stories, an upstairs which consists of 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms (one of whish is in the hall way adjacent to a guest bedroom, further down the hall is my parents room (master bedroom with a bathroom in it) and across the hall is my bedroom, on the middle floor (which is only 4 stairs down from the upstairs..i dont understand why it doesnt count as part of the upper floor) theres the garage, kitchen, dining room and living room. the kitchen has a staircase leading towards the bottom floor of the house (not counting the crawl space under the house) contains the t.v.s couches, computers and a closet, and bathroom, the closet has a fairly large hole in it leading to the crawlspace..

well, i had fallen asleep on a couch downstairs, my parents had turned off all the electronics and lights, leaving it pitch black (to conserve electricty) and i had woken at 11:50, and sat up, i had to let my eyes adjust to the darkness, as i looked across from me, there sat an old women. (i know..cliche as it sounds)she sat in the green chair across from the couch she seemed to be reading and didnt notice that i had woken up, i rubbed my eyes and made sure i wasn't dreaming and sure enough, she was still there, turning a page in the book she held (it looked fairly thick..like a old school bible)
she had this whitish look to her...extremely pale..white hair bundled up on top of her hair, in what looked like clothes youd see from an amish community... very old.. i slowly got up... all i could think was that something didnt feel right..she didnt belong here.. and how she seemed so human...but...different..thats when things got bad, she stopped reading and i froze as she looked up at me.. my heart was pounding and i wanted to yell but i couldnt..i felt like crying right there on the spot and she put the book down...except it wasnt there anymore..i saw her set it on the table next to the chair and looked at her, i looked back and it was gone..she stood up and i did everything i could to break my stare at her..i felt frozen, but as soon as she took a step forward it seemed like all the weight had been taken away from me and i bolted towards the stairs, i didnt look back for fear that she would be there, i turned the corner and ran into my room slammng and locking the door and hiding under my covers.. i had no idea what or who she was.. but i know that scared me more than ive ever been in my entire life.. i dont know why i was frozen.. why i couldnt move or look away..or why she was there in the first place..the only other experience i've had in that house was getting up to go to the bathroom...again at 11:50 (weird.. i dont know why...) and as soon as i opened more door and stepped into the hallway i saw this orb of light..about 4 feet off the ground float from the guest bedroom through the door of the bathroom (it was shut) i immedeatly turned around shut my door again and went back to bed.. that was the last experience ive had there...and also the only two times i had woken up aat exactly the same time.. (this was two weeks after the first encounter) to this day i dont know who or what they are or what they wanted..or why me... i just know that my dad agrees as you walk down the hallway you feel as if your being watched and if your walking upstairs it feels as if something is trying to pull you back... not to harm...but like saying turn around..",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_iylen,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/iylen/my_home_experiences/,

I'm back with a few very short stories about stuff that happened during my childhood. They're more like accounts rather than actual stories, but it should be fine, nonetheless.

Background Info: I moved when I was 12. My old house was surrounded by woods and countryside. My new house is in a suburb and right next to the interstate. My grandmother died when I was a Sophomore in high school, which is kind of irrelevant, but could explain something in the third ""story.""

** Okay, first ""story"": The Mysterious Bouncy Ball.**  I don't know if anyone else had them, but when I was a kid we had a few small, blue bouncy balls at our house. We used them to play catch and that was about it. One day, at my old house (I was like 8 when this happened) I was running around in the woods. Suddenly, I see one of our blue bouncy balls fly out from behind a tree and bounce before stopping at my feet. I ran behind the tree expecting my older brother. I saw no one, and the tree was only about 20 feet from me. I would have heard and seen someone run away if they had thrown it. I was terrified and ran back into the house.

** Second ""story"": Shadow People.**  When I was younger and living at my old house in rural Tennessee, I would constantly see shadows in my peripheral vision. When I turned to look and see what, or who, was there, the shadow was gone. This happened hundreds of times at my old rural house, but it hasn't happened once at my current residence. Sometime later I read that these ""shadow people"" are the spirits of Native Americans. I don't know the validity of that statement, but it wouldn't surprise me as my house was close to a section of the Trail of Tears.

** Third ""story"": A Tap on the Shoulder.**  This ocurred at my current residence and it was a few years ago. I was maybe 16 or 17. I was sitting on my computer playing games, as usual, when I felt someone tap on my left shoulder. I turned around expecting to find one of my siblings or my mother. However, no one was there and I would have heard someone run off if they were trying to trick me. Plus, I turned around instantly. They wouldn't have had the time to run away. I tried to debunk it as a muscle spasm, but I've had muscle spasms before and this felt, distinctly, like a finger tapping my shoulder. Perhaps it was my deceased grandmother trying to get my attention. I don't know.

**Fourth, and last, ""story"": Beating on the Porch Doors.**  One night my friend Cody was sleeping at my house. We were watching YouTube or something on my computer when we heard what sounded like someone trying to break into our porch doors. Cody and I quickly grabbed makeshift weapons (I had rolled up my belt and was using it like a flail, Cody grabbed a blunt object) expecting a burglar. We darted behind the couch so we were out of sight of the porch doors and waited for what felt like an hour. It was probably only like 10 or 15 minutes. When we figured out that no one was out there, we got kind of freaked out. While we were back there, we would periodically peek over the couch to look at whoever was trying to get in. (Our porch doors have several windows in them.) We didn't see anything there.

I still cannot explain any of these experiences. The Shadow People could possibly have been my young mind playing tricks on me. The rest are completely strange to me.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_iyl6i,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/iyl6i/childhood_experiences/,

There really is no reason for her to have made any of this up, considering our family never really believed in ghosts or paranormal activity. We still don't, but definitely acknowledge that my aunt and uncle's house is definitely strange. 

My mom used to clean my aunt and uncle's house for extra cash when I was a baby because she wasn't working and was a stay at home mom. She would bring me over in my little seat and let me take a nap while she cleaned. She always felt uneasy in their bathroom because their house was long and skinny with one entrance and it was the last room; if she was all the way down the hall, she couldn't hear anyone come home from work for lunch, etc. My uncle is a huge jokester that likes scaring people or just doing stupid things, so she was always on her guard anyway making sure he didn't pull one on her. 

My cousin, aunt and uncle have all seen flashes of shadows, etc before in the house and although it weirded them out they just don't necessarily believe in paranormal stuff. They have a black lab that to this day will NOT go into their bathroom. You could try to drag him but he will fight to the death not to go in there. Weird enough, whatever. One day, my mom was cleaning the bathroom and right behind her, the bathtub faucet turned on full blast. It really scared her a lot, but she just turned it off and took a little break. She told them about it the next time she saw them, and they all agreed it was definitely creepy. 

Fast forward a year or so and my aunt and uncle are out and about and they see the nice older lady that they bought the house from a few years before. She asks how everything is going with it and they say they love it. My uncle throws out something about how every month or so, someone gets a spooky moment and asked if she too had ever seen anything back when she lived there. She kind of looked a little alarmed and told them that she moved because her husband died and she no longer could afford payments on her own. He drowned in the big jacuzzi bathtub after being knock-out drunk one night. She sold pretty soon after that, so she never really saw much.

They still see stuff sometimes, but say if it is anything, it is friendly and really just don't pay any attention when it happens. F that. I don't care it its the ghost equivalent of Richard Simmons, I would be out of that house.

At the time, I didn't know that the hotel was haunted, and that the Inn advertises their ghost as a perk of staying there. Their ghost is named ""Hank"". 

My parents and 1 year old brother slept in the bedroom of our suite, and I slept in the living room on a pull-out bed. I remember feeling uncomfortable in the hotel room, and I stayed up late watching TV to keep distracted from feeling the heebie-jeebies. 

When my eyelids felt heavy enough, I turned the TV off. For the next half hour, a persistent *pop* sound, like someone clapping, came from different spots in the suite. It would come once from the end of the hall closest to my parents' bedroom, a minute later from halfway down the hall, a few seconds later from directly in front of my bed, and so forth. It sounded like a person was walking through the suite and pausing to clap, once, every minute or so. 

At first I blamed it on the AC ductwork, but the moving source of the noise was explicit, the sound was clearly the pop of a hand clap, and my proverbial hackles had been up since we got there.

I didn't know him very well, but I guess I would have called him my friend. I knew that his dad was very sick, but had no idea just how sick. He never really talked about his dad, and I never met his dad before.

Well, one night, I had a dream that I saw his dad as an angel. I am using the term angel loosely here. He looked very peaceful. Somehow I knew it was his dad. He did not have wings or anything, but I knew he was a spirit in the dream, perhaps in a different realm. I woke up my boyfriend and told him I had a strange dream of an angel, but he didn't really ask me any questions. Still, I couldn't really get it off my mind.

Well the following morning, I found out John's dad had passed away the same night I had the dream. 

Now, death is a very sensitive issue (of course), so I waited to bring up the dream I had until I knew John was ready and willing to talk about it.

Before asking any questions about his dad, I decided to describe how his dad looked in my dream. He looked pretty freaked out because my description was almost perfect. Remember, I have never seen his dad.

I then told him the dream. Now John and his family are Jehovah's Witnesses, so they don't believe in a soul that goes on after death. He really didn't know what to say.

Personally, I felt like the dad came to let me know he was at peace, and maybe wanted me to share that with John, especially because John and his family do not think of death that way. I find it strange though that if this really was a visitation from a spirit in my dream that he chose me to come to, especially because I did not know him.

Well, I thought I'd share another one of my paranormal experiences and would love to hear your thoughts!

This building has been a hotel, a dance studio, several different specialty stores, and finally an apartment building. I have found next to no explanations for anything that has occurred in the past two years, nor do I think I ever will. Enjoy.**

My first experience was the worst. It was probably four months after my fiance and I moved in, and nothing interesting had happened thus far.
I was laying in bed, winding down for the night, petting one of my cats. Just before I fell asleep, I heard my fiance's closet door nob rattle (We have separate closets here). Obviously scared out of my wits, I froze, and latched onto my cat.

*click*

The door opened. No lie, the latch made the little click noise it always did, and I heard the door push across the carpet. I clung tighter to the cat, who responded by shooting out of my arms, down the hallway, and into the living room, presumably to hide under the couch and let me deal with this entity on my own, the little bitch.
As soon as the cat left, I sensed the most incredibly evil presence I have ever felt. To this day, nothing comes close to the terror I experienced when that door opened seemingly by itself. It felt as though I was being pulled toward the closet by my head and feet, bowing my body. Somehow I broke free of my fear-paralysis, and started to vault off of my bed. Just as I thought I was free and clear, the energy reversed, and I was sent flying into my closet, ankles dragging across the bed, on the opposite side of the room from his closet.

I woke up on the moment of impact.

His closet door was open.

Needless to say, after I gathered the courage get out of bed, I spent the night in the living room, with every light in the house on. My fiance works the night shift, and was confused, to say the least, since I am the cheap-ass in our relationship and am usually avid about wasting things, including electricity. After a tearful explanation, he smudged our apartment with white sage (we both are Pagan and practice Wicca), and left the branch of sage in the closet, in the hopes that it would prevent whatever the presence was from returning. I feel like I need to clarify here, even though I have frequent nightmares, I can always tell (upon waking, at least) that it was a nightmare. If I hadn't ""woken up"" in bed, I would have taken this as something that happened to me while I was fully conscious. I believe that it was a spiritual attack. Why, I have no idea.

While I haven't dealt with what I dubbed the ""Closet Demon"" again, we had other minor, but still creepy encounters while in this apartment. Curiously, the majority of the ""pranks"" were directed at me. Possibly because even though I love horror, and am obsessed with anything paranormal, I scare fairly easily when it's happening to me. This is the reason I can't play survival-horror video games.

The pranks started with the washer lid being opened in the middle of the cycle. Always before the water drained. First, I thought it was either me forgetting the close the lid, since I am the most forgetful person on earth, or I thought maybe even the cats were playing with it and opening the lid. Every time after I found it open, I would find sopping wet articles of clothing strewn throughout the kitchen floor. This is what gave me the idea it was the cats, as I certainly didn't throw my wet socks down there. It was never more than a handful of items, just enough to make me say, ""What the fuck."" This happened three or four more times, and I eventually ruled out both myself, and the cats. Myself, by continuously checking the make sure the lid was closed after I started the wash, and the cats by realizing that one: they hate the washing machine, it scares them every time it's on, and two: there was nowhere for them to stand while lifting up the lid. It was physically impossible, especially for my clumsy pair that have a habit of falling into bathtubs and making hilarious fails trying to jump from the couch to the recliner.
It was easy to ignore the washer thing, it was just some playful little spirit, no big deal. It stopped after happening only a handful of times. Next, two things began happening simultaneously. I would get home from work, turn off all the lights, and go to bed. When I woke up in the morning, the living room light would be on. Whatever, I forgot, once again, I forget EVERYTHING. Even as I was dismissing this as my forgetful nature, I would wake up in the middle of the night, to my name being whispered right in front of my face. Not like it was on top of me, I sleep on my side and face the edge of the bed, so it was more like ""it"" was standing right in front of me. Just, ""Kitty_Crisp!"" An urgent whisper, enough to wake me up, then nothing.
One night I was laying in bed and reading, when I heard the whisper again. This was the first time I had heard it while awake, and it was terrifying, to say the least. Up until now I had been dismissing it as my crazy dreams/imagination. As I'm looking around for the source of the sound, I heard a click from the living room, like a light switch being turned on. With the way our room was set up at the time, and the layout of that apartment, if you stood at the foot of the bed you could see down the hallway, past the bathroom and laundry room, through the kitchen, and into the living room. I mustered up my not-so-famous courage, and leaned on the foot of the bed. Sure enough, the light in the living room was on. Again. It took a brief second for me to decide I wasn't going anywhere near that room until daylight, and I slept fitfully that night, woken up by three different whispers and what sounded like the living room light clicking on and off.

Another explanation to Mr. Kitty_Crisp, and he smudged the apartment once again, this time after he was done I drew salt lines on the threshold of the door and windows. Problem solved?

Since then we have only had minor problems, things going missing, uneasy feelings, etc. that could all easily by chalked up to misplacing things, paranoia, over-active imaginations, what have you. But we are moving to the next town over in a little less than a week, and let me tell you, I will never step foot back in this building again.

In our townhouse, my sister, my cousin, and I would see these shadow people, seemingly children, peering from around the corners. They didn't seem malicious and seemed to want to be around us. It was to the point where we didn't actually fear them at all, we accepted their existence.

They didn't show up only at night, they would appear on well lit walls, darkly lit walls. And just be there. Peering around the corner, and then moving back to the wall, as if they lived there.

My sister claims they giggled but I do not recall that, and the more rational adult in me wants to claim she made that up but being that we both heard ""What's up Tris!?!"" it's weird dismissing her claims.

A big source of potentially paranormal experiences happened in a farmhouse my parents bought.

When I was in late middle/early high school, my family moved to a fixer-upper farmhouse on an isolated road we shared with a few other families. The house had seen better days, and the previous owners even had something like 25 horses on a tiny 4 acre plot of land (that's nowhere near enough). Their 4 dogs lived in stacked crates...that kind of thing. I mention this because it might have to do with the energy in the house after we bought it.

On one of the first nights in the house, my younger brother left his gameboy in his room while we ate dinner. He loved that thing and cherished it like it was made of gold. But after we all go back upstairs, he comes tearing downstairs in tears. There are massive cracks through the screen, as if it fell off of something or was hit. But since he had only a mattress in his room and was so careful with it, no one really believed he broke it. 

When Mom &amp; Dad got us moved in, they decided to renovate. They added an addition and moved the front door. New addition to the basement, new first floor living room, bay window. Gorgeous. The downside is that's about when I started noticing things. 

For starters, the house just felt... busy. I never felt alone, even when I was the only one home. It wasn't really a ""watched"" feeling, just that sensation you get when someone else is in the room with you. I would walk down the stairs and just get the sense that someone else was near. That sort of thing. 

One day while home alone, I was reading on the couch in the basement. The family dog, Belle, was with me (our only pet at the time). Belle's ears perk up. I listen, and suddenly hear footsteps walk from directly above me (parents' room) through the kitchen and to the top of the stairs, where they stop.  I froze. Belle kept watching the stairs... not growling or anything, but it's clear she heard them, too. Problem was my parents and brothers weren't even close to being home yet. They didn't actually come home for another couple of hours. Suffice to say, I didn't go back upstairs until they came home.

Probably the most confusing and definitely nerve-wracking: while I was drifting off to sleep one night, I felt a pressure weigh down on my torso. Just all over, like someone laid on top of me. Freaked me right the hell out. I shot up in bed and think I stayed up reading all night with all the lights on. Nothing else happened that time.

One night a while later, I got up to use the restroom around 1 or 2am. On my way back to my room, I pass the guest room and just stop walking. I get this eerie sensation like there's something in the guest room, and I just stare at the closed door for a second. The door creaks halfway open. I book it to my room as fast as I can. 

After I told Mom about a few of these experiences, she cleansed every room with sage and told whatever was there to leave. I followed her through each room, repeating what she said and asking everything to leave... just basically saying ""this is our space and you're not welcome."" For a while, things calmed down. The house didn't seem busy. I felt comfortable there again.

Not long after, though, we had a small party with Mom's work friends one evening. Went all out and built a small bonfire in the fire pit on our back porch. I sat down to make smores or something, and my chair happened to face the house's addition. 

I was looking at the bay window, just kind of staring into space, when movement caught my eye. A small girl with long black hair and a dark dress runs around the corner of the house and into the massive tree around the other side. I froze. There were only one or two other kids coming to that party, and they were sitting around the fire with me. So the sage was either temporary or didn't work on these particular spirits.

Luckily, we moved not too long after. While the experiences were sporadic, that sensation of busyness started coming back. I drove past it once a year or two ago and couldn't help but wonder: have the new owners had any experiences? It doesn't seem right to drive up, knock, and ask, but I sure am curious.",,False,,t5_2sntx,1371337318.0,,,True,t3_1gf9s8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gf9s8/me_our_hightraffic_farmhouse/,

""You know what happened here, don't you?""

Of course I didn't, I'm not a fucking historical gold mine. I told him I had no idea and he proceeded in telling me the story.

He would bring them back to the house, take them into the basement, and cut them up on his table saw. Then, he would bury them under the crawl space. 

My friend told me that one of the girls managed to escape and hide in the attic. Now my friend's house is just absolutely massive, and for some reason it has a double attic above the regular attic. The door to the double attic is very large and heavy. So, when the girl attempted to run up into the attic and hide, she accidentally locked herself in the double attic. 

At this point I was questioning my friend's story very much, until he took me into the attic and showed me the hand prints. Little hand prints, the size of a small child, littering every wall. I was horrified. 

The carpenter had apparently let her stay up there because he knew she would starve anyways, which is exactly what happened. She starved and died in the attic. 

My friend then told me that about 6 years ago things were getting really bad at the house and they had a team of paranormal investigators come in. I couldn't believe what I saw on that video. When they entered the double attic, they did a quick sweep, and I swear to you all, in the corner of the attic, there was a little girl curled up into a ball staring at the camera. The cameraman screamed and ran down into the regular attic slamming the second door above him. I was scared shitless.

Here's where my experiences come in. It was a couple months later, and we were at ""Yako's"" house in his room watching TV. It was the middle of the day and everyone in his house was out shopping. I looked at him to ask him something when I heard it, the most blood curdling scream I have ever heard in my life. That kind of scream where you know harm is being done to someone. The kind of scream that will temporarily stop the blood from flowing through your body. He suggested we go outside for a skate sesh, and I agreed before he even finished the suggestion.

Later on that night we were in his room again watching TV getting ready to pass out. He's kind of a hippy type guy and he had beads hanging from his closet doorway, they began to swing, and all the windows were closed and there were no fans on. This didn't scare me that much, but what happened next did.

We heard three sharp taps on his window. Being the macho guy my friend tries to be, he stepped up to the window and looked out. I have never seen such a look of fear on anyone else's face. He stumbled back and almost tripped and fell onto his floor. He looked at me, completely scared shitless, shaking with the cracking voice and all. He told me there was someone in his yard watching him. When we both went to peer out of the window again, whatever was in his yard charged the window. We both screamed, closed the blinds, and ran into his living room. We could hear scratching noises from his room like someone was trying to get in. We slept in his grandmas room that night. 

The next morning we went outside for a cigarette, and I almost started crying. There, in the middle of his yard, was his screen from the window.  It was torn into pieces and there were scratches on his window. 

Needless to say that was the last time I ever slept in that house.",,False,,t5_2sntx,1370546893.0,,,True,t3_1fstbp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1fstbp/me_fr_sadistic_carpenter/,

My sisters were in the bathroom across the hall doing their hair and putting on makeup. Being the bored probably 12 or so year old boy that I was, I was making all sorts of stupid noises when all of a sudden I hear this voice say ""Shut up!"" I asked my sisters if they had said that and they were all noticeably confused, but it didn't even sound as if it came from them. It sounded as if it came from the other side of the room. This story isn't particularly creepy, but my family has a few others that I can think of.

Story: My mother grew up in a very small town and my grandfather passed away probably ten years before I was born leaving just my grandmother alone in this country house.  Whenever we would visit my grandmother I would hear her muttering to herself while she sat in the living room, but I just assumed she was praying as she was a very religious woman. I found out from my mother after she passed when I was 13, that she was actually speaking to my grandpa. Every day for over 20 years. I don't know if she ever saw him or knew that he was there, or if she just missed him that much that she talked to him because it made her feel less alone out there by herself. One night though my older sister was sleeping on the pull-out couch in the living room and awoke in the middle of the night to a bright white male figure standing in between the foot of her bed and the window. My mom believes it was her father.

Final Story: My sister was a single mother and moved into a house with my nephew who was around 3 or 4 at the time and a friend of hers who had a young daughter a year or so older than my nephew. Strange things seemed to happen in the house, radios and computers turning off and on at random or switching channels, footsteps in the middle of the night leading down the hallway to a pile of boxes and promptly knocking the boxes over, things of that nature. Where it gets pretty creepy is that my nephew began talking about something he called ""Cheeto"". He would always talk about Cheeto and would get really weird when we tried to ask him questions about it. One day he finally told us that Cheeto lives under mommy's bed (in the basement bedroom) and tries to play with him and bring him to ""the hole"". We never did figure out what that meant and my nephew would not sleep downstairs alone, but eventually stopped talking about it as he got older.

To understand the stories,  feel it is important to share some background on my family and the location of this trailer park. The trailer park, as I said in my other post was  just off of I-70 in MO, about 30 minutes east of Kansas City. Another important landmark is Lexington, MO is about 30-45 minutes from there. Now as for my family, my mom believes in the paranormal, and I do, too. My dad refuses to believe it, and up until recently, my brother did not believe, either. I will move on to my experiences now. My sister believes in the paranormal as well.

We had gotten a neighbor in the lot immediately next to ours and my dad was friends with the couple that lived there. One day, they come over and ask if everything is alright. My dad asks them what they mean and assure them that we are fine. The neighbor then goes on to tell my dad that during the night, they heard somebody running up and down the hallway shrieking and beating on the wall around 2:30am. Nobody in our house was awake at that time, and we all talked about it, but none of us had heard it. 

Another experience I had was one with a spirit I call ""the Blue Lady"". At the end of the trailer closest to our driveway was my bedroom, and my bed was on one side of the room, and hers was on the other side. When opening the door, the light from the hallway would go towards my bed. Except that on this night, it didn't. It was almost as if a black wall had engulfed that part of the room. I didn't feel safe going over there. so I slept on my sister's bed. I can't say how long I had been asleep, but I can say that I was woken up by something.

A hand was resting right where my collar bones meet my sternum and somebody was gently shaking me awake. I open my eyes and freeze. There was a girl in the bed, leaning over me and staring at me. She was wearing a nightgown and had short, wavy hair. After I realized that she was not just a dream (the pressure she was exerting on my chest was increasing) I noticed that she was blue. Everything about her was blue. She had monochrome color across the entirety of her being, and she was just staring at me, leaning closer. At some point during this encounter, I passed out. I awoke the next morning and asked my sister if she had seen the blue lady, and she sneered and said no.

Another happening at the trailer was the hallway. It sounds trivial, but each person in my family all agree that they did not want to stand in front of that hallway at night. My mother even remarked about how unless the lightbulb in the hall was on, the light just seemed to stop, like hitting a wall. 

Many of my experiences happened on the phone with my best friend, Corey. One that we both experienced together was while I was in my bedroom, talking on the phone with her. I was sitting on the bottom bunk of me and my sister's new bed since I didn't want to climb all the way up to mine. The phone was on speakerphone so I didn't have to hold it for the many hours we would inevitably talking. I got up to go get a snack and told Corey to wait. She said ""Alright --"" and I can't recall what she said afterwards because a low growl came from the phone.

I turned and asked her why she growled, and she sounded very confused and said ""I thought that was you."" 

I can post more of my experiences later, if anybody would like to hear them, but I am going to leave you with these for now. Any help on what the spirits could have been would be nice.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1ct5lj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1ct5lj/my_experiences_in_the_trailer_mefamfr/,

Hey everyone, sorry for the delay, I've been rather busy.  I'm going to share a few stories of when I was living at my aunt's house.  I believe these stories are related to the one I originally posted.  For a clearer understanding of the stories, here's a [--&gt;map&lt;--](http://i.imgur.com/ROMHxgG.png) of the house.


**The First Time I Saw Her**

At this time I was in my first year of art school.  I was never home that often because I was schooling full time and working part time, and on my spare time would stay at school and do my projects.  So the only real time I was ever at home was either really late at night when everyone was already sleeping or on the weekends.


One particular evening I was doing homework in the living room with the TV on, facing my aunt's room.  My two cousins that lived there were out with their friends that night and my aunt Vanessa had left a few hours prior to me buckling down in the living room.  Those people (including myself) were the only ones that lived in the house.


I was hunched over drawing on the floor when I started getting a very uneasy feeling that I was being watched or there was another person nearby.  I tried to play it off as if the stress of trying to finish my drawing coupled with lack of sleep was making me delirious.  However, the more I ignored this unsettling sensation the worse it got.  I decided I would close Vanessa's bedroom door because the dark room was not helping my mood.

Just as I'm about to get up and close Vanessa's door I see a woman/girl with long black hair and a white gown or set of pajamas walk from the left side of the room all the way to the right, into the bathroom of the bedroom.  I didn't know what to think at first, I had a hard time registering what I had just seen.  Obviously it was impossible for anyone to be in the house without me knowing, but I know what I saw.


It took me forever to muster up the strength to close the door.  I turned the TV up louder and continued drawing, hoping to forget what had just happened.  I decided not to tell anyone because I didn't want to freak them out, but one of my cousins would later tell me of multiple incidents where she saw a female in white with long black hair.


**The Second Time: Closing the Gap**

The second sighting of this female, whom we soon began to call April, occurred while both my cousins Kaylyn and Tiffanie were home.  Kaylyn was in the living room watching TV, Tiffanie was in her mom Vanessa's room.  I was in the kitchen washing the dishes before prepping dinner while asking them what they wanted to eat.  I was yelling out options and getting responses from both of them.


I picked up the last dish and started scrubbing it.

""How does salmon sound?"" I asked as I focused on my task. 

From the living room, Kaylyn called out ""Yeah, that's good!""

I just started to turn my head over to my left to yell louder and ask Tiffanie since I had not heard a response from her yet, when I get this huuuuge rush of cold air on my left side.  My line of vision had not even reached the staircase yet when out of my peripherals I see a female in white with long black hair coming right next to my face.  It happened so fast it nearly took all the air out of my lungs.  She came up right next to my face, her head facing forward toward the bathroom.  I could only see her profile for a brief split second, cheekbones, a chin, flat nose.  Almost as quickly as she came, she turns to her left and walks up the staircase at an unnatural speed.

All I could do after that was loudly say ""What the FUCK?!"" in a shaken voice.   I knew that was not Tiffanie, but I asked Kaylyn if that was her that had just passed anyway.  Of course Kaylyn said no.  I then went to my aunt Vanessa's room to see Tiffanie sitting on her bed calmly reading a magazine.  I had just been mind fucked.


I was visibly disturbed and they kept pressing to tell me what just happened, so I caved and told them.  Then I told them about the first incident.  After that things never really calmed down and Kaylyn would tell me stories of her encounters with April.



Thanks for reading guys!  I tell these stories every once in a while, but actually typing it all out really brought me back.....still getting the creeps right now.  Hope you enjoy it, would love to hear some feedback!

From August 2010 until May 2012 I worked as a security intern at a local hospital. I was only 16 when I began and I thought it was the coolest job ever. And it was a very interesting job. Being security I had access to every room in the hospital. I typically worked second and third shifts, which were 3p-11p and 11p-7a. During the shift we would have to do Detex, which were basically security checks of the entire hospital. Being the low man on the totem pole, I usually got stuck with this job. But I didn't mind it because it was usually just an hour of walking and I got to snoop around. When I worked days I never had any problems. I would hum to myself and talk to staff. However, third shift was another story. I would hear and see things especially in the cancer center. It would also feel like I was being watched. 

Possibly the scariest experience I had happened in summer 2011. I was working third shift and I had been dispatching all night, so about 3 I got a break. I'd go smoke and then just walk for a little bit to wake myself up. So after I finished my cigarette I decided to walk around the cancer center because they had a fridge with soda that we could take. I walked in to the main hallway and past the chemo section. As soon as I passed the beds an alarm started going off. There are no patients held over night and all beds get unplugged by staff, so there was no reason that the alarm should have gone off. I booked my ass out of there immediately. And I swore I heard a female laugh as the door shut behind me.

1364256638.0,13,self.Thetruthishere,1b0bxg,"[ME/FR] Unsurprisingly, creepy things happen in old hospitals",wkinder,14,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1b0bxg/mefr_unsurprisingly_creepy_things_happen_in_old/,"Okay, so I've always been...susceptible to the idea of ghosts being real.  Ghost stories have always been the only scary thing that actually frightened me although I still seek them out (obviously...), but until I was about 20 I had never had an experience myself and so still maintained a little skepticism about paranormal stuff, even though it was fun to think about.  This post is about when I finally experienced something that convinced me.  It's kind of long and a three-parter--one experience that was mine, and two experiences that my co-workers had.

I went to college at a university that was founded in the 1890s and has a major hospital that was built in 1927 (and added to since then).  For a couple of years, I was a tech in the sleep research lab there.  The research lab was in the oldest part of the hospital, which was kind of shabby compared to the newer wings.  As a tech, you would sometimes have to spend the night in the lab to make sure the subject got to sleep on time with all their electrodes in place and to wake them up on time in the morning.  During one of my night shifts, I put the subject to bed at 1:30, made sure the computers were recording, locked up the office, and went to one of the spare subject rooms (Room C).  The subject rooms were basically like hotel rooms that opened onto a typically hospital-like hallway.  Other than the subject in the room across the hall, I was alone--the research hall was fairly short and closed at both ends by wooden double-doors that were locked from the inside at night.  I closed the door and went to the sink in the room to splash water on my face, and while I had my head down I heard a high-pitched, feminine voice right next to my ear.  It seemed really loud, but the room was dead silent when it happened so any level of noise would have seemed loud.  I literally jumped and spun around; I remember thinking in that split second that the sleep subject, a young woman, had somehow come into my room to ask me something, but nobody was there (and the door was still closed).  I stuck my head into the hallway, but everything was quiet and the subject's door was closed.  After calming down, I brushed it off--even though I was alone in the lab hallway, it wasn't like the whole hospital was empty and I just assumed voices had traveled through the vents or something (even though there weren't any vents on that side of the room) or that maybe some really loud janitors had been walking down the hallway (even though the janitors weren't allowed to clean the lab at night so as to not wake up subjects).  Anyway, my point is that at no point did I assume it was a ghost or anything weird like that.  I think I even forgot about it by the next morning.

A couple of weeks later, I was working in the afternoon and talking to the tech who was going to have to stay overnight (I'll call him H).  This time there were two subjects and only one free room, which happened to be the one I had been staying in.  My co-worker said that he was going to pull out the cot and sleep in the office with all the computers instead and I asked why.  He said that, several weeks earlier, he had been sleeping in that room (Room C) and had a nightmare where he was in the room, floating up in the corner by the ceiling, and there were two female nurses and a little girl with long dark hair by the door.  The nurses were struggling to hold the little girl still while she was screaming and kicking.  One of the nurses stuck a large needle in the girl's arm and the girl looked straight at H and screamed at him for help.  Then he woke up.  He said that he normally doesn't remember his dreams and that it was the most vivid, horrible dream he'd ever had and he couldn't get back to sleep that night.  But hey, it was just a dream, so he didn't think much of it.  

Until the next day, when he told yet another co-worker of ours (I'll call him M...I actually can't even remember his name) about the dream.  M, usually a laid-back guy, started freaking out over H's story and said that, a few nights earlier, he had also been staying in Room C.  Before turning in, he went to a cabinet down the hall to get some extra blankets and, when he turned around to go back to Room C he saw a little boy and a little girl standing right next to the door.  After a second, they disappeared.  Of course, the little girl had long dark hair, just like the girl in H's dream.  

So when I heard from H about his and M's experiences, I remembered the voice I had heard and told him about my own experience.  I really believe that the voice I heard was the little girl trying to talk to me.  But I never went back in that room at night and rarely ventured in during the day (I always felt like I was being watched), so I never had any other experiences.  One night, I took my digital voice recorder in the room, said ""I'm leaving this here overnight so, if you have anything to say, now's your chance.""  And then I slept on the cot in the office.  But in the morning, when I went to check the recording, I discovered that the batteries had died about 10 seconds into it.  Might be a coincidence, but, since I had only used that recorder once before, it seemed a little fishy.  I never tried to do it again with fresh batteries, which I still kick myself about.  I think I just wasn't sure if I even wanted to hear anything on the recording...

To top off the whole thing? (And this is going to sound fake, but I swear this is all true.)  The sleep research hallway used to be the location of the hospital's child psychiatry ward, which got moved to a nearby wing when a building addition was added in the 60s/70s.  

[And for the record, despite my predilection for wanting to believe in ghosts, up to that point I had not been even slightly nervous about being in an old hospital at night.  I spent most of my daytime hours there working various jobs, so it had long before lost any inherent creepiness for me.  I used to regularly wander around the empty basement hallways of the hospital after midnight on those late shifts, hitting up the vending machines...good times.]",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1b0bxg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1b0bxg/mefr_unsurprisingly_creepy_things_happen_in_old/,

I had been hardcore crashdieting to lose weight. My Aunt (who is also my boss) knew about my diet but she did not know how sick I had gotten, as she mostly only sees me at work. I was going days without eating, partly because I was dieting and partly because I had gotten so sick that I was not holding down food anyway. I thought I had the stomach flu. Monday I went to work and was sickish but not more than was usual for me lately. I was having dizzy spells when I stood up and generally feeling sick to my stomach constantly. Tuesday was my day off work and I spent it in bed. I didn't eat, but I didn't throw up at all either. I did have a fever and body aches though. Wednesday I got up and got ready for work and was throwing up violently from the moment I awoke. I went to work anyway, as I am a single mom and bills don't pay themselves. Wednesday I was throwing up at least twice an hour from the moment I woke up. My aunt knew I was ill, but she thought it was due to my diet or due to maybe a virus. I stayed at work my whole 10 hour shift. My aunt did not know I was now so sick at this point that I was not eating at all, but throwing up stomach bile.Thursday I called in sick to work and stayed in bed again. If I stood up, I threw up. I thought I had the flu, due to my Tuesday symptoms of fever and body aches. Friday I got up and got ready for work. I was still throwing up and by now looked horrible and my eyes were bloodshot from constantly throwing up. I showered, did my best to look presentable, and went to work. I got there late because I had thrown up again right before I left for work, and had to shower again and change clothes.

I got to work, clocked in, and passed by my aunt who was already looking for me. She stopped me and asked how I was feeling. Then she got a good look at me and said ""Whoa, you don;t need to be here. You are going to pass out. Also, I had the worst nightmare about you last night that you were seriously ill and in the hospital."" She sent me home. 

Due to her dream, to make her feel better, I drove to the ER. I was tired and tired of vomiting and figured they would tell me it was a virus, give me some nausea medicine, send me home to rest. I was wrong. They took a urine sample and said my liver enzymes were elevated. Then they did an ultrasound to look at my pancreas and gallbladder to see if one of those was the reason. I think they took blood already at this point too. Then, I was admitted. My potassium levels (supposed to be in the 3's the nurse said), were in the 1's. I was told I had gallstones and was being scheduled for emergency gallbladder removal surgery the next morning at 8am (they had to stabilize me first, rehydrate me and get my potassium levels back up to normal). The next morning I had my gallbladder removed. My aunt was there in the hospital with me. The doctor told her that my gallstones were so bad that they had completely blocked my bile passages, and that is the reason I was throwing up so much. Had I not gone to the ER that Friday, I would have been in by ambulance soon after in a more emergency situation.

Tldr: My aunt knew I was sick but did not know the extent of how sick I really was because I kept that business to myself. She had a terrible nightmare that I was seriously ill and ended up in the hospital. Got sent home from work the day after she had that dream so I went to the ER to hopefully get some nausea medicine, and it turns out I really was seriously ill after all and needed emergency gallbladder removal.

She is not the type of person to lie, make things up, be intoxicated, or otherwise. At the time of the incident I was too young to be 'involved' with it, it generally stayed between my mother and father. Once a night, or every other night, my mother would wake up to the sound of footsteps on the roof above her room. My father is a very heavy sleeper like myself, and the noise would never wake him up. The footsteps would always start at her bedrooms end of the house (which was at the edge of the house), running across the roof over the hallway, family room, kitchen, the it would just fade off as if it got more distance and the person or thing could just keep running off the roof right on thin air. This happened for several years and was very consistent. It always freaked my mother out to the point where she would quite often wake my father up (he would hear the noises then) and he would jump up on the roof and look for any people or animals, but the footsteps would usually have faded off the other edge of the house by the time he managed to get up there. He never found or saw anything, and he generally brushed it off. My mother took it much more personal as she felt it was directed at her, and it always tended to wake her up. Right next to my mothers room, outside, was an old shed that we used to store things in. She had a very old pair of expensive shoes in there from her mother, which would seem to be totally unrelated to the roof noises, but one time when we were packing up for a vacation to California, she took the shoes out of the closet and packed them up in her luggage the night before departure. Then the next morning, the shoes were nowhere to be found, she drilled all of us, my father, brother, and me about who took/moved her shoes. Nobody had anything to say as none of us touched her shoes or had any reason to. Right before leaving she decided to check the shed again and they were still in their original spot, she took them out, packed them again, and off we went. After that the roof noises never came back and my mother swears that they were related, she could 'feel it'. Pretty freaky true story, it may mean more to me than the general public because my family nor mother are the type to make up anything, and we are all non-believers. It's just something totally strange that can't be explained.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_12d80t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/12d80t/fam_old_haunted_shoes/,

My favorite grandmother had died, and because he had nowhere else to go, my father was living with us for a time. It was an uncomfortable living situation, as my father and I are not close. Eventually, after refusing to help pay the rent, he resentfully left. It was not a tearful goodbye. My dad stood in my bedroom doorway, holding out my grandmother's dentures to me, and said something to the tune of: ""Well, bye.""

(Note: I collect bones, hair, and dentures, so I had begged my dad to let me have my grandmother's dentures. He thought my bone and teeth and hair collection was creepy, and refused to give me the dentures. I guess him offering them to me when he left was as much of a peace offering as he could make.)

This was about two years ago, and I was easily more devastated by the loss of my grandmother than I was by my father leaving. I missed her terribly- her goodness, her wisdom, her optimism. My dad had brought all kinds of her posessions with him when he came to live with us, so I had keepsakes and mementos from her, including one of those pretend toddler cloth peek-a-boo dolls that stand up by themselves in the corner with their faces covered. The doll was a bit creepy so I kept it in my closet, out of the way, but I didn't want to get rid of it because when she had been alive she had said that it reminded her of me when I was little, and I'm a pretty sentimental person, so I held on to it.

In my greif, I wanted nothing more than to talk to my grandmother again, so I decided to do a ritual. I took some of her hair and her dentures and attempted to summon her spirit. Because the dentures helped her speak in life, I thought maybe I could use them as a link to encourage her to speak in death. 

So I did my ritual, but didn't see instantaneous results. I wasn't troubled that nothing readily apparent had happened, I didn't think too much of the fact and I honestly hadn't expected a booming voice from nowhere, so I just accepted that I had failed and moved on and didn't think much of it again for a few days, until unusual things started happening. Nothing frightening at all, but curious. 

Things that I had set down would wind up in other places, like jewelry or keys. I still wasn't super concerned, but I was a little bit excited because I thought it might have been my Nanny. 

One night I came home from work one night to find her cloth peek-a-boo doll propped up in the corner of my bedroom! How did it get out of my closet? That sent chills all through me. Finally, a sign of direct communication! I left it out overnight, and then I put it back in to the closet because there wasn't a lot of room for it and I wasn't super into the idea of having it hang out in my room all the time. At this point I was pretty sure that my ritual had worked.
 
The doll was moved several more times out of my closet and into my bedroom over the course of a month, but after awhile I got tired of always having my stuff moved around and released the spirit from my calling it without ever achieving any kind of meaningful or coherent communication. 

Was it really my Nanny? I can't say. It might have just been a playful spirit picking up on my desire for more contact with my grandmother, but someone or some thing had anwered my call and was moving things about in my bedroom. After I did the release ritual the uncanny things stopped. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_zflfo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/zflfo/me_communication_with_a_spirit/,

My mom filed bankruptcy on the house and we packed up our things.  My brother decided to stay with my father and I went with my mother.  That summer my dad took my brother and I to Sea World before dropping me off at my new home that my mother was busy making ready.  And so I began my new life in Tivoli Texas.  


It's a really small town.  Driving down I-35 you can drive through it in a blink of an eye.  The town didn't have that much going for it.  A Dairy Queen, antique store, school, bar, gas station, and a motel.  The town consisted of mainly Mexicans and some white folk.  Through some way or another I was related to half of the town as well.  Our junior high and high school were in the same building with one major hallway.  That is how small it was.


Due to the fact that my mother was Mexican and my father white I wasn't Mexican enough or white enough for the town.  Thus I encountered racism for the first time in my life.  And thus began a chain of depression and failing grades.  It wasn't until I failed my freshman year of high school that my mother decided to send me to a different school.  And so I began school in Port Lavaca home of the fighting Sandcrabs.


It was another small school.  By small I mean kids from Magnolia Beach, Port Lavaca, Port Comfort, Port O'Conner, Seadrift, and Tivoli all made up the high school population.  But it was here that I finally met people who didn't judge me based on the color of my skin but on my personality.  And quickly I made friends.  It was during this time that my brother moved back in with my mom and I after things didn't work out at my dad's.


When I was about 16 and going on 17 I met my now ex boyfriend through a random chat room on AOL.  He knew about the tiny town of Tivoli due to the fact that his school and the Tivoli school competed in sports, UIL activities, etc.  So we began a long distance relationship since he lived about 3 hours away.  I finally got to meet him during my 17th birthday party.  My brother was there, mom of course, my friend who we will call Meg, and my other friend who we will call Joe.


We were having a great time just chilling at the house, playing video games, and drinking malt liqour courtesy of my brother.  It wasn't until sometime later when all of us were outside in my background smoking cigarettes that my ex asked about the silos.


Now these silos were across the street from my aunt's house.  When my friend who we will call Regina came to stay at my house she asked if there was anything spooky with them.  Because honestly they did look pretty spooky.  They stood tall and ominous with rust spots here and there.  Overgrown grass to hide them partly from view.  When I had asked my mother and other relatives about it they never told me the history but they were adamant that I stay away due to coyotes or whatever else may be living in them.  I always thought it was strange that the history was never shared with me.


I of course told this information to my ex and friends that were with him.  Slightly intoxicated in the humidity we all decided it would be a great idea to go and investigate.  So, armed with our bottles of malt liqour and cigarettes we headed that way.  It wasn't a long walk maybe a couple of minutes before we got there.  It was dark and we couldn't see anything.  So we had to go back and get my ex's car to shine the headlights so we could see.


I didn't get very far because unlike my friends I was wearing sandals and ended up stepping in an ant hill.  So after I had gotten the angry buggers off of me I watched my friends begin their exploration while I waited in my ex's car.  I was smoking a cigarette and listening to the radio when after about 10 minutes they all came running out.  Quickly they piled into the car and we went back to my house.


After calming down they reported seeing shadows of people and red eyes as well as whispering voices.   Thinking it was the alcohol I brushed it off.  The rest of the weekend went fine and life returned to normal.  After those events I really didn't think much of the silos as I concentrated on school.  That was until about a year later when my friend Regina stayed with me.


My friend Regina has always held an avid interest in anything paranormal.  And the silos were no different.  One weekend she was staying at my house and wanted to investigate.  My cousin (who we will call Brady) and my neighbor (who we will call Mike) was interested as well.  So they came over to my house when I told them of our plans to investigate.  Her boyfriend (who we will call Mark) decided to come along as well.  This happened around October if I remember correctly.  It was also my first time inside of the silos.  We waited until my mother and brother were asleep before walking that way.  We came prepared with flashlights, our cell phones, and a camera ready to record anything.


Upon walking in there during the night with very little light save for the faint glow of flashlights I felt...Uneasy.  However we pressed on looking around.  There was a metal grate under us which did not prove interesting as the ground below it there was nothing but trash.  I noticed some feathers laying around in which I remembered something about my mother stating that the La Chusa lived there.  If you're not familiar it's a creature that's part owl and part woman.  Or a witch that turns into a owl with human features.  However, I simply thought that barn owls lived there.  


After looking around the outside for a while we decided to go into one of the silos as the wind was picking up and it was getting a bit chilly.  Shining our lights around we found a noose made of metal wire.  We also did find my cousin's name Brady written inside of the silo.  It was a little creepy.  I felt the hairs stand up on the back of my neck and heard whispering in my ear.  Though thinking it might have been the fact we were inside a cylindrical object made of metal it might have been the echoes.  It wasn't until I felt an invisible force grab me and pull me towards the middle of the room where the noose was that we started to freak out.  It also didn't help that we heard a woman crying and singing mournfully.  We didn't wait to see what would happen next as we ran out and back to my house.  Since we were too freaked out we didn't manage to capture anything with the camera or our cell phones.


Once those events happened we didn't go back to the silos.  And it was soon forgotten in my mind.  That was until about a month or so later my cousin Brady told me that my neighbor Mike and him had gone there late at night.  They were too afraid to tell me what had happened.  I do remember my cousin Brady telling me that my neighbor Mike had fainted suddenly and my cousin had dragged him back to his house.  It was there that Brady's mom did performed a La Limpia.  Which is a Mexican egg cleansing ritual on Mike.  Brady told me when his mom cracked the egg it was bloody before she flushed it.


It wasn't long after that the silos were torn down.  I wonder what history there is behind those silos or the land...",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_x9x0e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/x9x0e/mefr_the_silos_xpost_from_rnosleep/,

So I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Anyway let me just give you some background. Sweet Hollow Road is a haunted road in New York. One of the many stories is that a group of children went to a bridge on sweet hollow road and hung themselves. So its said if you put your car in neutral under the bridge the children will push your car. Now that you know that on to the story!
        Me and my uncle woke up around 2:00am-ish to go to Sweet Hollow Road. You have to go late in the night. 1-its creepier and 2-there's too much traffic in the day. Anyway we were drive down this road, so far everything good nothing was really happening. But as we were driving I noticed that there was fog around the car. I just ignored it and thought it was because it was nighttime and there's fog. So we just continued on the road. But then all of a sudden... BOOM! There was fog everywhere! Me and my uncle were so confused and a little shaken but we continued on the road. While we were driving through the random fog I saw something run past the corner of my eye. It was black and really fast. When I turned my head to see what it was there was nothing there! I just ignored it and thought it was nothing. Thinking it was nothing I didn't bother to tell my uncle. Anyway we finally got to the bridge, we put the car in neutral, and like the stories said the car was moving forward. It was the most wonderful experience. It was so slow and peaceful, it felt like we were floating. And we WERE NOT on a slant. If it was gravity pushing us down a hill we would have gained speed. We never did gained any speed. We were pushed all the way out of the bridge and the same constant speed. Im telling you the truth. Most people say you were just on a little hill! No we weren't I promise you that. Anyway the rest of the drive home was normal nothing unusual. The next day we were bragging to my sister about the whole adventure! As me and my uncle were explaining what happened he turns to me and says ""I didn't want to tell you last night because I didn't want to scare you but I saw some black thing run past my window""! I was so surprised and then I told him the same thing happened to me but I didn't tell him because I thought it was nothing. It was the most creepiest thing that has ever happen to me. I haven't had a chance to go back to the road but I would love to! I love paranormal experiences excpecially when they happen to me!
      Well that's my Sweet Hollow Road story! All of it is true and I hope you enjoyed! Also tell me if I should put this on /r/nosleep! Sorry its short.

1338493666.0,12,self.Thetruthishere,uedar,Strange and scary event at the campsite [ME]....,Mcready,16,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/uedar/strange_and_scary_event_at_the_campsite_me/,"So, here is a slightly more scary odd event from my childhood...there are more to follow and this seems like the right place on Reddit to post this stuff...

This event happened when I was approximately six years old. To be clear I have an excellent memory and have very clear recollections of my childhood from the age of four onwards. I can remember things from before I was even at school with incredible precision and the things I describe here are burned into my mind with great clarity.

When I was a kid I spent a lot of time on a camp site in Sussex. My Grandparents (who looked after me and brought me up) used to own a caravan there and we would go almost every weekend or school holiday.

It was a pretty magical place and in stark contrast to the rest of my childhood and teens, is responsible for some really good memories of being a kid. 

The campsite that we used to go to was considered safe ground, in that everyone knew everyone and that meant that kids like me were allowed to play out well after dark as we couldn’t get lost or get into too much trouble. Our parents or guardians never had to worry about where we were, we were free to explore.

This campsite had a large lake in the middle of it and often my Grandfather would stay up late for a bit of night fishing. One particular night he and a friend were sitting by the lake fishing and I was out and about playing on my own. I stood around waiting for someone to catch a fish but quickly got bored when nothing happened so wandered away from the caravans further along the edge of the lake.

It was quite dark and there weren’t really any lights around once I had walked far enough along, but it was a completely clear night sky and there was just enough moonlight that I could see where I was going. I stopped at a tree by the edge of the lake and, for no real reason that I remember decided to walk up to it, this is where my amazing memory of my childhood falters a little bit because I can remember looking at the top of the tree and seeing something, but I don’t know what. I remember whatever it was that drew my eyes to that tree meant that I was compelled to stand on tip toes and reach up to the corner of a branch growing out of it.

Then, suddenly as I was reaching for this area of the tree, something grabbed my hand, seriously, I’m not making this up, something grabbed me and I could not move. I felt something that I can only liken to a very sudden electric shock. I remember it was even more disturbing because I couldn’t even flex my fingers, my entire hand felt numb, like it was stuck in treacle.

I could hear a noise that to this day I have trouble describing, it sounded like a kind of constant but very low pitched buzz, it was dark and as I looked up at my hand I could see nothing, I couldn’t even see my hand as everything was in the shadows, all I could observe was what looked like a frantic movement of something just above my wrist. I could make out what seemed like the tips of something dark moving about very rapidly. I tried to pull my hand free but however much I tried I could not get it free from whatever had grabbed it. I do specifically remember that sudden shock of my hand being grabbed and this weird numb feeling.

By this point, once I realised couldn’t get free I was SCREAMING for help, I mean really shouting at the top of my lungs, but nobody came, despite the fact that there were caravans and my grandfather and his fishing buddy about 15 metres away. Nobody came to help. Just as total fucking hysteria was setting in my hand finally came free and I fell backwards, looking at the tree above me I could still see nothing. The feeling had returned to my hand and I quickly ran towards the caravans to look at my arm.

When I got to some light I looked at my arm, it was slightly red, but other than that there was nothing, no marks, nothing at all. The skin felt a little bit weird, like it was hyper sensitive. I shouted over to my grandfather and asked why he hadn’t heard me but got no response, he and his buddy were just sitting there. Freaked, I ran to the nearest caravan, where I knew that my Grandmother was with the wife of my Grandfathers fishing buddy watching TV. I burst in, a total mess, really freaked out.

I remember asking my grandmother if she had heard me screaming, but weirdly she seemed to be in a complete daze, she was totally uninterested, I tried to explain but her and her friend just sat there, looking at the TV like they were in a daze. I ran out of the tent and continued to look at my hand and arm. I then ran back to the caravan and looked through the glass at my Grandmother and her friend, then back at my Grandfather completely freaked that everyone seemed to be oblivious or unresponsive to me and what had just happened. By now I was crying, and sat on the grass trying to make sense of what was happening.

About 2 minutes later and my Grandmothers friend came out and asked me what was wrong, finally everyone was back I thought! I tried to explain to her and she took me inside and looked at my arm, not understanding herself, she could see that I was seriously distressed and decided (perhaps to try to calm me down!) to wrap my arm and hand in a bandage.

I was then taken back to our caravan by my Grandmother and went straight to bed and lay down. I slept terribly, I remember twisting and turning in the night, my mind reeling with thoughts about what had happened; I went to sleep crying because the whole thing was not making sense. I woke up very late in the morning, eventually I must have drifted off into a really deep sleep and I woke up very refreshed. As I got up I looked down on my pillow and found to was COVERED in blood, streaks of it all over, I quickly ran to the mirror and found my top lip and nose caked with dried blood, it seems I had some kind of massive nosebleed during the night. Then I remembered the bandage on my arm, I took it off, scared at what I would find, only to find...nothing. No marks, no red patches, no evidence of anything, the only thing I would say is that I remember looking at the bandage very closely and seeing lots of tiny black specks, but nothing else.

The whole thing was swiftly forgotten about by everyone except me, my Grandparents weren’t exactly approachable about this kind of weirdness, so if anything I was scared to mention it again. To finish I would note that since then, every now and then I get a really intense pain in that same hand and wrist, to the point where I cant even use it to carry anything. The pain comes and goes at random, sometimes not happening for years at a time, but to this day it still happens.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_uedar,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/uedar/strange_and_scary_event_at_the_campsite_me/,

The legend goes that there was once a slave named Juju that was freed after the Civil War. He lived by himself in a secluded shack. Two sons of a wealthy plantation owner were fishing, got bored, and decided to harass Juju in his shack. A few days later the boys were found murdered and the people in the area blamed Juju, went to his shack, hauled him out and hung him from a tree by the bayou (really just a man made drainage ditch to keep the area from flooding to bad). The legend says that you can see his ghost at night sometime (i.e. hanging for the tree, walking by the bayou, in the middle of the road, etc.) It used to be just an old dirt road that was seldom used and has since been abandoned. Another black top road goes around that section of it now. 

We decided we would go to Juju road to consume a few beers and the illegal drugs we had (cannabis). We were just sitting around B.S.ing and having a good time when someone started saying they saw someone walking up the road. Of course, not wanting to get busted with alcohol and marijuana, we started piling in the car to leave (my car, a Honda Accord that had never before nor since gave me any problems). My car wouldn't start. It just turned over and over and over, but wouldn't start. My friend in the passenger seat started freaking out and pointing in the direction we saw the figure walking from (in front of us). We look up and see a ghostly figure with a rope around it's neck walking toward us. I started to kind of freak out, because my car has never failed to start. The figure kept walking toward us and we can finally tell it's not a real person. We were all kind of freaked out, when I finally got the car started. I made a u-turn and hauled ass out of there. We never went back there to party or hang out.

We aren't the only ones who have seen this apparition. There have also been reports of a group of Satan Worshipers (not satanist) in that area in the 80's that burnt one of their members alive after he refused to help them sacrifice a child.

1326655264.0,12,self.Thetruthishere,oi8i3,[FR][ME] Something in the Basement (x-post from r/nosleep),Fevered,16,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/oi8i3/frme_something_in_the_basement_xpost_from_rnosleep/,"I want to start this off by saying that I'm a very skeptical person. The older I become the more difficult it is for me to believe in the paranormal. That being said, I have one major experience that I don't think I'll ever be able to explain.

Back in the late 90s my parents had a brand new house built in the suburbs not far from Chicago. Back then we were one of the first families out here. It's crazy, you go there now and the place has completely exploded. Tons of traffic, stores everywhere, and no bare plot of land to be seen. Anyway, on the next street over there was a family who arrived before us. Growing up, these folks were like a second family to me. The family consisted of a mother, father, three sons, and a sister. One of the sons, Steve was my best friend. Steve, his brothers, and I would always find things to get into. These things consisted of catching frogs, playing video games, freeze tag, and sleepovers. A lot of wonderful memories came from this time.

Anyway, this particular event took place when I was 10 or 11 years old. It was summer at the time. This meant no school and fun times aplenty. On this day Steve and myself were hanging in his living room when we decided to go play air hockey. This wasn't anything out of ordinary since Steve had an air hockey table in his basement. At the time the basement was unfinished. It was basically a large concrete rectangle with the center intersected by the stairs. Underneath the stairs was the water heater and furnace.

Here's a lousy MS Paint mock-up of the layout: http://i.imgur.com/tFWJT.jpg

So we hit the lights and go down the stairs. Steve powers up the air hockey table and it gives its old familiar hum. We start playing and we're having a good time. Nothing seems amiss until something draws our attention towards underneath the stairs. I turned my head and seen something I'll never forget. Leaning out from behind the water heater was a very pale figure dressed entirely in black. His body was thin and his expression was blank. He just stared at us.

Steve and I quickly traded confused glances and looked back. It was gone.

Standing there for a moment Steve called out for Shane, his older brother, thinking he was playing a prank. There was nothing but silence and the hum of the table. At this point we're both on edge. Steve quickly runs over by the water heater to see if anyone's hiding. Looking quickly he finds nothing. At this point we turned everything off and booked it upstairs as fast as we could.

Talking on the first floor, our first guess was that it was Shane. He somewhat resembled the figure, but there was a few problems with that. One was that we would have heard or seen him run out from behind the objects and go up the stairs. The second was that he wasn't even home that day. Steve and I still can't come up with a good logical explanation for what we saw. As kids though it sure did scare the crap out of us. We stayed away from the basement for a long time afterwards.

I have no idea how true this is, but sometime later I heard a story about a car crash years before in the area by the house. In it were several teenagers all dressed in black going to a concert (probably Korn or something). Apparently, they all perished and some were thrown quite far from the vehicle.

Here's a quick story that also happened to me:

A few years ago my friend Matt and I decided to try out a Ouija board. I didn't believe they worked, but I figured it'd be fun to try it once. I ended up making the board myself using a piece of cardboard and permanent marker. We used a shot glass for the planchette.

So the night comes and we're both sitting in Matt's room. Matt goes around the house and makes sure to shut off all the lights (nobody else was home). We light some candles in the room and begin asking questions. Mostly stuff about future current events and politics. We get some answers, but I wasn't really buying it. Nothing too weird or scary happens and we finish thirty minutes later. We open the door to Matt's room and low and behold there's a single light on.

Matt swears up and down he turned all of them off. I thought he did too considering it was completely dark outside his door the last time it was open. The light wasn't exactly hard to miss either.

Matt was a lot more bothered by it than I was. To this day he refuses to do something like that at his house again.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_oi8i3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/oi8i3/frme_something_in_the_basement_xpost_from_rnosleep/,

Anyway, I do paranormal investigating so I've had a lot of things happen, mostly like radios turning on, things turning up where they shouldn't be, odd knocking on walls. But this one stands out... and I’m sorry if it’s very long.

I was living in an on-campus suite with 3 other guys for about 6 months. One roommate, Jerry, was really open to spiritual things, but never really had much experience with it. One night it was just Jerry and I and he wanted to use a Ouija board. (I know a lot of people think they’re BS, and most of the time, they are if you use them incorrectly. But the few times I’ve used one I’ve had very interesting results)

So we sat down and started. Something started just going to different letters, not making any sense. Then the TV turned on to a blue screen (it would go directly to cable when turned on). So whatever, I turned it off and took the batteries out of the remote. He was freaked but I continued. The TV turned on again. So I removed everything attached to the TV just in case there was any interference or anything. Jerry wanted to stop after that so we did for the night.

For the next week I had horrible nightmares, usually involving ex-girlfriends and/or family members all dying. I never brought it up to anybody though until one night I had a dream that a ghost was in my bedroom and I was screaming “Go Away!” and pushing it towards the door. When I eventually opened the door, I jolted awake in a cold sweat. And my bedroom door opened. It wasn’t left open. I mean it swung about half way open. That’s when I realized that something was still here.

Jerry actually approached me the next day and told me about a dream he had about his whole family dying. I mentioned my series of nightmares. All my roommates stopped and mentioned that they have also been having dreams of loved ones dying. Well shit. This was bad.
Jerry and I decided to use the Ouija board that night while the other roommates were at class. It went to random letters again.  We took out the batteries to the remote, and we asked it to turn on the TV. TV turned on to the blue screen. We asked it to turn the TV off. TV turned off. We asked it again a few more times and it went on and off like we asked. I tried doing some EVPs but didn’t catch anything and the board wasn’t helping.

So I brought in a Wiccan friend who does a lot more spiritual things than I do. He picked up on it right away. It was him, (let’s call him Jack), Jerry, my other roommate, Jerry’s girlfriend, and myself. Jerry’s girlfriend was asleep on Jerry’s bed. Well after a while of not being able to communicate with it, Jerry wanted to go check on his girlfriend. So Jack, Jerry, and I go into his room, and Jerry walks up to his bed. As soon as he gets about a foot away from the bed, he arches his back in pain and jumps back. We go into the bathroom to check his back. 6 scratches on his back. It looked like something with 3 claws scratch him twice. One was on the right and shorter. Maybe about an inch and a half. The other one right diagonally across his back and must have been about 5 inches long. I have a picture of it on my old phone. If I get enough requests I’ll try and find it and see if I can upload it. Jack made us leave the apartment while he blessed it. I saw him prepare a cup of water, and pray over it. That was the last thing I saw before he blessed the apartment so I really have no idea what he did. But it seemed to work. Everything went back to normal after that.

After I did some research, I believe the spirit was a “Nachtmare.” Just a little demon that gets energy from people’s dreams

[Here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Demon_lovers_cover.JPG) is a picture of what they're believed to look like.

TL;DR Spirit was giving all of my roommates nightmares and would turn the TV on and off at our command. Escalated when one roommate was scratched and ended when we got the house blessed.

EDIT: I looked for my phone this morning before work. I thought I knew exactly where it was, but I guess I was wrong. Although I did find the charger for it there... Anyway, the phone also has some nudes of my ex girlfriend so I really need to find it.

My mother actually prompted me to ask him about it when I randomly asked if she had ever heard of any paranormal or ghost stories.

My father grew up in Union, Oregon, way out in the upper corner of the state. It's a fairly secluded town, with lots of farm land around. When my father was in his late teens or early twenties (during the mid-'70s), he was riding home in his friend's truck around two or three in the morning. They stopped on the side of the highway near the Hot Lake Hotel where they relieve themselves before making the final leg of the journey home.

As my father's friend, the driver, finished relieving himself a bright light came on above them. The beam it cast was at least a couple car lengths wide, and seemed to be circular. My father describes the light as extremely bright, but produced no sound. The source was at least a couple hundred feet up in the air, but he couldn't make out much of what it was coming from. After ten or fifteen seconds the light started moving across the field next to him and off into the distance. They couldn't make out the outline of the aircraft producing the light.

He wanted to write it off as a military aircraft or something, but only helicopters could hover in a way the light did, and yet no sound was produced. He said that years later he returned for a high school reunion, and after shooting the breeze with this friend, asked him without prompting if he remembered anything unusual about their drive home that evening. His friend recounted the story just as my dad remembered it, and that was the first time my mother ever heard the story.

I've prompted him multiple times to see if he was joking, and he says it happened, and there's nothing more he can say about it. He mentioned that there were some cow mutilations around that time as well, but everyone suspected that was more of a cruel joke than anything paranormal.

I believe he saw what he saw. I just don't have any better explanation for what happened than he does.

Reiki is a form of energy healing where the practitioner lays their hands on their client to balance their energy. All illness comes from energy imbalances.

I went with her to her reiki school once and allowed one of the students there to perform a session on me. Afterwards, I went home and was walking to my room when I felt a cold breeze come upon me from beside a bookcase. I stopped, looked at the space and walked towards it with my arm outstretched, feeling the air there.

It was cold.

""Is this a ghost?"" I thought. I stuck my hand behind the bookcase, it wasn't cold. I obtained a chair and pressed my hand to the ceiling vent, this wasn't cold either.

So I thought ""okay, maybe it is a ghost"" so I thought ""maybe it needs help."" So I motioned it to follow me and I grabbed a piece of paper and a pen, feeling a cold breeze wash over me.

I tried to communicate with it via pencil and paper but all I got was nonsense similar to this ""T...TT...P....C...T"" so I thought. ""Huh this isn't working."" And was like ""I dunno how to help it now.""

So then, that night as I am trying to go to sleep it feels as though it is either standing of floating beside my bed because I can still feel that cold breeze. Just as I am about to drift off to sleep I feel a nudge on my bed and am awake. I try to go to bed again, but I can sense the presence in the room with me and the nudge on my bed occurs again. So I sit up straight in my bed, frightened.

That presence wouldn't leave me alone for months. :(

I turned on my light and do not sleep well. In fact I don't sleep well for the next two months. The lights flicker. My body feels cold at odd times. My head constantly feels a swirling energy upon it right where the crown is. You know, that area on the head where in paintings of saints there's a halo. That's where I felt energy swirling...around and around, sometimes I could feel this halo growing, feeling cold or hot. It was like a beacon for me, of spiritual energy, it frightened me so much.

I couldn't watch scary stuff on TV or in movies because every time I did I would begin to energetically feel cold. Like something bad was going to come through if iw watpched or read enough bad stuff.

I would try to talk to stuff during this time. Close my eyes and my ""spirit guides"" questions and they would push my head right for yes or left for no, and forward for maybe, back for ""not sure"". Lol, its hard to explain, but I felt like stuff was around me all the time during this tme.
Sometimes the energy on my head would grow so hot that it would feel like there was a ring of fire on it, swirling around and around, pulsating. This was after I prayed to saint michael the archangel to come an protect me because I was afraid of feeling all the cold energies all the time. I felt this burning energy for 2 nights, then on the 3rd, it was gone.

I prefer to think I had a psychotic break for this period of time. The woman who did reiki on me, used to talk to stuff that wasn't there though. Maybe some of that leeched onto me for a short period of time.
Eventually I was able to explain everything away and now I am a very happy atheist, who tells herself she went psychotic at one point in time.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_m8nf5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/m8nf5/me_feeling_things/,
1320800271.0,13,self.Thetruthishere,m5ho8,[FR] My close friend has told me about 2 experiences that she has had with spirits,naengmyeon,14,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/m5ho8/fr_my_close_friend_has_told_me_about_2/,"My friend is of South East Asian descent (half Vietnamese, half Cambodian), but was born and grew up in the United States.  She has a had a few paranormal experiences that she has told me about.  I've known her for 16 years, ever since we were 13 years old, and I trust her.  

When she was in high-school, she woke up in the middle of the night once to see what appeared to be a small shadowy figure at the foot of her bed.  She felt it tugging at the blankets by her feet.  She hid under the covers, terrified, and after a few minutes peaked out.  She said that the figure had moved to the doorway, and seemed to be beckoning her.  It looked like the shadowy form of a little girl.  It seemed to want her to come out of bed, as if it wanted to play.  My friend just went under the blankets again, and eventually was able to fall asleep.  The next morning at breakfast she told her mom about it.  Her mom told her something that she had never known before.  My friend had had an older sister, that had died when she was very young.  This had happened before my friend was born.  Her mom told her that her older brother (about ten years older) had seen this spirit several times, and that it seemed to follow him around.  Ever since then my friend has been convinced that ghosts exist.

Another experience she had, that is totally unrelated to the first is this:  Her boyfriend's mom passed away from a disease, I believe it was Lou Gehrig's disease.  Soon after the funeral, her boyfriends father was out of town, and my friend went over to his house to stay with him while his father was gone.  They were sleeping in his parents room, because it was bigger and had a more comfortable bed.  One night, very late, they were laying in his parents bed, and they began to hear footsteps outside in the hallway.  They got scared, and her boyfriend (who is a skeptic, Christian, who went on to later become a marine and doesn't believe in any superstitious stuff) got a knife and went through the house.  He didn't find anything.  They returned to bed and a little bit later began to hear the steps again.  He investigated again, this time my friend went with him, again they found nothing.  A few minutes later the steps began again, this time getting louder and louder, until it sounded like someone was running up and down the hallway outside the bedroom.  They were obviously very scared by this point, and they just ignored it until it stopped.  An interesting fact is that her boyfriends mother hadn't really liked her.  

My friend has come to think that she has a stronger than average connection to the spirit world, and that she is more susceptible to its influence.  This isn't something that she seeks to follow, just something that she has realized about herself.  Vietnamese and Cambodian society is very superstitious, and her whole family completely accepts it and agrees that she has ""the gift.""",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_m5ho8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/m5ho8/fr_my_close_friend_has_told_me_about_2/,

Our favorite graveyard was a rather large one out in the middle of a cornfield. The town that used to surround it was long gone, and there were some very old graves, sometimes with sunken areas around the headstone where the coffins had collapsed. There was no grass around the front of some graves, which would have been a normal finding if they weren't from the 19th century. Even leaves in autumn wouldn't fall in front of those graves- it was always just bare dirt. 
As you can see, this graveyard was particularly creepy. There was always this doll there, lying on the ground. My sister bent over to poke at it once, and when she did she felt something brush against her lower back. We'd take our videocamera with us, and would frequently catch weird lights and noises that we didn't see when we were at the graveyard (if only I could figure out how to upload old camcorder tapes...). One night, we did a seance- we sat in a circle with a lit candle and tired to commune with spirits. It was uneventful and kind of boring. That is, until we got home and watched the tape. It went like this:

   Person 1: Remember that time something touched you on the back? (to my sister, about doll incident) 

   Sister: Don't even start...

   Me: (referencing the fact that we've had no luck in our seance) Well, at least that's one spirit we have in the graveyard.

To this day I haven't been able to figure out where the voice came from or what it's saying. It's talking closer to the camera and a lot higher than we were. I'm not sure how much I believe in the paranormal now that I'm grown up, but this still freaks me the hell out.

I love the concept, and would like to see it flourish.  With that said, I'm not a skilled writer.  I'll do my best to explain what happened.

Before I get started, there are a few important details.  First off, this all happens about a year ago.  I was going through a bit of a rough patch at the time.  I had recently graduated from college and moved to another town for work.  While I did know a few people around town, I hadn't seen them much, which was especially hard since I had grown accustomed to cohabitation and being on a college campus where it's almost impossible not to see friends every day.  So I was feeling very lonely basically.  Add to that the fact that I was at a new job where I was hired in anticipation for coming work, and suddenly I'm very lonely, and have 8 hours every day to do nothing but contemplate my loneliness.  Secondly, I am one of those people who usually think in an internal monologue.  This inner voice sounds like my speaking voice does.  After several years, I've come to recognize it pretty well.

So, this brings me to this odd event.  I was sitting in my office more or less just counting the minutes till I could go home.  All of a sudden I hear someone say ""hi!"".  This struck me as odd since I have a private office, and keep my door shut.  I glanced around to make sure no one had snuck in on me, and sure enough I was still alone.  Then I realized I hadn't actually heard the voice.  It was in my head.  Well, that startled me me a good bit, needless to say.  I began to get a little worried, since I know there are mental disorders that can cause things like this, and a mental disorder at that stage in life could easily cost me my job.  But then this foreign internal voice started comforting me, telling me I was not crazy, and that it was in fact real.

A quick aside, the other voice in my head was feminine, and thus was definitely not my own thoughts.  I'm not certain I didn't invent it out of my loneliness, but ""she"" (as I'll refer to the other voice for simplicities sake) got very offended when I brought up that idea.  Oh, right.  We had conversations.  It appeared she could hear my internal monologue, and thus my thoughts.  We conversed several times over a few days.  She demonstrated a disturbing amount of knowledge about me and seemed to almost be able to access my memories.  I asked several times who she was, if she wasn't just my imagination, but she always just got offended that I didn't believe she was real, and refused to give me a name or anything about who or what she was.  The best answer I got was something along the lines of ""you'll find out soon.""  That had me a bit worried (which I know she knew), and I eventually decided to treat the whole thing like a logical, scientific person should, and dismissed her entirely as a figment of my lonely imagination.  Well, she didn't appreciate that at all, but agreed to leave.

So why am I posting this, if I decided it was my imagination?  Because I'm actually not entirely convinced that she wasn't real.  Like I said, it's been around a year now, but I'm still a bit concerned about the whole finding-out-who-or-what-she-is-soon thing.  I also halfway wonder if she may still be around, just keeping quiet and listening to my thoughts, which is a rather uncomfortable idea itself.  So what do you all think?  Any ideas for what the heck was going on?",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_kvdka,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kvdka/another_voice/,

The first can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/iy86i/haunting_in_poland/).

A [link](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Boles%C5%82awa+Prusa+9,+Lublin,+Polska&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.254491,22.562552&amp;spn=0.000942,0.002411&amp;sll=51.254162,22.562082&amp;sspn=0.000942,0.002411&amp;t=h&amp;z=19) to the apartment in this story.

My second year in Poland I lived in a nice and relatively new apartment with a girl in my class.  It was a 5 story building with an internal stair case.  I lived on the third floor. As you opened the front door to my apartment immediately in front was the bathroom. To the immediate right was my roommate's bedroom, a small 12x15 room.  There is a short and narrow hallway that the kitchen opens out of and then at the end of the hallway was my room, a much larger 30x25ish room.

We were on spring break and had just returned from a week in Berlin. We still had 2 or 3 days of time off and decided to watch a movie in my room (equipped with couches and a T.V. that hung on the wall -- a luxury in Poland). The movie is boring me.

I go into the kitchen and begin to prepare dinner. Spaghetti. Dull and boring after so much of it during school. My roommate and friend are still watching the movie.

It's dark out and we're experiencing our first thunderstorm in Poland as students.

As I'm in the kitchen I hear the front door open and someone walk into my roommate's room.  Having people not knock was not uncommon as our apartment building was shared exclusively with students. People would come in all the time asking for this or that so we would leave the front door unlocked when we were home.  The door had been broken a little bit though so it would always make a loud noise when it was shut.

I assumed it was my girlfriend or my roommate's boyfriend.  

I ask, ""Hey, do you want me to make you spaghetti too?""  No response.

I walk back into my room and ask my roommate, ""Apeksha, is someone else supposed to be coming over?"" She says that she hadn't talked to anyone else all day.

I shout out to the unknown person hoping for a friendly response from someone I know.  Again, no response.  At this point my roommate and other friend come into the kitchen with me.  We hear footsteps and 30 seconds later the sound of her bed or wardrobe moving across the floor.  

Now we are freaked out.  I shout out again.  The noises stop only to start back up again a minute or so later.

This time the noises are louder and there is some banging. It sounds like someone is opening up some cupboards in her room or banging on her desk.  I pick up a knife, thinking that some random Polish skin-head had snuck in and was trying to steal stuff of ours (some Polish people tend to do that in the less secure apartment buildings because some of the amenities we have, as Americans, are hard to find there). 

The hallway and our whole apartment is always well lit. I quickly call my girlfriend and ask where she is. She is walking to my place and not very far, just down the hill. I tell her what is going on and she looks up at my roommate's window and tells me that the lights are going on and off. Everything else in the rest of the apartment was fine.  

Knife in hand, and my friend equipped with a slingshot armed with Peanut M&amp;Ms we make our way down the hallway. One, two, three deep breaths and we barge into the room expecting a fight.

Like I said, her room was small and there was definitely no one in there. Her room, however, was torn apart. The bed flipped on it's side, the wardrobe flung open and all of the clothes pulled out. All of the pictures she had (of her friends from back home and such) on the wall, were taken off and neatly stacked into two piles -- one pile of the pictures she was in, the other the one's that she was not in.  Between the two stacks of pictures was a locket of blonde hair, and black toenail clippings (painted black-- my roommate never painted her nails, especially not black).  On the window, written in lipstick was something written in Polish.  I type it into a translator and it said, ""I'll take your tongue next, dog.""

Like I said before, the door always makes a loud noise when it shuts. When I first heard the noise, I heard it open and close. Nothing more.  There is no way someone left.",,False,,t5_2sntx,True,,,True,t3_jm785,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/jm785/unwelcome_visitor_xpost_from_rnosleep/,

My parents had separated the year before and sold their old house. When my dad bought a new home it was three bedroom pier and beam house far on the outskirts of my east Texas hometown. The house wasn't much. Three bedrooms, one bathroom, a decent sized living room and a porch out back.

My dad wasn't there a whole lot. He runs a deer lease an hour away and stayed busy with his new girlfriend in another town. He did not sleep in the house very often, and very rarely stayed for more than a few hours. This left me alone in the house most of the time unless my girlfriend was over.


Strange things started happening a few months after we moved in.
I would hear footsteps walking up behind me. Voices in the dark of night, when I knew I was alone. The worst part of it was the shadow thing in my room. It was small. Only half the size of a fully grown man. But its arms were too long and its legs were misshapen. It appeared when the voices were the loudest and it crawled along the walls of my bedroom. Occasionally I would catch it watching me and I could see the faintest hint of yellow eyes peering out at me. It wasn't always well defined. It seemed to be the clearest when the voices in the house were yelling at each other. Most of the time I ignored it. Closing my eyes and turning on the light made it go away for the most part. But it would come back when the lights weren't on.


I tried hard at first to tell myself it was my over-active imagination. Or maybe it was just the neighbors were fighting. The footsteps just had to be the house settling. All the excuses I could muster would not stop that shiver from running down my spine or negate the feeling of being watched all the time.


The longer I was left alone, the worse things would get. I would sit at my computer in the living room and hear steps come from down the hallway towards me. Heavy thudding footsteps, like that of a large man, that would only end dirctly behind me. I would turn to find no one there of course, but the moment my attention was back on the computer the footsteps would head back down the hallway.
The voices could be heard anywhere in the house. Day or night, I thought I was going crazy, but other people heard them too. My girlfriend would often come back from the kitchen or the bedroom to ask me why I was yelling at her, when I hadn't said a word.


I started listening closer to the voices at one point. They were always the same two people I think. A man and a woman. I could never understand what was said, but the man was always angry, and the woman's replies would range from hurt to frustrated, and full of rage.
This went on for three years while I lived there. I did my best to stay out at night and sleep during the day. Then, one day a friend of mine came over and we started digging through the attic. We found an old ""portable"" record player (it was meant to be moved from one place to another but it weighed 50 pounds). It looked like it came from the 60's. It had a handle on it, and had to speakers that folded out to allow access to the player itself. In a sleeve meant to hold records we found dozens of old love letters. They were all from a girl named Jane to a boy named William. Some were meant to go to the boy, but there were a few that seemed more like notes to herself. ""Why does he have to hurt me."" ""He called me a worthless whore. What did I do?"" Some even made mention of him hitting her.


Well, we moved the record player, letters and all, into the living room until I could decide what to do with it. That's when things started focusing on the living room. More voices, more footsteps. One night when I was up late cooking all of the drawers and cabinets in the kitchen opened themselves at once.


A few weeks later, my dad had a garage sale and I stuck around to make sure the record player got sold.


I haven't seen an odd thing or heard a strange noise since. I do still wonder what that shadow thing was, The voices I could understand.

Four of us were sitting in the hallway of the floor were all the guys were staying. The hallway formed a T-like intersection and we were in crossroads, so to speak. There were, as I said, four of us. Myself, R, J, and N. N was the only female in our little group that night. We decided to do some simple 'experimentation.' Basically, it went like this: one of us would come up with something - an idea, an image, a place - and jot it down on a piece of paper that got handed to J. Then that person would try and visualize it, then project it. The other two would then try and open their minds up and 'see' what was being projected. Instead of saying anything out loud, we'd right down what it was that we thought was being projected. It went about as well as you expect.

Until we hit on something. If R or I were touching N, then our success rate went really really high. Not if she was projecting, only if R or I were. Not if she was receiving, only if R or I were. But also, only if he or I were touching her - holding her hand, having our knees touch, or the like.

Discovering this, we kept at until close to midnight. By that point, we were all (well, all of us except for J) tired. Both R and I had headaches. We said our goodnights to one another and each went off to our rooms, N heading upstairs to the girls' floor.

Some time later, I'm laying in my room, in bed, trying to fall asleep. I was drowsy, but just couldn't fall asleep. The faint bit of light coming in from the hallway was enough to give the room some illumination, but things just didn't feel right. Then the door opens. Light pours in from the hallway. R is standing there. He walks in - kind of stiff and wooden. Not quite shuffling. The walk of someone who is very weary perhaps. He walks into the room until he's standing beside my bed. Not looking down at me though. Just staring straight ahead. ""Hey, R,"" I said. ""What's going on?"" And in a voice that wasn't quite his own, a voice that was real monotone and somewhat deeper, he says, ""He is coming. The Dark Man is coming. He's seen."" And he stopped then. And laughed. But it wasn't his laugh. It was deep and alien. Creepy and unnatural. Then he stopped, just as suddenly, turned and walked out, closing the door behind him.

I was finally able to move. I realized I'd been holding my breath since he first started to speak. I lay there, panting slightly, wondering what the hell was going on. My eyes moved back from the door where R had just departed and back across the room to the windows on the far side.

There was a shadow there. Almost as if of someone standing outside, staring in. Or maybe someone outside somewhere casting a shadow against the wall of the dorm. But, at the same time, it seemed to be staring at me. It didn't move when the shadows from the bushes and trees moved. It just stood there, still, staring. A cold feeling of dread filled me. I couldn't look away from the shadow. I could shut my eyes, but the feeling of being watched only got stronger, and it felt as if there was a presence, a heaviness in the room. Eyes open, the shadow just stood there, watching.

Eventually, I fell asleep. Too exhausted to do anything else.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_ji41k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ji41k/the_dark_man_xpost_from_nosleep/,

1311784968.0,13,self.Thetruthishere,j1aa4,Two of my experiences. [Long],k2themainframe,15,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/j1aa4/two_of_my_experiences_long/,"Hello TTIH. I am going to relate to yall two experiences that I have had in my life that I really truly can't account for. 

The first one happened when I was with one of my oldest friends at his university in rural Ohio. I came to visit for a family weekend, or visitors weekend. The university had set up a bunch of activities for families to do together and tours of the campus and whatnot. Me being 5 years younger than my buddy, (Who shall be named B from now on.) I was very interested in the history of this old college out in the sticks of Ohio. 

We had spent the day on Saturday walking around and checking out stuff, I believe it was during Winter Quarter, because it was freezing outside, we decided to go back to his dorm. B, being the type of older friend, sort of a brother to me, (He and his sister used to babysit me back in the day.) he of course liked to mess with me and tease me sometimes. Nothing really malicious just jokes and what we would now call ""trolling"". He knew that ghost stories and paranormal stuff freaked me right out, so he casually mentioned that the corner dorm was haunted. Of course I wanted to go check it out immediatley. B decided that we should chill and eat some food and hang out for a bit. So it was about 11 or midnight when we decided to go to the said dorm room. 

Let me give you a little bit of background info to paint the picture in your mind. This was in 1999 or 1998, and the dorm we were in was old. Old as in like, sweet orange carpet, thick wooden dorm doors, and older 70s (or early 80s) decor. The dorm itself was shaped like a box with rooms all around the outside.Bathrooms in the center elevators and stairs at the middle of the ""box"". The haunted dorm was a corner dorm, and was pretty good sized. Not huge but very comfortably spaced for two college kids to live in. 

B knew the dudes who lived in the dorm currently, as he said earlier in the night that the University was having trouble housing people, I'm not sure if this is true, this is what B told me and I trust him. After what I experienced, hah I believe him.

So we head down to the dorm, it' at the end of a creepy kind of hallway, its 11:30 pm, and its quiet. I can't hear anything, the lighting is somewhat dim, but not dark, and my 9th grade heart is beating like mad. I scare pretty easily with paranormal stuff, and I knew some fucked up shit was going to happen. Anyway we get to the dorm, and the guys are inside hanging out. B introduces us as asks if anything crazy has happened lately. The guys kinda laugh look at each other and quickly say no. At this point I the am standing right by the door, which I have just shut. It's a pretty heavy door, with a good sized lock and doorknob on it. The guys and B are talking and all of a sudden a gust of wind(?) kind of blew around the room and moved all of their curtains off of the windows. My hair stood on end, B looked at me with a strange horrified look on his face, the two roomates stood up and quickly headed towards the door. I turn quickly and try to open the door, but it's stuck! It wont turn for shit, like someone is holding it down on the other side. By now everyone in the room me, B, and the two roomates, are behind me yelling to open the door. At this point I clearly remember the temp in the room had dropped considerably. I couldn't see my breath or anything but it was definitley chillier. Finally B grabs the door and twists the handle with all that hes got, and the door opens. We all pile out into the dimly lit quiet hallway, with crazy looks, scared smiles, and gallows humor as an attempt to rationalize what has happened. Heres the best part, we left the door open, and at most colleges the doors are set up to close after you open them, like a door at a deli or an emergency door. That was not the case at B's Uni, it was older and unrenovated. Anyway, I book down the hallway with a litanly of ""Nope, nope, nope."" B and the roomates are behind me, as they want to go hangout with some other people. About 20 feet from the dorm, one of the roomates goes to close and lock his door, when he's about 3 feet from it, (I had turned around to see where B was.) The door slams shut right in front of him. That shit freaked me out.

Second Experience

This was about a year or so later, also in the winter, right after my Grandfathers death. I was 16. Grandad and I had a great relationship, we always hung out whenever I could get my parents to take me to Granddad and Grandmas house out in rural central Ohio. We also are the only two in our family to have blue eyes, and red/blonde hair. We were really close. This guy would crawl into old refrigerator boxes in the basement and play War with me when I was little, and he was in his 70s, what a bad ass Grandad right? Anway, Grandad had a stroke and also had blood cancer so I knew right away that he wasn't long for this world. The last time I saw him he was in his hospital bed, he could only use 1/2 of his body, but as I was about to leave, he grabbed my hand and told me ""K2, you're going to be a good man someday."" He loved me he believed in me and I was special to him. He died on 12/24/2000. Christmas Eve. Went out like a boss. Anway about two weeks later I was crashed out in my room still mourning the loss of one of my heros. I took it pretty well, I only cried at the cemetery, but for some reason that night I really missed him. Call it a delayed response or whatever, but I was really tore up. It was about 1 am and I was half asleep, crying/praying trying to fall asleep when I heard footsteps outside my door, and then nothing. I figured it was just my parents or sister using the restroom at night and wrote it off to that. What happens next, still 11 years later, fills me with a range of emotions, from hope to fear to sadness to happiness. I was laying on my stomach when something (Grandad I hope.) literally tucked the covers around me tighter and gave me a hug. I was sleeping on my stomach with my head turned the other way, so I didnt see anything, but I also didn't hear the door open, or close. I stuck my head out of the covers to be greeted by a dark room, snow falling outside, and silence. I'm still convinced to this day, that it was my Grandad, reassuring me that everythings ok, and hopefully that I'll see him again someday.

Sorry for the length, I just wanted to illustrate my two experiences. Thanks for reading.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_j1aa4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/j1aa4/two_of_my_experiences_long/,

A friend of mine and I were sitting in a home I recently moved into. We had just watched a few shows on hauntings, ghosts, demons and things of that nature. Obviously, our own stories would pour from us to each other to pass the time. 

Finally, we ended up on the subject of EVP's and the like. I pointed out I have a computer that is set up with a microphone and necessary software to make our own EVP. He suggested we simply record without actually trying to communicate with any ghosts or spirits. 

Below is a link to an AUDIO recording of a piece of that session. In it you hear two voices that are not mine, nor my friends. One is saying *I'm about to punch him in his jaw* and another giggles. The software I used on my computer has a voice recognition setting that recognized both soundbites as human voices. A middle aged male and female. *the male threatens the punch, and the female giggles*.

Here is a transcript of the audio to help place the EVP's.

[EVP](http://www.keepandshare.com/doc/440566/evp-edit-mp3-march-5-2008-9-32-pm-563k?da=y)

WARNING! My laugh and berp are kinda loud, after that you can turn it up without too much trouble.

*first sound is the end of a sneeze* 

me ""Wasn't me....""

Friend ""then found out that, that house was known to be haunted""

Me *laugh* then *berp* ((yes it made me feel better))

*silence for a bit*

Me ""See I would be provoking it right now but.......""

Disembodied voice ""I'm about to punch him in his jaw....""

Friend ""What?""

Me ""I would be provoking it now..""

Other disembodied voice *giggle*

*and then no other EVP's on this sound bite. Just wanted to share.*

WARNING! My laugh and berp are kinda loud, but after that you should be able to turn it up to hear the other voices.

After we played it back a few times and my friend actually heard the voices. . . . .. He had to sleep in my room cause he was a bit scared, he was 26 and my wife wasn't exactly happy about having him sleep on the floor for a few nights. :D",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_j0bx8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/j0bx8/great_reaction_to_evp_xpost_from_nosleep_haters_d/,
1311697822.0,15,self.Thetruthishere,j0a0g,Another happening from my more recent past.,CobaltSmith,16,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/j0a0g/another_happening_from_my_more_recent_past/,"Ok, it's been a bit since I've posted and things don't appear to be going too hot here just yet. Here is another from my more recent past.

My wife and I moved into a 3 bedroom *rather small* home. We were renting and the landlord was barely better then a slum lord IMO. The house, however, was very old. Somewhere around 80 to 100 yrs. (we had found a few things about this house in the library dating back to 1918) 

Before we were settled we decided on rooms, my kid's got the largest room, my wife and I the middle size room, and my wife's brother got the smallest room *not much size difference between the three*. All three where on the second story. However, my kid's room ended up being really really creepy and my kid's would NEVER sleep in there. 

Occasionally, we would try to have them sleep in there and they wouldn't, they would end up coming into our room in the middle of the night. So, after a time, this was a fairly common occurrence. One night however, I was trying to fall asleep (I have a very hard time getting to sleep) when I heard my daughter come into the room. 

Now, from time to time she would be half asleep and she has a bit of my sleep walking issue that I used to have as a kid. So, she would just stand in front of me waiting for me to notice her and tell her to just get in bed. This night, it appeared, was one of those nights. 

Now, our room was set up such that when I lay down, I was facing the crib *where we would put our son* that we moved from the creepy room for obvious reasons, and about a two foot gap between the crib and our bed. Just enough room to get back and forth. 

So, my daughter came walking in, and apparently was just going to stand in front of me until I told her to get in bed. I opened my eyes, saw her standing there, told her to get back to bed and she didn't move. So, after a moment of not moving I got a bit more stern with her, my eyes open all the way at this point. Still, she didn't move. So, I figured she must still be asleep. 

I reached out and went to touch her shoulder to gently wake her and my hand passed right threw her. Now, to be clear, it was very very dark and I couldn't make out any features of her face but I could see her hair and height and all that. I KNEW *before reaching out* that my daughter was standing in front of me. When my hand passed threw her or it, my entire body went numb.

It remained standing there with an ever so slight swaying back and forth motion, which I had attributed to my daughter being sleepy before hand, now it just scared the hell out of me. When my hand passed threw it, I jumped back and said (rather loudly) WOH.. My wife woke up, looked over and said ""It's just (daughters name) tell her to get in bed."" 

The MOMENT she said that the figure in front of me dispersed as if exploding. No force or anything, just the form separating and traveling off in all directions. It was dead silent and my wife had no idea what happened. When we woke the next day, our daughter was sleeping in my wife's brothers room, which is something she had never done before and never did since.

I told her what happened the next day and she told me she remembered waking up and seeing our daughter, but had no idea anything was out of the ordinary.

For timeline, this took place about a year or two before the trailer incident, or as you know it ""Was I hallucinating? I'm still not sure to this day..""

1375630085.0,12,self.Thetruthishere,1jolgq,My friends and I have experienced a series of rather strange things.,Urn_the_Reaper,21,9,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1jolgq/my_friends_and_i_have_experienced_a_series_of/,"Hello, I have a lot to talk about and even more questions. I'll start of by saying my name is Aaron, and yes it's my real name and I don't care. My friends however will be referred to as ""D"" and ""K"", the first being my best male friend, the second my best female friend. The three of us have all dealt with a lot of creepy things in our lives, but the past couple years have made me feel like things on the other side are, to put it simply, fucked up.
   
 I apologize for the language if it bothers you, but it's the best way I can describe it. I'll begin with the stories I know best, my own. I have always been watched. Since I was young, I've always been aware of things being around me. But not like the ""I spoke to dead people"" as a kid, more of sensing presences and little stuff like that. But there was a certain spirit at what is now my fathers home that really disliked me.
   
 This particular spirit was seen was by me as a 3 year old, so the descriptions are iffy. What I do know is that the spirit would only show itself to me late at night when I wandered downstairs needing to use the bathroom. I would tell my parents of a man chasing me through our home and up the stairs, but NEVER making it into my room, which became an established safe zone in that home for me.
   
The spirit was never seen by me again, however both of my younger brothers reported seeing this guy as well...both when they were 3. The hallway he appeared in is to this day a place I feel eyes on me, but the feeling has grown weak since I have not lived in the home permanently in a long time. However, this was all not the end of me being watched by things. 
  
 After my parents divorced, I eventually ended up living with my mother due to issues with my father that are not important here. The point is I was away from the home the spirit resided in, that a psychic also claimed was a house of evil and refused to go to it. Even though I had felt no spirit in my new home meant me harm (I had good encounters at least twice), there was the night that was changed. 
   
To start this off, no it was not sleep paralysis. As I was laying down to sleep, my ears began to ring very loudly. I passed this as normal activity as I tend to hear a lot of ringing. It gets louder and more intense until it feels like someone is digging screwdrivers into my eardrums. I keep trying to sleep and even with the pain manage to hit that lull of your brain switching off and letting sleep take over, the final remembered moments before you dream to be exact. "" I FOUND YOU "" played in my head, I have a lot of controlled internal voices, and I knew this on was not from anywhere in my brain. It was gravely, and disturbingly excited to find me, almost like I was it's prey.
   
I was immediately wide awake. I shot up, gathered my pillows and comforter, and slept in the living room of my basement space. Luckily for me, that room had been made out of extra storage space in the actual basement, the rest of the finished space now serves as my ""apartment"". So I no longer can sleep in that room, or stay in there too long at night and its been over a year.
   
Then there was the night I guess was a show of strength on my part. The night I could feel so many spirits closing in, and trying to mess with my head. They got close, made me feel uneasy and scared. I couldn't see them, but I could feel them circling me. I don't know if the images in my head were accurate depictions of them, but they were terrifying nonetheless.
   
 I eventually got very, very angry. To clarify, the home I no longer lived in, seemed to cause extreme anger. When I did go back and forth, my classmates in high school would comment on my mood changes occasionally. So anger is something I learned to control, but it burst forth that night and I lost control. 
  
 I threatened anything and everything near me. It sounds silly, telling invisible people to leave you alone or you'll hurt them, but I did it. Then the last one showed up. It did nothing but closely and quickly circle me, and I felt almost as if a tether was connecting me to it. I began to feel sick to my stomach, which made me angrier than before. I don't really know what happened, but something made the thing disappear. Not leave, just poof away like it never existed. 
  
 The others left too. My usual nightmares stopped, until last week. I personally know why things changed for only a week, but that is a subject more for telling interested parties. the point is I was knowingly open to the paranormal for a week and two big things happened. First, I woke up one night to my pants having been removed and tossed to the floor on the opposite side of the bed. Normally I would remember doing this, but I didn't. I will not say without doubt this incident was paranormal, but it was strange. 
  
 Then I had my first real nightmare in ages. They always have a meaning I suppose, but this was a direct message to me I believe. 
  
 In the dream I'm stood up in my bedroom. The wall opposite my bed (where I look if I'm looking at my feet in bed) has two closets with sliding doors. My cat like to open them at night, and when I saw them just barely slid open in the dream I took the natural next step, and went to close them. Then the voices started. "" Were watching you "" 
over and over and more joined in each time. I backed up until it hurt and I felt trapped, then it ended.
   
There are more stories for me, but to sum up my friends' experiences K is tormented by a single spirit that constantly influences her dreams to show her horrific things that could happen in her life. Regularly dreaming of ways the few people you care about dying in terrible ways takes a toll on you. I want to help her but I'm not sure entirely how to get rid of the spirit.
  
 D however is regularly speaking to a spirit and dabbling in Astral Projection, which I'm not entirely sure is a real thing. The spirit he speaks to is friendly and usually gives out information, but not enough to bring my friends and I to a 100% understanding of everything.
  
 I'm not sure what to do at this point. Things have become so quiet paranormally speaking in my life that I'm not sure if it's just coincidences or not. I'd like to talk to some people who are familiar with this kind of thing and maybe have a new perspective to share. Also if anyone is a claimed psychic that thinks they can verify this stuff, I'm more than open to listening to you. 
  
 I will clarify quickly that both of my friends live far away. One is states away, the other is in another country and we've met on very low chances. I'm sure that has nothing to do with anything, but it limits my options. 
  
 I'm up for telling the rest of my stories, even though most are my nightmares that I know are linked to something other than my brain.

1375059207.0,13,self.Thetruthishere,1j8vsa,[ME][FAM] Experiences with a ghost child.,Lillieah,17,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1j8vsa/mefam_experiences_with_a_ghost_child/,"So I stumbled upon this reddit the other day and figured here would be a good place to share my experience.

This happened to me back when I was in high school living in Canmore, Alberta in the Rocky Mountains. We lived up in one of the newer subdivisions on the mountain side, Eagle Terrace. Anyway, this place being a relatively new area I never once thought that it was possible that our house could've been haunted. Usually you hear stories of ghosts being present in homes at least 100 years old, but our house was maybe 10 if that.

Anyway to continue on, the first experience happened to my younger sister, who was 10/11 at the time. She and the youngest (8/9) shared a room on the upper west side of the house over the garage. My youngest sister, we'll call her Kay for privacy's sake, was out visiting her friends just down the road this particular day, while I was out in Calgary visiting my friend Laura. My mother was home and down in the living room playing on her lap top, while my younger sister, we'll call her Sam, was in her room doing... well I can't remember what she was doing precisely, either drawing, doing homework or reading but I digress.

While sitting there alone in the room she heard the distinct sound of a small object hitting the carpet by her bed. At first she ignored it, the second time she became curious, and the third time she had actually seen a quarter hit the floor and roll under her bed. Sam was a complete OCD neat-freak by this point in her life so when she went to go get it from under the bed she found absolutely nothing. No sign of the coin. A little aggravated, she went back to her task and again, began to hear the soft noise of something landing on the carpet beside her bed. This time when she looked down she seen a tennis ball much like the one that belonged to our littlest dog mickey roll beneath her bed.

She yelled at the top of her lungs for my sister Kay to stop being disruptive and went to go retrieve the ball from under the bed. Just as my mother called back out to her that Kay was not home, Sam found that there was no tennis ball under her bed. There was absolutely nothing. She ran screaming from the room and wouldn't return until Kay came home.

The next two memorable encounters had actually happened to me. One time when I was home alone with the dogs/bird and the other with my now ex.

So the first encounter was actually during mid-day on a Saturday. Both my sisters were out playing with their friends while my mother and step-father were out at work. I had gone down to the kitchen to fix myself a snack as I usually just stayed to my room upstairs and played a variety of PSone and PS2 video games. As I walked from the fridge to the island in the kitchen, turkey in hand to make a sandwich our black lab, Jojo just stopped following me and just froze for a moment. What happened next made the hairs on the back of my neck rise. She stared right at the kitchen sink, let out a low growl as hackles rose and she bared her teeth. She kept it up to as I stood frozen, looking on at absolutely nothing. This is the scariest I ever remember her being.

The bird, Fred (I know right? The names my family came up with....) was eerily quiet, he was a cockatiel and loved to chirp loudly at least every thirty seconds and the smallest dog mickey was hiding under the kitchen table. After a good minute or two, which actually felt like eternity, I walked over to the sink and ran my hand through the air. It was cold and then suddenly, it wasn't and the animals stopped their odd behavior and went back to being their cheerful selves like nothing had just happened... I quickly abandoned my sandwich for a bag of chips from the cupboard and ran back upstairs. Not wanting to be in the kitchen anymore despite the animals being happy-go-lucky once more.

The final encounter about two months before we moved, several months after the kitchen encounter, I was once again home ""alone."" My mom, step father and sisters had gone to Calgary to go to a swim meet for my sister Sam and would be staying overnight for the second part of it the next day.

It was late that night and my ex at the time had been over (I had permission from my mom, don't worry!) We were sitting on the couch, watching TV and dosing as it was going on 1 am when my ex jolted and jostled me awake. I hadn't noticed at this point that Fred had been deadly quiet the whole time but I did notice the small dog mickey shivering next to me on the couch. Jojo remained oblivious by my feet, so maybe that's why we both dismissed the fact that my ex had said he seen a face peeking around the corner from the kitchen into the living room. We attributed it to the exhaustion and he opted to head home. As I began walking him to the door, we rounded the corner out into the kitchen which led to an open area with the front door and a flight of stairs going up. As I looked up I froze. On the first landing on the stairs, stood a little girl. She had long brown curly hair, pale skin, no shoes and was wearing a white dress. She had no eyes from what I could tell and this is when I knew what I was seeing was real cause Jojo stopped dead again and was staring with me. I looked to my ex and blinked a few times and the little girl was gone.

My ex still had to go home that night. But I flicked on every light, dragged both dogs upstairs with me, and fell asleep with all the TV's on and the house lit up bright. When I told my mother about the final experience she told me about my sisters experience which I shared and told me it was probably just a playful and curious little girl as it never really did much else than pester my younger sister with an array of invisible toys.

I've since tried to do research on the area, even though Canmore is a very very very old mining town, the area where I had been living was all mountain/forest with very little back story up until the ~10 years previous, so unfortunately I couldn't find all that much aside from the typical ghost stories from around the town. All I know is despite the ghost being friendly (I never really did feel threatened or malicious intent while living at this house) it was still the creepiest thing I've seen to see a little girl in a white dress standing on my landing.

If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer them. I know my writing probably seems to be everywhere but I was just writing as it came back from memory. I have a couple more stories I'd like to share in the future revolving around ghost experiences from me and my family. Unfortunately I don't have anymore from the Canmore house.

(So if you go into my history and find nothing...thats why).

This happened when I was about twelve. For some background info, my bedroom was setup like [so](http://i.imgur.com/G7klZUf.png) (the red X will become relevant later). 

I had woken up early and was bizarely awake; I was facing my side table and I looked at the clock- 5:05 AM. It was that time of the year when 5 o'clock wasn't pitch black but there was enough of the rising sun to see the outlines of everything in the room. I turned over in my bed and that's when I saw it. It was a black, amorphous shadow that seemed to be looking in my direction. It looked like [this](http://i.imgur.com/vFlIfh9.png)- literally like a stereotypical ghost shape but completely black and opaque. It was above my trashcan where the red X was in the picture. It was about five feet in length, maybe less. And I should mention that I looked at this directly for a few seconds; it was not in my peripheral vision. I should also mention that I genuinely don't think it was a shadow of an object in my room either.

I froze. I couldn't move or scream but go the energy to pull the blankets over my head. From there I formulated a plan. For some reason I ruled out turning on the lamp right next to my bed and decided my best bet was to turn on the light switch in my room next to my door. I counted to ten and ran as fast as I could and turned the light on. I turned back and it was gone. My parents' bedroom was right across from mine and I SCREAMED down the hallway. My parents had been startled awake from hearing me yell and I told them what happened.

They comforted me and I slept in between them the rest of the night, but then another thing happened. I'm not sure if I was hallucinating because I was so worked up or what but I remember this just as clear as that creepy black blob I saw. 

Do you remember that episode of Jimmy Neutron where they shrink themselves down and fight bacteria or something? I saw these over-sized bacteria-esque things crawling onto and off the bed. They looked like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/YpqZHmt.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/YpqZHmt.png) They were semi-see-through and stood about a foot tall. They had thin, spindly legs that walked past. They seemed mechanical in nature. They acted like they were not sentient of me or my parent's existence. I woke my mom and dad up and asked them if they were seeing these things and they told me it was my imagination, that I was safe and that I should try to fall asleep.

I have never seen them again but I see shadows out the corners of my eyes. To this day, as an adult, this memory still scares the crap out of me. I don't know what I saw, but I hope I never see it again.

Both of us have had some some pretty convincing paranormal encounters. My Mom's are down right spooky, which is why I have chosen to include them.

My Mom's experiences started when she was a little girl. Her family was pretty poor (Dad was a plumber, Mom worked in a factory), and for several years they lived in an old victorian mansion that had been converted into ""apartments"". She and her sister shared a room that had originally been a dining room or a parlour of some sort, and had an old turn dial telephone installed on the wall. They never bothered to take it down. Then, my Mom started to hear it dial at night. She would wake up to the sound of a number being dialed (slow turn, let go, slow turn, let go, slow turn, let go), and would see a shadow by the phone. She would lay awake terrified at night, but her sister never heard it so her parents did not believe her. It never got past that, they eventually moved and she had no more incidents as a child. 

Fast forward to her young adult hood. She got married young, and she and her husband moved into an older home. Soon after they moved in, they got a new puppy. Their dining room had a tile floor and two doors that closed, so they put the puppy in there at night. A few nights after they got the puppy, they were sound asleep when they heard a loud crash. It woke them both up, so they went through the house together checking rooms (her husband was a police officer). When they got to the dining room, the puppy was shaking under the table in a puddle of pee. In the dining room there was a huge old stone fireplace. On the mantle was a box with wine glasses and a wine decanter. Someone had taken the lid off the box, taken out the wine glasses and decanter, and smashed every one 
into the fireplace. From the sound of it, they had all been smashed at once. The dining room was an interior room with no doors or windows to the outside, so this person would have had to break into the house, head to the dining room, smash the wine glasses, and make it out past my Mom and her husband searching the house, while leaving all of the exterior doors and windows intact and locked. 

A few years later, my Mom was driving to work one night (she worked the night shift at the same factory my grandmother had worked at), when a little boy ran in front of her car. He looked to be about 8 or 9, had blonde hair, and was wearing blue jeans and a red and white striped shirt. She was sure she had hit him. She slammed on the brakes, and jumped out of the car. She walked all around her car, and even looked under it, and there was no little boy.  She was pretty shaken, but after a few minutes she got back in her car and drove to work. After her shift, she was driving back home with two friends in the car (they worked together and her friends lived on the way, so she was giving them a ride home) when, at the same spot on the same road, the little boy ran in front of her car again, this time going in the opposite direction across the road. She slammed on her breaks again, and once again, no little boy. Her friends never saw the kid, but they said she was pale and shaking, and they could tell that she had seen something. 

Lets fast forward for the sake of the length of this post. I was born years later, and we moved into the house we still live in when I was 4. When I was about 11 or 12, I became terrified of a particular hallway in my house. It connected the back door, the pantry, and the kitchen. I had lived in this house for most of my life and never been afraid, but this hallway suddenly horrified me. It was so bad that I would run as fast as I could to cross it itif I needed to pass through at night.  I told my Mom that there was something bad there, but she told me I was being silly. Then one morning, as I was getting ready for school, I heard my Mom scream my name from the kitchen. The panic in her voice made me think she had cut off a finger or something. I ran into the kitchen, and my Mom asked ""Was anyone in here?"". I was super puzzled. My sister was still asleep, I had been brushing my teeth in the bathroom, and no one else but my Mom was home. I asked why, and she told me that she had turned around from the counter, and seen someone standing in the doorway (the one that led to the scary hallway). I couldnt help but feel a little smug, lol. I had warned her. After that, I was never afraid of the hallway again. All of the ""bad"" was gone out of it, like it had used all of it's energy to show itself. Its been over 10 years since then, and nothing.

Originally, I thought every post on r/nosleep was pretty much true, but it's good to know I can share this story where people will believe it did happen. 

This happened to my aunt and cousins over 25 years ago. My aunt at the time had two children (my cousins). They were about 4 and 6 at the time. 

They had just moved into an old house that had previously been owned by an old farmer and his wife. The farmer had died and his wife, unable to take care of herself, had been moved into an assisted living facility. 

My aunt with my cousins moved into the house and there seemed to be nothing wrong. The only one that seemed to not like the house was my cousin Kayla, who was 4 then. While my aunt and my other cousin, Brandon seemed to find nothing wrong with the house, Kayla was scared. 

Kayla would often tell my aunt about the ""ucky"" man that would wander the halls of the house. Blaming Kayla's vivid imagination, my aunt just blew it off. After several accounts of Kayla being frightened, both my aunt and Brandon started hearing cabinets and doors slam. On occasion they would even find a door wide open that had been closed and locked before. 

One night, my aunt woke to a scream. She ran into Kayla's bedroom to find her face pale and her entire body trembling in fear. My aunt slowly walked in and asked Kayla what was wrong. Kayla managed to say "" T-the ucky man is standing there at the end of my bed and he won't leave."" My aunt looked and saw absolutely nothing. She walked nearer to where Kayla described the figure to be standing and was overcome with chills. The temperature in that area was a good ten degrees colder than the surrounding area. Kayla then told my aunt that the man had disappeared as man aunt had walked in. 

Realizing how scared Kayla really was, my aunt called in a medium. When the medium arrived she immediately sensed a presence. The medium continued on to try and communicate with the spirit. After a few minutes of this, the medium turned to my aunt and asked ""Is there a Margaret that lives here? My aunt, whose name is Caroline, had no knowledge of anyone named Margaret. 

Looking in to the history of the precious owners, my aunt learned that their names were Margaret and Ben. My aunt then turned back to Kayla for her to describe how the figure looked in better detail. She said he looked ""ucky like a grandpa"". Deducing that the man was the deceased farmer, my aunt collected prayed and blessed the house. She then spoke to the spirit and said ""Your wife is no longer here, sir. You are scaring my daughter, please leave us be."" She also told the place where his wife was living. 

After this, the back door slammed and Kayla never saw the ucky man again. There were rumors that a spirit stayed in one area of the assisted living after that, however. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1h01np,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1h01np/ucky_man/,

First time I was about ten years old in IKEA with my sister and her husband,and I was playing hide and seek with him while she made important decisions about lighting fixtures.I hid behind some curtains that were against a wall and felt hands go around my neck through the curtains.It was only for about five or ten seconds but I was scared.Got out of the curtains the second they let go and there was no one close enough to be the one who did it. Brushed it off,as 10 year olds do.

14,living with said sister. Come home after school to an empty house (not uncommon) and go take a nap. I woke up (or didn't?) to what I thought was sleep paralysis. I couldn't move but I could see. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary but I could feel hands grabbing my arms. When I could finally move I bolted from my room,ran downstairs and watched tv till they came home

17,just got home from an all night four wheeling session. Walking up the stairs at my dads house and a hand pushes into the center of my chest,pushing me back. I grabbed the railing and saved myself,looked around,no one again.

22 (just a few months ago,about a week after giving birth to my daughter) It's like 2 a.m. and I just got done feeding her and put her back to bed,but my bladder still pretty much hated me so I was peeing every time I got up.TMI but whatever. walked across to the bathroom,peed and was walking back to my bedroom when I felt a hand go around my ankle,completely tripped and was just lying on the floor for a few minutes,worrying about my stitches. The hand let go as soon as I hit the floor. Again no one around. SO working nights,no one but me and baby in the house,besides SO's mom,who was staying to help with the baby while I recovered.She was downstairs,heard the thump and came to help,so I got to hear her wake up and come up the stairs.

This is the most paranormal thing that has ever happened to me so I like to put in a lot of detail when telling it. Skip the first paragraph if dont want the background story. This is 100% real by the way.

Happened about 5 years ago, I was 18 at the time. I live in Arizona and if you havn't already guessed....it's hot as hell here. It was Summer so days &amp; nights usually consist of staying indoors and laying next to fans. My friends and I were always trying to keep ourselves occupied. I suggested one night we try a Ouija Board out, so sure enough we ran down to the mall and bought one. It was my friend (we'll call him John), my other friend (we'll call her Brianna) and myself. My friend Brianna has an very unusual Irish last name but for the sake of this story we'll say it's Turkleton? (this will be important later on). It was late, probably pushing Midnight when we opened the box to try it out. We went into my room, locked the door, sat on my bed and all lightly put our fingers on the planchette and to our expectations...nothing happened. Now this went on for a good while. We would take turns inviting spirits and what not to talk to us and about 15 mins in, the damn thing starts moving. 

It was slow, but gradually spelling out words. ""Hi...How are you...What are you doing?"" etc. We would ask it questions and it would slowly point yes or no. We finally asked what his name was only to get no answer. After asking about 5 more times and pleading he give a name, it started spelling out letters. T-U-R-K...and without finishing my friend Brianna starts crying and yells out Grandpa Rob?? The planchette literally yanked itself to the ""Yes"" sign. I wish I could show you how incredible the force was when it to the ""Yes"" sign. It was like something straight out of the movies. I get goosebumps just thinking about it. She pushes the board off my bed and sat crying for a bit. We all start freaking out and decide to keep talking.   We asked if he was still there it spelled out, ""Hi Bobo."" (that's what he called her when she was a kid). She starts crying more and now we're really starting to ask questions. Is there a God... is there an afterlife, and he would only tell us that he wasn't allowed to share that with us and that we had to figure it out on our own. We sat in amazement, talking till Dawn. I could sit and tell you all the things he said but I won't waste your time. We decided to end it so my friend Brianna stood up and said her I love you's and her her goodbyes and without us even touching the board the fuckin' planchette moved to ""Goodbye.""

We got obsessed with it after that wich wasn't a good thing. I became a kind of a dark-person because of it. I had wrapped my life into it. My friend John and I would even go to Cemeteries to talk through the Ouija. I'm better now. Had a few more paranormal things happen here and there but I just had to share that experience with you all.

My grandmother has an old cross made of palms that my uncle (father of my cousin) gave her for Palm Sunday when he was younger. According to my mom, my grandmother saw the cross look like it was about to catch fire, like the edges were embers sort of. Now, my grandmother absolutely refuses to believe in things like this, so she probably passed it off as a dream, but the thing is, she saw it on the night of my cousin's funeral.

Fast forward to November 2012. The trial for the kid who shot my cousin had finished that evening. The kid got off completely free. Anyways, I was laying in bed in my dorm (I'm in college about a 5 minute drive from where he was killed). As I was laying there thinking about the verdict and how unfair it was, I felt something brushing my arm, like someone was stroking it, kind of like what you do to comfort a loved one. I thought it was my fan so I moved out of the path of the air from it. Not even 2 minutes later, I felt it again. I got this crazy thought, maybe my cousin was actually in my room with me. Crazy, since I hadn't seen him for about a year to a year and a half before he was killed. 

Anyways, I tried talking to him. I whispered, ""CJ, is that you?"" and the feeling stopped. I asked him to do it again if it was really him, and sure enough, I felt something brushing my arm again. I asked him to stop, and it stopped. I did this a few more times and each time I got the same result: I asked to stop, it stopped; I asked to start again, it started again. The last time, I said, ""OK CJ, I know it's you. You can go now if you'd like."" I felt one last stroke and it was gone.

Now, I've had plenty of experiences at home but none in my dorm before or after the one with my cousin, none that I can prove anyway. I like to think it was him saying goodbye and that he's OK, even though his killer got let off. It's even more comforting when I think of how close we had been when we were younger, but how estranged he had become from constant fighting with my aunt. I don't know, thinking that makes it feel more special to me.

I believe its a pretty old home (old farmhouse like many in the area), but i think has been remodeled in the last 10 years. The way it is set up is that there is a kitchen near the front next to the dining room/living room. in the dining/living area there are stairs to the 2nd floor where you can look over and see the living area. 

Let me get to the point, on several occasions i have heard this crying. I am typically in the kitchen, or the living room. Sometimes it happens when the kids are downstairs and playing (grade school age and 9 months), other times it will happen when the baby is down. She uses this baby monitor where the image on the screen is that of the crib. Like a webcam set up to show the crib, but not really. Not sure how to explain it. Anyway so i know its not the baby(if shes down for a nap) when i hear the crying during that time. 

I tend to hear and see things when i get tired. Its the joy of being a college student. :) So i didn't mention it to my boss. This changed when we both heard it. She said that she'd been hearing it and thought it was just her. I told her i'd heard it also. 

I believe in ghost n' stuff, told her not to worry. We both believe in Jesus and I've never felt anything creepy going on there. 

Just kinda odd that's all. Would like to know your guy's thoughts. If you have any questions please feel free to ask and if your going to call bullshit, go for it. I'm not going to fight about it.

First off, a little backstory. I've always been scared shitless about the whole ""turn my head and see something that shouldn't be there"" thing. When I was younger, I would run up the basement stairs at top speed to avoid seeing some terrifying thing that I wouldn't want to, or out the bathroom window, in the mirror, etc. Normal stuff.
It was a couple months ago that this happened. I was reading to the point of drunken sleeplessness, and passed out in my boxers, uncovered, on my girlfriend's bed. Usually, I never fall asleep without the covers on because I still get that weird feeling that hands might rise from under the bed and grab me or something. You get the idea.
Anyways, I wake up (not really) in bed, but the room which is usually well lit, is darker. I remember being unable to move, but my range of vision roamed freely. I suddenly get this overwhelming feeling that something is in the closet. The closet is ALWAYS open, and I'd never wished harder that it was shut. The feeling turns into a knowing, and I am positive that there is something, a woman in particular, in the closet. I try my hardest not to look, but for some reason, I do, and I see this woman's distraught face staring at me from the closet door. My vision shifts back to where my head is facing, and I try to pull the covers over me, but my entire body is paralyzed. I feel the woman, or entity, or whatever, moving from the closet, across the room, and under the bed. I close my eyes and try to yell, but my voice makes no sound. The fear was something I had never known before. Now I'm struggling as hard as I can to make noise or move, but nothing happens. I can feel the presence of the woman right in front of my face, but I refuse to open my eyes. The thing that woke me up, which will be burned into my memory forever, was the sound of a woman's voice, as if she were whispering directly into my ear. ""Gene,"" she said. And I woke up.
I shook my girlfriend to tell her what happened, and as soon as I snapped out of it, I was sure that I had just experienced something evil.
I did some research on sleep paralysis, and it's the closest I can come to any sort of explanation. A couple things to note are: 
1. I never felt a weight on my body. The entire time I felt like my body just lacked the energy to move at all. Paralysis really is the best description I have for it.
2. The name ""Gene"" doesn't really hold any meaning to me. Neither does ""Jean"", and I'm not sure why it stuck out to me so much.
3. The entire time that this was happening, I had NO grip on reality. As far as I was concerned, what was happening was real life.
4. I hadn't taken any drugs or had anything to drink before hand.

That's about it. If anyone has any insight or questions, let me know. It was honestly the most terrifying experience I've ever been through in my life. I haven't told too many people about it other than my girlfriend and mother, but the affect it had on me made me feel like I needed to write it out somewhere. And then I found this subreddit!

        When I was six, my dad drowned in a kayaking accident. He was on his new favorite (and hardest) river. He had just gone down a set of waterfalls and thought he found an eddie to rest in. 
    As he paddled, the current was too strong and pulled him downriver. He flipped his kayak and was caught between two rocks. He drowned in three minutes... 
    He never told anyone where he was. All I knew was dad hadn't come home in a long time. He was the CEO of a pop-tart plant so he normally came home late. But this was different. Mom would just zone everything out. But she'd leave us with a babysitter every day for two weeks. She never told my sister and I that she was with a search party looking for his body. 
    They found him eventually. The only things that were recovered from the water were his kayak, paddle, Auburn gold class ring splash skirt and his body. I now own all of his kayaking equipment. But the night I put his class ring on my desk, everything got weird.
    There was a sense of peace in the house again. A few nights went by and one night, at about 3:00a.m, I woke up. I remember feeling oddly cold under all my blankets and strangely awake. I got up to get water and once I turned around from the faucet, there he was. He looked, as I described, ""cloudy"" and he started crying when I told him I missed him. 
    The overwhelming urge to cry came over me at that same time. He told me that it was Really hard to do this. To be here this long. He wanted to see mom so I hugged him and held his hand. He felt cold, like electricity almost. But had the texture of paper. We walked into her room and I woke her up. 
    She looked horrified. But dad just whispered how much he loved her through all the fights and how he knows she's sad but needs to take care of us. I cried again. My sister never woke up through any of this and doesn't remember when dad kissed her that night. 
    My sister and I went through months of therapy to understand what death was and how to recover from it all. I had to take care of my family for a while at the age of six because mom has Severe depression. 
    But I remember it all. Maybe it's not healthy but I find comfort in him being here. I'm sorry the story was kind of lengthy and not scary. But this is a place to share your encounters with the other side. And I suffer from the same depression and it makes me feel better to tell someone about all this.

1351643705.0,12,self.Thetruthishere,12dd86,[fam]/[me] The Hamlin House,Craigglesofdoom,14,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/12dd86/famme_the_hamlin_house/,"When I was eight, we moved from Puerto Rico to Maine when my Dad retired from the Navy. My parents had bought a parcel of 550 acres on a mountain in Maine in 1980 as an investment, and we decided to build a home on it. the land had been farmed in the 1800s, but had grown up since then - stone walls and stone cellar holes abounded. 

The land had an abandoned old house on it. It wasn't TECHNICALLY on our land, but it was about a hundred feet over the road that was the parcel border, so it was basically on our land. Some digging into the town records revealed that the family that had lived there were the Hamlins, and they had moved away sometime in the 60's or 70's and abandoned the house. The first time we visited the house, I instantly had a weird feeling about it, like something about it didn't fit in. But, it was an old house in the middle of the woods, slowly falling apart and getting pulled into the surroundings by trees and shrubs and moss and mold, so it made sense. My dad and I explored the house completely one day, from top to bottom, every room. I remember it vividly. It wasn't terrifying, but rather enthralling in a horror-movie kind of way. We'd dare each other to open the next door, bet that we wouldn't look around the next corner. The house wasn't big at all, but it had more rooms than any other house I know, many of them tiny, almost closet sized. The Hamlins had left a lot of their stuff behind, from furniture to clothes to dishes, which definitely added to the creepiness of the house. The attic and the basement were the scariest places, per usual. The attic had only a trapdoor entrance, and only a boarded-up window, so we couldn't see anything, but I swear I could hear breathing - I chalked that up to an animal sleeping of some sort. The basement was where it got good. [I'm getting chills just writing this]

Going down the stairs to the basement was horrifying as it was. There was barely enough light to see by, illuminated only by the windows around the ceiling, and every step on the staircase creaked as if it were going to buckle beneath us. The basement floor was dirt - and a plethora of mushrooms were growing in the faint, dirty light. The basement was nearly empty, save for a pile of tools in a corner, a shelf on which a bunch of empty jars sat, and then the worst part: A wooden headstone in the corner. The shape was unmistakeable - a semicircle cut at the top, standing about three feet tall and clearly implanted deeply into the soil. My dad and I did the ""I dare you to"" thing again and in the longest ten seconds of my life, slowly walked over to the headstone (headboard?) The soil was compacted just as much as the rest of the basement, but every second I swore that a hand would pop up and grab us both. On the headboard was carved ""Here Lies"" and underneath that...nothing. Absolutely nothing. As we walked back up the stairs and out of the house we speculated that maybe it was something a kid had put up for Halloween or something...Who knows? We didn't think much of it.

Cut to: eleven years later, I'm in college, brought a couple friends home to Maine.
We go up to the Hamlin House because it's Halloween time and why not? It's creepy. I already told them the story about the grave.
While we're walking, my mom and dad tell us about them exploring the house the past summer.
Dad:""Oh, you'll love this. We were in the kitchen seeing if any of the plates were worth taking...and you know how the bedroom was right above the kitchen? The one that still had the bed in it? Well, something GOT UP OUT OF THE BED.""
Me: ""WHAT.""
Mom: ""Yeah! It was the weirdest thing! It was just like something getting out of bed. Metal creak, two feet going clomp clomp, then another creak as it stood up.""
Dad: ""And then it walked over to the stairs and started walking down...""
Me: ""Well what was it!?"" (my friends are pretty freaked out at how nonchalant this conversation is)
Dad: ""I dunno, we got out of there.""
Mom: ""Yeah, it was too scary.""
Dad: ""It wasn't scary, I just didn't want it to be some crazy squatter or something.""
Mom: ""Oh get out, you had the truck started before I was even out the front door.""
Anyway, we got to the house, and it is RIPPED apart. Roof is caving in, front door is off its hinges, and ALL the windows are broken.
Me: ""Wow, it hasn't aged well.""
Dad: ""Whoa, someone - something - went to town on this.""
Mom: ""Yeah, it was still in good condition last time we were here. It looks like fifty years have gone by, this is bizarre.""
My friends are legitimately scared at this point. I'm thinking that's what I get for bringing Noo Yawkahs into the woods of Maine, but then, right on fucking cue, there is a bona fide blood-curdling SCREAM from inside the house. I actually (not figuratively, or literally) pissed my pants. My bladder actually let fly with a gush of everything it had to lighten my load for the all-out sprint back to my house. This scream was worse than anything in any horror movie, it wasn't an owl, or any other kind of animal. It was straight from the bowels of hell. Every one of the five of us went on 100% animal instinct at that point and hightailed it back down the road. We didn't stop until we were back in the living room of my house, a good three-quarter-mile run for sure.

All our reactions after that were kind of ""Well...haha. What do you think that was?"" Followed by shrugs and uneasy looks. We all took showers in turns (it was obviously necessary for me and at least one of my friends) My dad finally broke the silence by opening the fridge and breaking out a sixer of beer, and then we had a barbecue. But seriously, that was the SCARIEST experience of my life. My parents and I have not been back near the house since then, and quite honestly, I don't think I want to. It can rot into the ground for all I care.

**tl;dr Old abandoned house in my woods in Maine had a grave in the basement, and my parents disturbed the spirit's posessions, and it was unhappy at a further advance.**

**Edit I forgot about** There's a revolutionary-era graveyard on the other side of the road from the Hamlin House. Two graves are from the 1760s, one from 1770 something, two from the 1790s, and then a few more from the early 1800s.

[true stories of mine and my family's],iseespirits,18,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ypoce/spirits_can_communicate_with_me_in_my_dreams_true/,"let me begin with a little bit of background information about me. i've always been a believer of spirits, ghosts, god, the devil, angels, demons...everything like that, even before i ever had my own experiences with the paranormal.


my mom always thought i was a bit special in the way that i could sense certain things, good or bad that were around me. it seems to be a common trait of the women from my mom's side of the family; myself, my mom (not as strongly as the others), my aunt, and my grandmother. as far as i know, my mom hasn't experienced much of anything paranormal. she's just a bit on the religious side and also believes in paranomal things. my aunt on the other hand, has a crazy history with the paranormal.


our family lives in northern north carolina. i've lived in the same city my entire life. when my aunt was pretty young, around probably 23 years old, she moved into her first house (1985-1986). it wasn't long after she moved in she found out it was infested with demons. violent demons to be exact. they would rip and tear things off the walls, open the kitchen cabinets and throw glass dishes at her or just shatter them on the floor. needless to say, the house was up for rent soon after. she didn't know how to get rid of them, or i'm sure she would have tried. as soon as someone else moved in she told herself she was going to go back and warn the new people who lived there. when that day came, she went to the house and knocked on the door. two older men (huge, muscular, beards) moved in. she warned them about the demons who lived in the house with them. they blew her off, saying something like, ""we don't believe in that shit, get away from our house you crazy bitch."" she left. not two weeks later they moved out.


about 4-5 years later, my aunt married and moved to another house not even 3 miles away from her old house. mistake? not really...this house didn't have violent demons inside, but it definitely had ghosts. they wouldn't cause any harm, but they would show themselves to you if you caught them at the right moment. going to visit her house when i was little (4-10 years old) always gave me the creeps. it had a cold feeling when you walked in, and just gave you an odd creepy feeling. not to mention the house was around 100 years old. brick with some parts painted white, half the paint chipped off of course. it had an attic and a basement, which always scared the shit out of me just looking at the doors. if you opened the attic door, it had the most narrow stairwell with very steep steps leading to the top, and you couldn't see far up because it was so dark up there. i never wanted to know what was up there. same with the basement...i'm getting creeped out remembering it. both my aunt and my cousin have reported seeing spirits in the house and luckily i never did, i probably wouldn't have went back without my mom. since then, she divorced and moved out of the house. occasionally i still drive past her old street and within the past 3 or 4 years, they tore down the house and built a new one on top of it. i wonder if it's still haunted.


my grandmother on the other hand is able to see spirits as well. it's mainly her mother she sees, she also says she can literally feel her around sometimes. she hasn't told me very many stories, but this is one i can recall. my great grandmother died right before i was born (1991) so she never got to see me and i never met her. my grandmother traveled to north carolina from new york to be at my baptism. everyone was sitting at the church, and she said she felt a tap on her shoulder and she heard my great grandmother speaking to her. ""i knew you would be here."" she said to my great grandmother.


as for me, i've had a few experiences myself. some good, some bad.


i've never been super close to my dad. he traveled a lot for work when i was young, not saying that's his fault, but it did shape how i grew up and how well i knew him. my parent's marriage was never the best either. they weren't happy, but they stayed together for the sake of me and my brother (we were young kids.) eventually alcohol and mildly abusive behavior on his part made it worse. til this day he has not changed. i was always closer to my mom. the only person i was close to on my dad's side of the family was my grandma. 


i loved spending time with her, my mom says i was one of her most favorite people. i have so many great memories of her and spending a lot of my childhood at her house. let's fast forward a bit. in 2000 she was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 65 in both breasts. she had her breasts removed but that didn't stop the cancer from spreading. she died in 2001. i was really tore up over the whole thing. the last thing she ever told me was she loved me. 


years and years went by, and i was never expecting to see her again. until one night.


paranormal or not, i have a history of pretty crazy and intense dreams. i'm not an expert on the subject, or know if there's a name for what i'm experiencing; but my dreams can be VERY real, so real sometimes to the point in the dream i think i'm actually awake and there. sometimes i have dreams where i can actually feel being touched by someone else in the dream. i have also had a couple lucid dreams before.


my grandma came to me in a dream about 3 years ago. back in the old days my dad's side of the family would gather at her house, have cookouts and swim in the backyard inground pool and just have a good time. my dream went something like that...only not in so much detail. in my dream our whole entire family was back together again in the backyard, and in my dream i was shocked to see my grandma because i knew she had died. she was standing right in front of me, and she gave me a hug. i don't remember if she said anything to me because it's been awhile since i had this dream. it was so real, i knew it was her. the moment she hugged me i woke up from my dream, feeling a ton of pressure on my body like i was being squeezed. i began to cry a little bit. i said ""mee mee [that's what all the grandkids called her], if that's you, touch my foot."" it was sticking out of the blanket. sure enough, my foot felt a tingly feeling, similar to like as if my foot was falling asleep.



now why i thought to write this post; because my grandma just came back to my dream two nights ago. i'm almost 21 years old now, and i'm also 7 months pregnant with my first baby (another girl, by the way.) it would be her very first grandchild. in the dream, i went back to her old house again. everything looked and smelled just the same. i walked through the door and into her living room to see her sitting right there in the same old chairs she always used to have in that house. i was surprised and shocked to see her in this dream too, because i still knew she died. she hugged me again, saying something like, ""it's great to see you after so long."" i was pregnant in the dream too like in waking life. she touched my stomach and told me how bad she wanted to feel the baby move. i told her little stories about the baby and how just a few hours ago (before i went to bed) my boyfriend had his hand on my stomach and felt our daughter stretching inside me. i told her about an event that only happened hours ago in my dream! this made her happy, she stood there smiling and laughing and then simply disappeared.


i woke up extremely happy, and touched. i couldn't believe she came again, so unexpected. it was an amazing feeling and experience. i told my boyfriend the story, and he feels comforted knowing how much she cares and feels as if she is protecting us all in some way. my pregnancy has been extremely perfect, no complications, our daughter is growing completely normally, and not to mention i haven't had much pain at all (except for lower back pain some days and achy feet and ankles.) 


the next evening i wrote a note for her and left it at her grave. i thanked her for coming to see me in my dream, caring about me and my daugher and being one of our guardian angels. that very SAME night, a demon came into my dream and scared me to death.


it was a woman demon with dark brown hair and completely black eyes, similar to [this.](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb58378/supernatural/images/8/89/Demon2MTM.jpg) it was basically there to show me how it could OR wanted to hurt me and my daughter. in the dream i was screaming and it very forcefully kicked me in my stomach. that's where i woke up scared and sweating. still in my half asleep state i was scared it truly happened. i felt my daughter kicking though, and i was SO relieved. i went back to sleep and it never came back.


what do YOU think about all of this? (my stories). i just don't understand why that evil spirit would come into my dream and do that. is there a name for people who can communicate with spirits in their dreams? i barely know anything about things like this, if you could educate me a little bit also, i would appreciate that! thanks for reading, i know it was a long one.

When I was 13 I was hanging out with my friends one afternoon, and since my stepsister was being horrible to me that day I suggested we have a sleepover. 

My friend Letisha offered to have it at her house, but Joann said she had family staying so couldn't make it. I felt like Letisha's family was a bit strange so didn't like going there, but I couldn't really back out now so agreed to stay over.

On the walk over to her house my stomach started to hurt. I felt cold, sweaty, shaky and faint, and felt worse and worse the closer we got to her house. I felt really strongly that I should turn and run home, but my manners got in the way. 

When we got there I had to spend some time in the toilet, which I've noticed as an adult is something that happens to me when I'm nervous. It was definitely unusual for me then though.

Anyway I don't remember much of what we did, but that night I was laying in her spare bed in her room, looking at the street light out the window and thinking that I should have stayed home. I rolled over to face the door, and in the corner to the right of the door was a massive black mass. It was nearly as tall as the roof, and it's really hard to describe but it was like a pillar of darkness, it was solid in the centre but sort of faded out, I guess kind of like a cloud but black. 

I blinked a few times, then rolled over to stare out the window again. When I rolled back over shortly after it was gone.

A couple of years later my stepsister had a friend staying over, and we were sitting around telling ghost stories. She told me that she used to live in that house before my friend did, and her and her sisters used to hold seances and various other silly things that teenage girls do, and she was convinced that they had let a demon or something similar into the house. 

I freaked out and told her what I'd seen when I stayed there, and she said that's the least of what they used to see. At this point though my younger stepcousin got really freaked and asked her to stop, and I never got another opportunity to talk to her more about it.

When I was 16, I had a belief in the paranormal. My family is religious, so I am well versed in the Bible and other religious texts, concepts of good and evil, etc. In some ways I look back and realize I had colored this experience in that regard. However, even looking at it skeptically now I can't debunk what happened. I bore the mark of that night for three years.

It was an August night before my Junior year of high school. The weather that night was particularly bad. High winds and heavy rain bordering on hail made falling asleep difficult. My nerves were already on edge as I listened to the branches from a tree slapping the siding behind my head. As I listened, it grew worse. Severely worse. It began to sound like something was trying to claw its way into the room through the aluminum siding.

I'm not sure if my imagination was getting the best of me. Looking back, I think the mood might have amplified the emotional energy. There was a definite moment when the whole feeling shifted from annoyance, nervousness, and admittedly a touch of fear from the whole situation, to something more tense and darker. The temperature in the room suddenly dropped about ten degrees. I tensed up, and over the sound of the wind the rain, and the tree, I heard something that drove the fear home.

It was a laugh.

It sounded like it was outside my window. It was deep and mocking. My childhood instincts kicked in, and I pulled the blanket tighter and shut my eyes tight. Minutes passed, but I didn't hear it again. Maybe I *had* imagined it. Then I heard a sound that freaked me out even more.

I had a blue, plush rocker chair in my room from the time I was 12 until I left for college. It sat at the foot of my bed between the door out and the closet. I loved that chair. It was my inspiration spot. I sat in that chair for hours, playing guitar, reading, writing, etc. Now, I heard my chair, the unmistakable sound of it rocking slowly back and forth. I didn't want to look, but I couldn't help it. I glanced down.

In my chair, I saw what looked like the outline of a person. As I watched, the chair rocked back and forth. I wasn't certain what was going on. 

When I was three, I saw a heavy book move on its own from one side of a book shelf to the other side of the shelf, about 12"". I remember watching that with mild interest. This was freaking me the hell out.

A few seconds passed while I stared. Then I heard it again, that gut-wrenching laugh. This time, it was louder and came from the chair.

I had been formulating a plan in my head, and when I heard the laugh again, it was my final NOOOOOPE moment. In my right hand, I had knotted up my blanket. I rolled off the bed, standing in the same motion. I kept a Bible on my nightstand, which I picked up in my left hand. Normally I respect religious text (of all faiths), but as I dove for the door, I tossed my Bible at the chair like a holy hand grenade. As the book made contact with the chair, I heard a hissing noise like water dripping on a hot stove.

Door opened, I walked the five feet to my parent's bedroom door. I quickly walked in. They were both asleep. As I walked to the other side of their bed, I dropped to the ground and covered myself with my blanket. I don't know why, but I finally felt safe. But I wasn't.

As I settled in to try and finally sleep, I heard yet another noise that brought more horror. The floor outside my room let out a single, ominous creak.

Then another.

As I listened, I heard the creaking of the floor slowly getting closer and closer. It was in the hall, then in the doorway, then in the room. It made its way around the bed. I cringed. I could feel something ominous looming over me. Then something grabbed my leg.

Since that night, I have felt gentle touches or pushes from unseen sources. Some of those made me jump, some were comforting. This time, it was painful.

The touch burned. It was like someone had rubbed acid on their hand and then grasped my calf. I could feel each individual finger. The invisible hand pulled on my leg, as if the arm it belonged to was sinking into the floor, trying to drag me with it. As the pressure increased, the pain suddenly flared. I remember letting out a strained whimper, gritting my teeth, and then I think I passed out because everything went black.

I don't remember any dreams. I woke up around 8:30 the next morning, fairly stiff from sleeping on the floor with no pillow. I wanted to believe it had all been imagined, so I checked my leg. There was nothing there, and I actually felt relieved. I went about my day as normal, working on chores, joking with my sister, and whatever else. I remember that after I made my bed, I laid down on it and looked at the plush chair. The plush had a knap to it, so if you ran your hand over it, you could get the fuzz to ""stand up"" and make the fabric darker. My theory was that I had imagined the figure in the chair by ""matrixing"" those patterns in the fabric. Unfortunately, there was no pattern to be seen.

Later in the afternoon, I felt my leg begin to burn, in the same place I had been grabbed. It didn't feel the same, it was less intense and felt more generalized. I rolled up my pant leg and realized that what I had experienced wasn't a hallucination.

On my right calf, clearly visible, was a hand print. It was a bright red, like a bad sunburn. Four fingers could be seen, but the thumb was absent. I gingerly touched it, and it was tender like a burn.

I spent some time that afternoon praying and blessing my room. Whatever it was had seemed to enter through there. Nothing about the room seemed to change, but it did begin to feel ""safer."" That night before bed, I checked my leg again. The burn mark was still there, although it was less red. The new development was two small bumps. They looked almost like warts, although I've had one before on my arm and these were different. The tips were pointed, sort of like a zit, but these were just hardened skin. They didn't hurt, in fact I really didn't feel anything when I touched them. The two points/bumps had grown where the tips of the index and middle fingers were on the hand.

That night, the wind and the rain came back. At one point, I thought I heard it again, that laugh, outside the window. It didn't come back in, though. In fact, I never heard it again after that.

The odd part then was the bumps. The burn-looking mark faded after a day or two, but the bumps stayed. About six months later, I sterilized a knife with flame and cut the bumps off. No blood, no real pain. And in another month, they were back. They stayed on my leg until I was 19 or 20. I don't know when they disappeared, I just remember washing my leg one day in the shower and realizing they were gone.

Sorry this is so long. I know now that there are probably some very logical explanations: hypnagogic hallucinations, psychosomatic injuries, odd coincidental skin abnormalities. The fact, however, is that these events were all true *to me.* I didn't have the training and experience I do today. I wish I would have taken pictures of my leg, gotten those weird bumps biopsied. Still, this stands out as one of the most negative and bizzare brushes with the paranormal that I've experienced.

BUT. I want to share my experience about this one time, when we were intentionally calling ghosts with some friends. Also good to mention, this won't be a scary story, no twist at the end ... just an experience.
We had a party at my brothers house, it was a small party with around 10 people. And one of them was really into paranormal stuff, she seemed to know everything there is to know about spirits, ghosts, stuff. Me and my brother thought it would be fun to convince her, to call some ghosts (we actually tried several times before that day but were never successful, she would always say that it was to risky and if anything goes wrong that a ghost might turn violent, messing with peoples lives there). This time was different, probably due to alcohol involved:) we weren't really drunk, but just the right amount to be happy and smiling and of course courages... So she agreed and explained some basic rules and tips like: 

-she is going to be the medium (not sure if that is the expression in english). What that means is that she is going to be the only one in communication (talking, asking questions, etc...).

- we are going to communicate via alphabetical letters arranged around a table in a circle and with a glass (a typical drinking glass) that was turned upside down and where each of us would put one finger on top of that glass. 

- under no circumstances should we ever remove our finger from the glass during the procedure. Unless it was told so by her, the medium. 

So it began. We would all sit around the table in put our fingers on the glass. I remember I was kind of smiling and thinking: ""this is rubbish, nothing is going to happen, unless someone is gonna push the glass with his own finger"". She then proceeded and asked out loud: ""is there anyone here? is anyone trying to connect with us ?, please show us by moving this glass"". Me still smiling thinking what I thought, but keeping it to myself. And I was right, nothing happened!!! At least at first. She then urged us to really focus on the glass and trying to keep a blank mind. She again asked at loud: ""Is there anyone here?"" Boys and girls, I ain't joking, the glass started of moving all around the table. I was really shocked, i mean how can that even be!? I was watching our fingers, trying to determine, who is the one that is pushing it. But with the speed that the glass moved from one side of the table to another ... it was just simply impossible that anyone of us was doing it (to clarify what I mean ... If you put a finger on something and try to move it, you can clearly see either the nail going white-ish because of the pressure or the whole finger kind of bend to the side you are trying to move the object). And all of us were barely touching the glass. I mean really just barely touching!!! 
So she then asked a few questions: how did you die, why are you here, any messages to us, ... And the spirit (or whatever it was) answered all of them, until the glass just stopped moving and we were free to release our fingers from the glass. At this time i started to question all my beliefs. To this day I do not know what happened. Were we really talking to a person from the other side, or was is all just a prank? And yet a have no logical explanation for either of the possibilities. 
Let me just mention that the walk at 4 am from my brothers house to my own (just a 100m walk) was really terrifying. Scared shitless. So thats my experience with ghosts.

I'm attending summer classes at my university, staying in the dorms,  and I was preparing for an exam one morning. My roommate had gotten up and gone to get breakfast in the dining hall and had been out for about five or ten minutes. I sat at my desk with my books and laptop, facing the doorway. I should say that the building was built in the 1930's, so it's not ancient but not exactly new, either. The doorknobs rattle loudly whenever someone turns them, which always leads to me trying to muffle them if my roommate is asleep so I don't wake her. On the morning in question, I heard the doorknob rattle and assumed that she'd forgotten her key or something, so I called out that the door was unlocked and she could come on in. The door opened but nobody was there. After a few seconds of realizing that she wasn't there (called her name, no answer), I got up and looked around. Nobody was out in the hallway and it was about 7:30 AM, so I don't think it was one of our friends who'd stopped by to chat and then went to someone else's room. 

I shrugged it off and went back to my desk with the doorway still in plain sight. Not ten seconds later, I looked up to see if anyone was going to come in and I saw the door close itself. The thing that creeps me out most is that I SAW the doorknob turn and I heard it rattle. It's not something that could be passed off as another sound because it's been such a bane this summer, always trying to keep it quiet and having it wake me up when she leaves in the morning. 

For whatever reason it didn't immediately strike me as strange and I went back to studying, but when my roommate came back about half an hour later I asked her if she'd forgotten her key or something. She said no, that she'd been at breakfast for all of that time. I've talked to all the people we know and they say they were either asleep, in their own rooms or eating breakfast and no one said they came by, seeing as neither of us are usually awake at that time (we each had early exams that changed our schedules that morning).

I don't think it was the wind or the box fan because neither would cause the door to open after it had been shut and I highly doubt the fan is powerful enough to make the doorknob rattle and turn while the door shuts. It legitimately looked as though the door was being opened and shut by another person.

I'm sure this will get asked, so here goes: I don't know of anyone who was said to have died here. They say the third floor of our building is haunted but I'm on a different floor and I've never heard anything more than just ""Oh, someone told me it was haunted."" I will say that there have been a few times where I felt as though I were being watched. They were all late nights and my roommate was out at a friend's place; the feeling that someone (or something) else was in the room with me was almost overwhelming and once I just up and left until she got back. It wasn't malicious-feeling, just an eerie feeling of being observed by someone/thing that I couldn't see.

I've had a few creepy incidents that I'll add, if that's okay. Shortly after my grandfather died, my mom was in the kitchen at home making cookies or something and she heard a loud noise right beside her head, like someone clapping directly near her ear. The rest of the family was upstairs and it really freaked her out, so she came up to ask if we'd been downstairs. When she got to my room, she asked me if I'd been to the kitchen recently and I said no. She hesitantly mentioned my grandpa (my dad's father) and said for some reason she thought of him. As she said this my bedroom lights flickered briefly. Granted, that could be explained by the heat coming on or going off, but it seemed like a strange coincidence. Another 'kitchen thing' happened about two months after that. I was unloading the dishwasher and stood up to feel like my head was full of static noise, like being between radio stations. It seemed like a specific spot in the kitchen because I could move away and it became faint, but if I moved back it got louder. Then as suddenly as it appeared, it went away.

One more weird thing that happened at our house... My sister and I have each separately experienced the feeling of having our bedsheets ""crawl"" up our legs. One holiday I was home from university and I slept in my old room. I woke up around 3:30 AM or so and I don't know what woke me up, but suddenly I felt the sheets that were formerly around my feet crawl up my legs. I was conscious and could move around, so I feel like it wasn't sleep paralysis. A year later my sister reported that this has happened to her at least twice and maybe more frequently and it scares her so much she sleeps with the lights on each night. I've never felt that our house was spooky in any way but this kind of scares me. My parents built the house and the land before that was just a hillside field, no old houses or anything.

I can't come up with a decent explanation for any of these things, but I wish I could. I'm glad I'm not sleeping alone in my dorm room this summer. Any thoughts on this stuff? I feel a bit crazy but I wanted to share it anyway. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_vwv3z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/vwv3z/door_opens_and_closes_by_itself_me/,

my english is not the best, im sorry if i break some grammar/spelling rule.  

i had many experiences since the age of five, but this one in particular is a shared experience and has some extras that you may find interesting.


back when i was 18, i used to hang out on a pen and paper roleplaying club, and there there was a really cute girl, a little younger than me.  
everyone liked her, but no one dated her because they were scared of his family (not in a paranormal way); his father was a very protective retired soldier who was known to scare everyone who tried.

so, one day i started talking with her and we connected really fast. we spend all the day talking instead of playing, and we went for a coffee after. 
when we reallized the hour it was well past 22 and she lived about 1 hour form there on a bus, so i offered to go with her (on a bus, i had no car).
 
when we arribe she invited me in for some more coffee and i obviously accepted.
her parents were asleep upstairs, so we sit on a sofa on the living room and keep chatting for a while, and suddenly we were making out (yay!).

well, we are in the middle of it and i notice that there is a guy sitting on a chair behind her. not a shade, not a shadow, a guy.  
about 60 years old, olive green sweater, brown pants. just sitting there and watching us.

""fuck me, his dad"" is the first i thought. i whispered to her ""your father is watching us"".
she turned around, first to the stairs, then behind her (where he was) and turned back to me and resumed kissing me after saying ""there is no one there"".
i was still seeing him sitting there. i never ceased to see him.
""uh... yes there is""
now she stopped, turned around again, asked me ""where"".

""right there on the chair""

she looked at me for a moment like thinking and once more ""there is no one there"".

now im thinking that im getting pranked badly by her and his dad.   
""right there on the chair, wearing a sweater and brown pants"" i said kind of annoyed.  
she looked at me for a second and opened his eyes widely, like suprised and scared at the same time.  

""MOOOM"" she screamed from the top of her lungs and scared the shit out of me.   
now i dont see the guy anymore.

his mom AND his dad ran downstairs on their underwear asking what happened and pretty much looking at me with that ""WTF did you just did to my daugther mother f..."" face while i was there with my ""deer in the headlights"" face. 

""tell my mother what you just saw"" she told me and so i did.  
i told her mother how the guy looked like...and she interrupted me and finished my description.

the things calmed down, the father went back to sleep, her mother got herself a robe (the hotel thingy, cant seem to find the right word) and got us more coffee. 

we started to talk, she told me that she saw that ""guy"" on a daily base and other things. we were pretty open about it and i pretty much spelt my guts about everything i ever saw (and that is quite a lot i must say).
turned out that her was just like me, his older daugther (not the one i was dating) and son too and his husband could ""sense them"" but not actually see them. his middle and minor daughters could not.
we talked for hours, even after my friend went to sleep.

i became pretty much a part of the family, dated my ((ex(girl))friend for about a year and even after that didnt work her parents still consider me like his stepson.   
it has been more than 10 years now and im still invited for a coffee now and then.

back then i was scared about the things i see and never talked to anyone thinking that i may have some sort of psicological disorder, but now i know better.  
there are tons of ""sightings"" that can be explained, but there are others that cant. i choose this one in particular to tell because is one of them.

1337281833.0,12,self.Thetruthishere,ts2kh,A shudder and boom.,butterfliesfade,18,6,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ts2kh/a_shudder_and_boom/,"I used to live in this grand new two-story house in a suburbia neighborhood with quiet neighbors and a calm atmosphere. Nothing out of the ordinary never really happened. But I remember while being there, there was always a sense that a pair of footsteps were right behind you at night.

I was at least fourteen or fifteen when I lived there. My room was on the second floor, and it had a window overlooking the backyard. There was always something strange about my room. I could never put a finger on it or figure it out. Whenever it was winter, my room would be the hottest in the house, it was like at least 90F. You would instantly notice because the rest of house had a normal constant temperature and when you entered my room, there was an immediate change. I always told my parents and they could never figure out why my room was this way. The same happened for the summertime, my room would be a chilling 60F degrees and no one could figure out why. We even had a air-conditioner technican come down to take a look at it. And no one could figure out why, it was always a mystery to me.

That's not even it either. Laying in bed and trying to go to sleep at night was the hardest for me to do. There was always a nagging feeling that I had a heavy chest and countless anxiety. I couldn't look at the foot of my bed or even at my closet. Just this feeling always bothered me like someone or some people were standing there, staring at me and waiting for me to notice that they were there. 

Because of the window, I was able to get strong moonlight beaming into my room that causes shadows. I could get the sense that sometimes there was a tall shadow at the foot of my bed, hovering over me, and locked onto me. It felt like it was a tall man, and it looked like he had bowler hat. I knew something was there because I would resort staring to the ceiling to focus and calm down, but that never worked for me. Every single time I looked over to the foot of my bed, there was nothing there. I knew my eyes weren't playing tricks on me, because I would feel the air change, and I felt cold wind against my face when my room was utterly hot. That's how I knew. It always felt like a soft hand swipping against my cheek, and all I could do was close my eyes.

It was a brilliant and sunny day, and I remember completely alone at my house. It was mid-afternoon and my dad had left for work at his airline job. My house had an eerie feeling when it was empty and you were the only person there. Even my cat nor my dog made a noise. It was so quiet that I blared music to get rid of anything I wouldn't want to hear.

I was upstairs in the game room, and sitting on my computer chair, on my desktop browsing youtube videos to listen to music. I didn't think anything of any little sounds I heard because I just guessed it was my cat or dog. After a while of being home alone for an hour or two, it was probably around four o'clock in the afternoon. As I paused a youtube video, I heard a weird slam. As if someone had opened my front door and slammed it. There was always this weird way you had to close my front door because it got stuck half-way while closing it. You basically had to slam it in order to close it. I knew I had the locked the door when my dad left and I knew the door had been closed for a while. How could it be possible for someone to open my lock-bolted door, when I had to have heard that heavy creak and then slam it?

My heart-rate shook up and my anxiety tumbled to the ceiling. So many thoughts run through your head when that happens, it's like am I being robbed? Is my sister home? My dad came home for something? It was neither of all those things, very much neither.

Getting up from the computer chair, I took very cautious steps towards my stairs and bit my tongue down. My stairs were a straight go up and come back down type of stairs. There was no swivel or curve, it was like an escalator formation except it didn't move.  

My whole body was filling up with some sort of andrealine, and nervousness all at once. My mind was jumping to so many conclusions, it was hard to keep calm. My pets didn't make any noise, my dog didn't sit up so I didn't hear his collar jinkle or my cat didn't meow. 

When I took one more step towards the top of my stairs to go down, my whole body went into panic. I heard a loud boom, a bang of some sort. It was a gunshot, it sounded like it and I was pretty convinced it was. My heart groaned against my chest, dire for some sort of escape. I even shook myself because I didn't know if I could think anymore. I have never heard a gunshot before but I was sure it was, and my neighborhood was a good one I don't think they could of been a shooting. Then a loud frantic crying and moaning came out of nowhere it was like someone was right next to me doing this. It lasted for about a few ten seconds, but it was chilling. It sounded like a lady, a damsel in terrible distress. A sense of hopefulness and despair washed over me, it was as if she could envelope me with her emotions. I could feel the breath of something on the back of my ear. My eyes narrowed from side to side back and forth. My whole existence went numb as I didn't know what to think. 

I didn't know what to do, think, or see. I instantly bolted into my bedroom and shut the door, forgetting everything else outside of it.

The only thing I can piece together is that the man with the bowler hat that watched me at night killed this woman with a gunshot. The woman was pleading at me to protect her that's why she was standing beside me. I'm not able to research the land or know how to but I do know what I experienced was real. My parents don't believe me but some of my friends do because they have been at my old house.

I try and look at everything from a skeptical, yet open-minded point of view. However, of all the ghost stories I have heard from friends and family, and everything strange I have encountered myself, this is the only one I have difficulty coming up with a rational explanation for.

Back when I was about 12 - 13 (I'm 29 now), my Nan moved into a block of flats for the elderly. Now, at the time, my Nan was quite healthy, and of sound mind, so she would only stay there at night, and would spend the days at my mothers house, which was only a couple of streets away.

During these times, I would occasionally go and stay at her flat in the daytimes, to read, watch TV, or take my games console, where I could enjoy the peace and quiet. However, I always got a strange feeling from the flat, although I'm not sure if this is simply from years of watching horror films and reading books on the paranormal.

However, one night, I went to visit my nan at her flat. Now, both her and my mum had been at the flat all evening, having a little bit of a drink, and listening to old records and chatting about everything. When I got there, the flat was a little untidy. Records had been scattered around the record player, some peanuts had been spilt on the table, and some blankets were on the sofa, where my mum had been planning on staying over that night. However, my mum decided to go home, and I chose to stay. Instead of sleeping on the sofa, I slept on the floor next to my nans bed. The flat did not have a bedroom as such, and instead the area where the bed were, was only separated from the living room by a curtain.

The next morning, I heard my nan get up at around 6am and go into the living room. I fell back asleep, but was awoken by my nan, who I could see, even in the low light (It was January, so it was still dark at that time) was pale and visibly scared.

My nan had gotten up and walked into the living room, and instead of switching on the main light, which would have woken me up, opened the passageway door, and switched on the light in there, giving her enough light to sit down and smoke a cigarette. It was at this point that she realized the the flat was suddenly tidy. The records had been stacked neatly, the peanuts had been put into the ashtray, and the blankets from the sofa were nowhere to be seen (I used separate blankets and had left those ones where they were). Shocked, my nan turned to the passageway, and saw an old lady stood there. My nan had not put her glasses on at this time, and her eyesight is really bad without them, but she says she could see the woman crystal clear. The woman smiled at her, then disappeared. It was straight after this that my nan woke me up.

Now, I know that the flat was untidy the night before, and I am sure that no-one had tidied up beforehand. I also know that my nan would not make up something like this, and I could see the shock on her face. The final straw came later that day. She was chatting to one of her neighbors when she described the encounter. The neighbor told her that the woman she had described sounded like the former resident who had died the previous year.

My nan moved out of the flat that very same day and never went back.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_tc7wr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tc7wr/mefam_the_former_resident/,

I grew up in a small town in Michigan, right next to a Native American Reservation. The town even has an old Indian School that has been turned into an insane asylum which I lived about 2 miles away from. 

Finding old relics of the Native American population was relatively common, but this event is something I cannot explain. I usually tell this story in two parts, not because I know they’re related, but because it was freaking weird and feels incomplete to leave out: 

In the middle of a beautiful spring day, I took my golden retriever out for a walk in the woods behind our house. We only walked for about 5 minutes when I saw shadows moving quickly in my periphery. 

I looked up to see a beautiful and large grey wolf lift its head to stare back at me not 50 yards away. Nervous, I slowly backed my distracted dog and I onto the main path, then booked it up a hill to walk along the edge of the woods back to our house. 

I had some adrenalin going at this point, but the neighbor’s house was 30 feet away so I wasn’t scared. I stopped. There was a noise. A very, out-of-place drumming noise. I’ve visited enough Powwows to know that beat; I’ve heard it called the “heartbeat of the earth” because it sounds like a drum following a quick, even heartbeat. 

I looked towards the neighbors’ house on the left to see if they were just listening to music, but the house seemed empty and the drum was loud and clearly coming from the woods to my right. The trees were still bare from the winter, so I could see behind bushes and down an empty slope of woods. My dog was dead-still with ears perked up listening too. 

Shaking it off, I took a step forward; the drums immediately stopped. “That's weird… well, I have to be sure…” I took a step backward and there were the drums again, just as loud as before. 
At this point my dog panicked and bolts, ripping the leash out of my hands and running for home, with me on his heels. 

The woods and town are known for spooky events. And the house we lived in was full of odd experiences; but never anything like this and I never heard anything like it since. Please tell me; what was that?

**Tl;dr: Took dog for a walk in formerly Native American woods, see wolf, leave post-haste, then hear Native drum beat that stops when you leave that one spot.**

The story is important for one of these additional stories, so you might want to [check it out here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/qy5qt/what_is_the_creepiest_most_inexplicable_thing/c41fiqz)

A lot of stuff happened in the firehouse over a two or three month time frame. When all of this stuff happened, my friends and I were 16-18 years old. I've forgotten some of the stuff, but here are a couple I remember.

1. Three of us were hanging out in the meeting room when we heard an old woman say ""Hello?"" three times. The first time she said it I thought it was the scanner, and laughed because I figured someone at dispatch was messing around. The second time she said it I walked closer to the scanner. The third time I was close enough to realize it was definitely not the scanner.

2. The meeting room had a pool table. My friend and I decided to have a 101 game tournament to decide who was the better player. We would play for an hour or two every day after school. One day, we finished playing and started walking out of the meeting room and into the garage. He hit the light switch near the door, but only half the lights went out. The other lights were controlled by a light switch on the wall halfway into the room. I walked back to turn off the lights, as we continued whatever conversation we were having. I stood near the switch as we continued to talk, when from the garage we heard a woman scream her head off. We ran out of the firehouse at full speed. That was one of the first things that I experienced, if not the first. 

3. There was a woman at the firehouse that hated me and my friends because we were young and hung out there a lot. She would have been a great arch-nemesis, if she wasn't such an idiot. Anyway, she used to stop by the firehouse often. Not as much as we did, but a few times a week. A couple of us used to joke that we should hide our cars, and then hide in the firehouse and scare the shit out of her. 
One day I went to the firehouse with a friend who wasn't a firefighter. As we were walking toward the building, we both saw someone in a white hat run by one of the windows. We both stopped in our tracks. I started laughing and told her that someone's trying to mess with us. Before going into the building, I ran around to the back of the firehouse to see if that's where the other guys parked their cars. No cars were there. We walked into the garage and looked everywhere. I was on my toes the entire time, waiting for someone to jump out at me and try to scare me. It was an hour before I let me guard down. No one was in the place.

4. *A lot* of shit happened in this place. It used to take me up to 45 minutes to go through all of the shit that happened when telling someone else. Near the back of the garage was a supply closet that was locked. We used to hang out near there and smoke cigarettes when in the firehouse. Two brothers from a different fire company were hanging out with me and someone else one night, and we told them all of the shit that happened. When we got to the end of the story, you can tell neither of them believed us. One, who laughed at most of what we said, started walking toward the front of the garage. The other was sitting on the back of one of the trucks. As I continued to say, ""I swear this is true,"" or something along those lines, a loud noise came from the locked closet. The walking dude stopped dead in his tracks, the guy on the truck turned white, and I jumped up yelling, ""I told you mother fuckers!"" Since we were there all of the time, we knew where they hid the keys to closets. We grabbed the key, opened the door, and found everything sitting up shelves, just like it always is.

I'm sorry this was so long. You're lucky I don't recall too many more right now. Though there is one more story:

On the other side of the locked supply closet was a small room where we kept a bunch of tools. There were 7 or 8 of us hanging out near there one night. As in story 4, we heard a noise come from the room. Someone tried to open the door. It opened about a quarter of the way and then stopped, kind of like someone pushed back on it. We took off running. As I got near the front of the garage, I looked over my shoulder and saw my one friend in the Karate Kid crane position. He looked over his shoulder, realized he was by himself and then ran away. 

After we stopped laughing about it we went back to the door, opening it slowly. A mop had fallen and lodged itself behind the door. It only appeared that the door was pushed back because the first guy opened the door quickly. Not so ghostly, but it was funny.

A sudden death in the family distracted me from my mod duties. I was mostly experimenting with the layout and not the colors, and I threw in some saturated colors to help me differentiate the colors so I could go back and change them later. 

I take all your feedback very seriously. I hope that I am on the right track with this new scheme. My main goals are keeping a foreboding atmosphere, but not having dark background with light text (as I received many PMs about how it hurts the eyes.)  There are obviously problems that remain:

* The links 
 * The ""self/thetruthishere"" is too light. 
 * No variation between read and unread links.
 * Issues with links within the self posts are difficult to differentiate from the main text, etc. I would like them to be a nice deep blue similar to the tree trunks in the bg image. 
* A few reminders of the terrible colors remain, but shall be fixed as i navigate the site a little more and check the site on other browsers, resolutions, and screen types. Just by typing this message I've noticed a few irritating problems that shall be fixed soon. 
* A few weird CSS issues that need tweaking, especially with RES users.
* Font color issues. 
 * Some remain black and illegible, header text a terrible blue that hurts against this green.
* Subscribe and Unsubscribe buttons-clashes with current theme.
* I'd like a 1 inch margin on the front page between the header and the first link so some of the trees will show at the top. 

I'm going out of town to spread ashes in an old Native American graveyard. If anyone would like to adjust the problems that remain for instant gratification, particularly for RES users and RES tweaks,  feel free to PM ShittyContributor. Otherwise, thank you for being patient as I slowly make this a less painful experience.


Out of curiosity, would anyone like to make an image for the site to go under the ""search reddit"" bar? Would anyone like to make custom Up and Down vote arrows or have any ideas? I'd like to get rid of the orange and blue.

1329786761.0,12,self.Thetruthishere,pym6t,[ME] Hometown Stories Part 1: The Girl at the Beach [X-POST from /r/nosleep],Jables19,21,9,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/pym6t/me_hometown_stories_part_1_the_girl_at_the_beach/,"When you live in a small town and you are under 21 like I was in this story, you are willing to do anything to kill the boredom. Before that night, I thought we were lucky to have a beach in town. Even if it was only open for a short time during the year it was even more fun at night time.

Centennial Beach was less a beach than it was a small sandy area on the border of Lake Williams. To get there you had to drive into an area of town called Fort Meadow. It was a nice neighborhood away from the general shadiness of the rest of the town. As often as we had the idea to go to the beach late at night the execution could be a little tricky.

The parking lot was closed off after about 6:00 p.m. in the summer so you couldn't just drive down into the parking lot. You had to park down the road so passing police wouldn't see several cars parked at the entrance. Then you had to walk in the dark, flanked on both sides by trees that had a habit of rustling as we passed. You would cross the parking lot and walk through trees that anyone could hide behind and eventually the trees cleared and you hit the sandy coast line of the lake.

I tell you this to give you a sense of the isolation we felt when we hung out there. We would swim, bring some drinks, whatever we wanted to do. It was our place. One night changed all of that. There was a fairly large group of us. If I remember correctly; myself, Dan, Matt, Jaime, Heather, Chris, Liz, and Kevin. I promise you that it was a full moon on a breezy summer night. I know it sounds too perfect but some stories are.

I can't remember who saw it first but soon we all watched as a flashlight was coming toward us from the woods at the side of the beach. Immediately we assumed it was a police officer coming to tell us to get out of there. It had happened before and while we didn't get in any trouble we would still be bummed that we had to leave. But there was something off about the flashlight. It wasn't held rigidly as an officer would, it was bobbing around as if writing words in small cursive. As the person approached we saw it was a girl, roughly around the same age as we were which was 16-17. She stopped short of our group and held up the flashlight.

""What the fuck are you doing here?"" Her tone was accusatory as though she found us squatting under her porch. We didn't know how to react. We were a little shocked that this smaller girl had come up to a group of strangers and started cussing us out. I broke away from the group toward the girl. I figured I was pretty cordial and could at least try to diffuse her suspicion. As I stepped toward her she began to step back while her body took on a defensive rigidity.

She asked, ""What are you doing here?"" I told her that we were just hanging out because there wasn't much else to do. I asked her the same question back to her and she said ""I live here."" That's when I noticed it. In the seriousness of her face I could see her eyes were the brightest blue I had ever seen. As I said before, it was a full moon and no one else in my group had exceptionally bright eyes. But the strange girl's eyes were so brilliant and her pupils were small. Tiny little pin dots marked the center of her daytime sky blue eyes while the rest of us had large pupils in order to take in as much light as possible. She asked where we were from and as I motioned back to my group. I didn't realize how far away from them I was and how close to her I had gotten. She had even seemed to let her guard down. But there was still a vibe coming from her that I couldn't explain at the time but in retrospect this is the best I can do.

She was one girl, at night, by herself. When I tried to get closer to shake her hand she backed away and said ""stay away from me."" But he way she was acting and the way she said it made me feel like she wasn't afraid of what I would do to her but what she would to do me. Like a werewolf about to change, he asks someone to chain him up for the night to keep the population safe. She had the same energy coming off of her. Within a couple minutes she had dropped the giant metal flashlight to her side and began to tell me how she lived on the beach and that we shouldn't be there. It was almost as if she was trying to clear us out for our own good.

Then the whole group decided to come over to us at the same time. Any comfort that I had had been cultivating disappeared in an instant. She began to rear back again as my friends approached. Poor Liz, easily the nicest girl I'd met was starting to get frightened by this stranger's behavior. In fact, the whole of us were fairly worried about this loose cannon from the woods. Liz began to clutch her boyfriend Kevin and the stranger saw this. In a cutiepie condescending voice she said to Liz, ""Is the little princess getting scared?""

Liz let out a whimper and Kevin pulled her closer. My friend Dan, who was never one to mince words, said, ""wow, this girl is fucking weird!"" Meanwhile I am still the middle ground between the two. On one side of me I have my friends who are growing more uncomfortable and I have this strange girl who for some reason is comfortable with me but doesn't like the whole group. I barely noticed when she began to circle around me. To lighten the mood my friend Matt told Jaime to do his hilarious ""chicken dance"". To this day, I haven't seen it because right when Matt made his request the stranger shouted, ""I'll show you a chicken dance!"" She took her long metal flash light and made a huge overhead swing at Matt's skull. He barely dodged it and screamed, ""Holy Shit!"" The whole group took off running toward the dark trees and back to the cars...and she took off after them

I, on the other hand, had some trouble. If I began to run then she would remember I was there and focus her crazy attention on me. I knew for certain that I couldn't outrun her. We were on sand, I'm a fat guy, and the last time I checked insane beats terrified in a foot race. So, I walked. I walked toward the parking lot and watched my friends disappear into the darkness while being chased by some lunatic that would probably turn around and realize that I was an easy target. I could hear my friends screaming for me to hurry up, run, go, go, go! I looked back to see where the stranger was and she was just spinning in a circle amongst the trees, shining her flashlight into the branches above, and laughing the most sinister laughter I have ever heard.

I began to hustle up the driveway when I heard one final message from the stranger.

""Nice to meet you, Jeff!""




I don't remember ever telling her my name.

   I was working in one of the grade schools in my district over holiday break, not late, but only the custodial staff was there at the time. After a few hours, the three of them come to the basement where I setup shop for the day to let me know they were leaving. No biggie, I was gonna be done shortly anyway.

   They leave, and at this point I had been around the building quite a few times moving new computers into the classrooms and I KNOW I'm the only person there. Do a little more work and go to the restroom. This bathroom is at the back of the computer lab, down a hallway, that has a door opposite the mens room that leads upstairs. While in there, I hear the door close the some footsteps toward the bathroom door. No knock, just heavy breathing. I'm creeped out but it stopped quickly and I heard footsteps leading away.

   I walk back out to the lab and give the ""anyone there"" shout out....no answer. At this point I get the feeling that I need to leave. I don't know why, I just feel I need to be gone. So I pack up my laptop and start turning off the lights as I'm heading down the hall to the stairs. I get a few steps down the hall and that feeling is now ""you need to hurry"", so I pickup my pace and hit another set of lights and from far behind me at the back of the lab, comes a horrible, female scream. I jump and spin around, I see a glimps of a shadowy figure heading towards me and I sprint up two flights of stairs to get out.

  Don't know what it was, but other staff members quietly talk about doors slamming and cabinets opening on their owns. Others have admitted to getting that same ""need to not be here"" feeling.

  I will also mention that this particular school had a woman enter many years ago and kill a young boy and wound a few others, and that's after she tried killing multiple other kids she babysat that morning.

FYI. I purposefully left out some info about the school and the past incident simply because its a very wealthy and prominent area, and I don't want to deal with any possible backlash.

My mom used to work early weekday mornings and leave the house by 5:30AM leaving me alone to get dressed and take off for school. She used to leave me breakfest and a drink on a bannister that I could see just peeking outside my door. This particular morning something woke me up early as the sun was setting to a noise...I look out the door and I can hear the sound of liquid pouring into the cup i'm looking at but I don't see anything. I watch, it continues to pour till you hear that little trickle point where you have filled it to the top and don't want to continue to pour but no one is there the whole time. I alt ctrl delete and disregard it and go back to sleep. I wake up a little bit later to get dressed and turn on the tv I had in my room (yes I was one of those) to watch some early morning cartoons from my bed. While i'm doing that I hear something I cannot disregard...a mans voice from outside my door holding a tone, almost as if they were practicing singing, for about 5 secs, then the sound of the house shaking but the house is not shaking, then a blast of hot air comes over me. I proceed to slip into the electric boogie of fear and panic as i'm stuck in my room with no other exit but that door the sound is coming from. I do the only thing I can do and put the covers over my head and wait...finally getting the bravery to come out...when it happens again in the exact same order....to cut the story short I had to call a neighbor friend of mine to come over and ran like a mach5 out to room to the door downstairs to get him in there. I never set foot in that house again alone for years. My mother had gone to two psychics just for fun within a year of that incident and both confirmed independently without her saying anything that I had experienced something and it had something to do with my guardian angel so don't be afraid (yeah right). The funny thing is the only reason people have not believed this story is because I was watching the damn Beetlejuice cartoon that morning but it had absolutely nothing to do with it. Damn you Micheal Keaton in all your cartoon glory.

I've heard you people like to hear about premonition dreams and such, so I thought I'd share my experiences.

My first premonition that I recall was when I was six. In my dream, I went to a yellow house on a cul-de-sac and went inside and sat on the couch. A cat lay down across my shoulders and a kind old woman explained to me that ""Joan"" had died. 

I told my mother about my dream late that next afternoon, after school. She responded that I had been to the house in my dream when I was three, and played with the kitten. It was my Great Aunt Joan's house and she had died last night. The woman who was talking to me WAS Joan, and I felt bad for so disappointing the kind old lady by not recognizing her.

When I was 12, I had a dream that I was swimming across a river with my fat old beagle, Barney. Then I started to get pulled downstream in a current and grabbed ahold of him. He spluttered and started to drown, I let go and tried to swim ashore, but he continued to struggle and eventually drowned.

The next day my fake Uncle, my dad's good friend Jeff, came over and offered to drive us kids to ""The Wall"", the local swimming spot. We went, but I felt sick and detached the whole time. When we got home, there was a hole in the yard and Barney was dead, laying on an old shirt of my mom's.

Barney had choked on a piece of rawhide he stole from our new puppy.

At fifteen, I had a slightly different dream, because the situation was a little different. I dreamed of walking into my friend's dorm room and talking to him, admitting I loved him (which was a surprise to me even as the words tumbled out of my mouth). I don't think the dream meant romantic love, though when he responded ""You should have told me sooner. It's the end of the semester; it's too late."" I kissed him. Then I was pulled back to my room and woke up chilled in bed with a brief moment of sleep paralysis.

Three days later, I was at a friend's house for Christmas break and spent all day telling her stories about what I'd been up to at the boarding school she'd had to leave. Most involved this friend. Then her mother came down and told us he had died, of carbon monoxide poisoning in a closed garage...

I hadn't really known much about his personal life. It turned out he had never been kissed, and that I totally misconstrued a date with him as a friend date once. Lesbians are such bitches that way huh? His toxins report indicated high levels of the sleep aid Nytol as well. Never the less, they ruled the death a sad accident.

After that incident I must admit I did repeated ""trips"" on [Dramamine](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Dimenhydrinate.shtml). However, **once I stopped the drug use**, I started to have these 'awful' spells. My tongue and mouth would go numb, I'd get dizzy, and then I'd start dreaming, while still feeling fully conscious. It was very strange. I described it to doctors as both a hallucination and a dream, but they had no answers about either. 

I started going to the nurse's office during school when I felt a spell coming on. I said I had headaches, stomachaches, cramps, what ever it took. Then I'd go collapse into these strange waking dreams, awaking over and over in sleep paralysis. At first, I just became conscious, eyes closed, unable to move, able to hear and feel.

Then I started waking up, feeling my body in positions it just wasn't in - a few times, with a limb trapped, in horrible pain. I'd be able to see all around myself in perfect clarity, something I'm unused to thanks to glasses. Sometimes I'd watch the goings on in the room, but I couldn't untangle myself, sometimes couldn't move at all, then I'd snap back into my physical body and find it laying in a perfectly comfortable position.

Every time I had a spell during Physics or Early Civilizations, I found myself floating around near the ceiling, watching the events in the classroom. I saw the lecture board, the teacher, and my classmates, heard the discussions. It was insane.

I started smoking weed and it ties me to my physical body pretty well. But when I haven't smoked in a while, or I'm particularly stressed out, I know I will wake up and forget to wake my body up too.

Sleep paralysis is caused by the continued presence of a neurotransmitter that paralyzes the body during sleep, so it doesn't do what the brain is dreaming of doing... or what the brain is telling the astral body to do.

I guess something in me could always access the astral plane, but the drug dimenhydrinate felt like it severely weakened the connection between my astral soul and my body. As I grow further and further away from the time of my drug abuse, I grow better and better at staying in my body at night.

I do, however, make a conscious decision not to remember my dreams, because I always lucid dream. The symbolism is intense and the dreams feel more real and important than reality. So I started smoking weed heavily, like I said, in part because it's supposed to help with regulating sleep. 

I also play soundtracks (wordless) or ""holographic sound"" nature recordings. When I awake, I immerse myself in the sounds and return to dreams. 

Oh yeah. I have control over my dreams (I have thoughts and decision making and some manipulation of the environment) but there are other entities which have equal power to I. Often my own personal demons and goblins and other villains from fantasy, sometimes powerful people I know, sometimes a symbolic object/thing. When I try to escape the dream something of equal power is making, it gradually becomes isolated until it is all that I see... It pursues me into the blackness of consciousness before waking and flashes over and over again in my vision, reaching out to grab me... But this never happens with a real person in a dream like this. I can leave them.

When I manage to escape from whatever is holding me, I always have sleep paralysis, and I can always see the area around me. Sometimes just my room, sometimes the whole campus, sometimes the world -- very strange and saddening when I can see the world. Sometimes people come to me and beg me for help but I just have to forget about them, I can't do anything for them, I can barely help myself...

I'm meditating and trying to take control over my life, but I have no interest in what I ought to be doing, school work. I live in this world of dreams and energy and I find myself more and more detached from the physical plane.

Am I going insane? Or am I seeing the light?  Is there a difference? Why am I able to ask myself this question, anyway? I thought crazy people didn't know...

What else is there?

Oh yes, energy crystals are totally real. I have a great relationship with all of my jewelry. I got a new piece recently, a big polished teardrop of black Burmese amber, and when it landed around my neck beneath my Quartz it produced a great dizzying flash of gold light and three of my relatives said “those look great together!” at the same time. I physically cannot wear the amber without the quartz as I get an intense cold sensation where the quartz usually rests. 

I wear those two necklaces every day these days, as well as two rings. One is a garnet set in silver, and the other is a turquoise set in silver. I started wearing these rings about a month ago. I go through cycles with my jewelry as I go through phases in life, and often lose it after I use up it’s energy...

I used to wear a bloodstone, and tiger's eye, and a different garnet, set in gold. I lost all of them. I used to love my rough, ’practice-made’ flower ring, highly flawed emeralds and rubies set in silver. I still have it but cannot wear it, it just doesn't meld to my body. I have a solid silver ring with my name carved into it that has a similar property to it. I can't wear it any more. 

Wow, what a ramble. If you read that, you're a champ.

I guess because it does seem so farfetched that it doesnt seem real. But I promise you that every word I say in this post is real.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I promise that what I am saying really happened. These, at first did not direct affect me, but then later on, started, even after we moved. This all mostly happened when I was younger. I was around 4. We lived in a tiny house. Only 2 bed-rooms. The only bathroom was in the main bedroom and it could only be accessed through the kitchen. This is a major part to this. The first experience involved my mom. At the time, she and my step-dad did not have a bed in their room so they were using the pull-out bed in the couch as a place to lay their heads at night. This particular night, my mom was lying under a blanket covered from her neck down to her feet, meaning that she was warm (at the time, she was a very warm-natured person, but as this was a small house and we had very little heat source {a small kerosene heater in the kitchen} the blanket was necessary). She then got cold from the top of her neck to about the middle of her thigh. She said it felt like a small child had laid down beside her.

A while later, my step-dad was going to the bathroom (remember the layout I gave). He said that when he came back, he saw the shadows moving, and they looked like a tall man holding the hand of a small girl.

Even later than that, the front door was knocked off the frame. When they went to investigate, there was no large rock on the porch, and it was raining heavily, so there was mud in front of the house (probably should have mentioned that it was nothing but dirt in front of the house then the porch), but there was no footprints so no one came and hit the door really hard.

After this, they decided to move (THANK GOD!!!). Mom was cleaning out the fridge when she started hearing footsteps. She was the ONLY person in the house when this happened. She heard them walking towards her, and they got pretty close, according to her. After a few seconds, it was like whoever it was that was beside her jumped and stomped as loud as they could. Mom said they left that house have haven't looked back.

That was just the first of our family's dealings with the supernatural stuffs. The middle school that I attended had someone die in the auditorium. It seemed like every time I walked by, the doors slammed, even though they were supposed to be locked, meaning that no one should have been in there. That happened with not only me, but a lot of other people.

The weirdest/scariest thing I have ever dealt with is stuff in my current house falling (before we got the cat). I was home by myself when I heard loud noises coming from the back of the house. At first, I thought they were nothing more than the house popping. But then, it got to where it was becoming more consistent and it seemed to sound like footsteps. It seemed to originate in my room, which is a newer addition (I live in an old mill house and the back part of the house was added later, which includes my room, the laundry room, and the bathroom). I told no one for fear of looking like a crazy person.

It just so happened that last night, I was talking to my sister about some weird things that have happened in my house. She said that for a long time now, she has had dreams of a man who kinda reminded her of Benjamin Franklin, but a skeletal figure, around the back end of the house, near my room. I am a very spiritual person, but also acknowledge that there are things that even religion can't explain. Since these happenings, I have kept rose quartz, amethyst, and crystal in my room at all times, along with a few new added gems I recently received. I also have my class ring with my birthstone (sapphire) in it that is said in the Wiccan tradition (keep in mind I am christian but acknowledge the possibility/probability that crystals and gemstones really do have the powers that have been associated with them) to protect against spiritual attacks and to help boost the inner third eye. It has helped me see more deeply into problems such as problems between friends, and has even allowed me to somewhat see into the future (better that than the past). Because of these stones and ring, the weirdness has stopped, but it makes me wonder what would happen if I was to remove my ring and take the crystals out of my room.

About two months ago, I come home after being away at school and partake in one of my favorite activities while being home:  couch naps.
couch naps are awesome.  What's even better, is that no one is home to bother me or wake me up or give me crap for sleeping on the couch.  So I take to the downstairs couch-

Commence carefree snoozing.

I sleep a tremendous sleep, but of course, eventually wake up.  I struggle to keep my eyes open.  But the struggle is more than usual, its seems nearly impossible to open my eyes and it feels like they're rolling back in my head.  I try to move my arms, but nothing happens.  I think to myself, ""self, this is sleep paralysis""  which I've experienced about 3 times before.  

But then, I hear someone walking around upstairs.  Heavy walking.  Then murmuring from upstairs, and it's not a voice I can recognize.  Then i hear the sound of someone coming down the stairs and coming up right behind my head, behind the armrest of the couch.  I can hear  breathing.  Then a soft, drawn out whisper of the word ""Belial"" is spoken from behind my head. 

Confused? 
You bet.

Now, instead of trying to open my eyes and move around, I shut them tightly.  I can feel tears starting to form in my eyes.  I'm a 22 year old guy.  I don't cry often.  I try not to move or make a sound.  Soon after I'm able to move and get up and look down on the floor, behind the armrest.  I don't see a thing.  I walk upstairs, look out at the driveway and only see my car.  No one is home.  

I think the whole thing over in my head and chalk it up to sleep paralysis, but I can't shake how real it seemed.  I felt things, and heard things-  far away and right behind me.  I keep replaying the whisper in my mind and decide to search the word online. It sounded so familiar to me.  I type in what I heard phonetically, and I ended up spelling the word correctly- only it's not a word, it's the name of a demon.  'Belial' is a demon in the catholic and jewish religion.  I'm sort of a roman catholic and this is pretty terrifying right about now.  

I still can't decide if it was sleep paralysis or worse.    ",,False,,t5_2sntx,True,,,True,t3_jgk0l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/jgk0l/sleep_paralysis_or_worse/,

[ME],WindmillDragons,22,12,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1j6o64/i_promise_this_story_wont_end_the_way_you_think/,"Ok. First, let me say this. I don't believe in the paranormal or anything, but at the time of this story I did. So I'm sure there is an explanation for everything in this story. But. I don't have the explanation and it still makes a fun story so here goes.

I was driving home from work on a night that was darker than usual because of oncoming rain. I had my friend on the line just to shoot the shit. A car passed me on the highway and I caught a reflection of something in my own windshield. It was a pair of eyes. Similar to my own but lacking glasses and arranged in a way that they could have accompanied a scowl.

Understandably, I started to freak out a bit. I thought there was some murderer in the back seat of my car. But I also wanted to try to stay a step ahead of the creep in the back seat.

I figured that if I kept my friend on the line, then at the very least, if the call ended with a yelp and a click then he could call the police...or something. So our conversation devolved into me simply repeating
""Just stay on the buddy. I can't tell you why. Just stay on the line.""

At this point, neither one of us could really be described as calm, cool, or collected. But again, I divert your attention to the lunatic in my car and hope you understand. I drove about another eight minutes until I got to a well lit has station with a load of people on it. I pulled in. Stopped the car. And jumped the fuck out. As one does.

As people looked at me from across the gas station, I walked back up to my car to inspect the back seat. Nothing, of course. Well, no damage done. I'm sure I wasn't the first crazy person everyone stared at in the gas station that day.

A few nights later I had mostly forgotten about the last experience. That is, until I saw a dark outline of a person sitting in my backseat. I noticed ""him"" in my rear view mirror. Didn't actually mind this occasion as much. I have worse stories than a shadow person looking pretty chill in my back seat.

I made as close to as what I felt was eye contact with ""him"" through the mirror and essentially said that I didn't mind if he or any of his buddies just wanted to chill or grab a ride, but to please just not screw with me. I thought that was fair.

A few nights later, it was a another dark, about-to-rain night and my radio was acting up. Kept going to static for a few seconds. In one of these static sessions, I heard a raspy voice whisper my name. I listened for more, but didn't hear anything.

The very next night, I was playing Call of Duty: World at War in my basement. It was some campaign level that took place at least partially underground. A group of the enemies were advancing and I saw an area to the right of the entrance where they would be entering. I heard the same raspy voice whisper ""there"" from right beside me.

I hid there and equipped my shotgun. The enemy ran past me, and I blew them away.

1374325902.0,12,self.Thetruthishere,1ioyj4,[ME][FR] The group house.,zombiesnakes,18,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1ioyj4/mefr_the_group_house/,"A few years ago, a friend of mine, who I'll refer to as D, was looking for roommates to move in with him in his grandma's old house. It was 3 bedroom, and large enough to facilitate 6 people, and that's how many ended up living there. Being a few years ago, some of the events are a little fuzzy to me, but there are events that 5 of the 6 of us had either shared, or had individually.

Initially when we moved in, nothing seemed weird. All new houses are weird, but that's just how a new house usually is for me, *weird*. Not everyone had experiences like I said, and only 2 of the other house mates were willing to actually share theirs, the third was very put off by it, and refused to believe there was a ghost, or other entity.

The 3 bedrooms were shared by 2 people each, and were large enough to hold both beds, and also all of our personal belongings without being cramped. The first couple of days after moving in, I was awoken in the middle of the night by the sound of footsteps in my room. My roommate hadn't moved in yet, and wouldn't for a few days. At first I was a little freaked out, and laid still, listening to the sound of the steps go around my bed, from one side to the other. After only a few moments, I sat up, and looked around. The footsteps ceased, but I was still a little bothered. This ended up happening on several nights in my room.

Moving forward, we've been in the house about 2-3 months, exact timing I can't remember, when I sat down with E and S to ask them if they noticed anything happening in the house. E and S shared a room. They told me that they had been hearing footsteps coming from my room late at night, and that their door handle rattles at night. They always kept their door locked at night, and were romantically involved, so locking their door wasn't unusual.

Myself, and E, were often returning from, or going to work late at night/early morning, generally when everyone else was asleep, or up in their rooms. Whenever I left for work in the early mornings, typically before the sun was up. I was always certain I kept seeing someone walk throughout the lower part of the house. I hadn't noticed it at first, but it was becoming a glaring realization that I was seeing an entity move about. I decided to ask E to see if he had been having the same odd feelings, and he confirmed, detailing them similar to mine.

As far as the previous events had gone, I felt somewhat uneasy in the house, but quickly remedied it by keeping my shoes in my room for work, so that I could bolt downstairs in the mornings, what brought the events to a head occurred in the following weeks.

We decided to have a house meeting regarding the events. During the meeting, D finally admitted that he had a strange occurrence but dismissed it due to his fatigue. He went to get food in the middle of the night from the fridge, and said he saw it slowly open as he went in, only to slam shut before he touched it. After telling us about it, he started denying it happened. I'm assuming he might have been messing with us. At the end of our meeting though, we sat down and had a few beers, talking about normal happenings in our lives. During this talk though, we hear footsteps upstairs in the house, while we're still all gathered in the living room. The steps were heavy, and quick, and continued on for several minutes before stopping. Things were calm for a few days after that.

Fast forward again, I don't remember how long, and I return home from work, the only person in the house. I go upstairs, take a shower, and as I exit the bedroom, I hear a door slam shut downstairs. I go downstairs to see who just got home, and everything in the house has been tossed onto the floor. The closets and cabinets all opened through the house, and just rummaged through, and the backdoor barely closed. Needless to say I stayed in the living room with the curtains open till someone got home.

Going forward another length of time, I'm once again taking a shower in the upstairs bathroom. The shower had the fogged glass to keep you from seeing clearly through the other side of it. I turned around at one point to wash the back of my head, as my hair is long, and I noticed a weird black shape by the bathroom door. I slid the door open, and it was gone, I wasn't able to create the visual representation again. After my shower though, something slams on the bathroom door, and I bolt downstairs as soon as I'm dressed. In panic, S comes upstairs, being the only other one home, heads upstairs to see what the noise is. She confirms it wasn't her, and I shrug it off.

Shortly after, due to some unforseen events, we had to move out.

My grandparents had bought it in the 1960’s and renovated it. From the first night I stayed there I always felt terrified. 

For 5 years I rarely slept without a light on, I wouldn’t turn lights off whilst still in the room, and I constantly felt watched. Every time I entered the attic I wanted to cry with fear, and eventually I refused to go up there alone. 

When I did turn the light out to sleep I would hear a noise like something being rolled across the floorboards in my room. As soon as I flicked the bedside light on the noise would stop. After a few months I began listening to my CD player at night to drown out the rolling noise. I would wake up in the morning to find the ear buds of my headphones had been cut off - my mother said it was probably field mice, but field mice tend to leave teeth marks, not cleanly cut wires!!

There was a door at the bottom of the stairs with a gap at the top, I would regularly find myself looking at it as I felt someone was stood on the stairs watching me through the gap. Likewise, when I was playing the piano I couldn’t stop looking over my shoulder at a particular corner of the room, as if someone was sat watching me, I couldn’t be in this room after dark. Whilst playing in the garden I again would find myself looking at certain windows as if someone was there watching. Being alone in the house babysitting my very young sister was a terrifying experience - I always felt someone was in there with me and always watching.

There would be other things like foot steps distinctly heard as if on floorboards when the rooms were carpeted, things not being where you left them but in another room, wallets disappearing and the contents lining up down the centre of the dining room table, ornaments facing the wrong way on a shelf, fire guards rattling etc. At this point, despite being a fan of ghost stories I hadn’t realised we were dealing with a Poltergeist. 

One day in 2000 I was sitting in my room reading a book when I heard a thud. I looked up to find a pile of books that had been on top of my bookcase were now on the floor, 18 foot across the room still perfectly stacked by the door. I shook it off, thinking there was obviously a logical explanation for the books moving 18 foot on their own and still being in formation!! I went back to my book and then I heard a “tap, tap, tap...” noise and looked up to find a pile of cassette tapes moving one at a time off the top of a speaker and re-stacking on the floor. I couldn’t handle things moving on their own so fled the room to find my mum. I sat down in the kitchen apparently looking terrified and recounted my experience. She admitted we had a ghost, and she had hidden that knowledge from me in an attempt to prevent me being scared. As she was explaining what was going on there was an almighty smash from the far end of the house and we discovered a very large gilt framed antique mirror had been thrown 18ft across a room and smashed. 

From this point things intensified; more noise, movement, footsteps, radios turning up and down on their own. At one point I became so depressed through the emotional stress that I attempted suicide and had a nervous breakdown during my last year of school. My mum experienced a lot of things as well but won’t talk about it much, she would regularly hear someone close the front door, walk upstairs and towards my parents bedroom but no one would appear.  

Eventually we had to get the local priest in to bless the house. My mum was sure the ghost passed over through her. One evening a few weeks after the priest had been, my mum was in the kitchen and suddenly felt very heavy and couldn’t move as if she was in someone else’s body and she was afraid if she spoke it wouldn’t be her voice that came out. After a few minutes the feeling passed and the activity stopped. Unfortunately we still own a converted barn on the property. I flatly refuse to go anywhere near the house.

I decided to post here since I read on /r/paranormal that this was the place where you should come if you want to talk about real life experiences..

When I was 9 years old, I was in an indoor swimming pool with my sister and my two cousins, while we were on vacation. The swimming pool had weird lights at the roof, it were some sort of iron poles with lights on them, and the poles were attached to the roof with strips or iron strings or whatever, here is a pic of what I mean http://imgur.com/7Sot9kF (I hope you figure it out). Well, at some point, I all of a sudden knew for sure that in a couple of seconds one certain pole is going to fall and land in the water. The problem was that I became completely paralyzed and didn't say anything. The pole falls, luckily nobody got hurt and the pool was evacuated.

When I was 11 years old, I was sitting in front of the TV on a saturday  morning and all of a sudden I knew for certain that the phone would ring and a person would tell me that my father had a road accident. The phone rang and I was doubting between immediately telling my mom that dad had an accident, or picking up the phone and then tell her. I decided to pick up the phone so she would actually believe me (I was afraid she would think I was just being weird if I'd just go to her and tell dad had an accident without any proof besides my feelings).
And yes, the person on the phone told me my father had an accident, which was true..

Can anybody help me with it? I've only told about two people about this all my life and they just thaught I was being odd..

The dreams weren't always specific - there were details missing or sometimes even wrong. But the event itself was right. I'm probably going against my own case saying so, but I'm just trying to be as honest as I can about what happened. The first few times I brushed it off as coincidence but it kept happening and happening. There are enough that I can't remember them all, but I can tell you a couple of examples that for one reason or other have stuck in my mind. 

There was one about finding a key, and another about finding a necklace. Both of which happened the next day, respectively. 

There was also a dream around the time of the boxing day tsunami that i won't go into out of respect. I go to type it out and it just feels wrong. 

The last time it happened that sticks in my mind was a dream of a car crash. I was worried it would happen so made sure to tell a lot of people about this weird dream I had (it didn't seem to happen where people knew, but it could be coincidence). During the week some friends of mine had arranged to go camping in a forest. Initially I was in, but I backed down due to paranoia getting the better of me. They decided not to go without me. Then at the weekend there was a crash in which a friend of a friend died - this happened a couple hundred meters down from where we were meant to be camping. 

It all could have been coincidence - it wasn't every single dream I had that had some relevance. There was no real way of telling other than a hunch. But it happened often enough to convince me.
But it's not happened in years now. I'm paranoid about a nightmare from the other night but I doubt anything will come of it. I may have been reading too much nosleep. 

I don't know why the dreams have stopped. Maybe I just got too old for it, maybe it was the room I used to be in (thought my sister has reported nothing unusual). Maybe it was the guilt that lurked over what happened last time. Has anyone else had anything like this happen?

Did it stop? Do you know why? How did it start?

One saturday morning, I was playing with my makeshift microscope (it was basically an empty toilet paper roll, and a small mirror). I placed an ant on the mirror and  pretended to study it using the empty toilet paper roll. I remember my teacher telling us that when using the microscope, you don't stick your eye to the eye piece, rather you leave a small space in between. Bearing that in mind, I continued to ""study"" the ant. I was observing it's every movement while the mirror reflected my right eye.


Suddenly, I saw my right eye blink in the mirror.


I fuckin threw away that toilet paper roll and the mirror.
I tried to come up with a logical explanation as to why that happened.

I grew up in the South East part of Amsterdam. 
This place was dubbed The Getto, because a lot of black (Surinamese people) lived there/where put there due to history.


I used to live in a appartement building called Klieverink. 
And I grew up in this place.


In 1992 a Israeli cargo plain hit one of the appartment nearby (Groeneveen - Kruitberg) building resulting in the deaths of at least 50+ people, with thé aftermath having a LOT of secrecy.


I can go on with this story some other time if you guys would like, because there are interesting (conspiracy like) details with this one.


But my story is something different.

As I said, I grew up in this large appartment building.

[The layout of this house is as follow](http://i.imgur.com/PyvFRgG.gif)

There was a room that always scared me because it was dark (mainly due to its dark red curtains my mom placed there, and they where closed 99% of thé time we lived there.
But also due to a strange vibe that i felt in that room.

My family never felt a vibe in that room. 
My sisters and me used to dub it  ""Het laatste kamer"" (the final/last room)

This room was a hobby room for my dad. 
He would spend hours in there (experiencing absolutely nothing).
He was also a goldsmith, and he used to do his work in that little extra area in that room.
At chest hight there was a plank with all thé goldsmith stuff.


I used to sleep next to my younger sisters room for years growing up, untill my family desides i shouldn't be a scared little batch any more and i should man up to have my own room.

I refused to go in that room but got told I didn't have no choice in this matter.

They said that I can go spend a few nights in that room to get used to it.

The first few nights nothing happened, except for the strange vibe, but I shrugged that off like they said that I should do.

The third night in that room, the room to that door was open (relevant) and I tried sleeping. 
Being the light sleeper, I woke up to a sound, followed by the door leading to the small goldsmith area slowly opening.

I was scared by this but I shrugged it off, trying to sleep.

All off thé sudden, I felt something tap my face.

I didn't respond to this, but again something tapped my face, but this time it was forced and harder and hurt my face.

The third time something put its nails in my eyelids pulling my eyes open.

When my eyes opened I saw a woman (not my mother or either of my sisters, aunts or any one we know) with the age around 35-45.

Startled I said ""Hello, who are you"", she waved me hello, in a strange and friendly but creepy way like a psycho serial killer.

This was followed by an instant grab to the throat, and she really clenched her nails into my throat too.

And she grabbed my nose to instantly causing me to suffocate.

While she was suffocatie me, she her face had a faint smile, but this morphed into a demonic looking face.


Out of all coincedences, I heard my dad entering the toilet.

I tried to call for my dad but I couldn't.

When he got out of the toilet, i called out for him again, using all the force i had left.

I was very lucky that my dad heard me because almost no sound came out of my mouth.

My dad was standing in the doorway, trying to figure out what was happening, and I think he saw her, but he was really sleepy.

So he asked ""What's wrong?"" 

Then I said ""Help!""


The whore that was grabbing my throat looked up at the door, and in an instant the door flies shut.
My dad didn't raise his and to the door to shut it, for all you non believers, and neither did she run to the door, she just looked at it.

When the door shut, my dad tried to open it (this door opens inwards) with all his force but he couldn't.

There was nothing physical blocking this door, I know because I saw nothing blocking this door.


When my dad finally managed to open the door, this whore fled to the goldsmith area and disappeared, closing the door.

When I explained everything to them they didn't want to believe me. 

Later on they believed me because a priest confirmed everything I experienced.



Months went by and nothing happened again, untill one day.

I remember going to the toilet one day (afternoon) and the door to the final room being closed.

When I was done with my toilet business, I heard a knocking on the final room.

This door opened and I saw the same whore standing in the doorway, signalling me to come to her.

I took a few steps closer because she gave me a (false) sense of safety.

When all off the sudden, something inside (Guardian Angel?) me said ""NOOO, don't go there!! She is evil, VERY EVIL"".

Then the whore said in a more angry and annoyed way ""COME OVER HERE"" and she even pullen her demon face.

Then the thing inside me said ""TELL HER YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD AND TELL HER TO LEAVE YOU ALONE"" 

Which I did, in a demanding non scared tone.

And then I tried running away from her.

I was almost at my parents room, when I was grabbed by my foot and dragged across the floor.

I quickly turned around while being dragged across the floor and I saw that whore still standing in the doorway having an very eerie and evil smile.
When I turned around I saw nobody dragging me.


I screamed for my mother and this woman disappeard in the room.

After that my mother angrily investigated the room and found nothing (goddamnit) 

I got punishments from my mother because I screamed with out a reason (If they only knew)

I think the woman still followed me, because I have seen her twice since we moved into our new house.

It was said that this is the most reported paranormal phenomenon in the US since 2010. I have searched for him on Youtube, Google and Reddit. They all come up with plenty of reports about him, I have read the comments and see that many people describe him as I have seen him.

I do not see him anymore but he did not scare me when I saw him. One thing that does creep me out about all this is that researchers usually ask if something bad happened after he appeared.

I was telling them that I've had reoccurring dreams like that, in certain, specific locations. One of the most common being this strange old mansion. A lot of the features were very distinct, such as specific damage done to certain areas, specific secret  doors and hallways, art, et cetera. 

I had only gone through some of the basic descriptions of this place, when they stopped me, their faces covered in mild shock. 
They each started describing specific places I had been to in the dreams. They had been there, too.

During the conversation, we made no attempts to lead each other on, mostly because we wanted to make sure that we would not accidentally change our own interpretation... To keep things legit. They even described things that I had seen in passing, such as out of a window or through a hallway. They mentioned details I would purposely leave out. 

The strange thing is, we had all met other people who had dreamt of the same mansion. We totaled about seven, including the three of us who were talking at the time. However, except for the three of us, no one knew each other... My acquaintances didn't know theirs.

This is the first time I have posted on this sight. Although for several weeks now I have been very much addicted to reading other peoples encounters and stories. Without further adiue I shall present one of my own encounters. . . I shall here encourage the reader to light up a cigarette or pour a stiff drink and hopefully enjoy my words....  first off I shall start by saying that I had many encounters in the house I grew up in which was built in 1839. If this post goes well and there is interest I shall post more. I decided to start with one of the more shocking enounters I have had. . .to set the scene it was the fall of 2007 which was a good year I shall. Add. Neevertheless it was late one night I had decided to lay down in the spare bedroom. I shall note that many strange things occured in this room. I closed my eyes for a moment as I layed on the bed in the darkness. As I layed there I suddenly became aware of a feeling asthough someone had entered the room. I opened my eyes and was someone surprized to see that the bedroom door which had previously been closed was now ajar. I had fluffed it off as being one of the three cats that we had perhaps entering the room yet I could not shake the strange feeling that I was being watched. I looked away from the open door and to the foot of the bed. At the foot of the bed I saw something that will forever be ingrained on my mind. I saw a looming figure gazing down upon me. I immediatly screamed. The figure lingered for probably about 10 seconds before just fading preditor like into the darkness of the room. I jumped up and ran out of the room. It was definitly the clearest look at an apparition I had ever had. It stood 8 ft. I know this because the ceiling in the room was just over 8 ft and the figures head was at the height of the ceiling or just below it. The width of the figure was easily as wide as a standard refrigerator. It appeared to be wearing what at the time reminded me of an ebeneezer style nightgown. Strange as it sounds that's the best description I can give it. The type of nightgown a man may have worn back in earlier times. The head was bald and white. The ears were sharp. The face demonic in appearance for lack of a better term. If I had to liken it to anything I would say it had the appearance of nosferatu from the 1922 film of the same name. Anyway so that's what I saw I didn't sleep or step foot in the spare room for weeks. I had then and have now chills all over my body just thinking about it. Another strange aspect of this story is that afew days later I recived validation of sorts. I had came home late from band practice and stood in the doorway to the kitchen and called out to my grandma whom I lived with at the time to bid her goodnight. The next morning she asked me who my friend was? I was confused by this as I had came home alone the previous night. She said that when I told her goodnight from the kitchen there had been an extreemly tall man standing directly behind me! That's one of many strange occurance I have had. It remains a complete mystery to me as to what this entity could have been. Has anyone else encountered anything like this? Or have any idea what this could have been? The ghost of christmas past? It seems like in my memory I have heard about giant ghosts before somewhere but could be wrong. Any speculation would be appreciated. ,,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1c4bo1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1c4bo1/the_tall_man/,

I'm just here to tell my story, about an old house and some stupid decisions. Corny, I know, but it's something I've wanted to share.  
Around two or three years ago, my friends and I had discovered a local abandoned house. Weeds around it were overgrown, and it was all seemingly deserted. They had told me they had been here before, and so I was prepared. The inside was rather small, not much to look at, nothing really. But the kid's room, wow. There were toys, Yu-Gi-Oh cards, and even a broken old playstation on the floor. We also found a journal. I swear there were two when we got there, but I've only been able to find one since. Nothing scary at all in the journal either, just stupid kid stuff with some drawings. We left that place with no problem. Skip forward a year or two...  
I decided to stop by again with a completely different friend who hadn't been there before. Being a ballsy dumb 16 year old, I decide to take the journal back home with me, as well as a picture of the kid. As we were walking back away from the house, we heard something, like a metal clang. We tried to ignore it, and when I returned home I put a bible on top of the journal, just to be safe.  
That summer, I decided to take the journal back with a few friends of mine. It was a nice day outside, and my parents were off at work. What happened next was what really got to me. The wind picked up, and clouds darkened the sky. In a few minutes the wind got so powerful, pushing us in the complete opposite direction of our destination. We had to yell at each other, to return back. When we got back, the wind had calmed down, but my backyard was wide open, and my dog was running around the front yard. We got him back in the backyard and went inside, only to find the power had gone out. We all joked around about it, and maybe it was all just a really big coincidence. I don't know.  
Around November I went back there again, with one friend who had gone with me earlier, and two friends whose faith would be strong enough to help out. Stupid, yes, but I was too terrified to care. We went around 8 on a Friday night, I believe it was. It was so dark outside. Once we finally got there, I didn't even enter the room. I tossed the journal into the room, and called out, ""I'm sorry!"" While we walked out, I heard the same sound I heard years ago. And again, we all tried to rationalize the situation. I haven't been back since, and I don't plan to.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_1bpj86,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1bpj86/abandoned_house_and_the_journal_of_a_child/,

The first night we ever experienced anything my parents were out and I was home with my younger brother and sister. We were in the family room watching tv when we heard the door leading to our garage start to make strange noises. The handle started to turn back and forth quickly as if the door was locked and someone was trying to open it. My brother, sister and I all looked at each other and dismissed the noise as us just hearing things or possibly wind. Then the noise happened again, and we all dismissed it again. Then the door shook violently, like someone was grabbing the door handle from the other side and jerking the door back and forth as hard as they could. I figured that maybe my dad had a bad day or something and came home to find the door locked and became frustrated and was trying to get in. I got off the couch and walked into the laundry room to go open the door and noticed the door was unlocked. I opened the door to find complete darkness and when I turned on the light I was just staring into a completely empty garage, no cars, no one was home. I remember turning on the light and just standing in the doorway staring into the garage and immediately feeling horrified. To me the creepiest thing is all three of us heard the door, it wasn’t just me, or just my brother or sister. All of us heard it.

I was pretty much always the last person to go to bed in my house, and almost every night I would go up stairs lay down in bed and then I would hear my dad walk from his bedroom down the hall to the family room and then back down the hall to his room and then he would repeat that a few times. I always just assumed he was just checking the house to make sure everything was alright. One night I got in bed and heard my dad walking the hallway and I wanted to ask him a question so I opened my door and walked to a railing that overlooked the end of the downstairs hallway that my parents room was at and loudly said “hey dad!” After a couple seconds my parents door opens and out steps my dad and he asks what I want. I was very puzzled by this and asked him “wasn’t that you just walking down the hallway?” He then gave me a very strange look and replied “No, I thought that was you”. It turned out that my dad never came out and walked down the hall to check things out after I went to bed, and he always assumed it was me walking around. After that night both my dad and I would still hear the footsteps after I went to my room. Most nights I would go to bed and lay down and just wait and listen and then I would hear footsteps walking down the hall and then I would hear my parents door open and my dad step out checking to see who was out there. He never saw anything.

The creepiest thing I ever experienced in that house happened when we were moving out. Telling this story still gives me goose bumps all over my arms. One night as we were moving my dad asked me to go back to the house and grab a tv cable he had left in his bedroom. I agreed to go. By the time I got to the house it was pretty late at night. I walked into the house and it was freezing which was weird because it was fairly warm outside. I walked into my parents room and as I walked in I flung the door closed behind me. I find the cable still connected to the wall and start unscrewing it. At that moment I start hearing footsteps walking around upstairs at a fairly fast pace. As I pull the chord out of the wall and get up ready to go investigate the footsteps turn into an all out run that goes from my old room, down the hallway to the stairs, down the stairs, hit the hardwood floor at the bottom, then run down the downstairs hallway and stop right outside the door of my parents room. I sat there staring at the door waiting for it to open for a couple seconds and then I slowly walked to the door and open it. Nothing. Nobody standing there, no other noises just nothing. Completely consumed by fear I walked out of the room to the front door and walked out of the house and I never set foot in there again.

1363482692.0,11,self.Thetruthishere,1afulc,[FAM] A story my grandma shared with me ,DesiDaku,18,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1afulc/fam_a_story_my_grandma_shared_with_me/,"This is a story my grandma told me a long time ago when I was visiting my family in India. She recently visited us here in Cali and I asked her to tell me stories like she used to when I was a little. She told me the exact same story in the exact same words she used so long ago, and she swears by it being true. This was when she was a kid, so 1940
- 1950s maybe? Sorry for length.

Here is some background info. This is my family on my mothers side, but my grandma stayed in that town when she was a kid. My parents are very distantly related because arranged marriage and India so wtf lol. The town itself is pretty small, rundown, my family owns one of the bigger houses and a pretty prosperous farm there. There were no streetlight back then and it was basically a farming town. 

Anyways, my grandpa on my mother's side, being a good deal older than met grandma (on my dads side) had just returned from a local political discussion. The big farmers pretty much are part of the local government there because, well India haha. Anyways, it was getting late and the dude who usually took care of the farm was out sick. Most of the farm work had been completed, except for an outlying farm that made a little money on the side for my family. 

But before I can continue this story, I have to tell you this story. 

The outlying farm a few decades ago or so used to be owned by two brothers. One of them was particularly identified by his broken, jagged teeth. The entire town used to call him Broken-Tooth, and he handled the farm well. His brother grew jealous of him over time though, and pretty much ganked him when Broken-Tooth had a particularly good harvest. Anyways, it was pretty much a local legend that Broken-Tooth's pissed off spirit haunted the farm in the early hours of morning and night. 

The farm my grandpa was headed.

So picture this scene. There's no light but the dim light held by my grandpa sitting in a big tractor chuggin down an empty dirt road a couple miles away from town, headed to some obscure farm supposedly haunted by a vengeful spirit. Anyways, he's driving when this random dude just materializes out of the darkness. My grandpas pissed off. It's late and some hoe is stopping him from going where he wants to go. 

The man is dark, dressed in all white traditional Indian farmer's garb, and he has a hardness to his eye and face. My grandpa asks him what the fuck he wants. The man says this is my farm. My grandpa laughs at him and threatens to run him over with the tractor. The man doesn't budge and continues to insist it's his farm. My grandpa asks the man who he is and the man smiles revealing jagged teeth, proclaiming that he is Broken-Tooth. My grandpa turns the tractor around and goes as fast as he can home. He is cold and shivering and my grandma remembers him being incredibly scared and frightened. 


My mom doesn't believe this story, but my grandma tells me it's true.
She's never met a ghost, and doubts anybody does after street lamps were added to the town, but she says the story is 100% legit.


What do you guys think? :)

1360872383.0,11,self.Thetruthishere,18j912,"[ME][FAM] My story, part 1",Autumnsprings,17,6,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18j912/mefam_my_story_part_1/,"It begins before I was born.  My father's parents had 3 children.  A girl, then my dad, then another girl.  This last child died 3 days after she was born.  No one ever spoke of her, and in fact I didn't learn of her until I was 8 or so.  Apparently, when I was 18 months old, my grandparents were babysitting me.  They were downstairs doing laundry, and my grandfather says ""Are you my little girl?""  (Or something to that effect).  I replied calmly, ""Yeah grandpa cause your little girl died didn't she.""  Understandably, they were quite freaked.  They called my mother at work immediately to find out if she had any idea how I knew about her.  My mother said they had never mentioned her to me (and, knowing what I know of child development, I doubt that at a year and a half old, I would have been able to make any significance to the words.)

 A few things happened off and on, mostly knowing when people were going to die.  Most notably, my great uncle (who was pretty much my grandfather since my mother was raised by him and her aunt).  A different great uncle died a bit before my grandfather (maybe a month or so).  My grandfather had been having some health problems and was in the hospital, but was expected to make a full recovery and go home.  One night, before I was asleep, I heard my uncle's voice say, ""Grandpa will be coming home soon.""  Instinctively, I knew he didn't mean home with my grandmother.  I told my mother the following morning.  He died a week later.  


There was also a woman whose shop my mother and I used to visit. We hadn't been in a while, and one day, I just randomly said to my mother, I wonder how so-and-so is? We saw her obituary within a few days.


Finally, I had a dream that I was in a particular house (I'd never been in it, but had been on the street), trying to help a man that was having a heart attack. I couldn't. This took place on a Saturday night. The next day (Sunday) I was at church (which faces the street the house was on) and I saw ambulances at the house I had dreamed I was in. Monday, I asked a guy in one of my classes who lived on that street what had happened. He said the man had had a heart attack. I said ""weird"". He asked why, so I told him about my dream. He asked if the man lived or not. I said no. The guy died on Wednesday.

All of this (except for knowing about the baby who died) could possibly be coincidence. I understand that. But the experience that affected me the most follows:

Let me preface by saying that anyone who knows me, knows I don’t scare easily. I don’t freak myself out. 

My grandmother (my mom’s aunt who raised her) died. We were trying to figure out what to do with her house. She had left half to her surviving siblings, and half to my mother. We considered buying out the siblings. Let me say I absolutely adored this house. I loved being in it, and never felt any uneasiness while there, even when alone. (After her death, I frequently went there to study). One night, I was studying and had just decided to pack up and go home. It was after dark, but that was nothing unusual for me. Suddenly, I had this immense terror. I KNEW without a doubt that something evil was in the house with me. I sensed it at one end of the living room, towards the bedrooms. I packed up as quickly as I could, constantly repeating “Our Father, who art in heaven” (that was all I could remember, even though I’ve known that prayer since I was 4 years old.) I could feel something trying to invade my mind. That’s the best way I can describe it. I felt my fear, but also it’s anger and rage, and insanity. I could not make myself go into that wing of the house. I felt like if I stayed there, I would literally lose my mind. I got to my car in the garage and was waiting for the door to go up enough for me to leave. The fear was so tangible I truly expected to see something look out the window panes on the door at me.
The whole way home, I was terrified. I had no idea what I had just experienced.

 Whatever was in that house, followed me home. For a month, it stood by my bed at night, trying to get into my mind. I couldn’t see it, but I could feel it. The only way I could get it to go away was to imagine the house surrounded by angels armed with swords, willing to protect me and my family. I told my mother at some point, and she suggested maybe it was a sign we weren’t supposed to buy the house.
My biological grandmother (my mother’s actual birth mother) came down for the funeral. (I think this was before my experience because I can’t imagine sleeping there after that). She came into the room I was sleeping in, and asked if I had gotten up. I said no, I had been in bed reading. She had heard footsteps in the living room.
After telling my mother about this, she told me that her aunt had been alone in the house one day and heard the lid of the candy dish in the living room clinking against the bowl. She walked into the doorway between the kitchen and living room and saw the lid floating in the air. This woman was the most rational person I’ve ever known, and wouldn’t have fabricated the story (or even told it if she wasn’t completely stumped).

My biological grandmother (the one who heard the footsteps) has had several experiences too, so I feel like it’s in my blood so to speak.

Other assorted stories, but these are the ones that stand out the most to me.

Or something else....,steampunker13,12,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/13q4bg/me_my_grandpa_coming_to_visit_me_or_something_else/,"So a few years back, my grandfather passed away. I was close to him, so it was hard on me. I had experienced death before though, my grandma had died (from the other side of the family), but what happened to me was totally new and I was totally unprepared for it.

One night, I did everything normally, brushed my teeth, said goodnight to everyone, and I went to sleep. At about one o'clock, I was woken up by a strange knock coming from the attic. The attic is right next to my room, but I dismissed it as the house settling because of the length of time between the knocks. I was into the paranormal then, so I was freaked out.

Night two was worse. The knocks were louder. I was definitely scared this time. I was awake for about twenty minutes before the knocks stopped. I didn't sleep well that night. I asked my sister if she had heard the noises in the morning. She told me she didn't know what she was talking about. The next few days were hell. The knocks continued and I swear I heard the attic door opening. One night, the second to last one, I went to bed and immediately felt sadness and fear, like something was pushing it into my mind. 

The final night was the worst. I went to bed, and at about three in the morning (Devil's Hour) I woke up to a strange creaking noise. It sounded like it was right outside my room, and it sounded like someone was walking. I started sweating. After about thirty minutes of completely lying still, I summoned all my courage, and looked up. There was nothing in the hallway, but I felt as if someone was watching me. After I rested my head, the noises continued shortly after. They were so close in length intervals that I dismissed it as regular creeks.

That was the end of my experience. So what do you think it was, my Grandfather, a demon that feeds of fear, or something else.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_13q4bg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/13q4bg/me_my_grandpa_coming_to_visit_me_or_something_else/,

I was still in high-school and that day went by like any other day. Whenever I got home I would sit in the living room, hook my iPod up to my computer speakers and blast music until my sister got home (I lived with her, she was my art teacher).  Our computer was in our living room against the wall and across the room we had an old piano (possibly from the 60's). Well, as I was sitting there blaring my music I heard a very loud, sharp note being hit on the piano, so loud I could hear it over my music. I stopped the music, curious as to what the hell just happened and walked over to the piano. The cover was down. I started to freak out (paranormal stuff just gives me the shakes), threw on my jacket and left the house for a couple hours. This was the only time it happened, at least with the piano. There have been other experiences as well. 

There was another time where I was in the said living room and heard a creak in the stairs..(yes, yes.. probably just the house cause it's old) but what was strange was that I could hear the creak moving down the steps and make its way into the living-room. Me and my sister always had an eerie feeling whenever we went upstairs.. I guess something lives up there. I'll never really know.

1351636833.0,9,self.Thetruthishere,12d57t,[Me] xpost from r/Paranormal; The Scaredest I Have Ever Been in my Life.,The_Beard,11,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/12d57t/me_xpost_from_rparanormal_the_scaredest_i_have/,"When I was a kid, I lived in a mildly haunted house. When I say mildly, I mean little weird things would happen but nothing huge or scary. Things like shower stopper ends disapearing out of the bathroom when there was no physically possible way and then turning up years later sitting atop the toilet bowl. Vaguely creepy but not terrifiying, right? There were always other little things too. But this incident takes the cake.

For backround, I am not a morning person, and this held true as a child. It was a Saturday morning, early as hell. My younger brother and I had stayed up particularly late (or what my 12 year old self deemed late at the time) and, he being an early riser regardless of how much sleep he got, I had politely warned him that if he woke me up early (as was his wont) that I would beat the crap out of him.

So, I was sleeping soundly when I heard a knock on my door. It registered in my head but only in my dream, you know? Then it came again, the knock. Three taps, both times. The third time I heard the tripple rapping, I was starting to come to. I grumbled to my brother to leave me the hell alone. Three more knocks answered me. Awakening more, I told my brother that I would kick his ass if he didn't go away. In response I heard three more knocks.

It was at this point that I came out of my sleepy state and recalled that I did not have a door. My brother and I had torn it up while jacking around and, as punishment, my father deemed that I would not have a door, and thus lack privacy, for a month. Coming to that realisation, I opened my eyes. At that moment came three more knocks.

I have terrible eyesight but my hearing makes up for it in subtle ways. I pinned down the source of the repeated rapping using a crude form of echolocation. It was coming from direcly in front of me, from inside my room, just above where I should be able to see. Then came three more knocks, confirming my echolocation, except I still could not see anything.

Up until that point, I had held out hope that it was all my brother screwing with me, but at that moment I gave up rational hope. Then my concrete floors began squeaking. In front of my bed, just out of eyesight. At that point, irrational hope set in that the squeaking would creak around my bed and there would be my brother. I would beat the life out of him but we would later have a good laugh.

When the creaking crept around my bed into my sight range and there was nothing there, that was when I began to panic. I stared at my floor for a few heartbeats, mind unable to grasp the sheer impossibility of what was happening. Then, I snapped.

I threw the comfortor over my head and began praying to God (I was a devout Christian at the time) to protect me. The squeaks kept coming. When the noise was even with my head, the left half of my face (the half nearest the noise) went numb and that ear filled with pressure, just like I was riding in a plane. As soon as the noise passed the area of my head, my ear popped and the numbness vanished. Then, the sound creaked out of my wall (an experience as odd as it sounds) and I was left alone with my mumbled prayers.

Eventually, after quite some time had passed and my rational mind returned, I grabbed my glasses and fled my room as fast as my young legs would carry me. I am not ashamed to say that I was absolutely terrified and can proudly say that I kept complete control over both my bladder and bowels in the single most horrifiying moment of my life.

During it all, I never felt threatened per se, but I cannot see any other conclusion than whatever being I encountered wanted me to know it was there and then do its best to scare the piss out of me. Any thoughts? Has anyone ever had any experience like this? 

Before you suggest sleep paralysis (as it was the number one such explantion from r/Paranormal), from what I understand about the condition, my experience does not qualify.  I was awoken by loud and repetetive auditory phenomenon.  I was not initially terrified nor was I unable to move.  I craned my neck and raised my chest in anticipation for whatever was supposed ot come into view.  As I mentioned, I was also readily capable of throwing my covers over my head.  The only point at which I was paralysed was when the being crept around the corner, continuing to make sound without my being able to see it when I should have.  The only reason I did not flee in terror until later was because the creature was between me and the only exit.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_12d57t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/12d57t/me_xpost_from_rparanormal_the_scaredest_i_have/,

It was the winter of third grade, and I had begged all that year for a cat. I picked her out from our local animal shelter here in what I call Hicks-ville, Illinois. She had short, but fluffy white fur and a round-ish face. I named her Angel. 

Angel had been with us about a week now. She was super cuddly; always head butting me, begging for pets. 

I remember when I went to bed one night, I grabbed up my fluff ball and brought her into bed with me. I awoke sometime later that night to little foot prints stepping on my tummy, and I was delighted. 

Then I froze. 

Like I mentioned before, Angel was a cuddle-butt that had been with us for a week now. I knew her foot steps. She was a fat cat and it hurt a little when she would walk on me at night, but this cat's paws felt incredibly light.

I cautiously sat up to see angel on the floor, staring at the only corner of the room not illuminated by the street lamps outside. I pulled the cover over my head, hoping to ignore things long enough to fall asleep.

If you don't want a big read 1.2 is all you need but 1.1 will help give it context**

I have a friend who tells classic bs stories and fools around with people's gullibility, but I trust him enough to tell that when he told me this that it is 100% legitimate.  I'm the kind of person who gets really timid from scary stories and themes (I've been browsing these subreddits to try and desensitize the fear) and he told me this strictly because it was true, not just to freak me out.  Ive got a few stories and I'll number them to show their length.

 When I was told all of this I got incredibly scared, but I've tried to retell them to be as PG as possible. The stuff in 1.1-2 arent really scary and the ones in 2.1-3 aren't in the slightest bit scary but I thought the consistency of this events, the fact that my friend who we'll call Mark - alongside the rest of his family have told me identical personal experiences of these events makes them unquestionable to me. 

1.1 - Preface
Before my friend ""Mark"" was born, there was a night where his parents, aunt and other family members were at some kind of event.  They thought it would be fun to play with a Ouija board.  (I know the skepticism behind ouija boards and I don't think they work, but they may make certain entities mad, or interested in certain people).  The story specifics are a little hazy for this bit but the essence is that the board sent some pretty suggestive messages to the Aunty.  It's important to note that this family has No link to religion and are the stereotypical hard working hard drinking heavy music sort of people.  Although I don't know what happened to her, over the next couple of weeks she had a lot of supernatural experiences and after two weeks was forced into an asylum, diagnosed with developing schizophrenia.  After she got out she was baptized and is now a born again Christian, visiting church every Sunday. 

TL;DR: Aunt develops schizophrenia from undefined supernatural experiences and tries to repent them by becoming devoutly religious.

1.2
Several years later, after Mark was 3 or 4 there was an overnight family gathering.  At the end of the house was a long thin room that could comfortably fit 4 double beds with space to walk in and out like a .  All of the beds were filled with various family members and Mark was in a mattress on the floor with his Aunt, and the far end of the room.  His bed faced the opposite end of the room, which had a large window covering the entire wall, showing the moon.  Mark woke up in the middle of the night and sat up to see if anybody was awake.  At the end of the room he saw a set of glowing eyes and could hear a faint ""evil laugh"".  At first he couldn't move or talk and was almost in a state of paralysis.  As the thing move past the window there was full definition of a thin but muscular dark red body, hunched over with a skin appearing to have a scaly texture.  Mark said it had the classic tail and horns of a demon.  It kept eye contact for the whole event, and started slowly walking toward Mark's end of the room, the laugh growing louder.  Only a few seconds after it appeared the 'paralysis' broke and Mark started screaming and shaking his Aunty to wake up but she was dead asleep.  The demon kept getting closer and closer to Mark but as soon as it got about a meter from the foot of the bed it just vanished.  Mark's Aunty woke up to him screaming and sobbing and assuming he was just having nightmares comforted him back to sleep.  In the morning he was trying to describe it to his family and did so by drawing a picture of a demon.  His mum and Dad did the sort of ""awh shit"" thing like they were experienced with it but blew it off for Mark's sake.  Apparently this is exactly what his Aunty had been exposed to which caused her schizophrenia. Even though everybody tried to keep their cool after Mark did his drawing the Aunty burst into tears and broke down.  He tries to dismiss it as a nightmare or a hallucination but he had never seen images or themes of the devil or demons and with the family history it's kind of hard to dismiss.

TL;DR: the demon who stalked Mark's Aunty came back for Mark

2.1
All the ones in 2 should be really short.  Mark is the oldest of three sons, and in one house they lived in had to temporarily all share a room.  There was a bunk bed and a mattress in the room, and Mark had the top bunk.  There was ambient lighting in the room but nothing strong enough to really cause shadows or anything.  One day one of Mark's brothers (probably 8 or 9 at the time) said some really weird stuff had been happening at night and the other brother (probably 5 or 6) sort of piped up and said ""oh really, you've seen that too?"".  Mark (12ish) got them each to tell him what they had seen individually to make sure they weren't lying and the stories matched up with every detail he could ask.  Apparently throughout the night shadows of between 1 and 3 people would appear through the night, and just stand around as if they were having a conversation, signaling the top bunk by pointing or whatever.  After a while they would crawl across the wall, onto the roof and disappear over Mark's bunk.

2.2
In the same house, Mark's mum would wake up in the middle of the night unable to move her body, talk, or breathe.  I know this is easily explained sleep paralysis sort of thing but I thought it'd be worth adding as another unusual event in this house, as the house itself seemed to be carrying some weird stuff.

2.3
One night Mark's uncle who is a boxer and his girlfriend were staying over at the house.  The house is two story and has a punching bag hanging on the first floor and when you really get into it the whole house can shake around.  That night the whole house was shaking like when somebody's using the punching bag, for about 30 seconds.  It wasn't really looked into at the time because it might have just been the uncle unable to sleep and unaware of how disruptive it is.  Long story short in the morning it turns out he slept through the whole night and isn't known for sleepwalking.  The punching bag isn't out in the open for somebody to just come in the middle of the night, it's in a sort of rumpus room which was locked.

TL;DR for this entire post - Mark's family is either over exagerbating, really good at fooling me, or seriously fucked.

He told me about a witches grave. One that was in a weird spot, it was in the center of two rows right at the edge by the fence. He said he's seen a white haired woman walking around at night. 

Anyway, we go and pick up Holly and tell her we're going to go check out a graveyard and that's it. No further details given. She was intrigued and wanted to go. Well, we get there and start walking around and Holly starts to grip my arm, typical girlfriend stuff. Then we get near the alleged witch grave. Again, only me and Josh know of this. Holly stops and digs her fingers into my arm and just stands there, she refuses to move and is just staring at this grave. I manage to get her off my arm and she starts crying and begs for us to leave. Josh says he's staying for a little while longer, so Holly and I walk back to my car. She goes to light up a cigarette with her trembling hands and tears in her face and then she just turns her head out of the window of my car and vomits. 

After I get her back home and get her in bed and take care of her for a little bit, Josh calls me to have him come intercept him when he walks home. Josh then explains to me that Holly might be very, very sensitive to paranormal stuff. He says she may be a medium of some kind or something.

1338821146.0,10,self.Thetruthishere,uk8tg,[ME] Looking for input on a life long experience thus far (lengthy read),thisguychris,16,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/uk8tg/me_looking_for_input_on_a_life_long_experience/,"Ill try and do my best to keep this easy to follow. You may want to refill your coffee on this one.

Im nearly 29 years old now. And since about the age of 7 or 8, I have had what are to me, paranormal experiences. 
 Just a short background: Between 6 and 18, there was a handful of tragic deaths on my mothers side of the family. Primarily my mother, who took her own life when I was 6, and my uncle who suffered fatal injuries from a motorcycle accident on the way to visit his sister who was in labor with her newest child. Both being my closest family members. 

Since the passing of my mother, I spent a lot of time visiting her cemetery and just talking, as if she could hear me. Shortly after she was gone, I started to experience things in my fathers home. Dishes dropping, all of the cabinets opening, etc. Pretty basic stuff. Now I've discussed this matter with a few individuals in the past about the logic of what I've experienced, and the cemetery seems to be the most feasible explanation. But I am looking to Reddit for other possible answers.

  It was suggested that something came home with me one of the times I visited. What leads me to believe that something came with me, is that regardless of what house we lived in, what state we moved to, the same exact types of things would happen.  Being kind of creeped out, I asked various members of my family if anything else like this has ever happened since my mom or Jeff (uncle) passed. According to my grandmother on my mothers side, paranormal visions, or experiences are pretty common place in our family. The females claim to have a sort of connection in a way they can't explain. Always knowing when something happens, knowing one or the other is hurt, sick, etc.  But none of them explained having the actual physical interaction of a spirit. 

Now I believe that I've experienced my mother as well as my uncle. The energy and feeling when experiencing these spirits have been entirely different than what I am about to detail. You know when you are protected and in the presence of a caring spirit. What I have experienced in the last 2 decades have been anything but pleasant.

It started with a feeling that you aren't alone, when you were alone. The feeling that something intimidating was in your presence. I would notice what appeared to be a shadow on a wall near me several times a day, usually in a place there was no possible light source to produce this shadow. I would always see it out of the corner of my eye, and when I would look it would be there long enough for me to see it for a few seconds before fading out. I started to pay more attention to this as a teenager, and started seeking out answers. Once I started digging, then things got a little more, aggressive, would be the word I suppose. Objects started moving, often being flung from their location. I started experiencing sleep paralysis, and then eventually seeing a faint outline of a face in various parts of my house/apartment. I've felt hands on me while in the shower or bath, or on my back while I lay in bed. Normally felt as if someone was slightly shoving you. I started to get the feeling that whatever was around me, wasn't very happy or positive. I felt as if the more scared I became, the more active it was. And the more I tried to figure it out, the angrier it became. 

Side story: Having been on the topic of ghosts and the paranormal with my other close Aunt one night, we started talking about my mom. We've all had our e My Aunt came to the house with my father, where my mother died just that same day. What my aunt described to me not only chilled my bones, but brought instant tears to my eyes. My aunt described walking into the house and feeling dread. They went into the garage where my sister and I had a massive pile of laundry, where they could get our clothes. My aunt described in detail, feeling and seeing a dark shadow in the corner of the garage where my mothers body was found. Up to that point I had never told my aunt about what I've seen. 

Another side story: I took it upon myself to bring a psychic medium to my apartment, in Alexandria, Virginia at the time, after her claiming to see a darkness over me, watchig ( a gf wanted us to get our palms read..) I made an appointment and had the woman come to my building. Upon arriving at my apartment door, she was hesitant in opening the door. Reaching her hand back she decided that she needed to go and that her help couldn't be offered. Now this sounds like some movie shit at this point, and I really couldn't grasp what was happening any more.  I backed off from trying to figure it out and things calmed down for some time. Only recently (last couple of years) have the ""not alone"" feelings started to creep back up, and things and sounds starting to appear again.

Not a single person in my family was negative in any way toward me, had hostile feelings, etc. I'm not sure why I'm being trolled by this unruly spirit. Like I mentioned above, I feel that something came home with me one day. Thats the only thing that makes sense to me. I ask you Reddit, WTF could this be? 

TL:DR :  I've been seeing/experiencing paranormal activity since a young age, feeling a negative and aggressive attachment by an entity of some kind. Many deaths in the family but no negative history with any family members. ghost why u troll me??",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_uk8tg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/uk8tg/me_looking_for_input_on_a_life_long_experience/,

I'll just name a few instances. When I was 6-7 I would often stay home alone. My parents would be at work and my siblings had extra-curricular activities so I would end up keeping myself occupied with something. Well that same day, I heard all the doors open as I laid in bed. (The house was pretty old so I didn't think anything of it). What I heard next was a creepy whisper, it sounded faint, but I don't recall what the voice said. I, for some reason shrugged it off.

Another instance, I had this vivid dream where there was an overweight nurse around the 20s-30s in usual nurse attire. I was sent there to check up on her, so I stood by her and her patients. She had dark hair and piercing green eyes. She wore thick red lipstick and stained teeth. Well throughout the dream she would kill her patients ""gracefully"", and I would try to tell someone but everywhere I turned I saw her image. Well, she killed one and I heard screaming, as I awoke from my nightmare she was hovering right above me. I laid still for a few moments, as she whispered into my ear, I tried to push her off of me.

This was fairly recent. A friend of mine and I were bored one day and decided to enter whatever place we came up to next. Sure enough, it was the local cemetery. We got off the car and inspected the area. A sense of calmness filled the air around us. We walked, which seemed like only seconds, maybe minutes, until we gazed at the time, we had been there for a few hours. We watched the tombstones and the trees that surrounded them. As we walked around, (the circle/trail), we felt someone behind us, mimicking our steps. We both brushed it off. That is, until my friend had the bright idea of asking if anyone was there to tap me on the shoulder. I laughed it off as we both walked to the car. He opened the door to his side of the car and as I approached the passenger's side, I felt a tap on my right shoulder that seemed to brush my hair away from me. I stared at my friend, the car was silent...for awhile. As we were driving we heard a loud noise coming from behind my seat. (There wasn't anything there.) We both sort of half-smiled and laughed. We later grab something to eat and notice how uneasy we both were feeling. As our food arrived, my food seemed to be shoved away. Maybe it was a coincidence but wherever my food fell, it was as far as possible from me, it was much closer to my friend who also noted it. We later end up studying for our exams so I go to his house to pick up something. We're talking in his dining room, I go to greet his mother and continue on. From the corner of both our eyes we both gazed at this shadow that followed us. We automatically looked at one another and back at the photos that it seemed to vanish from. Needless to say, it was an awkward day.

This one happened while I still lived in my old house. I was around 8-9 when I would be trying to sleep. I had a queen's sized bed that I would sleep in whenever we had company over so my sister would also have to share with me. Anyway, this was late one night. I saw a moving object directly in front of my mirror. (The mirror is right in front of the bed so whenever I would wake up I could see my reflection.) I felt groggy as I emerged from my bed. I saw what seemed to be a small woman, so I instinctively thought it was my sister brushing her hair. It was odd, but I didn't really question it. Until I TAPPED IT to see what she was doing. ""What are you doing?"" I asked, expecting it to be my sister. My sister responded from the foot of her bed; snoring. The image tilted its head. It was dark and she had no skin, it was bare with stickly hair. Like the hair you would see on an old rag doll. All I remember was hopping in to bed and just closing my eyes as hard as I could to remove that image from my mind.
I'll post some more, if I feel the need to give more detail.

ETA: This again, happened at my old house. I lived in it from ages 3-12. One of my dogs (a small poodle) was sleeping at the foot of my bed as I was reading. I had left the door open so the dog could leave if he felt the need to during the night. The bathroom is in the center, to the left of the door I left open, so if anyone would pass by I could see who it was. Anyway, I was petting my dog as he was stretching about and I stopped for a moment. Both my dog and I saw a brisk shadow speed to the bathroom. My dog leaped from my bed and chased it; as did I. By the time I reached the door to the bathroom it slammed in my face. I turned the door handle, expecting there to be someone in dire need of a bathroom break; but nothing. Nothing at all. All I remember is curling up with my dog as we both fell asleep. Though, this might have nothing to do with it, sometimes both my dogs would bark at the air; maybe their just bored, I don't know.

P.S. another occurrence:  I'm not sure if this one is evil or not, but here goes. When I was about 8-9, (still living in my old house), I woke up to something rumbling down the kitchen. I left my bed and headed down the hallway to where the kitchen was. I just remember seeing a dark shadow or ball of gas/orb with red eyes. It sort of shook, from an angle it looked like it danced in thin air, all the while I'm staring at it befuddled.

According to Tyler, he woke up in the middle of the night to see a tall black figure standing over him. Tyler thought it was my brother, so he asked him ""What's up?""

I'm looking for input here; any ideas, theories, or even idle speculation would be appreciated. Please also note that while some of this is about dreams, this is not a ""dream post.""

  This all started last year, when I was living alone in a dorm. It was a very snowy winter, and I was very sick. So I had been cooped up in my dorm room for about a week, not seeing anyone, eating only what I had on hand, not even going to class. And during this week, I had nightmares every single night. I have nightmares a lot, but these were extremely consistent. They always involved me being in a forest, and there was always the exact same monster-type thing. The beast was very tall, possibly nine or ten feet. It wore a black robe, and its arms were disproportionately long. The arms hanged down to about where its knees would be. It wore a black robe which covered its entire body except for its head. The head looked like a cow skull with deer antlers, and it wore a laurel of purple flowers. In some dreams a ghostly bluish-white light shone from its empty eye sockets, and in some dreams it would breathe out a single, stale breath, with a few dead leaves coming out from where its mouth would be. Every time I saw it all I could feel was abject, utter terror. It made noises, very very low, rumbling sort of noises, but they were measured enough that I could tell it was some kind of language. I could understand it, not in the sense that I knew the words, but it was like my subconscious mind or something was getting the gist of what it was saying. And it wanted to hurt me. 

  I had the dreams for about eight days, and on the eighth day I was finally feeling less ill. I also had to go to a recital for a class that day, and as it was snowing less, I decided I may as well go. So I went to grab my good pen (which I took to take notes on the recital, because we had to write a paper about it), and I noticed it wasn't where I usually left it. I groggily searched my tiny dorm, not finding it anywhere. Finally a opened a desk drawer, and I nearly had a heart attack. There was my pen-- next to a drawing of that fucking monster. Next to the monster were some Greek letters, some Cyrillic letters, and a few made-up symbols. I must have drawn it in my sleep. To be fair, I do many things in my sleep: talk, very rarely I'll walk, scream, and one time I responded (poorly) to a text message. But this drawing was good by my standards, as I'm a shit artist when it comes to drawing. I still have the sketch, and I'll try to post a link if I can figure out Imgur.

  This isn't even the really weird part. A few days later I was back in class, and I related my story (which I told as a humorous anecdote to hide how frightened it actually made me) to a girl that sat next to me that I was friendly with. As I described the monster at the end, the blood drained from her face. She told me that she had had nightmares about the same creature when she was a little girl, and when she told her grandmother about them, she (the grandmother) just nodded and said that that was what the Devil looked like. For my part, I don't think that this the devil or a demon or a fallen angel, but it's weird that her grandmother knew immediately what this was. This girl had no reason to lie to me. Fast-forward a year, and I'm relating the story to my friend James. I can see fear in his eyes; he, too, had had dreams about this whatever-it-was. What. The. Fuck. 

  So that's about it. Anyone know what this is? Any ideas? My best guess is that this is some sort of weird genetic-memory representation of fear. Or something. I'm not even sure what I mean by that. 

  I've been messing with Imgur for the past hour, and I guess I'm too dumb to figure it out. I do have the drawing, though. I'll try to upload it later.

One large bedroom with a huge bathroom, and then on the opposite side of the ""double wide house"" two smaller bedrooms with a bathroom near them as well.  The whole house can be walked around outside in less than about 2 minutes, and inside, it's only 20 steps from my bed on the farthest side of the room to across the house and into the baby's room and her crib, on the other farthest wall. 

Despite the size, we told him we'll take it, paid our deposit and began moving things in.  First things first we drop off our cat, Bu, so she can get a feel for the place.  I put her food bowl next to the master bathroom sink and turned the water onto a slow trickle, just the way she's always liked it.  I moved the drain stopper out of the sink and put it by the light switch about 2 feet away and we headed out to pick up our first load of boxes.

A few hours later when we get back we find Bu in the living room, looking very spooked - which for her was odd, because she was a very resilient cat that wasn't bothered by much at all.  We walk into the master bedroom and the floor is soaking wet.  I walk into the bathroom and notice that the stopper is in the sink and that the whole bathroom and half the bedroom are flooded because the sink ran over.  It ran over a lot, more than I thought it should have for how strongly I left the water on, but I just shrug, unplug and put the stopper back by the light switch again.  We throw open windows, pull out a fan and get to work drying that half of the house out as we begin moving boxes and small pieces of furnitures in.  

That very first night, we slept on some large body pillows on the living room floor, it was uncomfortable with my huge belly and active baby, but what made things stranger was the smell of the place.  In the day time, it smelled very nice, the pine trees and flowers outside left a lovely lingering scent in the house, but as the water dried up, it began to smell... off.  I told my husband but he shrugged it off to ""pregnancy nose"" and rolled over.  Bu however seemed to agree and she made a point of sleeping between me and the master bedroom that night, purring as loudly as her tiny self could.

The next day the smell of the house had shifted back to the nice earthy scents of the world outside.  Bu found her leash and I took her out with us when we went for the second load, but we decided in the car ride to pick up more of our stuff that we'd sleep at my husband's mother's house that night.  We spent a few weeks  moving things into the house, getting boxes put in the proper rooms and getting some of the furniture moved in.  I wasn't much of a help being 8 months pregnant, but I did my best to lend a hand, and Bu enjoyed being on her leash outside in the sun and grass, or chilling in the AC at my mother-in-law's.

We loved the house, despite a few strange things in the master bathroom and elsewhere.  For example, the faux woodgrain doors in the bathroom had pretty creepy shapes and faces in the design.  They'd stare out at you as you used the toilet, and the door to the linen closet in the bathroom is less than three feet from the toilet, so you can't really escape looking at the door.  Also, something about the lighting in the bathroom would play tricks on your eyes.  It seemed at times that the floor was SWARMING with ants.  Now, if the carpet was brown or something, it'd not be so bad, but our carpet is this lovely ocean blue, so when you look at your feet (to avoid looking at the creepy door) you'd see a swarm of ants.  Not pleasant living in The South where fire ants are prevalent and have a bad habit of trying to invade human space.  However, it wasn't ever really regular, and there weren't ever any ants, so we just chalked it up to being strange, and then found staring at the wall was far more pleasant than either of the other options.

Fast forward a few months.  We have a brand new baby, only a few months old.  She's been keeping us up, so our sleep schedule is way off.  Since the air vents in the house are toward the inside walls, all the beds are forced to the outside of the rooms leaving a perfect line of sight from the edge of our bed into the main bathroom, and the bath tub.  I call to my husband as he's changing for bed to grab something from the bedroom for me and he waved at me as an acknowledgment.  Out of the corner of his eye he saw a black shape ""peek"" at him from the bathtub.  He grinned and waved at it, thinking it's Bu playing ""peek-a-boo"" in the tub with him.  When he comes back into the living room he sees where Bu is laying, in my lap, and the baby is sleeping in her swing.He related the story to me with a bit of a laugh, but we were a bit spooked so we slept on the couch that night.

A year or so later we start having this issue.  It's a knocking sound.  At first my husband says it's something with the AC unit outside.  Then he claims it's something to do with the way the air comes on, some suction or another thing like that.  We disagree, because the knocking isn't ever in the same place, and generally has nothing to do with the heating and cooling in our house.  Bu seems to be on my side, forever stalking something in the house, watching, then giving up and coming to get as much attention as she can.  At this point the baby is walking, and we've added another cat to the household.  Eventually the other cat gets blamed for the knocking, but I know that I had seen Noodle playing with the baby in her room when the knocking was coming from the kitchen.
He checked under the house to no avail, and the ducts were clean as well after a check with flashlights and mirrors.

We take matters into our own hands, I begin making medicine bundles and my husband gathers up all the small mirrors he can find.  I place the little bundles all over the house, he puts mirrors in every windowsill.  The creepy feelings, knocking, and shadows seem to go away, so we relax.

Our child grows, our family grows.  Another cat, another baby.  The activity kicks up again, and our oldest daughter won't sleep in her room because ""it's scary in there, something whispers.""  We let her stay in our room, and our bed is full with cats and kids.  We try hard to get the whispering to stop, I smudge the room with medicines, placing medicine bundles in every place I can.  More mirrors are added to the single windowsill as well as one on the wall where our oldest can't reach it.  We buy her a fancy canopy bed and make it like a tent, telling her that she's safe in there, that nothing can get her.  She sleeps in there twice, but the whispers are worse now, and part of the wall seems to be rotting.

We called the landlord, asked him to fix the rotting walls, but he only fixed the outside walls, not the inside ones.  The whispering quieted down, but didn't leave.  We kept working at the problem, asking friends and family, even our local minister what to do, but nothing really made a large difference.  The cats seem to only walk into the room long enough to turn around and leave just as quickly as the entered, and until our oldest turned 5, she wouldn't sleep in her room no matter what we did.

Then, things quieted down for a bit, as if all the strangeness leaked out of the house.  Life seemed so good, happy.  Both girls would play in their room, the cats would sleep the day away, waiting for them to come home from school on their babies beds.  I never got that eerie feeling anywhere in the house.

Then, we all started getting really sick.  Sinus infections, strange viruses, insomnia followed by periods of almost overwhelming lethargy.  No one had the same issue at the same time, and medications began accumulating.  Extra strength cough syrups, super decongestants, antibiotics, sleeping pills, anti anxiety meds, things to prevent depression, and more.   The problems keep happening though, the whispering is gone, but the rotting inside and outside came back.  We called again, and our landlord sent people out to replace the whole outside repaint it.  The men who worked on it said it looks like termites, but the wood is almost black, not full of holes, and the inside seems to be eating itself away.  

Bu had a heart attack and passed on a few years ago, since then things have been getting even worse.  The girls sleep in the same room and some nights they wake up screaming from night terrors.  Other nights, before they can even get to sleep, they complain of nightmares.

We own the place now, but it turns out that since the original owners died in the place and the paperwork wasn't filled out properly, we don't possess the proper papers to get this place torn down and something new put here.

Two buddies and myself were hanging out in the garage one night when we noticed a certain star seemed to be flickering very brightly and shifting colors. I can't say this had any connection to what we saw next, but it was very odd and it was the reason we we're staring up in the first place. After a while of watching the star flare up, we moved into the front yard and noticed another star was blinking similarly. It was at this time that I noticed something in the sky. I only glanced at it at first, thinking it was a bird, but my glance caused one of my friends to look up and i snapped my head back with the sudden realization that the ""bird"" I had glanced at seemed to be two masses instead of one. The masses were light-grey and oval and seemed way too close to each other and too large to be birds (maybe pelicans but we're not that close to the sea). Small wings came off both sides, but seemed to join in between them. No head was visible at the front end of the oval (defiantly not pelicans). The wings did not appear to move, but the object glided along at around 30 or 40mph, or at least a fast speed for a bird. It was gliding about the height of the telephone poles plus another half pole. It passed directly over us and shortly after, both masses appeared to turn in and combine into a V shape, all the while keeping the exact same trajectory and speed. They separated, then turned back in towards each other and formed the V shape again. About this time me and my friends all look at each other and start freaking the fuck out. I wouldn't write this if it wasn't true. I've told people this story and got crazy looks but I don't care because its true. I know I wasn't hallucinating because my friends saw the exact same thing, otherwise I don't know if I would believe my own eyes. Has anyone ever had a similar sighting because I've never heard of anything like this. Probably doesn't sound that scary but that night really rocked my perceptions of reality.

Btw, I welcome all debunking...I've tried my hardest, but i can't seem to rationalize what we saw. I know it can be hard to tell the size of something in the sky without anything to reference it to, but it wasn't that high up. Pelicans are the only large birds anywhere near my area, but these seemed big even for pelicans, and as I mentioned did not have the large bills of a pelican or even a noticeable head!",,False,,t5_2sntx,True,,,True,t3_k4qax,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/k4qax/strange_gliding_object_xpost_from_rnosleep/,

It is also not the creepeiest of my experiences but the most historical.

Just outside the city of Lublin, Poland is Majdanek concentration camp. 

My friends and I decided to check it out around Halloween. We hopped on the bus in the mid-morning, the only time of day that it is really light (the sun sets around 3 p.m.).
We arrive and there is a large [stone entrance](http://faculty.berea.edu/gowlers/remembering/majdanek/main_monument.jpg). We snapped some pictures and made our way inside. 

Most of it is a large field with a few rows of guard towers and cabins.  Off in the distance is a large memorial which is filled with the ashes of the victims.

We walk into the first building. It contains cans of Zyklon B and remnants of a gassing room. It smells putrid. No one says a word as they walk through. I'm the only one with a camera and make my way through faster than everyone else. I go outside to take a couple of pictures. 

I set my camera bag outside and set it on a large stone that is resting in the grass. I turn to the corner of the building and take a picture. I begin to turn back around and pick up my camera bag.  As I'm turning, the bag is flung towards me and hits me in the shoulder. There was obviously no one else around to take the bag, and I don't have any physical explanation of how a 2 pound bag can be lifted and thrown 5-10 feet.

I'm very creeped out at this point, pick up the bag and go back to my group of friends. I say nothing to them. 

We make our way to another building. The only source of light is from the sunlight peeping in from the open door.  Inside are columns of 10-foot high containers containing nothing more than shoes. The room past a few feet is pitch dark.

All of a sudden we hear children's laughter coming from the back. None of us can see anything but assume that it is a kid who was there with his parents (a safe assumption as there were a decent amount of people there).  We finish up and start to leave when one of my friends says that no one left the building and the laughter and noise continued.  I engaged the flash on my camera in hopes of seeing something.  Nothing.  I make my way down the rows and the laughter gets closer.  I make it to the end... nothing.

We continued through the camp and make it to the back. In the back is the oven (it's purpose, obvious) and the memorial which I mentioned earlier.

As we leave the oven and head towards the memorial we all begin to hear singing. It was a low toned song. Somewhat like the singing you would hear slaves singing. It lacked happiness.

My Polish friend walks over to a group of Polish people and ask if they heard it too. They said that it was common and could be heard as far as the houses in the area. 

People have asked if all of the city is haunted.  It seems to me that, because of it's history, there is definitely a spiritual/paranormal presence that lingers.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_jn74y,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/jn74y/majdanek_concentration_camp_xpost_from_rnosleep/,

I'm going into my fourth year of studying in Poland (thankfully my last).  I began school in October of 2008.

The city of Lublin is relatively small. Most of it's population is students (there are 4 or 5 universities there). The beginnings of the our school years (the Polish students don't start yet) are quiet. The only people there are the year-round population -- mostly old people with a sprinkling of a younger generation. 

My first year of studies (pre-med) was pretty boring and simple.  My mind would wander and I was always searching for something to do -- our only non-night club amenities are a movie theater and a bowling alley.

By Halloween we were all looking for something to do and the frightening nature of the holiday set in.  From a Polish friend (born there but grew up in the U.S. who attended school with me in the American Program) we learned of Majdanek and the surrounding cemetery.  In Poland Halloween is celebrated by paying respect to family members that have passed.

Halloween night rolls around and a group of 5 us decide to go check it out. We hop in a cab (our only night-time method of transportation) and head out to the cemetery.  As we drive up the haunting glow of thousands of candles (for the holiday) littered the grounds and gave the area an eerie glow.

We get to the entrance and there is a small barrier keeping us out and we hop over it. We walk around and stop at random grave sites, reading names and dates of death. Many were from the early 1940s and we assumed them to be victims of war or the concentration camp.  A feeling of dread fell over all of us. This was without a doubt (with combination of the concentration camp), the most depressing place I have ever been.

We continue to walk and eventually we come across an area that is the burial grounds for children. There is a sudden sound of a branch snapping from a tree. I hear it hurdling towards my head and I quickly skirt out of the way. We pass it off as wind but in the back of all of our mind's we knew there was none.

One of us recommends that we start heading back to the entrance and then the dorms. We all quickly agree. As we are walking back, the candles around us start going out (mind you there is no wind, and these things are covered and rarely go out until the wax is done). There is a circle of unlit candles around us and it continues to grow. We all freeze.

Within 30 seconds the entire field which was once lit by these thousands of candles goes dark. Every one was out. We smell death. It's the smell of decay and burnt flesh. One of the girls begins to cry and we try our best to reassure her.

We didn't know what to do so we very slowly started tip-toeing towards the entrance (a good quarter-mile away).  In hindsight, I don't know why we were walking so slow...it would have been a better idea to run. My friend Wojciech and I tell the other 3 that we are going to go ahead and call a cab and instruct the others to wait there,

We leave the group and get about 300 yards away and we hear shouting. We turn around and our friends are trying to get our attention. A circle of candles around them had lit back up. My friend and I are still in darkness. We are close to the entrance and decide to go the rest of the way.

All of a sudden the both of us are shoved apart, I to the left and him to the right. We were both thrown air-borne and I smash my knee against a headstone. Warm blood starts streaking down my leg. I get up and ask him if he is okay. He looks at me, pupils dilated, and nods. We hear whispering, too faint to understand. It sounds like a chant, the same thing repeated over and over.

The whispering turns to shouting. It is booming and we are certain anyone in the area can hear it.

We both make eye contact and sprint towards the entrance and jump over the stone fence. The streetlights are comforting but our friends are still inside. We call them and tell them to come up front. About 10 minutes later we hear them shuffling towards us.

They ask me what happened to my leg and I tell them.  They heard no shouting. They tell us that as soon as we left that the candles around them had re-lit.  

The cab arrives 10 minutes later and we hop inside.  As we drive back, I stare out the window into the woods. We slowed down for a bit and just beyond the tree line there are 6 sets of eyes staring back at me. We drive off again and I'm relieved. It began to rain.

I will post another shorter story about my experiences at the actual concentration camp later today or tomorrow.

It was either a Saturday or a Sunday, traveling West on I-8. We see signs for an Indian reservation promising unique landmarks and tons of local history. Nothing else to do, and it sounded interesting, we exit the interstate to the north.

Driving around we check out the sights. Half an hour later we are horrendously lost. There is one obvious solution. South, we go south. Assuming we hadn't managed to travel well into Arizona somehow I-8 would be there for us.

Twenty minutes later we drive through a small... I don't know what to call it. The houses looked like somebody had plucked a small community out of the suburbs and plopped them down in the high desert. Six houses, clustered together as closely as in any planned community, lawns more green and perfect than they had any right to be. Everything uniform as if the home owners association would sweep down at any moment to exact vengeance on pesky individualists. Two of the houses stood out due to the expensive looking play sets assembled in back, but that was it.

Though there were cars in the driveway there was not a sign of life. No children, dogs, cats, or even insects. Nobody mowing the manicured green lawns, no sprinklers going, no signs of life anywhere. The feeling that we had somehow accidentally driven onto a staged set, combined with the fact that we should have reached (Not even half the thirty minutes earlier had been spent driving north, most of it was east.) the interstate several minutes ago did not help matters any.

Two rights should take us back to the reservation. On the way out town we passed a cow. No insects circled it, it did not seek shade, it's tail didn't even swish in the heat. It may as well have been a statue, a carving in stone, but it wasn't.

If you don't know about the Borden house, it was the sight of the Borden family murders, where Lizzie Borden was the prime suspect in the murder of her Father and stepmother, this place is widely considered the most haunted place in america. My plan was to do the overnight stay that the staff offers to guests of the house, but first to get a tour. going through the house, we did hear a few sounds, but they were easy to explain, walls shifting, house settling, after all, the house is very old. When we went in the room that Lizzie's father was found hacked to pieces, we heard something unnatural. Mind you I only brought a camera and a tape recorder because It was my first investigation and I hadn't gotten any paranormal gear. What we heard in that room sounded like quiet sobbing, my recorder has the evidence, The sobbing was loud enough for the recorder to pick up and loud enough to spook the tour guide. I was exhilarated from having my first encounter, but also very uneasy about what awaited me later that night. at about 8:00 that night, I decided to go to bed, afraid of what I may see; after a half an hour of laying in bed, I finally dozed off. when I awoke, I saw a small bit of sunlight coming through the window, and concluded that I had missed any good activity that could have happened that night. as I was getting up, I noticed that one of the corners of the room was extremely dark compared to the rest of the room, I wrote it off, because the sun wasn't fully up yet, and the room was still considerably dark. as I was getting up to collect my items and prepare to leave, I noticed that the darkness in the corner never subsided even when the sun was fully up, as I looked closer, I realized that it wasn't darkness, it was a translucent figure of a man. I was in total shock; at the last moment, I tried to get my camera and take a picture, but I was too late, the figure disappeared; at that point I was ready to leave the house and never look back.

Through discussions and threads, I've noticed a lot of contributors are (at least to some extent) medium's* or display some psychic ability. That being said, I have my own power to share; simply stated, empathy. In the truest sense of the word, understanding, but more so feeling, peoples emotions...In some circumstances it displays itself in a manner that seems psychic (even schizophrenic), but I love this ability that over the years I have fine tuned and prioritized. I use the term ""empath"" because I read it once upon a time and it makes the most sense. If there is another like me, please come forward, I'd like to meet you.

Since then, I have made acquaintance with some very cool Empath's and other 3rd party people with interest on the topic. It's great and I've been feeling much better as a whole because of it. I don't want to shut this thread down, but since discovering /r/empathetic , I'd really like to become an active member of that community. Hopefully a lot of you guys will come too and we can continue the discussion there where I'll be submitting my first post. I'll come back for a second edit with the link to the specific thread.

It's probably beneficial for this to be read first so the rest of this post makes sense.

As you may have read, I expressed some frustration and self-doubt with the fact that my sister, Chels, does NOT remember the encounter despite the fact it was so etched into my brain.

Just recently I was talking to my other sister, Erica, about reddit. I'm still pretty new to the world of reddit, so I brought it up as topic of conversation. I was most likely telling her about /spacedicks or something like that. Later on I mentioned some of the subreddits I like to read during downtime at work and naturally this one came up. 

I kind of offhandedly mentioned the story I posted about the UFO sighting me and Chels had and kind of brushed it off because even in front of my own flesh and blood I feel silly telling a story that seems so unbelievable. 

I wasn't really expected her to probe me for details, but she did. So I gave her the whole run down almost playing it off like ""Oh it's no big deal"". But as I get further into the story her eyes widen, and she's just like ""What. The. Fuck"". So naturally I'm like ""What??"". She looks at me with this really freaked out look on her face and says ""Dude, that wasn't Chels you were with, that was ME"". She was able to finish my story to a T. She took the words right out of my mouth and recounted the story exactly how I remember. 

Since we're triplets I'm used to outsiders getting us mixed up, but I got my own sisters mixed up with each other. I'm not going crazy after all!

We spent the next few minutes absolutely reeling over this revelation. I was a combination of relieved that I was not, in fact, crazy and making up memories but also horrified to confirm that was we saw was true. 

Unfortunately though for Erica, her experience ended up a lot more horrifying than mine.  She recounted that for YEARS after we saw what we did she would have reoccurring nightmares about being abducted by aliens, dreams that didn't seem like ordinary dreams, dreams that seemed *too* real. She recalls snapping out of sleep and seeing things out of the corners of her eyes and such. I'm not at all disputing the fact that they very well could be your average night terrors from a traumatic experience, that could very well explain the ""dreams"", but I thought it would be important to include that tid bit.

I tried to probe her more about these ""dreams"" but I could tell she was REALLY scared over the whole thing and made it very clear that she did not want to talk about it anymore. I could see it in her eyes that this has really affected her over the years and I almost feel bad for being the one to confirm that I did, in fact, see exactly what she saw. 

Not too much later I brought it up to my little brother, and although he wasn't there to see that big craft with lights, he has memories of us screaming to my parents trying to explain what we saw. He says his memories were extremely vague, but when I started talking about it he looked at me like something clicked in his head.

I thought everyone who related to my story would appreciate this update. Thanks for reading.

It 2 days before halloween, it was god awful hot ( Living in Aus) and I really found it hard to sleep. I put some music on, just to fall asleep to. 

Maybe 5 minutes into putting the music on, I felt a strange bubbling sensation under the skin of my shoulder, it didn't hurt but it felt so odd, After that I felt as if someone turned heater on, my head felt weird, like it felt kinda compressed, for lack of a better term. All this happened while 
the music was playing but I couldn't hear it properly, despite it being right next my bed, but during the song Lonesome town, with so much clarity I heard "" I'm coming to get you"" Which evidently isn't part of the song, and I doubt I could have misheard it. I felt horrified, but also depressed, more so than normal, after that I just fell asleep. 

The night after was similar, the bubbling feeling the uncomfortable heat, the music, but this time I felt someone grab my shoulder and whisper something, I believe he said ""you"" but i could be wrong, but at anyrate still spooky. 

I deducted from the last 2 nights that when I play music some spirit or whatevers get pissed off or something and fucks with me and the bubbling shoulder is I guess pre-warning. The night after spooky ghost talking I played the music again, and similar thing, Shoulder, heat, depressed, feeling watched.
Don't know what ""it is"" but as far as I can gather it hangs out around my, brand new, house. Like I hear things in the night, those feelings that someones outside your door, even voices, conversations coming from places around the house at night, I guess music just real pisses it off.

That was the last time I played music to sleep.

But it's this same friend that also had a few encounters in her own house that i got to experience as well.

To start off her house was built around the 1880s, on top of what used to be an old railroad till they ripped it up and moved a few miles down the road. It's a two apartment house, her mother owns the whole place but rents the other half to a black lady who is rarely home.

Anyways my friend informed me that when she was around 11 that she would be visited in the night by a ghostly gentleman, dressed much like a butler, who would just stand at the foot of her bed and not really do much else. Her older sister who too lived in the house but years before was visited by the same man, and they were both quite shocked when they described the same entity, i never saw him, but here's where i come in.

A week ago we were eating dinner and just discussing when she brings up that she heard two men whispering loudly in the attic though she could not make out what it was, and the attic is only reachable by a very tight staircase and is quite cramped up there. We get bored and go for a ride up state (Delaware for anyone who is curious) and get home around 2am. We go up stairs and get in bed together and she falls right to sleep, i stay up messing with my phone till about 2:25am when i heard a man talking from up in the attic. The house i know is locked up tight and it went on for about 5 minutes though i couldnt make anything out and said fuck it, closed my eyes and went to sleep. I told her the next morning and she didn't believe at first until she saw how white i was and how serious i was being.

A few days ago were sitting in her livingroom at around 7pm and we start hearing what sound like furniture on hardwood (both sides have hardwood) being moved, someone walking around though sporadically like skipping rooms. We go upstairs and listen in freaking the fuck out and holding each other, and this goes on for about 10 more minutes. As previously mention the woman who lives on that half is rarely home, and this is one of the instances in which she wasn't, her car wasn't out front or out back and once things quieted down we walked outside and that half of the house was completely unlit. We opted to stay at my house that night.

I've only started staying at her place for about a month now and so far two instances of occurred where i can't explain what is going on and neither can she. I will update if/when more things happen, I will still stay there but god damn am i hesitant to.

**A Couple Of My Creepy Experiences**

It was a late night, I busted out some more homework but this time, I was working on the kitchen table by the sliding door.  Everyone was asleep and I had the kitchen light on.  I was working diligently for nearly 2 hours when I began to feel a very powerful uneasy feeling.  Have you ever stepped in a room and immediately sensed that you shouldn't be there?  People talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time, this is what I felt like.  Unfortunately, I had no where else to go to finish my assignment so I turned up my music and kept working.

It wasn't long before I started hearing footsteps around me.  I couldn't decipher where they were coming from, next to me, behind me.....above me?  I took off my headphones and listened.  Nothing.  The footsteps stopped.  As soon as I put my headphones back in it was like they started stomping around so I could hear them through my music.  I started getting freaked out and turned off my music altogether.  The footsteps stopped.  I walked toward the living room, still feeling the dread and tension in the atmosphere.  The footsteps started again....they were matching my movement into the living room.

This was highly confusing to me because The only rooms upstairs were my cousins' rooms and a bathroom, those were located exactly above the laundry room, the kitchen, and the space to the left of the front door.  No matter where I went in the house, I could hear the footsteps following my direction from above.  There wasn't a floor above the kitchen table or living room, these were extended high ceilings.  The footsteps started turning into stomping/scurrying.  I got so scared I packed all my stuff and booked it out of there.  I ended up spending the night at a friends house.

Another time when my aunt and cousins were on a cruise for the week, I was left at the house alone.  Since I didn't really like being there alone that much I ended up working over time that week and always brought workout clothes with me so I could play volleyball after work until it got dark.  I had just finished playing volleyball and was on my way back home to shower and was planning on spending the rest of the night watching movies in the living room.  As I unlocked the front door and opened it, I got the same dreadful feeling.  Something about the vast open layout of the house was very intimidating, like the space and darkness would swallow you whole.  I decided I would quickly shower and maybe call some friends to see if they wanted to hang out.  As I'm taking off my shoes I put down my bags and look over at the staircase.  The light at the top of the stairs was on.  I nearly shat myself.  This was a couple days after everyone had left for the cruise, and I was the only one home.  I have a very good habit of keeping doors/windows locked, as well as shutting off lights when they're not in use.  I was very alarmed to see the light on, to say the least.  I charged up the stairs, turned off the light, grabbed a few articles of clothing from my room and left the house.

Unless you've been in that situation where you sense something unknown may be willing to harm you, I can't really explain what it feels like.  Just completely helpless and panicked because you feel very threatened but you don't know how you cand defend yourself.


**My Cousin's Story**

My cousin's first encounter with April was a couple months after my first encounter.  She was home alone during the afternoon.  Munching on chips on the living room sofa watching tv, procastinating doing her homework.  When she got up from the couch to put the chips away in the kitchen, she heard a door close.  Upon peeking around the corner, she noticed it was her mom's door that had closed.  Thinking it was the wind or something, she went make it wide open again (she likes having doors open to be able to see into rooms).  When she sits back down and is about to change the channel, she sees almost exactly what I saw: a female dressed in white with long black hair going from the left side of the room to the right.

A few nights later she told me she told me she was having dreams about a woman with long black hair silently following her around the house.  She swears that when she woke up she could hear a girl's/woman's voice in her room.


Wheewww great times, remembering all these creepy memories!  I'll have to post more, but they are not as dramatic as the previous ones I've posted.

**EDIT:**



**BACKGROUND:**

I attended Point Park University from 2011-2012 as a freshman cinema major. One night, a few friends and I decided we were going to make a short comedy ghost film about two horny college kids trying to summon a spirit to have sex with them in a bathroom. This bathroom happened to be in a part of the school that people used, but not many. There were a few campus offices up there but it wasn't a part of the school everyone was always at. Anyways, we were filming our video when we started hearing noises and voices, such as banging on the air vents and piping in the bathroom. It was actually happening so much that we decided to throw the video out the window, and come back down to do a little ghost hunt.

To make a very long story short, we got activity in the bathroom. It's hard for me to remember the exact order in which things happened because we were down in the bathroom consecutive night after night investigating, from around 12:30-1 am each night. Some of the things we were experiencing were footsteps walking around us, cold spots, noises, people running outside the bathroom in the hall, banging on pipes/walls/air vents, and obviously captured EVPs. In one rare instance, two of our team members were exiting the bathroom when they saw a shadowy figure run up some stairs and through a locked door.

A few of our team members decided that they were going to do some research. They found out that the Pittsburgh Paranormal Society [had done an investigation](http://www.pointparkglobe.com/news/investigators-say-paranormal-activity-intense-1.1736262#.UUyVSDfIerg) in the office of Point Park's newspaper, which as it turns out was on the same floor and just around the corner from our bathroom. They came in contact with a spirit they believed to be Jacob, so naturally we tried contacting Jacob and to this day we believe we were very successful.

The more we investigated the more evidence we found. There was a small locker room attached to this bathroom, the room was probably 7'x7'. While investigating in this room, several of our team members would get dizzy or sick and would have to leave the investigation. We believed this spirit was not Jacob, but rather a different, negative spirit. Because we felt uneasy around this spirit we would restrict our time in the bathroom only to when we believed Jacob was around. If we felt uneasy we would dismiss Jacob or any other spirits we had talked to and leave immediately.

We also believe we had made contact with a spirit in the girls' bathroom on that floor. Only three of our members were only able to get accurate activity in the bathroom, so I'm not completely sure what evidence we ever found. We did believe that this spirit was a little girl.

One night while talking to Jacob, one of our team members asked the question, ""Did you die here?"" Immediately there was a very violent and loud bang on the wall next to us. You can hear this in our recorded EVPs, and it scared us very much. We stayed away from the bathroom for a few days, and when we finally did return we were all shook up. Listening back to the EVP recording of the night we went back, I can hear the pure terror in my voice as I was asking questions (I was naturally the lead investigator). Many of the team, including myself, felt uneasy that night so we left. We did not go back to the bathroom.

I was unable to go back to school this year due to financial reasons, but I did encourage my friends from the team to go back to the bathroom and do another investigation, just to see what happened. I believe they went a few times, and the first few times they went there wasn't much of a response at all. The very last time they went down to the bathroom, one of the members (probably the person who is most ""in-tune"" with the spiritual world other than myself) had a vision of horns and satanic/dark images while investigating. They have not been down to the bathroom since.

Thus, the crappy title, sorry. I just wanted people to know that it was the same post haha. Someone wanted to know more about my encounters, so I'd like to go in depth about the experience I had with one of those entities. The one that I could visibly see. 

I saw a shadow person, twice, within my lifetime. The first sighting was when I was in the car with my grandma, and I saw it on the side of the road, and the second was when it flew over/into me when I was exiting my kitchen at night. 

Now, let me try to explain to you what it looked like so you can have an idea of what I'm talking about here. It stood about a foot above me, I am 5'11"", so I guess it was about 7"" tall. It did not have defined edges like a shadow would. It was like if you had cried, and tried to look at a shadow? The edges of the shadow person were very hard to make out, but very apparent at the same time. Maybe the best example for the edges would be if you spilled ink onto a piece of rice paper. It made no sound, and it did not make wind or anything when it flew over me, it was completely silent. Even though the edges were hard to make out, I could see a very apparent humanoid figure, with a head, body, arms, and legs. It was the color black, but when compared to shadows, and the dark of night, it was a deeper black. Kind of like if you had cut a hole to a black hole in the shape of a man. I have never seen a darker black than that ever since.

So, the first time I saw it, I was with my grandma driving down the Pali Highway (Oahu,Hawaii, it's where I live). At first, it was in the shadows, so I thought it was some random bum on the side of the road, or just some street sign, or something, I don't know. However, the car turned just enough to shine the headlights upon the figure, and when it did, I saw it. It pierced through the headlights... It was a shadow, but fully illuminated. I can't really describe it. It was a SHADOW and blacker than night, but it was fully visible and had light pouring onto it by the car's lights. I really wish I could explain it, but I don't have the vocabulary for it. There was no penumbra, or double shadow or whatever, it was just one single shadow figure. It disturbed the hell out of me, I felt like it was unnatural, and that it did not belong, and that feeling filled me with horror, and curiosity. As our car passed, I saw the shadow figure into the distance, and go out of my vision. That was my first experience.

My second encounter was in my kitchen. This was about 4 years after that incident. I was going for a midnight snack, and after getting some food, I proceeded to exit the kitchen. Now, my kitchen is pretty small,and has a single door frame as an exit to the hall which has my room. Down the hall to the right, there are stairs that go down to the front door. I walked to the door frame, and all of a sudden, out of fucking NOWHERE, this big dark figure of a man comes floating up the stairs VERY quickly, and over me. Or into me. All I know is that it encompassed my vision, and then was gone. Like an owl swooping down to it's prey, big black shadows of wings. That's the best I can describe it. I didn't feel like it wanted to hurt me though, I don't think it even cared what I did, it was just walking around and I happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. 

And that's it. My encounter with shadow people, or shades, or whatever. Not too scary, but I think it's pretty interesting. I'm not afraid of them, but I'm defiantly respectful of them. Hopefully you got a scare out of my experiences.

I could talk about some other times I had some paranormal encounters, such as the faces in the windows, the little white figure in my garage, or I can tell my grandpa's encounters.

Early on, beginning shortly after moving to this apartment, I would often feel like I was watched in this apartment, and it was overall creepy, but I couldn't put my finger on the feelings. Initially, I checked the blinds, etc, to make sure no peeping toms were looking into the apartment and once I confirmed that all was clear, I  just ignored the feelings as best as I could.

I lived there with my husband (my boyfriend back then) and two cats (whom we still have). The cats would sometimes stare at the ceiling/upper walls in certain spots, but I easily dismissed that as them seeing some bug that I couldn't see, or hearing neighbors, or...hey, they're cats, cats stare at weird things! (but in hindsight--we have lived in two additional apartments since then, including our current one--which has active neighbors--and our cats did/do not stare at random spots in these apartments).

Anyway, on the night in question, I went to bed at around 2am, which was normal for me back then (my boyfriend always went to bed at around 11pm since he had to get up early for work). My cats usually went to bed with me, but they did not on this night, and after laying awake for a while, I decided to call to to them or try to see what they were up to (I can easily see the short hallway/dining area from that bedroom, and if the cats were running around like fools, I would have seen them as they raced through that space--these cats are a light/buff orange tabby and mostly-white calico, so they are easy to see in dim light).

So, I sat up in bed and looked out into the hallway. When I did, I realized I was looking at this roughly 7 foot tall, deep, deep dark black mass with a rough head/shoulder/torso shape--the rest kind of trailed off. It was night, and it was dark, but there was enough dim light in the apartment for me to easily see this thing. It was blacker than black--as if a black hole had somehow taken on a form and appeared in my apartment. Baffled, I leaned forward in bed and peered at it, trying to figure out what the fuck it was. I really didn't believe my eyes at first--I'm by nature a logical person, so this just floored me.

After I gawked at it for a few seconds, it seemed to turn (even though it had no features, I just *knew* it was turning to look at me) and when it did, I saw it had red eyes. At that very second, I was overcome by intense fear and dread--I can tell you that I have been in some very scary situations in my life, but the fear I felt at that moment was more raw than any other I have felt--and right after it turned to look straight at me, it flew through the bedroom doorway at me, towards my face.

I did the only thing I could think of and ducked underneath the covers. ""Terrified"" only scratches the surface of how I felt then.

After a few moments, I found it hard to breathe under there. I decided to elbow my sleeping boyfriend hard enough to wake him up, and by wake him up I mean make him sit up/turn over/get annoyed and ask me what I was doing. When he woke up and turned over and I didn't feel him react in a way that implied the ""thing"" was still in the bedroom, I felt like it was safe to pull the covers off my head. Not wanting to seem like a crazy person, I told him I had a nightmare and tried to sleep. It did not come easily to me that night.

I did eventually tell my boyfriend what I had seen that night, after mulling over the experience in my head. I looked at it from every possible angle--was I tired and hallucinating? Could I have mistaken a shadow for this? Had I been dreaming? Each suggestion was quickly explained away, and I was at a loss for words.

Up until this point, I thought that ghosts were misty women in white dresses that haunted old mansions and castles. I certainly hadn't heard of or expected to see one in the form of a nightmarish shadow, in a 70s-era Chicago apartment building.

I--and later, my boyfriend--saw the deep black shadow again, but not as a 7-foot thing with red eyes. It was smaller and not threatening (relatively, anyway) when we saw it again (once by me, once by him, on separate occasions--I can't tell you how relieved I was when I found out that my hardcore skeptic boyfriend saw the shadow).",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_154ctc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/154ctc/mefamencounters_with_black_shadows_including_a/,

After spending basically every waking hour sitting around in the hospital for 4 days... We went to my families summer house about an hour out &amp; in the middle of nowhere to cool down &amp; get some sleep. I knew at this point that they would be pulling my sisters life support at some point but wasn't aware of when exactly. Despite being at the hospital, the doctors would communicate with my dad who wasn't exactly awesome at relaying or communicating things to us. 

We grabbed a 12 pack of yuengling, out of habit, &amp; continued up to the summer house- Me, my younger sister &amp; my boyfriend. When we got there, we went and sat in the living room area &amp; all mindlessly drank a beer while attempting conversation. I was sitting on a couch with my boyfriend while my sister was on a rocking chair facing toward us. 

My father called and told me that they were going to be taking my sister off life support right then. 

After announcing the information I had received &amp; a little bit of convo...I was staring out the window, pretty overwhelmed &amp; just kind of spacing out a little. All of a sudden a white face slowly materialized &amp; then was gone in a flash. It was probably only a few seconds but felt longer, for sure. The second after, I looked at my sister and knew immediately that she had seen exactly what I had just seen. At the same time we both said, completely in sync, ""you saw it too"". After that moment we both kind of started to freak out and decided that we couldn't be there anymore and left almost immediately. 

I would have just brushed it off and blamed it on my being stressed out and exhausted but my sister also seeing exactly what I did confirmed that I wasn't just being crazy. Also, there's absolutely no way it could have been an actual person... besides the fact it is pretty much out in the middle of nowhere, it was just a face &amp;  if it were a person- they would of had to of been like 10 feet tall for their face to be where it appeared.

The family had planned a trip down to visit him before he was deployed to Africa. I had arrived a couple days before the rest of the family and was treated to a personal tour of the small 3 bedroom house. I'd gotten a weird feeling as soon as I stepped foot into the house, and I jokingly asked my brother ""Is there any weird noises or scary things in this place I should be aware of?"". He chuckled and said ""well it's haunted"". We had a quick laugh and before I knew it, he explained many things that went on inside the place. I'm a very skeptical person, and i discredited almost all of them instantly. In the next couple days before the fam arrived, I had spent alot of time alone in the house partnered with his new pup ""Yenko"" 
   
My brother would leave at 5 AM, come home around 6 PM, and go to sleep around 8, so without a car, I spent most of my time on the couch in front of the tv. One of the days when I was home alone watching tv, I hear some clunking in the kitchen. I got up, walked into the kitchen, grabbed a drink and returned to my butt grove on the couch. The noise continued, so i got back up and went to refill my drink. I walked back into the kitchen to find every cupboard and drawer opened, exactly like the scene in the sixth sense. I slowly shut everything, and went to sit back on the couch. The noises continue over the coarse of the next half hour or so, until I finally yelled ""stop!"" all noises quit for the rest of the day.

The next day, I again made sure the couch had no chance of floating away. The couch sits along a wall facing the tv, and at the end of the couch is a hallway that goes back to the bedrooms. I hadn't really noticed until I heard the growl. but Yenko had been staring down the hallway for about a minute.  ""Yenko"" I yelled as the dog directed his attention at me for a split second and than instantly back down the hall way. ""Yenko! Get Over he...."". The dog started barking like mad, and cowering backwards towards the middle of the living room. I believe it was roughly 4 PM at the time, and outside I sat until my brother got home at 6.

The family was arriving tomorrow, and me and my brother had said our goodnights. I stayed up late and went to bed at about 1 in the morning. I woke up a little after 3 AM to the sound of.. slower early 1900's swing music? It was faint, but loud enough for me to wonder WTF my brother was doing... I left the room, walked 10' down the hall to his room. At the door I noticed the music did get louder, but seemed to get louder the closer I got to the living room. His door opened and I screamed the most embarassing scream to date. He was a bit upset at me for waking him up, and asked what in the world I was doing playing music while he was trying to sleep. I let him know what was going on, and we began searching the house. Thinking it was coming for the neighbors, I stepped outside only to hear traffic. We pinpointed the source of the music to just outside the dining room, where nothing was. We both just shrugged and went back to bed.

My family had finally arrived, and later that night my mother had made her famed lemon rice soup that me and my brother loved so much growing up. We all ate at the dinner table for the first time as a family in years. There was a light over the table with a switch on the wall that was one of those circular push in for on, and you can rotate the circle to adjust brightness. during dinner, the light switched itself off. My brother gets up and clicks it back on. ""has that ever happened before?"" asked my mom. ""No"" my brother laughed as he sat back down...   

There were many other story's from the house. My sister in law heard some voices, every picture we have of my brother in that house has an orb in it, usually next to his head, my brother swears he saw a shadow walk down the hall...  lots of stuff... anyways, figured I'd share.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_14074x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/14074x/another_post_reminded_me_of_my_time_in/,

I live on my own, in a garage-turned-studio with just my cat to keep me company. But Laura and I are together most of the time, either at her place or mine. She lives in a garage as well, but it’s not set up as a separate living space, nor does it have a door leading to the main house, meaning that whenever we have to pee, shower, eat, or get water, we have to walk outside the garage, up the main walk, and into the house.

 We’re both scary movie addicts, but lately it had been really tough to find a quality one. Since Netflix’s selection really sucks, that left us out of instantly available options to browse, so we decided to Google movies to download. We were both in a silly creepy mood when we started browsing, but it quickly turned more to the dark side just by the blurbs on some of the movies we found. She slowly became more and more sober, eventually simply sitting there quietly, propped up on my headboard, and staring down at her hands. The conversation died pretty quickly with that change in her, so I just continued to click away at my laptop as I had been doing, unconcerned. Finally she looked up and stared at the opposite wall, breaking the silence. 

“Do you... Do you ever, like, hear things? Voices?”

“Like, in your head? All the time.” I said, giving her a faux shifty-eyed look, but she didn’t smile. 

“No, I mean for real. It happens when I'm alone, and mostly when I’m in the shower. I'll feel something first, a small chill going past my head. Sometimes it'll seem like a whisper...” She trailed off and looked at me, “I dunno. It kinda feels like someone rubs their fingers together right near my ear. And it freaks me out! I’ll spin around, but of course nothings there.”

“What do they whisper?’ I asked.

“My name. And then, when they have my attention, I can hear something else, more talking, but never make it out. Sort of like a radio station going in and out of frequency. ”

“Well that’s creepy as shit.” I said. “But no, I can honestly say I’ve never heard anything like that.”

At this point I could tell she wasn’t just saying this to creep me out, that she honestly believed she heard things. She’s normally a very cheerful person, but while telling me this, her eyes had somehow gotten darker and her face pale. Now, while I’d like to believe in ghosties and ghoulies, I always pull a Scully when I hear of a supernatural experience. And this time I did just that – I dismissed what she was telling me and chalked it up to her own poor hearing and paranoia. She was quiet the rest of the night, and I didn’t think about it again. Until the other night.

Laura picked me up from work in the evening and we went straight to her house. She paints at a bar here in town, and I’ve joined her before, just to sketch. That night had been her scheduled night there, so we stayed till around midnight, both being too tired to drink. By the time we left we were just hungry and sleepy, and it seemed pancakes were on the menu at her place. When we got there, we went straight into the dark house, bypassing her garage, and bee-lined for the kitchen. Most of her roommates were gone, judging by the lack of cars in the street, so we didn’t bother keeping our voices down. We got the pancake ingredients out and started whipping them together. Laura was struggling with the mixing part when she had the brilliant idea to grab some chocolate chips we kept stashed in the garage and make the pancakes all chocolatey goodness. She wasted no time shoving the mixing bowl into my arms and scampering off to the front door. So I stood there, happily beating away at the mixture, alone in an island of light in a dark and silent house. 

She had left the kitchen a few moments before I heard the whisper. I don’t know how long it was going on before I noticed it, but now that I had, I could hear it clearly. My name. At first I thought it was Laura, trying to get my attention, to alert me to someone hooking up on the couch or something. I clutched the mixing bowl tightly, stirring mechanically as I turned my head slowly to my right, staring across the empty kitchen into the gaping darkness of the living room.
 
‘Laura?’ My voice was wavering.
 
 Now that it - they, it was definitely a they - had my attention, the whispering escalated, excited. They were saying more, but I couldn’t understand any of it. It had a cruel, distorted, and gleeful tone. Like they knew I couldn’t understand them; knew exactly what they were doing, how terrified it made me-, and they enjoyed it. There was no way in hell I thought I could move, until my feet slowly started carrying me across the kitchen. The only panicked thought in my head that wasn’t screaming or numb in fear was still telling me Laura might be standing there, just beyond the light, right where I couldn’t see her. Stopping just short of the living room entry way, I tried calling out her name again. But I couldn’t. I felt like if I opened my mouth too wide, my insides would come tumbling out. So I just stood there, staring into the dark, wide eyed and gripping the mixing spoon with white knuckles. I was trying to listen over the sound of my heart beating its way out of my chest, but there was nothing more.

I was still standing like that a minute later when Laura opened the front door and came in, carrying the chocolate chips. We decided to not tell anyone about what we heard. And I still didn't want to believe, but last night Laura woke up at 2am to one of the girl housemates squeezing into bed with her. She asked in a nervous little whisper if Laura has ever heard voices in the house when no one else is home. I’m petrified of that place now. We’ve never heard anything in her garage, so if it is some entity, it must be staying inside. The weird thing is- she's lived there 3 years and we've never experienced anything like this before. Someone on nosleep said it could be a demon, but they're not all that helpful...

Since everyone was interested in my other story, here we go. I'll apologize right now for it being so long, I just figured you would like the full details. Just as a catch up for the individuals in this story - Holly is my girlfriend. Megan, Josh, Kyle, and Emma are all our mutual friends. Josh is very interested in the paranormal and was the one who took us to the gravesite in the first story I told you guys. 

Around the second or third night Josh and I hung out after work, he began expressing his interest in the paranormal with me. We both worked the late shift at Taco Bell over the summer, so we'd get out around 2:30 in the morning. We'd drive to my house since it was right down the road and just hang out in the backyard and smoke cigarettes or go in my bedroom, which was in the basement, and watch music videos on youtube. You know, typical teenager stuff. This night, we were in the basement, in my room. The basement in my dad's house was unfinished, it had nothing but insulation on the walls everywhere, except my room. My room was finished off, a winter project my dad and I took up. My dad basically used the basement for storage of his tools. I had always heard things being down in the basement, but nothing weird. Sometimes I'd hear a noise from the basement itself, but never anything in my room or even near my door. It always sounded distant, then again, basement sounds were rare. The real noises that I always heard were upstairs near the front of the house. The front of the house had a wooden floor, and I'd always hear a strange ""popping"" or ""thudding"" or ""stepping"" noise throughout the night. 

I guess the concept of this intrigued Josh when I told him. He said he's heard that as well only being in my room for, what, three days at most? He dove into his concepts of the paranormal. Ghosts and demons, hauntings and witches and Indian Burial Grounds, all of it was something that really piqued his interests. He began asking me all about the footsteps and any other things that I may have experienced. I told him that was it, aside from the - what I thought was typical - things that go ""bump"" in the night.

Josh figured it would be best that he stay the night, he wanted to sleep on my couch just so he could experience everything that could be happening. He turned his phone recorder on periodically throughout the night while I was sleeping and recorded when he heard the footsteps. I don't remember if there was a pattern or anything, but he did play the recordings for me and you could hear the footsteps, plan as ever. Just like someone walking upstairs. It was kind of crazy. I'm a skeptic and don't believe many paranormal stories and I always dismissed those noises and just ""wood settling in"" or whatever I thought it was. 

I told my girlfriend at the time, Holly, about what we experienced the next day. She was really put off by the story, she said she too had heard things but never wanted to say anything since I was, like I said, a skeptic and ""wouldn't believe her anyway."" Later that same day, Holly, our friend Megan, and myself were sitting in the garage talking and the topic of ghosts came up. Megan said, without any of us saying anything to her previously, if either of us had ever heard the footsteps. Holly took that question way worse than I did, she became genuinely scared. 

Flash forward a couple of months, my dad was going out of town for a week and I had the house to myself. What does a 17 year old with a girlfriend and a house to himself do? Offer her to come stay with him for the week of course. Uninterrupted sex and we could drink and smoke and have nothing to worry about. Fantastic. The first night we were down in the basement after we ate dinner. I was on the couch and she was, well, on her knees in front of me. She was giving me a blowjob and all of the sudden she stopped, glancing out of the corner of her eye out the door. Shit, is my dad home without me realizing?! I look out the door and see nothing. The lights are on, but there's nothing. She said she saw something, and so I frustratedly pulled my sweatpants up and walked out of my room to nothing. She peaked her head out of my room and asked if I saw anything and if she could come with me if I'm going to check out the rest of the house. I asked her what she saw and she says there was a shadow of someone walking, as if they walked down into the basement and realized my door was open and started walking to my room. I checked out the rest of the house and there was nothing. She said she was sorry and I hugged her and said it was fine. We went to sleep that night and I didn't hear anything else about it for the next couple of days.

It was a Friday and we invited another mutual friend-couple over to hang out, my friend Kyle and his girlfriend Emma. Kyle and I made a deal with the girls, they make us breakfast and we'll make them dinner. So they did. Unfortunately, our dinner plans required Kyle and me to go out to the grocery store to pick up some supplies. On my way to the grocery store my phone rings and it's Holly. She's crying and said that something happened and we need to come back home immediately. She said that a glass of Gatorade was thrown down in the kitchen while she and Emma were in the living room and when they went to see what had happened, the TV in my dad's room - which was located hear the living room - turned on to static and was really loud and his bathroom sink was turned on. Kyle and I were running back to my car when the phone rang again and it was Holly. She was panicking and screaming that Emma had a seizure. I told her to not touch her and we would be home in five minutes. 

When we got in the door, I could hear the television's static. It was loud and obnoxious, but I was more concerned about Holly and Emma. I ran into the living room and saw Holly cuddled up next to Emma under a blanket on the floor. I asked Emma if she was okay and she said she was. Holly was crying and telling me to go look at the kitchen and my dad's bedroom. It was just as she described. A broken glass on the floor in the kitchen, TV on static and the sink on full blast in my dad's room. I turned off the television and the sink. Everything went back to normal. Kyle and I went ahead with dinner and the rest of the evening went on fine. 

I ended up telling my friend Josh about what happened, he said that he believes that I might be some good energy that keeps haunting spirits at bay. Me being gone may have upset them in some way. He had no real answers, just that ""holy shit dude"" reaction I'd had.

Megan's mom ended up dating my dad and they have been together for a couple of years now, I live far away from home and whenever I come back to visit and run into Megan she always brings up those footsteps. It's kind of funny to me now, and I still can't believe it. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_x6h63,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/x6h63/me_footsteps_and_shadows_in_the_basement/,

We moved here before I turned 16, so at 24 I am more than comfortable with the strange things that happen.

My older brother came home one day with a set of speakers he had bought off an old friend. He was going to use them but If I remember correctly, he went with my dad not long after to go shopping for a new set.

I was delighted at the idea of setting these speakers up and being able to connect my iPod so I could listen to music in my room.

At night I unplug all of the electricals (getting ahead of myself here - there are like 3 plugs) just out of habit. So my speakers are unplugged and this was pre-iPhone and my Nokia battery usually lasted for more than 2 days, leaving my lamp to be the only electrical appliance being connected to power.

At night around 11pm I could hear a woman singing, ever so softly and gently. She would sing a song and she would be joined by a man who spoke incoherent words. I didn't know where the noises were coming from at first but in the end I could hear it come from the speakers.

11pm and just after 3am is when the singing occurred and they were always such warm and lovely voices.

Do they exist or no? How sure are you? What do you think they are? And how do they make you feel?

I'll start

It pains me to say, though i grow more used to it as time passes, that I believe in them. I don't believe they are spirits, because I don't think there is such a thing as a ""soul"". I believe there is humanity, and good, but i don't think there's this ""thing"" that lives on after us. I also don't believe in God... at all.

I believe in them for reasons i've already detailed in my stories. Now, *what* do I believe in? I believe these things are around, but I cannot assume i know what they are.

If I had to guess, I'd say they are scars... residues, left overs. I think that there's a lot that science hasn't touched, such as these things and other ""feelings."" I don't want to sound like a quack, but emotions are powerful things, and maybe it's these things that leave the residues, like a loop or an idea that remains behind. I believe that when we die, it goes dark.. forever. I don't think these things are aware.

I don't believe in seances, I dont' believe in seers, and if you tell me you see them all the time, and that you're familiar with them, I believe you even less than I did originally... which is hardly at all. I think these things are extremely rare, but maybe it is true that some people, either by luck or other things, are more prone to see experience them more often.

Basically, I believe in what i've seen and nothing else. The rest are assumptions.

How do I feel about them?

Terrified out of my fucking wits. I've had many people tell me they cannot harm me... well, I disagree! The first one, the one i saw dead on, left me traumatized... and i don't use the word lightly. She did nothing but stand there, and her back was too me, yet that image disturbs me to no end, and my mind keeps picking at it like a sore... and like a sore it only grows when that happens. Any time my mind wishes to recoil at the fact that i believe, i can't help but remember her and the clear image i have in my head. It haunts me.

And the second encounter was malicious, and aimed at me. Something moved a big door at me, a huge heavy thing that i had a hard time moving at age 18. it was thrown at me. So yeah, excuse me while I say, these fucking things scare me, and with good reason. God forbid I ever look one in the face, or in the eye, or see the lady again for that matter. And don't get me started with gore or disembodied parts. I'll seriously, no joke, lose my shit. Just keep screaming and screaming and screaming. When i'm paranoid, i fear seeing a face looking back at me. That thought makes my eyes water. what if it moves? or smiles? or comes at me? I'm fucking dead.

So yeah, that's what I think of them...

I guess just as a notation I would say that even though this probably should scare the crap out of me, out of everything that has happened these past two weeks it really doesn't come as a shock. Anyway, to the occurance I guess. 

So it was about time for me to wake up and make my rounds about the house to get ready for work. You can check the weather reports but it was completely clear skies when this happened. I was just about to get out of bed and all of the sudden the sound of a lightning strike right outside my window racked my ears and flooded my room with light. It was freaky that it was so close but at first I thought maybe it was starting to storm and had been while I was sleeping. But after the hour or so that it takes me to get up and get ready, I finally headed out to my car. 

On the way I looked over as my car is parked on the same side as my room is on the house and on the grass between my car and the house is this patch of singed grass that is from what I could tell about 2ft in diameter. Still not the weird part. Thats when I noticed that there wasn't a cloud in the sky for miles and no resemblance of a drop of rain anywhere. And then I saw the weird part. 

Spaced about a foot apart and in a patern that would look as if someone walking, there were these strips of scorched grass that were very slim and were about half a foot lengthwise and only had about and inch or two width. There was one set of these 'tracks' that went straight from the patch to the foot of my window (one story house) and another set that went straight to the drivers side of my car door. 

Still weird but once again after the other events this is just another day almost. I should mention that nobody else was home as my parents were and are still in Germany for two weeks and my little brother was staying at a friends house as he is out of school for the summer. It was just a weird occurance and wanted to post because you guys have given me more help over the past two weeks than any other sub. Maybe this will be one you can explain away for me. 

Thank you in advance.

Hi guys, this is my first post to NoSleep, so go easy on me.

This happened at Camp Cho Yeh – a Christian summer camp in Livingston Texas.  I am not now, nor was I ever a practicing Christian.

I was 8 years old, struggling with my faith  and scared shitless of demons.  I had seen a news story just before summer camp about exorcisms and demonic possession, so it was fresh in my mind.  I asked my camp counsellor about it and he told me that possessions only happen to people who haven’t accepted Jesus into their hearts.  He assumed I had already accepted Jesus, but I hadn’t.  In fact I was just starting to lean away from him and the Church.

I don’t think he was trying to scare me into believing, or using fear to teach me about Jesus.  I think he genuinely believed he was saying the right thing, but it only convinced me that my body was primed and ready for possession.  I didn’t mention demons to any of the other boys, or to anyone else at camp.  I would lay awake at night, staring up at the high ceiling of the cabin.  My imagination would form sinister faces out of the knots and grain of the wood.  There was a good portion of those 2 weeks where I didn’t sleep.  

We played capture the flag one night.  Had my counsellor not rattled my world, I would have been excited.  The playing field was a big hill surrounded on all sides by forest.  It was a co-ed camp and the counsellors weren’t allowed to play.  We were even given glow sticks (it was 1991 and glow sticks weren’t as common as they are today).  We were divided into teams and paired up with someone older or younger.  My partner was an older girl that nobody liked.  She was very blunt.  She wanted to hold both glow sticks because she was older and faster than me.  She bolted away from the crowd to sneak up on the flag commando style.  I told her slow down.  She told me to ‘fast up’ and then lost me in the woods, probably on purpose.

Livingston is Northeast of Houston, and surrounded by pine forests – Cho Yeh is a Coushatta phrase that means ‘a place of tall pines.’  If you’ve ever been in a dense pine forest at night, you know how creepy they can be.  The trunks are like smooth, dark columns because the lowest branches are usually out of reach. The towering foliage blocks out any moonlight.  The ground is soft with dead pine needles, so it’s relatively quiet, even when a hundred or so kids are running through the woods trying not to be heard.

So I was alone, scared of being possessed, and I didn’t even have a glow stick for light.  I ran through the forest, but somehow kept getting further away from the green lights and sounds of the other kids until I could no longer see or hear them.  I came to a wide clearing where the power lines cut through the trees.  To my left and right was a bare valley of grass with humming wires overhead, but now I could see a bit better from the light of the moon.  I don’t recall if it was a full moon, but it was bright enough.  I crouched down in the grass, in the shadows at the edge of the woods, watching and listening intently.  I no longer cared about winning the game, I just wanted to get back with the other kids and feel safe.

Something happened at this point that I can’t explain.  It still makes my hair stand up and makes my eyes water 20 years later.  I heard pounding footsteps coming toward me from the shadows to my left, slower and more lumbering than a horse, but just as loud and heavy. Too loud and heavy to be human, and exhaling a bullish snort as its feet hit the grass.  I buried my head into my knees as it passed behind me, too scared to look at it directly.  

But I looked just after it had passed.  The moon was high, so the shadows were distorted to look short and squat, not long and lean like when light comes from the horizon.  What I saw was the shadow of a broad human torso, with an elongated and bent head.  It was already about 30 yards away from me and, quicker than it came, it disappeared into the woods where the game was being played.  Behind me, in the grass of the clearing, was one large foot-like impression, as though it had run around me and stepped out into the moonlight only for a second.

I tore off through the clearing, not sure if I was going the right way but following the power lines and staying as far from the shadows as I could.  Luckily I made it back to camp and went straight to the nurse’s station.  Some other kids were there with cuts from the game, and I just pretended that I had gotten lost and needed  water.  I didn’t tell anyone about what I saw.  If anyone else saw it, they never said anything about it to me.

I didn’t do so well the rest of camp, and I think this is where me and Jesus first parted ways.  The rifle range and canoeing were still fun, but I was always afraid of what might come bounding out of those woods.

Yesterday I read a story here about a guy who heard something through a ghost app. I never heard about those apps before, and I thought it would be funny. So I downloaded one, and once I was alone in my room I turned it on. It immediatly said there were 2 ghosts in my room, but I obviously thought it was fake. The app said weird things like ""alive"", ""beneath"", ""pleasant"", stuff like that. I grew tired of it, turned the app off and went to sleep. That's when it started happening. I heard my computer turn on, so I opened my eyes again. That's when I also saw the chair moving, and I heard footsteps. I started freaking out, but I told myself I was half asleep and was imagining things. I forced myself to close my eyes and fall asleep. Somehow it worked. When I woke up again, the computer was off again, and the chair was in the exact same position it was in before I went to bed. But that's not the strange thing. I just came back from vacation, and I was still busy unpacking my suitcase. But when I woke up, my suitcase was gone. It was nowhere in my room, even though I had put it next to the door. When I asked my mom about it, she told me she hadn't touched it. My suitcase isn't the only thing that's missing, also little things like my ring, but it's the suitcase that bothers me. It couldn't just dissapear into thin air, but it's nowhere in the house, I searched everywhere. Now, I've had some ghost trouble before, but never in my own house. As far as I know, it was never haunted. And I'm sure there are suddenly 2 ghosts, as yesterday I saw the chair moving at the same time I heard footsteps in the hallway. Did the ghost app somehow summon them? How do I get rid of them?

EDIT: well, my suitcase is back at the exact same spot I left it yesterday. I'm sure it was gone though, I searched my whole room and house looking for it. Even though my suitcase is back, not everything that was still inside it is in it. About 5 things are missing now, and I'm 100% sure it was still in the suitcase.",,False,,t5_2sntx,True,,,True,t3_tehvp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tehvp/me_dissappearing_suitcase/,

It looked to have been built in the 1950's or so. I was told that the previous owners had been an old couple. The husband had died in the hospital of emphysema. 
Now I had never been the kind of kid to be afraid of the dark. I was a very pragmatic little girl; I stopped going to church with my parents at 7 years old because I just didn't buy what they were selling, and I don't remember at any point believing in Santa Clause, the Easter Bunny, etc. That is not to say I was militantly against belief in these things. Let's just call me a booster-seat skeptic.  

For our first few months in the new house my little sister and I shared the tiny second bedroom with bunk beds. Aside from the kitchen and my parents bedroom on the first floor, we also had a nicely decorated sitting room. ""For company."" The basement was mostly unfinished, with cold tile floors and concrete walls, except for a long, narrow, wood paneled 'man cave' that ran alongside the left (viewed from the street) side of the house, under the sitting room and kitchen. At the back of this cave there was a bar, and it was clear that there had been a dartboard on the opposite wall. 

As I was entering my angsty tweens, my parents decided to move me to the finished room in the basement. Aside from having no light due to it having one tiny window, I was happy to have my own, much larger, room. In the other side of the basement we put a couch, an old TV and the family computer as the 'rec room'. It should have been a cozy, comfortable place, and most of the time, it was.

It was only in the evenings when I started to experience a feeling of intense unease. I like to read before sleeping, so I would hunker down, as I always had, and read long into the night. Not long after I began this practice, I started to experience an overwhelming feeling of being watched. My bed sat against the short side of the wall directly opposite the side with the bar, and I could not stop myself from compulsively peering around the book, sure I would catch something staring at me from behind the bar. I had never experienced this type of paranoia before, and part of me thought I was going a little crazy. Years later, knowing what I know now, I looked for high voltage wires around the area or anything that would create the 'fear cage' effect around that part of the room, but there was nothing.

It became a pretty routine feeling, though I was in no way getting used to it, until one night I reached up and yanked the cord for the overhead light that swung above my head, turned over and pulled the covers over me leaving only enough room for me to see my digital clock (I had started doing this only after moving in to this room) and settled down to get some sleep. 

Immediately upon closing my eyes, I felt a hand tighten around my right shoulder and lift me up and back slightly. My body, reacting without thinking, bolted straight up and I groped wildly for the cord to the light, which of course began to swing erratically, remaining out of my reach. After a few moments of flailing that in retrospect were almost comic, I was able to turn the light on.

Nothing there.

Not a thing.
But there was no doubt in my mind that something had grabbed my shoulder. I had not been asleep, not even a little bit, I was not having a muscle spasm, and I am comfortably familiar with the 'sleep paralysis' phenomenon, and it has never frightened me. After a few minutes of deliberating, I decided that whatever had touched me was not a serious threat, and returned to my sleeping position. I was not molested again that night.

Fast forward a few years. The watchfulness and paranoia remain, but I'm getting more used to it. I had decided that if there **is** something watching me, it is most likely the spirit of the deceased man that made this room his man cave. It doesn't feel malevolent to me, just intrusive. But this is only speculation - I have neither seen nor heard anything,  nor has my family remarked on anything weird. 
And then one night, the scenario completely identical, I am making ready to sleep when one of my legs is moved - slid, from alignment down one side of the bed to a position all the way across the bed, essentially rendering me spread eagle. All the while I'm thinking ""my muscles aren't contracting, wtfwtfwtf.."".
 
Cue another frantic grab for the light. Again, nothing. But this time, rather than being frightened and puzzled, I am **righteously pissed**.  ""Excuse me, mister!"", I bark at the empty room, ""I understand that this was your place for a long time while you were alive, but you sir are DEAD. I have to live here now and I am just trying to get some SLEEP. Now you will kindly back the fuck off and leave me alone or I am shortly going to get VERY FUCKING PERTURBED!"". Feeling a little bit like an idiot, but somehow a lot comforted, I turn over and indignantly go to sleep. From then on, up until I moved out to go to college, I was unmolested. 

While I was in college, my parents remodeled the house. They expanded the kitchen and the basement and yep, removed the bar and a chunk of my old room. 
One night, during a rare visit back to my home town, I was in the newly renovated kitchen playing Dutch Blitz with my mother and sister. I had my back to the small kitchenette and the living room beyond, where around a small divider, my current boyfriend sat discussing existential issues with my Dadoo. It was a warm, happy time. 

At one point in the night, during a brief lull in the conversation, I heard my dad walk into the kitchen and stand behind my chair, watching us play Dutch Blitz. I began to talk to him without looking around. I noticed shortly that my mom and sister were looking at me like I was wearing a Napoleon hat and speaking in Pig Latin. It was then that I realized that I could still hear my dad and boyfriend speaking quietly in the living room. Whoever I was speaking to,  it was not my dad. 

I am still skeptical about what I *believe* to be honestly going on here, but my gut feeling was that there IS an entity in my house, and though a little solicitous, is ultimately benign and simply bored. I have never used a Ouija to try to contact it, as I'm not sure I believe in the usefulness of such a device, but I am open to any suggestions as to how I may address this entity in the future.

Anyway, here are my stories:

I noticed the first true paranormal event when I was told to sleep in my own room (as one of my sisters moved out). I was scared as shit, but later on decided to tough it out anyway. So I turned off the lights, went to sleep and was promptly woken up by the lamp in the ceiling blinking in a weird manner. I ran out into my parents bedroom and told them and was told I could sleep there for the night. As I was nestling in, feeling scared still, the light above my parents bed started to behave the same way. My dad unscrewed the lightbulb and told me to go back to sleep, which I did hours later. The two lights were on separate circuits, and no other lights/appliances on the same circuit behaved the same way either. 

Second event:

My old grandma had a small tower clock which my mom inherited when she died. Said clock was a pretty interesting piece of mechanic engineering which had a distinct sounding gong played (kind of like a full size tower clock would have). I remember being utterly fascinated with it's old style roman lettering and the fact that you had to wind it up for it to work. 

That all changed when they mothballed the clock as some of the mechanisms in the clock had broken down and wasn't working anymore, I remember seeing my dad remove the feather springs and cursing about it. But, a few times when I was at home during evenings, I would hear the goddamned clock still randomly chiming in the broom closet where it was stashed. I told my dad about it and he told me not to be silly as there was no way that could chime with it's springs removed. They later threw away the clock although it was highly treasured by my mother, I always found that odd, but I've never gotten any other reason other than ""it was broken"".

Last story:

Later on in life, I was all alone at home, cutting some bread, when I needed to pee suddenly. So put down the knife on the cutting board and head for the toilet. When I come back, the knife had been thrust into the cutting board and was still trembling from the force it took. I freaked and ran out of the apartment and slammed the door behind me. I returned later in the day (this was before cell phones were common) and hoped my parents had returned which they thankfully had. I got a scolding for having ruined the cutting board despite my assurances it wasn't me. (and they told me I hadn't locked the door, which I hadn't when I ran out there in fear) The knife had been thrust through the cutting board and the tip was protruding slightly into the table too.

There are other experiences by my family, but those can be all debunked easily (sleep paralysis, lucid dreams etc) so I won't go into those. But, years after, we talked to someone who lived in the apartment next door and they told us that they'd also experienced weird things while they lived there. I guess something really bad happened there that caused this whole thing.

Edit: Debunking is welcome, but I suppose this all happened so long ago that two things apply: 1) I was a kid, I could have gotten things confused 2) Someone could have pulled a VERY elaborate prank on me, although with my paranoia, I don't see how.

As the older sister, it was her job to look after her younger sister. Her mother concentrated on domestic duties; such as cooking, cleaning, mending, and generally looking after everyone. Her father was a typical hard-nosed working man.  Even at his worst he could put in a day’s worth of work that would rival most. He was a lot like my step-father  in that even after catching the worst flu he would still be pushing himself to get his job done.
 
She was 13 and her sister was 10 when they made their summer pilgrimage to Portugal. They still had family in the Azores Islands. Her grandmother had a gorgeous house that stood proudly against the edge of a cliff; overlooking the ocean.  One night balmy night the family sat at a picnic table next to the vineyard in the backyard. My friend’s father had been feeling really run down the whole trip and it seemed that it was finally catching up to him. He told his family that he would head to bed for the night and try to sleep off the slump into which he felt himself slipping deeper. This was a very abnormal action for him but my friend’s mother wasn’t too concerned.
 
Worst case scenario if her father needed anything he could just lean out of the upstairs window that he was laying next to and yell down for help. The night carried on and the stars shone overhead. My friend’s mother decided to head inside to sit with her mother-in-law in the living room. Suddenly, my friend and her younger sister saw something in the sky. They stared in awe for a minute until the vision stopped. She looked at her younger sister to see if they truly saw what they just saw. My friend saw beams of colored light surging into their father’s bedroom window. It was truly brilliant as they disappeared as quickly as they had arrived. She looked to her little sibling to see that she was shaking and crying. My friend asked if she had seen the rays of light and her sister shook her head no. Instead, she said she saw her father in his coffin.
 
Her father died that night.
 
It was a couple weeks later after the funeral that my friend began to notice it taking an effect on her mother. At night she could hear her mother still talking to her father in her sleep. She could walk past her mother’s room and see her sitting straight up in bed and hear her saying “Joe, what did you do with it? Why did you leave me? Where did you put everything?” Then she would lie back down and softly cry until she woke later in the morning.
 
Eventually my friend decided to bring it up to her mother. One morning my friend asked her mother about her dreams. Her mother said that she was seeing her husband in her dreams. Each time he would just watch over her and try to fill her with a sense of comfort. My friend’s mother was too stressed out to be consoled. After burying her husband and not having a job of her own, she was in a tight spot financially. She knew that they had silver, jewelry, and a small amount of emergency cash stashed in the house. My friend’s father hid all of those things before they went on vacation to make sure they weren’t stolen in case of a break in. Unfortunately, he never told his wife where he hid them. That is why she was calling out to him, hoping that he would be able to tell her something.
 
A couple days later my friend’s father appeared in a dream to her mother. He told her that the silver was in the garage behind the workbench, the jewelry was behind drywall in the unfinished basement and the cash was tucked underneath the rug in the spare bedroom. He also told her that he would always be there whenever she needed him, forever and always.

It should help illustrate how vulnerable I was in this story.

This story isn't paranormal in any way but it is true and is by far the scariest thing that has ever happened to me.

One weekend when I was about 17 my parents went to Las Vegas for a few days. They left me in charge of the house and told me to drop in every now and then to check in on things, water plants, feed cats, etc.

I left my girlfriends house late that Friday night and decided to stop by the house and grab a change of clothes before heading to a friend's place. I parked my truck in my backyard as was typical for me, being that my house had a small driveway and there was always more room in the yard. The back portion of the house's lot was usually dark as it received very little light from the streetlights in the front of the house, additionally the yard is adjacent to a big concrete wash complete with two very large and creepy drainage tunnels that ran below the street.

However, as I parked the truck I wasn't really thinking about how dark and creepy my yard was. In fact I wasn't really thinking about anything, basically just going through the motions. I walked through my backyard and let myself into the house. I didn't bother turning any lights on until I was in my room.

As soon as I flipped on the switch one of my cats sprinted past me and out my bedroom door, scaring the crap out me as he did so. No harm done, but now my mindset had completely changed. I was suddenly extremely uneasy about the empty house. I decided that leaving as soon as possible was my highest priority. I quickly gathered what I needed and left the room.

As I made my way through the house I decided to grab a quick glass of water before leaving, as I was pretty dehydrated from my recent activities at my girlfriends house. I was still pretty creeped out but I thought I could get away with lingering for a few extra moments. I walked across the kitchen, grabbed a glass, and begin to fill it. The sink I was using was positioned directly below the kitchen window, and as I stood there I peered out from the open blinds. It was dark outside, but I could still see vaguely due to the nearby streetlamps. Everything was bathed in an eery orange glow.

As soon as I turned off the faucet the silence around me was shattered by the most terrifying thing I've ever heard. It was a man's voice, screaming and raving with rage. With each breath he screamed louder and angrier, and it seemed to be more animal than human.

My body shut down and I froze, desperately trying to pinpoint where the sound was coming from.

I could tell right away that he wasn't in the house, but I could tell he wasn't far. No sooner had I come to this realization, is when I saw him. He was in the wash, gripping the front of his shirt with his left hand and swinging at the air with a metal pipe in his right. He was stumbling and raving and screaming while walking away from the tunnel that I assumed he came from. He had short-cropped dark hair, and what was most disturbing to me was what he wearing. He was wearing a dark suit and tie with white sneakers. He just didn't look like an ordinary homeless person or junkie.

Amongst his screaming he stopped and looked straight at me through the window.

As soon as we made eye contact he stared at me for just a moment. I looked back horrified and too afraid to move an inch. Then he broke his gaze and broke off into a sprint, no yelling or stumbling, just a solid sprint until I could no longer see him through the window. I realized at that moment that my back gate was open, my vehicle was back there and my back door was unlocked.

I turned and ran to the back door. I opened it long enough to close and lock the metal gate that shared it's frame and then shut and dead-bolt the door. When I opened the door I thought for sure I would see him running through the yard, but I saw nothing. However, I was convinced that I only had seconds until I heard his body slam against the wrought iron.

I sat down in a corner in my kitchen and scrambled to find my cell phone and call for help.

I phoned the police and gave them my address and information. I stayed on the line until they arrived. They searched everywhere and found nothing. They told me it was most likely a bum or a prank. I didn't really care, I was just glad to leave the place.

The next afternoon as I walked out to my truck to leave my friends house I noticed a metal pipe in the back of my truck, and to this day I am convinced I know exactly how it got there.

2-14-12 - 3:00am
Ok, so I've been doing *really* bad with stomach pains...and this early morning/all day has been the ABSOLUTE FUCKING WORST. I wound up running back and forth from my room to my bathroom every 10 minutes *(I won't sugarcoat it...I couldn't poop.)* and it would wake up E every time I came back in or left. I left at one point and ran to the bathroom, and wound up in a frenzy from pain...and that's when E ran into my bathroom. 
I was shocked because I told her not to come in, but then she began to tell me about the experience that she had...and it was weird as **fuck.**

She said that I had gotten out of bed *(at this point, I was actually in the bathroom)*, and walked towards my door with my iPad in my hands while looking down at it. She told me that she began calling my name..softly at first, and then a little louder and I had stopped when I reached the door...this is when it got weird. She said the door started to creak open slowly without me touching it, and then ""my"" body began to turn towards her; as ""I"" walked towards her, she said her vision went crazy...as if she was having a seizure *(she doesn't know what that's like, but I do and it's what it sounded like)*...she began seeing spots pop before her eyes and the bedside lamp was flickering on and off.
That's when she had had enough.
At that point, she screamed and flipped on the lamp *(which ended up staying on, melting an electric candle that was ontop of it. Sucks.)*, and the occurrence ended. Then she ran to the bathroom.


It was very odd, because when she came into the bathroom and started to tell me what had happened *(I didn't hear much other than she had seen whatever was in the house...I was in pain and wasn't paying attention)*, I began to overheat COMPLETELY. My body began to sweat uncontrollably, I was teetering on the edge of consciousness due to the overheating and pain...and I wound up lying in my bathtub with all my night clothes on as it filled up with freezing cold water. Thus began the worst pain of my life *(and living with daily Migraines, Cluster Migraines and Aura...I know pain. We're close.)*


I don't know what brought this extreme pain on...I don't know if it was just something I ate, or if was connected to whatever had happened to E *(I read up on people who had been possessed or had been through partial-possession, and it paralleled my experience.)*...all I know is that it was the worst pain of my whole fucking life...and I'm glad it's over.

My friend told me that when he was between 5 and 7 years old he awoke one night at about midnight to 2am because there was a strange glow in his room.  When he raised his head from his pillow he saw its source.

There was a door in his room.  That is to say inside his room, stood upright in the middle of his room.  It evidently had a frame around it, and he could see a faint glow emanating from between the door and the frame.  There was no visible means to how the door was standing upright, and craning his neck there was nothing behind it.  He got scared and covered his head under his quilt.  However the door remained no matter how long he hid underneath the quilt cover, and he eventually fell asleep.  In the morning the door was gone.

He still wonders exactly what was behind that door.  He remained adamant that this is true even after years of questions on it.  A childs dream, or something more?  I don't know.

1318500896.0,9,self.Thetruthishere,laofw,"Ghost Road Trip (Bragg Road, Saratoga Texas)",Robert_Tripp,10,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/laofw/ghost_road_trip_bragg_road_saratoga_texas/,"Hey /thetruthishere, recently (thanks a lot to this board) I have become a lot more interested in seeking out the paranormal. Tonight a few friends wanted to go to a commercial haunted house and instead I convinced them to take a trip with me to [Ghost Road (Bragg Road)](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bragg+Rd,+Kountze,+Hardin,+Texas+77625&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=23.875,57.630033&amp;geocode=FWtNzwEdgTxd-g&amp;hnear=Bragg+Rd,+Kountze,+Hardin,+Texas+77625&amp;t=h&amp;z=14&amp;vpsrc=0) in the Big Thicket. I can't imagine a better night for this; full moon and low temperatures. I had been once before when I was in high school with some friends but left empty handed. This time, however, the trip was absolutely phenomenal and we got to experience what all the hype was about.

So, myself and 4 others got ahold of a conversion van for the night. Bragg Road is about 100 miles from where we live so we made a night of it. We got all stocked up with cameras, food, and hooked up an N64 to the TV in the back of the van and were having a hell of a time before we even got to the road. 

When we got there, we stopped right outside the road. We read a paper [explaining some of the things that are reported to happen on this road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_of_Saratoga). The time was about 11:49. I should also add that we were completely alone on this drive. We did not see or hear any other cars the entire time we were in Saratoga.

We finished our smokes and made our way down to the first stopping point. We stopped and read a historical marker and walked around a bit with flashlights. Nothing unusual. 

We continued on to the second stop point with another historical marker. This time, however, we saw a faint yellow light in the distance. It seemed to sway back and fourth, subtly change colors and vary in brightness. Definitely not characteristic of what you would expect headlights to look like (most common debunker of the myth). It appeared for  40-50 seconds and dissipated into the woods. We continued on. It was about 12:28 when this happened.

We drove on for a ways and came to a third historical marker. We decided to set up a hookah there and smoke while sitting in some lawn chairs we brought. We got to the point of bringing the chairs out when we saw it again. It was very faint at first, a yellow amber color flickering in and out of sight. This time, however, the light became gradually brighter. After looking at it for 15 seconds or so, it was clear that the light was coming towards us. All of a sudden, it changed from an amber yellow color to a bright white. Everybody started freaking the fuck out and trying to leave. I stood in the road with my other ballsy friend and waited to see what would happen. At this point we did get some nice shots of the light (2 if I remember correctly) and will post them as soon as I get them from the photographer we had with us. The light was still coming towards us at about the speed of a person jogging. My friends girlfriend was crying at this point so we had to get in the van and head forward. We happened to be going in the same direction as the light, but it shortly vanished once we were driving. Also of possible significance, the temperature felt a very dramatic 15 degrees or so cooler than it did at our last stop. Not sure if that is significant or not; but thought it would be worth mentioning. This all happened at 12:40 or so.

We finished the road, went back the other direction and didn't see anything this time. We called it a night around 2:30 am.

After this trip, I really do believe that there is something unexplained going on. They call it swamp gas, possibly a reflection of distant headlights (although the characteristics of the movement of the light do not at all mimic what headlights look like). The more popular explanation; a decapitated rail road worker is searching for his head. I'm not sure exactly what it is; but it was exciting as hell and plan on going back with more equipment closer to Halloween. 

We got some very good photos of the light, but no video and I don't have them right at this moment. However, this [youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&amp;v=gT51WB9hSLE) looks pretty close to what we experienced. Anybody else ever travel on Bragg Road? Hope you enjoyed the story!

So my buddies brother and a lot of us rented a house about a half mile off the beach. It was a fucking sweet set up. Tons of room and seemed freshly renovated. There were thirteen heads there the prime nights, not one person had to sleep on the floor, fucking sweet minus one crazy bitch, but that's another set of stories for another day.

The first night there is when weird shit happens. There are only five of us there the first night. Two couples and my self. The couples got the rooms with the big beds and shit, so I get stuck in the kids room. Its a big room with a hallway within it and a connecting bathroom. Im sleeping in this giant fucking licoln log bunk bed. Big mattress on the bottom, smaller one on the top. There are actually two of these in this room. So the two couples puss out the first night and Im up late drinking with some other people not staying with us. Around 4 am. I decide to go to bed. I go to the room and turn off the lights. There is some sort of childrens night light thing plugged into the wall. It emits a weak blue light, kind of nice really for when there's a bunch of drunk people in here later im thinking. I lay down and listen to music on my ipod shuffle trying to get tired. A few minutes after I lay down not even before i finish my first song my bed starts shaking. Its sort of a light vibration, my first reaction was that it was my buddies brother banging his girlfriend in the room downstairs. But then i remember that my room is over the living room and infact in the corner of the house. So as I rule that option out, my bed starts shaking a little harder. The next logical thing that pops into my head is that my other friend staying in the connecting room has army crawled into my room down the hallway and is physically shaking my bed, because it literally feels like someone is latched onto the baseboard of the bead. I sit up and look over the footboard truly expecting to see my buddy on the floor laughing at my scared face. There, however, was nothing there, nothing in sight. Im sitting up my my shaking bed which is now shaking even more violently now. Its actually moving so much that the wood that it is made out of is starting to screech as it wobbles. At this point I look over to the other bunk bed and the shelves in the room to see if there is an earthquake going on or something. Nothing else is moving, just my bed. I start to get really scared once I logically rule all these other options out. I want to get out of this bed and run out of the room, but honestly I was so scared to move and so scared to even open any doors afraid of what was behind them.

At this point I say to my self...""well i've never heard of a ghost actually murdering someone"" so i just say fuck it...put my headphones back in, cross my hands behind my head and try not to focus on it. After about a minute or two the bed stopped shaking and after about an hour I finally fell asleep.

This story is getting long so Ill wrap up the rest. The next day I tell my buddy about this shit and we are physically shaking the bed just to the intensity that it begins to make the same sounds. It was quite a lot and my friend was pretty scared at this too. We looked around the house for AC compressors and washer drier to see if anything was maybe attached to a wall and causing the shaking. We really didn't come up with shit. While we were in the process of looking around the house my buddies girlfriend said the couch she was on started shaking, and she thought it was us playing a joke. We come over and inspect the couch...solid as a fucking rock...now were all getting creeped out. Another day passed and my buddies girlfriend was taking a nap in the afternoon, she said her bed started shaking too.

As more and more people came for the wedding, the less weird shit seemed to happen in the house. One morning infact I experienced the same bed shaking phenomenon to a lesser degree, but this time there were three other people drunk and passed out in the room with me. It was maybe about 9 or 10 am. I looked around to say something to someone, but these fucks were passed out hard snoring, they didn't give a shit. Neither did I really, I was like fuck you ghost, I got my drunk sleeping posse. I just said fuck it and went back to sleep.

So one night late were back at the house sitting on the front porch in the dark, drinking beers and talking about all sorts of weird shit. One of the guys staying here comes walking back from the bars with a local girl...props...she was pretty ugly and sort of weird looking, but props none the less. She joins our weird conversation and turns out to be pretty cool actually. She was saying weird shit too so I decide to see what she thinks about ghosts. I say in an almost jokingly fashion ""yeah, so this house right here is fucking haunted as shit by the way"". The girl serious as fuck poker face was like...""no shit, this whole island is haunted. dont you know they used to call this place graveyard island"" I had no clue what the fuck she was talking about, but I see in a gift shop later that week ""tales from graveyard island"" a book on the local ghost stories. Im not saying I saw a ghost for sure, but chalk that shit up in the fucking book of graveyard island tales.

So a couple months ago, I had my family had my cousin over, her being substantially older than me, just for shits and giggles. We were shooting the shit for a while and somehow the topic of psychics came up. The usual conversations ensued between family members, ""They're not real"", ""My friend visited one and she told him that ____"", etc.

At one point she started telling us of a psychic her and her family became close friends with, although they never knew he was a psychic. Well she started telling us how he would be asked by friends to tell them their future, he did, and all of his predictions were true, one would get married, another would lose a close relative, and another would get a great job, he even saw my cousin's brother's car and told my cousin ""That's your brother huh? even though she had never told him about him, and they had never met. Up to this point, as I always think about these things, I didn't believe her. Then she said, she went to go see him to ""get her future"" as well. He told her something ""horrible would happen to someone close to her"" At this point my asshole got tight, as I was leaving back to school 2000 miles away. 

Well she got us intrigued and we asked her to tell us more about his friend. He came from a long lineage of psychics. She told us how he dropped everything and left his home in the middle east without telling anyone (can't remember where exactly) to come here. His family forbade that their ""gift"" be used for fun. His father, after finding out his son was telling people their future, decided he was doing exactly this. So my cousin tells me that the guys dad found him, even though his son never gave his family any information. Apparently his dad disowned him after the visit, and they never saw each other after that.

My cousin then tells me one of the most bone-chilling stories I've heard to date. My cousin, the psychic, and two of their friends, went out for drinks one night. They came back at around 3:00am and were headed to their friends house to drop her off. On the way there, at a stoplight, they saw a man sitting on a suitcase. To give you a picture, imagine a part of downtown where there are abandoned building, brush, shitty streets etc. and the bus-stop was just a sign on a metal post, and he was sitting against the post on the suitcase, and the brush in the back, next to a stoplight. Anyways, they thought nothing of it, and farther down the road my cousin and the other friend were joking about the ""hobo"" they saw at the bus stop. The psychic friend then says, that was death. My cousin and her friend then shut up and got scared. The psychic then told them if they wanted to go back and see him again, but if they did, they would have to shake his hand, or there would be a disaster in their lives. They refused and kept on going back home.

(fast-forward to a few days ago)
My cousin came back, and for some reason the friend came up in a conversation again. As I said before, he had predicted something horrible would happen to someone close, and it did. The psychic himself was hit by a bus. She also told me he had asked to meet me, because he had to tell me something.

I have my own experiences with the paranormal, but I though /r/NoSleep would appreciate this one the most.

A quick background:

I go to school in Poland (where this story occurs) and have no worries of people finding my information, but I will change the name of my friends.

Most of us students live in dormitories or apartments. A group of my acquaintances (one of which I am good friends with, let's call him Charles) decided to, however, rent a house. The found a real estate agent (there were 6 or 7 of them going to be living in the house) and were shown a house. It was the closest to school, and the biggest. The rent was too cheap, which Charles now says should have been a tip-off.

They decide to move in and spend the first night smoking cigarettes and drinking cheap wine. No problems so far.

The next night, as they continue the same binging, one of them (let's call him Mitch) has a funny feeling. He doesn't like the house but tells no one. Later in the night, they notice (from the house behind theirs) that there is old lady looking out her window at the house and them. This continues for many nights, all the while Mitch hides his feelings.

I must mention that when my friends moved in, nearly everything was left behind by the old tenants. They left in a hurry. This house was in the last German neighborhood of the city I live in Poland. My friends ask the real estate agent about the old lady and he tells them that she is the mother of the dad who lived there before (a family of 4 or 5).

As they begin to move in, they explore a shed in the backyard. Inside are wheelbarrows full of mutilated doll parts.

At this point, the rest of my friends begin to get creeped out by the combination of the old lady staring at them every night and the contents of the shed. Mitch opens up to Charles and begins to express his worries and fears.

Time progresses and Mitch begins to get paranoid. He starts accusing his friends that they are out to get him and that they are all convinced he is a ""faggot."" This worsens over the next few days and he eventually isolates himself completely and stops attending classes.

Everyone around him is worried for him and contemplate calling his parents back in the States, but choose not to because they think he will get past it.

My friends go over to the old lady's house to try and find out why she is being so creepy. The language barrier prevents them from doing so.

One night all of my friends go out to a club. My friend Charles is the last to leave with another friend of his. They lock the door behind them (there was only one key among the 6 or 7 guys; strange, I know). When the return, all of them are together. They unlock the front door and right in front of them, on the wall is a portrait/painting of the young girl who had lived there before. The painting was, when they left, upstairs, in the master bedroom. It had somehow managed to find itself on the wall, downstairs, placed sideways. There were no nails holding it up. They tear down the picture, throw it away, and everyone finds another place to sleep that night.

Some of the guys, after a night or two, return to the house to stay. The rest moved out for good. Well, eventually, Mitch's condition worsens. He is now punching walls and yelling at everyone on a nightly basis, convinced that everyone thinks that he is a ""faggot."" He begins to hear voices. At this point, the guys all decide to call his parents. Mitch's brother was also attending a medical school elsewhere in Europe and was on his way home. He changed his plane ticket so he could go to Poland and pick up Mitch to take him home.

There are now 3-4 guys there out of the original 6 or 7. They return class one day, only to find the entire collection of mutilated doll parts in each of the sinks and bathtubs of the house.

They had enough and left, only returning (with a school representative, and the real estate agent) to pack their belongings.

Our speculation was that the old lady who lived in the house behind theirs was trying to keep a watchful eye on them as she knew that the house was haunted.

Somewhere between 1 and 3 am. The stretch of road I was driving goes through the back end of a couple of counties in the Deep South. Nothing around but forests, fields, and the occasional group of shacks huddling under a light that only barely keeps away the night. I'd driven this stretch of road many times before, even at this time of night, so it wasn't really a big deal. Just a long trip. Since there was rarely any traffic that time of night (during the day you could always count on at least a handful of cars somewhere around), I was able to turn the stereo up and push the pedal down.

And then I came to this bridge. Nothing really noteworthy about it - it's not ancient or a covered bridge or all that spooky. Just a concrete span over swampland, trees growing right up near the edge and turning the road into a dim trail at the bottom of a dark canyon. I'd been over this bridge many times before and aside from being fairly long, it wasn't really noteworthy. Until that night.

It was humid out and as the temperature dropped there was a little bit of fog. Not enough to really slow me down, but I had to turn off the high-beams. So I'm shooting across the bridge and it hits me that it seems to be taking longer than normal to get across it. Maybe I was just tired? Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me?

And then I thought I was finally getting to the end of it, I saw a figure walking on the opposite side of the road. At first, no big deal, right? Guy walking in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night. Probably lives nearby, probably drunk. Watch them to make sure they don't fall in front of the car.

But my mind is already racing. I mean, this is the middle of nowhere. There are no houses around. There are no lights but the stars and my headlights stabbing out at the darkness.

And as I whiz by going way too fast for my own good, I notice two things: First. the figure is wearing what appears to be a straight jacket, the sleeves undone, and the straps trailing to the ground. Glaring white against the background of the night. No mistaking it. A straight jacket, hands covered, straps dangling and waving as he walked. Second. It has no face. Not like, there's no head there. There's a head shape. And the place where a face should be, but no face. Just an expanse of darkness that I took to be his skin.

I chalked it up to going really fast, contrast between white jacket and dark skin at night, and thinking creepy thoughts. I mean, surely I couldn't have just seen that. I tried to spot him in my rear view mirror, but it was so dark there was nothing to be seen. I slowed down a little, and was suddenly off the end of the bridge and on normal two-lane blacktop again.

I briefly considered turning around, seeing what it was. Surely it was just a trick of the light or my mind playing tricks on me. Right?

But I still remember being my heart pounding and fear as I sped on through the darkness, driving home.

Well, about four years later, my family made another trip back to India and I was looking forward to spending some time with my cousins, especially Gopal.

It turns out that Gopal had decided to move to another village close-by to help them out with a few problems. Gopal was pretty smart and really handy around farm equipment and machinery, and he ended up working on some of their cars and other machines. At any rate, he wasn't really around much, which was a bit of a disappointment to me. Instead of staying at his place with his dad, we ended up staying with one of my mom's uncle's, Viru.

We all got along great with my mom's Viru-mama. (Most Indian languages have different names for your four kinds of aunts and uncles. 'Mama' is your mother's brother, and 'mami' is his wife.) He was actually only about ten years older than my mom, so all of us kids called him 'mama,' too. His wife was really awesome, like a second mother, and her name was Sushila. He was really down-to-earth. His older son, Kalpit (about 32), daughter-in-law Jaya (about 30, Kalpit's wife), his younger son Bankim (about 26), and daughter-in-law Prabha (about 26, Bankim's wife) all lived with him. He had a pretty spacious house and though the village wasn't a farming one, they did grow a lot of their own stuff themselves. Kalpit and Bankim were pretty ripped from doing a lot of work outside.

We all got along well despite my brother and I being much younger than them, and we spent a lot of nights playing card games into the wee hours of the morning. Usually Bankim and Prabha would be up with us, but Kalpit and Jaya would go to bed early. Kalpit would usually take care of the earlier chores, and Jaya took care of breakfast, now that Sushila was getting older. Since they had a nice sized family, everything was pretty well-managing in shifts and things got done easily, at least until some children came into the picture a year or two later.

Well, we joked and teased my family back and forth, especially since Jaya and Kalpit hadn't had any kids and they were 30 (well-past the normal age in rural India). They laughed along saying they'd get to it and so forth, but something seemed amiss. My dad seemed to notice it first, but wouldn't really say anything. My mom talked to Sushila-mami the next day and then told us not to tease them so much. They had had some problems in that area, miscarriages and so forth.

Jaya was pretty skinny. She wasn't malnourished, but she had a really high metabolism and she was also a little on this shorter side, only about 5'3"" (1.6m), and it seemed that this was the root of the problem. After we found out, we started to try to help by getting her to eat some more, drink more water and milk, and in general offer some emotional support. I got really close to her and she felt like she could confide some her fears and secrets to me, and over a few days she seemed to be in higher spirits.

A few nights before we were supposed to leave, we were all up late playing cards and eating some home-made sweets when Jaya just up and drops her glass of milk. Indian household (especially rustic ones) often use metal plates (called thaalis) and cups, so when it fell, out rang this metallic clang and hum. The milk was everywhere and we all turned to see Jaya slumped on the floor.

Kalpit and I rushed over and lifted her by her arms and put her back on her chair. Her head lolled. Prabha went to get some cool water and Viru-mama helped us move her over to the sofa, which was more like a daybed. Sushila-mami sprinkled some water on her since she was burning with a fever, and she suddenly screeched.

Her eyes snapped open and she flicked her arm away, pushing me several feet in the opposite direction. I looked back and she didn't really look like herself anymore. Bankim had taken my spot, at her hand, but he was holding her down now, as was Kalpit. A look of sadness filled both of their faces. Prabha told my parents and my brother to check on me, and to stay back. Sushila-mami brought out a book from somewhere and Prabha brought some holy water (from the Ganges).

Apparently, they were used to this scene. I watched on, as Jaya started screeching and thriving on the bed, trying desperately to throw off Kalpit and Bankim. Prabha started chanting from the book, tears streaming down her cheeks. It was a collection of some hymns, a few I knew from the Rig Veda, some parts from the Bhagavad Gita. I had started studying some Sanskrit at the time, enough to the point where I could recognize some of the verses here and there.

All through this, Jaya kept shouting and screaming.

""SHHHHHHEEEEEEEEERRR!!! SSSSHHHHHHEEEEEEEERRR!!""

Like I said, she was on the small-side. Bankim and Kalpit should have easily been able to hold her down, but she used some ridiculous strength to fight them. She actually managed to throw off Kalpit at one point and was working on Bankim when I ran up and tried to help restrain her. Up close, even I could feel her intensity. Then I noticed her eyes.

Jaya, like most native Indians, had brown eyes. Big, beautiful brown eyes. Only what I was looking at weren't brown. They were a bright, brilliant blue. Her eye color had changed completely. And in that spotless, brilliant blue, I didn't see rage or anger, I saw fear.

Then Prabha started chanting the Hanuman Chalisa, and Sushila started to sprinkle some Ganga jal on to her every so often, and she immediately started writhing a bit. She had severely calmed down, but she kept rocking her head and limbs back and forth, mumbling softly.

""The worst of it is over,"" Kalpit said, as he let her go. Her arm slumped down, though our Jaya wasn't back. I looked up at him, stunned, and he said, ""It's been like this since we started to try for kids. Every so often, she goes into these fits. Prabha's Sanskrit is good, so she chants some prayers, and she calms down. Eventually Jaya comes back and she's fine for a few months.""

He dejectedly sat down. My mom, being ever the pragmatic one, asked, ""What is she saying?""

Viru-mama said, ""We don't know. We can't understand her. Prabha thought she said 'kshiira'.""

Jaya moaned next me, ""Sheer. Sheer."" She looked up and her eyes met mine, longingly.

Bankim took up the story. ""That means 'milk' in Sanskrit. We gave her some milk, and then she started talking, but we only picked up a little. It sounded like Hindi, but was really different at time. It definitely wasn't Gujarati, and if it was Sanskrit, then Prabha would've known.""

""Sheer.""

I couldn't bear it anymore.

""Bhai, get me some milk, quick."" My brother dashed off, and I asked Prabha to stop. I guess she was sort of listening, cuz she nodded, but the kept the book open in case Jaya started a fit again.

Jaya stopped writhing and lay still, but she didn't try to fight us.

""I have to meet him. Please, let me go. I have to meet him tonight."" Jaya's eyes locked on mine.

""Dad, it's Urdu."" Common Urdu and Hindi are essentially spoken the same way nowadays, even though their scripts differ. Hindi in the news is largely Sanskritized, so as to be more ""Indian,"" but Urdu is largely Persianized. My ears perked at some of the borrowed Persian words, and her pronunciation.

""We're getting you milk. Who do you need to meet?"" I tried to respond in Hindi, my effort embarrassingly clumsy at best, but she seemed to get it.

""My fiance. He's at home and I need to get back. He said he'd come meet me in the city and he never came! I need to meet him, TONIGHT!"" This was definitely not Jaya's voice. It was much deeper, still womanly, but more breathy. Some of the sounds she was making were definitely Persian. The way she said ""mulaaqaat,"" for example.

My dad talked to her and tried to get more info, but she just kept repeating herself.

My brother brought the cup of milk and gave it to her, but she didn't drink it. She started to move and Prabha started to chant again, but my mom stopped her.

""Let's help her up, and see where she goes.""

Bankim and Kalpit basically carried her out of the house towards the road, her pointing with her hand, and my dad and me trying to help translate. We went up the road a bit until she asked us to stop.

Fuck, if I thought things were weird before...

The dew was setting, and a low fog sort of came up the road. Jaya apparently got her strength back, because all of a sudden, she ran forwards a bit, pushing Bankim and Kalpit out of the way. She didn't even spill a drop of milk.

About 10 feet ahead, she beamed and started talking really excitedly. We didn't want to move closer and we couldn't really hear well from where we were, so we just kind of watched. She lifted up her cup and tilted it forwards, as if she were making someone drink from it. We watched as the whole cup tipped until it was almost horizontal, and no milk came out. Then, she fell over.

We rushed to her side to see if she was okay but she was totally passed out. We looked around for the glass, and it was set straight up in the dirt, empty. There was no milk anywhere around.

She came to a little while later, after she was carried back inside. She had no recollection of what happened at all.

When we saw them on our next trip, 4 years later, Viru-mama said she hadn't had any fits and things were good, especially with her 3- and 2-year old kids making mischief. At one point, Jaya and I were alone, and she mentioned that she had had some really vivid dreams that she only told Kalpit about, and another incident.

The whole family had gone with Gopal's parents to the next village over to see him. She and Prabha stayed home with the kids for a night or two, and some of the older kids around the village helped them out with the chores. Jaya heard Prabha screech in the middle of the night and went to go find her, but she was gone.

Jaya wandered around the whole house, and then ran outside and noticed her in the middle of the road. When she got close by, Prabha just collapsed. Jaya's eyes widened a bit and as she whispered in hushed tones -

""There was a cup, floating in the air nearby. I've never seen anything like it and I was so afraid! Then, it slowly floated down and set itself on the ground. After that, Prabha woke up. She never remembered anything, either. I guess I see why you were all so afraid, too.""

Then her 3-year-old ran into the room. She put her arms around him, smiling and saying, ""Looks like you and your brother will have some more playmates soon!""

1376056133.0,10,self.Thetruthishere,1k0wq5,[ME][FAM] Weird goings on in my old house,Morshy,14,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1k0wq5/mefam_weird_goings_on_in_my_old_house/,"Sorry for the random title for this post but I wasn't sure what to call it - hence why I am writing it on here!  I have been an avid reader of this message board in the last few weeks, so hoping you could shed some light on some of my experiences...

When I was a kid I lived in a different house to the one I live in now.  There was nothing particularly spooky about my old house, was in a well lit street surrounded by other houses and neighbours, and it wasn't built on a dodgy Indian Burial Ground or anything else that I know of.  For some reason though, my sister and I have always felt that there was something a bit weird about the house.

We had a staircase that ran up the left hand side of the wall in the passage, so you saw it as soon as you opened the door.  It was straight, but then the top 4 steps curved around to the right, leading to the upstairs.  The 4th step down was wide, as it was the beginning of the curve so was thicker next to the wall (if you catch my drift).  My sister and I both hated that part of the stairs, as always the entire staircase was lit pretty well, it just always seemed a tad darker than the rest of the house, like there was a constant shadow on it.  I also hated sitting in the chair next to the door in my front room, as in that chair I could turn my head to the left and look behind me to see that spot on the stairs through the banisters.  I also remember me being a really bad sleeper when I was a kid, constantly waking up and being PETRIFIED in the middle of the night and calling out for my parents.  When talking to my mum about it now she doesn't recall me being problematic, but I remember it being a nightly thing for a good for months, if not longer.  That might just be me thinking it was a lot worse than it was though as I was young, but I remember calling my mum and saying there was a man standing in my room a lot.  To the point where even when I was 12-13 I had a tiny little night light in my room because I was still so scared of the dark.

Anyway, cutting to the actual story.  I remember it being broad daylight once, and I hadn't been home from school that long.  The house was empty, parents at work and my sister still not home from school.  I was sitting in my front room on the floor, leaning with my back on the sofa watching the tv, so was facing the windows out onto my driveway and the road.  I remember hearing a noise and looking up to see my sister walking down the driveway.   I watched her for a few seconds and looked back at the tv.  I heard her put her key in the lock, open the door, step into the house and close the door, then there was silence.  I didn't think anything of it for a few minutes, but then when I heard literally no noise I called out to her asking what she was doing - no response.  I got up to walk out in the corridor to ask her what was up, and when I got out there, there was no one there.  She wouldn't have been able to get upstairs as I would have heard her, and there was no response when I called her name.  I instantly shit a million bricks and felt intense panic and like I needed to get out of the house.  I grabbed my keys and ran out the door, not even sure what I was going to do but knowing I had to get out of the house.  I ran to the top of the driveway and as I looked down the road, saw my sister walking down it on her way back from school.  I freaked out a bit, asking her why she was letting herself in and going outside again without saying anything but she insisted she hadn't been home yet.  She still had her school books and everything with her.  I was honestly freaked.

My sister had a similar experience once too.  She was in the shower and we had all gone out, myself and my parents.  Again, it was late in the afternoon, and my sister had a stack of school books in her room.  As she'd just got back from school, she spent time stacking the school books in height order onto her floor next to her chest of drawers, so they wouldn't fall over.  She did this, and then went and got in the shower.  Once in the shower, she heard a massive CRASH.  She jumped out and ran into her room to see the books all over the floor, like they'd been thrown or kicked.  She ran into my room, thinking I had got home from school and done it and she just hadn't heard me becuase she was in the shower.  She opened my door, and obviously I wasn't there.  She instantly shit herself too, chucked on some clothes and did the same thing, went to run down the stairs to get out of the house.  As she got halfway down the stairs I opened the door just getting in from school.  Exactly the same, slightly annoyed but terrified she starts shouting at me asking me why I kicked her books over and ran out of the house.  I swear blind I hadn't been home and was just getting in then.  Weird.

Apologies for the long post, but we still randomly talk about these 2 events to this day as it's just unexplainable.  Neither of us particularly liked that house, there were weird vibes in it.  In terms of my story, I just wondered if anyone had previous experince with being convinced they see and hear a friend/family member, only to realise that it was just in their imagination or.. worse?  I didn't imagine my sister coming home, I saw her, heard her and anticipated her coming into the front room and she just wasn't there?

So here it is, there is a little girl in my house about 10 years old. I have come in contact with her a few times. She likes to turn on lights, close and shut cabinet doors, and she likes to let people know that it is her place if there is someone in the house she does not like. 

When I first stayed the night there I spoke to her in a dream. But she was not like the woman in my last dream. In my other dream the woman looked just like you or me. This little girl was like the typical ""ghost"" You would see in a movie. Like think a ghost from the rift in Doctor who. More transparent and blue. 

At first I did  not know what was going on. This was the first night I stayed there out of all the times I had been there. And this was the first time I had seen her. She was sweet at first. I managed to gather that her name was lucy and she didnt know she was dead at first. I am still not convinced that she knows she is dead, just by the way she acts, sometimes. She gets really bratty and I personally dont like speaking with her. She wouldnt let me wake up the first time i saw her in a dream. She kept asking me to play (but as a child after 100 years of being unnoticed, wouldnt you ask someone to stay, too?) But she wasnt nice when I had to force myself awake. almost as if she was holding my hand for me to stay. ( I at first thought it was a weird dream and it was sleep paralysis, though it could very well have been, but everytime I see her, she looks like she did in my dream. Being it was the first night I stayed there, I thought it was a weird dream, but when I moved in, things like the following started happening.) 

She has people she likes  that come by all the time (like my boyfriend) and if that person there she will as ""why"" or ""where are they"". She liked to follow him to the bathroom and what not when I first was getting to know him. She liked him a lot. But now is sort of hes there all the time, so it doesnt matter. 

She will sit and watch childrens show or movies and stuff with me when I am home alone. Which I have never had before. But hey! there is a first time for everything. Sometimes at night I used to hear cabinets closing and opening. Dishes rattling in the kitchen, minor things like that. I woke up one morning and the living room light was on when I wasnt in that room at all that day and my roommate was not home. And another time she did this was when I brought my boyfriends sister into the house. His sister said she heard a deep breathing. Though I had felt a weird force in the room, I didnt hear anything and no fans were on. When we walked out, there were two lights She even remembers me turning off that urned back on in the house. And I told her ""oh, its the little girl in the house, I dont know why she does that"" and at that moment she looked at me and her eyes widened and she told me that she felt breathing on her neck and she heard it and it was heavy. She said she was gonna ask if a fan was on, but she didnt. But no, there were no fans on in that house. 

That is all I have for the little girl, but there is another on in my basement. This one is weird. He likes to be a lone. All the time. He gets really angry if you dont do what you need to do and leave or if you stay down there too long. Ususallly he gets furious if I go down there alone. I dont ahve too much to say about him, but he usually just sits in a corner. one corner or another and just kind of pouts. that is what is seems like to me, anyways. I am sure he knows he is dead. But he does not want to leave earth, and for what reason, I do not know. I just know he likes to stay in the basement. He will reach the stairs to chase me out, it feels like if I am there too long. But that is it. 

those are the stories for the day and I will post more as I remember.

I think this one has stuck with the the most.

I little background education is required to understand the events that follow. In the Christian faith, it is believed that when you are saved the blood of Christ covers you in a spiritual sense. This way when God looks at you He does not see your sin, instead He sees the pure blood of His Son.

My mom had not seen one of her high school friends, who we will call Jill, in a number of years. One summer while she was home on break, she happened to run into Jill. She approached her expecting to catch up with an old friend. As she walked up to Jill, Jill leaned her head back until she was staring straight up into the sky. When she brought her gaze back down, her eyes were both completely blacked out. Not dilated, black. She looked at my mom and said, ""I see the blood on you."" She then turned and walked away. My mom never ran into that woman again.

1371875562.0,10,self.Thetruthishere,1gu9fr,[ME]: The man with the hat,cihuacoatl,22,12,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gu9fr/me_the_man_with_the_hat/,"Hello everyone in /r/Thetruthishere/. I had been lurking a bit in this subreddit before I decided to share some of my experiences with the ""paranormal"". I know this is non-fiction subreddit, and well, none of this is fiction. Is very, very real.

First of all, I have to explain some things before I tell you about the man with the hat.

I have always seen shadow people. My mom says that when I was a baby, I used to cry a lot because there was a ""man"" in the apartment we lived in. The building was old (from the 40's) and many people had experiences in there. I remember the housekeeper had some pretty bad ones. I remember seeing shadow people, and more than once, hearing them calling me. I was also terrified of my closet because it was unusually dark (at least, I believed it was), but eventually, it all stopped around the time I was 8.

We moved to another apartment building when I was 14. The place was built in the 60's, and we got a pretty good deal for the apartment, so we were happy to own our place (we rented before that). I remember people used to tell us that they kept seeing a little girl inside the apartment, even when everyone knew it had been abandoned for almost 10 years. As soon as we moved in, I noticed there were doors opening and closing on their own, shadows walking in the living room and strange voices in the night. It all stopped after a few months, and we lived without worries for almost four years.

I was 17 at the time we began having problems with one of the neighbours. She was a very problematic person, who used to bully people to get what she wanted. People also said she was a witch. Anyway, this woman accused my father and another neighbour (who was our friend) of stealing money (my dad and this other guy were the administrators of the building...I don't know if this happens in another countries, but here building administrators handle the money for all the needs of the common areas of the building: cleaning, electricity, employees, and so on.). In the end, my dad and our friend were cleared because evidently, the woman was lying, but she was very angry at us.

It was when the man in the hat visited me.

My apartment was in the floor level, just in front of the problematic neighbour's place. Between the apartments, there was a small garden, and my bedroom faced her apartment. I caught her spying through the window many, many times, and I really disliked to know she could be watching me anytime. I kept the curtains closed always, and felt really uncomfortable because my bed was right next to the window, but since my room was really small, I could not move it elsewhere.

Well, one night, I had gone to bed around 10 PM, and was trying to sleep, but couldn't. I stirred in my bed, eyes closed, for around two hours. Finally, I lay in bed for around twenty more minutes, staring at the bottom of the top bed of the bunk (I used to sleep in a bunk bed). Then I saw him. He walked right through the window, in front of my bed, then crossed the small room, and walked through the door, exiting the room.

I lay frozen in my bed. I had just seen a man, around 50 years old, wearing a black/dark grey suit and a hat, walk past my room. I immediately started praying to the Gods (let me also clarify that I had recently converted to Wicca).

After a while, I fell asleep in tears. I was soundly asleep when I was woken by the noise of a poster falling from my wall. In those days, I was a big fan of the anime Sailor Moon, and I had a huge poster in my wall, just next to my bed. It was secure in the wall, with tape and thumbtacks so it wouldn't fall.

Well the poster fell, bringing down with it some stuff I had in my nightstand. I woke up truly terrified, but quickly decided it had ""just fell"". I got up, placed the poster back, re arranged the fallen stuff, and went back to bed.

It was no more than two minutes, and I was perfectly awake when, I swear, I felt something bitting me between the shoulder and the neck. It was really quick, and I jumped out of my bed while at the same time I turned the lights on.

Evidently, I saw nothing, but I could feel there was something there. I suppose I could have been really scared, but I was not. I was furious. I remember I felt like beating the crap out of that thing that had just bit me. So I yelled at it. I told him (pardon my language) to get the f**k out my house, that he was messing with someone who was not going down without fighting and that if he wanted to play, well, it was on.

In retrospective, I might have been reckless..but I clearly remember not feeling afraid. I *knew* what to do. I took some water in a glass, added salt to it, and sprinkled the whole room with the liquid. Then I smudged the place with sandalwood incense, not missing one spot. I payed special attention to the window. All the time, I kept repeating to myself that the Gods were with me and that they were kicking this bast*rd out of my house.

My mom opened the door, catching me with the incense and questioned me. I explained everything. Being the skeptic she is, she said it was just a dream, but deep in her eyes, she was worried. She left, and returned a few moments later with some Holy Water (she's Catholic) and said, ""Well, this might strengthen your spell. Good night"".

As I said, I'm a Wiccan, so I really don’t give much credit to Holy Water (most of the time, the blessings of water in churches are so damn impersonal…) but I think that my mom's desire to help me and keep me safe was what strengthened my protections. I placed a glass with Holy Water, next to a glass with Consecrated Water, in the window.

The man never came back, and I am certain I kicked his ugly butt off my house with the help of the Gods.

That was the first time I battled something dark, and I won. Nonetheless, I still remember the horrible sensation of cold, sharp teeth sinking into my flesh. The attack left no marks, and it didn't change me in any way (I say so because someone asked me ""And did you turn into a vampire or something?” The person was pretty serious about this question). I know this thing was bullying me, and I suspect it was there because this woman (the neighbour) sent it somehow. Maybe she didn't even do it consciously, but it was too much of a coincidence that the man came from the area shared by our apartments.

As I said, this was the first time I battled something. The first, but not the last. I will share some other experiences later.

I just have one question. Has anyone had a similar experience? Has something physically attacked you, leaving no marks?

Anyway, thanks for enduring the wall of text. I'd like to know what you have to say.

I had read about sleep paralysis before, so during both of these encounters, I figured that that's what was happening and possibly wasn't as scared as I would have been otherwise.

The first time was in December of 2009, a few days after I returned home from college for winter break. I woke up really late in the afternoon, like 3pm (don't judge, I've long since corrected my sleeping habits), and the second I woke up, I felt something sit on the edge of my bed behind my back. Then I start feeling whatever it was shifting its weight on top of me, like someone was climbing on me. It kept applying more and more pressure. My eyes were open the whole time, but I was facing a wall and I was too frightened to glance up to see if anyone/anything was actually there. I never hallucinated or anything. It went on for no more than a minute before my dog barked downstairs and I snapped out of it. I was really creeped out, comforted only by the fact that I would be getting on a plane and going to Cancun that night and wouldn't have to sleep in that room again for 5 more days

The second time was in January of 2012, so a little over two years later. I woke up in my apartment at school (again, very late in the afternoon). This time I had fallen asleep with the top sheet over my head so I couldn't really see anything besides the red sheet above me. Again, right after I woke up I felt someone or something get on the bed, this time approaching from the base edge. And just like last time, It felt like the person/thing was slowly creeping further on top of me, applying more and more weight. I also swear it looked like the sheet was bring manipulated above me, but that was likely a hallucination. While this was going on, I could hear two of my roommates and a girl having a conversation seemingly right outside my bedroom door. I tried to call out their names but I couldn't speak. After a minute or so, I snapped out of it. When I asked my roommates later, they both denied having been talking outside of my door and a girl having been in our apartment.

What makes these encounters different from others' accounts of sleep paralysis is that 

1) I was asleep on my side - most report that they were on their backs
2) I did not wake up with the weight on me, it shifted onto me
3) I didn't hallucinate (the first time at least)

My eyes was already open, the room took back it's normal shape. No ghost, the clock sounds turn out to be the cofee machine's steam.
I turn on the tv: Poltergeist and Ghost by Steven Spielburg was playing. I watched it anyway. When I had enogh, I walked in the street, which is located in a forest (I was at my friend house, far from the city). I was frightened and I recorded the sound of the animals to keep a souvenir from that night.
When I recorded I saw mouvement on the screen, so I looked at it. The light was almost vanished. I waited, eyes lock on the screen, craving to see more activity. I thought nothing more happened, so I stop recording.
But when I saw the video again I noticed a second luminous spectre. When i'm saying the french word ''bordel'' at the end, a second luminous spectre appear around the light on the left. It is clearer if you download it from mediafire.
I hate myself for not recording my entire walk, back to my friend house. But If you know any talent video editor, it would be cool to ask them to analyse it. It could be a credible paranormal proof for which case you would of participate!

I don't like to drive on highways, so I took the scenic route through the towns.  

It was probably around 10pm.  It was a pitch black night, with no lights along this particular stretch.  Along the right side of the road, there was a very long white picket fence with a large pasture on the other side.

Very faintly, I saw a large white animal running full speed toward the road on all fours.  It must've been as big as a tiger or lion (possiby bigger and longer), but very similar to the [Borzoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borzoi) or Afghan hound breed of dog.  I didn't get that great a look at it, but that's the closest thing to it I could find.

It was timed so that it reached the road a few seconds after I passed it.  I looked back in the rear view mirror, but could not see anything.

I'm guessing it was probably a lost dog running around at night, but it was still very creepy.  To be driving at night, and see a huge white animal running toward your car out of a field in complete darkness.

Any objective opinions on what limited things I got would be greatly appreciated.

This happened a little over two years ago when I was attending college in Florida. One of my friends, let's call him Kevin, came over one night near the end of a very long semester and told my roommate (we'll call him Mark) and I a story about how he had recently had a paranormal experience in the woods near some celery fields that were nearby. Of course Mark took this with a grain of salt, but I was slightly more believing since I had an interest in the paranormal/urban legends. So we decided to go investigate.

When we got there, Kevin parked his car on the side of a dirt road that was fairly off of the beaten path. Deciding that we wanted to get some sort of concrete evidence if anything happened, we decided to use my iPhone as a makeshift EVP recorder. I pressed record, and we went into the woods. We were going to a clearing that had several strange stick formations that Kevin had been telling us about. On the way, we experienced some weird shit.

We all had the distinct feeling like we were being watched by... something. Then off in the distance we heard rustling. Now a normal person would think ""Duh you're in the woods. It's probably just an animal or something"", but we started hearing it the moment we stepped in the woods. Eventually we [stopped](http://soundcloud.com/ghosthunt/clip-1) and started our EVP work. After a few minutes we continued on, but we kept hearing this rustling sound, so Kevin decided to [try something out](http://soundcloud.com/ghosthunt/clip-2). After that we came across a few strange stick formations in the ground that were in the shape of an X. Mark, being the dumbass he is, pulled it out of the ground at which point Kevin and I started freaking out at him. 

Eventually, we found the clearing Kevin was talking about and right in the center was a large log. We all sat down and started our very informal [investigation](http://soundcloud.com/ghosthunt/clip-3). I was cracking jokes to lighten the mood since we were all feeling really uneasy. After a while we decided to leave because Kevin thought he saw something large moving in the distance.

On the way back we kept hearing the same rustling sound and could not shake the feeling that something was following us. All three of us stopped dead cold. While none of us were moving I heard the distinct sound of someone getting a [running start](http://soundcloud.com/ghosthunt/clip-4). So instinctively, I started to run, which made everyone else run. We all ran back to the car and got the hell out of there. It wasn't until i started listening to the EVP on the way back that I discovered all of the sounds in the clips above. I haven't gone back since.

I will say this, some of the stuff is difficult to hear because A. I was only using a phone and not a quality recording device and B. The ambient sounds in the woods. I like using the third clip as a reference point because that's the only one where all three of us talk at one point so you can hear the distinction between our voices and what I felt was an ""otherworldly voice"".",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,t3_148y9v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/148y9v/me_frs_the_celery_fields/,

The places is definitely haunted and I thought I would share a few of everyone's experiences here. Her mother and step-father don't believe but we do.

Her brother said that when he was little he would see things coming out of his closet, shadow-like figures. The main story that he told me about was one where he was younger and his cousin and himself were sleeping in the room and saw a shadow figure sort of appear in the closet and start coming towards them. I'm not sure what they did about this situation but he was definitely freaked out about it. He has also seen shadow figures out of the corner of his eyes, mostly in his room.

My girlfriend and her brother have seen a man standing at their back door (which leads to their fenced-in patio) in a trench coat. My girlfriend said that they believe it is the spirit of a man who lived in this house and had a heart attack and died. We tried to do some ownership/property deed searching online and came up with no results.

My girlfriend also heard her name being called through the heating vent in her room when she was back in high school. She was on the phone with her friend Caree and it was loud enough to were they both heard it.

My girlfriend and I have also shared an experience. She was getting ready for work one day in her mothers room while I was sleeping in ours. She was using a makeup mirror and swear that she heard someone come up behind her. She thought it was me trying to prank her (I do it often) and looked in the mirror. She saw a shadow move in the mirror and when she looked behind her nothing was there. She also says that when she realized she was alone someone had been talking the entire time, and she really didn't realize it until she noticed it had stopped. My girlfriend left for work and I was the only one home (everyone else was at work). Around 12pm I decided to get some lunch, so I was at the fridge. They have two dogs and they were sitting behind me on the kitchen floor when I heard what sounded like someone step over the dogs and onto the kitchen floor. The reason that I can pinpoint this sound is because we are constantly stepping over the damn dogs, they are always getting in our way. This noise startled and shocked me and when I turned around nobody was there.

When I was home alone one day, I heard someone moving things around in the house. I wasn't sure where it was coming from. I thought maybe the kitchen, but then I realized it was coming from the attic. The attic they have in their house is just a small crawl-space attic, you really can't get more than 1 person up there. The only way you can get into the attic is from a panel is the room my girlfriend and I share. I was the only one home then and I had stayed in my room all day. Shortly after these noises occurred my girlfriend's mom came home from work and they stopped.

So these are just a few paranormal experiences that I/we have had here.

Before I write down the next one, a little background on the thing in question is needed I think.

An 'aswang' is a general term I think for any monster that roams the land to do evil such as eating or harming children. Usually it can be in the form of an animal that's strangely large, small or has unnatural features (glowing eyes, claws that are too long, stuff like that). Sometimes, it can also be a person that turns into a monster at night and preys on children or people walking on the roadside alone.

Now, to the story.

My grandmother said that there was a very rich couple that owned a mansion in their town. This mansion was in the outskirts of town near a large rice field so it was pretty remote. You usually had to drive through woodlands since there was no road to it. They had another lavish house near the town where they usually stayed. They never had children and never went to the city as rich people usually do eventually.

Every week, towards the weekend, the couple would drive to their remote mansion, and the husband would leave his wife there. Then he would go back on the same day. The next day, the man would drive back to pick up his wife.

You'd think this was because she wanted to have a weekend to herself. But it was common knowledge in the town that the woman was an 'aswang' and the weekend was her time of changing. The people said that she had a room there where she couldn't get out and was left with carcasses of dead or barely alive animals to eat over the weekend while she was in the change. Whenever people saw their car (they were the only ones rich enough to afford one at the time go through the town, they knew why).

I don't know what's happened now to the couple, or to the house but they're probably dead. I guess I'll ask my grandmother and update this post when I find anything out.

UPDATE:

Ok so I asked my other grandma who's a sister to the one who told me this story. Apparently there's another version of the story:

Instead of the husband taking the woman to the remote mansion every weekend, the change happens every night and he doesn't take her there.

She supposedly gets there on her own when the change happens (she flies off) and in the wee hours of the morning you can see the car making its way to the mansion with just the husband. When the car comes back, in the car are the husband and the woman.

It was an accepted fact in the town that she was like this and she rarely left the house. When she was seen, she had lots of makeup on and took great effort in fixing her coiffure.",,False,,t5_2sntx,1351141413.0,,,True,t3_120g5v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/120g5v/fam_leg_a_weekly_routine/,

I don't know if it really was something supernatural or just my mind playing tricks on me, but it really scared me. It's a long story, so bare with me. Also, apologies in advance for any spelling mistakes or weird words/sentences, I'm Dutch.

I still live with my parents and brother. My brother works, so he goes to bed early every day. My parents as well. So I was the only one awake. I was downstairs, on the computer browsing reddit. I think it was about 0:15 when I needed to use the toilet, so I stood up and walked towards it. The toilet is in a small hallway, leading to the front door. It's next to the entrance to the hallway. The lightswitch is on the other side of the toilet, next to the entrance. (Sorry if its a bit vague, I'm Dutch.) When I get to the hallway I hit the lightswitch, but just before the light switches on, I see a white..... shape just in front of me, next to the lightswitch. I only see it for a second before the light goes on. It looked like someone leaning against the wall, facing the toilet. It disturbed me, but I told myself it was just my mind playing tricks on me, so I ignored it. I have had an encounter with a spirit before, but never seen it. I can't see spirits, which also added to my belief it was my mind playing tricks with me. I was still a bit shaken up though, so I quickly went to bed afterwards.

I NEVER dream. I NEVER remember my dreams. But this time, I do remember it and it really scared me. Here's what happened. It was day, and I was just sitting in the living room when I heard the doorbell ringing. I opened the door and there were 2 people there. For the ones who know Supernatural, it were Sam and Dean. I was thrilled; I recognized them of course, and when they asked for a place to stay I happily agreed. They would stay with me in my room (why, I don't know. My room is too small for 3 people and it's not as if my parents would ever agree for me to sleep with 2 boys in my room. But that's why it's a dream) So, when it got dark we went to my room, just talking. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/jnnPT.png) you can see the layout of my room. The circle next to the desk is my light, I always keep it on at night. The light faces the wall 'above' my desk, away from my bed.

Sam quickly claimed my bed, but I didn't really care. Dean is my favourite character in Supernatural, so I kept looking at him, asking him questions, stuff like that. I adored him. Sam was lying in my bed, Dean was sitting at the foot of my bed and I was sitting in the middle. Suddenly, I notice the light turned towards my bed. I freeze, and when Sam asks what's wrong I tell him. He brushes it off, but while I'm still looking at the light it starts moving until it was the way it used to be. I didn't see anything moving it, and neither did Sam and Dean who were watching as well when I asked them. Suddenly, the light started moving like crazy, shining towards my bed and back to the wall, back to my bed, it just kept repeating it really fast. I expected Sam and Dean to act. You know, to get their guns and shoot the thing, but they didn't. They were just sitting there, looking at it. Looked like they weren't hunters in my dream. Wonderful. This went on for a bit, before I just had enough. I got up, and started walking towards the light while screaming at the ghost to fucking leave me alone, to leave my fucking house. Sam warned me not to do that, but I ignored him and continued screaming. I felt myself get dizzy, I had trouble hearing and walking. I stumbled back to the bed and sat down. The feeling didn't dissappear, only intensify. Sam warned me not to do anything, because it was standing right in front of me, with his face a couple of cm from mine. I whimpered, turned around and hugged Sam in fear, crying into his shoulder. Then I felt my body heating up, and I could feel my life leaving my body. I kept feeling weaker and weaker while my body got hotter. Just before I lost conciousness, I woke up. The thing that really freaked me out then, was that my body was hot. Like, really hot. I wasn't sweating or anything, but I had never felt that hot before. I was hot, even though my room was cold because I had my window open all night. I was still felt a little weak, and before I fully realized everything that happened (I was still half asleep), tears were streaming down my face even though I didn't feel like crying. Then I fully woke up, and I jumped out of bed. It wasn't until I left my room, that my body started coolling down.

Any thoughts? I need to know if it was something supernatural or if there is a logical explanation for what happened. It really scared me, and if it is something supernatural I want to know how to stop something like this from happening again.

EDIT: please, don't just downvote and move on. It's fine if you downvote me, I don't care about the karma, I just want some advice. Downvoting me is fine, just explain why. All I'm looking for is some help explaining this to me.

EDIT2: Last night I had the exact same dream again, and the same things happened after I woke up. I also talked about this with a friend who has experience dealing with the supernatural, and the thing that stumped her was the part about my body. I didn't really explain before, as I didn't really think about it at the time. I don't really know how to explain it, so I apologize if it's unclear. As I explained, my body was really hot. But I didn't have that warm feeling. I was actually a little cold, with my window open all night.

(DIS),Limitedvisor,13,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/xg0z5/dreams_of_the_future_dis/,"Well this happened like 3 years ago, my cousin had killed himself, since we lived in different towns. My mom had to leave town to console my aunt. While my mom was there, I asked her if she could bring back one of my cousin's caps, just so I had something to remember him by. When she got back into town, she brought back one of the hats that my cousin usually wears a lot. That same night I got it. A bunch of my friends called me and asked if I wanted to hang out with them. I agreed to all of them. First one to hang out with me was my girlfriend. She and I went for a walk around our town, we barely talked because she didn't know what to say. Then she brought up this dream that her mother's friend had. She said that her mother's friend had a dream about me getting a cap. 

I'm not sure if I believe in psychics, but what do you guys think?
She didn't really describe the hat. She also mentioned that the woman who had that dream said that the dream happened three days before my cousin's suicide. 

Sorry, if I'm not making sense. I'm very tired. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,1343736064.0,,,True,t3_xg0z5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/xg0z5/dreams_of_the_future_dis/,

Our little group consists of six adults, three couples. To make it easier to differentiate us we will be using our initials. There are JA&amp;SA, JW&amp;NN and  BR&amp;JR.  

All of us have had our own separate experiences, so we will post individual accounts at other times.  I suppose we'll start off with an encounter that happened to JA(myself) and JW(sitting next to me at the moment). 

It occurred about 3 years ago now, it was sometime in early November and it was a strangely clear night for here. We were sharing an apartment with NN and his bitchface of a girlfriend at that time. Well she never ceased to piss me and JW off so we spent a good deal of our time outside chain smoking and ranting. 

On the particular evening in question, we were smoking and bitching at our favorite spot (across the street adjacent to our shitty apartment building) minding our own business. With a short break in conversation, I noticed a tapping noise coming from near a“Stop” sign  pole. More curious than anything, I mentioned it to JW and switched spots with her so she could get a better listen. As JW was listening and trying to pinpoint where the noise was coming from, I happened to look down the street.

It's still hard to fully describe what it was I saw. But it looked like three figures coming towards us, but they were moving is such a distorted, unnatural manner that it almost made me sick to my stomach. JW gave up on pinpointing the source of the noise when she saw the confused/disgusted look on my face. So she turned and saw the figures as well. 

Seriously though, even when they were under street lamps they were completely black and had no features or hair.  Their arms were long and swinging...and sometimes seemed boneless. It was then that were about to hit the ol' dusty trail back to our shitty apartment. So we were shagging ass back that direction when for some stupid stupid reason, a fucking streetlamp caught our attention (it was in the opposite direction than the strange figures were coming from) 

We both just stopped and stared at the streetlamp in the distance. We were both compelled to keep going down the road, forgetting about our safe apartment. The light started flickering, generally not an abnormal occurrence but this just seemed like it was beckoning us, as if to say, “Over here”.

So being us, we kept going, not paying any mind to the bad vibes and sinking feelings we had because our curiosity will be the death of us. 

As we were venturing down the road, things started to get stranger than before. We both saw this strange figure scaling the rooftops to our left. It was sort of monkey like in it movements but there are no monkeys in this area....of ANY sort. And it was giggling but a really nervous almost manic type of giggle. I have no freaking idea what the hell it was. JW says the only thing she can think to call it is an imp, but even that doesn't seem to be right.

We brushed it off enough to keep going toward whatever was drawing us to it. And  as we were walking, if we separated even the slightest bit, it was like something was pushing us back together. We took the hint at that point and stayed close together. Walking further on, we saw a dark figure in the distance about two blocks away. We just assumed that it was someone standing outside having a cigarette. No big deal. 

However, the closer we got something was frantically trying to push us back. That should have stopped us but the pull was stronger and almost magnetic at this point. So we kept going. It really sank in when we were about a half a block away from the figure we had seen. He...It was under the streetlamp and he wasn't standing so much as hovering a couple inches off the ground. It looked like a person cast in a shadow or made of one....It had a long flowing coat and fog around where his feet should have been. The feeling it gave off was horrible. It had a very malevolent air about it. It was when we saw the red burning eyes that the magnetic pull broke. At which point, we flipped around, went down a side street and noped the fuck out of there. 

I kid you not, that is the fastest that I or JW have EVER ran. When we finally made it back to the apartment, we gave NN's bitchface girlfriend the stinkeye and then locked ourselves in the room we shared. I got the urge to write in one of my journals. It was more of a collaborative journal between JW and I, in which we wrote down our strange experiences in. So I was writing with JW, who was making sure I didn't miss a detail when something happened. I no longer had control of what I was writing. There was a white hot  presence holding and controlling my hand; writing in my stead. It was terrifying. After I got control of my hand back, which took a lot of fighting(JW and I both tried to pry the fucking pen from my hand it wouldn't budge and just kept on writing away), I noticed how distorted and strange the handwriting was and refused to look at the journal after that. 

JW says that the messages were very rude, threatening and it was directed toward both her and I. The message called her things like “weak”, “blonde haired bitch”, and told us it wanted to make us scream. 

That was the only time we've ever had an account with something that seemed to have such malicious intent. And the only time that I've ever had something control part of my person.  We've long since gotten rid of that journal. The vibe completely changed and it wasn't a comfortable feeling when you went near it.

We are open to any ideas, feel free to let us know. We are open to any theories you might have. 

Sorry it's so long winded, there was just a lot of information to cover. 

TL;DR:Shadow figures to the left of us.  We went to go back to our apartment, streetlamp catches our attention. Strange creatures trying to warn us/stop us from going any further. See something horrifying....Noped the fuck out of there, it followed us home. Forced my hand to write messages..... Any suggestions of what it could be?
