- Finds Robin van Persie, helps him mature into a world class player, stands by him during the rape accusation and countless injuries.  One excellent season and van Persie turns away and leaves for the club and the manager's most hated rival.

- Finds Samir Nasri.  Buys him.  Sticks with him through two rubbish seasons.  He has six great months.  Fucks off to the richest club in the world.

1370020717.0,315,self.Gunners,1fexkm,Regarding the new vote arrows,dialtech,418,103,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1fexkm/regarding_the_new_vote_arrows/,"While I generally like the redesign of this subreddit, I didn't really appreciate replacing the upvote arrow with an Arsenal crest. I certainly love the Arsenal, but I think using the crest as upvote arrow looks clumsy, and the small size doesn't justify the design of it. I also believe the vote buttons should always resemble an arrow, in line with the general reddit desing.

So without anything else to do, waiting for news on the unthinkable Cesc rumours, I came up with some ideas for this small piece of graphic, trying to encapsulate our club into it.

Old, classic designs always fascinates me, so I went straight to the [art deco crest](http://i.imgur.com/XyzSYp4.png) for inspiration.

I used the [A for arrow](http://i.imgur.com/GcQc7Ol.png) and then the [football](http://i.imgur.com/RqXKcLW.png) as, uh, ball, and put them into a mockup.

[Example](http://i.imgur.com/ZQ76oHi.png)

The colors red, blue and gold are taken from the [modern Arsenal crest](http://i.imgur.com/lv03ANQ.png).

What do you guys think? Tell me if you think it's ugly, nice, not worth your time, if it should be adjusted, if we should use this or if we should just forget it, anything.

PS: I have everything in transparent graphics, so it should be easy to implement in the CSS.",,False,self,t5_2qhqt,1370020803.0,,,True,t3_1fexkm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1fexkm/regarding_the_new_vote_arrows/,

The intent is to create &amp; maintain a thread which tracks transfer rumours (w/source links), and ultimately the Gunners' transfer comings &amp; goings, all month long... a one-stop-shop for the Arsenal Jan. '13 transfer window, if you will.

[Jan. 8] Reformatted post - ""Target Rumours"" section was getting hard to read.

[Jan. 14] Thank you, mods, for adding thread to the sidebar.

[Jan. 22] Dropped Olsson, Taraabt, Turan, Zarate, McCarthy, Szalai, Emanuelson, &amp; Biglia from the limited sources section.  The post was exceeding the character limit due to all the links, and none of these players had been tied to Arsenal in some time.

[Jan. 28] Dropped AdriÃ¡n, Aurier, &amp; Cavani

[Jan. 31, transfer window closed] Hope this was a worthwhile project for r/Gunners; I enjoyed it

I sometimes see posts asking about where to watch Arsenal games in my city or it's my first time going to the Emirates which pub should i go too.
 
so I started this [Google Map](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=218285163123318628581.0004d9ebe6f453b6f724e&amp;msa=0) of bar's/pubs/boozers to watch Arsenal Matches or are just Arsenal Friendly in general. 

I got a lot of these places from [Arsenal.com](http://www.arsenal.com/usa/news/features/arsenal-bars), from going to games and internet searches. 

I'd love to get people from all over the world to add to this list and so it help other Gooners who are either on business trips, holidays (Vacation) or just generally new to the club and are looking for a place to go. 

if you could also just give me some general feedback on improvements or just let me know that ""Somebody did this already dipshit! here's a link to it""

This is just in it's infancy so there hasn't been much work gone into this yet. if it's successful enough feedback wise i'm happy add/remove places. it might be a handy link for people to have. 


***Edit: Well that was much more positive than i expected! a huge thanks to everyone for corrections, additions and removals. PM me or drop a message to this post if there any more updates. it's looking a bit bare in the southern hemisphere so id love to get a few places if there are any!***",,False,self,t5_2qhqt,1367406991.0,,,True,t3_1derm5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1derm5/any_interest_in_a_where_can_i_watch_the_arsenal/,

I'm going from Canada. I was wondering if there's any way people can see the players a bit closer before or after the game. Is there a designated time they get off the bus or do you just have to be very lucky?

Aside from that, any other tips for my first game?

Things that I've been hearing, yet to be confirmed (if someone could link sources I'd be thankful).  
OUT
Park-Chu Young to Celta Vigo for around 4 million.  Bendtner to Juventus.  Chamakh and Miquel to Malaga.

IN
Loic Remy (50/50) for about 10-15 million.  Cheik Tiote in.  Michael Essien in on season long loan with option to buy.  Dzeko's name thrown around but I doubt we buy him.  Apparently we've made an Enquiry about Sturridge (Doubt we can get him).  Possibly Yohan Cabaye, [this](https://twitter.com/AFC_Followers/status/240782005632114689/photo/1) was posted yesterday (screenshot of Arsenal club shop with Cabaye's name on it)

If something is confirmed, please put CONFIRMED in caps/bold.

**CONFIRMED** Daniel Boateng loaned out to Oxford United until January.  [Source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19404482)

EDIT:  We may make a bid for Sturridge, I still highly doubt it

EDIT:  10-15 million for Remy (MAYBE)

EDIT:  Now possibly less likely that we get Essien on loan.  Chelsea turned down a loan bid from Everton for him

EDIT:  Squillaci's contract may be bought out.

EDIT:  Ignasi Miquel could go to Malaga on LOAN, not full deal

EDIT:  Clint Dempsey situation being monitored by Arsenal, however as of now he is most likely to end up at Liverpool or Sunderland.  **UPDATE**  A bid was accepted for Dempsey from Aston Villa, however they will [drop](https://twitter.com/SkySports) out of the race as Dempsey still wants to end up at Liverpool

EDIT:  Fernando Llorente could be a possible target.  It would cost anywhere from 20-25 million to get him.  Odds on him joining Arsenal went from 7/1 to 7/2 yesterday.

EDIT:  Arsenal could make a bid for Yanga-Mbiwa which would be from around 6-10 million.  Doesn't seem likely after the champions league draw.

EDIT:  Gregory Van Der Wiel could be signed tomorrow.  Plenty of rumors linking him to us, a lot coming from the dutch press saying Arsenal are monitoring the situation.  **UPDATE**  Van der Wiel will be signed by PSG for around 4.5 million.  [Source](http://www.thesportscampus.com/2012083124293/transfer-news/paris-st-germain-set-to-seal-p45-million-van-der-wiel-capture). 

EDIT:  This sucks.  Please sign someone.

EDIT:  I give up.  Hopefully we can get our first win Sunday, got a gut feeling we're going to come together.",,False,self,t5_2qhqt,1346441841.0,,,True,t3_z3jf0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/z3jf0/arsenal_transfer_deadline_rumorconfirmation_thread/,

As all of their fans were yelling at the top of their lungs for their favorite players my eyes glanced over to see a neglected Sahin sitting at the end of the golf cart that would take him back to the tour bus. As an Arsenal fan I instinctively yelled at the top of my lungs, ""HEY SAHIN, COME TO ARSENAL!"" Without saying a word he looked me straight into my eyes and gave me the most beautiful and convincing wink I have ever laid my eyes upon. So gooners, basically coming from a nobody... this being just about as useless as one of the many rumored tweets surrounding our club, I am convinced we've got Sahin in the bag.

The things I'm seeing around Santos are getting very annoying. We claim we want players to be loyal to the club, and complain when players leave. Yet a couple bad games from Santos and people are demanding we sell him and are talking complete shit about him? 

If we want players to be loyal to the club, the fans need to set an example of fans being loyal to the players. No, Santos hasn't been playing well and I'm not arguing he doesn't deserve poor reviews. It's another to step it up to the level that many individuals here, and more genuinely Arsenal fans collectively have. What does this show? It shows the second you have a couple of bad games, we'll throw you to the wolves.

edit: To clarify, I'm not arguing Santo's performance. All the other players people have listed showed a lot of potential and struggled, and I think it's fairly agreeable that Santos is never going to be a great LB for Arsenal.

1375913072.0,143,self.Gunners,1jwwuy,Liverpool fan here. May I suggest a bet involving the Luis Suarez fiasco? (for charity),Mozza215,187,44,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1jwwuy/liverpool_fan_here_may_i_suggest_a_bet_involving/,"I was thinking today about how annoyed I'd be if we (Liverpool) sold him to you guys, because it would obviously dramatically decrease our chances of getting 4th this year. I honestly believe, with all of my brain and heart, that there isn't a chance in hell that Suarez will make the switch from ~~Arsenal to Liverpool~~ (oops, getting ahead of myself there) Liverpool to Arsenal. I'm so confident with that belief that I'm willing to propose a small (and it is small) bet/deal.

If Liverpool do sell Suarez to you, I'll donate Â£25 to a charity of your guys' choice. **I'll donate to the charity that gets the most support on this thread (so upvote for visibility!) if/when the transfer is confirmed.** Serious suggestions only of course, **I will not donate to a PayPal account, only registered charities.** It could be a charity that works with the club, or a charity that you have a personal connection to. Whatever you favour most, I'll donate Â£25 to if the transfer goes through.

I know Â£25 isn't a large amount of money, but it's better than nothing, and there seems to be a bit of tension between our sets of fans. I'm hoping a small bet for a good cause will alleviate some of that tension.

If Suarez stays at Liverpool or moves anywhere but Arsenal (and I'm putting my faith in the former), then the deal is void. If you lot do lose, then I haven't a clue what I'll ask of you because my brain is embarrassingly uncreative :/ maybe decide something amongst yourselves in this thread?

If you don't fancy making a deal with a Liverpool fan that's fair enough, but I just thought I'd put the idea out there. None of us will gain anything (I won't even gain karma), and money will be sent to a worthwhile cause.

And keep up the awesome support for your club, this is a cracking subreddit.

Arsenal fans, over here and on /r/soccer, have been putting down the subreddit and I feel like we as a community can do something to better our little piece of reddit.

This is not an attack against dissenters, though I tend to disagree with you guys for the most part, I 'd like for all of us to work together in making this one of the best places to come to for Arsenal news and discussion.

So what are your thoughts? your issues? your compliments?

Also keep it as civil as possible even if you disagree.

**Points raised so far:**

Issues:

* Memes, happy birthday posts, and ""look what I got in the mail"" posts

* Layout of the subreddit

* Your new kit isn't post material. Seriously, no one cares.

* Proper sources for transfer rumours. There will be some issue here as crap sources sometimes do have quality. See Gary Neville writing for the Daily Mail as an example.

The good:

* Pre-match analysis like the one trending right now

* Good videos that have not been posted a billion times/ havent been posted in a while

* Biased Match Threads

* Tottenham bashing in moderation

* Great articles.  see u/charzan usually good stuff

* Tactics


Also upvote for visibility, I get no Karma out of this.


Edit: This has been up long enough for me to gather that we are very different and I see why implementing anything here is a bit of an issue. That being said there seems to be a couple of issues that we, for the most part, can agree on. 

* Fifa 13 posts are not relevant. This goes without saying, No one gives a damn if you beat Bayern 10 nil before a game.

* Pictures of your kids and pets. Adorable but outside of going ""aaw"" there is nothing more to say and this stuff belongs with your friends and family. 

* Your new kit. This is my big one. Really, no one cares....... even a little bit.

I can't for the life of me understand why the club is pushing so hard for Suarez and dismissing Higuain. It seems unlikely that Liverpool would sell Suarez to us for less than 50-55m.  Liverpool does not want to sell him to another PL club and especially one above them in the table if they have Champions League aspirations. It seems the only way it could be made to work is if Suarez makes a mess of it and asks for a transfer. He seems reluctant to do so. I understand that he is absolutely a top class goal scorer, but let us not be blinded by our trophy ambitions to his horrible temperament. One only needs to watch a few videos on YouTube to be reminded that he is a racist, a stomper, a diver, and a biter.
On the other hand, Higuain is available, interested, and cheaper. I understand that he is not the goal scorer that Suarez is, but make no mistake, he is a top class finisher. Last season, we had a very balanced scoring squad. Our striker doesn't need to carry the load, so to speak. We need a striker that can show that he can regularly bury the ball in front of the net. I like Giroud, but how many times did he miss horribly from in front of the net? If we spend the whole summer chasing a ghost and let our second and third options sign away to other clubs, we will regret letting Higuain get away when he clearly wanted to be here.
I would rather we slightly overpay for Higuain (32m) than drastically overpay Suarez (55m). If we sign Higuain now, we are assured a top class scorer for the next season. With the money saved from that deal, we can sign a CB to bolster our defense and sign a top tier GK. I think we'd all be quite pleased if we went into next season with the additions of Higuain, Bernard, Williams, and Cesar.

edit: I had originally put Higuain's cost at 37m. That reported number was in euros. I changed it to the GBP price for accuracy. My apologies.",,False,self,t5_2qhqt,1374612572.0,,,True,t3_1iwgr6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1iwgr6/anyone_else_want_higuain_over_suarez/,

I wasn't really a fan of the design in /r/GunnersTest alhough it did have some elements that I liked. But it was missing the gooner alien, a topical image in the style of /r/soccer and overall the design was not complete.

I hope you like the changes I've made here. I'm not really a designer so this does not come naturally to me. I am open to suggestions on ways to improve the design as I still consider that there is too much blue left over from the default style.

Some of the graphics could do with improving. The banner background at the top is not great but I did my best and the red Gunners logo in the top right is still a bit weak.

If you want to help improve the design then by all means improve the banner background and other graphics here. If you don't like the design at all then don't be afraid to say so. I will happily revert it or use the design from /r/GunnersTest instead.

**Feedback is very welcome so speak your mind.**

**EDIT:** Just for clarity. People seem to me using the word ""banner"" to describe two different images. Can we agree to call them: ""banner background"" and ""topical image"" for the sake of this discussion? The ""topical image"" is the one in the top left and and the ""banner background"" is the full width image behind it.

Under that same principle, I think we should give him a lot of credit for last night, especially since he made a few big decisions. He started Fabianksi, someone who hasn't played any first team games since, what, 2011? Everyone doubted him on that. The other **big** decision he made were the substitutions of the Ox and Gervinho for Walcott and Ramsey. Both worked out pretty well, especially since we started the second half particularly poorly and after they came in we gained a bit more control.

&gt; Morning all. As many of you will be aware, Robin van Persie will meet Arsene &amp; Gazidis at 1030am this morning at AW's house.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm privileged to bring you live coverage of that meeting: the conversation, the croissants,&amp; the contract. Follow at #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Ivan is already here, waiting for AW to return. He's just popped to Tesco after late panic that RVP might request Earl Grey. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Arsene arrives; apologises for being late. Apparently he was driving with the handbreak on. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Ivan &amp; Arsene currently discussing which of Ivan's perplexing myriad of accents would be most suited to the meeting. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; They've plumped for transatlantic drawl. He can always slip in to South African if things take a bad turn. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Arsene &amp; Ivan anxiously await RVP. AW idly fondles a pain aux raisin; Gazidis plays Angry Birds. The atmosphere is electric. #arsenallive
&gt; 
&gt; Annie Wenger brings in a jug of orange juice. Arsene tests it &amp; is furious when he discovers it has bits in. Robin hates bits. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Annie Wenger is crying next door. Ivan Gazidis is hurriedly trying to remove all the bits with a tea-strainer. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Ivan asks Arsene if he could briefly explain the offside rule before Robin arrives. Arsene says it is not a good time. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Robin is 5mins late. AW is grey with worry. His phone rings, &amp; he looks at it excitedly. It is Park calling. He doesn't answer. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Doorbell: Robin arrives. Darren Dein is with him. Ivan deploys South African mode. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Quartet make small-talk. Conversation turns to old friends: Thierry, Cesc, Gael, Samir. A pattern emerges. AW gulps. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; On Nasri, Ivan jumps in: ""Remember when we he got Frimponged? That was DENCH"", and goes for the fist-bump with AW. Silence. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Arsene diligently pours himself a bowl of Bran Flakes - he is worried there will not be any significant movement this summer. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Robin takes a croissant. Arsene offers him red jam, but Darren convinces him the blue one is better. AW gulps again. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Arsene is struggling to cut the fruit loaf. He mumbles something about his knife ""lacking a little bit sharpness."" #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Talk turns to this season. AW congratulates RVP on his individual awards. Robin says he'd swap them all for a trophy. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Ivan reaches under the table &amp; produces a '3rd place' trophy. He made it at home, from an egg-cup &amp; silver foil. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Robin takes it; hands it to DD, who places it on the floor. Ivan is crestfallen. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; There is a lull in conversation. Ivan tries to lift spirits by pondering which way up the chocolate digestives should go. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; IG:""You'd assume chocolate on top, but then the writing is on the bottom. Whereas on a non-chocolate one,the writing's on top.""#ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Seeking to move things along, Darren asks about Arsenal's plans for the summer. Ivan says he's going to Mauritius. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Arsene is on his second bowl of Bran Flakes. Vitamin B12: For mental strength. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; RVP enquires about proposed M'Vila deal. AW explains it broke down over failure to acquire enough apostrophes for club shop. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; RVP asks about new coaches. AW explains he's hired someone indelibly linked with the fabric of the club. An Arsenal legend... #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; ...He motions to the door. Kaba Diawara walks in. Robin tries to leave. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Robin calms down as AW explains that Diawara's role will not extend beyond Pat Rice's cone duties. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; AW smiles knowingly. He thinks he has the clincher... #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; AW invites RVP to the patio, where Theo, Vermaelen, Szczesny, &amp; Ramsey perform an acappella version of East 17's 'Stay Now'. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; On the line, ""I touch your face while you are sleeping"", Theo sheds a solitary tear. AW smiles. RVP is uncomfortable. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; RVP applauds politely; asks why Ramsey didn't know words. AW says he planned to use Diaby but he failed a late fitness test #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; They return to the house. Arsene suggests the quartet showed great mental strength to perform in the Hertfordshire chill. #Arsenallive
&gt; 
&gt; RVP says he needs time to think. He &amp; DD need to talk to a man about a dog. The dog is in Manchester, or something. They leave. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; After a long silence, Arsene Wenger gets up, shakes Ivan's hand, and leaves. Then remembers this is his house, and comes back. #ArsenalLive
&gt; 
&gt; Ivan departs. Meeting adjourned. TO BE CONTINUED. Thanks for following #arsenallive.

Wenger has not just lost Cesc and Nasri, but Wilshire too. 

Liverpool have a net transfer spend of 38.6 mil in 2011/12 season
Chelsea have a net transfer spend of 62.7 mil in 2011/12 season
Arsenal have a net transfer profit 14.7 mil in 2011/12 season

Just over a year ago our biggest transfer âneedâ was to buy a goalkeeper. 

Many feared we might not even get past Udinese to make the group stage of the CL this year, let alone top our group. 

The current season is far from over, however there are reasons for controlled optimism. 

We have money to spend (50mil in the bank) and  the board might finally be ready to spend money on players, AND pay them a competitive wage (letâs not forget Mata had all but agreed to play for us until he got better personal terms from Chelsea). 

RVP will likely stay as theyâll break the bank to keep him.

Wilshire will return.

The OX is improving and will play a much bigger role next season.

Weâve spent less than Chelsea &amp; Liverpool - who are both below us. 

Weâve lost key players - yet our league performance could easily see us improve on our final position last year.

This isnât reactionary in light of a few good results, itâs a measured view on where we are now and where we could be next season. 

Iâd rather be a Gooner than a Chelsea or Liverpool fan. 

The media keeps talking about Arsenal and itâs many problems, but things arenât all that bad. 

As Gooners we really can be optimistic about the future.

In Wenger we trust.",,False,self,t5_2qhqt,False,,,True,t3_qha4n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/qha4n/perspective/,

Yesterday I code [this quick web app](http://gunnerstv.herokuapp.com/) to let anyone check if the Gunners are playing today and if so on which UK or US Channels ( other countries are coming soon ) are broadcasting the game.

There's also a list of free live Streams to watch the Gunners. ( I get the data from atdhe.eu ) 

If they are not playing, you will get the date and details for the upcoming fixture.

It was a fun app to code and it took me ~10H. 

You can check it out @ http://gunnerstv.herokuapp.com/

If you have any feedback, please shoot away :)

Man the f*ck up.,i_suck_teddy_thumbs,204,84,152,http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/ybdeb/seriously_guys_man_the_fck_up/,"Edit 2: This post is a post speaking in absolutes that I may not even be entirely convinced of. My point is, we should still all love Arsenal. We'll get by without RVP, and I genuinely believe the club is moving forward with our latest signings and we'll be able to challenge for honours. It's an extreme positive outlook to combat the endless negativity on this thread. It got peoples attention. And I've personally been replying to everyone expressing negative views, to discuss reasons why they think everything is going to shit, and why I think things are actually looking up a little bit. If you think I'm an idiot fine, but when you tell me, tell me why you think arsenal is going to shit.

So many people are being ridiculously negative on this subreddit.

We have a kick ass squad. Those saying we need to spend the money to replace RVP, we already have by buying two quality strikers. 

Those saying Podolski doesn't make it at big clubs? Bayern Munich is one club. Different league, different style of play, different culture, different team, different fans. He's also a different person now. More mature, probably knows what he wants from life. Even when he plays poorly he scores. He's versatile, he's a goal scorer, he's a winner. 

Giroud was top scorer in the french league for Montpellier. He pretty much won the league for them over PSG. The Man City of France. He has the belief to win against the odds. He has the ability to score goals, and not just headers. Watch the youtube vids of him he has scored some wonder goals. Also he's had an almost identical career path to Bosscielny.

We've also bought Cazorla. The best midfielder in La Liga behind Xavi and Iniesta according to many footballers and bloggers and podcasters. He was Spanish player of the year in 2009. He's won all the major trophies one can win with Spain. He's a winner. I mean, C'mon!

We also have Wilshere coming back, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Two of England's brightest young stars. Anyone who says Wilshere won't be the same. Of course not, but he'll get there. He was out for a year? So what he just needs to get fit again. Remember, Class Is Permanent.

So we're gonna get rid of Song? Who cares! If he wants to leave, let him. Dein is his agent and fuck him. We might get Sahin in, and he's brilliant. Seriously fucking good. An unbelievable tackler, and he possesses fantastic technique.

Wenger has been quoted as saying he is still looking in the market. He has 24million to burn. (on the Arsenal player)

We have the best Welsh player and captain.

We have the best Czech player and captain.

We have the best Russian player and captain.

We have one of, if not the best right back in the world.

We have one of the most underrated spanish midfielders in the world. Someone who brings calm to a storm and has lego hair.

We have the fastest footballer in the world.

We have the most skilful african in the world.

We have a cuddly maverick.

We have one of the most cocky goalkeepers in the world.

We have a Centre back who told Barca to fuck off.

We have the Verminator.

Now grow some balls guys and trust in Arsenal!

Edit: Guys, people who think I'm deluded, or i'm ""trying to be like wenger"" aren't getting what I'm trying to achieve here. I'm trying to point out that the one thing a fan of a team can't do is stop backing their own fucking team to perform. It's the fan's job to get behind the team. Back them, and believe in them no matter what.

Here's why: 

* **Interest in him isn't anywhere near as high as he thought.** Only Juventus, Man City and Man Utd have expressed interest, however Arsenal are very reluctant to agree to an offer from either of the Manchester clubs, which leaves him with Juventus or bust. Not the wealth of options he would have expected to have had after his last season.

* **He's not going to get a long-term contract.** No-one in their right mind is going to offer van Persie a long-term contract considering his age and injury record. Any club that does could be saddled with an old, injured flop.

* **He's a bit of a system babby.** He is an excellent technical player, but physically he's pretty mundane - not particularly fast, tall or strong. This means that he is reliant on getting quality supply to his feet so that he can use his technical ability as much as possible. Where can he get the best supply of ball into feet? Arsenal or Barcelona. If he struggles to get high-quality supply then he is prone to becoming very anonymous, very fast (look at his form for the Netherlands in recent years). 

* **He has lost the respect of the Arsenal fans.** By making a public statement deriding the club's direction, serving as a veiled insult to Wenger, Gazidis and Hill-Wood he banked on the Arsenal fans growing angry at the board and understanding van Persie's reasons for leaving. Big mistake. In attacking the club he has only served to alienated the people that supported and liked him most, his presence at the club is now resented and he has been rightly stripped of the captaincy. 

* **Arsenal have called his bluff.** Arsenal with the signings of Podolski and Giroud had worked fast to replace van Persie - I think  we all knew that realistically you can't have a starting French, German and Dutch striker competing for one spot, that is just too much quality for any club to have in one position. We've now shown real intent by going after Santi Cazorla and Nuri Sahin, and if we can snap up one of those then we are going to be a much better team than we ever were with Robin van Persie in it.

It was a good post, but when I got to his 6th and final point I felt he went off course a bit. Now that I have the time I decided it would be a fun exercise and hopefully a learning experience for some non-American Gooners to understand a bit better Kroenkeâs other franchises/teams

The point made that I had a problem with was this:

&gt;6) Finally, all of Kroenke's sport franchises are self-sustaining but mediocre. When he takes over a team or creates a new franchise, it does not win championships but remains in mid-table mediocrity without any financial problems. Arsenal has moved to a completely self-sustaining model completely bolstered by the purchase of Emirates Stadium, making it the perfect investment for a collector of sports teams with no ambition.

This paragraph does a disservice to Gooners who donât know how American sports, specifically the NBA and NFL. I hope that over the next few (term used lightly) words to give you all a better understanding of how Kroenkeâs history of owning/running teams in these league can not be used to make the claim that he is all of self-sustained âmid-tableâ mediocrity.

It is important to point out at the beginning that Kroenke is no longer in direct control of this team. He was forced to give control to his son when he became sole owner of the St Louis Rams of the NFL in 2010.

Kroenke became the full-owner of the Nuggets in 2000.

in 1995 Kroenke bought a 40% stake in the Rams when they moved from Los Angeles to St. Louis. He then became full owner in 2010

**1) The Nuggets and Rams are a small-market teams, meaning that they are not located in one of the major cities (the Londons, Manchesters, Liverpools, Madrids, Paris, etc of Europe) of the US.**

This is a major constraint in all sports in all countries. The best players want to play in the biggest cities where they can maximize their exposure and their own brand.

**2) The teams he had just bought were not anywhere near the quality of Arsenal**

In the 3 years prior to his taking over the Nuggets they finished in last place, 4th to last place, an 10th to last place. They also had no history of being great, having never even been to a NBA final (the NBA like all major American professional sports uses a playoff system to determine the champion).

The Rams had not made it to the NFL playoffs for 5 straight years prior to Kroenke buying in and their records during those years were; 5-11, 3-13, 6-10, 5-11, and 4-12. Now The Ramâs like the Nuggets didnât have a great history of winning, though they had won 2 NFL championships those came in 1945 and 1951. The NFL has been dominated by a handful of teams in its history: the NY Giants, Dallas Cowboys, San Francisco 49ers, Pittsburg Steelers, New England Patriots AND the GREEN BAY PACKERS*.

**3) In the years since Kroenke took over the teams have seen âGolden Erasâ**

The Nuggets have placed first or second in itâs division each year starting with 04/05. During this time the NBA title has been won by 6 teams: Los Angeles Lakers (5x), San Antonio Spurs (2x), Miami Heat (2x), and one each for the Detroit Pistons, Boston Celtics, and Dallas Mavericks. The Lakers, Celtics, Heat, and Mavericks, when they won their titles, were populated by players who will go down as some of the best to ever play the games. These are your Kobe Bryantâs, Lebron Jamesâ, Shaqâs, Tim Duncanâs, etc etc. These were and are the best of the best in the NBA a league in which having 1 or 2 true superstars can is everything. 

The Ramâs from 1995-2005 were consistently one of the best teams in the NFL. Their offense was so good it was nicknamed the âGreatest Show on Turfâ. They reached the Super Bowl twice and won 1 (1998). The team saw a drastic dropoff in quality after these years as their star players aged/retired/left. This loss of talent coupled with the rise of 4 of the greatest QBs in NFL history created a climate in which it was difficult for the Rams to get back to their winning ways. Their prospects in the near future are good though. The team has a good young QB and has been making BIG moves (and yes I mean BIG) this offseason to surround with with the talent required to win. 

**4) The salary cap, the salary cap, the salary cap!!!!**

The main thing that makes in impossible to compare how Kroenke runs his teams and what he can do with Arsenal is the salary cap.

Basically in the NBA and NFL there is a set limit a team came spend each year on its players. In the PL Cityâs wage bill was 202 million pounds, the lowest wage bill was only 35 million. Cityâs wage bill was nearly 6 times as high as the lowest team. In the NFL the lowest and highest spenders were within 27 millions dollars of each other. Itâs a bit wider in the NBA where the difference was be about 50 million (the highest spends around 100 and lowest around 50)

What these constraints on spending means is that a team cannot just come in and throw bags upon bags of money at players (like two teams Iâm sure you can think of). Teams are required to build from within through the drafting of young players which puts more emphasis on scouting, development, and finding diamonds in the rough. Also very important to note is that there are salary cap ""floors"" so teams in the NBA and NFL have to spend a minimum amount on salaries each year.**

Also, in the NFL there is not a first 11, but rather there is a first 22 and generally 45+ players take part in the game for each team. You simply cannot buy up all the best players there is no room within the salary cap.


**5) Player contracts**

This goes along with the salary cap, but I figured Iâd thrown it in itâs own section. In the NBA teams cannot just pay players whatever they would like. In the NBA there are âmax dealsâ which sets a limit on how much 1 player can make. On top of that the NBAâs rules are set up where teams a player is on can offer them more money then other teams can. For instance Arsenal could offer a player they have brought up through youth 100k a week and another team would only be able to offer 80k. 

**6) The Draft**

This comes in right behind the salary cap as reasons why you canât compare Kroenkeâs other teams with Arsenal. In American sports players are not brought up from young ages under youth contracts. Players play on college teams and after playing 1,2,3, or the full 4 years in college they enter the draft. Each team gets one pick per round ( you can trade picks for other picks or players) and the order each team picks is based on their record the previous year. Basically, the bad teams get to pick up the best players.  Also, you have to remember that for the most part the players picked in the first round are ready to be be starters or even superstars their first year. Itâs not like they get drafter and wonât contribute for 4-5 years. Imagine instead of QPR getting relegated they stay in the premier league and get to pick the highest rated player in the world aged between 19-22.

**Conclusion**

The fact that the Nuggets have been able to build and sustain a winning team while having itâs best players leave in free agency or demand to be traded is a great testament to the organization. Looking forward the team has a good young core and if they can continue to make smart moves in free agency and the draft they will have a chance to win in the years ahead as the NBAâs new salary cap and taxing rules come into full force and prevent the large market teams form having 2,3,4 superstar players stockpiled.

The Rams have peaked, valleyed, and are now looking to be on the rise again. The team is making the right moves in recent years and has been aggressive in going out and trying to get the best pieces it can to build a winning team for years to come.

End the end both teams are run well and canât give us much of any insight into how Kroenke plans to run Arsenal in the future.

Any questions, complaints, or w.e. is welcome!

We would more than triple our previous record transfer and would match the british transfer record that chelsea set when buying torres a few years ago. So why would Arsenal,  a club that has to generate all of its revenue organically agree to a deal of this magnitude?

There are a few reasons:

1. To inspire confidence in our current players, especially our young core. We are letting them know that while they are maturing as players, we will mature as a club and grow with them so that everyones ambitions can be satisfied.

2. We are sending a message to other big players on the market and budding syats around the world that we are a player again. We will never be a psg, city, or chelsea where money is frivously thrown to the wind, but instead will follows barca amd bayerns path. We show loyalty to our own and will buy the best to supplement ourbsquad and stay competitive. They will know we are serious about them arriving and joining a club where they will be very well taken care of and have the talent around them to be competitive each and every season.

3. Sending a message to other clubs, the media and our own supporters. For the last eight or so years Arsenal has been degraded by the media, other coaches and even our fans as a bride's maid who will happily be second best. It's time for other clubs to fear us on the pitch and in the transfer market. For the media to respect the club's results on the pitch rather than it's ethos off of it. We need to restore hope in our supporters and repay their faith with ambitious gestures.

I'm not advocating spending of this magnitude every summer, but the time has come for the club to turn a page and move on to the next stage of our long-term plan. I think the base the club has established of frugality,  faith in youth,  respect for its players etc. Is wonderful, which is why I'm so excited about what a move like this could bring.

I'm not going to go into Suarez's ln the fields qualities bc we all know how good he is and how perfectly he would compliment our playing style. 
What do you think? 

Tl; dr- Even if we disregard Suarez's on the field value, the message this purchase would send would more than justify his price tag. ",,False,self,t5_2qhqt,False,,,True,t3_1jfone,http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1jfone/why_paying_50_million_pounds_wouldnt_be_as_bad_as/,

Over the last 14 matches, Tottenham accrued 30 points. This was their greatest return over their last 14 matches in 24 seasons. In fact, since the '3 points for a win' precedent was established, this is the only the third time in Tottenham's history that they've accrued 30 points from their last 14 matches.

Arsenal, meanwhile, managed 35 points from their final 14 matches, turning Tottenham's 4 point lead into a 1 point deficit. 35 points was by a fair margin the best return over the last 14 matches in the PL this season (United and Spurs both got 30 from the same stretch, while Chelsea got 29).

Arsenal's 35 from 14 is the best finish by ANY club in the PL over the last 4 years, and is the best finish by Arsenal over the past 11 seasons. Since 1981/82, on only 13 occasions has a club finished the season with 35 points or more over their last 14 matches--Liverpool has done it 6 times, United has done it 4 times, Arsenal has done it twice and Chelsea has done it once.

It may not be anything flashy, but its something we can settle on.

I can edit it in any way the community decides. Graphic Designer at your disposal :)

Also: I know the fonts are wrong, I can of course fix this later, should still give a modest overlook. 

Update: Something like this was requested: http://i.imgur.com/UKeME4A.jpg

Update: New upvote idea: http://imgur.com/Bk06ihq

Edit: I understand the design has changed a lot, and that's the reason I made this. Unless we settle on something it will just continuously change with peoples 'flavour of the month'. With this design we can all agree on it as it matches the official website, and we cant really argue with the design of that website.

1355338861.0,100,self.Gunners,14qlm4,"Tired of the unjustified hate and blame towards individual players, especially Ramsey, Chamakh, and partly Arshavin. It is beginning to make me think this subreddit has forgotten how to analyze a player properly. Here is my Chamakh assessment.",rblakew21,132,32,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/14qlm4/tired_of_the_unjustified_hate_and_blame_towards/,"First I would like to say that I am not going to say who wrote this or which post this is from, but I am going to show you the post about Chamakh that has started this post from me:

""He isn't playing because he is damaged goods and we can't ship him out. He is pathetic in almost every department.
We have enough trouble on our plate, can't waste time on lost causes like him.""

First I cannot begin to see why Chamakh hasn't been given a slight bit more chances. His stats for the season (not including preseason) are 4 appearances total, he has only had 2 starts, one against Reading where he put in a a sublime 2 goal 1 assist effort in which he played very well working hard to gain us possession up high and retain it when needing (It appeared as though he had been watching how Giroud plays). The other was the gifted chance for a few of the reserves to experience a champions league game in Olympiakos, it wasn't his best outing we have ever experienced, but he worked hard and drew 3 fouls upfront, and even put a shot on frame on the only chance he saw lay for him properly, which is apparently hard for even our starters. the other two games were carling cup substitution, one at the 59th and the other at the 71st... in the Hour he played against Bradford he managed 3 shots 1 on target and drew one foul, even managing to not pick up a yellow or commit a foul himself. During the Bradford game he managed to hold up play and look for space, unfortunately he couldn't supply the crosses to himself also.

Here is his only game I can find recapped online from 2012/13 so far:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtTJnHhX8g

as you can see, every ball coming his direction against a Premier League side he was first to, usually with an accurate one touch pass, occasionally he took the riskier pass, usually unsuccessful, but it kept their defense honest. He moved the ball and there is nothing that can be faulted during this game.

2011/12 Was a statistically awkward season for him in total he appears lackluster, but it was his play that isn't represented, he appeared 19 times in total, only managing 1 goal and 1 assist, on separate occasions. But in reality he only started 7, never once consecutive despite performance, substituting on 12 times, of those substitutions he only made it on the field before the 75th minute 3 times (one being the 74th minute).  Both of his goal and assist were in vain as to they were the dismal 4-3 loss to Blackburn as a 75th minute sub scorer, and the dismal second loss to Olympiakos 3-1 in which he started and earned an assist.  During his 7 starts he managed 12 shots, shy of 2 per game, but what offsets that is he has managed to draw 10 fouls during that, in the assumption (i couldn't find foul maps this far back) they are in the attacking third, through him alone he was creating an average of over 3 chances per game. I would assume because of his ability to playmake (i couldn't find stats for his chances created through passes) as forward you could add 1-2 more chances a game on passes. His substitution appearances accumulated to 7 shots and 8 fouls, once again proving his hard work up front.

Here is a video of his 2011/2012 season a few shots from preseason goals in it I think... it shows the good and bad sides of him, but it does show that he is able to create for the team in the position he is in, give more than 15 minutes game, he could have had a 10 goal season (and yes that is my OPINION I do UNDERSTAND the last statement is MY OPINION, thank you).

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i48TMcj00Aw

For his first season I'm going to be brief because it speaks for itself, 29 starts, 19 subs. Had a good tally at 13 goals and 5 assists, but those don't speak numbers of his actual performance. Only 6 starts from the January 1st on, in which he only managed 1 goal and 2 assists. In the first 23 starts he managed 12 goals and 3 assists. He also drew in 52 fouls that season.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj9WDEvDkWQ

Throughout his career at arsenal you can see through video he has a good knack for one touch passing, hold up play, and creating a final chance, he his constantly moving and looking to receive the ball, he has the will we constantly says our players lack, and this is by no means a support for Chamakh to be starting,I just wanted people to realize some of these palyers they want to hate aren't as bad as they seem in these posts I Keep reading. I only played the numbers game because there are so few video's of Chamakh out.

If you enjoyed this article, and wish I will continue with Ramsey who will be my favorite to write and Arshavin who will be an interesting argument, but both are much easier to get stats and video proof for.

He was rarely injured, seemed to love the squad and genuinely wanted to succeed here.  

Throwing him on in the last 20-30 minutes of the game to run those janky runs of his at tired defenders was hugely influential at times. Lest we forget, he was our leading scorer at the beginning of the season last year. 

In addition to letting Arshavin go, we have now lost two left-sided attackers, leaving Podolski and two players (Ox and Gnabry) that are both under 20 years old to cover that side of the field.  Are we comfortable with this?

Arsenalâs 4-1 win at home on Tuesday relegated Wigan - but much more importantly, put our 2013-14 Champions League destiny in our own hands. A win is all we need to take 4th place.

**Formations**

[Possible starting line-ups](http://imgur.com/kojRlhM)

NEWCASTLE: [Previous starting XI v QPR (A, 12th May)](http://imgur.com/1jO6h0x)

Newcastle will be forced to play 3rd choice GK Steve Harper tomorrow, since Krul and Elliot are injured and suspended respectively. Natural LB Davide Santon is back from injury, but the other LB Haidara is still out - Iâm not sure whether Santon will start ahead of the CB Yanga-Mbiwa, who has been filling in at LB for the past couple of games. Although Tiote was injured against QPR, he has been passed as fit to start tomorrow, so Perch will be on the bench again.

ARSENAL: [Previous starting XI v Wigan (H, 14th May)](http://imgur.com/d0ZZi37)

Giroud is back, and Wenger seems keen to play him, which is probably a good thing. Arteta is a major doubt, and itâs unlikely that Wenger will risk him - it could be that he plays for a maximum of 45 minutes. Wenger said that Wilshere is a possibility for CDM, but I think weâre more likely to play Ramsey at CDM to keep the core of the team intact. Iâve lined up the team on the assumption that weâll make the number of changes possible, and just rotate some of the players around our formation.

**Tactics**

NEWCASTLE:

 - General build-up

Cisse made most of his passes [down the left and right wings](http://imgur.com/TFAuxD3) on Sunday - very few through the middle. He often came deep and wide to link up with the 3 attacking creative players behind him. Gouffran, naturally a ST, [played deeper than that on Sunday and will probably start at CAM against us](http://imgur.com/NRvyanm) - he did well there on Sunday, linking up the attacking play and then making forward runs to get into the box. Strangely, when Gouffran started in a more advanced position or drifted out to either wing, Newcastle looked a bit unbalanced and seemed to struggle to work the ball forward.

Ben Arfa can play all across the AM line, but he looked particularly good at RAM, dribbling at defenders, and sometimes cutting inside onto his favoured left foot. We use our LB to keep us wide on the left stretching the opposition defence - whoever we decide to play there tomorrow will need to be sure they retreat quickly if we lose the ball, or weâll be exposed to Ben Arfaâs runs in that empty space.

Both of Newcastleâs FBs will try to get forward a bit - though theyâre not quite as attacking as ours, there is definitely space to be found behind them. QPRâs goal came from a penalty that Debuchy conceded after the space behind him was exposed when he pushed up too far.

 - Set pieces

Ben Arfa is potentially a threat from free kicks around our box. Weâll need to more careful than we were in this area on Tuesday - although we Maloneyâs converted free kick didnât cost us much, things could have been a bit easier had we not given the free kick in the first place. Newcastle also have a few tall, strong players in their team, which means weâll have to stay focused when defending corners; having Giroud back will certainly help with that.

ARSENAL:

 - Finding space

Against Liverpool, Newcastle closed up much of the space stopping, them from passing their way forward. In response, Liverpool used the massive spaces behind Newcastleâs back line to break into quickly. The result of that game may encourage Newcastle to be a bit more cautious (giving us the space to pass it around in front of them, trying to create gaps), or they may decide to stick with that game plan and squeeze the centre of the pitch (which Wigan did on Tuesday and we were more than happy to exploit).

 - Exploiting their LB

Either Santon will be fit enough to come back, or Yanga-Mbiwa will start again at LB - the positive for us is that the defensive positioning of both players is suspect. If Walcott can stay out wide to the right, he should be able to find some joy in the area - by winning 1-on-1s, exploiting the space they leave behind, or breaking inside to get between the LB and left sided CB. Gutierrez may be more reserved and help to cover that wing, so doubling up with Sagna will help to break them down in this area. If we can get some good crosses in, we may even see a headed goal from Giroud.

 - How to fill the âArteta Holeâ

Newcastleâs main threats probably come from Ben Arfa and Gouffran. If we can keep Ben Arfa quiet, then our next biggest problem is Gouffran. Normally, this wouldnât be much of an issue - but with Arteta being unlikely to play, it becomes something that takes a bit more consideration.

Weâre likely to start with Ramsey at CDM, and heâll need to pay close attention to Gouffranâs game if we are to keep it tight at the back. If he plays in a CAM position, Ramseyâs job will be to stop him from getting involved in the buildup, marking him out of the game; if he plays in a more advanced position, Ramsey needs to leave Gouffran to our CBs to deal with, but be very watchful of late midfield runs into the box from players like Ben Arfa, Gutierrez and Cabaye.

**Finally...**

We really need a win here - and if Newcastle need anything, itâs probably for this season to be over. I think this will be *the* defining feature of tomorrowâs game. There are a few tactical points to consider, but this game is more about will and determination than tactical superiority.

* Team Selection

[Possible line-ups for both teams](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5MSm_SLJtbKQUlMSWRkRmxaWDQ/edit?usp=sharing)

WEST BROM: [Last weekâs formation/tactics](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5MSm_SLJtbKM2JLcXF5UTN2NTA/edit?usp=sharing) A couple of changes from last weekâs line-up. Most notably, Mulumbu is suspended as he received a straight red card for [booting the ball at Gary OâNeil at the very end of last weekâs game.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGMGsgDth68) West Brom are a little thin on the ground for natural central midfielders, so Dorrans (who played RM last week) is likely to come across to what is apparently his more natural position. As a result, I would start Odemwingie at RM, despite his recent history - he came on in the 2nd half v West Ham and was very impressive.

West Brom played with 2 strikers against West Ham, despite being away from home. It seemed to me that they thought they would have more of the ball, thus be the more attacking and dangerous team. In reality, they struggled to get the ball out of midfield into their 2 strikers to actual attack; and when defending, West Ham usually played over the top of their midfield - or on the odd occasion, passed around them. If they werenât planning on trying to match Arsenalâs 3 man midfield, then after last weekâs performance they should be. So because of that, Iâve put Brunt at CAM, putting another body in the middle of the park, bringing Thomas in to fill his LM spot.

So theyâre likely to go with only one striker, and I struggled to chose between Long and Lukaku - but went with Lukaku in the end because he caused more of an aerial threat, and West Brom will likely find that useful at set pieces (which Iâll cover later).

**EDIT: Following the discussion that went on [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1bq6ml/formation_and_tactics_for_upcoming_fixture_v_west/c991n6i), it seems more likely that Long will start ahead of Lukaku.**

ARSENAL: [Canât see the selection being much different from last weekâs](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5MSm_SLJtbKR2c3Sk5vYndiMm8/edit?usp=sharing). Podolski will probably be fully match fit again, and I can see him starting. Rosicky didnât play badly last Saturday, but he was the midfielder I dropped because, with Cazorla coming inside to CAM, I couldnât see Wenger choosing Rosicky over Ramsey for the box-to-box-style CM position. (Wilshere is being given extra time to recover from his niggle or whatever it is, so heâs unavailable, as is Walcott.)

Gervinho has been on a little run recently; so even though The Ox came on and did well on Saturday, I think Wenger will keep him on the bench again.

Apart from that, Monrealâs self-inflicted injury and Gibbsâ solid performance from Saturday will put Gibbs at LB, and the rest of the back 4+GK are likely to stay the same.

* Tactics

WEST BROM:

 -Build up play

Iâm not entirely sure how theyâll approach this game. This season they have tried to play a more passing-orientated game, and they did try to work the ball up the field gradually against West Ham. But they never really managed to get the ball into Long and Lukaku - either the passes and crosses to them were intercepted, or once they received the pass they were immediately dispossessed. West Brom may try to gradually pass up to the ST(s) - if so, Arsenal wouldnât be required to defend very differently from they way they did on Saturday; they may have to try a little harder and do it more often, but doing a similar task. So West Brom may try to sit off Arsenal a little, battle in midfield, then break quickly. ~~But Long would probably be a better option for that type of game, and as I said earlier, I think theyâll want Lukaku in there for set pieces, which may well be their main form of attack.~~ Long will be a good option for that style of play.

 -Set Pieces

In the first 10 minutes of last weekâs game, West Brom won a corner, and Brunt put in a great delivery to the back post. McAuley attacked it, and in the process took out Jaaskelainen who had managed to get his hands on it. The ball ended up in the back of the net, but West Ham were given a free kick since McAuley fouled the keeper. This wasnât the only time West Brom threatened from corners and free kicks, but West Brom didnât manage to score any goals from them. Brunt and Dorrans put some great deliveries in, but either Carroll headed them away or Jaaskelainen cleared them. **This is exactly what we need from our GK on Saturday.** We need confident goalkeeping to take care of the dangerous deliveries from set pieces. West Ham would have been in a lot more trouble and definitely would have conceded from these situations if Jaaskelainen hadnât been so confident and commanding of his area. We need that. We struggled a little with Readingâs crossing and corners, so we must improve that this week.

 -Other threats

Arsenal will need to look out for long shots. Long, Dorrans and Lukaku all attempted fairly accurate and powerful long shots last week, and Chris Brunt is very capable when shooting from range as well. Arteta and Ramsey (or his replacement) will need to make sure that they avoid giving these players the space to get a long range shot away.

We will also need to carefully track their overlapping full backs. Billy Jones had a chance near the start of the second half by getting in behind the back 4 and taking advantage of Jarvis not tracking him accurately; Long and Dorrans made some good moves to create the space, and a better finish from Jones could have hit the back of the net. Also, [Brunt often floated inside off the left wing, and the space he created was attacked by Ridgewell](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5MSm_SLJtbKTndfV0UzN1F6dG8/edit?usp=sharing). He did a good job of getting parallel to the West Ham box and trying to gets some crosses away.

ARSENAL:

 -Build up play:

We did a pretty good job of breaking down Reading's defense on Saturday. Good movement from Gervinho and Cazorla coming off the wings was instrumental in 2 of our goals, drawing the defenders out of position - catching all 4 of them out at some point. Playing that way again is likely to be a strong tactic. The West Brom midfielders will do a better job of closing us down and putting in challenges than Reading's midfielders, but I still feel that we will be able to break them down. West Ham had a lot of joy playing very directly, getting the ball up to Carroll and having the 3 AMs run past him onto his flick-ons. I canât see us playing like that tomorrow, but we have scored a couple of counter attack goals through Gervinho in our past couple of league games, and we may get another one like that. West Hamâs second goal came from a counter attack after Jaaskelainen made a great clearance from a Brunt free-kick - just before OâNeil receives the ball, they have a 4v3 on the edge of the box. If we can do that, we could create a dangerous chance.

West Brom did a good job of keeping Jarvis on his left foot and Carroll on his right - they knew that Jarvisâ crosses with his right foot and Carrollâs left foot shots would be dangerous. They will do the same again this week, trying to keep Cazorla on his left and Giroud on his right. I reckon theyâll try to keep Gervinho on his left and Podolski on his right too. Equally, West Ham kept Brunt off his left when he was in shooting positions, and weâll need to do that too.

 -Set pieces:

Cazorlaâs corners were pretty bad last week - many of them going straight to Pogrebnyak at the front post. If we manage to get some better deliveries from him this week, we may be able to cause the same problems that West Ham did last week.  West Bromâs defending of set pieces was ok in general, but West Ham scored a goal each from a corner and a free kick. Both times Carroll got the better of Olsson, losing his marker and finishing accurately, giving Foster no chance. Olsson will probably try hard to improve that part of his game by this weekend, but we could still try to exploit that - IF we put in some better deliveries.

 -Other threats

Weâve got some good pace in the team. Gervinho is fairly quick, but not as fast as Podolski, The Ox or Walcott - thereâs definitely a threat there. I doubt West Brom will play the offside trap, so theyâll sit back - we can use the space in front of their back 4 to create some chances.

* Finally...

This game wonât be as easy as last weekâs. But we still have a good chance to collect all 3 points here. If we donât allow them headers in our box, we should be able to win the midfield easily - and then itâs all about what we do in attack. Iâm predicting 2-0 or 2-1 to Arsenal.

1372200531.0,90,self.Gunners,1h2ii6,I've been following Higuain since he was 18. And I would like to share some facts about him.,fffsffffffffff,111,21,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1h2ii6/ive_been_following_higuain_since_he_was_18_and_i/,"-In 2006, an 18 year Higuain started in front of a 20 year old Falcao at River Plate.

-In 2010, he was 2nd in goals in La Liga (27 goals in 32 games)

- Since 1970, only Batistuta had a better goals to game ratio than Higuain on the national team. A better ratio than **Messi**, **Maradona**, Aguero, and Crespo.

-In this WCQ cycle, he has 9 goals in the 11 games he played. He leads the south americans qualifiers in goals.

-If he is anything like the previous Argentines' number 9s, he still perform at world class level well into his 30s.

-His numbers have been on the decline since Ronaldo emerged as the Real Madrid focal point in the attack. He takes the most shots on the team.

-No forward in the world can succeed in a system where the winger takes more than twice as many shots as the two forwards combined.


He is one of those players who always seems to be a the right spot at the right time. If he is the focal point of the attack and healthy, he will get at least 25 goals next season. He is slightly underrated when it comes to dribbling but he is no where as good as the other Argentine forwards. (Messi, Aguero, and Tevez). However, he is a much better finisher than Aguero and Tevez. Another negative aspect about him is sometimes, he is inconsistent. (It's probably because his confidence is shaken, playing in such a cut throat place). If he plays like how he plays on the National team, he'll be up there with Suarez and RVP as the best number 9s in the world. His worth will be doubled. If he remains healthy and is the starting forward, this well be one of the best transfer steals.

For me he still remains a player who can tear apart weaker teams, but is useless against anyone with a decent defence to contain him.  There is no denying he has been one of our best players this season, but that isn't an argument for keeping him, as Stephen Fletcher is one of Sunderland's, but that doesn't mean he is a world class player.  

So, the question for you guys is, am I completely wrong and has Theo finally made it?  Are we all just jumping on the bandwagon of he who scores goals, as most of us did with Gervinho at the beginning of the year?  Is it the case that the knowledge that we will very rarely buy big in the transfer market, combined with the narrative of 'Arsenal sell their best players' make Theo seem far more valuable than he actually is?

First of all in my opinion, as good as he is (and that is very good) there is not a chance in the world he could recreate last season again. Over the years he's constantly had niggling injuries etc. and last year was just a fortunate year for both him and yourselves. I highly doubt a player can get less injury prone as he gets older and in saying that, I wouldn't be surprised in he gets a few injuries at Utd.

While he was a dick to say he wasn't going to re-sign and if he had more than a year left on his contract, might have gone for more, but I still believe getting Â£24mil for him and having Podolski and Giroud in the squad put you in a better attacking position than you were last year.

Urawa plays host to Arsenal on July 26. Here is a short guide to the club.

##History

Urawa Reds was founded in 1950 by Shin-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and participated in the former Japan Soccer League when it began in 1965. They were the first Japanese club to complete a domestic treble, winning the JSL title, the Emperor's Cup, and the Japan Soccer League Cup in 1978.

##In The J.League

Urawa was one of the founding members of the J.League in 1993, and finished in last place the first two years of the league. Since winning the Nabisco Cup in 2003, however, they have improved immensely.

From 2004-2007 Urawa experienced a ""golden age"", where they finished 2nd three times and won the title once (in 2006). During that time they also won the Emperor's Cup twice and the AFC Champions League once.

Urawa currently sits in 4th place with 31 points over 17 matches played. Their record is 9-4-4.

##Amazing Support

Urawa Reds are the most supported club in Japan, with attendances easily surpassing 35,000 people per game most days (This year their highest attendance was 52,293). Their highest average attendance in a single year was 47,000, which they accomplished in 2008.

They have had the highest average attendance in the J.League for fourteen of the J.League's twenty seasons.

[Here is a video of their amazing supporters in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47zTm4SECU4).

###Key Players

**Yuki Abe** - Abe made his debut in the J.League in 1998 at the age of 16 (at the time the youngest player to make his professional debut in Japan). After refining his skills in Japan over 12 seasons, Abe was traded by Urawa to Leicester City of the Championship in 2010. 2 years and 52 matches later his contract was cancelled by mutual consent due to him suffering from homesickness, and Abe returned to Urawa. A former staple of the Japan national team, Abe is a solid Defensive Midfielder who has experience playing against big clubs.

* Age: 31

* Position: Defensive Midfielder

* Japan NT Caps: 53

* [Goal vs Ipswich Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDXde9A8Zko)

**Genki Haraguchi** - An up and coming striker, Haraguchi has scored for Urawa 7 times in 16 matches this season, and has provided 6 assists. Turkish club Besiktas was reportedly interested in him last year.

* Age: 22

* Position: Striker

* Japan NT Caps: 1

* [Montage of his skills and goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYsEVCu3gkw)

**Tomoaki Makino** - Failing to play more than 8 matches for FC Koln of the Bundesliga during his only season there, Makino came to Urawa in 2012 (first on loan, then as a transfer). Makino is a solid center back who can score the occasional goal.

* Age: 26

* Position: Center-Back

* Japan NT Caps: 10

* [Fantastic free kick goal](http://youtu.be/eCFN53ACwZ8?t=47s)

###Other Key Players
