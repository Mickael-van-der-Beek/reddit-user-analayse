1354658024.0,933,self.Buddhism,14a8nc,The premise of Buddhism in simple English:,phillydrew,1133,200,206,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/14a8nc/the_premise_of_buddhism_in_simple_english/,"A friend of mine once asked about what Buddhism was all about. I wrote this up for him. Hope you get a few laughs.

There was this guy named Buddha. He realized that people can be really selfish and sometimes really stupid. They get upset because their lives are really sucky and all they did was blame other people for their problems. He felt bad and tried to figure it out. Aside from the inevitables like, birth, growth, illness, and death, he figured out there was a way to not be so affected by the situations that life presented. He presented four absolute (noble) truths and 8 ways to realize them.

**4 noble truths:**

1. life can suck.

2. it sucks because we get attached to the stuff that we imagine makes
     our selves ""unique"" and ""special.""

3. There is a way to not be affected by the suckness.

4. If we open our eyes and follow eight simple methods,
      we can be freed from letting the suckness affect us.

**8 fold path:**

1. No one is absolute nor omnipotent. We're all pretty ignorant.


2. If you don't learn to stop and say, ""hey, i don't know"" you're not going to change yourself
      in a way that's going to free you from the suckness.


3. Don't open your mouth without considering wtf it's going to
     sound like to the person on the receiving end.


4. You're not the center of the universe. Your actions not only affect everything around
     you, they can affect everything around the people around you.
     Don't do stupid shit that's going to hurt other people or yourself.


5. Don't take action that's going to make life suck for other people at your benefit.


6. If something pisses you off, figure out if you need to fix yourself first. Otherwise,


7. Know the consequences of your actions, you dumb fuck.
     Moreover, everyone has their own reality and their own right to their own level of dumbfuckery.
     When you make a mistake (you will), don't be proud, admit it, and be open to remedy yourself
     and the situation. And when in a group take care to not act unless it benefits the group in someway.


8. If you don't pay attention to the task at hand you're going to have a bad time.
    (Stop texting and pay attention to the wheel, you dumb fuck)

There is a natural process at work that WILL reduce the quality of content of any rapidly expanding subreddit without action. As a 6+ year reddit user, I have seen it happen again and again and again.
If we don't make a decision now about the kind of community we want to have here, the subreddit will eventually become overrun with lowest common denominator type bullshit like memes and image macros. Right now there's still a lot worth saving, but there's not much time left. We are at the tipping point, and it's starting to run away from us as we speak.

**Why and how does this process happen?**

Meme comments by their nature attract upvotes easily, because they are short and can be read quickly, are funny and clever at first, inspire an 'in joke' sort of feeling (if you're cool and get it, you upvote). We'll call this LOW-EFFORT CONTENT. Longer, more insightful comments, the kind that makes this one of my favorite subreddits, take longer to read, you don't always agree with them, and in general require much more effort from the reader to earn upvotes. We'll call this HIGH-EFFORT CONTENT.

So to begin with, even in a community that is naturally biased against memes, they have a competitive advantage over interesting comments. So even if most people in the subreddit are against memes, they can still rise to prominence, because it's just easier to read and upvote them.

Second, this effect is greatly exacerbated when new users who don't get the ethos of the subreddit join. They are far more likely to engage in low effort upvoting behavior. Once a subreddit reaches a certain critical mass, low effort content beats high effort content, every time. It sucks, but that's how it is. So you have to make a choice about which you would rather have.

As a subreddit gets diluted with more new users, the high-effort, mind expanding comments are overwhelmed by low effort jokes, and valuable contributors become discouraged and stop contributing as much. Once they start gaining a toehold, people writing and reading mind-expanding comments are going to look elsewhere, and as the size of the subreddit expands people will spend more time contributing memes, because that's what works. All of a sudden you have a crap subreddit.

It's a really poisonous process that has ruined many a subreddit. What we have learned is that unless you have a very clear vision of the kind of subreddit you want to have, and moderate accordingly, you will eventually end up with a memebin. /r/askscience has been very successful in maintaining the quality of their subreddit as subscribers have increased, because they insist that only science gets posted in /r/askscience, and anything that isn't gets removed. Their achievement is really quite incredible. Almost 250,000 users and every article and comment is thought-provoking, intelligent and on-topic.

**I hereby propose that only thought-provoking, mind-expanding, buddhist-related articles and comments are appropriate in this subreddit.** 

It's why I come here. This is subjective and obviously needs discussion, but if we don't make this choice now, we are choosing to have dumbed down memes, jokes, pictures, etc as the primary content in this subreddit, with interesting stuff being mostly relegated to the sidelines. It WILL happen soon. It's just a matter of time. The process really starts to pick up speed around 25,000/30,000 subscribers.

**Moderators, you need to step up. Only you can stop this from happening.**

P.S. If you like buddhist memes, there's probably enough of an audience now to support a *buddhist memes* reddit or something like that. Somebody start one.

The moment your mind takes control of your present state of consciousness and begins to think about worries and fears of the future, is the moment you have left behind your true state of consciousness. Ending your suffering means to end the mind's illusion of a past or future.

This is the thought process the ego feeds and thrives on, but it's not who you really are. It is whatever that is happening in this present moment, in the now, that we should be in harmony with. Live in the present moment, be aware of every second that ticks, and react to what is around you. This is what Bruce Lee, along with Tao and Buddhist practitioners mean when they say ""be like water"". Water conforms or reacts with its immediate environment instantly, and yet as calm and timid as it may seem, it is more importantly the most efficient reaction.

As we live our daily lives, we might be able to smoothen our days by practicing to not label or judge things as they happen, just witness what's happening and continue on your path accordingly. The moment you see a bird flyby and ask yourself what type of bird it is, you have escaped the present moment of experiencing the bird's flyby, and you have ventured into a world of illusion, one of thought form where past and future is falsely exalted. Your path itself is an ongoing quest, unfolding itself to you after each moment that passes. Be in tune with the present moment and watch your life reach success with efficiency and contentment.

He has written an amazing, heartfelt letter to shooter Adam Lanza, that you can read here:

Saturday, 15th of December, 2012
Dharma Cloud Temple
Plum Village

Dear Adam,

Let me start by saying that I wish for you to find peace. It would be easy just to call you a monster and condemn you for evermore, but I don't think that would help either of us. Given what you have done, I realize that peace may not be easy to find. In a fit of rage, delusion and fear—yes, above all else, I think, fear—you thought that killing was a way out. It was clearly a powerful emotion that drove you from your mother's dead body to massacre children and staff of Sandy Hook School and to turn the gun in the end on yourself. You decided that the game was over.

But the game is not over, though you are dead. You didn't find a way out of your anger and loneliness. You live on in other forms, in the torn families and their despair, in the violation of their trust, in the gaping wound in a community, and in the countless articles and news reports spilling across the country and the world—yes, you live on even in me. I was also a young boy who grew up in Newtown. Now I am a Zen Buddhist monk. I see you quite clearly in me now, continued in the legacy of your actions, and I see that in death you have not become free.

You know, I used to play soccer on the school field outside the room where you died, when I was the age of the children you killed. Our team was the Eagles, and we won our division that year. My mom still keeps the trophy stashed in a box. To be honest, I was and am not much of a soccer player. I've known winning, but I've also known losing, and being picked last for a spot on the team. I think you've known this too—the pain of rejection, isolation and loneliness. Loneliness too strong to bear.

You are not alone in feeling this. When loneliness comes up it is so easy to seek refuge in a virtual world of computers and films, but do these really help or only increase our isolation? In our drive to be more connected, have we lost our true connection?

I want to know what you did with your loneliness. Did you ever, like me, cope by walking in the forests that cover our town? I know well the slope that cuts from that school to the stream, shrouded by beech and white pine. It makes up the landscape of my mind. I remember well the thrill of heading out alone on a path winding its way—to Treadwell Park! At that time it felt like a magical path, one of many secrets I discovered throughout those forests, some still hidden. Did you ever lean your face on the rough furrows of an oak's bark, feeling its solid heartwood and tranquil vibrancy? Did you ever play in the course of a stream, making pools with the stones as if of this stretch you were king? Did you ever experience the healing, connection and peace that comes with such moments, like I often did?

Or did your loneliness know only screens, with dancing figures of light at the bid of your will? How many false lives have you lived, how many shots fired, bombs exploded and lives lost in video games and movies?

By killing yourself at the age of 20, you never gave yourself the chance to grow up and experience a sense of how life's wonders can bring happiness. I know at your age I hadn't yet seen how to do this.

I am 37 now, about the age my teacher, the Buddha, realized there was a way out of suffering. I am not enlightened. This morning, when I heard the news, and read the words of my shocked classmates, within minutes a wave of sorrow arose, and I wept. Then I walked a bit further, into the woods skirting our monastery, and in the wet, winter cold of France, beside the laurel, I cried again. I cried for the children, for the teachers, for their families. But I also cried for you, Adam, because I think that I know you, though I know we have never met. I think that I know the landscape of your mind, because it is the landscape of my mind.

I don't think you hated those children, or that you even hated your mother. I think you hated your loneliness.

I cried because I have failed you. I have failed to show you how to cry. I have failed to sit and listen to you without judging or reacting. Like many of my peers, I left Newtown at seventeen, brimming with confidence and purpose, with the congratulations of friends and the approbation of my elders. I was one of the many young people who left, and in leaving we left others, including you, just born, behind. In that sense I am a part of the culture that failed you. I didn't know yet what a community was, or that I was a part of one, until I no longer had it, and so desperately needed it.

I have failed to be one of the ones who could have been there to sit and listen to you. I was not there to help you to breathe and become aware of your strong emotions, to help you to see that you are more than just an emotion.

But I am also certain that others in the community cared for you, loved you. Did you know it?

In eighth grade I lived in terror of a classmate and his anger. It was the first time I knew aggression. No computer screen or television gave a way out, but my imagination and books. I dreamt myself a great wizard, blasting fireballs down the school corridor, so he would fear and respect me. Did you dream like this too?

The way out of being a victim is not to become the destroyer. No matter how great your loneliness, how heavy your despair, you, like each one of us, still have the capacity to be awake, to be free, to be happy, without being the cause of anyone's sorrow. You didn't know that, or couldn't see that, and so you chose to destroy. We were not skillful enough to help you see a way out.

With this terrible act you have let us know. Now I am listening, we are all listening, to you crying out from the hell of your misunderstanding. You are not alone, and you are not gone. And you may not be at peace until we can stop all our busyness, our quest for power, money or sex, our lives of fear and worry, and really listen to you, Adam, to be a friend, a brother, to you. With a good friend like that your loneliness might not have overwhelmed you.

But we needed your help too, Adam. You needed to let us know that you were suffering, and that is not easy to do. It means overcoming pride, and that takes courage and humility. Because you were unable to do this, you have left a heavy legacy for generations to come. If we cannot learn how to connect with you and understand the loneliness, rage and despair you felt—which also lie deep and sometimes hidden within each one of us—not by connecting through Facebook or Twitter or email or telephone, but by really sitting with you and opening our hearts to you, your rage will manifest again in yet unforeseen forms.

Now we know you are there. You are not random, or an aberration. Let your action move us to find a path out of the loneliness within each one of us. I have learned to use awareness of my breath to recognize and transform these overwhelming emotions, but I hope that every man, woman or child does not need to go halfway across the world to become a monk to learn how to do this. As a community we need to sit down and learn how to cherish life, not with gun-checks and security, but by being fully present for one another, by being truly there for one another. For me, this is the way to restore harmony to our communion.

Things like Calvin &amp; Hobbes comics and Big Bang Theory quotes are being vastly outvoted over pithy and profound discussions of Buddhist philosophy - for example, the ""Life of Zen,"" a 26 minute video discussion with one of *the* great Western interpreters of Eastern religion, which quotes and discusses the Chinese masters' paradoxical koans, the nature of dharma dhatu, and so on, got 27 times fewer votes than the votes for an American comedy sitcom quote. 

It strikes me that we are leaning here towards a more ""pop Buddhism"" based subreddit, with frivolous and very loosely relevant posts being the most successful. That's fine, but I sense that this subreddit could be much more than that and I want to know if that's what you guys want this to be - a ""pop Buddhism"" subreddit.

Buddhism is not simply a belief in ""taking it slow,"" and while that characterization may loosely sum up certain Buddhist sentiments, it seems to be all a lot of the comic/image posts that get upvoted here tend to say. 

That said, I have found great content on this subreddit and it's a great community. I would love to hear your thoughts/comments, agreements/disagreements.

I had fallen for my thoughts, hook, line and sinker. I believed that thoughts were solid, rock-like constructs that would inevitably alter my state of mind. I accepted good and bad moods without really questioning my own thinking. When I had a thought such as 'I'm lonely and will be single for ages', I believed that I SHOULD be feeling bad, and feeling bad was a punishment for being lonely. Because the thoughts were there, I saw them as natural and perhaps more importantly, as *necessary*. 

I realised today that it's completely up to me which thoughts I attach meaning to and turn from transparent clouds to rocks. The emotion generated in my head is a by-product of taking every thought that arises seriously. So it's now a choice I can make there and then.

 I want to develop this to the point where I can note the unhelpful thoughts, but not 'engage' them and attach meaning to them. Am I on the right lines?",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,,True,t3_1095n6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1095n6/ive_just_had_a_huge_realisation_i_can_control_my/,

1366735072.0,229,self.Buddhism,1cy0gn,"I was a Buddhist monk of the Thai Theravadan/Forest tradition who was at the first joint Theravadan Bhikkhuni/nun ordination in the West. I spent time at Abhayagiri, US and Thai temples/monasteries. Come friends, let us share questions, answers, and stories. AMAA",ThisBuddhistLovesYou,259,30,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1cy0gn/i_was_a_buddhist_monk_of_the_thai/,"For now, I am but a layman - but throughout the experiences I have been able to have, I have been told I am quite lucky though I don't believe in the concept of luck. I wish to share some of my experiences with /r/Buddhism, and learn about yours in return. (Especially zen, which has always fascinated me but I am woefully nescient in.)

I was ordained by the Venerable *Phra Maha Prasert Kavissaro* of Wat Buddhanusorn in Fremont, California in the Summer of 2010, with the intent to spend a few weeks in robes following extensive practice throughout my life. I ended up spending a bit less than a year in the monkhood. During that time I spent a few weeks at Abhayagiri Forest Monastery practising in the style of the Venerable *Ajahn Chah* under the Ven *Ajahn Pasanno* - and while I had previously read the works of the Ven *Thanissaro Bhikkhu* or *Ajahn Geoff* as we affectionately called him, I then had the chance to intensively analyse sections of various Tripitaka interpretations alongside secluded meditation in the middle of the forest. My third main teacher is Ven *Ajahn Roemchai Chinwangso* of the Thai Forest Tradition under Ven *Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo* and Ven *Luang-pu Mun Bhuritatto*.

Those are my main influences and teachers, I am also greatly indebted to others such as *Bhante Henepola Gunaratana* (*Bhante G*) and *(Bhikkhuni/Sister) Ayya Tathaaloka* and Ven *Ajahn Amaro*.

I traveled often, studying mainly Thai Theravadan and Forest Traditions, with forages into Sri Lankan Theravada, Chinese Mahayana, and Zen. I sought to answer my own questions about the nature of existence and human suffering, especially after experiencing my own personal crippling depression following time spent at the Concentration Camps in Europe, the Killing Fields of Cambodia, and seeing the devastation in the wake of the Christmas Tsunami.

I am happy to have borne witness to the first joint Theravadan Bhikkhuni ordination in the western hemisphere (probably the 2nd or 3rd overall in over a thousand years while the Mahayana kept the tradition strong) and weathered the political aftermath. While the main institutions of Theravadan Buddhism still struggle with equality issues, it is my understanding that the Buddha saw the truth beyond human societal concepts of sex and gender; the restoration of the Bhikkhuni Sangha brings us closer to the original inception of the Sangha under the Buddha and equality. 

So ask away! My areas of expertise lie in: Thai Theravadan Buddhism, the Maha Nikaya and the Thammayut Nikaya branches... particularly of the Thai Forest Tradition under Venerables Ajahn Chah and Ajahn Mun, the differences between Traditional Thai Buddhism, Thai-American Buddhism, and the International (farang) brand of Theravadan Buddhism growing around the world that is far more accessible to English-speakers/foreigners, or general questions about my experiences, monastic life, and my personal understanding of Buddhism. I make no claims to have reached any high level of practice, jhanas, or anywhere close to enlightenment. I will only share and offer you glimpses of the path. You can teach me much as well just by being here.

My own beliefs are perhaps more secular humanist and liberal than those of my teachers. I am willing to answer almost any of your questions now and for the next week or so. Please forgive me if any of my answers are not that of proper dhamma, and recognise that they come from my own understanding, and do not represent those of my teachers.

I want to point out that while some of us feel strongly one way or the other, few descended into name calling or anger. That is much appreciated, and one of my fears when I posted the original.

We have decided to ban images containing any text. 

These are the primary reasons:

First, we do not want this sub to be overrun with these types of posts, and it could descend into this very quickly if we do not take action now. It will be MUCH harder to do this if these posts start to be prevalent. 

Second, the vocal minority are the ones that care enough to post the content that keeps this sub relevant and useful. As I said in one comment, as long as we keep quality posts and responses here we will always have subscribers. This vocal minority seems to favor a ban. 

Actually, I am not even sure that the people who want a ban are a minority. All I can really say is that the majority of responders favor a ban overwhelmingly.

Third, and perhaps most important, we do not want to have the casual visitor read these highly upvoted posts and go away thinking they represent Buddhism. I understand that the comments provide a check for this, but I know that I don't read the comments in many subs that I browse.

Finally, while the up and down vote system works for some things, it does not work in this case. It is clear that the majority who care enough to contribute favor a ban. It is the contributors that keep quality discussion going.

The reason we favor an outright ban is because we don't have the time to research these quotes effectively.

I want to extend our thanks and respect to paxfeline, indigloigloo, eiphren, and others who argued their points well.

I know how much it has helped lots of other people, and that it is a core tenet of the Buddha's teaching. However, I was never able to consistently sit—I would get a string of 3 or 4 days, and then would slack off for 2 or 3 weeks.

The other night, I decided to meditate on why I don't meditate. I discovered that I was being too self-critical. I have trouble calming down my monkey mind when I meditate, i.e. I have a pretty consistent stream of worrying thoughts while I try to meditate. This would frustrate me, causing me to think ""I'm just no good at meditating."" Since I wasn't good, I didn't want to do it.

When I thought about this, it really didn't make any sense. If the only point of meditating was to be good at it, then why do it in the first place? I was too focused on the result, which is out of my control. I know now that instead, I should focus on the action, the journey, which I am responsible for.

Besides, my meditation is no better or worse than it is. The only reason I thought I was ""bad"" at it, was because I was attached to an expectation of what it *should be*.

They sat by the side of a lake and closed their eyes in concentration. Then suddenly, the first one stood up and said, ""I forgot my mat.""

When he returned, the second monk stood up and said, ""I forgot to put my other underwear to dry."" He too walked calmly across the water and returned the same way.

The third monk watched the first two carefully in what he decided must be the test of his own abilities. ""Is your learning so superior to mine? I too can match any feat you two can perform,"" he declared loudly and rushed to the water's edge to walk across it. He promptly fell into the deep water. 

Undeterred, the yogi climbed out of the water and tried again, only to sink into the water. Yet again he climbed out and yet again he tried, each time sinking into the water. This went on for some time as the other two monks watched.

1357081719.0,200,self.Buddhism,15sk1n,10 Must Read Life Lessons from Buddha,Sterkelee,261,61,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/15sk1n/10_must_read_life_lessons_from_buddha/,"*Siddhartha Gautama was a great spiritual leader from ancient India who founded Buddhism. In most Buddhist traditions, he is considered the Supreme Buddha. “Buddha” is interpreted to mean “awakened one” or “the enlightened one.” Siddhartha is the primary figure in Buddhism, and the accounts of his life, teachings, and monastic rules were recapitulated after his death and memorized by his followers.*

*Today I want to discuss some very important life lessons which I’ve derived from the teachings of Buddha.*

*     **10 Must Read Life Lessons from Buddha:**

**1. Its Okay to Start Small**

*“A jug fills drop by drop.”*

Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “Every artist was once an amateur.”

We all start small, do not despise small beginnings. If you’re consistent, and if you’re patient, you will succeed! No one succeeds over night; success belongs to those who are willing to start small and patiently work until their jug is filled.

**2. Thoughts Become Things**

*“All that we are is the result of what we have thought. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him. If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him.”*

Buddha said, “The mind is everything. What you think you become.” James Allen said, “Man is mind.”

In order to live rightly, you must fill your mind with “right” thoughts.

Your thinking determines your actions; your actions determine your outcome. Right thinking will grant you everything you desire; wrong thinking is a vice that will eventually destroy you.

If you change your thinking you will change your life. Buddha said, “All wrong-doing arises because of mind. If mind is transformed can wrong-doing remain?”

**3. Forgive**

*“Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.”*

When you release those who you are holding captive in the prison of un-forgiveness, it is you who is released from prison. You can’t keep someone down, without staying down with them. Learn to forgive, learn to forgive quickly.

**4. It’s Your Actions That Count**

*“However many holy words you read, however many you speak, what good will they do you if you do not act on upon them?”*

They say “Talk is cheap,” because it is. To progress you must act; to progress quickly, you must act daily. Greatness will not fall upon you!

Greatness is for everyone, but only those who are willing to act consistently will experience it. There’s a proverb that goes, “God gives every bird a worm, but he doesn’t throw it into their nest.” To be great you must act great. Buddha said, “I do not believe in a fate that falls on men however they act; but I do believe in a fate that falls on them unless they act.”

**5. Seek to Understand**

*“In a controversy the instant we feel anger we have already ceased striving for the truth, and have begun striving for ourselves.”*

Stephen Covey said, “Seek to understand first, then to be understood.” Easily said, very difficult to do; you must labor to understand the “other” person’s perspective. When you feel anger rising, let it cease. Listen to others, understand their perspective, and you will have more peace. Be more concerned with being happy, than being right.

**6. Conquer Yourself**

*“It is better to conquer yourself than to win a thousand battles. Then the victory is yours. It cannot be taken from you, not by angels or by demons, heaven or hell.”*

He who can conquer himself is greater than the mighty. To conquer yourself you must conquer your mind. You must control your thinking. Your thoughts cannot be tossed to and fro like the waves of the sea. You may be thinking, “I can’t control my thoughts, if a thought comes, it comes.” To that I say, you may not be able to stop a bird from flying over your head, but you can certainly stop him from building a nest in your hair. Dismiss thoughts that are contrary to the life you desire to live. Buddha said, “It is a man’s own mind, not his enemy or foe that lures him to evil ways.”

**7. Live in Peace**

*“Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.”*

Don’t look without for something that can only be found within. Many times we may look without only to distract ourselves from the reality we know is true. That reality is that peace can only be found within. Peace is not a new job, peace is not a new car, or a new spouse….peace is a new perspective, and that new perspective begins with you.

**8. Be Thankful**

*“Let us rise up and be thankful, for if we didn’t learn a lot today, at least we learned a little, and if we didn’t learn a little, at least we didn’t get sick, and if we got sick, at least we didn’t die; so, let us all be thankful.”*

There’s always something to be thankful for. Don’t be so pessimistic that for a moment, even a split moment, you fail to realize the thousands of things you have to be thankful for. Everyone didn’t wake up this morning; some people went to sleep last night for the last time. There’s always something to be grateful for, recognize it, and give thanks. A grateful heart will make you great!

**9. Be True to What You Know**

*“The only real failure in life is not to be true to the best one knows.”*

We know a lot, but we don’t always do what we know. If you fail, it won’t be because you didn’t know; it will be because you didn’t do what you knew to do. Work to do what you know to do. Don’t just consume information, but ponder on thoughts that are conducive to what you desire to become until you have a burning desire to manifest it.

**10. Travel Well**

*“It is better to travel well than to arrive.”*

Life is about the journey! I’m not trying to arrive, I’m already there. I am happy, and content, and satisfied where I am today. I may experience nicer places, and finer wines, but I am traveling well. Don’t put off your happiness into some nebulous time in the future based on some goal that you think will bring you happiness. Travel well today, enjoy the journey.

""All religions are the same. They just wanted you to be a nice person"". 

And she politely replied me with a citation similar to what my dad said from the bible
“So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets."" -Matthew 7:12

and I replied to them ""It is similar to the golden rule of life: Treat others as you would like to be treated by Confucius"". 

Then, she asked me what do I think of after life. I replied ""To sum up of what I think by my religion would be the past is the past, the future is unpredictable. What matters the most is to live in the present,"". I proceeded by showing her my Thai Buddhism locket from my dad telling her the locket is not meant for the future but as a charm to keep me safe in the present.  

She said she never had the chance to meet many Buddhists before so these point of views were new to her.

What other things do you think I should mention to people unaware of Buddhism in the future?

Having tethered them with a stout rope, he fastens the ropes together in the middle, he lets go of them. Now, monks, these six animals of different domains and feeding habits would swing around and struggle, each trying to get to his natural domain. The snake would struggle, thinking 'I'll get to the ant-hill'; the crocodile: 'I'll get into the water'; the bird: 'I'll fly up in the air'' the dog: 'I'll make for the village'; the jackal: 'I'll make for the charnel-ground'; the monkey: 'I'll head for the forest.'

""Now, monks, when those six hungry animals grew weary, they would yield to the one that was the strongest, go his way and be under his power. In the same way, monks, whenever a monk fails to practice and develop mindfulness as to body, the eye struggles to draw him towards attractive objects, while unattractive objects are repellent to him... The mind struggles to draw him towards attractive objects of thought, while unattractive objects of thought are repellent to him. This, monks, is lack of restraint. And what, monks, is restraint? In this, a monk, seeing objects with the eye, is not drawn to attractive objects, is not repelled by unattractive objects. He remains with firmly established mindfulness as to body, his mind being unrestricted.[1] He knows in truth that liberation of the heart, that liberation by wisdom,[2] through which those evil, unskilled states that have arisen pass away without remainder...

""Suppose a man catches six animals (as before), and he fastens the rope together to a stout post or pillar... Then, when those six animals grow weary, they would have to stand, crouch or lie down by the stout post or pillar. In the same way, monks, when a monk practices and develops mindfulness as to the body, the eye does not struggle to draw him towards attractive visual objects, nor are unattractive visual objects repellent to him... the mind does not struggle to draw him towards attractive objects of thought, nor are unattractive objects of thought repellent to him. This, monks, is restraint.

""'Tethered to a stout post or pillar,' monks, denotes mindfulness as to body. Therefore, monks, this is how you must train yourselves: 'We shall practice mindfulness as to body, develop it, make it our vehicle, our dwelling-place, our resort, we will build it up and undertake it thoroughly.'

Since I have been here, there have always been posts with images that have text superimposed. Often, even usually, this text is a fake Buddha quote or some other pithy witticism that is also often inaccurate.

 I have personally never liked these posts, but have had the philosophy that since some people seem to, I should just ignore them and move on. However, lately there has been some grumbling about them. In fairness, there may have always been, and I am just paying attention more now that I am a moderator.

On the other hand, these posts get many more upvotes than downvotes.

So, as a moderator, I would like to see if those that dislike the posts are simply a vocal minority, or if most people would like to see these types of posts banned?

I may have to work late tonight, but I will check out all the responses when I get home.


*Edit:* 
I have had a break from work, and I took a few minutes to read these.

I am strongly favoring an outright ban for several reasons.

First, the ""down the rabbit hole"" argument is compelling. To me, and obviously to several others, these posts are already annoying at best. We don't have to wait until we have explored the entire warren to do something.

Second, the vocal minority are the ones that care enough to post the content that keeps this sub relevant and useful. As I said in one comment, as long as we keep quality posts and responses here we will always have subscribers. This vocal minority seems to favor a ban.

Third, and perhaps most important, we do not want to have the casual visitor read these highly upvoted posts and go away thinking they represent Buddhism. I understand that the comments provide a check for this, but I know that I don't read the comments in many subs that I browse. 

The reason I favor an outright ban is because I don't have the time to research these quotes and I doubt other moderators do.

Finally, if these posts become the norm instead of the exception, and they seem to be starting to be more and more prevalent, this sub will be filled with bubblegum content.

Thanks for everyone's input, and I will message the mods tonight, after I get off work and attempt to get a consensus. I would hope to have a firm decision by tomorrow morning.

Began as a very yogically based practice, (LONG before there were any yoga asana classes in the States); this was pure practice based in the fundamental yogic tradition of Patanjali.  I studied and lived closely with a teacher for 6 years or so, then on my own but still in regular touch for years following.  I later shifted my orientation to a Buddhist approach, which I maintain to this day.
I've probably visited this board only 5 or 6 times since noticing it a year(?) or so ago. There are things that a simple, daily, disciplined practice make clear over time that, ideally, working closely with a conscientious teacher would clear up immediately.  I'm not a scholar, and make no claims to anything other than a prolonged and somewhat disciplined approach to practice, but if there were some basic assurances or 'angles' on sitting that I might be able to share with someone, with anyone, who was sincerely working with these things and didn't even have anyone to simply bounce a basic question off of, I'd be glad to sit for a couple of hours and respond.  
Again, I want to make it clear that I'm not a scholar, not 'looking for students, and was really raised up in the tradition of practice to 'work hard and shut up' about it. I.e., it's not something that I normally broadcast.  
Anyway .. I just did some answering of questions on another sub/r about working with Bruce Lee several years ago and it occurred to me after that what working with him really led me to was not furthering in martial arts but, rather, into an exploration of working with body and mind vis-a-vis a traditional yogic meditation practice and that THAT is really something that might be of value to someone younger and interested. 
So, thought I'd ask if this sounded like anything that might be of value to anyone here. I wouldn't see it as ""me telling you what's up"" .. but I thought it could be done as a little sort of round table discussion sort of thing, though it would be based in my background I guess.  I'll check back .. if it looks like it might, then I'll set a time or something.  If not .. thanks for your consideration of it.

2) When can I call myself a Buddhist (ie: change my Facebook status into ""Buddhist"")? Am I Buddhist yet?

3) I haven't read the sidebar and I've never heard of using Google or Wikipedia to research a topic. I wanna learn more about Buddhism. Halp?

4) *Just Be*. Present. Now. Breathe. *picture of clouds or a Thai monk watching the sunset.* Metta

7) Now, to include myself into this, there is now and then a thread - like this one - alarming people how most posts are not ""true Buddhism"" and proposing some solution: a new subreddit for real Buddhism, or abolishing link posts, or stronger moderation. These posts always produce useless controversy and amount to nothing.

8) Other stuff that has ***not much to do with Buddhism***.

To be completely blunt, I think the dominant ideology of /r/Buddhism, which can be put into a simple New Age mottoo: ""Just. Be. Here. Now."" has not much to do with real Buddhism, at all. I think it's in fact **the exact opposite of what the Buddha taught.** We purposelessly wander in samsara in birth-and-death **precisely** because we are always ""in the present moment"", attached to whatever the present experience seems to show, and fail to see the **big picture**. But the big picture that the Buddha wants us to see is exactly what the New Age ideology demands us to ditch (thinking about the big picture / future rebirth(s) / Nirvana is shunned as ""not being in the present moment"" or ""desiring enlightenment"" - as if it was bad! As if the Buddha didn't have a super-strong, stubborn desire for enlightenment that made him abandon the ""present moment"" of ""enjoying"" his time with his wife - *most future/goal-oriented guy ever*, far from the Big Lebowski, the Buddha was certainly *not* a ""chill dude"": look what he sacrificed! look how hard he practised! the discipline, the determination! ""I spit on my life - death would be better for me than not reaching my *goal*, victory over life and death""! - I paraphrase. Let's not fool ourselves here about who He was.)

All this was perfectly exemplified when someone posted a ""quote"" of Lord Buddha saying: ""Abandon past, abandon future, and embrace the present moment."" Needless to say this was another New Age forgery. A fake quote.

The **real** quote says **exactly the opposite**: let go of the past, future **and present**, and **cross over to the farthest shore of existence**. Now that's a completely different story, at least to me.

 Perhaps the first step would be to humble ourselves profoundly, and directing all questioners towards **real**, **sutra Buddhism**, and read the texts. The Zen guys love to say how their teaching is ""outside of scriptures"", but Bodhidharma handed the *Lankavatara Sutra* to Hui-ke, and Hui-Neng got enlightened hearing the *Diamond Sutra*. If you read the main text of Zen, the Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch of Zen, he says *studying the Diamond Sutra* is the main practice of Zen. ""Sit down and shut up!"" the ideology of Brad Warner the popularizer of Soto Zen, is just a very specific development of Buddhism (Japanese Soto Zen), and even that comes from someone who wrote the *Shobogenzo*, the biggest fat-ass text you'll ever hold in your hands. Zen, too, is sutra Buddhism (Sutrayana).

We can make ""our own Buddha"" (just like how some modern-day Christians make their own ""personal Jesus""), a secular materialist who believed that we should just enjoy the present moment, but what will that benefit us, except to feed our narcissism? Will that end suffering, if our narcissism is one of the reasons we suffer in the first place?

My mother and I met a distant cousin I hadn't talked to for years over dinner tonight.  My mother had mentioned on the way over that he had an interest in eastern religion/philosophy just as myself.  

He said that he was a meditation teacher for 39 years.  I was deeply  humbled and delighted by this.  I hadn't heard of TM before except for the fact that it costed a large sum of money.  I decided to maintain an open mind about it.  However, things were not as they had first appeared.  Whenever our discussion of this subject began, he retorted that all forms of meditation were wrong except for this kind and that I would have to pay a large sum of money for this technique (and I'm his relative).  I picked apart his thesis in my head by asking him deep, probing questions.  His answers were very unskillful and filled with egoistic delusions.  Quite the opposite of an experienced meditation practitioner.

Fortunately, I was able to maintain respect and compassion the whole time.  He doesn't even know I discovered his hoax.  It is a shame that he would try to scam his relatives for money.  I'll have to see if any of my relatives have fallen into his trap.  I think one might have.

It involves a rapid depletion of nervous energy, an abnormal increase of detrimental secretions as for instance that of bile into the stomach.  To the sick man resentment ought to be more strictly forbidden than anything else—it is his particular danger: unfortunately however it is also his most natural inclination.  This was fully grasped by that profound physiologist Buddha.  His ""religion” which it would be better to call a system of hygiene in order to avoid confounding it with a creed so wretched as Christianity depended for its effect upon the triumph over resentment: to make the soul free from this was considered the first step towards recovery.  ""Not by hostility is hostility put to flight; through friendship does hostility end”: this stands at the beginning of Buddha’s teaching—this is not a precept of morality but of physiology.»

«Although a certain amount of superstition and poetry is mingled therein these propositions are true!  A step further and the gods were cast aside—which Europe likewise will have to do before very long!  One more step further and priests and intermediaries could also be dispensed with—and then Buddha the teacher of the religion of self-redemption appeared.  How far Europe is still removed from this degree of culture!» 

«Buddha says: ""Do not flatter your benefactor!"". Let one repeat this saying in a Christian church : it immediately purifies the air of everything Christian.»

«For this remains as I have already pointed out the essential difference between the two religions of decadence : Buddhism promises nothing, but actually fulfils; Christianity promises everything, but fulfils nothing.»

If there were no taints, there'd never be personality or a being, seemingly separate from everything. If there was only pure enlightenment, there'd be no duality, there'd be no good and bad, no sense or nonsense, no real and unreal, no will nor no-will.

But how could everything become something that it's not? It can't, and thus, we can't stop being Buddha-Nature. Everything can't stop being everything. Infinite can't stop being infinite. So everything is illusorily divided by the power of itself, because it contains both parts of it, and thus by containing both parts, it can create and uncreate.

Why is it illusory? Because everything will never stop being everything.

Can a drop of water in the ocean say ""I'm more water than all the other drops""? It can't. If a drop of water wanted to dry another drop of water, could it do it? No, it couldn't. Thus, there's no real destruction, nor a real individual.

We are like drops of water in the sea. But that division is not the ultimate nature of reality, it doesn't mean we can't perceive it as real. Until we understand the whole universe, we will be equally affected by this, and we should consider it as real; not being foolish and disregarding things.

Taints give rise to our personality, our characteristics and our being. We can't become pure with attachment to our taints. How could an attached person to itself become one with everything if he refuses to let go of himself? That is the division he creates between he and the universe; not imposed by anyone but himself.

But if a drop ceased it's illusory boundaries with the rest of the water, would that mean the drop ceased to exist? Would that mean there's an empty space where the drop used to be? Would it mean that the drop in the bottom is the same drop than on the top? No, it wouldn't.

I have been studying Buddhism for a while, and I love it dearly. The two author's books that I've been reading most frequently are Alan Watts and Thich Nhat Hanh. But to the point - 

I've become so apathetic to things. I no longer have any opinions on anything subjective, so to speak. For example, with friends - if we're walking through a busy street and we see a woman shouting curse words, my friend will say ""Wow. Is she aware of how idiotic she looks?"" and I won't reply. Because my reply is always the same. ""Perhaps she's just having a really bad day.""

When written, this makes me just sound *humble*, but it is a problem. I don't ever really smile or laugh. Or get angry or cry. I don't really feel anything. I've been reading Buddhism books swiftly and with great interest, and integrating parts into my life. I feel like existence is so clear to me. I used to get existential depression often, however I haven't had it since I've been studying Buddhism.

Although I feel like I've become a more understanding person, and a lot calmer, I feel apathy now. I struggle to think of more examples of my apathy, but another one I guess would be if, while gaming, my girlfriend accidentally kills me (and it was the only life I had remaining). She says ""Sorry sorry sorry"" and I just say ""No problem. It's okay! It was an accident.""

This probably sounds like rambling now, but I had to say it. Does anyone else feel a certain sense of apathy?

I didn't like the colour scheme and the bottom wasn't done properly. Resizing wasn't working and I found a bunch of artifacts... so I remade the whole thing in MS paint.

I was raised Christian my whole life and accepted Christianity with little question. This past winter break I have been looking into other religious and Buddhism stood out to me. I realized that I could no longer accept Christianity as the truth and started my own spiritual journey.

Fast forward to yesterday. I am in Home Depot getting a light for my Lava Lamp and I see this Monk checking out. I wait until he is outside and introduce myself. I tell him my story and that I am still new to the life of the Buddhist. He tells me that he owns a Monastery near by (There is actually 2) and that we would teach me the art of Meditation as well as educate me in the way of the Buddha. He gave me the number to the place and invited me to their meetings. 

I am so thankful for a teacher like him and I am looking forward to what he has to teach me. I am excited to start learning from him and developing my inner Buddha through education and meditation. 

TL;DR: Just accepted the Buddhist lifestyle, met a Monk in HD, invited me to his Monastery to tech me how to Meditate and learn.

Question: They meet every other Sunday at the Monastery at 6pm. Is this a usual meeting time for Buddhists?

This subreddit is growing constantly and I'm very happy to see this. This means many people got to hear about Buddhism, some way or another. I'm happy because Buddhism has brought many good things to my life, and empowered me to bring many good things to the ones I get to know, so I'm hoping it will do the same to your life, no matter how small the improvement is.

Here are some FAQ that I hope can save you some time and keep you from some misdirections/misconceptions, have fun!:

---

**What is Buddhism and who can call himself a buddhist?**

Buddhism is following the buddha's teachings, no matter if Buddha taught them to you or not. It's no religion or philosophy, it's just life. You can call yourself a buddhist if you follow or try to follow the Buddha's teachings. There's no initiation or ceremony needed. It's a free to join club and you can be an atheist, an agnostic, a christian, a mormon or any religion and also be buddhist. You don't need to worship anyone.

**Why are there monks?**

Monks are disciples who vowed to follow Buddha's teachings. The difference to any other person (per se) is the vows that they take, which means they have made a commitment to the Buddha's teachings (read: buddhism). The monks exist because it's the best way for the teachings to survive and be transmitted. This is because only a human can successfully communicate and teach to another human. Relying on a book or any other stiff object or product means some things can and will get lost in the transmission. Think of it like being with a person can't be replaced by seeing a photo, video or a writing of him.

**Do I need to/Should I aim to become a monk if I practice Buddhism?**

No. You can practice without this aim. Choosing to become a monk is like buying your house, you buy it because you like it, because you want it, because you know exactly what you are buying and because you know you can live happily there. Don't do it if you ""have heard"" that it's ""the right thing"" or if you think it's the only way to archive peace, or any other unrealistic view.

**What is meditation and what can I do with it?**

Meditation is focusing the mind in a chosen task. For example, you can meditate (read: focus your mind) in analyzing your memories and discovering things about yourself, or you can meditate to analyze your concepts and beliefs to discover fallacies or get to new conclusions... or you can meditate on relaxing your body to get relieved from stress and pain... or you can meditate in many other things to get different results. In short, you can focus your mind in anything you chose, as long as you always focus your mind. Meditation is work. In a broader Buddhist context (or in different Buddhist practices), this could be any kind of spiritual cultivation (*bhavana*).


**How many kinds of meditations there are?**

There are literary thousands of kinds of meditations with all short of aims of which here in west we only get to know a very small bunch. Most of them are taught in Asia by people who spend all their life studying meditation very seriously, like in here we have PhD's. In west might seem like a new age or recent thing, but it's actually very far developed.


**What is samsara?**

Samsara is an Indian term that can be described as ""suffering"". Suffering in this context doesn't exactly translate to pain, since pain can be enjoyed. Suffering (samsara) is just being unhappy with something, no matter if it's a pleasant, unpleasant or neutral sensation. In a strict sense, samsara is the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.

**Do I have to become vegetarian to be a Buddhist?**

No. Only if you want to, understand why and agree to do so. Many buddhists are vegetarian tho.


**What is enlightenment?**

Enlightenment is a process in which a practitioner gains consciousness, going from levels of low consciousness (ignorance) to higher consciousness (wisdom). It's more practical to see it as a continual process rather than a ""just once"" occurrence. The higher the consciousness the freer the practitioner is. To ""attain full enlightenment"" means the practitioner has become totally free and is fully conscious of minds true nature. Only when archiving this one can justly say one choses his own path and is truthfully free.

**What's Dharma?**

Dharma is the things the way they are. To understand Dharma is to have a flawless understanding of the true nature of things. It's a tough topic, which gets understood with practice and gaining awareness/consciousness. Don't worry if you don't get it.

**What are attachments and what's ""getting rid of attachments""?**

Attachments is a term that describes something that troubles us because we are holding on to it and we aren't willing to let go. It's an unconscious act.

Contrary to what many people think, ""getting rid of attachments"" doesn't mean not doing things (for example, not loving, not wanting, not crying, etc.). What ""not having attachments"" means is that even tho you might want something, you won't allow it (what you want) to cloud your mind and/or prevent you from doing the right thing (your duties, your obligations, your responsibilities).

To get rid of an attachment you must first become aware of it, in it's true form.


**What is Karma?**

Karma is a term used to describe a synergy or negative synergy that our acts create and how it relates with other's synergy or negative synergy. **Karma is not a form of ""an eye for an eye"", this is a misunderstanding that has been widely spread**. It works more like sound waves. People's actions transform into waves when they do them and the effect of it is spread thru them, others and things. Some waves increase certain other waves, some others decrease them, some other cause interference or nullification (of positive or negative acts), and everyone interacts with other people's waves in different ways.  Some waves are big, some waves are small. This can also be a tough topic, don't worry if you don't get it.


**What is a ""buddha"" and what is ""the Buddha"" and what's the difference?**

A ""buddha"" is a term to describe any person who reaches enlightenment. ""The Buddha"" refers to Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, and the first recognized Buddha. A ""buddha"" can be a buddha without knowing he's a buddha, because he practices the Buddha's teachings, even tho he doesn't know or doesn't recognize them as the Buddha's teachings. This is, for example, like we don't needing someone to explain us what speaking is for us to begin speaking.

**Do Buddhist worship Buddha?**
No. A Buddha is not a god. A Buddha and the Buddha are teachers who we offer our respect and memory, but they also become symbols of enlightenment and wisdom. Guanyin for example became a buddhist symbol of compassion.

In many traditions, when buddhists need to have something to chant or an image to adorn something, instead of placing something meaningless, they place a buddha's image, which also helps them to remind the Buddha's teachings.


**What is a ""koan""?**

A koan is a term used to describe a puzzle a teacher gives to a buddhism student in order for him to introspect and meditate until he has acquired an specific understanding. This teaching is the key to make the koan understandable.


**What am I supposed to do in Buddhism?**

In buddhism you are invited to think, to strive for great wisdom, to be energetic, to enjoy life, to be happy, to respect others, to listen, **to ask**, to care, to have certainty, to have confidence, to contradict others, to be inquisitive, to doubt, to construct, to leave your status quo/comfort zone, to become comfortable with being uncomfortable, to welcome change, to welcome not change, to follow your common sense, to interiorize, to exteriorize. In short: to be free and care for others.

**What am I not supposed to do in Buddhism?**

You are not invited to: harm others, disrespect, do things without purpose/thinking, over think things, ""complicate your existence"" or others', take things too seriously -including yourself-, to censure, to have fear of doing what you think it's right even tho it contradicts what I or someone told you, or even the Buddha.

**Some things to remember**

- Buddhism is about being happy and **being true to yourself**. If you are suffering, maybe you understood something wrong.

- Being true to yourself doesn't mean making excuses to not do or change things.

- Always feel free to ask.

- Don't worry too much if you don't get something.

- If you get stuck, analyze your current line of thought. Maybe you are giving something for granted.

- Don't mind too much what others tell you; no more than your own opinion. Just always fundament your own opinion, or else it's just egotism.

- Like in any other thing, there are many fake ways and fake teachers. Watch out.

- If you get to understand something don't be preachy. It's not in Buddha's teachings.

- It's ok and normal to feel sad, happy, envious, angry, irritated, excited, etc. Just as long as it doesn't distract you from being conscious and you don't dwell on it.

Thanks for reading, hope it was of use to you. Feel free to contribute with your questions and thoughts! I'd also like to clarify that these questions and answers are taken from a Zen/Chán/Mahayana point of view.

1304846082.0,125,self.Buddhism,h6lio,I'm a Shaolin monk's disciple AMA,,148,23,224,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/h6lio/im_a_shaolin_monks_disciple_ama/,"Hello reddit,
I'm a Shaolin's warrior monk disciple, soon to be ordained a warrior monk too, and I've seen there are a lot of doubts and questions about Buddhism every now and then in here, which most are not clearly answered. **I would like to help with any question you have regarding Buddhism or meditation, its' history or interpretations of various concepts or stories.**

We practice Chan (zen) Buddhism, which is the kind of Buddhism practiced at the monastery. There's a lot of content in the Internet about Zen and Buddhism but none too clarifying about it really (specially in non-asian languages), and it's not that Zen it's meant to be unintelligible, but rather that it takes a shift in one's understanding which, specially at it's earliest levels, can not be conveyed by words. It's like trying to show a blue flower to someone with red colored eye glasses... Until he reaches them and takes them off, he will see the blue flower as black.

I will set some subjects, feel free to ask me about it, question me or dialogue them with me.

-----

- Anyway first off, I would like to clarify that Zen is buddhism, as also kung fu is buddhism. All has a meaning and a reason, no concept it's there magically or arbitrarily.

- Second, I would like to clarify that the goal of all kinds of Buddhism is enlightenment and the achievement of happiness. What happiness and enlightenment is, is another matter.

- Third, I have seen than it's a common practice that many start with meditation from a book or the internet. This is not necessarily bad, but it's like trying to learn to swim in your bathtub; it might be good, but it most surely won't prepare you to swim in the sea. Also there are many fake teachers or teachers who have not the truthful knowledge, thus their knowledge will only span more confusion.

- Fourth, when I say Chan from now on you should read it as Chan Buddhism (or Zen buddhism, as it's known in Japan).

- Fifth, meditation is work, work brings enlightenment, without work a meditation is just relaxation, thus, it won't bring enlightenment.

- Sixth, Chan is a way which focuses on the mind leading everything else, including the body. Other kinds of buddhism walk other paths. If you are interested in Chan, you are in for one of a lot of hard work, both mental AND physical.

- Seventh, Chan is confusing but it's not meant to be eternally confusing. You see koans and stories that are hard to understand, but those are meant to be taught by a master to a disciple, and those are meant to be said to specific persons, with specific problems and at specific times.

- Eighth, it's better to not to practice something from anything, not only form Chan, if you don't fully understand it, than to practice it within confusion. Riding a car might get you faster to where you want to go, but if you don't know how to drive it, it might even get you injured or others.

- Ninth, Buddhism is puzzling everywhere for many reasons but the biggest one is: we really live in a world where thinking about obvious things is stupid, thus, we give them for granted, and then later we wonder why we don't understand the world. The further you go in Chan, the more you amaze of how simple the world is, and how complicated we make it for ourselves and others.

- Tenth, meditation doesn't end with ""feelings"". In fact meditation doesn't end. But, if I must say anything about meditation, it is that it must be based on mindful work. The meditative postures and breathing and focus of the mind will relax the body and mind, but this is just the start, and to give you an honest comparison, it's like giving 1 step in a marathon. As a master once said ""One must correct the body, then correct the breathing. After this, one can begin to correct the mind"", and the mind requires a lot more work than just breathing and having a good posture.

- Eleventh, to put it in mundane words, when one has enlightenment it's like when one realizes who the killer was in the movie. It's not just a feeling, but's accompanied with knowledge and a new perception. This might not sound mystical like most texts and quotes you will find, but it's not less truthful.

- Twelfth, Chan won't solve your problems nor it's a way of escaping them. Chan will help you solve them and realize how to do it, but in the end, the one who must solve them is you. And it doesn't matter who your teacher is, you have to be there to face your life alone. You can solve your problems with Chan, or without it. Chan is just another road to the same goal we all have: happiness.

------

Anyway I think I set many good subjects here, feel free to question me in anything about this or ask me some new things. Maybe something about the story of Bodhidarma, Sidhartha, Shaolin, or any other thing. I would rather not go much into details about my background since i don't think it maters, because no matter who my shifu is, it won't make my words more or less truthful. Thus, they must be truthful to you, or else you won't agree with them.  Also I don't want you guys to think I'm doing this for promotion, as it happens with many fake monks. But if you want to go there, we can talk about it.

We think about this glass not as being dirty, but as having dirt. If the glass were dirty by nature, we would throw it out, as the dirt and glass would be inseparable. But this is not the case. There is only dirt on an otherwise pure glass. 

We must not perceive ourselves as inherently ignorant, hateful, jealous, or greedy. These are just dirt particles. Know that you can cleanse yourself of these, just as the glass that comes out sparkling from the dishwasher.

And better yet, in our cases, there isn't even real dirt. There is only the construct of dirt; the illusion of dirt we trick ourselves into seeing and believing. It's beautiful.

    Once wealth is accumulated,
    Family and household life may follow.

    By dividing wealth into four parts,
    True friendships are bound;
    One part should be enjoyed;
    Two parts invested in business;
    And the fourth set aside
    Against future misfortunes.

1359145929.0,119,self.Buddhism,179x0w,"All suffering, fears, worries and anxieties, like nightmares, are based on irrationality and falsity no matter how real they feel and seem. If you know this, you can overcome them.",pinchitony,142,23,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/179x0w/all_suffering_fears_worries_and_anxieties_like/,"Said in other way: we tend to see things in exaggerated fashion.

Our reality perception is bent and uncalibrated. Some times we diminish value to things that have more value (being centred, calm, peace, wellbeing, focus, concentration), and we overpower things that have no value (worries, anxieties, distractions, etc.).

Stress, fear as well as exaggerated joy or hate and all extremes of emotions and feelings, are caused by irrationalities or falsity. Seeing something greater, smaller more or less important that it is.

We must know that the fact that we feel something doesn't meant it actually is that. That we think something doesn't mean it actually is that. That we think we don't know something doesn't meant we actually don't know it. That we don't see something doesn't mean we aren't seeing it.

We have to be aware that what we *think* or seems it is sometimes it isn't. And sometimes it is. So we must calibrate our discernment throughout observation.

Sometimes the answer is as simple as: Why I can't have an answer to this? Because the question is wrongly formulated.

Why can't I understand this? Because it's incongruent, like trying to divide between 0.

We have to be aware that in the exam of meditation, 'no answer' or 'whatever' some times is the correct answer, since not all the questions we ask are rightly formulated. Like asking 'how many water carries the color orange?'. It's just nonsense. Imagine obsessing with answering such nonsensical question!! That's indeed suffering. And that we do with many things which we don't notice.

We have to remember that there are layers and there's not only consciousness-reality interacting. But that reality is: Consciousness &gt; mental formations &gt; Perception &gt; Sensation &gt; Form &gt; Consciousness again, and so on. They all affect each other and feedback between them.

So summing it up, all the times what we worry, fear, and are anxious about is unrealistic. Like when we thought there's a monster under our bed. Then we realised we had actually never seen one in our life, just thought we had.

Losing someone, pain, death, incarceration, torture, etc. Aren't that bad. I have endured days without eating, and very hard pains myself both emotionally and physically (and those who don't think so, I'd invite you to go train with a Shaolin monk :P ).

The only way something is bad is if we suffer from it, and the only way we can suffer from anything is by attaching ourselves to falsity and irrationality; and that can make even the very good things be bad, how more so the 'bad' things which we see as bad.

If you make a little rewind of your memory, you can see that you have felt pain and loss and committed mistakes through all of your life, and not all the times you suffered from it, in fact, most of the times you didn't even care or noticed about it.

Remember when you were a kid and you got hurt and your parents got sickly worried but you didn't even noticed. Remember when you squished a bug and didn't care. Remember when a member of the family died which you didn't actually knew and you were puzzled as to why everyone else was so sad. All those things, are in essence, the same loss and pain you have felt; are the same colours displayed in different arrangements. Except since you didn't give it that much importance, you didn't felt it as bad.

This doesn't mean we should be careless and heartless, since it's very different to do something innocently or naively, than do it with the explicit intent to harm. But it's a pointer to something very useful: That things, happenings and actions are not inherently related to suffering! Nor anything else.

You can pretty much do anything in life without suffering if you are genuinely good in the heart or genuinely want to be good in the heart.

Hope this was of good use.",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,,True,t3_179x0w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/179x0w/all_suffering_fears_worries_and_anxieties_like/,

In order for the sun to shine, you only need to remove anything covering it.

That's why when you understand something you feel and describe your mind as ""clearer"", and when you get deep into falsehood you can't focus, your mind gets dirt on it (falsity), and thus it ""isn't clear"".

Ignorance is created, truth and wisdom is not created, and thus is not subject to death and rebirth.

We create ignorance by unconscious and prolonged attachment to falsehood.

Work diligently to lose ignorance, not to gain wisdom.

As stated by Ven. Gautama, enlightenment is not bright enlightenment. The light of the tathagata doesn't need any light, thus there's no ""bright enlightenment"". Defilement actually comes into being for adding light to enlightenment to make it bright.

It seems, in my humble opion, that there are those coming to this forum saying that certain drugs have provided them mindfulness or that other drugs are leading to enlightenment. Often, if the discussion actually does take a Dharma tone, the original poster rarely responds to these answers. They do, on the other hand respond to the anecdotal stories that read ""Yeah, I'm Buddhist too, but I still burn one."" Why do they not respond to the Dharma answer? In my opinion, they often don't like the truth they are confronted with or they posted in /r/buddhism when in reality they wanted to post in /r/mentaltechnologies (not that this exists), /r/meditation, or /r/trees. 

I think our teachers, regardless of tradition, would look at these questions and laugh. It seems there is a rather well grounded response to the question of drugs and Dharma, that being, they don't mix well. They are an obstruction like any other. I have yet to read an teaching, either in the Pali or in my own traditions writings where it is ever indicated that drug usage is complatible with a Dharmic practice. If I am wrong about this, I would appreciate more information, be it from a valid source, not an anecdotal story. 

It seems odd that people who do indulge come here looking for some spiritual ""meaning"" to the feeling of being high. There isn't one. It is an illusion, a poison to your clear mind. The more we give watered down answers to these questions or keep upvoting them, the less this seems like /r/buddhism  and the more it seems like /r/please_help_me_justify_my_drug_usage. I come here for a Dharma community, upvoting the drug questions about how Dharma can help them detach from the poison of addiction is one thing. To justify it's basis or simply be overly nice about it waters down the truth of the matter: The precepts are pretty clear, the teachings are not very obstructed in this message. 

I understand all will not agree with my position, we are Buddhists afterall (j/k). But after these recent posts and seeing a lot of people confusing a simple meditation lifestyle with being Buddhist, I think we need to keep /r/buddhism on task as a Dharma community and not a new age, feel good party.
I would also like to point out that I post to many different Buddhist forums, interact with my local Sangha's when I can, and I have yet to ever see the question of drugs come up this often. Drugs are not going to give you instant enlightenment, mindfulness on a headful of crap isn't really mindfulness.

**edit:**  I think this conversation has been very insightful. I would like to mention that beyond just the personal usage issue, the suffering caused by distribution has been raised. I think it shows how multifaceted this is really is from a Buddhist perspective.

**edit 2:** I get the sense that some of our Psychonaut guests want to espouse the benefit of LSD and other psychoactive drugs, but I have to ask, why do so many of you state ""I am not a Buddhist"" or ""I don't practice Dharma."" I believe that is how we have been framing this question. This is not a blanket statement to *all* the psychonauts, so don't jump on me saying I'm generalizing.",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,True,,,True,t3_naz6m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/naz6m/the_drug_questions/,

a week or so ago there was a post about Shaolin monks in which I replied. Some people asked me to do an AMA, so here it is.

A bit about my background: I've been practicing gong fu for 5 years now, chán buddhism for about 3 (at least in this life). I've experience in taiji quan, wushu, sanda, chi gong, taolu and some traditional weapons like sword, spear and staff. My longest still meditation has been for about an hour and a half. I've also practiced some dream meditations and stayed fully consciously thru the process of dreaming. I've also spent some days in the mountains near my city with my master doing chán practices.

A bit about my life: I live in México with my master, we both work, plus we teach in our school. I live a normal life in many aspects, I eat meat, I go out with friends and drink when invited to and I smoke from time to time. I don't do illegal drugs tho, nor think about doing it. I haven't taken any vows regarding any of the previously mentioned things and I center my practice in learning from every experience. When I quit doing something is because I fully understood why I was doing it and what attracted me about it; in this way I learn about my attachments and I become freer from them.

A bit about my lineage: I'm 34th generation in Shaolin, my shifu is 33th and his shifu 31th; the jump is because my shifu is from the 2nd generation from that master. My master is Shi Long Yun, he's trained gong fu all his life and he stayed training 1 year in Shaolin with Shifu Sheng He, a bikshu (or Bhikkhu) monk.

I had already done one AMA and I think this is a good opportunity for me and some of you who remember the previous one to see what has changed and what has stayed the same.

I hope you can learn from this as much as I will do and feel free to ask me about any subject. If I had anything to say about buddhism is that buddhism is as open and broad as life itself and there's nothing about our own lives we should feel attached to, even to feeling shame about something we did or do.

I know that I'm not supposed to shake his hand (unless he shakes mine), but beyond that, I'm kind of lost.  Googling this kind of thing doesn't really help, because some of the websites are contradictory, and many deal more with having him as your teacher, as opposed to just meeting him for five minutes when you're still sweaty and tired for a full day of work.

I ended up with a very unique surprise.  I'm running late trying to hurry as fast as possible so I can make the beginning of the ceremony. I haphazardly enter into the primary room where our session is about to begin.

The typical crowd was there:  That one old person who snores during Vipassana, a few randoms, the really stressed straight-edge business man, the joyous monks, and overly-spiritual post menopausal lady were all present.  However, there was someone different.  An additional orange robe was chilling out in the corner.  Who was this elder monk?  Why did he give me a weird vibe?

The traditional service began as usual.  I thought nothing much of this foreign character; I barely even had a view of him from my vantage point.  As the session continued, one of the resident monks explained he journeyed from afar to be present for the Katina ceremony in a few days.  We have had other monks visit before.  This sort of thing was no big deal.

Towards the end of our whole session, the elder monk ran our Dharma talk with a brief lecture and a Q&amp;A while our group maintained a typical discussion.

He was an overwhelmingly plain character.  All of the resident monks and any skilled practitioner could have answered questions better than him.  His Dharma talk was extremely simple.  Nothing about him was special except for one thing that was very subtle.

His mental state was *astounding.*  The untrained might think he was just a goofy, happy monk.  For a person who has met many monks you were just able to tell that he stood apart from them.  His smile was sheer ecstasy.  All you had to do was look at him once.  He was grooving with the whole damn universe.  His presence was unreal.

I tried to listen to his Dharma talk.  I really did.  His answers weren't articulated very well due to language barriers and the poor questioners seemed confused at his answers.  They must have thought he was a mediocre monk.  If I was new I probably would have too.  I stopped paying attention to all the words he said and watched his body language, emotional state, and mannerisms in awe.  They were strangely similar to [Shunryu Suzuki.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHNyCAJXUXE) Unfortunately, I don't know of any other comparisons to give.  If a person could love life as he did, for just a moment, they would be ready to die.  

The service ended.  People were getting up and clearing out.  It was at this moment I realized I could meet him.  Now was my chance!  Then I realized, what the hell would I even say?  He was *too* plain.  It was almost annoying, even.  His personality and intelligence were normal.  His ability to answer questions was kind of redundant and simplistic.  He didn't stand out at all.  Yet at the very same time, when you looked closer at a very subtle level, his level of mental ecstasy and spiritual wholeness were simply magical.

The Dharma he found wasn't through words and the Dharma I witnessed wasn't through them either.  He wasn't trying to be present.  He wasn't acting or pretending to be holier than thou.  He was just in his natural state. I thanked him for visiting my center and smiled.  That was all.  No question I would have asked would have done an ounce of justice.  Nothing else was needed.  There was nothing else to say. I just went on doing my thing and he did too.

1363794416.0,94,self.Buddhism,1ao274,The Buddha on what living alone really means ,numbersev,110,16,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1ao274/the_buddha_on_what_living_alone_really_means/,"On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' sanctuary. Now at that time a certain monk by the name of Elder[1] was one who lived alone and extolled the virtues of living alone. Alone he entered the village for alms, alone he returned, alone he sat withdrawn [in meditation], alone he did walking meditation.

Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they informed him: ""Lord, there is a certain monk by the name of Elder who lives alone and extols the virtues of living alone.""

Then the Blessed One told a certain monk, ""Come, monk. In my name, call the monk named Elder, saying, 'The Teacher calls you, my friend.'""

""As you say, lord,"" the monk answered and, having gone to Ven. Elder, on arrival he said, ""The Teacher calls you, my friend.""

""As you say, my friend,"" Ven. Elder replied. Then he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, ""Is it true, Elder, that you live alone and extol the virtues of living alone?""

""Yes, lord.""

""But how do you live alone and extol the virtues of living alone?""

""Lord, alone I enter the village for alms, alone I return, alone I sit withdrawn [in meditation], alone I do walking meditation. That is how I live alone and extol the virtues of living alone.""

""There is that way of living alone, Elder. I don't say that there isn't. Still, listen well to how your living alone is perfected in its details, and pay close attention. I will speak.""

""As you say, lord,"" Ven. Elder responded.

The Blessed One said: ""And how is living alone perfected in its details? There is the case where whatever is past is abandoned, whatever is future is relinquished, and any passion &amp; desire with regard to states of being attained in the present is well subdued.[2] That is how living alone is perfected in its details.""

That is what the Blessed One said. Having said it, the One Well-gone further said this:


""All-conquering,
all-knowing, intelligent;
with regard to all things,
	unadhering;
all-abandoning,
released in the ending of craving:
*him* I call
a man who lives
			alone.""

At times it seems there is not even enough time to breathe mindfully.,TamSanh,110,15,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/y78bu/thich_nhat_hanh_on_how_do_you_maintain/,"This is not a personal problem only; this is a problem of the whole civilization. That is why we have to practice not only as individuals;we have to practice as a society. We have to make a revolution in the way we organize our society and our daily life, so we will be able to enjoy the work we do every day.
 
Meanwhile, we can incorporate a number of things that we have learned in this retreat in order to lessen our stress. When you drive around the city and come to a red light or a stop sign, you can just sit back and make use of these twenty or thirty seconds to relax-to breathe in, breathe out, and enjoy arriving in the present moment. There are many things like that we can do. Years ago I was in Montreal on the way to a retreat, and I noticed that the license plates said Je me souviens-""I remember."" I did not know what they wanted to remember, but to me it means that I remember to breathe and to smile (laughter). So I told a friend who was driving the car that I had a gift for the sangha in Montreal: every time you see Je me souviens, you remember to breathe and smile and go back to the present moment. Many of our friends in the Montreal sangha have been practicing that for more than ten years.
 
I think we can enjoy the red light; we can also enjoy the stop sign. Every time we see it we profit: instead of being angry at the red light, of being burned by impatience, we just practice breathing in, breathing out, smiling.That helps a lot. And when you hear the telephone ringing you can consider it to be the sound of the mindfulness bell. You practice telephone meditation. Every time you hear the telephone ringing you stay exactly where you are (laughter). You breathe in and breathe out and enjoy your breathing. Listen, listen-this wonderful sound brings you back to your true home. Then when you hear the second ring you stand up and you go to the telephone with dignity (laughter). That means in the style of walking meditation (laughter). You know that you can afford to do that, because if the other person has something really important to tell you, she will not hang up before the third ring. That is what we call telephone meditation. We use the sound as the bell of mindfulness.
 
And waiting at the bus stop you might like to try mindful breathing, and waiting in line to go into a bank, you can always practice mindful breathing. Walking from one building to another building, why don't you use walking meditation, because that improves the quality of our life. That brings more peace and serenity, and the quality of the work we do will be improved just by that kind of practice. So it is possible to integrate the practice into our daily life. We just need a little bit of creative imagination to do so.",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,,True,t3_y78bu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/y78bu/thich_nhat_hanh_on_how_do_you_maintain/,

It thinks that it is being attacked and then thinks that the only way to defend itself is to ward off the threat by showing an aggressive attitude. However, when one experiences a threat that seems to come from outside—whether it is illness, some undesirable experience in the world, or literal opponents—the only way to develop a balanced state of being is not to try to get rid of those things. Instead, one must understand them and make use of them. This leads one to the concept of nonviolence, the opposite of ego’s game. To develop the nonviolent approach, first of all you have to see that your problems are not really trying to destroy you.*

This survey has been created as an attempt to compile information on the various religious beliefs, and lack thereof, on Reddit. Please answer all questions with sincerity and honesty. Please note, this is not a quick ""check one and done"" survey and may take a little while to complete. Also, I have NOT included topics like abortion and homosexuality for a reason. Please do not bring them up in this survey's topic. We are collecting opinions on spirituality, not attempting to fire up yet another debate.

Please upvote this survey so that more data can be collected. This is a self post, so I'm not getting any karma. But we get the best results when many, many people take the survey.

It was on an air force base and the pay was excellent.  However being there for 6 years I trained a lot of people since I was, at one point, the most veteran member of my department.  I had a lot of problems in these situations, because I outranked a lot of my 30-40 year old peers.  And a 37 year old wife working part-time isnt really going to take orders from an 18 year old kid.  They werent even orders, it was just me reading what my boss left for me to do on a list.

This caused a lot of strain with my coworkers.

I left for about 10 months to go work in a call center for DirecTV.  In that time I found out that I enjoyed helping people more than I had cared to obeying the rules set before me.  When I left DTV for personal reasons, I returned to my true home, the grocery store in 2010.  When I had returned there was a lot of drama about me and a 32 year old female coworker having an affair (a rumor she started saying my 10 month leave was because of her feeling threatened) and it put me on the defensive for most of my time there.  As this was the only job that would pay me enough to survive, I had to power through despite the fact that a sexual harassment blemish on my record at 19 would ruin my life.

One day during the 2011 November holiday prep, we were loading our shelves with all the special holiday items.  The Ziploc bags with the trees and reindeer, the gingerbread scented candles, and the hygiene bundle packages of AXE.  This year like all the rest we had box sets of perfume and cologne from Tim McGraw, Beyonce, and Halle Berry, I think even Tony Stewart through his name in the ring there.  They had bars of soap, face wash, and a small bottle of cologne all for a great bargain.  My friend and I silently joked about Tim McGraw and Halle Berry's perfume when a few weeks it happened.

I was restocking some of the shelves and making room on our holiday aisle when a woman came up to Halle Berry's perfume.  She picked it up, sniffed it, checked the price, and put it in her cart; very typical process.  But I stopped for a second and looked at that.  The genius of it all.  I was so awestruck by it.  It finally occurred to me that someone, somewhere is going to get that perfume, maybe a little girl, and she is going to be **ecstatic** to get it.  It didnt have to be a 200 dollar cologne, it didnt have to be anything more, but shes going to get that perfume, and shes going to wear it to school and feel like a million bucks.

I went and sat down in the office and thought about it.  I thought about all the dumb jokes I made about those colognes and people buying those things for their kids and themselves and I felt terrible.  Those cheap eyeliners and mascaras at the grocery store, the toys at thrift shops, everything.. it all meant something to someone.  I was so happy for everyone.  Everyone who was buying groceries to make dinner for their families.  Everyone who was buying perfume for their daughters for Christmas.

 To clarify, I am in the reserves, have and never intend on going to war (unless we are speaking of humanitarian help in regards to a environmental catastrophe). I need the army to pay for school and live.

I've grown from my training, during the hardest times I would be reading ""the art of happiness"". So I took something that could have turned me into someone aggressive, and turned it around for the best. Although I say that, I find it hard to fight all the anger and negative emotions within the army, and I can honestly say that it poisons me. 
I am compassionate, and calm, but my military background remains a dark passenger within me. 

I have very strong mixed feelings about the whole ordeal. I am asking for a new outlook, just help in general. I am compassionate, I want to love, and I want to help others. And although the army helped me grow, I find it is slowly poisoning me. I am a hundred percent sure that I can turn this suffering into something positive, healthy that could help me grow. But I am having a lot of trouble now. 

I would love to hear your feedback, positive or negative, and recommended readings please!

TL;DR I am in the army, I need help staying human. 

EDIT: I can say in all honesty that I invite all criticism with an open mind, but keep in mind that strong aggression towards me without claim will bring us nowhere.

A warrior is not demotivated by confrontation, in fact she/he's fed by it, he gets energy from it because he knows that it's what keeps him anew. The warrior doesn't deny his weakness, thus he doesn't dwell on them, but acts upon them; from this he gets all his strength, turning weaknesses into strengths.

Confront yourself, every day, don't wait until others do it for you, do not avoid such confrontation. Have the humility to recognise your defects, but the strength to work them out.

In my personal case:

Yes, I'm stubborn, lazy, harsh, narrow minded, picky, explosive, lonesome, I some times smoke and I some times drink, I don't do as much for others as I should, I fail a lot, I am disordered, I don't deliver my work on time most of the time, I don't train as often as I should and I also have many other bad things and habits. But I have a lot of virtues too, and I will always use my virtues to overcome all of my vices!

There are lots of good, bad, and ""in between"" books out there. It can be helpful to read a mix of academic books written for the general reader, texts written for a popular audience by Buddhists like the Dalai Lama or Thich Nhat Hanh, and canonical texts.

First, here are a few academic works to get you started. In general, academic writing on religion strives for a ""just the facts"" approach, which can be helpful in establishing a basic understanding. Let's call this category, ""teaching, but not preaching"":

Buddhism in Practice: (Abridged Edition) (Princeton Readings in Religions)

The Story of Buddhism: A Concise Guide to Its History &amp; Teachings
The Foundations of Buddhism (Opus)

Sayings of the Buddha: New Translations from the Pali Nikayas (Oxford World's Classics)

The Buddha: A Beginner's Guide (Beginners Guide (Oneworld))

Buddhist Scriptures (Penguin Classics)


Here are a few books written by Buddhists, for Buddhists (or just the general reader). This category can be more difficult to navigate through. Sometimes you encounter fake teachers, self-help ""gurus"", or other people wanting to package what they are selling in the label 'Buddhism'. Here I have picked a few books that are written by reliable and well known Buddhist teachers. These books are light, readable, and convey the teachings of a tradition in a very open way. Let's call this category, ""preaching and teaching"":

The Art of Happiness, 10th Anniversary Edition: A Handbook for Living

The Universe in a Single Atom: The Convergence of Science and Spirituality

Orthodox Chinese Buddhism: A Contemporary Chan Master's Answers to Common Questions

Buddhism of the Heart: Reflections on Shin Buddhism and Inner Togetherness

River of Fire, River of Water

Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind

Old Path White Clouds: Walking in the Footsteps of the Buddha

The Noble Eightfold Path: Way to the End of Suffering


Another way to approach Buddhism is to read canonical texts. These texts should be read with an open and patient mind. Reading scripture is different than reading history or literature, so take your time and enjoy. The Lotus Sutra is especially known for its parables. The Dhammapada is especially known for its short aphorisms regarding key Buddhist principles. This category includes recent (and thus hopefully better) translations of Buddhist texts:

In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)

The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the 

Majjhima Nikaya (Teachings of the Buddha)

The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the 

Samyutta Nikaya

The Long Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Digha Nikaya (Teachings of the Buddha)

The Lotus Sutra (BDK English Tripitaka)

The Three Pure Land Sutras (Bdk English Tripitaka Translation Series)

A Comprehensive Commentary on the Heart Sutra (Bdk English 
Tripitaka Translation Series)

The Sutra of Queen Srimala of the Lion's Roar and the Vimalakirti Sutra (Bdk English Tripitaka Translation Series)


And finally, once you have worked your way through the books above, and you still want more, here are a few more advanced academic works in Buddhist Studies. These books cover up-to-date information on various topics including: the history of the academic study of Buddhism, Buddhism in the West, the rise of the Mahayana, Indian Buddhism, and Chan/Son/Zen Buddhism. Here I have included works that will assist you in deepening your knowledge of Buddhist history (more will be added later):

Curators of the Buddha: The Study of Buddhism under Colonialism

The Making of Buddhist Modernism

Bones, Stones, and Buddhist Monks: Collected Papers on the Archaeology, Epigraphy, and Texts of Monastic Buddhism in India (Studies in the Buddhist Traditions)

Buddhist Monks and Business Matters: Still More Papers on Monastic Buddhism in India (Studies in the Buddhist Traditions)

Figments and Fragments of Mahayana Buddhism in India: More Collected Papers (Studies in the Buddhist Traditions)

Chan Insights and Oversights

Seeing through Zen: Encounter, Transformation, and Genealogy in Chinese Chan Buddhism (Philip E. Lilienthal Book in Asian Studies)

A Few Good Men (Studies in the Buddhist Traditions)

Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West


I hope that this list will be useful on the one hand to scholars in other areas of religious or Asian studies, and on the other hand Buddhists hoping to get a clear understanding of the history and doctrines of the Buddhist tradition. For those interested in studying in a more academic sense, dig deep into the works of the scholars I have presented. If you are interested in learning about Buddhist practice, then get off the internet, and go find a teacher! ;-)

One reason was a ""be sure this is what you really really want"" kind of argument, which I really understand. But a lot of it seemed to come from an almost financial point of view. I saw comments that it was hard to be a monk in other countries, extremely expensive and even ""a foolish decision"".

-As Buddhists, shouldn't the monastic life be something we respect? Regardless of the ""depth"" of your belief. I'm an extremely secular Buddhist, on top of being a Zen practitioner, but I still respect and admire the monastics. 

-Why is it so expensive to be a monk? Yes you'd have to get wherever  you're going and pay of debts, but aside from that...isn't one of the points of being a monk that you don't have money (in the Theravada tradition I'm pretty sure the vinaya forbids handling money all together)

-Why is it harder to be a Monk in other countries as an American? Is that just general backlash from the community (don't give alms to the foreigner?)

Thanks for the talk guys! 

**Edit:** Thanks for discussing with me guys. I just want to say that I don't think any of you wanted to do anything other than give help to our friend.

One of the most important philosophical insights in Buddhism comes from what is known as the theory of emptiness. At its heart is the deep recognition that there is a fundamental disparity between the way we perceive the world, including our own experience in it, and the way things actually are.

In our day-to-day experience, we tend to relate to the world and to ourselves as if these entities possessed self-enclosed, definable, discrete and enduring reality. For instance, if we examine our own conception of selfhood, we will find that we tend to believe in the presence of an essential core to our being, which characterises our individuality and identity as a discrete ego, independent of the physical and mental elements that constitute our existence.

The philosophy of emptiness reveals that this is not only a fundamental error but also the basis for attachment, clinging and the development of our numerous prejudices. According to the theory of emptiness, any belief in an objective reality grounded in the assumption of intrinsic, independent existence is simply untenable. All things and events, whether ‘material’, mental or even abstract concepts like time, are devoid of objective, independent existence.

To intrinsically possess such independent existence would imply that all things and events are somehow complete unto themselves and are therefore entirely self-contained. This would mean that nothing has the capacity to interact with or exert influence on any other phenomena. But we know that there is cause and effect – turn a key in a car, the starter motor turns the engine over, spark plugs ignite and fuel begins to burn… Yet in a universe of self-contained, inherently existing things, these events could never occur!

So effectively, the notion of intrinsic existence is incompatible with causation; this is because causation implies contingency and dependence, while anything that inherently existed would be immutable and self-enclosed. In the theory of emptiness, everything is argued as merely being composed of dependently related events; of continuously interacting phenomena with no fixed, immutable essence, which are themselves in dynamic and constantly changing relations. Thus, things and events are 'empty' in that they can never possess any immutable essence, intrinsic reality or absolute ‘being’ that affords independence.",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,,True,t3_svcga,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/svcga/the_dalai_lama_on_emptiness/,

First time posting on this subreddit and I have never had a one-2-one conversation with a Buddhist (spoke briefly with one on r/debatereligion but that's about it)

I dont know as much as I would like to about the Buddhist religion but from what I do know, it's incredible.
The spiritual side of it all, meditation, everything along those lines makes me wonder what that kind of life would be.

It has been a dream of mine to one day visit Tibet and discover all the wonders that await there.

Anyway my question to you people is, what do you think of the state of humanity? When you look at the world with all it's problems and complications, are you optimistic that one day we, the human race will learn to live in peace?

Like I said, I know nothing about your faith so forgive me not doing my research before posting, but I would love to know all that you could tell me.

Thank you for your time in reading this.

Several people came to me and expressed sentiments like ""he was suffering, maybe it was better this way"". I soon wanted to tell them they had likely suffered more than my dad had. Yes, he lived through many, many health problems, and was in various kinds of pain for a very long time. His illnesses ranged from excruciating to annoying, sharply painful to achy and even to plain uncomfortable most of the time. None of these people even realized all the surgeries, treatments, medications, and health conditions he bore. None of them would've been able to list off what he went through.

However, Dad greeted each day thankful for the sunrise. He never complained about his problems, and always listened patiently and supportively when others complained. He never dwelled on his problems, was always kind to the nurses and doctors, and was well known for his friendliness, joyfullness, and helpfulness. He never wished his life was over, but he accepted death would come and faced it without fear. 

I'm still working on non-attachment but I feel lifted by my dad's own courage and *lack* of suffering. He lived many principles of the eightfold path, though he didn't know of it. ",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,,True,t3_e36p1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/e36p1/on_suffering/,

I'll lend you a secret. It's the secret of ultimate happiness.

My ultimate secret for happiness is this: *Nothing in the world makes me happy.*

That's right, nothing. Not things, not family, not relationships, not entertainment, not playing, not action, not inaction, not sex, not drugs, not health, not helping others, not money, not success, not myself, not my ideas, not my wants, not my memories, not my expectations, not my emotions, not my body, not life, not anything, nothing at all.

You know why? Because my happiness doesn't depend on any of those things! My happiness can't be traced to any particular thing in the world because I know that the moment I put my happiness on anything in this world that moment my happiness can be shattered.

When I put my happiness in my health, when I get sick I feel sad. When I put my happiness in my success, when I don't succeed I feel bad. When I put my happiness in someone else, when that person doesn't do what I want or is ill or dies, I feel bad. When I put my happiness in love, when I don't feel loved I feel bad, and so on!

So I don't place my happiness on anything! And that makes me very happy with everything and lets me really enjoy things!

Isn't it funny how that works?

Is that simple. And there's no better person in the world that someone who is truthfully happy, so your ethics and morals also get corrected just by being happy, because you have no reason to demand, or take from anyone and make anyone unhappy, because you don't need anything. Only when a heart lacks or needs something from this world can make evil deeds, because delusion and ignorance is the root of all evils!

So I hope you realise that nothing in this world makes you happy :)

If you can learn and handle the meaning of this, you won't ever need a single thing in life again and you'll be for ever free.

Take care.",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,,True,t3_17hj97,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/17hj97/nothing_in_the_world_makes_me_happy/,

I just wanted to talk about feeling loneliness and the buddhist perspective on it. 

Like I said, I kinda feel all alone in the world. And I'm not talking about dating or anything specifically, I just mean in general, I feel pretty lonely. I don't stay indoors all day, and I interact with people on a 
daily basis. I've got friends and people to talk to but I don't feel like...I don't feel ""connected"" to anyone. 

Actually, if I have a choice, I prefer being alone over hanging out with other people. But I don't understand why I feel lonely. Sometimes I'm okay with it. Or sometimes I'll be talking to my friends and they'll talk about how they went to a party, or how they did this, or that - and I start feeling lonely again. I don't know why. I like being alone and on my own, but at the same time I feel lonely? I don't know if I'm getting my point across though - I've just been feeling more and more isolated these days. 

I like being alone and on my own but I don't like feeling lonely? Any advice? Anyone who's been through this? Also, what's the buddhist perspective on loneliness and being alone? Thanks. :)

EDIT: Wow! Thanks so much for the replies guys! I'll be going through them one by one. :)

EDIT #2: Thank you so much guys, thanks to *everyone* who commented. I've got a lot to think about now, you guys really got me thinking. I couldn't have gotten this far without you. One thing that's surprised me is that there are other people who're in the same position as me. I hope the comments will be helpful to you as they were to me. Thanks again everyone.

Throughout my childhood (about  10 years old and on) I had experienced and intense amount of suffering.  By the time I was 13 or 14 I was unhappy all the time.  Happiness had seemed to have disappeared.  My depression worsened even more at the age of 16.  My mother had me start seeing a psychologist.  He diagnosed me with the disorder known as Anhedondia [characterized by the inability to experience joy from normal activities though to be from dopamine and other chemicals not being released in the brain].  I slowly improved a little bit and left my psychologist.  In my late 16th year I discovered Buddhism and began to study its ideas and teachings.  This summer, at my current age, I still hadn't experienced happiness.  It had been years.   However, through meditation and learning of the mind I greatly reduced suffering to the point where it doesn't really exist inside me anymore.  This left me with a state of emotional blankness and neutrality for months.  It was better than being unhappy, but it was still very empty.  Yesterday night, alone at my house, I was stricken with a piercing amount of sorrow for no apparent reason.  It was the same intense feeling I had in the suicidal days of my earlier youth.  I didn’t know what was happening and the past was engulfing me.  It was the worst feeling I had ever felt, as if all of the terrible experiences I had came together.   
Moments after this sorrow had appeared I had a realization.  I had said to myself that “I” was suffering again.  There was an ""I"" that had been said!  I remembered that my emotions did not define who I am and sough to be free from them.  So I began to sit in meditation with the intention of separating the ego and emotions from myself that had been tormenting me for years.   My mind felt very clear and when I was sitting time seemed to have stopped.  It felt like I was watching my thoughts from the outside in.  Letting them go.  Suddenly, like the flip of a switch, all of the sadness just disappeared like a ripple of a wave running through the ocean.   I was left with joy and happiness that I hadn’t experienced in years and a smile on my face that I had long forgotten.  The happiness has stayed.  I can’t explain any of this, but I really wanted to tell all of you.  Many someday I’ll understand it.

You were intelligent and eloquent enough to know what the world was.  Maybe it became to much. Maybe the understanding became a waterlogged weight. 

You were a beautiful person. Your eyes were greener then the park you loved and your hair was a waterfall of curls. A smile never left your face, often I wondered if your cheeks hurt.

I dressed in white and went to your grave, because you always admired that dress. I brought incense and my statue of Buddha, a bouquet of hand picked daisies from your green eye park. It rained but the incense lit fine, and there was your ukulele, I played the songs you taught me. My fingers slipped a few times but I was able to play the melody and I knew the words and I meant them feverishly:
 
*You were born in a bottle rocket in 1929, as your spirit left your body, how it split the sky.*

Tears left my eyes as I spoke to you, this one last time, and I know you could hear me.

We should have been closer, I realize that now; in some ways I regret it and others I do not. But at the same time we were. I will not forget the plans we made. The promises of seeing that band in concert, the promises of a day spent at the Garden of the 1000 Buddhas. I will do these things and more, in your name, with your light in my eyes.

Because you never belonged here, Carolyn, I know that now. You were crystal and glass, solid air with a human face. You are now  the clouds. You are the beautiful clouds that soar and sing in their own little dance, and I will always remember the day we danced together.

You are gone from this life and into another. I will never forget you.

He saw a large log being carried along by the current near the bank of the river Ganges, and on seeing it said to the monks: ""Monks, do you see that large log being carried along by the current of the river Ganges?""

""Yes, lord.""

""Monks, if that log doesn't veer toward the near shore, doesn't veer toward the far shore, doesn't sink in the middle, doesn't get washed up on high ground, doesn't get snared by human beings, doesn't get snared by non-human beings, doesn't get snared in a whirlpool, and doesn't become rotten inside, it will tend to the ocean, tilt to the ocean, incline to the ocean. Why is that? Because the current of the river Ganges tends to the ocean, tilts to the ocean, inclines to the ocean.

""In the same way, monks, if you don't veer toward the near shore, don't veer toward the far shore, don't sink in the middle, don't get washed up on high ground, don't get snared by human beings, don't get snared by non-human beings, don't get snared in a whirlpool, and don't become rotten inside, you will tend to Unbinding, tilt to Unbinding, incline to Unbinding. Why is that? Because right view tends to Unbinding, tilts to Unbinding, inclines to Unbinding.""

When this was said, a certain monk addressed the Blessed One: ""What, lord, is the near shore? What is the far shore? What is sinking in the middle? What is being washed up on high ground? What is being snared by human beings? What is being snared by non-human beings? What is being snared by a whirlpool? What is becoming rotten inside?""

""'The near shore,' monks, stands for the six internal sense media. 'The far shore' stands for the six external sense media. 'Sinking in the middle' stands for passion &amp; delight. 'Being washed up on high ground' stands for the conceit, 'I am.'

""And what, monks, is being snared by human beings? There is the case where a monk lives entangled with householders, delighting with them and sorrowing with them, happy when they are happy, pained when they are in pain, taking on their affairs as his own duty. This is called being snared by human beings.

""And what, monks, is being snared by non-human beings? There is the case where a certain monk lives the holy life in hopes of a certain company of devas, [thinking,] 'By means of this virtue or practice or austerity or holy life I will become one sort of deva or another.' This is called being snared by non-human beings.

""'Being snared by a whirlpool' stands for the five strings of sensuality.

"" And what, monks, is becoming rotten inside? There is the case where a certain monk is unprincipled, evil, unclean and suspect in his undertakings, hidden in his actions, not a contemplative though claiming to be one, not leading the holy life though claiming to do so, inwardly rotten, oozing with desire, filthy by nature.

ORIGINAL POST:
------------
I've practiced meditation daily for 45 years -- 1 1/2 to 3 hrs a day actually 'missing' maybe 10 days. Began as a very yogically based practice, (LONG before there were any yoga asana classes in the States); this was pure practice based in the fundamental yogic tradition of Patanjali. I studied and lived closely with a teacher for 6 years or so, then on my own but still in regular touch for years following. I later shifted my orientation to a Buddhist approach, which I maintain to this day. I've probably visited this board only 5 or 6 times since noticing it a year(?) or so ago. There are things that a simple, daily, disciplined practice make clear over time that, ideally, working closely with a conscientious teacher would clear up immediately. I'm not a scholar, and make no claims to anything other than a prolonged and somewhat disciplined approach to practice, but if there were some basic assurances or 'angles' on sitting that I might be able to share with someone, with anyone, who was sincerely working with these things and didn't even have anyone to simply bounce a basic question off of, I'd be glad to sit for a couple of hours and respond.
Again, I want to make it clear that I'm not a scholar, not 'looking for students, and was really raised up in the tradition of practice to 'work hard and shut up' about it. I.e., it's not something that I normally broadcast.
Anyway .. I just did some answering of questions on another sub/r about working with Bruce Lee several years ago and it occurred to me after that what working with him really led me to was not furthering in martial arts but, rather, into an exploration of working with body and mind vis-a-vis a traditional yogic meditation practice and that THAT is really something that might be of value to someone younger and interested. So, thought I'd ask if this sounded like anything that might be of value to anyone here. I wouldn't see it as ""me telling you what's up"" .. but I thought it could be done as a little sort of round table discussion sort of thing, though it would be based in my background I guess. I'll check back .. if it looks like it might, then I'll set a time or something. If not .. thanks for your consideration of it.

**Edit** - This little outing has really driven home to me the difficulty of beginning practice -- it had been so long for me .. so long ago since I wrestled with those issues .. that I had grown anesthetized to them.  In a few hours I will write a direct response to questions from here, and from what I notice on the Meditation sub-red, having to do with early practice and how to wrestle with proceeding.  Should have done this earlier I now think.

**Edit-2** So I just added a long piece down the page a ways .. with ""PRACTICE .. PRACTICE .. PRACTICE .. "" along the top and then another as a conclusion to it, underneath the first. My sense at this point is that they'll be lost by the Reddit system of 'burying' everything in a day or two. Hopefully, someone may see it and may take SOMEthing from it that they may eventually discover some value in.  
Thanks again.

My point is, it's easy to say *'they're idiots'* and go on with your life, looking down on them. It's a lot harder to feel their suffering. I mean, under the right circumstances (sickness, money problems, relationship problems, etc), anyone might seek help or an escape in the form of some radical belief. Then how would you feel when everything turns out to be a lie? What problems would you face if you threw away your future, believing the world would end?

A lot of people on Reddit love the nasty comments and insults towards these doomsday believers but I disagree that this is helpful in any way. If anything, it only creates more distance and separation between ''us'' and ''them''. In my opinion, this dualistic vision is just as 'wrong' as the dualistic vision of those radical Christians. The fact that people are laughing and joking about it means that they don't feel the suffering of these people.

I don't really have any friends right now. That is, I have human contact, I go to work, but I don't do anything outside of work with other humans. I feel distant and separated from everyone.

Which is strange, because in Buddhist thought we're all ultimately without separation or self, dependent origination, etc. So how can I feel separated? Yet I do, because the brain of any social animal compels them to seek contact with others. So that's an inescapable skandha, right, so I just need to make sure I'm not attached to it?

Then there's that quote everyone loves to toss around, the one about the rhino. ""Be as the rhino and walk alone unless you find someone worth walking with."" But we're also told to practice compassion and understanding, and if you're not having contact with other people because you're walking alone, how are you exercising compassion?

I tried going to the Buddhist temple for a while to find some sort of community or belonging in a social sense. I feel stupid for it, because it's just another form of clinging, right? Anyway, the temple didn't bring me anything, as dukkha inhabits all things. Not sure what I expected.

What do I think will change if I have friends or if I talk to people? Possibly being a hermit is a good thing.

But there's something else that gives rise to a thought that violently rejects that notion. No, being a hermit cannot be a good thing, I must be social, I must know people, but how?

It is like grasping at smoke, or placing your shadow in a jar. There is nothing there. Only the ebbs and flows of forever changing emotions, thoughts and perceptions.

There is no MetaMaxx experiencing reality, only the universe experiencing me. We all come from the same source. The actual source is irrelevant because we are here. Right now. Out of this understanding of the lack of an actual self comes great compassion. We are all the same emptiness existing in a shared experience. 

The ego is nothing but an illusion we build up out of ignorance and fear of the unknown. Taking refuge in the teachings relinquishes the ignorance, which in turn relinquishes the fear. Out of the clearing that comes forth, out of the emptiness, we find a great empathy.

1362666638.0,79,self.Buddhism,19uge3,The refuge of no refuge,SergioDuBois,87,8,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/19uge3/the_refuge_of_no_refuge/,"""The first, or outer, level of refuge is Buddha, Dharma, Sangha; in Tibetan, **sang-gyé**, **chö**, **gen-dün**. 

**Sang-gyé** (""buddha"") means complete, open wakefulness. Usually if I am looking for refuge, I go to a smaller, darker place: I go home, I go to bed, I close the door and I go to sleep; and I lock it all out. This is not what is meant by refuge in Buddhism. Buddhism is always *the refuge of no-refuge*. Sang-gyé, complete open wakefulness, is different from this idea. It is *complete*. Refuge is not complete because it is refuge from something. This is the refuge of no-refuge; it is complete. It is open – it is not closed. And it is wakeful – it is not hiding in some way. Sang-gyé kyab-su ché: *I establish confidence in the actuality of complete, open wakefulness*. I usually translate refuge in this way – refuge is the establishment of confidence in the actuality of something. Buddha here is not the founder of the religion, or some kind of god. Buddha is what we are, what we can realise ourselves to be – this complete, open wakefulness. Buddha kyab-su ché: I establish confidence in the actuality of that – that I have some glimpse of that, I am inspired by that, something touches me both emotionally and intellectually about that. I have researched this thing; so I have real confidence that is not based upon wish-fulfilment or projection.

Then there is **chö**, or Dharma. Chö is *as-it-is* – not as I wish it was, as I would like it to be, as it ought to be – *as-it-is*. This is also the refuge of no-refuge; because I cannot say I do not like how it is and I want my money back. This is not a philosophy; this is not something created by anybody, even though people have written about it. No one who ever writes about it owns it; apart from owning it in their being. Dharma—as-it-is— we can discover how it is. This is why Shakyamuni Buddha said: You must not accept my words simply because I am saying them. You have to check these words out; you have to test them. The analogy was to test them like the goldsmith tests gold – by rubbing and burnishing and doing all the tests you can to prove that this is what it is. One has to prove it within one’s own *experience*. That is what is meant by chö. Chö is *not* something to be believed; chö is something to be *discovered*. Here one has to have the courage and openness to accept that what one discovers one might not like. I might not be comfortable with the reality I find in this; it might threaten me in some way. But somehow I am not going to retreat from that and create a cosier version of reality that makes me comfortable. Chö is having one’s nose pressed hard up against the reality of what is there. 

Then there is **gen-dün**, sangha. This is an interesting one – taking refuge in sangha – because quite often sangha really are the refuge of no-refuge. If we are confronted with a collection of back-biting, back-stabbing, gossiping individuals, then certainly there is no refuge there. Maybe in the West we have the best possible kind of sangha already; I do not know. I have often had sad perspectives on how Buddhists are with each other in the West. There seems to be a high level of neurosis in which people seem to be there for many different reasons; and often it does not seem to be about becoming more open as an individual. It seems to be about joining a club, being part of something where there is an in-group and an out-group where people are excluded and there are people to talk about. Obviously no refuge is offered there; it is really the refuge of no-refuge if it is like this. What is meant here is that sangha are people who are *changing*. These are people who are *practising*; therefore, they are empty people. Usually the definition of a friend is he or she who backs me up in my neurosis: I tell you about the person I have some problem with, and we both sit down and say: ‘Yes – asshole!’ This is how friends usually operate; but this is not necessarily how sangha operates. Sangha are people who are changing; their neuroses should not have such a tight bind on them as they used to have. If we live in a world where we meet sangha members, and one finds that: ‘Hmmm, he or she used to react in this way; and they don’t seem to be doing that any more,’ that is threatening. I think that sangha members feel that they have to give each other gratuitous spiritual advice. This is not what is meant by sangha, either. The only way that sangha members can authentically threaten each other is by being real practitioners. One does not have to make any comment whatsoever on anybody else. It is not even that one does not back one’s friends in the sangha up in their neuroses; it is that one is simply different about it. One does not say: ‘Oh, you should not be having those feelings.’ When one says: ‘That guy is an asshole.’ You say: ‘Maybe, yeah, but then – there are other things too.’ It is not that one has to be puritanical about that, and be ‘holy’ in some way. One is manifesting some compassion, and one ought to be able to resonate to some degree with someone’s view, even though one might not hold that view so seriously any more. A real sangha member would come from the point of view of partial support – in terms of being with this person in what they are feeling, but not really shoring it up and fuelling it. When we are with people like this, it is a little bit *irritating* really; because we really know that their position is a good position. We know what we want from them, and we know that we are not getting it quite as much as we would like; we know we also have no complaint about that, because we would not really want it to be any other way. That is irritating. This is completely destroyed when another sangha member tries to point out to you that you are not being a good Buddhist – because when one is criticised, one simply entrenches. Then one cannot hear or see anything; and this is really useless.

*This is important.* This is the functioning of compassion. When one can see someone being really irritated and angry with someone else, the best thing to do is not to say: ‘Oh, you shouldn’t be feeling like this; this is not a good Buddhist thing to feel.’ You can say: ‘Yeah, I can see why you’re irritated.’ You have to resonate a little bit; otherwise you are cut off from this person. You cannot say: ‘I don’t have such feelings.’ All you can say is: ‘Yes, I have them; but I try not to take them too seriously, because that’s not going to help in the end.’ This is refuge of no-refuge, because there is no refuge for our neurosis here. This is what is called the outer refuge.""

Vegetarianism is something I've been thinking about recently. I'm currently not a vegetarian, and while learning and practicing Buddhism, I've essentially justified my actions by telling myself that the Buddha allowed eating meat (as long as it wasn't killed explicitly for you). 

However, last night I was sitting in a group meeting, discussing Right Livelihood. It seems clear to me that a job that consists of killing and butchering animals would not be considered Right Livelihood. So the question I've been asking myself recently is: ""Is it a Right Action to eat meat when it so clearly puts someone else in the position of Wrong Livelihood?""

Last night I brought this up in our discussion, and the woman leading us described the circumstances around the Buddha’s time when he accepted eating meat. At that time, the monks were dependant on the surrounding villagers to provide them with food. As such, the Buddha told them not to turn down meat if that was what was being served in that household, because that would require them to go out of their way to provide something above and beyond what they had already prepared (and also potentially offends someone who is being gracious). It’s the “beggers can’t be choosers” paradigm. Vegetarianism, in that sense, is somewhat of a double edge sword. While it takes the animals lives who are living beings, it also negatively impacts those who are kind enough to prepare us food. The magnitude of the respective harm is certainly something to consider, but we all know the Buddha’s stance on the middle way. 

Things have changed today. We no longer have family farmers who are raising their animals in open pastures who have a relatively good life before their lives are taken. And the farmers or butchers who needed to take the lives of the animals likely did not have had to do that in a mass production setting, where taking the lives of animals was their main occupation. The inhumane treatment of animals on factory farms adds another dimension to the moral issue.

As a result of all this thinking, I think of the fact that the Buddha allowed eating meat as more of an artifact of the current culture (edit: the culture of his day, not today's) rather than a guiding principle. I’m personally going to reduce my meat intake. I’m not going to call myself a vegetarian, because I don’t want to concern the people who may be serving food (I’m thinking of when my dad finds his grill this spring) to find something else for me to eat. I will eat it and feel thankful for the animal whose life was taken to sustain mine. But when the choice is mine, I will try to stick to not eating meat. 

How do you think the Buddha would act in today's food environment?

1367764092.0,78,self.Buddhism,1dqd1g,I seek understanding --- My friend is using Buddhism to argue that African children will no longer starve if everyone perceives them not starving.,Hearkon,101,23,208,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1dqd1g/i_seek_understanding_my_friend_is_using_buddhism/,"My friend told me that my desire to save the world (make it better by developing solutions for the problems we face), is a limiting belief. This was the conversation:

Buddhist Friend: It implies that the world needs saving, and when you speak something like that into existence, it unfolds in a butterfly effect of becoming that. The world like does need to be saved because you have the mindset that it's like trash, like it sucks, ""I need to fix it, I need to save it, it's broken"". It's just introducing negative ideas into the world, where you could instead stay completely positive and say, ""The world is beautiful, the world is fucking beautiful. I'm going to live my life and have everything be a reflection of me saying that life is perfect. Everything is happening as it should be. Everything is perfect."" When Gandhi says, ""Be the change you wish to see in the world."" That's first talking about what's going on in your own head. Like you can't fix the external until you work on the internal. It's all a reflection in that way. Whatever's going on inside, that's what you see outside. So when you do the inner work, you turn everything positive, because you can do that. You can go in and flip the switch on every single idea in your brain and turn it positive. Then the next step after that is to not only make things positive, but to get rid of anything that has any kind of lowering vibrational effect, which is a limiting belief of any kind, such as ""The world needs to be fixed"", which implies that it is broken.

Me: I would like to question something. To all the starving children in Africa, would you be willing to tell them that the world is not broken? I feel like you're blissfully ignorant. I perceive that because you say that this is my reality and I will make it how I want, that you are intentionally choosing not to see what's wrong with the world.

Buddhist Friend: **The only reason children are starving in Africa, is because every single day people are telling them that there are starving children in Africa.** If they would just adopt positive beliefs, which we can share, which Buddhism has shared and changed so many people's lives, is that if you change your thoughts, the world will change (people will no longer starve if everyone perceives them not starving).

1343565691.0,71,self.Buddhism,xc8tt,Something 'clicked' in my mind - I'm beginning to get why I suffer.,herpified,85,14,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/xc8tt/something_clicked_in_my_mind_im_beginning_to_get/,"Hello, my e-sangha.

For the past week, I've been meditating daily for two hours, watching [BuddhistSocietyWA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe4gks2rAGg&amp;feature=plcp) dharmma talks, and re-reading Mindfulness in Plain English. 

The result?

A small, but significant, insight into suffering.
 
I'm posting this for myself (helps to write these types of things out) and for any others who could find it beneficial. Many of these ideas have been presented in other works of literature - the content is not exactly new but the presentation (at least in my opinion) is more suitable for a beginner such as myself.

Anyways, here's the gist of the matter - a large portion of suffering is caused by thinking.

Thoughts, ideas, stories, opinions... are usually not positive. More often than not, these mental proliferations cause stress and problems in one’s life.

Ex:
'I'm not good-looking enough.'

'Why does that dog never shut-up?'

'Gonna be late to work, again. Fuck me.’

‘What the hell am I doing with my life?’

All this internal commentary inspires some very unwholesome states of mind: greed, jealousy, anger, lust, and sloth.

Worse, because of the obsessive nature of thinking, these concepts will take over your mind and consciousness. They enslave you, trapping the mind in an endless cycle of ruminations.  

Ironically, thoughts do not accurately reflect reality. Some parts are overemphasized, other parts are ignored. Actions are exaggerated, past events are misremembered.

There’s a reason that judges don’t blindly trust eyewitness accounts of crimes: the human mind is extraordinarily fallible, capable of creating the most elaborate illusions and fantasies out of thin air.

All of the mental clutter in your mind serves only to create a barrier between you and reality. It, in the words of Henepola Gunaratana, makes you “feel insulated from the sweetness of experience by some sort of sensory cotton.”

This “sensory cotton” is what fuels the suffering caused by craving. 

The thoughts inside our minds sell us on the notion that happiness can be found outside of ourselves. What is the result of this fallacy? Quoting again from Mindfulness in Plain English: “We get stuck in the 'If only' syndrome. If only I had more money, then I would be happy. If only I could find somebody who really loves me, if only I could lose 20 pounds, if only I had a color TV, Jacuzzi, and curly hair, and on and on forever”

That if only reality were to change to fit our expectations, we would be at peace. 

So we grasp the fire and scream, dancing in the frenzy of sensual pleasure. More, more, more. It is never enough. We stick needles into our arms, stuff cake down our throats, watch the orgy of sex and violence on the television... but the hole within ourselves is not filled. The tension is not gone. Happiness has not been achieved. The struggle against reality remains.
 
Is there a solution? Is there a way out of this trap? 

In a word, meditation.

Breath by breath, you gradually transform your way of perceiving the world. From a reality based on illusions to a reality based on the experience of the present moment. With every session of zazen, the mind becomes more quiet and still. Peace makes way for happiness. Happiness invites equanimity. Equanimity fosters dispassion.

No longer are you slave to your mind’s passions. Be free, my little latka. =)

tl;dr - thoughts cause stress/doubt + distort reality + prevent you from recognizing grasping/rejecting complex as the major cause of suffering. drop the thoughts/illusions, they don’t add much to your life and cause lots of pain. don’t stress out about thoughts either - this is a decade-long process. think less, meditate more. learn to perceive the world non-conceptually. in time, you will prefer it.",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,,True,t3_xc8tt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/xc8tt/something_clicked_in_my_mind_im_beginning_to_get/,

Reflect on this quietly. A dragon's pearl may be found. An enormous jewel may be acquired. But this one day out of a hundred years cannot be retrieved once it is lost. What skillful means can retrieve a day that is passed? No historical documents have recorded any such means. Not to waste time is to contain the passage of days and months within your skin bag, without leaking. Thus, sages and wise ones in olden times valued each moment, day, and month more thain their own eyeballs or the nation's land. To waste the passage of time is to be confused and stained in the floating world of name and gain. Not to miss the passage of time is to be in the way for the way.

""Once you have clarity, do not neglect a single day. Wholeheartedly practice for the sake of the way and speak for the sake of the way. We know that buddha ancestors of old did not neglect each day's endeavor. You should reflect on this every day. Sit near a bright window and reflect on this, on mellow and flower-filled days. Why do the moments of time steal your endeavor? They not only steal one day but steal the merit of many kalpas. What kind of enemy is the passage of time? How regettable! Your loss of time is all down to your negligence of practice. If you were not intimate with yourself you would resent yourself.""

I was very emotional about my beliefs and values, about the people in my life and the things that were important to me. I stood up for myself and the people around me. I'd get angry during debates and yell. I was very outspoken and hard-headed. 

Now not so much. Since I started practicing, I've become very ""meh"" about things that I used to be very passionate about. My emotions have gone from intense and uncontrollable to almost non-existent. Now while I'm thankful for my ability to let things be and my awareness of impermanence (because I really was an emotional wreck before), I kind of miss the passion. I miss the spark I used to have, and so do other people. My mother recently said to me ""You're a different person. Nothing bothers you anymore."" She meant it as a compliment, of course, but it was kind of bittersweet. There's a part of me that feels like I'm ""meh""ing my way through life right now because I don't see the purpose in getting riled up about anything, even the stuff I used to find so important. It's kind of depressing.

I'll be retiring from reddit now for a while. I learned many things from you, hope you learned many things from me.

I'll be preparing for my trip to Shaolin, which will be next year. Those of you interested in going please keep using my mail to communicate with me, my mail is redshaolinmonk@gmail.com. We'll keep in touch there. If anyone asks, please give them this email.

I'll be erasing the account tomorrow to eliminate any temptation, so if you need to save any link or comment save it now.

I'll leave you a message for each one of you to meditate until next time we see each other, hope it helps you with something:

**To those who still have problems with christianity or other religions: **

Someone who has never been a prisoner sees a ball and chain and sees what he has heard of balls and chains. A recently freed prisoner sees a ball and chain and trembles, wanting to get as far from it as possible.

But a long freed prisoner who is not afraid anymore sees a ball and chain and he greets an old friend.

**To those who seek the ultimate truths of the universe: **

When you gaze to the stars the earth gets out of your sight. When you observe the earth, you miss the stars. But when you put your aim in the horizon you see the sky and the earth clearly and beautifully.

**To those who seek relief from their suffering:**

Damo is in hell, enjoying it like heaven. Mara is in heaven, tricking others to think it's worse than hell.

*Damo = Bodhidharma*

**To those who lack motivation:**

Discover or re-discover who you really are. After that no motivation is needed.

**To those who follow Buddhism without a teacher:**

That you have gone far doesn't mean you know the way. That you know the way, doesn't mean that you've gone far. What you want to know is not what you need to know... That's why the master needs to be there with you.

**To those who don't know what to do:**

Remember where you want to go. If you don't know where you want to go, remember where you have been. If you don't want or can't be where you have been, think where you'd like to be. After that just start walking.

---

To everyone in general:

Buddhism is quite easy: If you think too much, stop thinking so much. If you think too few, start thinking more. If you don't know what to think, do what you feel is right. If you don't know what to feel, think what's best. If something is tough, do it until it's easy. If something is too easy, improve it until it's tough. Never keep things to yourself, get them out somehow. Never ignore your problems, face them. Never ignore your anger, fear, sadness, joy, anxiety or stress: face them.

Don't let anyone tell you who you are and what you can do. That's only up to you. And treat others like your family, because we all live in just one world and we all affect it. Your sadness will become my sadness, your joy will become my joy.

But I surely would like to invite you to read this small guide so that you can understand a bit of why it's done, how it's done, and how you can adopt it, after that decide if it's your thing or not.

This post is mainly concerned with the practice as it is (as if you were already a buddhist who took refuge under the three jewels and practicing or had practice with a monk), not addressing other subjects further. There are many misconceptions and mysticism regarding the altars, and I won't be getting into that right now, but I surely will on another post. So please be patient and don't disregard this practice until you have gotten more information about it.

This post is for those who are already following a buddhist tradition yet lack knowledge of how to setup a proper altar.

**Foreword**

An altar above all is a practice of love, of humility, respect, care and of a deep connection with everything that isn't you (the world, the teachers, the teachings). It'll help you grow immensely in your practice and in no way it will harm it or stop it or will make you superstitious or dumb or blind or anything... That unless you are doing something wrong, but the altar is not to blame for that.

An altar is not about getting something but about giving and learning from that. If we want to ask something from the altar we will learn that we must first give, and it's because of this that things will begin to change in our lives.

**What is an altar**

An altar is an special place of practice. It represents the state of our practice. Whatever and however we treat our altar represents directly how we are and what we do. It's a mirror of yourself.

If we don't care much for the altar, it means we don't care much for our practice and development. If we constantly give things to the altar in order to receive benefits, it means we are greedy. If we curse at the altar, it means we are angry at ourselves, if we generously give and sacrifice things we like to the altar, it means we are generous.

Since the altar represents our practice, it also represents our connection with the teachers before us and our gratitude for what they did for us.

From an altar, whatever you give you take. If you give bad, you get bad. If you give good, you get good. If you give nothing, you get nothing. If you give shallow things, you get shallow things. If you hide it, you be insecure, if you honour it you will be honourable, if you respect it you will be respectable. That's how it works.

**Whom will we dedicate the altar to**

An altar is dedicated to a Buddha or teacher we feel an emotional connection with. It can be dedicated to multiple buddhas, or to a single one; that's up to you, but you must dedicate it to them sincerely. Don't add anyone just like adding stuff to your shopping cart. Add Buddhas and teachers that are meaningful to you. 

You might add other teachers that aren't strictly buddhist as Jesus, as long as it's someone who you seriously think was an enlightened teacher. But I really suggest adding at least one Buddha since the imagery of the Buddhas are filled with symbolisms so that they teach with their representation and it will enrich your practice. Also some times mixing your religion with buddhist practice might cause conflict so just don't be reckless or mix things recklessly or forcefully.

Like previously said, what you give is what you take, so the Buddha or teacher you dedicate your altar to will affect the outcome of your practice, so don't do something you regret. Placing a person as a mockery will only harm you and your practice so just watch out for that. 

Here are some lists and images of some Buddhas: [List in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Buddhas), [List of buddhas an their representations in Tsem Tulku Rinpoche website](http://v7.tsemtulku.com/category/resources/buddhas/).

*Wrathful emanations* like Ven. Mahakala, Yamantaka or Vajrayogini, or dakinis are not suggested unless you are a really really advanced practitioner. Even if you feel interest in them, it will very likely harm you instead of help you if you add them, so I won't be getting into that.

If you don't know which buddha to pick I suggest you one or two of these:

- [Budai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budai) if you seek joy and abundance for everyone.

- [Guanyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanyin) if you seek to be compassionate, understanding and helpful to all sentient beings regardless of their state.

- [Shakyamuni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha) if you seek understanding, discipline and science.

- [Amithaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitābha) if you seek transcendence.

- [Bodhidharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma) if you seek power, determination and strength to conquer afflictions.

- [Medicine King](http://www.dharma-haven.org/tibetan/medicine-buddha.htm) if you seek health for you and others, both physically and mentally.

- [White tara](http://www.himalayanart.org/image.cfm/51.html) if you seek your wishes and others fulfilled so we all can be happy.

- [Manjusri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manjusri) if you seek wisdom to guide your life.

- [Ksitigarbha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ksitigarbha) if you want to endure sacrifice in order to help others in seemingly unsurmountable conditions.

**What to offer to the altar**

Both physically and mentally we should offer all desirable things to the altar. What we give is what we get.

Customarily what is given is: Flowers, incense, food (anything that is vegetarian), water, ginseng, precious metals, jewels, silk clothes, etc.

Don't give anything that you wouldn't give a buddhist monk (for example, guns, electronics, etc.).

Play music for it (be it singing or in an audio player), pusas and mantras.

When you decorate your altar, put a nice fabric as a tablecloth, order it nicely, etc.

Things that will rot are left until they rot or decay. For example a flower until it's dry, the same with a fruit.

You should also give postrations and/or recite mantras to the altar.

Adding books and sutras to the altar is also nice as it's adding written mantras and any other offering we can.

**Taking care of the altar**

After it's set up, no one should touch it unless it's greeted first. In temples only monks and disciples might touch an altar... Why? Because it's something personal. It's not something to get angry and mad and passive aggressive for but we should keep things respectful.

To greet the altar we must make three postrations. Here is a [video of a way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obFdpSTsuYw), here [another video of another way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbMFtzTGgkE).

For any interaction (be it that we add, move or remove something) we should greet it first. Also before burning incenses.

When cleaning it, the first thing that's removed is the buddha. Before lifting it, we put both our hands as a cone on top of it, and blow three times to clean it from dust. After that the buddha might be removed and everything else.

**Practice**

An altar should be treated like if it were the teacher itself. So before we practice we should make postrations and/or give incense as possible. You will notice how your practice changes when you are conscious of the altar and the buddhas and when you are not. *It becomes healthier* because it will keep you humble and social, instead of apathetic and conceited, and this will generate much good in your life.

**About incenses**

Incenses are offered in sets of three. One for Buddha, one for Dharma and one for Sangha (if you don't have a sangha, just take it as your family or even this online-community). They are not blown but should be swung up and down until only the embers remain.

Before lit, the incenses are hold with both our hands and with the back of our thumbs we touch our forehead, our mouth and our chest at the level of the heart to offer them to the Buddha, dharma and sangha. This is done three times. After that they can be lit and set.


**What to ask**

We should feel invited to ask for the things we want  in life to the altar since this will help us meditate upon them while asking for them to the altar and buddhas. Altho we must know the basic rule: In order to get, we must give first. We can add pictures of diseased ones to ask for them or we can ask for something we would desire. It's ok, as long as you keep the basic rule.

**edit:** as a note on this, it's important to know that humility is the basis of asking. We shouldn't feel entitled to anything, altho that doesn't mean our work is useless. It just means we can do ALL there's to do and yet not get something... Because that's not up to us to decide, like it's not up to us to decide if someone loves us or not after everything. Yet that also doesn't mean we shouldn't try it and give all our best, because if we don't we will surely never get it.

Aaanyway, this post turned quite longer than I expected. I hope this is helpful and it's by no means a definitive guide to it. I'll try to expand on it later, but feel free to ask questions.

The post covers most of the customary cares of the altar, but I'd like to make another post on the mental and emotional development the altar help us make. I'll try to post it another day. Also I'd like to add another post to cover common misconceptions and mysticisms about keeping an altar, but it's quite a long subject. I hope you can wait until then.

It's normal to not be able to control something, even within ourselves. Don't despair if you find you can't control yourself or the situation. We all face this every now and then.

Another funny thing is that by focusing on keeping control when you actually don't have it you can't see the actions that would actually give you control, at least, over yourself.

Wash this, wash that, rinse this, spread that. You get it. You probably do it too. It's autopilot. Maybe you always put one shoe on before the other. What is it that you do in this way? Without thought? Here is my  challenge to you: STOP IT. Just once. When you catch yourself, change it. If I always wash my left arm first, because I'm right handed, I'll stop and wash anything else. You know what my mind thinks of that? It thinks it's fun. It gets a jolt of the happy. Awareness has a way of doing that.

I can slow down the wild anxiety train/snowball, if you will, using my own willpower and mindfulness. This is something that I would always tell myself is what I should do, but I now have figured out how to actually put in to practice. My symptoms were really that of Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  My friend suggested that I tell him what the worries are as they occur to me, and he'll tell me how much it seems that they are grounded in reality. The more this is repeated, the more I will get better at recognizing the gradients of value and importance in my anxious thoughts on my own. I will also practice on my own, but it will help at first to have a non-judgmental third party to call me out.

It helps me to articulate this and maybe even get feedback, and I remembered that there was a Buddhism subreddit, so that's why I came here. 
Really it's related to an idea that fits with Buddhism but is almost a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy application.  

I read the entire book ""Buddhism on the Couch,""  which involved just this subject of the combination of Buddhism and psychotherapy.

So thanks for the ability to share this!  It's like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders!  (Another expression that I always hear, but really understand what it's describing right now.)  

Everybody have a good day/night/some hours. :)

Edit:  I want to mention another very important part of this discovery.  It almost seems counter-intuitive, but the key thing that it takes is humility and sacrificing pride.  And it can be the most difficult thing.  Is this what is meant by giving up the ego?  In that case I might just now be realizing what is meant by that also.  It takes humility in order to recognize that all thoughts you have might not be right, and might not be based in reality.

I'm not a scientist or a buddhist, so don't accuse me of failing to be either. I'm writing this to organize my thoughts, and then sharing it to hear criticism so I don't develop a feedback loop. I'm not stating this as truth. I'm developing confidence in the Buddha's teachings and I want to know if this is a wrong view.

Lets pretend for a moment that the atoms that make up my body are changed every year. I have had just over 23 bodies in my lifetime. The flame on a candle burns on account of the wax and wick. If you changed the wax and the wick, would it be the same flame? No. The oxidation arises from the reactions between those elements and energy. From these 23 bodies, I have had 23 consciousnesses.

The actions I took in my first body have a direct impact on the formation of my second body. I nourished my body with foods of my choosing, exercised the mind with texts I preferred, and exercised the body with activities of my choosing. 

Over the course of the first year, the atoms in my body leave and I'm reformed with a new set of atoms. From this delicate arrangement of atoms, a consciousness arises. I never realize this though, because I don't have an understanding of dependent arising/origination. There is simply ""me.""

Even though I have a new body and consciousness, I can't erase the actions I took previously. If the first body ate junkfood and sat on the couch all day, it doesn't matter that I have a new form-- the first body created the factors for obesity to arise and the second body is still dealing with the consequences. This, I think, is an example of how karma transfers from body to body to follow the mindstream.

This had repeated itself for the last 23 years of my life. But yesterday, I realized something. I was never one specific set of atoms, or one specific consciousness. I experienced all of these as if it were one continuous stream-- the mindstream.

Having found an example of the mindstream that can be observed empirically, I feel confident in the Buddha's teachings. I understand that this might not be EXACTLY what the Buddha meant, but I feel like  it isn't a stretch that when this body ends for good, the mindstream will continue.

I'll go away and focus on self-improvement, and it works, for a time. I'll work harder than I ever have, set goals for myself, and by and large achieve them. Then something will happen that reveals the suffering under everything; like acquaintances being downright cruel to me, or that inherent dissatisfaction with life appearing again and again. And so I find myself being drawn back to Buddhism. I begin meditating and find myself thinking what a waste of my life such a practice is (I could be doing X or Y!). I gain nothing from the practice, other than more bitter feelings towards the world (though concealed in a kind of self-delusion that I'm meeting my 'goal' of 20 minutes a day, etc.). 

But I find the core tenets of Buddhism so utterly grounded in fact that I feel I must find a way to live life as a Buddhist, to practice compassion (because we all suffer), and to find some semblance of peace. Yet when I think about having no attachments, I envisage a nihilistic existence where (romantic) love is forbidden due to the associated attachments, where there is an understand that whatever I do, it's all worthless because it comes to an end; and these two examples heavily jar with what I'd like out of life (that is, romance and some degree of 'success'). I think I'm not properly understanding these terms, which is why I think the conflict is there in my head.

If I have no money, that's okay. If I don't have a house or a bed, that's okay. I can sleep anywhere, I can eat any food. My whole life is freedom. I am free to do anything. Having no hindrance means not being attached to anything. So this hippie-mind is very good; it is a very high-class mind. But many young people are attached to hippie-style or natural-style living. This is no good. If you are attached, then hippie-style becomes a hindrance. You must cut off all thinking and all desires for yourself. Then you will soon attain enlightenment. The hippie-mind is only one hair's-breadth away from enlightenment. If a hippie could cut off his attachment to being a hippie, he would soon discover, 'Oh, this is enlightenment!' One of my first students in America had very long blond hair, which he wore in a pony-tail. One day I said to him, 'I think it would be good if you cut your hair.' He said, 'No no, I like my hair the way it is.' I said, 'If you are attached to your hair, you cannot attain enlightenment.' 'Okay, then I will cut my hair.' 'Fine. Now you don't need to cut it.' So he learned that being a true hippie is having no attachments. Afterwards, he did hard training and soon understood.

&gt;""Ignorant people claim that everything is mind.

&gt;They are deluded about the three types of appearance,

&gt;Have many shortcomings, mix things up and overexaggerate.

&gt;Meditators, give up such unwholesome ways!""



The three types of appearances are:

* _percieved objects_ are the mere presence of objects to the senses (forms that appear before the eye, sounds that appear before the ear, scents that appear before the nose, etc). 

* _appearances_ which are the thoughts of attachment, anger, or delusion which are based of the perceived objects, for instance the feeling of attachment to a pleasant object, the feeling of anger towards an unpleasant one, or the feeling of indifference towards something neutral

* _the perciever_ which is our own mind

Saying that all three of those are mind is not correct, as Longchenpa points out. In particular we should distinguish between perceived objects and appearances. 
Perceived objects are not mind, they exist outside of our consciousness, but it cannot be said they lack reality outside our minds. It is not like the moon disappears when nobody is looking at it.

Appearances, on the other had, are mind, and since all we really know are appearances, it is tempting to speculate that all is mind. In fact, the senses perceive the external objects, and relay that information to the perciever, but they do not present their information directly. We do not actually see their output, but merely the interpretation of it by our own minds. We only see the appearances. Appearances only occur in our mind, and as such are not completely accurate, they depend on interpretation, but since no two persons have the same interpretation, we cannot say for sure either of them is real. 


In the Treasure of Valid Logic, Sakya Pandita writes:

&gt;Sense consciousnesses are like mutes with eyes,

&gt;While thoughts are blind but talkative.

&gt;Self-awareness has all its faculties

&gt;And conveys meaning to the two.


The senses can't really say anything good or bad, about what they sense, nor do they have any consciousness of what they are sensing. The eye sees blue, and conveys that to the mind, but it does not think ""this is blue"", or ""this is pretty"". 

In contrast, the mind is like a loquacious blind person. It does not actually see forms or hear sounds, but thinks about them and evaluates them as good, bad, etc. 
There is no real connection between perceived objects and appearances. The bridge between them is self-awareness. Self awareness knows what the eye sees, and knows what the mind thinks. It is as if self-awareness goes and talks to the mind, and the three together work things out.

Appearances are all in the mind, but that does not mean that mind is all there is. The universe still exists while we're not looking, even if we cannot see it directly.

I've found that sloth and torpor are a major hindrance that can be fixed easily with a little effort. Many of us underestimate the importance of a full night's restful sleep, but in my experience nothing changes your quality of life and quality of daily mindfulness than having a well rested and energetic body and mind. Here are some tips that might help you. 

- Sleep 8 hours. There obviously can be variations in this, but most people need 8 hours and not more. If you're sleeping less than 7 hours, there's a very high chance you're under-sleeping. Some people below are reporting that this is too high. I think it's best to test out different sleep lengths and see for yourself. 
- Dark Therapy. The body is naturally programmed to start the sleep cycle with the onset of darkness. Stop looking at bright screens 2 hours before bed-time. If you can't do that, install [flux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) on your computer. If you can, buy a pair of orange sunglasses and wear them inside the house in the same period. Avoid reading on the I-Pad etc. 
- Light Therapy. It's ideal to wake up to the rising sun, keep your window open. If you wake up before sun-up, try to buy a light-therapy alarm clock. 
- Deficiencies. Most of us are deficient in Omega-3 fatty acids, Vitamin D and Magnesium. Buy [fish-oil tablets](http://examine.com/supplements/Fish+Oil/), [Vitamin D tablets](http://examine.com/supplements/Vitamin+D/) and [Magnesium or ZMA tablets](http://examine.com/supplements/Magnesium/) (facts and benefits of these linked). You can expect better immunity and an overall better quality of life with these. Magnesium is particularly useful for a restful sleep. 
- Exercise. This one is kind of obvious. If you don't exercise, why not? One hour of mindful exercise everyday is one of the best things you can do for yourself. 
- Caffeine. Cut it out. Caffeine is a stimulant that is only useful if you're already not properly rested and is almost immediately habit forming. It screws with your sleep in all sorts of ways. Keep it to a minimum, and try to avoid having if you don't really need it. Sometimes people have anxiety/jitterness issues that are all a result of too much coffee. 
- Melatonin. This is a naturally occurring compound in the body that regulates the sleep cycle. If your sleep cycle is messed up (sleep kicks in too late), supplementing with melatonin for a few days is completely safe and beneficial. It also helps a lot if you're suffering from jet-lag. 
- Meditation! 30 minutes before bed especially if you've had a very busy day will help calm your mind down and I've found it generally leads to more pleasant dreams. Thanks to cosmo_demonic.


If anyone would like to correct me on any of these points, I would be most grateful. Please feel free to add. I myself suffer from bad sleep occasionally thanks  to not following all these recommendations (especially the caffeine and dark-therapy bit), but I'm working on it!

1366568266.0,69,self.Buddhism,1ct7p9,What the Buddha thought after his awakening,numbersev,72,3,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1ct7p9/what_the_buddha_thought_after_his_awakening/,"I have heard that on one occasion, the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Bodhi tree — the tree of awakening — newly awakened. And on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session, sensitive to the bliss of release. Then, with the passing of seven days, after emerging from that concentration, he surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened One. As he did so, he saw living beings burning with the many fevers and aflame with the many fires born of passion, aversion, &amp; delusion.

Then, on realizing the significance of that, he on that occasion exclaimed:

    This world is burning.
    Afflicted by contact,
    it calls disease a 'self.'
    By whatever means it construes [anything],
    it becomes otherwise than that.[1]Becoming otherwise,
    the world is
    attached to becoming
    afflicted by becoming
    and yet delights
    in that very becoming.
    Where there's delight,
    there is fear. 
    What one fears
    is stressful.
    This holy life is lived
    for the abandoning of becoming.
    Whatever contemplatives or brahmans say that liberation from becoming is by means of becoming, 
    all of them        
    are not released from becoming, I say.

And whatever contemplatives or brahmans say that escape from becoming is by means of non-becoming, all of them have not escaped from becoming, I say.


    For this stress comes into play
    in dependence on every acquisition.[2]
    With the ending of every clinging/sustenance,
    there's no stress coming into play.
    Look at this world:
    Beings, afflicted with thick ignorance,
    are unreleased
    from passion for what has come to be.
    All levels of becoming,
    anywhere,
    in any way,
    are inconstant, stressful, subject to change.
    Seeing this — as it's come to be —
    with right discernment,
    one abandons craving for becoming,
    and doesn't delight in non-becoming.[3]
    From the total ending of craving
    comes fading &amp; cessation without remainder:
    unbinding.
    For the monk unbound
    through lack of clinging/sustenance,
    there's no further becoming.
    He has conquered Māra,
    won the battle,
    having gone beyond becomings
    : Such.

It is simply me being curious and thinking critically. 

Since joining this subreddit, I have seen a good number of posts by people claiming to have done everything from bypassing the first 3 jhanas and going straight to the 4th, to immediately seeing the interconnectedness of all things in the same way as the Buddha and many other lofty claims like these. Now, I am not even pretending to act like I know for a fact none of these things are true, and that these people did not experience this. But the fact is, I, personally, don't buy it. I respect that you may have experienced these things or things that you may have understood to be these things. But i simply cannot accept that by using ""heedless substances"" that the Buddha expressly says not to use, that you suddenly by chance gained the insight that was achieved by the Buddha after cultivating the Perfections (paramita) over numerous LIFETIMES. It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me that there would be some kind of short cut that monastics and other people pursuing enlightenment (most often through a lifetime commitment) simply don't use. Supposing these substances really did lead to any level of enlightnement, would the Buddhist community not embrace them to a certain degree? While (as far as I know) the Buddha couldn't predict the future, he specifically spoke against drugs and alcohol. If a drug of some kind could lead to enlightenment and end someone's suffering, would the Buddha not instead advise it's use. The Buddha said drugs and alcohol ""lead to heedlessness"". In this case, could that heedlessness perhaps be percieving that you are doing things only achievable by the Buddha, when in actuality, you are laying on your bedroom floor in your underwear drooling? I'm a pretty open-minded guy, so if someone could offer a VALID LOGICAL counterpoint to my own I would love to listen. If anyone wants to just share something about their thoughts on the subject, I like to listen just as much!

Again, to be clear, this was not a malicious jab at those who have found their way to Buddhism through drugs. I can't speak for everyone else, but I'm glad to have you on the Path, no matter how the fuck you ended up on it. But this should be taken in no other way then a human being sharing his opinion and extending an open ended question.

EDIT: Rewording. 

EDIT #2: So, this has been a fantastic success in my opinion. While I have gotten a large variety of responses, and have gotten to hear a good amount of others' experiences, the fact that I asked this question really did help me to answer the questions I had in my head. As I've always known, but had to be reminded, there is no substitute for experience. But in hearing the ""helicopter"" analogy and the several new (to me) ways of looking at recreational drug use for a purpose beyond doing it just to say you did or just to get high, I have gained a new appreciation for it. Thank you all for your responses, they truly did help!

After the third time of hitting the snooze I sat up and put on some shorts and a t-shirt.  I casually walked downstairs totally disregarding what I looked like and the rituals I had yet to perform (i.e. brushing teeth, shower, urinating, etc.).  I let my dogs out and walked outside with them as they performed their business as usual.  

It was raining.  The rain hit me in the face and it was cold.  Granted, it was a light rain, so I didn't mind, it still was getting me wet.  I felt so alive outside standing in the rain with my dogs.  In the distance the sky was a beige color, but there was no break.  I thought the sun was going to come out, but it didn't.  No matter.  I felt like I was ""one"" with my surroundings and that everything was so perfect at that moment.  I drifted off in my thoughts, and found myself elsewhere.  I was somewhere in Florida walking around in a tropical forest, and then I came out to a resort area, like one of the many disney resorts.  I saw palm trees, little lizards climbing, birds flying overhead, the sun was still rising, and the warm air gave me goose-bumps as I walked back to a place I had been in a previous trip to Florida.   I don't know why I drifted there, but I was there and I was happy.  For the brief span of maybe 5 seconds, I smiled.

And like so, no matter how many energy drinks you take, the 400 pounds are not going to get lighter.

The list is long of things that demotivate us, and we harbour them unconsciously. Then one day we say ""Oh, I lack motivation to do ANYTHING"", but actually we are seeing things upside down, because it's not that we *lack* anything, but actually we have *a lot* of something and we need to get rid of it.

Some things that demotivate us are:

- Creative constrains we over exaggerate. If we are limited, well, accept the limits and accept that the outcome might as well be limited by such thing. No worries.

- Too much pressure on the outcome. Well, even if it is important, most of us under perform if we think it's deadly important. It's ok to give it importance (middle path), but too much importance as to be frozen in our place, is the same as not caring at all. Don't worry, if it doesn't work, well, you did your best.

- Fears in general. We fear critics, we fear rejection, we fear failure, mockery, etc. It's ok to consider them, but again, if they are freezing you to death, it's of no use. Just lower it a little bit. Don't worry to much about it.

- Thinking you are out of options. We always have options, and like the old saying goes: If your problem has a solution why worry? and if it doesn't, why worry?


When things we enjoy and like doing do not move us, it might not be that we need to increase them in quantity, quality or strength... But that we have something that's interfering the natural input from them.

""And then I come across the baby bird, lying on the pavement.

I stop walking and stand dumbstruck, unsure of what to do,

Because death has no home within the human heart.

And as I stand, death struggling to fight its way in.

the bird’s chest rises, caught in a struggle of its own.

----

 Each breath is labored, painful and barely gained.

I realize now I am not witnessing the dead, but the dying.

And while death may not have room in my heart,

suffering is well known to me.

----

And now a new struggle rises in tandem with the baby birds.

What can I do? Where lies the noble path?

To be kind would be to exchange suffering for death,

but death has no home within my heart.

And with deep mindfulness I stare,

 and share in the suffering of the baby bird.

----

And as I turn to go, my hands fall into mudras.

My voice dedicates merit, and hopes for well being.

The next day, I see the bird has lost its struggle, 

and the earth begins its own struggle to reclaim it.

Among cracked bones and torn flesh,

The suffering of other creatures ends.

----

And though death may have no home within the human heart,

Suffering will always be an unwelcome guest.

And for all the words I said and thoughts I had,

nothing transcends the sharing of suffering between two beings.

Because in its last moments, I could not help the bird.

But I can share in its suffering, that I might relieve its burden.""

I stood there watching for a very long time, and people gave me some odd looks walking by (it was on my college campus outside my dorm). It was an interesting moment for me, to really experience how common death and suffering are. We are of the nature to die, and there is no way we can escape death.

This brand of Christianity is the ultimate ego-driven philosophy - hence my username. It fosters guilt as a mechanism to keep you crawling back on your knees asking for forgiveness. Guilt about your actions, words, thoughts, even the very essence of who you are. It creates a subservient ego-image that you must identify with... and to hate. I hated myself for almost 20 years as a dirty sinner. It also creates a separate image - God - that is just a secondary projection of one's own ideas and desires. 

It is a system of denial and isolation... a system of condemnation - of others and of yourself... they are learning that everyone else who does not believe as they do will burn in hell... they are learning that everyone who does not agree with them is God's enemy, and therefore is also their enemy... they are learning to feel guilty about every thought - to mask their true feelings in a fake veneer of religiosity to appease those around them... they are learning that conformity is more important than honesty and being genuine and real... they are learning to utilize and hone confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance in order to keep their beliefs from crumbling under the weight of the facts... there is so much more... your interpretation of the Bible is the infallible, ultimate authority - and a perfect reflection of God's thoughts and wishes... 

I can see them becoming who I was. I almost didn't escape it; and most do not. I can't keep them away from my family yet. We live together... they are too young for me to be able to teach them to think critically... they just believe the stories that they are told without question.

I've been violating the Fifth Precept and the words just kinds flowed. Spell checked for your reading pleasure.

So I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I wanted to just share it with people. Much of what I say may come across as ""completely obvious"" or sounds like I""m spouting meaningless platitudes. I've come to realize that this may be a large part of what it means when Zen Buddhists say ""it can't be explained, you have to understand it for yourself"", not because it's so complicated, but because it sounds so utterly simple that people often just dismiss it as a platitude.

The biggest thing I've taken from Buddhism, the biggest thing I've tried to incorporate in my life outside of the Five Precepts, is living in the moment. Trying to appreciate the present moment for what it is, instead of constantly dwelling in the past or future. I was sitting at work today, in one of the most tedious, mind numbing jobs I've ever experienced. I was beyond bored. There has to be a new word for it, because it felt like I was on the verge of insanity. Minutes where stretching like hours. Every time I looked at the clock, I couldn't help but do the mental math of how many hours and minutes until the end of the day. Thinking of how much I wanted to be away from here, away from the present moment. It was this realization that made me realize that I was basically performing the opposite of mindfulness. Instead of being here in the present moment paying attention to what was happening right now, to what I was thinking, to the sounds and actions around me, I was living in an imaginary world called the future. Every time I was looking at the clock, I was longing to be away form the ""now, quite fruitlessly to be sure. And I realized that the farther away from the ""now"" i got, the more miserable I felt. When boredom sets in, we have a tendency to do whatever we can to escape it. But in that moment, I realized that I was thinking about things incorrectly. I was longing to be somewhere I wasn't, and somewhere I couldn't be/. I was like a dukkha generating machine, and I just felt worse and worse the more I thought about how bored I was, and how much I didn't want to be there.

SO I tried something. Whenever I thought I was bored, I'd sit there and analyze it. Why am I bored/ What does boredom feel like? The funny thing about boredom is that the moment I focused on it, the moment I tried to turn it into an object to be observed, it dissipated. Try as I might, I couldn't observe it as it was happening. Why is this? Where did it go? So from that, I came up with a theory.

Boredom is just an expression of the desire to be ""somewhere else"". The more you live in another moment, whether past or future, and long for it, the worse the present moment seems. When you long to be away from the present moment, the present moment seems dull and horrible by comparison, because you create an idealized version of what ""not now"" is in your mind. But when you come back to the present moment, when you really analyze what's going on, you realize it isn't so bad. Hell, it isn't bad at all. The more I tried to stay in the present, the less work bothered me, the less I felt bored, and before I knew it, my day was cruising by exponentially faster. By applying a sense of mindfulness, of living in the present moment, I was actively reducing suffering on an observable level. Sometimes it would get away from me, and I'd start staring at the clock, but I can't help but feel like I""ve made a realization, I've applied something from practice to my every day life.

I see this ""present moment"" philosophy in a lot of places in my life. Idealizing future moments and past moments, instead of living in the present. When I become lazy, I realize what I'm doing is saying ""I'll get to that later"". Later is an undefinable moment in the future, and as any Buddhist will tell you, later is never now. It's always later. By putting things off to a moment that never comes, they never get done. but when I decided ""I'm going to do it, right now, present moment. The only moment that's here""

A)They didn't seem so bad
B) Shit actually gets done

I've been trying to live as much as possible in teh ""Eternal Now"" now. You never realize how much unhappiness and suffering is caused by living elsewhere until you actively observe yourself doing it, but man, it's surprising. Next time you're at work, and you find yourself thinking about what fun stuff you'll do when you get home, stop it. Stop living in the future. Focus on the now, think about what you're doing, what's going on around you/ Whenever your brain starts to drift away formt he now, drag it back. When you do this, you don't even think about the clock. Living in the now is the biggest cure to boredom I've found.",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,,True,t3_kdr4z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/kdr4z/what_buddhist_philosophy_has_provided_to_my/,

Often, an observation will be given that one of the opinions is ""not Buddhism"".

This thread is meant to explain what I think about the phenomena, and to facilitate a discussion about it between Buddhists and non-Buddhists.

I'm going to start be stating that it's not meant as an offense. It doesn't mean ""you're wrong"". It doesn't mean ""you shouldn't believe that"". It just means that the opinion doesn't agree with Buddhism.

Keep in mind that Buddhism is a religion. It has many (many many) religious texts. It has a long line of religious leaders. It has a heritage of concepts and the interpretation thereof.

That's what Buddhism is like. An established religion.

Problem is, some (wellknown religious) people/authors ""borrow"" Buddhism to support their words (just like some people ""borrow"" quantum physics to sell some bracelets to improve your balance and overall wellbeing). Heck, there's even a dedicated blog to list all the fakebuddhaquotes.com. Not only do they say ""this is how Buddha's teachings should be interpreted"", they say ""this is what the Buddha actually say"".

Again, this is not saying that those messages are wrong and you should not listen to them. It's not the message, but the claim that ""this is Buddhism"" that's false.

Imagine someone saying that ""Darth Vader is not Luke's father! Anakin actually died and Palpatine sent his disciple to pretend to be Anakin!""  
Umm, did you even watch the movie?  
""No, man, the movies suck!""  
Read the books?  
""That's boring! I read the memes.""  
What you said isn't Star Wars.  
""But THIS MAKES MORE SENSE, MAN! You don't know Star Wars, man!""  
Umm, I do, I watched the movies, read the books, played the games, Grand Admiral Thrawn kicks ass. What you said is not Star Wars.  
""You don't have monopoly on Star Wars!""  
...

(Exaggerated for comic relief)

He *might* be right, you know. That *may* make more sense (to him, at least). But that still isn't Star Wars. That's just an observation. Star Wars has a canon, a much-agreed-upon set of history, concepts, and interpretations. If it doesn't fit, it's not SW.

So please don't get offended if someone says your beliefs ""is not Buddhism"". You might be right, and Buddhism might turn out to be wrong, but that's still not Buddhism.

You ***can***, however, defend your stance by stating the basis of your belief. There are many traditions in Buddhism, some of them might not agree with each other, but they're all still Buddhism. If your belief is based on Buddhism, just say so. But this is common sense.. I.. don't know why I felt the need to say that.

    Materialities are like balls of foam,
    Feelings are like bubbles,
    Perceptions are like mirages,
    Volitions are like banana trees,
    Consciousnesses are like magical illusions. 
    -Samyutta Nikaya

Just as balls of foam on ocean waves break apart and disappear, bodies perish, solid objects break apart and sensory impressions change. 

Feelings are like ephemeral bubbles on water; they arise due to momentary conditions, exist just for an instant, and then pop - they vanish and leave nothing behind. 

""For one cannot grasp a mirage and drink it, or wash in it, or bathe in it, or fill a pot with it...And just as a mirage deceives travelers and makes them say that a full lake has been seen, perception also deceives them and makes them say 'this is blue, beautiful, pleasant and permanent'.""

The scope of the aggregate of mental formations is vast. Although experiences are composed of many mental factors that function together to form the interdependent state, they are essentially hollow and without a core - like a banana tree. ""One cannot take anything from a plantain stem and bring it away to make even so much as a rafter....a plantain stem is a combination of many sheaths, so also the formations aggregate is a combination of many states.""

Consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition dependent upon which it arises. When consciousness is reckoned by eye and materiality it is considered eye-consciousness.  There is no pre existing consciousness just waiting for a perception to impinge. Consciousness contains no intrinsic qualities; it simply performs the function of cognizing whatever object impacts the senses.

I've got a ""friend"", he's more a mutual friend of my other friends and I never really liked him, but this is only getting worse. We have a very close group of friend and I see him almost every day.

The reasons why I can't stand him any more are a lot of small things.

He's owns money to some friends which he pretends to be forgotten about. When we go out drinking he's always very aware to make the maximum out of other people paying for drinks. When he comes over to eat and notices that there won't be enough he'll be sure to get a plate full before everything is empty.

He makes an enormous amount of noise, he can't stop talking and every time keeps on going about a subject even if it's very clear that everybody else doesn't like it. This gets a lot worse when he's drunk.

He's the most selfish person I know but he's not a bad person, it's like he wants to be friendly but can't help being selfish. He also drinks and smokes weed every day and I think this indicates some kind of problem, which is why I don't want to get to offensive because I'm scared he'll go down the wrong road even more. I think his friends (he still sees me as a friend, and maybe I still am) are the only thing keeping him from becoming an alcoholic.

There are many more things but I think the negativity of this post might get to high for r/buddhism.

I know that this hate is only causing pain to me and doesn't contribute to anything solving the problem but I think you all know how hard it can be to let go. The problem is I see him about every day and I can't help but focusing on all the things he does.

He knows I don't like him (EDIT I don't go out with him alone or anything, and he knows I don't like him making to much noise at my and my friends house), but I don't get mad or anything. I do speak my mind from time to time, but always in a (maybe to) friendly way.

I'm a little into buddhism but not enough to know how to deal with this, but I think of it as a test to practice buddhism in real life situation.

People will often criticize Buddhism by basically saying that by eliminating one's desires and emotions and in promoting a kind of stoic lifestyle, you lose the good parts of life as well as the bad. They say you may get rid of suffering, but in doing so you lose the part of life that makes us human. So they say instead of trying to eliminate desire, rather to fill yourself with the desire to live and experience the world and all it has to offer and feel all the strong emotions associated with this, both good and bad.

It's a classic problem I've heard many times, and never really been sure what to think about it. Is this a valid criticism of Buddhism? Does Buddhism really promote a quiet, stoic style of life?

Life is basically a gesture, but no one, no thing, is making it. There is no necessity for it to happen, and none for it to go on happening. For it isn't being driven by anything; it just happens freely of itself. It's a gesture of motion, of sound, of color, and just as no one is making it, it isn't happening to anyone. There is simply no problem of life; it is completely purposeless play—exuberance which is its own end. Basically there is the gesture. Time, space, and multiplicity are complications of it. There is no reason whatever to explain it, for explanations are just another form of complexity, a new manifestation of life on top of life, of gestures gesturing. Pain and suffering are simply extreme forms of play, and there isn't anything in the whole universe to be afraid of because it doesn't happen to anyone! There isn't any substantial ego at all. The ego is a kind of flip, a knowing of knowing, a fearing of fearing. It's a curlicue, an extra jazz to experience, a sort of double-take or reverberation, a dithering of consciousness which is the same as anxiety.

Of course, to say that life is just a gesture, an action without agent, recipient, or purpose, sounds much more empty and futile than joyous. But to me it seems that an ego, a substantial entity to which experience happens, is more of a minus than a plus. It is an estrangement from experience, a lack of participation. And in this moment I feel absolutely with the world, free of that chronic resistance to experience which blocks the free flowing of life and makes us move like muscle-bound dancers. But I don't have to overcome resistance. I see that resistance, ego, is just an extra vortex in the stream--part of it—and that in fact there is no actual resistance at all. There is no point from which to confront life, or stand against it.""

Sharing your creations is terrifying because when you let people see it they have every right to think it’s terrible.

They have a right to think it’s weird or boring or stupid, but they also have the right to think it’s awesome and wonderful.

The most terrifying creation you make and share is your self. We’re not born with a self, we create it; you make ‘you’.

You make yourself from the books you read, the music you listen to, the things you love and the things you hate…

So when you share that it’s terrifying because you know people have a right to dislike it 

When you meet a stranger you make a ‘you’ inside of them, and you don’t want to do a bad job

That’s why we all fear judgement. People make a ‘you’ inside of them and you don’t want that ‘you’ to be wrong 

That’s why feeling scared or sad is so beautiful. Being scared shows just how much you care about the ‘you’ you’ve made

The best way to get over this fear is not to hide from it, to try being like everyone else or to not even try at all, it’s to run with it

Keep creating for your friends and your family and your idols and your peers in spite of the fear

“To Make you the ‘you’ that you feel best inside of” – Hank Green

""The fear doesn’t go away; you just get more comfortable in it""


This is a sort of 'idea' of the way the mind and consciousness works when thinking about other people. How do you feel about this?

How do we overcome this fear? Do we embrace it? Do we separate ourselves from it? Is the fear all irrational? I'm curious to see what a Buddhist type of 'conclusion' for this problem is.

It really is not difficult to be kind to each other when we realize we are all connected to each other through the experiencing of this life in this reality, all emerging in the same way and all leaving one day the same way. Why make anyone's life worse than better when we are all equal in the way we experience existence...from birth completely powerless, to death, finality of the physical. Everybody would be grateful, and we would all experience less struggle, suffering, and misery as we go through this experience we call Life. Think about this next time you have a thought that would be a creative force for something that would hurt someone else and shift your position of awareness so that you are on the receiving end of that same projected harm. You wouldn't want to experience that...you wouldn't want to experience that at all. Life is a blip on a timewave. Let's never lose sight of how precious it is for everyone.

I have seen some of you troubled by this concept. This one and also the attachment ones. There are more things in Buddhism than those two concepts... For real. Don't stress that much on them.

The way some are approaching it is like if you wanted to explain a kid who has never seen ice what ice is and you told them: it's the state in which two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen are when they get under 0º C. It's accurate, yes, it's understandable, not so much at that point. It's more easy, far better, more complete explanation to just show him the ice and put it in his hand.

Buddhism is not taught like the "" two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen"" example. This is just forcing the knowledge, like many schools already do with children and adults. Don't force it like that. There are many more important things you must learn before this: to know, accept and understand your emotions, to know, accept and understand your actions, to know, accept and understand your nature... The same with the emotions, actions and nature of others. To understand what really happens around you, what things are and aren't, to understand the potential of your mind and cognition, to be able to experience it. To see your mind as it is.

After you understand these and many other things, only then no-self and no-attachment will make sense and will not make any conflict at all.

All teachings are incredibly easy to obtain, but you have to obtain them in the right order, otherwise it'll only force you.

Noble Eightfold path, four noble truths, dharma, karma, rebirth... you are eating the cake before the party.

Have you fixed your problems with your family? Are you able to face your problems or even recognize them? Are the causes of what's happening to you fully clear? Does your mind feels clear only when meditating but not long after stopping meditation? Does the behavior of others seems impossible to understand? Does your feelings seem impossible to understand? Do you feel unable to keep yourself motivated? Does your fears stop you from doing what you want? Do you find easy to do what's uneasy or hard for you?

If the answer to any of those were a ""no"" then you are indeed studying advanced things out of time when studying karma, rebirth, non-attachement and no-self.

If you sincerely answered ""yes"" to them all then feel free to ignore this post.

Otherwise please understand that studying some things out of time in buddhism will only make you view them out of context and may mislead you.

PD: No-self or any other buddhism teaching isn't like putting out a cigarette, it's more as baking a cake... If you followed each step of the recipe right you'll naturally have a cake. If you didn't you'll have a flat bread that'll disappoint you.",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,True,,,True,t3_jleuq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/jleuq/noself_isnt_like_putting_out_a_cigarette/,

Naturally, I work hard trying to get the deliveries to customers as fast as possible because it means more pay. The people who don't tip are usually a trigger for my ego to get angry or annoyed, even for that split second. I can't stand having the bad thoughts, but I acknowledge them, and let them go and I'm on with my day. However, today was different. 

I went to a house I go to at least two times a week and I know, every single time that I'm not getting a tip. They don't tip if I'm early or late or if the food is hot or cold, it's just not going to happen. Knowing that fact and that I would feel slighted I still took their order to the door. I chatted with the guy and gave him his change back. This is where my ego usually blurts out something hateful in a bid to make myself feel better, but this time it never came. 

See, I was waiting for the negative reaction, waiting to turn it away and let go and when that feeling never came I got confused. I started thinking about *why* I didn't feel that way with this particular family but I *would* feel that way, even for a split second, about their next door neighbors or any other delivery for that matter. It didn't take long for the answer to come to me...

While I don't know this family personally they obviously have some medical issues. It is a grandmother who is at least partially disabled taking care of some of her grandchildren and the grandson walks with a noticeable limp and has some slight learning disabilities. I always see him riding his bike around town, alone, with headphones on and that's when I realized that I never had that angry ego because I identified with these people. I live with my grandmother, and I consider myself to be a pretty private person, usually with headphones on, and while I don't normally ride a bike I love to get out and just *be* like I imagine this kid does when he goes on bike rides around town. I didn't have an angry ego because I was compassionate and I could empathize with these people. Their problems were visible, easily seen and recognized and it made it easy to see their suffering and to love them, to forget one's self and just be joyful of the opportunity to bring these people their food, to see them smile.

All beings suffer. Some suffering is visible, but much is invisible. While I knew that before, today provided the perfect lesson on just how important it is to remember that fact in each and every moment.

That's not to say I'm **""Forever Alone""**, I just am social when I feel like it, which is really only about 25% of the time these days. I like doing my own thing and not being hassled by others or drug around to this or that thing that I usually do not enjoy.

I spent the past couple years working abroad in relative solitude, and came to the unpleasant realization that my particular brand of ""solitude"" is not at all entirely honest.

I seem to make up for the lack of being around actual, real people by being online nearly constantly -- if there is an internet connection nearby, I have to be connected to Facebook, Reddit, a couple other forums -- what I have found through introspection that myself (and I'd wager many others) like this medium of socialization because it gives us complete control of social situations. If I don't like someone I'm chatting to, I can just sign off and not suffer much inconvenience. Conversely, not too many of us can just walk right out of a bar when we're in an unenjoyable situation.

It is quite clear to me that this is an emotionally-motivated addiction that I am very uncomfortable with, as I would be much better off spending that time alone doing things that need to be done, reading, exercising, hiking, etc.

I'm relatively new to [practical] Buddhism, and was wondering if anybody could point me in the right direction of how to break away from the psychological ""need"" to feel connected and learn to be okay with being *truly* alone.

**TL-DR - Teach me Buddhist concepts to help me psychologically get to the point where I can, emotionally, be ""truly alone"" and spend my free-time better rather than feel emotionally shackled to an internet connection.**


****EDIT: There are no problems RE: social anxiety/being uncomfortable in social situations. That is not the issue -- I have no problems making friends, and a fair social circle. It is just that I would prefer to be alone most of the time --- I feel like 25% sociability is a pretty adequate time percentage to spend being ""out and about"", so to speak.****",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,True,,,True,t3_pexk2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/pexk2/on_peace_solitude_and_the_internet/,

His Holiness describes how we may confuse pleasure with happiness and this can make it difficult to choose actions leading to happiness, especially when the choice denies us pleasure. This pattern is evident in my own life when I think about my goals and how/when I cheat.

The suggestion was, when craving arises, to ask if the action will make you happy. By framing the question this way you are not faced with denying yourself something you want but reenforcing a goal for something else you want.

My example from last night starts as I'm driving home after dinner, the monologue went something like this:

* Brain: I'd like some snacks
* Me: ...
* Brain: No, really. I want snacks. Coke and chips. 
* Me: I should stop at 7/11 and grab some coke and chips!
* Brain: Exactly! Coke and chips! Coke and Chips!
* Mindfulness: That feeling of craving sure is growing stronger...
* Brain: (singing) coke and chips, coke and chips, Oh how I love some coke and chips. Can I have some icecream too?

I have two goals right now that haven't been going well. The first is consuming less junk and the second is saving money. Coke, chips and ice cream do not in any way forward these goals. 

* Me: Wait a sec, coke and chips and icecream... Will this make me happy?

And that was it. The craving disolved immeditately. I doubt this is a magic bullet but the acknowledgement of my greater goals and framing the scenario such that I was gaining by abstaining my brain shifted gears automatically.

Interestingly enough the moment the craving went away I realized how thirsty I was and was reminded about the cold jug of water I have at home.",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,,True,t3_lr89o,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/lr89o/will_this_make_me_happy/,

We're told to strive for beauty that we can never achieve. We spend billions of dollars on products that give us a few moments of beauty but never true happiness. 

Desire is everywhere. TV tells us to desire money and wealth. We desire expensive cars (or just a newer car than the one we've got). We desire gold watches and iPhones. We desire addictive cigarettes and instant hamburgers.

We work and rush and focus on making money ... and ignore all the wonderful things that are already around us. We hate our jobs, but we keep working. We hate our lives but we keep pushing on. We hate our girlfriends/wives/husbands/boyfriends but we stay with them or break up and get someone new (who we'll hate soon too). 

Generally we treat each other like shit. We're mean to our families and friends, we're mean to other people who are complete strangers. We hate entire segments of society because of some bullshit prejudice. We hate other countries because they're better or worse than ours. We hate people who succeed but desire to be successful ourselves. We spend all of our time criticising others when they can do something we can't. 

Corporations are greedy and are doing serious harm to society and the environment. They feed us junk food and then tell us we're ugly. They poison the environment and air so that we can drive to work 5 minutes faster. They hoard money, pay themselves billions in bonuses, then fire all the lowest paid staff. They spend all their effort to tell us how much we need their products ... and we believe every damn word of it. 

I'm just ranting here ... and I know I'm very much a part of western society too. I desire things (even though I try not to). I own an iphone. I work because I need the money. I get angry at people for really stupid reasons. 

I'm just saying that although I personally try to do my best and I try to study Buddhism and become more mindful I'm honestly mediocre at it. 

That's my question. Is our society really that bad or am I in a horribly negative mood? Is there any serious hope that western society (in general) can eventually become moderate and more mindful?",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,,True,t3_hdau0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/hdau0/dae_think_that_western_society_is_heading_in_the/,

If I was born in India, there would be little doubt in my mind, my religion would be different. So, losing that, I looked for empirical evidence to support what religions could be true, and I found more evidence supporting atheism than anything.

What I am trying to get at, is that I can respect religions. I respect religions so much that I can't say one is more right than another. So in my opinion, your religion is not as right as Catholicism, or Hinduism. 

I do admire the manner in which you worship. I find it to be a lot more peaceful, and less intrusive on other peoples lives.

I'm disciple of Shi Long Yun, disciple of Shi Sheng He (Bhikkhu). Both Shaolin monks.

I've treated people of all kinds, backgrounds and problems, from the very young to some quite old. From rich to poor. And they all share the same basic problems, with the same basic solutions; so your problem might probably not be so unfamiliar to me.

I have also gone from most states, from completely delusional and suffering to all clear and focused. From completely attached to the body, to completely detached to the body through dream-meditation. Not all states, but many, and many from the common life, so again, I think your situation might not be so unfamiliar to me.

I consider myself at the anagami state, or non-returner having eradicated completely the first five hindrances to enlightenment:

- The belief in a permanent personality, ego
- Doubt, extreme skepticism
- Attachment to rites, rituals, and ceremonies
- Attachment to sense desires
- Ill-will, anger

So you might ask me up to that level of understanding.

I know the sub-reddit isn't too friendly to all claims of achievements or the like, but, I'm taking a chance here, hoping people will try to get and focus on something good about it for themselves, instead of focusing on negative things for themselves or others. But either way it's fine.

I know a bit about yogacara, dzogchen, tantra, and the like.

I've read and practiced the diamond sutra, the heart sutra, the lotus sutra and the surangama sutra.

I used to post here a lot but lately I've found that I'm having a lot of trouble 'teaching buddhism' here, specially since people already have their own bias about what things mean, and since there's not much to do there, I gave it a rest. But now I have a bit more time so here I am.

Anyway, I hope this is of benefit for everyone, and hope you let me help you with doubts or anything you might have.

I think that making the bar of entry into Buddhism complete belief in orthodox Buddhism is misguided. It would be like judging Siddhartha by the standards of enlightenment before his awakening.

The Dalai Lama encourages people to embrace their native spiritual traditions with zeal rather than convert to Buddhism. We shouldn't want to keep such well-intentioned people from conversing respectfully with more traditionally-minded and knowledgeable Buddhists.

People come to Buddhism from all different backgrounds, often through very circuitous routes. No ones understanding will be perfect until they are fully liberated. So while it seems reasonable to point out perceived errors or differences in perspective, I think we should be focused on attempting to meet one another with both wisdom and compassion.

Rather than simply trying to right one another's views, I hope we can have an environment where people are free to ask any question they feel compelled to ask, and are responded to in an atmosphere or mutual respect and care.

Buddhism has a long and varied history, and I would rather use the perspectives it offers to illuminate and explore questions and issues than try to determine which is the ""correct"" Buddhism.

I don't want to call myself a Buddhist if its wrong to say that if I can't believe in the more 'fantastical' parts of Buddhism. Maybe it's my bias as a person in a Western world, but my upbringing in the Christian religion affected my ability to have faith in things that others have claimed. I feel like ""scientific materialism"" is a dirty word around here which disheartens me. So I guess it's time for me to move on. I appreciate what Buddhism has taught me and has allowed me to develop my own capacity for loving kindness and compassion for all beings, as well as helped me develop my meditation practice. It's helped me changed my outlook on life, and I'm generally a happier person for it. 

In any case, I appreciate all the advice many people on this subreddit have given me.

&gt; **Metaphysics** is a branch of philosophy concerned with explaining the fundamental nature of [being](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being) and the [world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World), although the term is not easily defined.

&gt; Traditionally, metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions in the broadest possible terms:  
&gt; 1. ""What is there?""  
&gt; 2. ""What is it like?"" 

&gt; A person who studies metaphysics is called a metaphysicist or a metaphysician. The metaphysician attempts to clarify the fundamental notions by which people understand the world, e.g., [existence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence), [objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy\)) and their [properties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(philosophy\)), [space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space) and [time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time), [cause and effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality), and [possibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possibility_(disambiguation\)).  

&gt; A central branch of metaphysics is [ontology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology), the investigation into the basic [categories of being](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_being) and how they relate to each other.

&gt; Prior to the modern [history of science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science), scientific questions were addressed as a part of metaphysics known as [natural philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy). The term science itself meant ""knowledge"" of, originating from [epistemology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology). The [scientific method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method), however, transformed natural philosophy into an [empirical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical) activity deriving from [experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment) unlike the rest of philosophy. By the end of the 18th century, it had begun to be called ""science"" to distinguish it from philosophy. Thereafter, metaphysics denoted philosophical enquiry of a non-empirical character into the nature of existence.

[You keep using that word, ""Metaphysics"".  I do not think it means what you think it means.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2y8Sx4B2Sk)

When I hear someone say ""I reject all of the metaphysics in Buddhism,"" I wonder what they mean by ""metaphysics"".  Then I wonder what they mean by ""Buddhism"".

Is the presentation of the [Four Noble Truths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths) anything other than metaphysics?  I do not think so.

Is the presentation of the [Three Marks of Existence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_marks_of_existence) anything other than metaphysics?  I do not think so.

Is the presentation of the [Five Aggregates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha) anything other than metaphysics?  I do not think so.

Are the presentations of [Anātman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta) and [Śūnyatā](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Śūnyatā) anything other than metaphysics?  I do not think so.

Are the presentations of [Karma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism), [Rebirth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_(Buddhism\)) and [Saṃsāra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saṃsāra_(Buddhism\)) anything other than metaphysics?  I do not think so.

1341488801.0,60,self.Buddhism,w2n01,I've been exploring Buddhism on and off for the past year or so and I'm struggling to understand it / see the point. ,ingredient_mosteroid,62,2,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/w2n01/ive_been_exploring_buddhism_on_and_off_for_the/,"As the title says. I'm in particular struggling to see how one could live a 'half-Buddhist' life, whereby they still participate in day-to-day activities as a 'lay-person'; this seems to be a lifestyle where the principles of Buddhism clash in a huge way against the typical Western materialist lifestyle. 

I find lots of Buddhism fascinating, and a lot of it does make sense to me (impermanence, anatta (no-self), compassion, non-dualistic principles, the present being the only reality). However there's a few things that completely put me off the practice or any deeper engagement with it:

- There seems to be some element of dogma implied in 'right' and 'wrong' view which seems to undermine the aim of seeing reality 'as it is'. If reality is visible beyond words and once we stop mindlessly thinking/using the monkey mind, surely there are many different routes or methods one can take to get to that same point, rather than 'the one true path'? This seems at odds with practices of tolerance and open-mindedness (you have to have an open mind, but follow these exact principles otherwise you'll never be enlightened!) In addition, the Buddha is referenced in Walpola Rahula's 'What the Buddha Taught' as describing the lifestyle of everyone else as 'low' and 'common' - which seems so derogatory and lacking in compassion as it was taught. Linking to what I said above, 'everyone is fighting a tough battle', and there's surely, logically, many routes to seeing what the Buddha saw in life.

- Enlightenment has been described as something where one doesn't 'become' enlightened, rather they simply uncover the truth or see it in full. I understand this. But again, in 'What the Buddha Taught', there is a reference made to the fact that 'there is nothing after enlightenment'. I don't understand how this makes sense in a world which is always changing and that even the state of mind associated with enlightenment will come to an end. The way it seems to be described, it is almost worded as if enlightenment was a cosmic switch that ensured you'd never return to dukkha - but if rebirth is how I understand it, you'd just be enlightened for the rest of your life. Is that it?

- What is the difference, in practice, between compassionate acts from someone who is enlightened, versus anyone else who just so happens to be a nice person (or even someone who understands non-duality/'we are all stardust', etc.)? I've heard it being described that 'compassionate' acts from someone who is not enlightened are not truly compassionate acts because they feed the ego, but surely the money donated to charity, or the time you went out there to help local communities, is of the same value regardless of your enlightened status?

- The ego, or lack thereof. I understand it in logical terms. But I don't see what use this knowledge has. I've gone through phases where I've thought - 'the Buddha WAS right, there IS no self', followed by two weeks of the deepest depression and de-personalisation. What's the point in doing anything at all if there is no self? Of looking for jobs. Of trying to help others (they're not real either!). Even if it is understood as 'there is no permanent self' - which makes more sense, I end up feeling guilty and overanalysing everything I do because 'that's just the ego talking'. I wind up with no self-esteem (if there's no self, there's no esteem!), no motivation to do anything, even helpful things. However, when I view it as 'if I help you, I help myself too, so everybody wins', I find peace and calm. Knowing that I have my own volition helps me out and I cannot, for the life of me, see how denying an ego helps anyone. Moderate the ego and it does a good job - but to deny it altogether? That's as if, seemingly, I'm already dead.

- Most of all, I feel, as a just-graduated young person with a life of many possible paths to take, that engaging fully with Buddhism is such a crazy risk. I do not want to feel, after 10 years of self-denial, sitting peacefully and acknowledging the truths of existence, that I have wasted my youth on something unprofitable. Life has many paths, and often it does not matter which small decisions are made in terms of overall happiness. But Buddhism as I understand it (and I'm sure I've completely misunderstood some things) seems like a huge gamble to make when full of life and health. I can only see it as useful when terminally ill, when a loved one has died, or when embracing death - there, you can probably find inner peace and comfort whilst waiting for death. But when full of life, youth and potential, and opportunities, love and sex, nature around me, billions of possible paths to fulfilment, the happy, the sad and the dukkha, opportunities for compassion and wisdom - why not just roll with it with an open mind, seeing first-hand how dukkha is supposed to work, until nearing death and having to accept 'okay, the game is up, I've had fun, let's learn how to let go now' - becoming a 'deathbed Buddhist'?

Apologies if I've offended anyone. I sincerely was not intending to, but am just pondering the big questions (as one does when their only other excitement of the day is looking for jobs). I look forward to hearing some differing opinions/thoughts.

as my comment history shows, I'm a declared anti-theist and I have criticised Buddhism on Reddit many times. As for Mr Lama, I respect his right to fight for his oppressed people, but religious robes on politicians simply aren't my cup of ginger tea.

But a part of my outlook is being open to re-examination, and recently I've been re-examining my attitudes towards Buddhism. I met some Chan Buddhists, and walked away intrigued. Then I read a few titles from this sub's list of recommendations, Mindfulness in Plain English, Zen Mind - Beginner's Mind, Siddhartha and so on - and found that they resonate with me. I recognized a lot of it as self-evident.

What I really like is the absence of a doctrine of sin, which I believe makes humans ashamed of being human, and so encourages moral rigidity and hypocrisy but discourages self-examination and self-improvement. 

So I'm here because I want to learn more, to see how you guys apply all this to your lives, but also to share my thoughts and get feedback. I'm not saying it would lead up to my becoming a Buddhist, but I'll keep my disagreements to myself or share them as politely as neutrally as possible.

I hope that's alright with you.

A major obstacle to sitting every day is - get this - not sitting every day. Days go by, the business of life sucks us in and then one day you find it's been months since you sat down on that cushion. (At which point self-flagellation commences.)

But if we look to almost any creative field, ""steady, daily practice"" is a lesson every good teacher imparts. Be it music or creative writing or learning to write software, one simply must practice every day. There is a **qualitative** difference between playing your guitar (or writing a story) 30 minutes a day for seven days and playing once a week for 210 minutes. 

The form, the rituals and the discipline of daily practice sharpen your skills. Practicing every day takes you deeper into the music. One learns to deal with the challenges of the day's practice regardless of the circumstances, the time of day, the weather or that simply unmissable show playing on TV. It's as if the act of simply respecting the daily schedule rewards you in some subtle, immeasurable way. (Yes, I know, rewards and attachments to rewards are very bad things.)

In the same way, I've come to appreciate the power of daily sitting. The very quality of my meditation has changed with daily practice. Sitting for 20 minutes a day for an entire week is **vastly** different from sitting for 30 minutes every other day. Committing to a daily routine makes it easy to sit which in turn makes you commit to a routine. 

So my big secret to steady, regular practice? Sitting every day. Who could have imagined?",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,,True,t3_mdlsx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/mdlsx/getting_so_much_better_all_the_time_daily/,

Noting is a helpful meditative technique that has its basis in MN 111, [One by One as They Occured](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.111.than.html).

If you aren't sure how to note, check out [this article](http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/books-articles/articles/mental-noting/), or [this one](http://www.shinzen.org/Retreat%20Reading/How%20to%20Note%20and%20Label.pdf). I really like noting, but it just doesn't vibe with some people, and it does take some time to get comfortable with. Your mileage may vary. Anyway, here she is:

**Noting The 4 Foundations of Mindfulness**

(More about the four foundations in the [satipatthana sutta](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.010.than.html).)

1. Set up a timer or bell to ring every 5 minutes. [Here's one](http://fungie.info/bell/). Sit for at least 20 minutes so you can get through all 4 foundations.
 
1. The Four Foundations you will be noting are **body sensations** (pressure, sitting, touching, warmth, tension, pain, etc.), **feeling tone** (pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral), **mindstates** (calm, quiet, aversion, concentrated, confused, observing, investigating, etc.), and **thoughts/mental images** (practice-thought, planning-thought, worry-thought, dinner, dog, tree [things you mentally picture]).

1. Basically you will note body sensations for 5 minutes, then switch to the next foundation when the bell rings, then the next, etc. If you haven't noted before just relax and trust yourself, don't get stressed trying to find the perfect label, and start slow. Noting, like everything else, gets very easy with practice.

**Why Do This?**

Your normal routine may be to quiet the mind, go beyond concepts, etc., so this may sound weird to you. Here's why I find noting awesome:

1. **Noting destroys narrative threads and makes ruminative thought almost impossible**. When noting I find I am distracted less since long neurotic strings of content-type stuff (my personal stories and anxieties) are simply reduced to disconnected sensations. Perceiving these sensations distinctly means they aren't weaving together into hypnotic stories. My thought loops and analysis regarding that girl I really like now become: tension, unpleasant, aversion, worry-thought, etc. 

2. **Noting builds concentration**. The nice thing about noting is that it's very obvious when you've become distracted (noting stops). Also, you're taking all of the energy of the conceptual, thinking mind, and diverting it to the technique, so it's much less likely to run off and do it's own thing. I find I can get very concentrated while noting, to the point where there are no gaps in my awareness of whatever sensations are arising, for long stretches of time.

3. **Noting works extremely well off-cushion.** If you are only mindful during your formal sits, that's not a good thing. Noting is something you can do pretty much any time of the day no matter what you're doing. This works wonders for building baseline mindfulness and concentration. If you're too busy to actually note, it still helps to constantly return awareness to one of the four foundations. Body seems to be the best for daily activities.

4. **Noting sets you up for insight into the three characteristics.** Learning to perceive the three characteristics in real-time is an ability that noting cultivates big-time. Amidst all of these flickering, impermanent sensations, which ones are associated with the self? Which with dukkha?

Those are just a few benefits. You can read more glowing reviews here: [The Benefits of Noting](http://thehamiltonproject.blogspot.com/2011/04/yogi-tool-box-benefits-of-noting.html).

Not because I feel that I am missing something by being atheist (meaning I do not have belief, not that I have disbelief), but because I admire the abstract interpretation of existence, the respect for life (or is it existence?), and the idea of awakening that are (at least in my mind) a significant part of Buddhism. But I have also read about things in Buddhism that seem far less... secular, I guess. Or maybe less logical.

For example, the concept of rebirth or reincarnation, and its implications for the existence of the soul. I am majorly put off by claims of the existence of the ""Five Realms"" and the ghosts and demons and titans and angels that reside in those realms and that each human may be reborn as. I'm not interested in that sort of thing. Expanding my consciousness and reaching higher levels of understanding, now *that* I'm all for, but I don't want the demons and angels and titans and releasing of spiritual energy to get in the way of that.

So my questions are:

* Is that what Buddhism is?

* I understand that Buddhism can be whatever you want it to be, but would I have to believe in the aforementioned things to be a part of a Buddhist community?

* Is Buddhism really compatible with atheism?
...Because I've been getting mixed messages about all of those.

*If my language or description of your beliefs was at all offensive, that is certainly not how I meant it. I am just trying to better understand Buddhism, and how it relates to my self.*

If we can't then we will tend to nihilism, delusion and ignorance.

For example, an empty jar is not the same as a nothing or nothingness jar. To say that the jar has ""nothing"" in it is false in all senses except in the ideal or conceptual way. A jar is never filled with ""nothing"", it's only not filled with the things we would expect but it's always filled with something (in the case of the earth, in above water conditions, it would mostly be air). This is why it's conceptual, because ""nothing"" only exists as a concept; in reality it doesn't exist, it's abstract and fictitious.

To understand void it's more easy if we see it as the hard drive of a computer. The hard drive represents space; in this space things come to manifestation (not existence because they neither exist nor not exist at this point, only they haven't manifested in any certain way). When we don't have information, the hard drive has zeros in it and it's useless for us; much like in space, when we don't have a particular manifestation of energy/existence-itself (say atoms), it's empty or void. But this doesn't mean the ""space"" isn't there, like in a hard drive that is empty it doesn't mean that it has no the space to write in information. So in this way, something might be empty, but not ""not-existent"" or ""nothingness"".

I hope this help you realise emptiness and void a bit more.

It's fun to ask: Why we can conceive nothingness? This is caused by the same capacity that grant us to accept falsity as truth. This is not as bad as it sounds, since without this we couldn't create things out of our own conception and there'd not be such thing as creativity! It's a very important base for consciousness, and it's also important part of our very own Buddha-nature since without it we would be conditioned to reality and our physical senses!",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,,True,t3_z1cb1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/z1cb1/dont_be_fooled_emptiness_and_void_is_not/,
1345409157.0,59,self.Buddhism,yhk7l,My Thoughts on Happiness,sirwolf,71,12,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/yhk7l/my_thoughts_on_happiness/,"I see a lot of people striving to be happy on this reddit. It might surprise you, but I have some thoughts.

Being happy is like holding water in your hands. If you cup your hands just so, don’t squeeze, it will stay there for a short while. But eventually it drains out. Happiness, like everything else, is transient. Worse, the more you strive for it, the more you cling to it the faster it dissolves. Like a butterfly, happiness comes along without bidding, is beautiful to see, fun to watch, but if you try to catch it, it dies. It is an accidental phenomenon. 

Happiness happens to us. We are happy when we are having coffee with a loved one. Or walking a favorite trail. But soon, Monday morning rolls around and there is no time for coffee or leisurely walks. And happiness dissolves. 

Instead of seeking happiness, seek joy.

But we can construct joy through truth. 

If you have ever felt joy, take a moment and really examine it. What is it made of? For me, joy is a combination of content and fulfillment. And we can get both of these through understanding the Dharma.

Contentment is simply the understanding that all is the way it should be.  If you understand that there is no time but now, you begin to see that nothing could be different than it is. Be content. Everything that has ever happened has led us to right here, right now. Therefore all is exactly as it should be.

Taking this a bit further, you could not be anything but what you are right here, right now. Be fulfilled with what you are right here, right now. You cannot be different.

I truly believe that everyone does the best they can, considering all that they know and all that they have experienced. This is why the Dharma must be brought to people. Even the Buddha had masters before he sat under the Bodhi Tree. I believe that you are doing your best, as well.

This does not mean that you should not do what you can at this point to become more skillful. That is the best you can do. We are all pointing our arrows toward targets. Those of us that are unskillful are pointing our arrows towards greed and hate and delusion. Those of us that are skillful are pointing our arrows towards generosity, love and clarity.",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,,True,t3_yhk7l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/yhk7l/my_thoughts_on_happiness/,

I realized I'm not really here, I just happen. I am a function of the universe and everything is just a function of the mind. Ever since then I've felt disoriented. If this is supposed to be a joyous realization I'm not getting it. I just feel dissociated and out of touch with reality, sometimes even a bit paranoid, and like I have no control over anything.

Now, throughout the course we were supposed to also be regularly meditating almost every day, but I very often neglected to do so. I didn't really see the point, often convinced myself I was too busy, and much more enjoyed just studying the philosophy.

What I am is inquisitive, and I was content with that until around a week ago when my entire view of reality shifted into a dark and terrifying place. I was a collector of knowledge, seeking it for the sake of knowing it. Spouting facts to anyone who would listen so they would think I was smart and that would mean something. But I still had a sense of incompleteness. The idea of deeper meaning is something I have always struggled with, and I pushed it aside (like we all do) because I was not prepared to accept the truth that the material world in which we live is merely a distraction from our true selves. 

Then, oh irony of all ironies, I began reading Victor Frankle's Man's Search for Meaning. Total devastation. The very last pages of the book discussed time, and how we should not pity the elderly because their reality has already been actualized. No more future potential but a lifetime of memories which are the true treasure. I could literally feel my brain fracture at this. Time: dates on a calendar in the past and in the future, always there, always concrete, is actually nothing. The future is an illusion, the past is an illusion, everything is an illusion. I fell into the rabbit hole and I know, viscerally, that there is no getting out. 

Now I am faced with two options as I see it. Option 1: step back from the precipice and medicate myself into the material world, living a life of depression, fear, loathing, and possible self-destruction. Or, Option 2: plunge myself even deeper into the rabbit hole. Truly let go of ""myself"". Dive into the unknown headlong until finding what lies beneath. People tell me this is a good thing. I am on the cusp of realizing my full potential as a human being. The word ""enlightenment"" is getting tossed around a lot. But why then does it feel like I've suddenly become a raving lunatic? 

I feel like I want to jump in and let go but I cannot fight the fear. How do I fight the fear? How do I grow from this before it totally destroys me?

It destroys itself. As a famous great Dzogchen master said spiritual practice is like sharpening a knife. When you sharpen a knife, two exhaustions happen. Exhaustion of the whetstone and exhaustion of the metal. And this double exhaustion is called a sharp knife. On the one hand we have emotions/delusions to deal with. The antidote to this emotion/delusion is compassion, meditation and discipline and so forth, but even these must be exhausted.

Gramps had a positive, kindly, humorous attitude. He was one of those very personable old folks. When asked how his day was going he replied, ""Great actually, I managed to stand up!"" Someone asked if he wanted the newspaper to which he responded, ""Only if you don't have any Playboys"" with a rascally smile. It's not what he said and did that mattered, it was how he went about it. He was cool. 

Thoughts arose about the taken for-grantedness of actions like standing, standing up, walking to and fro, running even. I even projected about how much he would give to be able to move freely like he once did. 

So many lessons here: Not wasting the opportunity to practice while still in youthful condition. The importance of conditions and codependent arising (due to the arising of old age and decay, frailty and infirmity of body and mind may arise).

Karma is action changing the universe, then universe changing action.

It's not cause and effect. It's similar... But similar is never quite enough.

It's not ""you killed someone, you will get killed"".

It's not ""I hate this person, something bad will happen to him"".

It's something deeper and clearer and more just.

When I hurt or heal the world around me, this world will change. This wave of changes will affect me as well, as it is my world. I can't make a wave in a pool and expect to never meet it's echo. Even if it's in the shore... Do all the waves you create never reach the other shore? Do they reach other people or boats or animals or plants or objects who then amplify and retransmit it?... This is also a way for it to reach and reach back.

Think about a parasite which gets shelter in your body, which is his world. If it kills you, it will eventually die if he can't find a ""new world"". If his bite or actions poison you, or make you get poisoned, he will get sick as well.

If there are two parasites and one harms more than needed your body and the other one doesn't stop it, by karma both will get detected and removed.

But if these parasites where to live in symbiosis, wouldn't them stop being a parasite? Wouldn't their actions change their world, and their world would change them? Wouldn't the world welcome them? Can one parasite act with such energy that it transforms other parasites and convince them to live in symbiosis?

Buddhas are the most supreme being in existence, an can be considered a teacher of humans and gods.---

---
The deva asked the Buddha if an arahant could use words that refer to a self:

    ""Consummate with taints destroyed,
    One who bears his final body,
    Would he still say 'I speak'?
    And would he say 'They speak to me'?""

This deva realized that arahantship means the end of rebirth and suffering by uprooting mental defilements; he knew that arahants have no belief in any self or soul. But he was puzzled to hear monks reputed to be arahants continuing to use such self-referential expressions.

The Buddha replied that an arahant might say ""I"" always aware of the merely pragmatic value of common terms:

    ""Skillful, knowing the world's parlance,
    He uses such terms as mere expressions.""

The deva, trying to grasp the Buddha's meaning, asked whether an     arahant would use such expressions because he is still prone to conceit. The Buddha made it clear that the arahant has no delusions about his true nature. He has uprooted all notions of self and removed all traces of pride and conceit:

    ""No knots exist for one with conceit cast off;
    For him all knots of conceit are consumed.
    When the wise one has transcended the conceived
    He might still say 'I speak,'
    And he might say 'They speak to me.'
    Skillful, knowing the world's parlance,
    He uses such terms as mere expressions."" (KS I, 21-22; SN 1:25)

""And -- thus my thought, oh exalted one, -- nobody will obtain salvation by means of teachings!

Siddhartha is the protagonist of the novel and he has come to the Buddha because of the stories surrounding this enlightened man.

Siddhartha is talking with the Buddha about staying with him to learn his teachings but Siddhartha is not very convinced that he can learn what he truly seeks. In a very eloquent tone the Buddha explains that he teaches salvation from suffering and nothing else. 

**Conversation before the quote:**

Siddhartha replies --
""I have not doubted in you for a single moment. I have not doubted for a single moment that you are Buddha, that you have reached the goal, the highest goal towards which so many [people] are on their way. You have found salvation from death.

When Elijah Wood was walking through a shopping mall he overheard a conversation between a sales rep and Lindsay Lohan.

""Give me the most expensive dress you have,"" said Lindsay.

""Everything in our shop is expensive,"" replied the sales rep. ""You cannot find here any piece of clothing that is not expensive.""

At these words Elijah became enlightened.

Unfortunately for him, I have made the decision to utilize his existence in my life as a symbol for everything I choose not to be.  Instead of reacting to his words and actions as he would like me to, I am now more prone to give him a simple nod, or contemplative 'hmm' or something completely neutral and without substance to show him that I am not amused, impressed, or willing to play along.  I refuse to get caught up in his toxic behavior and allow it to impact my attitude, how I behave treat others around me, or how I live my life.

With that, he and others like him are my teachers, and I am grateful for their daily lessons and inspiration as I continue on my path.

For example, statements like ""The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it"", ""Is any man afraid of change? Why what can take place without change?""
Or something like ""Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, sea-shores, and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much. But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul ""
