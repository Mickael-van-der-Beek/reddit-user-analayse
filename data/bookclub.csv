1339407209.0,116,self.bookclub,uvxki,Reddit Infinite Summer 2012,thewretchedhole,131,15,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/uvxki/reddit_infinite_summer_2012/,"Hi everyone, starting from June 21st /r/bookclub will become the forum for a 2012 version of [Infinite Summer](http://infinitesummer.org). What is Infinite Summer you ask? Well, over the period of June 21st-September 22nd, book lovers and masochists alike take part in reading the brobdingnagian^1 [Infinite Jest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest) by David Foster Wallace. 

Infinite Jest is set in an alternate reality America and is essentially about a movie that is so entertaining that anyone who watches it loses all desire to do anything but watch. It is a demanding book that requires some work from the reader, but I assure you it isn’t impenetrable, and the work you put in pays off. It is a deeply layered book from which any type of reader can find rewards. On the surface it is a socio-political novel that tries to describe how the modern world works, but at its heart it is deeply philosophical, and tells us what it feels like to live in this strange world of ours.  

The reading schedule (which can be found [here](http://infinitesummer.org/index)) allocates &lt;100pages a week. This is more than manageable to keep up with, but to be sure we will be posting weekly discussion threads to keep everyone up to speed. I understand the reading schedule won’t be for everyone, but i’m sure we’ll have fast readers and re-readers .etc. so everyone is encouraged to join in! This will essentially be a free for all, but of course, the golden rule^2 of bookclubs still applies.

Since we're only just beginning to read the book, I figure the best way to kick off discussion is by way of introductions. Who are you and what are your reading habits? Have you read IJ before, or any other DFW for that matter? And very importantly, how do you feel about spoilers?^1

Also, a little bit of trivia. The title Infinite Jest comes from Hamlet (scene V.1) where Hamlet is standing in the graveyard with Horatio holding the skull of his old household jester. It's a pretty grim scene about death and mortality and how we all turn to dust .etc.
&gt; Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite
jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath bore me on his back a
thousand times, and now how abhorr'd in my imagination it is!
My gorge rises at it.

Anyway, welcome again! I'm giddy like a schoolgirl. I'm looking forward to this. Here are some links that might come in handy along the way.

* [Our Kickstarter Campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1406680384/breakfast-with-strangers-50-meals-across-america)

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, 2012 we’ll hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME and all places in between (and then back). Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions, but our hope is that the conversation will continue long after the breakfast dishes are cleared. How? We’ll start here and see where it ripples out:

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration,

&gt; The Picture of Dorian Gray was a succès de scandale. Early readers were shocked by its hints at unspeakable sins and the book was later used as evidence against Wilde at the Old Bailey in 1895. Enthralled by his own exquisite portrait, Dorian Gray sells his soul in exchange for eternal youth and beauty. Under the influence of Lord Henry Wotton, he is drawn into a corrupt double life, where he is able to indulge his desires while remaining a gentleman in the eyes of polite society. Only Dorian's picture bears the traces of his decadence. A knowing account of a secret life and an analysis of the darker side of late Victorian society. The Picture of Dorian Gray offers a disturbing portrait of an individual coming face to face with the reality of his soul

&gt; The great Russian novelist Vladimir Nabokov once remarked that ""if Kafka's The Metamorphosis strikes anyone as something more than an entomological fantasy, then I congratulate him on having joined the ranks of good and great readers"" ([source](http://www.kafka.org/index.php?id=191,209,0,0,1,0)). Far be it for us to quibble with Nabokov. But you could say that Franz Kafka's story deserves its status as one of the greatest literary works of all time precisely because it's an awesome work of fantasy. It's a story about a man, Gregor Samsa, who wakes up as a gigantic, gross bug. Gregor's abrupt and unexplained transformation, along with the story's juxtaposition of everyday and fantastic elements, gives the story a dream-like quality that is enigmatically compelling.

The idea [snowballed](http://www.reddit.com/r/bookexchange/comments/1hzih3/send_want_george_orwells_1984/), and led to the creation of /r/TravelingBooks, a subreddit dedicated to the free, sequential exchange of community-owned books from one redditor to the next. Each new reader of a book is required to sign and date it before passing it on to a new person, thus giving us both the opportunity to share our favorite books with others, and the novelty of seeing where the book has been!

Any and all books are welcome to be shared, both in printed and audio format, in English or otherwise. I have offered up several of my own titles to get the sub off the ground, but we could definitely use some more enthusiastic people to willing to share their favorite books with the community!

So please come check out the new sub! If there's a book you've been waiting to read, or -- even better! -- if you have some good books that you'd like to share with the community, we have created a [short, simple guide outlining how to get started](http://www.reddit.com/r/TravelingBooks/comments/1i4529/official_rules_procedures_and_guidelines_for/).

I was hoping I could steal a minute of your time to let you know about a new book club subreddit I created a few days ago called the [Page to Screen Book Club](http://www.reddit.com/r/pagetoscreen)!

This book club specializes in books that have been or are being made into a film. If the movie has been released, we can choose to read the book first or watch the movie first. There will be discussion threads created for each avenue, and then after a week or two, a comparison thread will be made to discuss differences and similarities between the two versions. If the movie has not yet been released, we'll have only a discussion thread for the book, and then a thread for hypothesizing about the movie in regards to the book.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, please head on over to [r/pagetoscreen](http://www.reddit.com/r/pagetoscreen) and subscribe! I'd still like at least 1 more book nomination for October before we begin, so we'd love your help.

Let's talk about a Big Book we can read between June-August. 

Last year we did Infinite Summer and it was quite a success.

The date will be between these months but mostly depend on the size of the book/s. Can anybody tell me what time holidays'generally start over in America-land? 

The book will probably be chosen by some kind of external poll, something a bit more reliable than reddit. Goodreads is an easy one but not everyone will be signed up. Is there a 'Google Polls' or something that doesn't require a signup that anyone knows of? I'll narrow down the choices for the poll: popularity &amp; accessibility are key factors - after all, the more the merrier.

Please please please, **talk**. This is a *discussion*, not just an upvote/downvote book selection. Say if you like a suggestion or if it doesn't seem appealing or you've tried it and failed .etc. This is all taken into consideration. Decisions are made by those who show up.

Also, Ulysses is off the table. I wanna do that journey alone. 

Edit1: Sorry, I wasn't barring off the Russian masters. I was just saying that they intimidate me because all the characters have 500 different names. I can't believe no one has mentioned Dostoevsky. Which is kinda good because Karamazov gives me the heebie jeebies. 

**Edit2**: If I was going off this thread alone Book of the New Sun and Against The Day are the most popular. The other 'contenders' so far:

* War and Peace
* East of Eden
* Underworld
* David Copperfield
* Don Quixote
* Gormenghast Trilogy 
* Shogun
* Cryptonomicon
* Gravity's Rainbow

Most of all, it is a meditation on love--love as outrage and hallucination, madness and transformation

&gt; Joyce's semi-autobiographical chronicle of Stephen Dedalus' passage from university student to ""independent"" artist, is at once a richly detailed, amusing, and moving coming-of-age story, a tour de force of style and technique, and a profound examination of the Irish psyche and society.

&gt; Stephen Dedalus is a fictional alter ego of Joyce and an allusion to the consummate craftsman of Greek mythology, Daedalus.

&gt; A novel written in Joyce's characteristic free indirect speech style, A Portrait is a major example of the Künstlerroman (an artist's Bildungsroman) in English literature. Joyce's novel traces the intellectual and religio-philosophical awakening of young Stephen Dedalus as he begins to question and rebel against the Catholic and Irish conventions with which he has been raised.

Vote as to whether we start a new sub or just use a thread here? If new sub is wanted, would anyone be interested in ""prettying it up"", or would you all rather leave it as is?

Edit 2: So far we have 2 for making a new sub and 1 for staying on here with a thread until we get it out there.  The mods have replied and said that they would be OK with having a thread on here, or promoting a new sub for us. 

Edit 3: It seems like more people are interested in a separate sub.  I am going to make that really quickly.  In the mean time, look in the comments for a list of all SK books I currently have access to and reply with which you would prefer or upvote someone else if already listed.

The discussion throughout was fun and very enlightening. Personally, i'm already back to page 200 in my re-reading. I have fallen victim to the cyclical nature of this book.

Some questions for anyone who has finished the book:

1. Did you enjoy the book? Anything you particularly liked or disliked?

2. What did you think of the ending? What do you think happened in the year gap? Are there any loose ends for you? There's a couple of big unanswered questions for me: what happened to Hal? what happened to Gately? what went down between the AFR &amp; ETA?

3. What is the moral center of the book? What are some of the persuasive ideas/philosophies? Anything in particular you're fond of?

1373724648.0,24,self.bookclub,1i7umx,Here are some notes I have from reading Notes from Underground,Asian_Persuasion,27,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/1i7umx/here_are_some_notes_i_have_from_reading_notes/,"http://imgur.com/ekeyHqF

Note that I have more notes on the first part than the second since the first part does most of the philosophical work.

I've also finished The Orphan Master's Son from this month's reading if anyone wants to discuss that too.

EDIT: Added the text to the post -- I'm not sure why I didn't do that in the first place.

Part I

**""Now, I am living out my life in my corner, taunting myself with the spiteful and useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is only the fool who becomes anything.""**

I think there are a couple ways to take this. One is that an intelligent person is always trying to be something. He will always attempt to fit himself into some kind of category, even without thinking it. This intelligent person, having intelligence, would unwittingly do so because he is trying to take action on something. Even if that action is to try and do nothing, it is an action that is consciously taken and with a reason.

However, the fool will do whatever it is that comes to his mind. Because the fool does not limit himself to any category of being (i.e. he does not say he is a policeman, doctor, plumber, fool, etc.), he can become anything he wants to be. He is outside the categories of being that are set up in society and in people's minds. In this manner, the fool can be anything he wants to be.

The second way to look at this is that the intelligent man can't look at anything that is capable of him being (i.e. whatever profession is out there) in a serious manner. The intelligent person sees the absurdity in being anything (a la Camus) since to be anything in life is meaningless. The fool does not think in these terms (or has not thought this far/deep?) and will always try to be something. The fool does not realize the absurdity of life and strives for something that is inherently without any meaning.

**""Such a gentlemen simply dashes straight for his object like an infuriated bull with its horns down, and nothing but a wail will stop him.”**

I think, regarding the gentleman which he calls 'men of action' (non-existentialists), that the wall is supposed to be one's conscience. This wall is 'morally soothing', but for those that 'think and consequently do nothing', 'it is not an excuse for turning aside, an excuse for which we are always very glad, though we scarcely believe it ourselves, as a rule'. After typing this out, this actually seems kind of self-explanatory.

Actually, after further reading later on, I only seem to be partially right. The wall is not just a moral conscience, but includes the laws of nature (i.e. physics and mathematics). When a man of action reaches this wall, he cannot get over it because he is reconciled with it and deems it an impossible goal to overcome it. The existentialist will attempt to anyhow, because, in the mind of the existentialist, there does not exist a category of ‘impossible’.

**“’Possibly’, you will add on your own account with a grin, ‘people will not understand it either who have never received a slap in the face,’ and in that way you will politely hint to me that I, too, perhaps, have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life, and so I speak as one who knows.”**

I am pretty sure this ‘slap in the face’ is supposed to be some ultra-emotional event in life, an event that is probably devastatingly sad. However, Dostoevsky denies that an existentialist needs this to realize the absurdity of life.

**“[H]e knows better than anyone that he is only lacerating and harassing himself and others for nothing…and that he is only amusing himself like that from ill-humour, from malignancy.”**

I think that Dostoevsky’s spite and enjoyment derived from that spite arises from the reactions that rises from ‘men of action’ due to the existentialist’s own actions. The moaning existentialist knows that, to moan, is absurd, but he also knows that moaning makes the ‘men of action’ feel uncomfortable. He derives enjoyment from others not recognizing the absurd. It is almost like he is enjoying the feeling of control he has or that he is laughing at the world for not seeing what he sees.

**“Oh, gentlemen, do you know, perhaps I consider myself an intelligent man, only because all my life I have been able neither to being nor to finish anything.”**

Existentialism, coming from deep self-reflect, convinces one’s self that each goal that a person has (a “primary cause” in his words) isn’t as good as a goal that, after some more self-reflection, just appeared. This leads to a never-ending loop of moving the goal-post, leading to inaction.

Is this like: to be nothing, one is capable of being everything?

**“The only gain of civilization for mankind is the greater capacity for variety of sensations—and nothing more.”**

I suppose this is true, in its most abstract sense. However, I believe the argument for most people is that the sensations brought by civilization allow humans to reach a much greater height of…achievement? I’m not sure of the appropriate word there.

**“Consequently we have only to discover these laws of nature, and man will no longer have to answer for his actions and life will become exceedingly easy for him.”**

Isn’t this predicated on the assumption that humans do not make mistakes (not to mention that humans are completely rational actors)? Of course, I’m pretty sure he is arguing against this idea, but if you must make an argument, at least make it accurate.

**“One’s own free unfettered choice, one’s own caprice, however wild it may be, one’s own fancy worked up at times to frenzy—is that very ‘most advantageous advantage’ which we have overlooked, which comes under no classification and against which all systems and theories are continually being shattered to atoms.”**

So, Dostoevsky is saying that a person’s sense of instant gratification is on the top of everyone’s list of desires. I agree with him, up to a point. This sense of ‘unfettered choice’ is very strong and overrides any sense of society, long-term thinking, morals, ethics, etc., but it can be, and has been, overcome.

**“Indeed, if there really is some day discovered a formula for all our desires and caprices…then, most likely, man will at once cease to feel desire, indeed, he will be certain to.”**

I agree with this. Who wants to willingly make the wrong choice? What defines a human is their fallibility. Without that, what are we—a bunch of ungrateful Gods? The thing is, I don’t think there can ever exist a formula for human choice. How can you use logic and reason to predict non-rationality?

Or perhaps it would eventually get created - this formula - but the people that it will have been created for would be so different as to render them non-human by the standards of today. Essentially, by the time the formula will be made, I believe that the thought processes and decision-making of the future ‘humans’ will be so far advanced that it will be trying to visualize a 4th dimension. The formula can predict those humans, but not the current ones. Otherwise, with current human rationality, I don’t see how any human decision prediction can occur with any sense of certainty unless with such specificity as to render the formula useless for all people.

Or maybe this could actually be accomplished, but only on a large enough scale. So, pretty much Asimov’s Foundation is possible, but if limited to any individual scale, it is useless. In that case, and this is one that I can see being the most true out of the ones I’ve posited, Dostoevsky’s musings on science is non-applicable.

**“[T]here is one case, one only, when man may consciously, purposely, desire what is injurious to himself, what is stupid, very stupid—simply in order to have the right to desire for himself even what is very stupid and not bound to be bound by an obligation to desire only what is sensible.”**

Haha, so pretty much ‘fuck the police’. I can see this though. Even, if making a very stupid choice, the freedom allowed in doing so leaves it oh so satisfying. I think this is the essence of existentialism. It is the freedom to make decisions against any sense of category or structure, of any designation, -- this is to say, with the utmost freedom allowable. 

In his words: “[I]t preserves for us what is most precious and most important – that is, our personality, our individuality.”

**“In short, one may say anything about the history of the world—anything that might enter the most disordered imagination. The only thing one can’t say is that it’s rational.”**

Damn, this is an awesome fucking quote.

**“But how do you know, not only what is possible, but also that it is DESIRABLE to reform man in that way.”**

Doesn’t this depend on the context on which it is asked? He says that, since the journey can be more important than its destination, the actual goals of an action don’t always matter. However, this seems to only apply to a man that asks the question of advantage to himself. When asking the question in a third person perspective, it is the consequences that matter, not the process.

**“Does not man, perhaps, love something besides well-being?”**

Plato would say that this is impossible. How can you desire something that is not good? Even if you desire to suffer, you believe that this is good for you.

Part II

**“Only donkeys and mules are valiant, and they only till they are pushed up to the wall.”**

What does this mean? Only those that don’t think are valiant? Only those that are tools are valiant?

**“’Why dishonest? How dishonest? I was speaking sincerely last night. I remember there was real feeling in me, too. What I wanted was to excite an honourable feeling in her…Her crying was a good thing, it will have a good effect.’”**

It looks like he performed an almost ultimate form of deception. His desire to exercise power was so great that he derived feelings to fuel his speech to Liza just to give what he said the power to affect her. This guy is fucking committed.

**“And in my impatience I punched the sledge-driver on the back of the neck.”**

Lolwut? This was actually pretty funny just because of how ridiculous the action was.

**“It had happened that in my fury I did not even ask him what he wanted, but simply raised my head sharply and imperiously and began staring back at him. So we stared at one another for two minutes; at last he turned with deliberation and dignity and went back again for two hours.”**

Similar to the above, this scene is great through imagining it taking place. Even in his thoughts there is simply no context for the action.

&gt; “No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own.” Thus begins one of the most terrifying and morally prescient science fiction novels ever penned. Beginning with a series of strange flashes in the distant night sky, the Martian attack initially causes little concern on Earth. Then the destruction erupts—ten massive aliens roam England and destroy with heat rays everything in their path. Very soon humankind finds itself on the brink of extinction. H. G. Wells raises questions of mortality, man’s place in nature, and the evil lurking in the technological future—questions that remain urgently relevant in the twenty-first century.

I have [posted here before](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/k6bb4/help_me_out_with_solzhenitsyn/) asking for help on a project of mine I was starting: to read a book by the most representative author from every country, from 1900 to present day. I named the project *Clockwiselit* [by suggestion of redditor bovisrex](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/k6bb4/help_me_out_with_solzhenitsyn/c2huzvl). 

So, I promised updates and here's the first. I have started with Japan for no reason in particular, and the novel I chose is **1Q84 by [Haruki Murakami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami)**. He is without a doubt one of the most representative japanese writers of the second half of the XXth century and I am in love with his writing since I read ""Hardboiled wonderland"" a while ago. 

* 
**The Plot**
 
In Japanese, the letter *q* qnd the number *9* are homophones, they are both pronounced *kyu*, so 1Q84 is without being so 1984, a date of orwellian taste. This variation in spelling reflects the subtle alteration of the world in which the two characters of this novel live, which is, also without being so, Japan in 1984. In that world of normal and recognisable appearance live Aomame, an independent woamn who works as a gym instructor, and Tengo, a math teacher. They are both close to being 30, they both lead solitary and simple lives and they both perceive in their own way subtle disarrangements in their environment which will lead them inexorably to a shared destiny. And they are both more than it seems: Aomame is an assasin; Tengo an starting novelist whose editor has comissioned with the stealthy task of being a ghost writer for *""The chrysalis of air""*, an enigmatic novel put together by Fukaeri, a dodgy teenager. 

* **Some quotes**
 (My apologies for the broken english, but I read the book in spanish and translation is mine) 

""'1Q84, this is how I'm going to call this new world', Aomame decided. 'Q for Question Mark. The 1984 I knew does not exist anymore. This is 1Q84. The air has changed, the landscape has changed. I have to adapt quickly to the character of this world in the shape of a question mark. Like an animal freed in a new forest'.""

""That landscape to the other side of the window suggested the world was situated between ""the tragic"" and ""the absence of joy"" and that it was composed from the infinite accumulation of small worlds that acquire their very own shape.""


* **My opinion**

It had been long since I read a book that gave me goosebumps. Even though this book is almost 1000 pages and can be slow at times, the ending makes it worth it indeed. It is not an easy novel to read, both because of the complexity of its plot and because of how the author leaves most of the symbols in the novel unexplained and gives the reader the responsibility to find a meaning for them. The prose I can only qualify as delicate and delicious, and the personality of the main characters is carefully developed. It is one of those books that definitely need a re-read. 

**Next up: Korea! The book will be *""Please take care of mum""* by Kyung-Sook Shin.** 

*Please feel free to recommend me the most significant XXth century authors from your country and an interesting work by them!* 

Those I have already:

* Russia: Solzhenytsin's *A day in the life of Ivan Denisovich*. 
* Germany: Gunter Grass, *The tin drum*
* Canada: Margaret Atwood, *Blind Assasin*
* US: William Faulkner, *Light in August*
* Mongolia: Galsan Tschinag, *The blue sky*

They get all of their books from book drives, libraries, colleges and sell them for really great prices. It's about $10 for 3 books and they give you free shipping, and mail it in eco-friendly packaging.

Also, they donate most of the money to Global Literacy programs. They have donated over 8mil as of now. So if you are into buying books online maybe this would appeal to you.

The book I'm looking for is a book I read around the time I started high school (2002). It's fiction, and I'm not positive of the genre. Basically, it's a twisted love story. A girl is dating a handsome, talented young man. He lives in the bad part of town, and is very active in his school plays. She mentions somewhere that he reminds her of Elvis. 

Anyway, this young actor decides to play a trick on his girlfriend. He plays dead, so effectively that when he 'awakens' to confess his prank, she freaks out and kills him. I believe she stabs him. After this, she starts seeing him everywhere- at the basketball courts, all decayed. He's stalking her, I believe. 

I'm really looking for this book, it's one of the few I haven't identified yet. I'll post more details if I remember them.

Not a problem really.  CB is a cool guy.  Good as Batman *and* a psychotic NYC elite. 

What I first remarked upon reading the opening scene is that **it's written in a cinematic way**.  The author, Breat Easton Ellis uses phrases like fade to black or shatter frame to inside the cab.  It's an efficient way to make a segway(sp?) seeing as our culture is cinephilic (fancy way to say everyone watches movies). 

I love the way Ellis puts two sentences side by side to show us the mania that is the *Bateman's* mind.  He achieves a beautiful display minimalism when conveying so much (humor, character, truth) in these balanced sentences.

&lt;bold text is excerpt from the book&gt;

example 1:  Bateman is in the process of getting drunk at a dinner party.  He's had maybe 2-3 drinks and he only just arrived: **""I make myself another drink. I worry about the sodium level in the soy sauce.""**

example 2: Bateman comments on a dinner guest's appearance at that same dinner party: **""Stash’s admittedly cheap, bad haircut. A haircut that’s bad because it’s cheap.""**

It's also very interesting to consider Bateman's unique ability to size up what other people are wearing to a *T*.  The first thing he remarks about anyone worth talking to is what they are wearing and how they are wearing it.  Yet when he returns to his house he cannot even recognize the door man.  **""he could be anybody""**, is what he says.  This may indicate how drunk he is, but it's also interesting when contrasted against his encyclopedic like knowledge of socio-political issues as well as the cataloging of the possessions in his apartment.  He sounds like a god-damned infomercial! which is ironic because when he tries to fuck his fiance she turns on the TV and starts watching the shopping channel!!!

Finally, I noticed that reading this book makes me a little anxious and agitated.  It's not that I dislike the book (I like it in fact) but I think that the capricious nature of the characters in it may actually be *rubbing off on me*.  

Who the hell gets anxious about not having dinner reservations and then doesn't even flinch when the waitress brings the wrong appetizers to the table?   Apparently an American psycho does.

Cheers gentlemen, I hope you're enjoying the book.

The last really great non-fiction I've read is 'The immortal life of Henrietta Lacks' by Rebecca Skloot, about HeLa cells.  It horrified me to read about ethics towards early medical testing, and collection of human tissue.

I'm currently partway through 'The state of Africa' - I guess traditionally historical rather than just non-fiction, but incredibly interesting reading looking at the collapse and build of African nations post independence.

and life changing - while they are classified as fiction, both 'Schindler's Ark' and 'Slaugherhouse Five', opened my eyes, and made me want to read as much as I could about all sides of WWII.  Still haven't quite made it through a complete Antony Beevor though!

&gt; At its center are two sisters—Eri, a fashion model slumbering her way into oblivion, and Mari, a young student soon led from solitary reading at an anonymous Denny’s toward people whose lives are radically alien to her own: a jazz trombonist who claims they’ve met before, a burly female “love hotel” manager and her maid staff, and a Chinese prostitute savagely brutalized by a businessman. These “night people” are haunted by secrets and needs that draw them together more powerfully than the differing circumstances that might keep them apart, and it soon becomes clear that Eri’s slumber—mysteriously tied to the businessman plagued by the mark of his crime—will either restore or annihilate her.

&gt; After Dark moves from mesmerizing drama to metaphysical speculation, interweaving time and space as well as memory and perspective into a seamless exploration of human agency—the interplay between self-expression and empathy, between the power of observation and the scope of compassion and love.

So what I'm asking, what are your favorite books from African authors written in the Postcolonial period or later? I'm looking for North African books but clearly I've already gone a bit sub-Saharan with Adichie. Look forward to hearing your suggestions!

It's not that the universe isn't interesting, quite the opposite, the universe of Imajica is strange and wonderful. It's the characters I can't stand. I don't like or engage with all four of the main characters;

* The woman Judith is portrayed as a philandering whore who only wants to go on adventure because Gentle is.
* Gentle is a man-whoring sellout and all round shit person.
* Charlie tried to hire an assassin to kill Judith. Enough said.
* Pie is an androgynous mystif with untold power, who decided to hang out on Earth and kill people for shits and giggles.

the only good character in the book got killed off 100 pages later. I just can't engage with any of these characters, therefore I don't care about them and can't bring myself to continue reading this book.

&gt; A gripping and entertaining tale of terror and suspense as well as a potent Faustian allegory of hubris and science run amok, The Invisible Man endures as one of the signature stories in the literature of science fiction. A brilliant scientist uncovers the secret to invisibility, but his grandiose dreams and the power he unleashes cause him to spiral into intrigue, madness, and murder. The inspiration for countless imitations and film adaptations, The Invisible Man is as remarkable and relevant today as it was a hundred years ago

As you might have noticed, the books we tend to read in bookclub are often well known classics that many people have read. Many of the books we choose people (read: americans) have read because of their high school curriculum. 

But every now and then we need a bit of *variance*. We always get a few 'unknown' books submitted but they never get any votes. So I figure the best way to do this; rather than leave it to the democratic free-for-all we normally use, is to start a new thread asking to see who's interested in doing it, and for suggestions of some lesser known books we can talk about.

Leave a comment with the title, author and a brief synopsis. Maybe a few reasons why you think it's worth talking about?

I am reading World War Z the book and was at the North Korean/South Korean chapter. Up until this point of the book I had been pleasantly surprised at how accurate and realistic Max Brooks portrayal of a Zombie event was. (I mean yes except for the whole Zombie part.) After reading what happened to North Korea, I was just shocked at how stupid that part sounded! Come on how can you hide that many millions of people underground? What about food and water supplies, waste management? Just the logistics of such a thing is mind boggling. 

I guess you could argue that maybe it was meant to be a temporary thing and the fact that the North Koreans haven't emerged in this long must confirm the idea that they are now all a trapped underground Zombie army. But that just brings up another thing that has bothered me about the book. I know we are supposed to accept that Zombies are real to read this book but it felt almost jarring to read a book that seems so realistic in its portrayal of a mass panic caused by Zombies only to keep dismissing how stupid the Zombie idea is. 

I mean why not create a Zombie that will need some energy source. If the Zombies don't attack each other and like in the North Korean example are all stuck underground then how did they survive for ten years? I guess what I am saying is that reading this chapter took me out of the book world and brought me back to reality. It just didn't fit.

Together they spent long afternoons listening to her father's record collection. But when his family moved away, the two lost touch. Now Hajime is in his thirties. After a decade of drifting he has found happiness with his loving wife and two daughters, and success running a jazz bar. Then Shimamoto reappears. She is beautiful, intense, enveloped in mystery. Hajime is catapulted into the past, putting at risk all he has in the present.

&gt; The novel focuses on the Joads, a poor family of sharecroppers driven from their Oklahoma home by drought, economic hardship, and changes in financial and agricultural industries. Due to their nearly hopeless situation, and in part because they were trapped in the Dust Bowl, the Joads set out for California. Along with thousands of other ""Okies"", they sought jobs, land, dignity and a future.

**Themes**

* Industrialisation &amp; obsolete trades
* Personal dignity
* Good and evil / right and wrong (by proxy, criminality .etc.)
* Corporatism and the amassing of wealth at the expensive of others (a fair bit of socialist ideology is shining through, not really in policy, but in the anti-capitalism)
* Mobility
* Homelessness
* The importance of family
* Birth/rebirth/new beginnings

&gt; 
Of all the contenders for the title of The Great American Novel, none has a better claim than The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Intended at first as a simple story of a boy's adventures in the Mississippi Valley-a sequel to Tom Sawyer-the book grew and matured under Twain's hand into a work of immeasurable richness and complexity. More than a century after its publication, the critical debate over the symbolic significance of Huck's and Jim's voyage is still fresh, and it remains a major work that can be enjoyed at many levels: as an incomparable adventure story and as a classic of American humor.

I believe that by giving everyone a fair amount of time (two weeks), and then having a discussion, we will have a more fruitful discussion with more people contributing, and no comments left without attention.

&gt;‘Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav’n …’

&gt; In Paradise Lost, Milton produced poem of epic scale, conjuring up a vast, awe-inspiring cosmos and ranging across huge tracts of space and time. And yet, in putting a charismatic Satan and naked Adam and Eve at the centre of this story, he also created an intensely human tragedy on the Fall of Man. Written when Milton was in his fifties – blind, bitterly disappointed by the Restoration and briefly in danger of execution – Paradise Lost’s apparent ambivalence towards authority has led to intense debate about whether it manages to ‘justify the ways of God to men’, or exposes the cruelty of Christianity.",,False,,t5_2qktu,False,,,True,t3_srkz0,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/srkz0/discussion_paradise_lost/,

However, I think a monthly book is too little and a weekly book is too hard for many people. The sweet spot, I think, would be one book every two weeks, as it already says in the sidebar (Every month, we choose a couple of books). I know there's the two-books-a-month thing here with one Gutenberg book and one Modern book, but those aren't spaced-out over two weeks and thus there

What does the /r/bookclub think of this idea? I know there's stagnancy in the subreddit. A better idea, I think, would be to trade off: Two weeks of a modern book and two weeks of a Gutenberg book.

So I am nearing the end of a project that I hope may be of interest to some of you out there. I am a professional musician, and just over a year ago, after reading Canadian author Ami McKay's novel ""The Birth House"" that it would be a fun and interesting idea to create a concept album inspired by the characters, themes, and landscape of this story. I know that book-inspired albums have been released in the past, but this album was meant to follow the story arc, and ultimately be a companion to the story, while also retaining universality in the themes, allowing the songs to stand on their own.

So, along with my S.O., we decided to begin writing and over the course of the next year wrote and recorded 13 original songs that make up the album ""Creation."" Our band name is Arosa Star, and production on our album will be finishing in the next month or so. To make a long story short we visited Ami McKay, who lives on the east coast of Canada, and brought her a demo of the album this past summer. She loved the idea and the songs, and we are now working towards continuing this collaboration. To read about the story of our visit, check out her blog at www.amimckay.com. 

If you are curious for more info about the project or to hear some music, we have a website at www.arosastar.com. I am genuinely curious to hear what the literary community thinks of this concept.

Link: [r/NPBC](http://www.reddit.com/r/NPBC)

Although it's called the Neuropsychology Book Club because 'neuropsychology' is easy to appreviate, I hope this venture will be of interest to anyone interested in clinical, cognitive, or social psychology; education and/or development; cognitive science; neuroscience; and any related disciplines.

It should also be of interest to fans of popular-science books, as well as people who have, or like, brains. All books chosen will be books written for the layperson, unless there is a huge clamoring for a more technical book, and books will be selected based on suggestions and votes from the members. In general the reading rate will be 1 book per month, like a traditional book club (at least until we see how this goes and adjust the pace accordingly).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first book up, based on redditor suggestions, will be **Jonah Lehrer's [How We Decide](http://www.amazon.com/How-We-Decide-Jonah-Lehrer/dp/0547247990/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1278874230&amp;sr=1-1)**. Jonah is the author of the excellent blog [The Frontal Cortex](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/about.php) and also the author of *Proust was a Neuroscientist*. Please see the link for the amazon.com editorial review and a Q &amp; A with the author.

The discussion will get started on or around July 15, to give everyone some time to buy, download, beg, borrow, or pirate a copy and start reading. Hopefully, the discussion will continue for a few weeks, until it's time to move on to the next book, which will be [Switch](http://www.amazon.com/Switch-Change-Things-When-Hard/dp/0385528752/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1278874270&amp;sr=1-1) by Chip and Dan Heath (books after that are wide open to suggestion).

I'm hoping that this will be a fun, free-wheeling discussion that will take on a life of its own, but to get things started, I will be posting some discussion questions every few days or so as needed, and I will also try to link companion articles (like any studies talked about in the text) over in [r/Neuropsychology](http://www.reddit.com/r/neuropsychology) for interested readers.

(BTW, my fervent hope is that I'll be just another reader in the NPBC, but in case you're wondering who I am and just exactly what makes me think I should start a book club, here's what I bring to the table:

* I'm a [pediatric neuropsychologist](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ak9ne/i_am_a_neuropsychologist_ask_me_almost_anything/) (slow link)
* I read lots and lots of pop sci books and NP textbooks
* I like brains and brain-related things, like neuroanatomy and zombies
* I know some other psychologists IRL, and have convinced at least a few of them to join the NPBC to add context, expertise, opinions, etc.)",,False,,t5_2qktu,True,,,True,t3_cod9h,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/cod9h/announcement_and_invitation_the_neuropsychology/,

&gt;The house looked right, felt right, to Dr Louis Creed.

&gt;Rambling, old, unsmart and comfortable. A place where the family could settle; the children grow and play and explore. The rolling hills and meadows of Maine seemed a world away from the fume-choked dangers of Chicago.

&gt;Only the occasional big truck out on the two-lane highway, grinding up through the gears, hammering down the long gradients, growled out an intrusive threat.

&gt;But behind the house and far away from the road: that was safe. Just a carefully cleared path up into the woods where generations of local children have processed with the solemn innocence of the young, taking with them their dear departed pets for burial.

&gt;A sad place maybe, but safe. Surely a safe place. Not a place to seep into your dreams, to wake you, sweating with fear and foreboding...

The creator and workhorse /u/Aragorn_Telcontar was on a bit of a hiatus and the discussions stopped for a while.  But the good news is he's back and the discussions will be starting again this Saturday!

The chapter will be picking up from where we left off. ""The Bridge of Khazad-dum"" (a little more than halfway through *The Fellowship of the Ring*).  So you have plenty of time to catch up.  

Whether you are a Tolkien fan or never read his work before you are most welcome. Even some of you Tolkien veterans will probably have think about it a bit more critically than you normally do and may learn some things. And besides, if you are already a Tolkien fan, shouldn't you just be itching for an excuse for a reread?

Anyway, I'm just trying to get the word out.  The more people who participate the better it will be of course.

Also, if you are familiar with Tolkien (or just ambitious) we could use some people to help out with chapter summaries and discussion points.

So much to cover, so much to detail to go into. Where do we begin? Let's start easily and say what was most enjoyable about the book.

Personally I loved so much about this: the characters, the misdirection, the deep underlying themes in relation to what we consider our own personal ""gods"" and how quickly those ideas can be cast out. I find it fascinating to think from their point of view. There were several confusing part ie. the interludes, the coming to america sketches. I understand they brought insight to how certain gods were formed and brought over, but it didn't feel necessary to the overall plot. Also, the climactic moment ""backstage"" where shadow ends the battle of the gods, was almost too familiar. Gaiman, along with pratcher, did something very similar in good omens with the antichrist. Some recurring endings i suppose.

Finally, it leaves me with a few questions, what is waiting for shadow in america? why did the coin hang in the air at the end? Who did mad sweeney take the ""special"" gold coin from? And there were two odins, one in iceland and one in america?

So what do we think of Addie? She's kind of the main character, right? Her dialogue consists of barking a few words at Cash out the window and the single chapter after she's dead, but she's the plot driver and the story is named for her. She *is* the story.

Also, as a sidenote, isn't it funny how so much of the book can be interpreted in different ways? When I underline quotes and re-read them, they mean something completely different out of context. The style of the narrative &amp; vernacular of the Deep South seem to make everything explode with meaning. Example:

*""That was when I learned that words are no good; that words don't ever fit even what they are trying to say at... [Anse] had a word, too. Love, he called it. But I had been used to words for a long time. I knew that that word was like the others: just a shape to fill a lack.""*

Seems like a meditation on our individualism &amp; subjectivity, or philosophy of language and generally that words can't fully describe life experience. But in context, she's seems to be talking about womanhood/motherhood/love. Which is the major preoccupation for all the female characters.

Here's my favourite quote from the chapter: *""And so when Cora Tull wouild tell me I was not a true mother, I would think how words go straight up in a thin line, quick and harmless, and how terribly doing goes along the earth, clinging to it, so that after a while the two lines are too far apart for the same person to straddle from one to the other; and that sin and love and fear are just sounds that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forget the words. Like Cora, who could never even cook""*

I liked the little stab about Cora's cooking (which is clearly an important apart of womanhood, since the first woman to speak in the book is Cora talking about how she baked some cakes--cakes inferior to Addie Bundren's, obviously).

But anyway, this chapter is pretty brutal. She hates her children, although this might just be a resignation of life in general. She innately knows her love for Cash, but when she had Darl she felt deceived by Anse and his word 'love'. So her reaction is to take revenge, and the revenge for her is that they will never know she was doing it. This isn't entirely the reason all these people are fucked up, but it certainly plays a big part. Cora &amp; Darl also point out in their narratives that Addie is partial to Jewel, (I don't really know why, maybe she appreciates that he's a gaping asshole) but  mostly she feels like motherhood is the best way to live life until you make it to the grave. As her father always said:

*""I could just remember how my father used to say that the reason for living was to get ready to stay dead a long time""*

Also, there was a paragraph at the end which still doesn't make sense to me:

*""I gave Anse Dewey Dell to negagtive Jewel. Then I gave him Vardaman to replace the child I had robbed him of. And now he has three children that are his and not mine.""*

How, and why? I don't get it. To be honest, there were lots of things I didn't get.",,False,,t5_2qktu,True,,,True,t3_pqff7,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/pqff7/my_mother_is_a_fish/,

Do you think banning is wrong?
If not, what would you consider substantial grounds for a banning? 
- my thing with that is that banning seems to be (in my opinion) a violation of the first amendment but also a violation of privacy (in my opinion it should be up to parents to censor what their children read, just like it is what food they eat or what time they go to bed.), freedom of religion, belief, a lot of things. It really does tie into a lot of categories.

I started reading this at the beginning of the month but I keep putting it down and reading other books. I've only just arrived at pg. 110 (A Goddess in the Bath). The story and characters are good and the prose in particular is great. But something isn't pulling me in. I thought at first maybe it was because I can't get a good visual in my head of the dense and sprawling snowy New York. (I've been watching Woody Allen and other NY-based movies to try and get some solid pictures in my head).

Even though i'm making slow progress, it's still a good book. I just can't get myself immersed in it. I think maybe i'm not being patient enough with the writing.

&gt; One of William Faulkner’s finest novels, As I Lay Dying was originally published in 1930 and remains a captivating and stylistically innovative work. The story revolves around a grim yet darkly humorous pilgrimage, as Addie Bundren’s family sets out to fulfill her last wish: to be buried in her native Jefferson, Mississippi, far from the miserable backwater surroundings of her married life. Told through multiple voices, it vividly brings to life Faulkner’s imaginary South, one of literature’s great invented landscapes, and is replete with the poignant, impoverished, violent, and hypnotically fascinating characters that were his trademark. 

**Themes**

Death and mortality / Subjectivity, isolation and identity / Humans as social animal / The rich &amp; the poor (country vs. town folks)  / Words vs action; or perhaps language and meaning? / Motherhood and womanhood / Sin and duty / Sanity and insanity

This is, of course, perfectly understandable. It's a great big brick of a novel, it flaunts Pynchon's breadth of knowledge at every opportunity, and it makes very few admissions to such trifling matters as readability or narrative coherence. HOWEVER, I would enjoin anyone who is interested in contemporary or late 20th century literature to give this book another go, even if it has felt like a chore in the past, and I may be able to give some reasons why it is worth doing so. Here, in other words, is my defence of Pynchon, and by extension an entire generation of postmodern American writers:

Towards the end of GR, there is, apropos of very little, a complete reading of Colonel Blicero's tarot. This might seem bizarre or digressive in any other narrative context, but in a novel which rarely stays in one genre for more than a few pages, it reads simply as another inquisitive offshoot. The reason I mention it is not because it is a remarkable passage per se, but because it momentarily distils the mercurial narrative voice into something unambiguous, which nevertheless maintains the same intent which it has held through the entire novel theretofore. 

In short, this is a novel about people trying to find meaning in a sequence of opaque signs.

A little earlier Slothrop has looked at a newspaper with an image of the mushroom cloud hovering above Hiroshima and seen it as a huge nebulous cock plunging into the ground. He is a man whose life has been defined by his libido - and its perversely contra-temporal relationship with the V2 - and so when he is confronted with this sign, whose import is beyond the capacity of man to understand, he parses it in his own profane terms. There is a scientific explanation of the reaction cascade which takes place inside an atomic bomb, much as there is a set of engineering principles which governs the operation of a V2, but nobody has ever understood the Bomb. No human mind has ever been able to contain the loss which is effected by a weapon of such absurd power. And yet we live in a post-atomic age, and Pynchon was writing in a time when the threat of planetary annihilation was more immediate than at any other point in human history. It's easy, and possibly specious, to see all literature written during the cold war in these dystopian terms, but GR is a book which is intimately concerned with the practicalities of warfare, and hence brings more readily to mind notions of international combat and the vulnerability of the individual. Having read so much about the fearsome power of the rocket over both the physical and psychic world, there is little which we can imagine at this point, except that we are quite roundly fucked by the advent of the Manhattan project. The natural, and perhaps inevitable, reaction of any human being to such circumstances can only be ""what does this mean?"" 

Naturally, Pynchon offers no answers. No great writer offers answers, only clarifications of the question, and perhaps some sympathy for those who oppose your preconceptions of what the answer might be. Slothrop is identified over and over again as a paranoiac, one who sees the operation of the incorporeal Them in every situation he finds himself in, and Pynchon never quite lets us know whether the world the reader sees - in which his paranoid delusions are entirely justified - is the true reality, or merely one distorted through the lens of his egotism, but the eventual effect of the book must be to ridicule any attempt to locate patterns of providence or justice or even logic in the events which ensue. In The Zone, the post-war, post-state, post-moral realm of confusion and madness, entropy is the the only law, dictating that order must eventually give way to chaos. There are many characters, many factions, many plots and subplots in GR, but their disparate threads are all interwoven by a single abstract intent, which is encapsulated by Blicero's tarot. Everybody wants to know what plan the world is moving in accordance with, because it is inconceivable that such horrific destruction as was visited on the Earth by the war and the Bomb was at the behest of a few fallible, venal human beings.

Many people read T.S. Eliot's *The Waste Land* as an explicit response to the First World War, as a question of how the Christian values which ostensibly governed Europe could have given way to the inhuman chaos which ensued. In my view, GR is an equivalent statement on the Second World War, and it is worth reading for that reason alone. There's no denying that it's a difficult novel, which at times seems intentionally alienating, but I think that if you consider it in the above terms, as a piece of narrative art which demonstrates the futility of applying former systems of value or significance to modern warfare, it is far easier to comprehend.",,False,,t5_2qktu,False,,,True,t3_1kdr60,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/1kdr60/gravitys_rainbow_for_the_lost_the_forgotten_and/,

The quote at the beginning of the book chrysalises this theme:  *""And as things fell apart Nobody paid much attention""* -[The Talking Heads](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=068AFYvd58E)

**Most Surreal Moment:**  *I should preface by saying that I haven't seen the movie but I did imagine *Christian Bale* as Patrick Bateman throughout the whole book (for better or for worse).*

In this scene Patrick's writer friend spots him in a hip restaurant: 

&gt;“Daisy! And Patrick, you devil!” Francesca screeches. “Daisy, what in god’s name are you doing with a stud like Batman?”

I chuckled. 

**Funniest Moment:** 

&gt;After he says, “Hey Davis,” I inexplicably start listing the names of all eight reindeer, alphabetically, and when I’ve finished, he smiles and says, “Listen, there’s a Christmas party at Nekenieh on the twentieth, see you there?” I smile and assure him I’ll be at Nekenieh on the twentieth and as I walk off, nodding to no one, I call back to him, “Hey asshole, I wanna watch you die, motherfuck-aaahhh,” and then I start screaming like a banshee, moving across Fifty-eighth, banging my Bottega Veneta briefcase against a wall. Another choir, on Lexington, sings “Hark the Herald Angels” and I tap-dance, moaning, in front of them before I move like a zombie toward Bloomingdale’s, where I rush over to the first tie rack I see and murmur to the young faggot working behind the counter, “Too, too fabulous,” while fondling a silk ascot. He flirts and asks if I’m a model. “I’ll see you in hell,” I tell him, and move on. 

**Best Moment of Self-Reference:**

&gt;essentially pigeons with the heads and tails of rats—found deep in the center of Harlem and now making their way steadily toward midtown. A grainy photograph of one of these things accompanies the article, but experts, the Post assures us, are fairly certain this new breed is a hoax. As usual this fails to soothe my fear, and it fills me with a nameless dread that someone out there has wasted the energy and time to think this up

Just as Bateman was distrubed by some weirdo imaging up rat-pigeon hyrbids, I found myself uneasy with Bret Easton Ellis during some of the more gruesome parts of the book.

I admit I did skim over various sections of the book which I found unreadable:  the violent torture scenes, the lists of electronic equipment, the discussions of popular 80's music (though, I have since added 'Whitney Houston' to my Mp3 player).

Skipping parts of books would usually seem reprehensible but I feel like the author would condone it with this supporting passage: 

&gt;It’s as if her mind is having a hard time communicating with her mouth, as if she is searching for a rational analysis of who I am, which is, of course, an impossibility: there … is … no … key.

There is no key to understanding this book.  The Music description scenes are just there to distract.  It's all just a weird Salvadorian Bistro.  A living hallucination.

Discussion will focus on the bigger picture, which will allow for more participation, because no one actually has to go read the book.

Bigger-picture discussions will allow us to, maybe, draw more subscribers, who want to partake without having to commit. Finally, with more readers, we can eventually focus on the details of the books of the month. 

Basically, before we ask people to commit, we have to prove we are capable of insightful and fun discussion.

Large spoilers following so if you haven't finished the book, you have been warned!

Smerdyakov is one of my favorite characters from the book.  One of my main questions about him is, what exactly was his motive for murdering Fyodor Pavlovich?  I guess he didn't really want the money as he didn't do anything with it.  Was the money the motive, then he just felt remorse after committing the murder?

I know Ivan was a large influence, was it the corruption from him and his ""everything is permitted"" philosophy?  If it was from this influence, it seems like pretty straight up malice from Smerdyakov.  What else could influence his will to murder his master?  Fyodor Pavlovich was a pretty big dick, but he took a big liking to Smerdyakov.  

I'll have to reread some of these sections.  I'll try and get some more developed thoughts out if people are interested in responding. These are very fresh questions/ideas after finishing the novel.

So, over in [1] /r/stephenking , I posted an idea. Before I paste that topic here, I have just a couple things to say.

I initially didn't think to post here because my idea will involve all of king's books, not only DT ones. I'm guessing there is a reason that you are subscribed to this subreddit and not the other, but maybe you just do not know it exists.

The Dark Tower books would be included in books that we can discuss for the week, as selected by the votes. I recently finished the series myself and would love individual discussions on them.

Here is the copy paste.

So, I just finished reading Misery, and was interested to come on here and see old discussions on the book. Well, a quick search of ""Misery"" brought up nothing at all. I was slightly disappointed. This led to me having an idea.

What if, every week, we were to create a [discussion] topic about a particular book. Every week, we would discuss parts of that book, help other people remember reading it, and then perhaps we could also post a comment in that topic that said our vote for next week was whatever book we wanted.

Then, at the end of that weeks discussion, someone could tally up the votes and create the new topic.

It would be easy to avoid spoilers, simply post a spoiler tag in the topic title and then if you have not read the book and do not want to be spoiled, stay out of the topic!

If this idea take off, which I kinda hope it does, I would like to humbly suggest that the first book we discuss is either Misery or It, since I have very recently read both of them.

What does everyone think?

I've already gotten a few comments (all positive) about the idea, so if you guys like it too, then upvote this, comment it with ideas, or whatever to make sure a bunch of people see it.

If you are interested, head over to [2] /r/stephenking and subscribe, as well as help the topic along there.

Say Thankya Big-Big

What a great story. I don't really know how to talk about it without spoiling it. It's so short, so fast paced. Basically, it's a shipwreck story told from the POV of Edward Pendrick; not a particularly likeable character. He gets stranded on the island of one Doctor Moreau, a scientist with some suspect practices. It reminded me a lot of The Tempest.

(Note: spoilers) For those that have read it: that **ending**!! The last chapter was so amazing, and the last paragraph just blew me away. (as you can tell by the quote)

I don't know really know what to talk about. There were so many themes but most of them weren't very explicit. Obviously ideas about evolution/regression and pain/cruelty were at the forefront. I think I lilked the religious (read: blasphemous) ideas the most. Moreau as God, the House of Pain, the Beast-Men hovel as a kind of Eden with the forbidden fruit, the Trinity (the three M's).

The 3rd person perspective of this book casts the story of the American dream underneath an overly romantic lens of ambition.  For instance, Clyde's fascination with good clothes and mimicry of people he idolizes are always portrayed in terms of how they will better him to need and want more.  However, I wonder about Clyde underneath this lens; he's not an embodiment of ambition, as his Christian background impedes his progress and sways his ambitions heavily. He can only slowly escape his nervousness around women and is subject to shyness and insecurity around them; he also just barely bottles his excitement in having friends and going about town with them. The ambition lens portrays all his experience robotically as stages in the next step; is this actually who Clyde is after years of only dreaming and being sheltered from life's pleasures, or is this simply the focus and drama of the novel putting the story into a meaningful and interesting perspective?",,False,,t5_2qktu,False,,,True,t3_hbj8k,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/hbj8k/an_american_tragedy/,

It was written simply but confidently, and focused on themes of love, tragedy, and fate. So heart-wrenching!!

Synopsis: Having survived the loss of his mother and an abusive father, all Jebediah (Jeb) Creaven wanted in life was a steady job, a pretty girl, and the prospect of a good life ahead. When that life comes crashing down around him, he knows it is time to get out of town. A lumberman by trade, Jeb takes the next steamer out of Saginaw to the wilds of northern Michigan, where endless pine forests and prosperity are waiting.

And, once in Beaver Bay, Jeb’s new life appears to have everything — new friends, a new job, new forests, and even a new romance. But it also brings with it a life-threatening illness, a deadly rival, and a mysterious woman who seems to always be just outside of Jeb’s vision. Will Jeb ever get the life he has been longing for?

Yes, I know. White males have written a lot of excellent literature and most of what is known as the classics. That's 'cause they have been the most literate and educated during the past 1000 years. There is nothing wrong with reading books by them.

BUT. Folks, it is good for the mind to get different viewpoints. Now, you may argue, that these fantastic white males write often from the viewpoint of women or people of different ethnic backgrounds. And sometimes they do a good job at it. But women and non-caucasians have a voice of their own and you may learn something by listening to it. And they have written some damn good books as well.
