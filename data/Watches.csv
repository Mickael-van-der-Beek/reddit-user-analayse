This whole subreddit now has a very impersonal feel to it, with all the categorization in brackets. It's like we are trying to make everything readable for a machine. Posting is like filling out a form, for god's sake!

Also, the ban of link- or pic-posts, I find sad. Sometimes (well, often), I liked to just open all the pics with RES and look through them. This was a very quick and enjoyable way of finding posts that I was interested in.

All that said, I am OK with rules like putting the name of your watch in the title, but the way this is done now just gives the aforementioned feeling.

This was a few weeks ago my favorite subreddit and now I hardly ever stop scrolling for one of the posts. Do you people agree or am I completely alone with my opinion?

And yet, the price of quality watches is not all air; you're paying for Swiss engineering and craftsmanship.

Have quality watches such as the Omega Speedmaster always been a luxury item for the wealthy or could an average Joe buy one? I collected data from 1959-2011 and compared the median household annual income with the price of the Speedmaster. The percentage of the price of the Speedmaster of the annual income gives a good measure on how affordable the watch has been to an average person through the decades. Here's the data.

| Year | Median Household Income | Price of Omega Speedmaster | Percentage |
|-----------:|------------:|------------:|----------:|
|1959	|$6 600	|$195	|2.95%
|1968	|$6 668	|$185	|2.77%
|1973	|$9 227	|$225	|2.44%
|1985	|$22 080	|$1 295	|5.87%
|1991	|$28 819	|$1 500	|5.20%
|1996	|$34 652	|$2 295	|6.62%
|2011	|$49 103	|$4 400	|8.96%

**Chart**: http://imgur.com/8jfrI.png

**Conclusion**
When Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the moon back in 1969, alghough not cheap, the Speedmaster was within reach even for an average watch enthusiast. But in our day 9 % of annual income for a watch is simply too much for an average person.

1330836887.0,180,self.Watches,qgtdm,My Dad Gave Me My First Submariner Last Night,mikewinsone,206,26,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/qgtdm/my_dad_gave_me_my_first_submariner_last_night/,"Last night my dad gave me my first Rolex. He had been saving 2 Submariners for my brother and I. My brother recently passed away at the young age of 26. I am 28. 

My dad sat me down last night and explained to me that he'd been waiting to do this for a while but wanted to wait until my brother ""made it"". I've been working in software development for the last 7 years and have achieved my dreams, built a wonderful family. My brother struggled with drugs, as have I in my distant past, but didn't make it through the hard times. 

My brother was found dead in his condo 2 months ago tomorrow. 

It's been a rough couple of months loosing my brother. We're only 18 months apart and have always been close even when we went through times of not spending much time together. 

I have a couple of his watches, an Invicta (the submariner tribute one w/ nato band) and a michael kores (sp?)) that I keep on a shelf with some photos.

When my dad sat me down and presented me with this green leather box I immediatly broke down. I know what these watches mean to my dad. He wears a couple of submariners and an explorer. 

I speant a few minutes crying and hugging him because I knew this had to do with my brother's passing somehow. We stayed up until 2am talking about life, family and my brother. 

He explained to me that he gave me the watch because he wants me to understand the appreciation for excellence he has and that he thinks that I have gotten there and deserve it. It feels weird to wear a watch like this at my age but every time I look at it I think about him, my brother and my responsibility to my family to be the best that I can be.

My dad started something of a tradition this weekend. I hope to carry it on.

1365308816.0,174,self.Watches,1bu54b,[Omega] A Job Offer,Isochronasm,191,17,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1bu54b/omega_a_job_offer/,"I know this isn't the type of thing usually posted on this subreddit but I thought some of you might be interested. This would usually fall under the ""no spam"" rule so I got the consent of the moderators first. 

I have a job offer I would like to extend to the /r/watches[1]  community. I work at an Omega service center in Seattle WA. and our case prep technician is leaving us soon and we are in need of a replacement. The job doesn't require any experience working with watches, just some mechanical aptitude and attention to detail. There will be a lot of training to do and I would be overseeing most of it so I can answer any specific questions. This would be the perfect opportunity for someone who is interested in watches doesn't have any training to get in to the field.

The main focus of your job is to disassemble and reassemble the case components of a watch. The case components include but are not limited to the case middle, case back, crystal, bezel and bracelet. You will learn how to tear down a case, clean it, change the gaskets, replace helium valves, replace chronograph pushers, repair bracelets and completely reassemble everything so it is ready to go back to the customer. It is important that the case is completely clean and resealed before the movement is placed back inside to ensure that debris and moisture don't contaminate anything. Many Omega watches are designed to be taken diving and need to be tested in a pressurized water tank before the movement is put back in and once again after the watch is fully assembled. You will receive training on the operation of these water testers as well as the dry tester that uses compressed air and vacuum to test how airtight the watch is. There are many Omega specific tools you will be trained with as well as standard machinery found in almost all watch repair facilities. 

The shop itself is pretty unique in a lot of ways. It is the only Swatch Group US service center that is attached to an active boutique. There is a large bank of windows that separates the service center from the sales floor, this lets customers in the boutique look directly in to the lab as we work. It feels like I'm in a watchmaking fish bowl sometimes. I should also mention that we are in mid transition from an Omega boutique to a Tourbillon boutique. This transition wont affect the repair side of things much but it will mean that the boutique will have a lot more interesting watch brands to play with (Breguet, Blancpain, Glashutte and a few others). 

Almost no one has applied for this position so far and no one has sat for a bench test yet. I think this is because most people don't even know that the luxury watch repair industry even exists and this job is kind of a niche inside of that industry. That and the job description on careerbuilder is absolutely terrible. http://www.careerbuilder.com/JobSeeker/Jobs/JobDetails.aspx?APath=2.31.0.0.0&amp;job_did=JB74P8696XL4X8KQP3C&amp;IPath=ILKV0A[2] 

If you have any questions about the position, Omega, or about the watch fixing business in general feel free to ask me anything you can think of.

One of the most common questions asked here is ""Please help me find a watch"", with relatively minor variations. We thought it would good to create a more comprehensive resource for /r/Watches, and create the Official /r/Watches Buying Guide.

We will structure the buying guide similarly to the /r/Watches Brand Guide. Once every two weeks, we will post a thread asking for the /r/Watches community to offer suggestions for watch purchases.

In each thread, we will solicit watch suggestions by price, in the following categories:
$0-250, $250-$500, $500-$1000, $1000-$2000, $2000+

The price class is in US dollars, and refers to the street price (cost of acquisition) of the watch, not the suggested retail price.

In addition, we will have one watch suggestion thread for ladies' watches, with an open price class.

These threads will be linked in the [/r/Watches FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/watches) for future reference.

This week, we are asking you to to offer suggestions on $0-$250 watches.

**For readability, please structure your suggestions like this: (One suggestion per comment)**

*****


**[brand &amp; watch name]**

Price: [price in US dollars, used and new]

Movement: [quartz/automatic/mechanical/auto-quartz/solar-powered quartz/electric]

Style: [dress, sports, sports-elegance, diver, pilot, fashion, outdoors, pocketwatch]

Size: [size of the watch, mm for wrist-watches (specify with or without the crown), movement size for pocket watches]

Link: [URL to manufacturer/fan webpage, imgur album, youtube video or google image search]

Description: [Write a few words about why this is an excellent choice of a watch]

(If there is a movement/style that is not listed that makes a more appropriate description of the watch, feel free to use it. For example, an IWC Portuguese Chronograph might be referred to as a ""dress chronograph"")


**For example:**
*****

**Waltham 1892**

Price: ~$100-$150 used, unavailable new

Movement: Mechanical

Style: Pocket Watch

Size: 18 size pocket watch movement

Description:

I think the greatest value in finely crafted watches can be found in old American pocket watches. We often think of Swiss watches as the top of watchmaking today, but this wasn't always the case. Back in the day, American watches were the height of the art, with American railroad grade being the quality mark of an accurate timepiece. It seems incomprehensible now, but once upon a time, the Swiss made fakes of American watches to fool unsuspecting customers into believing they were buying a quality American-made timepiece. 

These classic American watches were hand-made, finely crafted, and beautifully finished in that distinctive American style. The craftsmanship exhibited in these watches would fetch thousands of dollars in a modern watch.

Since pocket watches have largely fallen out of style, the prices of these timepieces have fallen dramatically compared to their quality. The Waltham I have selected is only one of a myriad of possibilities for a budget-minded watch enthusiast wishing to possess a finely finished, hand-made watch.

I recommend either purchasing a watch that has been recently serviced, or budgeting $150+ for a watchmaker to service it.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/t83z8/looking_for_a_pocket_watch/) is a thread talking about suggestions on what are interesting pocket watch brands to look into, which links several resources.

Remember, **one suggestion per comment, please make multiple comments for multiple suggestions.** Thanks!

If you disagree with someone, please debate them, don't downvote them. The purpose of these discussion threads is to encourage discussion, so people can read different opinions to get different ideas and perspectives on how people view these brands. Downvoting without giving a counter-perspective is not helpful to anybody, and will earn you super looks of disapproval from everyone else. ಠ_ಠ

Please ONLY propose watch suggestions, and discuss those watches in this thread.

1367364096.0,139,self.Watches,1dg13x,[Trip Report] New York,Toys_and_Bacon,154,15,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1dg13x/trip_report_new_york/,"I'm procrastinating, as I have far more important - but also significantly more boring stuff to write. So here's a travel journal from a recent trip to New York. Apologies for occasionally lousy pictures, but at the time, I was mainly just snapping quick shots of how a watch looked on my wrist.    
  
I wasn't mainly there for the watches, but I had scheduled in a day to run around the various boutiques, and as it turned out I could have spend a lot longer doing this. Even if I didn't plan on buying a watch, me and my friend had a great time, and I encourage any watch enthusiast to do the same.   
The purpose for me was simply to see certain watches in person, and I had ambitions of trying on a few models I'm considering in the future. This was also the case for my friend. What we didn't expect was how eager the people working in the various stores were to place expensive watches on our wrists. Keep in mind, I don't feel I look like the typical customer for $15000 watches, nor did I give any indications that I was going to buy one. I guess they just recognized that we were enthusiasts.   
  
I had marked a few places on the map, but there were a lot more interesting places than I had realized. Most of the big brands, either within watches or jewelry, had boutiques in, or around fifth avenue and 57st street. And walking casually up Madison avenue from St. Patrick's cathedral, you'll pass many of the most well known luxury brands. 
http://i.imgur.com/Nri7DT5.jpg  

First up was probably the brand I'm liking best of the luxury watch makers, **Girard Perregaux** (3 on map). They had a tiny store in Madison Avenue, and like all the other stores, we were greeted by a guard that opened the door for us. A rather dimly lit store, we met a very polite gentleman that offered to show us anything we wanted. I had ambitions of trying the 1945, the 1966 and the new Seahawk. Sadly, the pictures I took here were by far the worst, but the watches were probably among those I liked the most. The new Seahawk is completely bad ass, with amazing details, and it sits extremely comfortable on the wrist, despite it being huge. The 1945 is just gorgeous, and it curved perfectly around my wrist. I wasn't too sold on the 1966.   
http://i.imgur.com/nDFQIkuh.jpg  
http://i.imgur.com/OgAxUKSh.jpg  
http://i.imgur.com/HFjnVlQh.jpg  

The guy in the store asked where we were from, and if we had any of the big brands represented in our country, and we had a nice chat. This was before noon, and no one else was in the store - so I assumed he had nothing better to do than to chat with us. We expected the stores to gradually fill up over the course of the day, but this wasn't the case. Remarkably quiet in every boutique, maybe except for IWC. But I'll get back to that.   
  
We went further up the street until we came across **F. P. Journe**. Now, this was a curious place. First of all, I was surprised FPJ were even big enough to warrant a boutique, let alone one in Madison Ave, but there it was. A really tall guy who obviously had struggled with his tie that morning greeted us. Well, he didn't look too interested in us at first, but warmed up when I took interest in the complications of one of the pieces. What interested me the most here was a super light sports watch in titanium (I believe), which honestly had the weight of a kids' Swatch. It wasn't a pretty watch, but damn, did it feel like wearing nothing.     
http://i.imgur.com/fZdYf1Oh.jpg    
http://i.imgur.com/Kjb0L7Hh.jpg  
  
I forgot to mark PFJ on the map, but it was right next to **Vacheron Constantin** (2 on map), which obviously was our next stop. Stunning display on the outside with various Overseas models. Sadly a bit disappointing to me, after being blown away by Girard Perregaux. A lady took us further into the store, also relatively dimly lit, to show us some models. I don't know. The Overseas just didn't click for me, but they do make some extremely nice looking dress watches, and their tourbillon - the actual visual design of their tourbillon is cool.

http://i.imgur.com/BdNLwcTh.jpg    
This was, by the way, the only place where we didn't feel completely welcome, which I guess can be a reason why I wasn't overly enthusiastic about the watches. I guess I can understand that. Here we are, two guys in sneakers wearing plastic and quartz watches...    But then again, that didn't seem to matter a single bit to the people over at....
  
  
**Breguet** (1 on map). Where we were greeted by a super happy lady, who seemed genuinely excited over the fact that we we knew of her brand. She showed us the type XX and XXI (?) and claimed that since I was already wearing a big watch, I should have no problem wearing the XXI. Notice my watch in the background. Breguet was the first store with decent lighting. They also had a reasonable space, in contrast to the first three stores, which seemed a bit cramped.     
http://i.imgur.com/YOqXcsph.jpg  
http://i.imgur.com/XZiSrAjh.jpg  

  
Just as enthusiastic, and even more genuine was a cool, Swiss-born lady over at **Hublot** (4 on map). Jackie, she presented herself as, was chatty, and showed us around the store, gave us a few tips on where to eat, and let us try what ever we wanted. She got really excited when we told her about the Knicks game we were going to, later that day. She was a big fan herself, and was obviously happy that they had signed Kobe Bryant to the brand. She didn't have the new Kobe watch in store, but was more than happy to show pictures of it. She also said she had always managed to not be at work when the famous people came by, but she hoped to see both Kobe and Dwyane Wade some day. The door man said he was waiting just as eagerly for John Wayne to come by, but expected to be disappointed.

http://i.imgur.com/sUAGUpFh.jpg  
  
  
Also, around this area of Madison Avenue: **Hermes** (4 on map), who also sells ties and handbags, had a store, but we didn't go inside. **DeGrisogono** (13 on map) also had a boutique, but I was for some reason a bit intimidated.  
http://i.imgur.com/wF6NKefh.jpg  
http://i.imgur.com/j8wTYzhh.jpg  
  
We went back to fifth avenue, and as expected the streets are far more crowded. But that wasn't the case once you got inside the stores. I have to say, I didn't walk into the **Rolex** boutique, nor did I visit **Omega**, or the adjacent **Breguet** boutique (8 on map) . In retrospect, maybe I should have, but if there were crowds inside a watch store, it would be those two. We went inside **Harry Winston** (7 on map), but their stock of watches was a bit underwhelming.   
Stores I also failed to visit were **Cartier** (who along with Rolex has their very own buildings, so I didn't mark them on map), **Bulgari** (12 on map), **Van Cleef and Arples** (known for their weird retrogrades, 11 on map).   
  
A place we did enter, on the other hand, was **Toruneau**. Tournaeu had two stores, the biggest one, called **Time Machine** (6 on map), is located in the same building as Niketown. I believe this is one of the Trump buildings. Four stories filled with watches, ranging from Casio digital watches to Patek Philippe torubillons. This place was fun, but far less personal, and inviting than the boutiques. The first floor had mid range like Rolex, Tag, Cartier. Stuff like that. On the ground floor, we found brands entry level luxury like Baume et Mercier, Frederique Constant, Hamilton. And also cheap watches like G-Shock and Swatch. The third floor was actually just an area between two stairs, and could be considered half a floor at best, but this place was dedicated to Patek Philippe. I wanted to check out a couple of models, but there were quite a queue of potential customers, so we went up to the top floor.   
What we found on the fourth floor was a limited selection of pretty much any luxury watch brand you could imagine. My friend quickly located Zenith, and started salivating when he got his hands on a pilot. We got help from ""sales professional"" named Igor, who was more than happy to let us indulge in great watches.     
http://i.imgur.com/Dd8iCFNh.jpg  
http://i.imgur.com/R8PWX8Uh.jpg  
http://i.imgur.com/7uLNZUZh.jpg  

I swear to god, it wasn't me: But just a few days later, we heard on the news that a man had stolen a watch from Tourneay. Apparently it was a Cartier, and he just ran out of the store after trying it on. 
  
Further down Madison Avenue we found **Tourneau's** other store (10 on map), this one was slightly different. One store, watches lined up from wall to wall. It was not the coolest thing I saw in NYC, but pretty close. At this point, me and my friend was almost numbed by seeing all these great watches, and the sight of a complicated JLC seemed almost insignificant. Almost.

http://i.imgur.com/7AbTF9Zh.jpg  
http://i.imgur.com/oYmSuIKh.jpg    
  
Not far away we found **IWC** and **Panerai's** boutiques (9 on map). Neither of us has any interest in Panerai, but my friend likes some of IWC's models. This was the only boutique we visited that was crowded. Well, in the sense that we had to wait for a seller to help us. Luckily, this was just a marvelous place. IWC has worked a lot with building their image, and this store was by far the most elaborate of the places we visited. They had unique sections of their store dedicated to their individual lines. For instance, the pilot models were placed in and around something that looked like a pilot's lockerroom. The Portuguese was given room in a huge bookshelf containing various travel effects. Aquatimer was located inside a shower room. My friend tried on the gorgeous Vintage Ingenieur, and almost pulled the trigger. This one is becoming rarer by the minute. He would have gotten a good deal on it as well. He regretted it almost immediately.

Finally, the last stop of the excursion was **Audemars Piguet's** flagship store (5 on map). This one I had been anticipating, and I wasn't disappointed. But it was remarkable, this was prime time, around 3-4pm, and once again we found ourselves alone in the store. We met with Manuela, who was more than happy to let us fondle with various Royal Oak models. What a watch. The blue faced one was my absolute favorite of the day, but the gold on leather wasn't bad either. Even my friend, who has been vocal in his distaste for the RO, warmed to the design when he first got to hold - and try on these watches. Manuela tempted me with 5 year warranty and help with getting seats in MSG, but with added New York sales tax and import tax, it's significantly cheaper for me to buy a Royal Oak where I live. Still tempting.

Well, this got a bit longer than I had expected. Again, if you're in New York, make the effort to visit these stores.   
  
Bonus picture: Safely home, I finally managed to snap a decent shot with my phone camera, while visiting a local Breugue AD.

There are others floating around but I seem to be the only one with special notation (and long winded usually boring technical explanations for some minor detail or piece of advice). In any case, for the last year I had been employed by an independent jewelry store as their watchmaker and some jewelry work and general sales on the side. That is no longer the case. I can now announce after a few months of back and forth and bench testing and more paperwork that I am now officially employed by [Richemont](http://richemont.com/our-businesses.html) as a technician for Baume et Mercier and Montblanc. What this means for me is a much (much) bigger city, along with many other things obviously. What it means for the rest of you all here is not a whole lot, but that you'll likely see me able to give more insight into the watches from BM and Montblanc (and perhaps some of the other Richemont brands) in the coming months as I catch up with their offerings and become more familiar with them and have my hands all over them all day. 

I'm certainly going to maintain my presence here, and while I'm sure I won't have the same number of opportunities at the new job to steal some time away to check in here I will keep checking in a few times a day. I don't post quite as much as I used to (due in part to the now larger number of knowledgeable people who frequent here and beat me to answering questions) but I do still look at almost every submission. 

I'm still almost always happy to answer questions directed to me, but please do realize there are certain things, mostly pertaining to Richemont policies and practices that I'm not legally allowed to talk about, so if I do decline to answer it may be because my hands are tied (or my mouth is gagged as the case may be). My apparent fetish for excessive parentheses use may also be off the table. 

I just wanted to fill everyone in on some recent happenings in my life. I do have a few other random posts planned for the near future to share some other mildly interesting horological curiosities as well, look for those after a few weeks once I get settled in to my new apartment and things get a bit less hectic for me.

I hope you all find interest in it as well:



*Preámbulo a las instrucciones para dar cuerda al reloj*



Piensa en esto: cuando te regalan un reloj te regalan un pequeño infierno florido, una cadena de rosas, un calabozo de aire. No te dan solamente el reloj, que los cumplas muy felices y esperamos que te dure porque es de buena marca, suizo con áncora de rubíes; no te regalan solamente ese menudo picapedrero que te atarás a la muñeca y pasearás contigo. Te regalan —no lo saben, lo terrible es que no lo saben—, te regalan un nuevo pedazo frágil y precario de ti mismo, algo que es tuyo pero no es tu cuerpo, que hay que atar a tu cuerpo con su correa como un bracito desesperado colgándose de tu muñeca. Te regalan la necesidad de darle cuerda todos los días, la obligación de darle cuerda para que siga siendo un reloj; te regalan la obsesión de atender a la hora exacta en las vitrinas de las joyerías, en el anuncio por la radio, en el servicio telefónico. Te regalan el miedo de perderlo, de que te lo roben, de que se te caiga al suelo y se rompa. Te regalan su marca, y la seguridad de que es una marca mejor que las otras, te regalan la tendencia de comparar tu reloj con los demás relojes. No te regalan un reloj, tú eres el regalado, a ti te ofrecen para el cumpleaños del reloj.



**TS;DR (too spanish, didn't read)** - I translated it to English to the best of my ability while trying to maintain the true meaning of the words:



*Preamble to instructions for winding a watch:*


Ponder this: when they gift you a watch they gift you a tiny, flowery inferno, a catena of roses, a prison of air. They do not gift you just the watch, that they give very happily and we hope that is lasts you because it is of good brand, Swiss with a pallet of rubies; they do not gift you just this tiny stonemason that will tie to your wrist and go with you. They gift you-- they do not know it, how terrible it is that they do not know--, they gift you a new fragile and precious piece of yourself, something that is yours but is not your body, that has to be attached to your body with a strap like desperate worker hanging from your wrist. They gift you the necessity to wind it every day, the obligation to wind it in order for it to continue being a watch; they gift you the obsession of attending to the exact hour in the windows of jewelery stores, in the radio announcements, in telephone services. They gift you the fear of losing it, that they will rob you of it, that you will fall and break it. They gift you its brand, and the security that it is a brand better than the others, they gift you the tendency to compare your watch with all other watches. They do not gift you a watch; you are the gift, they offer you for the birthday of the watch.

It was the most beautiful watch I'd seen and now I actually have one!  I was looking for a deal on the Junkers 6060-5, recently reviewed here, but a great deal on this Chronoscope (preowned) popped up first, so here it is.

[Junghans Max Bill Chronoscope with custom leather strap](http://imgur.com/a/ez8oI)


Junghans is a German watch company mostly notable for their minimalist/bauhaus designs (especially the Max Bill line, named after one of their watch designers from the 60s), but they use quality movements and make great watches overall.


Mfr. specs for this one in particular:

*Ref. Nr: 027/4601.00*

* *Automatic mechanical movement J880.2 with display for date*
* *chronoscope with second stop*
* *luminous hands and appliques*
* *stainless steel case Ø 40.0 mm*
* *convex hard Plexiglass with SICRALAN coating*
* *calfskin strap with stainless steel buckle, waterproof*

The ""J880.2"" movement they refer to is, to the best of my knowledge, a slightly modified Valjoux 7750 movement.  I am surprised at how loud the rotor/autowind can be at times, but I don't consider it a problem.

I put the original calfskin strap away in a box and had a custom strap made for it by Jeanna at Stone Creek straps.  She did a great job with it.  I generally like the brown leather/black watch combination, but I'm worried that I picked a leather slightly too dark here.  We'll see if I get used to it.

One thing that really scares me about this watch is the lack of water resistance.  I'm generally careful, but I got some moisture in one of my other watches just from washing up my daughter's hands after breakfast and I would be heartbroken if that happened to this one.",,False,,t5_2qls5,False,,,True,t3_1alope,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1alope/grail_acquired_junghans_max_bill_chronoscope_with/,

My parents had known I'd taken an interest in watches (vintage in particular) for some time and they do tend to be very astute gifters but I didn't even imagine that something like this would be given to me. I'd been trawling ebay on and off for bargains and picked up a nice 60s Junghans and a 70s Favre-Leuba but to get something as beautiful as this was an intensely emotional moment!

It was bought from a vintage dealer who supplies many of these vintage watches to Chinese buyers, who had sent this watch and another to my dad to look at for a couple of weeks on spec, no questions asked!

A fact/background sheet was included with the watch so I'll tell you the salient points of what that says.

-18k gold, entirely original, near mint
-can be described as a luxury civilian model of the watch (MkVII) supplied to RAF in WWII 
-ban on imported gold during war years means this watch was retailed in Europe
-cal. 478 movement

I wanted something still quite simple. My first look was at some Radeo because they were all black, but I didn't like the shape of them. 

Most people having one from this serie got the Calibre17RS, but I didn't want to have a chronograph nor to have more than one button and something with too much complications in it.

(x-post from /r/Seiko)",Seikoholic,121,14,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1cet68/seiko_61396005_resist_aka_pogue_80_days_in_orbit/,"You may or may not have seen the term ""Pogue"" tossed around when discussing 6139-600x chronographs (made from '69-79).  You might not know why, or have an incomplete understanding. 

[There was this guy - Col. William Pogue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_R._Pogue) - he was a U.S.A.F. veteran of the Korean War, and in '66 he was selected for NASA.  He didn't do the Apollo stuff, but instead got to go to Skylab 4 - from September '73 to February '74.  

In the training prior to launch, he hadn't been issued with his standard Omega Speedmaster yet, so he wandered down to the PX at Edwards AFB and put a deposit down on a Seiko chronograph.  He paid it off, and then used it every day.  He specifically states he used it to time engine burns.  When the time came for launch he was supposed to leave his Seiko behind... but he snuck it aboard hidden in the leg of his spacesuit. 

He continued to wear both his Seiko and his Omega at the same time - one set to his home time zone, one set to Houston.  Here he is in orbit, and you can see that [he is wearing two watches](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Skylab_4_trash.jpg) - the one on his left is the Seiko.

Some people aren't clear on what a ""Pogue"" is or should be.  Pogue's watch was a 1971 Seiko 6139-6005, serial number 190985.  It had ""Water 70m Resist"" on the dial, along with ""17j"" above the Suwa symbol just above the minute-counter dial.   Under ""SEIKO"" it just says ""automatic"".  Seiko had several variants of these watches based on geographic distribution, and non U.S. ones had slightly different dial text as a result.    

[Here's an actual photograph of the watch](http://i.imgur.com/SuHpkMd.jpg) after thirty-five years of continual use.  One thing that makes for some confusion is that the watch has a white indicator ring.  Some people used to think that Seiko produced a white ring as a result.  They never did.  These watches came with a yellow ring to match the dial, and they faded like a bastard.  The blue/black dial versions came with a black ring, and it too fades, but to a greyish-white.  In every case where I've seen a white ring, when I've taken it out and flipped it over, it's still yellow underneath.  Ditto for the black - grey on top, black underneath.  

[This is my ""Pogue""](http://i.imgur.com/6IMW7R1.jpg) - it's a 6139-6005 ""Resist"", only a few thousand units away from Pogue's, and it's entirely original and is what his looked like new.

Anyway, so when you're digging around, hoping to buy a ""Pogue"", know what you are looking for.  There are lots of watches out there that unscrupulous or unclear sellers will attach the label ""Pogue"" to.  Know your Pogues - accept no substitutes!",,False,,t5_2qls5,1366061317.0,,,True,t3_1cet68,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1cet68/seiko_61396005_resist_aka_pogue_80_days_in_orbit/,

1337095506.0,107,self.Watches,tob2f,How I became a master watchmaker's apprentice... ,hrgilbert,115,8,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/tob2f/how_i_became_a_master_watchmakers_apprentice/,"Hey /r/watches, 

I just started a new job/training/apprenticeship under a certified Master Watchmaker. I thought I'd tell you the story of how that happened, and a little bit about it, for anyone who is interested in doing the same, or simply just likes a good story about watches, clocks and their making. 

First of all, I should say that I have absolutely no formal training in watchmaking or anything relevant to watchmaking — I just graduated my third year of university and I study philosophy. Watches, and more specifically, watchmaking, is merely something that is extremely interesting to me, and something that I may want to pursue in the future. 

Anyways, onto how I got such an awesome job! 

Basically, my parents' old ""business-coach"", is from Switzerland and often imports a few brands from Switzerland to North America (nothing fancy, price ranges are anywhere from $400 - $1,000). He was at the past Basel World Fair, which of course, peaked my interests (this was at a time when I was still in school — about ~1,500 Km away) but couldn't really meet with him or anything like that. Long story short, I mentioned to my parents my keen interest in watches and watchmaking and he told them that I should contact a friend of his, which, as soon as I arrived home, I did! 

Well, that phone conversation turned out much better than I could ever have expected. He agreed to hire/train/apprentice me for the summer (~4 months) and to send me off to school with lots of books, some hand tools, for me to practice until I've graduated and can do something with him full time. 

Yesterday was my first *real* day (I went into his workshop for an interview prior to that), which pretty much consisted of a tour of his workshop (an amazing place! He has everything required to make a complete wrist watch or clock from scratch, and more. Lathes, wheel cutters, CNC machines, etc. Then he took me to my very own watchmaker's bench, from Bulova (he worked there for a while and has accumulated lots of equipment from them and others), complete with some very basic and elementary tools. He has said that, the farther along and more skilled I get, the better tools I will get to use (he even has a spare watchmaker's lathe for me to get my hands on!) as a sort of graduation system. 

He has also gotten me some reading material: a book on practical clockmaking (where we start, as it their movement are much larger) and a book on practical watchmaking. He would've had me read George Daniels' Watchmaking but I already owned it prior to working for him! (Sidenote, he said that when he was my age, 21, that he attempted to build a Daniels Tourbillon, but didn't get into to much detail).

The only real ""work"" that I had to do that day was somewhat of a test. ""Throwing me to the wolves"" as he called it (remember I have no formal training whatsoever). He quickly took apart a clock movement in front of me, then showed me how to ultrasonically clean the gears and plates. He did the gears and then got me to hand clean them afterwards, then put them through the cleaner again. The same was done with the plates (only I did those independently, which he would inspect). After I finished cleaning them, ultrasonically and by hand, as well as dried them, he inspected the plates and said that they were good (which made me happy!). Now, keep in mind that I have no formal training, he has never taught anybody without formal training before and so this is all kind of new to him as well. 

As a final ""test"" for the day, we laid out the gears and mixed them all up. He put the base plate on the table in front of me, and we attached it to some movement holders. He then said, ""I'll be back in a few minutes, try putting it back together. I know this is Greek to you, but I'd like to see where your hand-eye skills are at — so just give me a shout when you're done, or too frustrated to continue!"" 

I had never touched a clock movement before (or a watch movement) but have dreamed about it for a long time, so this was a really exciting moment for me. After about 10 minutes of playing around, I managed to successfully assemble the three gear trains (time, chime and strike) and put the cover plate on. He came by to inspect, and it worked! I felt great, and even better when he said ""you've impressed the shit out of me!"" A fantastic start...

Then he asked me to disassemble and reassemble again, which I did successfully as well. 

That pretty much sums up my first day, if people are interested I can post more info as I continue. It's all very exciting and I honestly just feel so lucky to be working with a master, in a field that I am so passionate about! Let me know if you have any sort of questions and I will do my best to answer them! 

P.S. Here is the assembled [clock movement](http://imgur.com/2bgUZ).

*Story time*
Was looking for a new watch and had a hard time making a decision on it. Top choices were Nomos Tangente Sport Datum, Used Omega Speedmaster 3570.50 (Hesalite), Grand Seiko SBG011 Snowflake, JLC Ultrathin 38mm manual, and JLC Reverso Ultrathin.

In the end, I just couldn't get myself to drop over $3,000 on a watch despite having saved enough, so it came down to the used Speedy at 2k or a new Tangente Sport Datum at 2.7k. Called watchbuys and the guy there basically convinced me to not buy it. He said that it wasn't what they were known for, it didn't fit with the bauhaus design that they have going as a company, and that the resell value wouldn't be as great.

Thought about it for a while after that... the Speedy looks great... but a couple of things pushed me back to Nomos. First, Nomos is an awesome new company that I want to support. Independent movement manufacture with well decorated movements, subdued/classy designs, and very little money spent on marketing? Yes, please. Second, the Speedy Pro is a collector's classic (for good reason), and the hipster in me wants something a little out of the norm.

So, I called back and this guy at watchbuys couldn't believe that the other guy had convinced me to back off the Tangente Sport Datum. Anyway, I opted for the Tangente Datum and I think it was a good choice. It's a bit thinner in height, the bezel is thinner, and it is pretty much their flagship model.

*Thoughts on the Nomos Tangente Datum*
Oh my, this is going to be a long post... but let me finish up with thoughts. Winding the watch is fun! So glad I went with manual. The hands are not nearly as blue as they appear in studio pictures. Most of the time, they look black because shadow or dim lighting (although I am partially color-blind so that probably doesn't help). The watch is a lot lighter than I thought it would be. It's running at about +3 seconds / day. The long-distance date is definitely bigger than your typical date window and looks awesome.

I don't ever get comments on the watch in person because at first glance it's so plain. That's fine with me; I wear the watch for me, not for them.",,False,,t5_2qls5,1366635056.0,,,True,t3_1cuz0c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1cuz0c/nomos_pictures_and_thoughts_on_my_new_nomos/,

My parents agreed to have it restored as a gift for my upcoming graduation. He was a chemist and I majored in chemistry during undergrad so it was a really nice keepsake.

Sadly I have no before pictures but it was in horrible shape. They had to totally restore the entire face and bezel and they also replaced the crown. Had all the work done in Central Watch in Grand Central Terminal in NYC and they really did a phenomenal job.

I don't have too much information about the watch though. I know its a mid-1950's, manual wind Omega. Omega's vintage website doesn't have too much information about it and I brought it into an Omega boutique once and all they could tell me was the possible years. If anyone can shed any more light that would be great as I really would like to know more.

I flipped two Seiko 5s before finding a watch worth keeping in my Maratac Pilot. After that one thing led to another and I'm currently at 6 automatics. My tastes have changed several times since the beginning with watches going on and off what you would call the ""short"" and ""long"" lists. However I feel that I can say with a fair amount of certainty that the watches I own currently are long term keepers.


Well then let's get on to the watches...this thread isn't meant to be any sort of diligent or thorough review of these pieces but I'll say something about them all and give their essential specifications. Please feel free to ask questions about anything I didn’t go into detail about and I will answer to the best of my ability.

In order in which they were acquired:


Model: “Pilot” 2013

Brand: Maratac

Lug width: 22mm

Lug-to-Lug: 55mm

Case diameter: 46mm

Strap: Maratac NATOs

Movement: Miyota 8245

Cost: $280 ($240 when I bought)

[Bond NATO](http://i.imgur.com/K0bwq60.jpg)


*I like the tool look of this piece. This is something I love to wear when we take the dogs to the woods or go camping. It is really easy to read and the C3 is amazingly bright. It is very large, many here have said too large for my wrist. Perhaps it is too large but I like having that one huge piece. It is the only watch I wear on a NATO and I think with the field dial it looks just right on NATO straps. As the price on this one continues to rise it is becoming less and less of a deal.*
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Model: “Somes”

Brand: Orient Star

Lug width: 21mm

Lug-to-Lug: 45mm

Case diameter: 43mm

Strap: OEM strap - bridle leather made by Somes

*I knew I had caught the fever when I bought this one. My decision was largely influenced by a very [well written article](http://forums.watchuseek.com/f71/depth-review-orient-star-wz0211el-white-dial-somes-lots-pics-848494.html) on WUS. The styling seemed very unique to me and I had been becoming intrigued with cushion cases in general. It seemed dressy and manly at the same time. The strap on this piece seals the deal too. The bridle leather is simply unmatched when compared to any other leather I’ve touched. It is thick but flexible and has the most intoxicating aroma. My gf simply doesn’t “get” this one but I love wearing it around. I have a feeling this won’t be my only dip into the JDM pond.*

Model: C60 Trident

Brand: Christopher Ward

Lug width: 22mm

Lug-to-Lug: 50mm

Case diameter: 42mm

*The watch I yearned for like no other. I had tossed off the ideas of making any small purchases so much as a strap in order to fund this as quickly as possible. But before I even had the funds gathered my gf stunned me on our two year anniversary by presenting it to me as a gift. Talk about a keeper. I love this watch, I really don’t even know how else to say it. I know it has elements of this watch and that watch from those big names...I don’t care because I love THIS watch. There is a reason ChrWard sells a ton of C60s and it is because they are well worth twice the price they charge. I have became quite hooked on the idea of textured dials too due to this one. My gf gifted it to me on leather but I however quite like it on a bracelet. I was lucky enough to get one of the last few old style bracelets by contacting them by email. The option to pick up the new one will be there indefinitely so it's not out of the question in the future.*

Lug width: 20mm

Lug-to-Lug: 47mm

*This piece pretty much fell out of the sky and into my lap. It caught my eye early on in my WUS days in WRUW threads. However I quickly pieced together that it had been made in a limited quantity of 150 two years earlier and popped up for sale so infrequently that it was dubbed a “unicorn”. Then one day some forum member casually mentioned in a thread that he was considering moving his along so I messaged him. As it turns out by chance I saw his post within a minute of it going up and was the first to inquire. He was nice enough to give me priority on it. I like having a moonphase complication. Some liken it to wearing like a pick because of it's small diameter while being quite thick due to the added complications. I like how it wears though and it solicits A LOT of compliments. My gf actually says she likes this better than the C60 she purchased for me or any other watch I own for that matter.*

Model: Layan

Brand: Maranez

Lug width: 24mm

Lug-to-Lug: 53mm

Case diameter: 43mm

Strap: 24/22 “Marina” strap from C&amp;B 

Movement: Miyota 8215

*This watch started out as an espresso maker...let me explain. My gf who listens quite well got me an espresso maker for Valentine’s day as I had going on about wanting one. Within a month it failed despite positives reviews...so back it went and replaced with a different brand with still positive reviews. That one broke within a day. At that point we were both fed up with espresso makers and she mentioned “that brass watch you were looking at”. I lamented to her that it was sold out and I had missed my chance. However I took a shot in the dark by emailing the company and sure enough they were still sitting on 3 Layans. It is essentially the same case as the bronze Magrette and from my understanding most likely made in the same mold. I like the uniqueness of this piece, it may not match everything but when it does it looks really nice. I wasn’t digging to 24/24 pre-V style strap it come on and have been much happier since switching to 24/22 with a thumbnail. The C3 is well applied and glows just as bright as my Maratac.*

Model: C11 Makaira Pro

Brand: Christopher Ward

Lug width: 22mm

Lug-to-Lug: 51mm

Case diameter: 42mm

Cost: $685

[Isofrane](http://i.imgur.com/ixi8bY1.jpg)

*My most recent acquisition and something I had looked at on and off. With the recent 15% off sale at ChrWard I decided to take the plunge. One of my issues with enjoying divers is that a lot of them look quite similar and I try to stick to variety in my collection when possible (sensible). The C11 Makaira is different from my C60 is many ways: square case, countdown bezel, internal bezel, and a completely different dial aesthetic. It’s much less “dressy” than the C60 and I like how sporty it looks. This piece really let me put ChrWard’s claims about unmatched customer service to test though. I received mine and was very excited until I realized some specs had made it under the crystal during assembly. I took some photos and sent them off to customer service. They were very apologetic and asked me to ship it back at their expense. On top of that they shipped my replacement with expedited shipping the moment I sent her the tracking number for my return watch. Haven’t encountered many companies that will replace an item before they have even received the faulty one. My replacement is due to be here Monday and I have an Isofrane with RS buckle ready to put on it.*

What does the future hold? I'm not really sure right now. I've already paid for the WUS Chinese forum watch this year which is a ST5 movement project and will be buying the Affordables forum watch which is being produced my Bernhardt's Fred Amos. If I saw a Citizen Orca pop up for sale I don't know if I could pass and I've been considering picking up a Rodina on mesh.

Here are the watches I've ""flipped"" due to not bonding with them:

A few months ago my GF and I decided to get engaged (no, I didn't 'pop' the question) and since I was going to get her a diamond engagement ring she decided that she wanted to buy me my watch! I didn't argue... :)

I visited the Tag Heuer and Omega boutiques in the mall and tried a few watches on, took a few pictures which I posted here on /r/watches.  /u/sudo_root [suggested the Tri Color El Primero which he said was also available in the more subtle grey](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/13r8eh/buying_my_first_proper_watch_what_do_you_guys/c76ggfz). I didn't like the tri colour at all, it just wasn't my style. The grey looked a lot better but I still had the ""It's nice but... it's not exactly a Tag"" attitude. Haha, little did I know! Just by chance I clicked on the black dial model (which was released in 2012) and liked it straight away. It was immediately placed on my short list. 

The decision was cemented when my GF came to stay with me (LDR) and we both visited the Zenith boutique to try it on.


Anyway, onto the watch...

Zenith was Founded in 1865 in Le Locle, Switzerland and are mostly known for their famous, ""El Primero"" movement, which although first released in 1969, is still made, in house, to this day! 

The El Primero (Spanish for 'the first') movement was, Zenith claim, was the world's first Automatic Chronograph and was said to be more accurate than many other watches as it featured a frequency of 36,000 VpH as opposed to the standard 18,000 or 28,800 VpH most other watches offered.

If you want to get a better feel of the difference in speed go to http://advanced.bestmetronome.com, click ""clear"", click ""metronome tick"" and then set the BPM to 300 for 18,000 VpH, 480 for 28,800 VpH and 600 for 36,000 VpH.

----

The El Primero Story

In the 1970's, Zenith; now owned by the LVMH group, was owned by Zenith Radio Corporation from the US. As quartz watches were all the rage at the time; Zenith Radio Corporation thought they saw the future in quartz watches and sent orders to Le Locle to sell all of the tools as scrap and to get rid of all the plans and blueprints for the automatic movements.

However, senior Zenith watchmaker Charles Vermont couldn't bring himself to kill off the automatics. Instead of selling everything for scrap as ordered, he carefully took apart the tools, wrapped and labelled them, before hiding them away in the Zenith factory attic. He also copied the procedures to recreate the movement from scratch in his notebook. 

Several years later another Swiss company asked Zenith if they had any El Primero movements for sale. Zenith did and the resulting watch, the Ebel 1911 Chronograph, proved such a huge success that Zenith recovered all their tooling and plans from the attic and the El Primero was reborn! Many other Swiss manufacturers also started using the El Primero movement including Rolex in the their famous [Daytona 16520](http://10pastten.com/itemimages/TA152%20-1521.JPG).

You can see some fascinating pictures of the old factory and the attic where everything was kept here:

Some people don't like the overlapping sub dials but it doesn't bother me in the slightest.

The only thing I would have liked is to swap the small seconds and chronograph hands around. 

For a watch famous for it's 36,000 VpH movement, it's a shame to 'relegate' the seconds to a sub dial. I would have loved it to show off the beautifully smooth sweeping seconds on the main dial... however, I know it wouldn't be a good idea to have the chronograph on a sub dial. 


Also, some of the more keen eyed amongst you might have noticed that the 6 o'clock sub dial on my watch says ""Automatic"" instead of ""Chronometer"" like some of the older El Primeros. This is because although the movement is exactly the same; Zenith no longer have their chronographs 'officially' COSC certified.

I hope you all enjoyed my write up and pictures. Feel free to ask any questions.

It was a watch that belonged to my grandfather but had sat in a drawer close to 20 years. He gave it to me and I immediately sent it to get serviced. Luckily for me, I inherited this beautiful timepiece while my grandfather was still alive. Today I will be driving to visit him and I am bringing the watch to show it to him. He was a watch repairman when he was younger and owned an Omega retail store in Mexico. I am sure he will be thrilled about the restoration.

I would just like to give kudos to the folks at Omega in NJ. You often hear about bad experiences but I wanted to share a positive one.

Between March 24th and June 24th I collected all upvotes, downvotes, and times submitted for each watch.  Since some posts did not include the models I would try to find them or mark them as Unidentified.  I have included the plots for the watches.  Only first replies were taken for the points.  Any posts with multiple watches were excluded.  I also excluded Ladies watches since they are not submitted very often.  Generally the points were recorded after the post had been up for at least 2 days but usually a week.   

The formula for points is the upvotes minus the downvotes divided by the times posted.

1363638926.0,95,self.Watches,1ajo08,Junkers Bauhaus 6060-5 Review,Georgious,109,14,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1ajo08/junkers_bauhaus_60605_review/,"So I finally acquired my grail watch a few weeks ago.  After posting in a few of the daily wrist-check threads, I've gotten some requests to post a full review with pictures.  So here goes.

First, the standard marketing spiel:

•Movement: Citizen Miyota Cal. 9100, mechanic, selfwinding, 26 jewels

•24 Hour display, power reserve indicator

•Hesalite crystal, crystal exhibition back

•Green lume

•Diameter: 40 mm case

•Water-resistant up to 5 atm

[Internet stock image](http://i.imgur.com/aAgo3WZ.jpg)

Marc, the owner of www.longislandwatch.com was kind enough to answer my million and one questions about the watch.  Best and most personable customer service I've ever had with a watch retailer - I would highly suggest checking them out.  He even upgraded me to express shipping  after we spoke a bit. Very easy guy to deal with - was a pleasure.

Anyway, onto the watch:


**Size**

At 40mm, it's a bit small for my taste, (I have really thin wrists, but I generally prefer 44-46mm watches) but being as the dial is 99% of the actual face, [it looks bigger than it is](http://i.imgur.com/CKuodsV.jpg).  


**The Crystal**

The raise and domed hesalite crystal is a really, really nice inclusion, adding a welcome amount of [depth to the watch face](http://i.imgur.com/6D3Kghd.jpg).

**The Band**

The watch comes with a very soft dark brown leather band.  It just so happened that the strap holes were spread just to the point where the band is either slightly too loose or slightly too tight.

[Band1](http://i.imgur.com/uI11bTn.jpg)
[Band2](http://i.imgur.com/YN9hmzQ.jpg)
[Band3](http://i.imgur.com/RAIZagT.jpg)

I ended up replacing the band with a [C&amp;B Camden Calfskin band](http://www.crownandbuckle.com/camden-20mm-black-calf.html), which I've had good experience with in the past.  I have to stress: this is absolutely not necessary; my wrist size is just a little awkward, but the stock strap is great.

**Exhibition Back**

Huge fan of the inscribed caseback

[Back2](http://i.imgur.com/XeUwCa8.jpg)

One issue I have with the watch is the noise the rotor creates.  It's LOUD.  Like Parnis loud.  I was pretty surprised that the Miyota 9100 movement - while gorgeous and very accurate (maybe +6 seconds a day, tops) - is damn loud.  
On the upside, it's the smoothest sweep I've ever seen in any auto I own, it's mesmerizing to watch!

That's that!  First watch I spent over $500 on, and I'm really happy with it.  I've been eyeing it for almost a year, and I've had a great experience thus far.  Junkers has two more Bauhaus watches in their 3-tier lineup.  There is a similarly priced Bauhaus with no power reserve or 24hr complications, sporting ETA movement.  And the equally beautiful chrono is quite a bit cheaper, with Japanese quartz movement.  

[Lined up here - with the chrono also available in white](http://i.imgur.com/CWZtoaC.jpg)

Most people associate James Bond with Rolex, or with Omega.  But during the late 70s through most of the 80s, Bond's wrist only had Seiko on it.  One of the crazier and cooler models was the [Seiko 7549-7009](http://forums.watchuseek.com/attachments/f74/431572d1304551675-did-you-miss-james-bond-watch-exhibition-frogman-got-you-seikobond2.jpg) barely visible in this underwater shot.

[Here's an album of the real thing](http://imgur.com/a/B4Wv1).  This example is special because it's entirely original, including the crystal, lume, hands etc.  This watch has very little wear, and can be viewed as a type specimen of the model.  This is what good looks like when it comes to these.

This watch is not only rare, but is exceptionally well-constructed.  The case, shroud screws and crown are titanium ion-plated with Titanium Nitride - hard-wearing &amp; durable.  The shroud is ceramic-coated steel.  Crystal is Hardlex.  The watch is rated for 600m depth, which is insane - the deepest recorded scuba dive was to 206 meters - one-third what this watch would do.  Any diver that went that deep wouldn't ever come up again.
The high-torque quartz movement is based on the robust 6309 - many of the parts are interchangeable.  

In its day this was a high-end piece, a serious professional dive watch, considered to be state of the art.  Accurate, robust, durable.  Not many were made, and they were made only for a few years in the late 70s and early 80s.  The quartz bubble popped in the late 80s and early 90s, with ""quartz"" becoming equated with ""cheap"", which can be true.  Once the technology was figured out, it was simple to crank out millions of cheap quartz watches.  But this huge production clouded the early days of the high-end quartz movements - serious timepieces, made to exacting standards.  As a result this era of quartz watches have been ignored and devalued in favor of the older [6159](http://www.makedostudio.com/watches/seiko-divers/albums/album42/chris_moy_6159_2.sized.jpg) hi-beat divers, or the concurrent production of the 6105 and 6309 divers.   But they're coming into their own, with an example like mine having a value in excess now of $1000, and they're only going up. 

These watches aren't for everyone - the black &amp; gold combination is unique, and they're not small, though at 48mm they're not that big anymore, and at only 116 grams they're lighter than they look.

Anyways, I came across this [one](http://forums.timezone.com/index.php?t=tree&amp;goto=6352332&amp;rid=12189#msg_6352332) by Vacheron Constantin today and it quite literally made my jaw drop. I love the sandblasted platinum dial against the pristinely polished case. Not to mention the great movement seen through the display back! 

Further, when compared with the watch-version, you can see just how small (I believe, 43 mm?) and slim this pocket watch is. I never liked how bulky and thick pocket watches tended to be, so this was a huge plus for me. There is also something to be said about the virtue of having a time only watch! Its just pure simplicity in the most beautiful way.

First r/watches post so I'll try to follow the rules as best I can. Specs compiled from google.

Big Date-
Breguet Caliber 517gg, contains 35 Jewels,
Engine-turned dial in silvered, 18-carat gold,
Chapter ring with BREGUET roman numerals and luminous minute-markers,
Large date at 6 o'clock,
Luminous BREGUET facetted open-tipped hands in 18-carat gold,
Engine-turned caseback with sapphire crystal,
Screw-locked crown,
Water-resistant to 100m,
Power reserve: 65 hours,
Diameter: 39mm

XXI-
Breguet 582(?) automatic chronograph movement, with a ""flyback"" function,
Luminous hands and numbers,
Case thickness (mm)- 17.30,
Case dimension (mm)- 44.00,
Jewels- 28,
Water (m)- 100,
Powers (hours)- 45

Both were gifts from relatives several years apart. I love them both. I'm more of a casual person so its actually a little awkward to wear them frequently but I try. I'm considering changing the strap on the XXI to the black one featured on the titanium edition. Brown/rose gold is a little too much. Anyway, just wanted to share.

1374351062.0,78,self.Watches,1ipn0h,[Review] IWC Ingeniuer 40 mm,ThrowAwayFetuses,90,12,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1ipn0h/review_iwc_ingeniuer_40_mm/,"I got this watch a few weeks ago. I have seen a couple other people on here who have one like it, but I wanted to share my thoughts on it.

**Presentation**

The box for this watch is very modern and sleek looking. The matte black coating shows fingerprints very easily though. Also, all of the metal inside the box is plastic, which is good, because when the watch shipped to me, it had kind of fallen sideways inside the box and the case was scraping against the little metal border around the indentation where the watch sits. The watch was steel, so it's fine though.

[box 2](http://i.imgur.com/5iyH5uW.jpg)

[box open](http://i.imgur.com/n68HStz.jpg)


**Case**

The watch is 40mm, but it wears a little bit bigger. This is because (1) the dial is relatively large, (2) even thought he dial and the crystal are round, they are set in a case that is actually kind of tonneau shaped (i.e. rectangle with rounded sides) if you look straight down on it, and (3) the integrated lugs extend out pretty far. 

It has a lot of different edges and layers that are polished to different textures, and the light catches them beautifully. However, all of these joints and bevels get dust caught in them pretty easily.

[crown detail, thickness, integrated lugs](http://i.imgur.com/HYXt9S4.jpg)

[just gorgeous](http://imgur.com/o8omacE)

**Dial**

The dial is matte black. There is an outer chapter ring with minute indicators. Inside that, there are rhodium plated applied hour markers. A nice little detail is that right next to the date at 3 O'clock, they have a miniaturized hour indicator with its own little dot of lume. Inside the hour markers, there is a circle engraved onto the dial. THe hands are wide, straight sword-style. One thing I love about this watch is how supremely legible it is. The minute indicators are widely spaced, making it easy to read time down to the second. Also, the hour indicators are kind of beveled and faceted, so they catch the light and glint in a very pleasing way.

[Dial texture and light refraction](http://i.imgur.com/kkTkGTA.jpg)

**Lume** 

This is one area where I feel the watch is a bit lacking. When I first got the watch, the lume seemed kind of mediocre, but it actually seems like it has been ""broken in"" and now it glows a bit brighter and holds the charge a bit longer. The pictures make the lume look brighter than it actually is. Note also, the tiny little slice of lume next to the date window. The third picture in the album is the most accurate version of how the lume actually looks.

[Lume album](http://imgur.com/a/Eom22)

**Bracelet**

The bracelet is amazing. Unavoidably, it is already getting some minor scratches, but I have been making sure to remove it before using my aluminum macbook, and the scratches don't show very much on the brushed steel. The edges of the bracelet links and the center links are beveled and polished, so when the light hits it, [the outline of the links kind of glimmers](http://i.imgur.com/yz0giF2.jpg). The craziest thing about the bracelet is the high-tech way the links work. Each link has a little circle on it. (see below). The circles are actually buttons that must be held down with a pusher before the pins can be slid out from the side with another pusher. So that is pretty high tech. The downside of this is that there's no way to change the links without scratching the little buttons with the pusher tools. But it's also kind of cool, because the scratched buttons signify the bracelet sized for my wrist only.

Started my journey today into beautiful watches with this bumper automate 1953 stainless steel Omega. Kept on returning to it and finally decided to purchase it. 

It appealed to me with its 'no fuzz' elegant look. Here's a photo of it, i haven't seen too many same model images around.

* Edit: I found this in auction in Finland. The clock history is the dial has been restored in Ohio in 2008, during which the clock in general was given conservative maintenance. The body was given ultrasound wash but not polished. The body is made of three pieces. The clock measures 34x38,2x11 mm and weights 34 grams.

The movement has 17 jewels with F=19 800A/h, its diameter is 28,1mm and height 4,8mm. I'll snap some more pics as i get the kidzillas sleeping. 

The strap is 18mm brown lizard leather with Omega marking in the strap and the buckle.

* Edit2: Added some pictures. Also the size was mentioned, i find the clock size needs to be in proportion to the wearer. Heres how this one is on its bearer http://i.imgur.com/zvTPIyE.jpg

* Edit3: Added the strap picture

1364315191.0,84,self.Watches,1b1re6,"Purchased a [Citizen EcoDrive 2100], AKA the ""Ron Swanson""",Seikoholic,96,12,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1b1re6/purchased_a_citizen_ecodrive_2100_aka_the_ron/,"I broke my long-standing habit of only buying Seiko watches.  We watch ""Parks &amp; Recreation"" and I kept checking out the cool two-tone chrono that Ron Swanson wears.  Finally I saw [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/kwSyfsk.jpg) and decided to hunt it down.  It's a [Citizen EcoDrive 2100](http://i.imgur.com/COybxBm.jpg) and it's a serious chunk of watch.  Solid stainless steel with primarily a brushed finish, but with polished highlights on the bracelet and the bezel.  Initially I was taken aback at the size - a solid 44mm across not counting the crowns - but it's surprisingly comfortable.  

Pros:  legible, functional, comfortable.  Very nice mechanical feel to the buttons, and especially to the chrono reset.  A very solid ""snap"" that I'd normally associate with a non-quartz chrono.  The design is intuitive and functional.  The lume glows a surprising light blue - I'm used to the Seiko green.

Cons: it's just slightly too blingy for me - I wish it were more stripped-down and functional, with an oyster-type bracelet rather than the integrated multi-part that it came with.  On the subject of the bracelet, I'd really have preferred a standard lug design on the watch head so I could try different combos.  As it is, I'm stuck with how it was made.  I also wish that the case diameter was slightly smaller - my sweet spot is between 40-42mm.

All told, I'm delighted to be able to wear Ron's watch.",,False,,t5_2qls5,1364337092.0,,,True,t3_1b1re6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1b1re6/purchased_a_citizen_ecodrive_2100_aka_the_ron/,

1370352641.0,74,self.Watches,1fneu8,"[Watch Photography Guide] Taking better watch photos, it can be done cheaply and easily!",FrancisHC,85,11,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1fneu8/watch_photography_guide_taking_better_watch/,"Hi everyone,

I see a lot of watch pictures here, and I think a lot of people don't realize how easy it is to take better photos, so I thought I'd write a bit of a guide.

Photography gear has come a long, long way in the last decade. A recent-ish point-and-shoot camera can take more detailed photos than a $4000 professional DSLR of 10 years ago. Think about that - you have cheap tools available to you that are better than what the professionals were using just a decade a go! Think about how good those pictures could be!

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/sGtwTK9.jpg) is a high-res photo I just took, and you can do the same with less than $65 of equipment if you follow this recipe:

1. **Get a real camera**. You don't need a fancy SLR, but you should use something that's not also your phone.  It's not impossible, but it's [hard to take](http://i.imgur.com/lNhQzw1.jpg) a good photo with [your phone](http://i.imgur.com/679ASXH.jpg). It's easier to just use a half-way passable camera. I took [my photo](http://i.imgur.com/sGtwTK9.jpg) with an old pocket point and shoot Nikon S8100. You can get a used one on eBay for under $65, and if you don't already own a camera, these are great to have when you're on vacation, visiting the beach or just doing anything memorable. Honestly, these cheap little point &amp; shoot cameras can be better for watch photography than a more expensive DSLR with a kit lens, because the smaller cameras tend to have a smaller minimum focus distance so you can get your camera really close to your watch to capture all that detail. (Edit: [Examples](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1fneu8/watch_photography_guide_taking_better_watch/cac7rgc) showing why using a real camera is better than using a phone.)

2. **Use a tripod**. You don't need an $800 carbon fibre Gitzo, you just need something that will hold your camera still. I used a tripod [just like this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Mini-3-Legs-Compact-Protable-Tripod-UNIVERSAL-for-JV300-SX150-V1-J2-WB630-ES90-/171029188925?pt=US_Tripods&amp;hash=item27d222513d). You should be able to pick up something similar for under $2.

3. **Think about your lighting**. Lots of ambient light is good. On a sunny day, you can take a photo in the morning in a room with a big west-ward facing window. That's what I did. Harsh light, [like from a flash](http://i.imgur.com/8DYJsTZ.jpg), or a desk lamp, is harder to work with. If you want to put more effort into it, you can use a light box. It's not hard or expensive if you want to [build your own](http://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Inexpensive-Photography-Lightbox).

4. **Don't hold the watch in your hand**.  [Your hand is unsteady](http://i.imgur.com/F9uzaHm.jpg), it moves and causes blur and [confuses the auto-focus system](http://i.imgur.com/NC2g0Bl.jpg). Rest it on something steady, like a table or in a watch holder. If you want to take a wrist shot, you can rest your arm on something steady, like a desk or a table.

5. **Make sure you do steps 1-4**. They are absolutely the most import things. Use a camera. Use a tripod. Use good lighting. Don't hold the watch in your hand.

6. **Clean your watch**. Before you take your photo, take a moment to clean your watch. At least rub it with a cloth, get rid [greasy fingerprints](http://i.imgur.com/ScsovL8.jpg), and most of the dust &amp; lint that you'll be able to see now that you're taking a decent photo of your watch.

7. **Set your camera's output**. Make sure your camera is set to give you the biggest most detailed pictures. With my camera, this means setting the output ""12 MP* (4000x3000)"".

8. **Set your camera's ISO**. Put it on the lowest possible setting. Usually somewhere around ISO 100. ISO is a measure of how sensitive your camera is. The more sensitive it is, the noisier it is.

9. **If your camera/lens has an anti-shake feature, turn it off**. It's good at making hand-held shots less blurry, but it makes steady tripod-held shots more blurry.

10. **Set your aperture**. If you have a fancy enthusiast/DSLR camera, set the aperture to something in the middle of the range for the sharpest shot. Something like f/4.8 or f/8. Don't worry if you don't know what this means. I can't even set the aperture on my camera.

11. **Set the focal length (zoom)**. If you have a zoom lens, realize that your lens isn't equally sharp throughout its entire range. For some cameras, it's at its widest possible setting. For others, it's somewhere in the middle of the range. You'll have to experiment. My camera is sharpest at its widest setting. Often, the minimum focus distance is much better the wider you set your lens, so shooting in your widest focal length is the best way to capture the most detail.  Position your watch in the center of your camera's field of view. Camera lenses are designed to be the sharpest at their center. Fill the frame as much as possible that allows your camera to still focus on it, to get the most detail out of your watch. If you don't fill the frame like in [this photo](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/NikonD70/Samples/QualityRes/DSC_0002.jpg), you can make more creative photos, but you will sacrifice detail on your watch. (For comparison, that photo was taken with a 9 year old $1000 enthusiast-level DSLR + $300 prime lens, [my photo](http://i.imgur.com/sGtwTK9.jpg) was taken with a   nearly 3 year old compact camera. You can see how far the technology has come.)

12. **Turn on macro mode** if your camera has it. This allows your camera to focus on very close-up objects.

13. **Set up your scene, and make sure the lighting is right**. Try and position your watch in a way that will pick up the most light, but give off very few reflections. Also, wear pants. More than one eBay photographer has been caught in their underwear in a reflection on their watch. Seriously. **Wear pants**. Edit: If you have a polarizing filter for your camera, this can also be helpful in reducing reflections.

14. **Set the white balance on your photo**. If your photo is lit mostly by incandescent light, use the incandescent light setting on your camera. Usually ""Auto"" mode will be fine.

15. **Use the timer function on your camera** to take a picture. Set it to something like 2 seconds. When you press the shutter button, it makes your camera shake a little bit, which makes your photos blurry. Using the timer function and just letting the tripod hold your camera makes it nice and steady.

16. **That's it!** You've taken a nice picture. If you want to go the extra mile, (I didn't) you can do some post-processing on your photos.  There are many options, but you can edit your photos online with something like [Pixlr](http://pixlr.com/editor/), or if you upload your photos to [Google+](https://plus.google.com) there are some excellent easy-to-use tools to improve your pictures. (By adjusting the contrast, resizing &amp; cropping, correcting for lens distortion, playing with the colour temperature, etc.) Edit: Someone on /r/Watches was [showing me their favourite watch photo](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1hf2d3/wrist_check_the_official_thread_for_monday_july_1/cau7vdy) and I was showing them how you can improve a photo in post. [[Before](http://i.imgur.com/fmPSTqi.jpg)] [[After](http://i.imgur.com/sI4x7EL.jpg)]

Hope someone finds this helpful :)

So after reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/19lynp/casio_gshock_gw3000bb_my_thoughts_after_a_few/) thread, I realised that i needed an aviator style G-Shock. I was debating between getting a GW-3000 and a GW-4000. Overall, the lower profile and dial design made me go for GW-4000. It was a bit of a nightmare to get in the UK at a reasonable price, so ended up having to import it from Italy (it arrived yesterday).

Full technical specs are available [here](http://www.gshock.com/watches/Aviation/GW4000D-1A). They key features for me are the radio controlled time update, the super tough movement and the solar power charging.

My first impressions are that the watch is very high quality (as to be expected from the Aviator range). The watch is very comfortable to wear and very easy to read. The lume is also pretty good. I really love the retrograde style weekday indicator as well as the 24 hour dial. The stopwatch is only 24 minutes, which bothers some people, but I can't imagine myself using it for long periods of time really (maybe for cooking?).

I'm still not 100% convinced with the metal bracelet and am considering buying a replacement resin strap.

The pictures don't really do the watch justice. The dial is slightly translucent, textured and more 3D than it looks in photos. A lot of people complain about the dial markings being not very visible, but I haven't found this to be the case. Also, the watch wears nicely on my 7"" wrist - although it is a big watch, it doesn't feel silly (this is probably helped by the flatter profile). 

Overall, I'm very pleased and can see myself wearing this daily for quite some time (especially if i pick up a resin strap). If you've got any questions or would like some more pictures then let me know.

I contacted a few AD's in and around NYC and got prices from $4,300 and up. I also checked out [AuthenticWatches](http://www.authenticwatches.com/professional.html) which had it available for $3,495. Unfortunately that was a bit out of my range so I decided to go the second hand route.

Luckily for me [Kringkily](http://forums.watchuseek.com/member.php?u=116866), a well known seller on many watch forums had a mint condition 2012 Omega Speedmaster Professional cal 1861 with box and papers available for a very reasonable price (sub $3,000).

I picked up the watch from him last night in person and true to his word the watch was in excellent condition. I switched the original Omega bracelet for a Hadley-Roma dark brown calfskin strap (see the last photo) while I hunt for a good condition Omega leather strap. I think the dark brown leather looks pretty good!

One of the most common questions asked here is ""Please help me find a watch"", with relatively minor variations. We thought it would good to create a more comprehensive resource for /r/Watches, and create the Official /r/Watches Buying Guide.

We will structure the buying guide similarly to the /r/Watches Brand Guide. Once every two weeks, we will post a thread asking for the /r/Watches community to offer suggestions for watch purchases.

In each thread, we will solicit watch suggestions by price, in the following categories:
[$0-250](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/tg0hc/rwatches_official_buying_guide_us0250/), [$250-$500](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/u0ze8/rwatches_official_buying_guide_us250500/), $500-$1000, $1000-$2000, $2000-$10000, $10000+

The price class is in US dollars, and refers to the street price (cost of acquisition) of the watch, not the suggested retail price.

In addition, we will have one watch suggestion thread for ladies' watches, with an open price class, and a thread for watch accessory recommendations. (eg. winders, straps, tools.) 

These threads will be linked in the [/r/Watches FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/watches#TherWatchesOfficialBuyingGuide) for future reference.

This week, we are asking you to to offer suggestions on $500-$1000 watches.

**For readability, please structure your suggestions like this: (One suggestion per comment)**

*****


**[brand &amp; watch name]**

Price: [price in US dollars, used and new]

Movement: [quartz/automatic/mechanical/auto-quartz/solar-powered quartz/electric]

Style: [dress, sports, sports-elegance, diver, pilot, fashion, outdoors, pocketwatch]

Size: [size of the watch, mm for wrist-watches (specify with or without the crown), movement size for pocket watches]

Link: [URL to manufacturer/fan webpage, imgur album, youtube video or google image search]

Description: [Write a few words about why this is an excellent choice of a watch]

(If there is a movement/style that is not listed that makes a more appropriate description of the watch, feel free to use it. For example, an IWC Portuguese Chronograph might be referred to as a ""dress chronograph"")


**For example:**
*****

**Vintage LeCoultre Memovox**

Price: ~$600-1500 (vintage)

Movement: Mechanical

Style: Vintage Dress Watch

Size: 36mm

Link: [Imgur Gallery (Mirror of eBay Listing)](http://imgur.com/a/hr2sI)

Description:

This suggestion exists mostly to illustrate to the reader that there are some tremendously good deals if you're willing to consider vintage watches.

The linked example is a LeCoultre Memovox, a classic example of Swiss watchmaking, with an unusual and useful alarm complication. To this day, the Memovox is somewhat of a signature complication for the highly heralded brand, Jaeger-LeCoultre.

A classic watch with its own personality, an interesting and well-finished movement, from a well-respected Swiss house, for an excellent price.

Unlike a new/modern watch, vintage pieces are fully depreciated, and will retain their value should you choose to resell it in the future.

Generally, you wouldn't want to go much further back than around 1950 in a vintage watch, because prior to this era, shock protection wasn't as common a feature on wrist watches. (It should be noted, though, the above linked watch does not have shock protection.)

I recommend either purchasing a watch that has been recently serviced, or budgeting $150+ for a watchmaker to service it.

*****

If you are considering a mechanical watch, remember that the recommended service interval is approximately once every 5 years. A good watchmaker will probably want $150+ to service it, more if it is a complicated watch. (eg. has a chronograph.) If you are purchasing a new watch, you will be lucky if it is worth half of what you paid in 5 years. You should consider the total cost of ownership when choosing your watch.

*****
Remember, **one suggestion per comment, please make multiple comments for multiple suggestions.** Thanks!

If you disagree with someone, please debate them, don't downvote them. The purpose of these discussion threads is to encourage discussion, so people can read different opinions to get different ideas and perspectives on how people view these watches. Downvoting without giving a counter-perspective is not helpful to anybody, and will earn you super looks of disapproval from everyone else. ಠ_ಠ

I didn't like the ugly nylon strap so I relaced it with a Hirsch strap. The watch feels very solid. The dial is large and easy to read. The lume is very bright (for now) and it doesn't seem to be losing that much time (I haven't measured it exactly yet).

Well I have been lusting after this watch for a while now, pretty much since the first time I saw it. I told my self I need a blue dial watch at some point as it is my favorite color and I feel like Christopher Wards blue on the new C60s is just perfect. Not nearly as dark as what you usually see on blue dial but not bright to the point of being flashy.


I don't think she had planned on giving it to me as usually she is adamently opposed to early gifts. However my Orient Star Somes I received Saturday from Seiya was having issues and had to be shipped back to Japan today to be checked out. As it turns out the C60 arrived in the mail today, so she felt pitied me and we exchanged gifts early.

The watch is even better in person. The blue is beautiful and changes with lighting. The textured dial is flawless and overall ChrWard's attention to detail is superb. The signed crown is nice and screws down very smooth. The leather strap is high quality and the deployant works flawlessly (also easy to adjust). I will probably order the bracelet in the near future for some versatility and I have been told their bracelets are well made. One nice thing about ChrWard is that you don't get gouged on the straps/bracelets. So it really doesn't matter which you order with the watch if you want both because the costs ends up the same.

This watch has already become my favorite in just a few short hours.

1362733486.0,76,self.Watches,19wjql,"After months of careful consideration, got my new Tangente Datum",ziller,83,7,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/19wjql/after_months_of_careful_consideration_got_my_new/,"Album for the impatient: http://imgur.com/a/2Aqq1

Last week I (finally) bought a Nomos Tangente Datum at their [Zürich flagship store](http://www.nomos-schweiz.ch/en/). I actually originally went there just to compare sizes (Tangente vs Tangente Datum vs Tangente Datum Gangreserve), with a firm belief that I'd buy one earliest next month. Perhaps in two months. My spouse, however, managed to convince me at the store that I need to buy it right on the spot. Apparently I'd otherwise just be obsessing over it for yet another month. The sales person didn't oppose the idea and the price was exactly the same as in [the Nomos online store](http://www.nomos-store.com/en/Watches/Tangente/Watches-with-manual-winding/Tangente-Datum-sapphire-crystal-back.html), so I thought ""why not"".

I deliberately went for a handwound watch. And I was planning to get it as my daily beater, so that pretty much ruled the non-date version out. I was initially very concerned that the 37.5mm size of the Datum would be too big and almost got the [35mm Gangreserve version](http://www.nomos-store.com/en/Watches/Tangente/Watches-with-manual-winding-and-power-reserve-indicator/Tangente-Datum-Gangreserve-red-sapphire-crystal-back.html), without the long distance date, instead. But the dial on that one looked slightly disproportionate; the date window was shorter than the numerals, the small seconds sub-dial was too small and the Nomos logo was offset oddly. So I went for the bigger one, just for the cleaner looks alone. I'm still not 100% sure that it's not too big for my wrist, but I think I can live with it.

My first impressions after purchasing it: *it's so thin*! And comfortable! My previous daily wearer was a Tissot automatic and I had slowly started to get properly annoyed at its size (11mm thick) and the weight (you could actually feel it weighing your wrist down). The Nomos, at 6.6mm, is hardly thicker than its leather band. It's unobtrusive, lightweight, yet solid and sturdy. Just a pleasure to wear. The leather band is amazing too. I went for the brown one instead of the default black, which felt a bit too formal for my taste.

The (in-house) movement is beautifully finished and so far every bit as accurate as expected: on average +1.5 sec/day, wearing it for roughly 16 hours at a time. Still experimenting a bit with how to store it overnight, but apparently it really doesn't make any significant difference at all.

Can't find anything negative to say about it. Even winding it is a pleasure. Definitely worth every penny I invested in it.",,False,,t5_2qls5,False,,,True,t3_19wjql,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/19wjql/after_months_of_careful_consideration_got_my_new/,

I recently ran a giveaway on [/r/malefashionadvice](/r/malefashionadvice) - now it's time for [/r/watches](/r/watches) turn.

I'm giving away 5 nato straps from my company ([www.straply.me](http://www.straply.me)) to the members of this subreddit - first things first, to sign up go here : http://bit.ly/rwatches . I promise not to sell your email addresses to chinese teenage hackers. Make sure to fill out your top 3 straps and that you're coming from [/r/watches](/r/watches) on the signup form after you confirm your email.



company background follows : 
I recently was in the [market for NATO straps](http://i.imgur.com/b23fI.jpg) and was disappointed with the shopping experience. They were either overpriced (15-30$, looking at you Jcrew) or terrible quality, so I decided to start my own shop, at [www.straply.me](http://www.straply.me). I spent a month or so buying, researching, and contacting suppliers and have found one that manufactures to a standard I'm happy with. Our straps are sturdy, woven nylon with adjustment holes that are punched and sealed in two steps instead of just one to prevent any fraying, and finished with 316L surgical grade stainless steel hardware. They're $10 each and right now I'll do free shipping if you buy two.

If you're impatient or unlucky, you can always support a fellow redditor by picking up a strap or two. I look forward to seeing these straps in the wild and on this subreddit!

Good Luck!

The seller is a neat little watch shop in Osaka, Japan who mainly deals with the in Japan ever so popular Rolex brand. The seller kindly serviced the watch before shipping.

Even now I am astonished I purchased a watch from 1969 (the year man set foot on the moon!) and that the watch is actually 44 years old! Still, the watch is in great condition. 
If you look very closely, you can see small scratches on the case, but nothing that bothers me.

One of the most common questions asked here is ""Please help me find a watch"", with relatively minor variations. We thought it would good to create a more comprehensive resource for /r/Watches, and create the Official /r/Watches Buying Guide.

We will structure the buying guide similarly to the /r/Watches Brand Guide. Once every two weeks, we will post a thread asking for the /r/Watches community to offer suggestions for watch purchases.

In each thread, we will solicit watch suggestions by price, in the following categories:
[$0-250](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/tg0hc/rwatches_official_buying_guide_us0250/), $250-$500, $500-$1000, $1000-$2000, $2000-$10000, $10000+

The price class is in US dollars, and refers to the street price (cost of acquisition) of the watch, not the suggested retail price.

In addition, we will have one watch suggestion thread for ladies' watches, with an open price class, and a thread for watch accessory recommendations. (eg. winders, straps, tools.) 

These threads will be linked in the [/r/Watches FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/watches#TherWatchesOfficialBuyingGuide) for future reference.

This week, we are asking you to to offer suggestions on $250-$500 watches.

**For readability, please structure your suggestions like this: (One suggestion per comment)**

**[brand &amp; watch name]**

Price: [price in US dollars, used and new]

Movement: [quartz/automatic/mechanical/auto-quartz/solar-powered quartz/electric]

Description:

I believe the Seagull 1963 is the most interesting new watch you can buy for under $300. It's a mechanical chronograph with an in-house movement, and a watch with genuine history of its own. (See links for a more detailed explanation.)

The Seagull 1963 is available in a variety of options, including acrylic, mineral and sapphire crystal options, as well as a solid and display back, in addition to various strap options.

My first was purchased for me by my mother. It was a black Casio digital on sale at big 5 sporting goods. Unfortunately I don't know the model anymore.    


- When I was in jr high, I purchased my first watch. I saved up my money and got a quicksilver analogue/digital from a surf shop. It came on a rubber strap and when that tore, I got a replacement bracelet from sears. The lug width is 22mm and the bracelet seems to be 20mm. Quality of the watch was pretty poor, the bezel would often pop off and the metal on the underside of the pushers completely corroded away.
http://imgur.com/RqaeNhQ    



- My next watch was a titanium fossil chronograph. The clasp on the bracelet broke after just a few months. Picture from the web
http://imgur.com/58blvxA    



- Next was a citizen skyhawk titanium. This was my first solar and I wore it for years without any issues. Very well built watch. Image from web
http://imgur.com/XWgqtll    



---This is when I discovered WUS---    



- First up is a luminox. I had discovered wus but I still hadn't discovered manual wind and automatic watches yet. This watch took a beating and just kept going. No complaints 
http://imgur.com/1cShOG8    



- I really loved the tritium vials of the luminox and graduated to a Marathon TSAR. This was a huge jump in quality from all the watches I had previously owned. The TSAR is unbelievably solid and tough.
http://imgur.com/JyGiHV2    



- Next is the fortis pilot professional. I absolutely love this watch but eventually sold it because it was a little small for me. If fortis made this watch 42-44mm I would buy it in a heartbeat. 
http://imgur.com/dGTGfXb    



- Stowa marine original. Absolutely gorgeous with a beautifully decorated movement. 
http://imgur.com/3dIwm1b    



- Suunto core for heavy outdoor use. Great ABC features. Sunrise and sunset times were handy for going out and taking pictures. I had an issue with the battery life and sent the watch back to suunto. They fedex'ed me a brand new watch free of charge...great service.
http://imgur.com/Ae0bo4q    



- I went through a panerai phase but couldn't bring myself to spend the money on one. I got 2 ""homages"" from JOA but ended up never wearing them because I didn't feel comfortable with it. Living in so cal I see panerai's semi regularly. I didn't want someone to get the impression that I was wearing a fake. 
http://imgur.com/uwO3voA    


- One that I really regret seling. A Laco WUS project watch.
http://imgur.com/Xt6gwVe    


- My first real ""luxury"" watch...omega po 45mm. This watch was worth every penny. Absolutely wonderful to wear. It was on the omega bracelet normally and on the omega rubber while in the water. 
http://imgur.com/JxxTyHj    



- Luminox blackout. I didn't keep this one long but am still a fan of the all black look. Wore it on a black zulu with low light hardware. 
http://imgur.com/NB7F551    



- I sold my suunto core to get the casio paw 1500yj. No complaints with the suunto but I need to see the seconds on the main screen for my work. This is one of the 3 watches I have in my current collection. I'll keep it until it dies. Tough watch with great abc features as well as atomic syncing. 
http://imgur.com/t32o0wm    



- Disney Micky Mouse quartz. Gift from a friend who is now my gf. It doesn't get much wrist time but it has great sentimental value. 
http://imgur.com/CkdgdUP    



- My precious. The Longines Legend Diver no date. I have been in love with this watch since the first time I saw it on wus. I finally bought myself one for my birthday this year. I wear it on a black brady strap with rhd deployant clasp or if I'm doing something that requires something more rugged, I wear it on a black zulu.

1354293355.0,66,self.Watches,1422jn,A discussion about r/watches,adamscottama,85,19,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1422jn/a_discussion_about_rwatches/,"Inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1412qj/for_a_poor_college_kid_i_think_i_did_pretty_well/) and several other I've seen on here like it, I thought I'd get the ball rolling with a discussion about r/watches as a whole and my own personal views on etiquette etc. Now don't worry, this isn't going to be a ""why can't we all just get along"" post.

First off, I've seen the phrase ""watch snob"" thrown around on here quite a bit recently, and while there may be snobbish people on this subreddit, I don't think r/watches as a whole is for watch snobs. I believe the people on here just value quality (at any price point) over fashion. Which is why Seiko/Citizen/Orient are usually just as well received as Rolex/Omega/Tag Heuer. Just because your watch got downvoted to hell, doesn't make everyone else a snob.

Second, I do think there is room for disagreements and even arguments on this subreddit. That's how people learn about diff brands, movements, features etc. But that being said, there's no need to go out of your way to be a dick. I personally hate NATO straps, a lot of y'all love them and that's fine. But if I see a post that says NATO in the title, I simply move on. There's really no need to go start a war with the NATO fans. Same thing can apply to different watch brands. There's a difference between having an honest disagreement and commenting on someone's post just to tell them their watch is shit. Which brings me to my third point.

Third, if you post anything on here, you have to accept that some people aren't going to like it. Some people aren't going to like this post, and that's ok. You can't get your feelings hurt and be mad because not everyone who comments has something nice to say. This is after all the internet. No one forced you to post anything, you did that all on your own. And especially if you just post a pic of your watch and say ""what does r/watches think?"" without even bothering to do a write up of the watch and give us some more info. If you do that, you really do invite all of r/watches to say whatever they want about your piece. Even if I don't like the watch, I can at least appreciate the people who take the time to do a proper post and tell us their story, tell us about the watch etc.

These are just some of my opinions and observations. I'd love to hear r/watches thoughts about this subreddit and their opinions on etiquette, likes/dislikes, etc.

**Edit:** I wasn't picking on the OP of the discussion I linked to. I was simply using him as an example because his was the most recent post that I saw that ignited a small war.

i bought the watch off ebay for $150, it was not it working condition and i took a bit of a gamble (it was a buy it now so i had to act quick)

the seller was not a professional so i thought the watch was simply old and would run again after a service. the other factor why i bought the watch is because it has a steel case with a simple geometry, so it can be polished without destroying the original design. 

and i was right, after a cleanup the watch runs very well, high amplitude, and around -2/2 spd.

it was a very good buy, the dail is almost perfect, the lume has a nice vanilla to it and even the crystal was still the original (small omega logo in the middle)

the case was pretty scratched and it took more than a polishing, i used sandpaper to grind out most of the marks and tried to replicate the original texture. 

the crystal has a big chunk missing aswell, but because it is plastic all the scratches are gone. 

here are some befor/after pics:

http://imgur.com/a/BRHb5

i can post more pics showing the process if you are interested. 

i only wear it as my dresswatch so it does not get a lot of wristtime, but it is the watch i feel most connected to, especially since i spend many hours restoring it :D


**edit:** i uploaded the pics i took during the refurbishing of the case, i hope they are self-explanatory, if not, just ask.

Omega argued that their copyrighted symbol on the watch gave them the right to exclusive control of import/export rights under [US code] (http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/602)

The 9th Circuit of Appeals ruled against Costco's argument that [First Sale Doctrine] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine) allowed them to import Omega branded goods without permission of the manufacturer.

The Supreme Court granted cert, but split 4-4 with Justice Kagan recusing herself. This left the 9th Circuits opinion standing.

A few days ago they took another bite at the apple in a case where a student was buying textbooks overseas and reselling in the US for a good-sized profit.

Announcing their decision in [Kirtsaeng v. Wiley] (http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf). on Tuesday, the Supreme Court has said that the First Sale Doctrine DOES apply to goods legally purchased, regardless of geography.

Essentially this means that unless congress takes some action to change the law, companies like Costco can leverage their purchasing power overseas to purchase copyrighted material and resell in the US, without need of the copyright holder's permission.

This is my Festina Watch, it does not look like much but it is my most precious and loved belonging. I never leave the house without it.  
This is the story how I got it and why it means everything to me.  
In 1995 (I was 12) my parents got divorced and I never saw my dad again. In 2004 he died of a stroke, his death was unnoticed for more than 3 weeks, finally I was noticed by the police and inspected his apartment. He had almost nothing, only a few pieces of furniture, no books, no pictures.  
I found this watch sitting on his bedstand and I remembered how I saw him wear it during the time my mom and he were together (maybe my memory fools me, it does not look this old).
So I took it, it is my only thing to remind me of him, he was a ship-captain and this watch was with him on every journey he ever undertook during his years on sea.  
I would and probably will at some point go to great length to get it repaired and cleaned. But till now it runs like a charm :-)  
But the story is not over...  
In 2010 my mom died of cancer and since then this watch became my reminder of mom and dads good and happy times. Sometimes it is crazy how this works but everytime I look at my watch I am flooded with images from my childhood and I take a few seconds to ponder what was lost through time.  
There you have it, a simple watch becoming so much more.

1365611201.0,69,self.Watches,1c2kiv,[META] Some feedback analysis and new proposals for the community,spedmonkey,80,11,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1c2kiv/meta_some_feedback_analysis_and_new_proposals_for/,"Hi there, everyone. As you all probably know, we posted a [feedback thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1bj93s/meta_feedback_threadsurvey_for_the_recent/) about a week ago about the changes we've made to the subreddit. There's a few things about the results. First of all, we only got about 120 responses on the survey, which is rather disappointing, given that we have over 20,000 subscribers. Also, judging by the stats, a few of you took advantage of the fact that Google Drive surveys let you take them as many times as you want. Tsk, tsk.

In spite of that, the stats correlated pretty well with the feedback in the discussion thread: there was a pretty even split between people who liked one or more of the changes and people who didn't. In spite of several accusations that we were just going to keep going with our plans regardless of what the community wanted, we've got some changes we'd like to suggest for your consideration.

First, the change that the fewest people had problems with was using a moderator bot to screen submissions, both to reduce the workload on our live mods and to ensure that people read through our FAQ. So, we're going to be keeping a bot, but not AutoModerator - /u/gleam has scripted /u/WatchesBot for us, which will handle things from now on. This brings me to the next issue - the infamous bracket rule. Reaction to this one was a bit more mixed. We looked into other ways of doing things, but one suggestion in the thread seemed like a good compromise for us to try - keeping brackets, but making them uniformly at the beginning of post titles only. Hopefully this will cut down on some of the visual noise that people didn't like, but we'll see what people think.

Lastly, there's the self-post rule. As we all know, that was the most hotly contested one, in both the comments and the survey. That too had very close results, and seemed to be the one that people were the most passionate about. I will reiterate here that me and most of the mods felt that there was a big improvement to post quality thanks to self-posts-only, and we weren't the only ones that felt that way. Nonetheless, we're going to bring back link posts, on the condition that people still do provide a write-up of some sort, as was required with self-posts, and we think that's a fair compromise to the people who want to see more in-depth content and people who just like using RES to look at pictures on the front page. The bot will automatically scan picture posts, and once it finds a comment from the OP, it'll automatically approve the posts. I know some prefer to put their information in imgur albums themselves, and that's perfectly fine as well; the bot can't parse those types of posts though, so if you do decide to go this route, please just message the mods and we'll approve it forthwith.

So, that's the approach we'd like to try. These changes will go into effect at midnight EDT tonight (Wednesday). Like last time, we'll wait a week or two and then post another feedback thread to see how everyone feels about them. Thanks as always for your patience and for how passionate you are about this community, and if you have any additional suggestions, please let us know here or by PMing the mods.

Do they make a specific watch you love? Do you own any that you are proud to show off?

For reference: Casio, Tissot or Omega would be considered well known.. I am interested in hearing about smaller manufacturers who /r/watches thinks are high quality yet not likely known outside of the watch collector circle. An example might be a smaller German or Swiss watch company.

**EDIT**:
Its a lot to look through so I am going to try and summarize this up here. This will be updated as new posts come in. Would it be helpful to list them by price or break them up some way so people quickly know the difference between the price of an Android and FP Journe?

1362325987.0,69,self.Watches,19kvjm,"r/watches, can we have an honest discussion about the difference between an homage and a knockoff?",Gdwg,83,14,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/19kvjm/rwatches_can_we_have_an_honest_discussion_about/,"Here's a basic example to hopefully spark the discussion:

I commonly see the Steinhart Ocean 1 referred to as a Rolex Submariner ""homage.""
Example: http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/z7d4k/smallernormal_sized_rolex_sub_homage_with/
Watch: http://www.steinhartwatches.de/en/OCEAN-1-BLACK,14.html

While the Invicta Pro Diver is often referred to as a ""knockoff"" of the Rolex Submariner. ""Knockoff"" having a much more negative connotation than ""homage.""
Example: http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/19knzu/what_do_you_think_about_this_watch_invicta_pro/ 
Watch: http://www.amazon.com/Invicta-Diver-Collection-Automatic-Watch/dp/B0006AAS4M

Now I fully understand the difference in quality of the two watch brands (Invicta of inconsistent/low quality, Steinhart of great quality). 

What irks me is that some members of the watch community scoff at Invicta for copying Rolex, while at the same time deifying Steinhart for their great homage to the brand.

On a basic level, however, they are both mimicking the design of the Rolex Submariner. So, why refer to them differently? Is it simply personal bias of the user?

I would appreciate it if someone could shed some light on this distinction.

EDIT: Great discussion r/watches. I've been moving all day and I'm pleasantly surprised by all of your thoughtful replies. Good job keeping comments on the level (i.e. not turning into Bitch Fest 2013).",,False,,t5_2qls5,1362377342.0,,,True,t3_19kvjm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/19kvjm/rwatches_can_we_have_an_honest_discussion_about/,

We have some guidelines for these types of posts in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/watches#Ifaskingforawatchrecommendationeitherforyourselforasagift:), but as a refresher, here's the salient points:

**If asking for a watch recommendation, either for yourself or as a gift:**

- Give us some idea of what the recipient will want it for (work, weekends, special occasions, everything in general, etc).

- What's the recipient's wrist size? If you don't know the recipient's wrist size, describe their size/build/appearance.

- Your budget

- Take a look through the [Buying Guide](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/watches#TherWatchesOfficialBuyingGuide) at your preferred price point and let us know what catches your eye and what you do and don't like about it.

- Are there any other special criteria you'd like it to meet? Common ones include specific brands, nation of origin, complications/features, or movement types. See the rest of the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/watches) if you'd like some more ideas.

**If giving purchasing advice:**

- Listen to what the watch purchaser wants, and recommend something appropriate for them. This is not the time to repeatedly suggest whatever your favourite watch is, just because it's on your mind. Your favourite watch is not a good match for every recipient. For example, quartz is probably a more appropriate choice than a mechanical watch for most people.

- Be nice. There will be a lot of first-time watch buyers here, who may or may not know anything about brands, models, or market trends. Just because you hate a brand or model does not give you permission to flame someone for asking about it.

- In a similar vein to the previous point, if you disagree with another poster's suggestion, please say *why*. Again, people are coming to us for advice, and giving them more information to make an informed decision is the purpose of this exercise. Simply flaming or downvote-bombing someone else for suggesting a watch you don't like is not productive.

I know a majority of this community is not a huge fan of buying advice threads, and that's OK. If you are one of these people, however, please don't flame the threads. Just ignore them and enjoy the rest of the content here - in a few weeks things will be back to normal (after the wave of ""Look what I got for Christmas!"" posts, of course).

As always, thank you guys (and girls) for being, in large part, an awesome group of people. This is a hectic time of year; please stay courteous to each other and to new users. Hope you all have happy holidays, and may all your gifts be grails. :)",,False,,t5_2qls5,False,,,True,t3_146hup,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/146hup/giftgiving_time_is_upon_us_so_please_observe_good/,moderator

It has a good weight and looks really good imo. Because the Saphir glas is flat it doesnt really look thick. Its thinner then all my other automatic watches. If you want me to make a pic from a specific angle or something just tell me.
Im thinking about getting a different leather strap since this one might be a little bit to big.

[Breitling Superocean Heritage](http://i.imgur.com/cIJ8L58.jpg?1)

A quick backstory: both of these belonged to my dad. He passed away and I inherited them. 

I really like the Breitling, although I couldn't stand to wear it with the mesh bracelet my dad had it on, so I changed it out for the rubber strap pictured here. It has so much more weight to it than the Rolex, so much so that when I switch to the Rolex I am constantly checking to make sure the watch is still on my wrist. I am not the biggest Breitling fan in general, but this one obviously has a lot of sentimental value to me. I get more compliments on it than I do the Rolex, but I attribute that to the size. 

As much as I like the Breitling, if I had to choose only one it would undoubtedly be the GMT. It might have something to do with the fact that I recall adoring it on my dad's wrist as a 5 year old. When my dad was still around, he would switch watches every month and I started out doing the same. Although I hate to say it, I find it hard switching back to the Breitling, I'd really rather wear the Rolex. As I said, I get more compliments on the Breitling than on the Rolex, and I prefer the ""under the radar"" aspect of the Rolex as compared to the Breitling - unless someone is into watches, chances are the Rolex goes unnoticed. I also love the versatility of the watch - I can easily dress it up and wear a suit with it, or I can dress it down and beat the hell out of it while swimming, skiing, etc.

""Seiko 5"" is a little piece of marketing flair that Seiko has used since the 60s on watches from basic dress watches, to 25j hacking JDM dress watches, to 6139 and 6138 chronographs, to sport divers.  

For a poster to hate on ""Seiko 5"" is to demonstrate that the poster doesn't understand Seiko.  While this flair can mean a low-end watch, it can also mean a very rare early JDM speedtimer subvariant that only a few people have ever seen.  

Finally, here are the five reasons for ""Seiko 5"":

1. Diaflex (unbreakable mainspring), 
2. Diashock (Seiko's shock resistant design, equivalent to the Swiss ""Incabloc""), 
3. Automatic winding, 
4. day/date indication, and 
5. Water resistant. 

it's a mark of Seiko's quality, durability, &amp; utility.  It's a sign of their commitment to producing a solid product designed for everyday use.  If a poster is going to deride something, then they should make sure to take the time to understand what they are sneering at.

| X | 1 | 2 | X |

| 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

1) **Citizen BM7193-07** | [My picture](http://i.imgur.com/Dqh032eh.jpg) | [Buy Link](http://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Mens-BM7193-07B-Eco-Drive-Watch/dp/B00843L74S/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375589236&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=rose+gold+citizen+eco+drive) | Price: $170 | Overall: 7/10 | This watch is an absolutely beautiful dress watch. As an Eco-Drive, it is very reliable and I never need to worry about setting the time (though I do need to set the date, and haven't recently as the picture reveals). However, it is too dressy to get much wear time, and if I were to want it for a formal occasion I would surely have enough time to set it since prep for formal events takes a while anyways. So while it is great, it may have been a bit too dressy for my needs, but I would recommend it to anyone looking for a dress watch (mineral crystal seems fine for dress watches, assuming you don't go crazy at formal events).

2) **Green Orient World Time** | [My awful picture](http://i.imgur.com/IsWHzHHh.jpg) | ~~Buy Link~~ | Price: ~$75 | Overall: 6/10 |
This one is a recent addition, and the green really is more pretty than expected. I haven't worn it recently (once again, revealed by the date) since it feels slightly large for me, but it keeps time well and what else can you ask for? I don't have much to say about it, since I haven't had enough time yet to really evaluate it.

3) **2013 Maratac Mid Pilot** | [My picture](http://i.imgur.com/jWlt0tdh.jpg) | [Buy Link](http://www.countycomm.com/midpilot2013.html) | Price: ~$325 | Overall: 9/10 | This watch was pretty expensive, given what it used to be. When I got it, the first thing I did was switch it to a Stowa leather strap because the canvas seemed to make the watch too plain. The rotor is fairly quiet, and is only noticeable if it is very quiet and you're trying to hear it. It feels larger than it is for just a 39mm watch, but that's what Maratac is known for. I bought it at $239, but with shipping and taxes in California it ended up around $280, and at that price point I would say it is worth it, but you're not getting any sort of spectacular deal. It gets worn fairly often, and gets a good amount of complements. 

4) **Citizen Stiletto** | [My awful picture](http://i.imgur.com/Ajrznbqh.jpg) | [Buy Link](http://www.amazon.com/Citizen-AR1120-50E-Stiletto-Drive-Watch/dp/B0050SB6BE/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375590253&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=citizen+stilleto) | Price: $320 | Overall: 9/10 | This watch is also fantastic, coming in at 5mm thick and 36mm in diameter. It's a perfect executive watch for those of us with this wrists, and it has sapphire crystal to help it take some hits. The face is beautifully simple, and the lack of a seconds hand is something I do enjoy. I find this one being worn often, and it also gets a good deal of complements.

5) **Christopher Ward C7 Rapide MK I** | [My awful picture](http://i.imgur.com/xVZXLach.jpg) | [new model Buy Link](http://www.christopherward-usa.com/men/sport/c7mk2.html) | Price: $230 | Overall: 9/10 | I bought this one when Chris Ward was having their summer sale to clear their old inventory, and I managed to grab the last one they had. Let me just say, their customer service was incredibly helpful and this watch blew me away as a fantastic deal. It was $230 shipped for a Swiss Quartz chronograph with sapphire crystal &amp; an AR coating backed by a 5 year warranty. Their presentation of the watch, and the papers it came with helped back this up. It looks stunning in person, and I'm looking forward to wearing it often in the future since it just came in. It may be slightly larger than my usual, but it isn't a problem.

6) **Rodina Small Seconds** | [My picture](http://i.imgur.com/bXMPcGSh.jpg) | [Buy Link](http://forums.watchuseek.com/f71/affordable-nomos-homage-review-rodina-small-seconds-pictures-752788.html) | Price: $120 | Overall: 8/10 | The Rodina is exactly what it looks like, a Chinese copy of the Nomos/Stowa/everyone-else-with-this-style. Aka it is a beautiful watch, and the sapphire crystal, display back, and automatic movement make it a great deal. I'm also glad they at least put their own name on it &amp; took possession of it instead of doing an actual replica. However, it is a Chinese watch with iffy quality control, and mine is no exception. There are a couple specks on the dial that came on it, and I cannot remove them without getting inside, which is not something I can do. I'm sure I can go get this cleaned at my local shop for a bit, but it doesn't bother me at all. However, I felt the iffy quality control was worth mentioning. That being said, I would highly recommended, and have recommended it to many people. This watch is a great value, however I'd say the Chris Ward was a better value.

Look at the satin finish on the clasp. That is when I really know someone never wore it.

Watches like these are why I started collecting vintage Seiko.  Not just the ground-breaking vertical column clutch movement, not just the durability of the design, but the amazing styling cues and attention to detail.

A new budget automatic watch made by Swatch that will be affordable to most watch enthusiasts.

Here are some features:

* Price of 130 Swiss Francs.
* Power reserve of 90 hours.
* Made with only 51 pieces.
* No manual adjustments needed by the watchmaker.
* Made with copper alloy, nickel and zinc.
* Antimagnetic.
* Watch is hermetically sealed.
* Movement welded together.
* 100% made in Switzerland.

This is also an awesome innovation:

&gt;Sistem51 is a world first: it is the only mechanical movement ever made whose assembly is 100% automated. The high-tech escapement has no regulator; the rate is set at the factory with a laser, making the manual rate adjustments normally required by a mechanical watch unnecessary. The movement features a 90 hour power reserve.

It's from 1865.  When I first researched it I was positive the serial number was 1xxxxx, looking at the pictures it looks like 7xxxxx which would make it from 1874.  The watch is in a safe now so I can't look at it to verify.

One of the most common questions asked here is ""Please help me find a watch"", with relatively minor variations. We thought it would good to create a more comprehensive resource for /r/Watches, and create the Official /r/Watches Buying Guide.

We will structure the buying guide similarly to the /r/Watches Brand Guide. Once every two weeks, we will post a thread asking for the /r/Watches community to offer suggestions for watch purchases.

In each thread, we will solicit watch suggestions by price, in the following categories:
[$0-250](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/tg0hc/rwatches_official_buying_guide_us0250/), [$250-$500](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/u0ze8/rwatches_official_buying_guide_us250500/), [$500-$1000](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/unvj3/rwatches_official_buying_guide_us5001000/), $1000-$2000, $2000-$10000, $10000+

The price class is in US dollars, and refers to the street price (cost of acquisition) of the watch, not the suggested retail price.

In addition, we will have one watch suggestion thread for ladies' watches, with an open price class, and a thread for watch accessory recommendations. (eg. winders, straps, tools.) 

These threads will be linked in the [/r/Watches FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/watches#TherWatchesOfficialBuyingGuide) for future reference.

This week, we are asking you to to offer suggestions on $500-$1000 watches.

**For readability, please structure your suggestions like this: (One suggestion per comment)**

Description:

This suggestion exists mostly to illustrate to the reader that there are some very interesting watches if you're willing to consider used or vintage watches.

In this price class, we're starting to get into some truly iconic timepieces. Rolex is famous for popularizing the wrist watch, designing the first modern automatic winding system, chronometer-grade timekeeping in a wristwatch, and developing the first modern waterproof watch. The Datejust represents all of these innovations, all in an elegant and understated, but iconic package.

The linked example is a Rolex Datejust 16030 with a cal. 3035 quickset movement. This Datejust is an excellent example of the timeless nature of Rolex design - its contemporary looks are virtually identical to the Datejust when it was introduced in 1945, all the way through to the Datejusts of today.

Unlike a new/modern watch, vintage pieces are fully depreciated, and will retain their value should you choose to resell it in the future.

Generally, you wouldn't want to go much further back than around 1950 in a vintage watch, because prior to this era, shock protection wasn't as common a feature on wrist watches.

I recommend either purchasing a watch that has been recently serviced, or budgeting $150+ for a watchmaker to service it.

*****

If you are considering a mechanical watch, remember that the recommended service interval is approximately once every 5 years. A good watchmaker will probably want $150+ to service it, more if it is a complicated watch. (eg. has a chronograph.) If you are purchasing a new watch, you will be lucky if it is worth half of what you paid in 5 years. You should consider the total cost of ownership when choosing your watch.

If you disagree with someone, please debate them, don't downvote them. The purpose of these discussion threads is to encourage discussion, so people can read different opinions to get different ideas and perspectives on how people view these brands.

Link to album: http://imgur.com/a/qRWVZ

1. Dial/Bezel:
Simple, understated and gorgeous, in a nutshell. The dial was what ultimately sold me on the  watch. I love the soft horizontal stripes on the dial. Imo, this looks classier than the big bold vertical stripes on the previous aquaracer model. I also like the sweeping arrow second hand and the simple hour markers. The date window is conservative and easy to read, without a cyclops. It has good lume, enough to be able to tell time accurately in darkness.
The ceramic bezel is one of the easiest I've operated on a diver and yet very firm. the clicks are audible and I counted 120 clicks in one rotation. The surfaces are quite smooth and will not get caught in a jacket/shirt easily. There is absolutely no play when adjusting it. I can get it to align to the 12 hour marker perfectly. I'm OCD about it and I hate it when the bezel does not align proplerly, so this definitely gets my approval. I like the fact that its ceramic, so it will not get scratched easily.


2. Case/Caseback/Bracelet:
The case itself is solid steel and well built. It's heavy and has good wrist presence. The watch does wear slightly larger than a normal 41mm watch. 
It does not have a display caseback, but instead has a normal caseback with the diver helmet logo.
The bracelet looks like its 316L stainless steel. It's well built and quite heavy. The clasp is a fold-over with a button release. At this price point, I would like to see a safety in there as well. I found the links in the bracelet to be too large for my hands.I was not able to get it to match my wrist size perfectly after removing links, so I will probably replace it with a nice leather band.


2. Movement:
From what I can gather, Tag uses either ETA2824 or SW200 movements for what they call Caliber 5. It's likely that my watch has a SW200 movement, which is very similar to the ETA2824 movement running at 28,800 bph. It's a fairly standard movement, so I haven't spent much time on figuring it out. I got +4 secs and +3 secs in the 2 days I've had it.

Overall:

At the ~$1600 price point, I think this is a very well built watch. It doesn't boast the best movement for the $$ price, but in this case, the design and the build quality won me over. Only time will tell how well it functions, but right now, I think I've added a good piece to my collection.",,False,,t5_2qls5,1364354297.0,,,True,t3_1b37dn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1b37dn/tag_heuer_aquaracer_500m_ceramic/,

He then told us that that same wind going back would give is a huge boost and according to his computer made the journey only four hours and twenty minutes. Faster than he's ever made the trip.

They have done project watches before, but this one would be made specifically with a Seagull ST25 automatic movement, and will be built in China.

Being a native born Chinese, I jumped in and registered for the watch, which had a limited run of just 150 pieces, and continued to play a role in its development and final design as a moonphase. 

I'm happy to say that I got the [watch](http://i.imgur.com/s7a12h.jpg) yesterday, complete with my [Chinese name engraved](http://i.imgur.com/suee3.jpg) on the back and a serial number of 137/150. It's a Seagull ST25 with date and moonphase complications, and I think it's a good business casual watch. The final cost was less than $150, so it was very affordable, although I'm more impressed with its rarity and the fact that it's sapphire crystal on both sides for that amount of money.

So far, it is running about +9s/day, which is very acceptable to me.

This is part seven in our ongoing community project to compile opinions on the many watch brands out there into a single list. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/jnzih/introducing_the_rwatches_brand_guide/) is the original post explaining the project.

You good people asked for more higher-end brands last week, so here we go. The antithesis of [Nixon](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/kudbv/brand_guide_nixon/), this week's brand is the one and only [Patek Philippe](http://www.patek.com/). They really need no introduction, but I like to hear myself talk, so you're going to get one anyway:

Widely renowned as the finest watch manufacturer in the world, Patek Philippe has been in business continuously since 1851. Based in Geneva, Patek has watched its competitors be slowly bought up by large fashion houses like Swatch and Richemont, leaving them the last truly independent major brand at the top of the horological world. Though they do offer two collections of [sport watches](http://www.patek.com/html/en/discover_men_nautilus.html), Patek's bread and butter is their sleek, elegant, classic dress watches. Although their prices are astronomical (with their cheapest watches costing well over $10,000 new), the reputation and enduring quality of their watches make it worth it (though still quite unobtainable) to many watch enthusiasts, who widely consider Patek to be the very best of the best. These are the watches that one might save up his entire life to buy in order to pass down to future generations.

Although I don't expect that many in the /r/Watches community have had the pleasure of owning a Patek, anything and everything, from experience to opinion, is welcome in this thread.

If you're going to downvote someone, please don't do so without posting the reason why you disagree with them. The purpose of these discussion threads is to encourage discussion, so people can read different opinions to get different ideas and perspectives on how people view these brands.

 My grandpa passed away a few months ago and we found this in with his things, it was fairly beat up and I wasn't sure what to do, so I went to r/watches!
 Read through several posts and decided to take it in to a local watch shop to have it cleaned up and serviced. After about a month wait, I got the watch back and it is awesome. Here are some pictures (for reference, I have a 7in wrist):

http://imgur.com/a/xycOf

The watch was given to my GG as a 25 year award according to the inscription on the back. He worked at a steel company in Pennsylvania. I'm not sure if the watch is from exactly 1958, but that is when the award was given. I'm also not exactly sure what model this is, I forgot to ask the watch shop if there were any markings inside the case, but it says Hamilton on the face and on the back, as well as J14k on the back. 
 Anyway, I love the way the watch looks (even if it is a bit small for current styling) and thought some other watch enthusiasts might enjoy seeing it as well. 
 Also, on the suggestion of someone here, I decided to go with a genuine lizard band, instead of simply lizard grain. Enjoy!

Here is my build I just completed.,nebulight,69,13,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/vgqni/so_you_like_pocket_watch_conversions_here_is_my/,"So I've always been a fan of the vintage IWC portuguese; specifically the dials with the off white color and gold indices. Watches like these are way out of my price range. I frequent various watch forums and came across a sales thread for an old Henex pocket watch. The seller was showing off the movement more than anything else. It was a [nice brass/bronze type finish](http://i.imgur.com/eu8fc.jpg) however I was more interested in the [dial and hands](http://i.imgur.com/TvZyI.jpg). However since this was a 6497 and the seconds hand was at 6, I couldn't use the movement in a watch case and have the dial correctly placed. So I had to source another movement (6498). As many on here know, there are various types of 6498 movements. Since this is a mini-grail project, I decided to go all out and get a [6498-2](http://i.imgur.com/R1BmI.jpg) from Tourby. I has the nice GDG strips, real blued screws, 21,600 BPH, Incabloc shock system, Glucydur balance and longer 50+ hour power reserve.

I wanted to document with good photos, but I didn't have good light. However I couldn't wait so I started as the movement came today.

Well, as it turns out, the plexi was too large. I had a few spares, but nothing that fit. I ended up putting the sapphire back in for now, but have a few more plexis on order. Now on to the movement:

The album does not do this watch justice.  The watch has a sturdy, solid feel to it.  The black dial changes to a dark navy, depending on the light creating a really nice effect.  It's not dark enough to see the tritium tubes yet.  There is a great  level of visual detail in this watch that does not make it seem cluttered.

I considered a Hamilton Jazzmaster or the Ball Trainmaster Eternity before I decided on this one.  I was searching for something a little bit more unique than a Hamilton and more versatile than the Ball Eternity.  As an aside, the Eternity is a beautiful watch that I hope to one day own.

1369672699.0,54,self.Watches,1f578p,[Ball Trainmaster 60 Seconds] Some initial impressions and photos (plus a small bonus at the end!),spedmonkey,64,10,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1f578p/ball_trainmaster_60_seconds_some_initial/,"Like so many others, I quite recently finished college, and my parents, like so many others, wanted to commemorate the occasion by getting me a nice watch. They originally got me a [TAG Heuer Formula 1 Grande Date](http://us.tagheuer.com/en/home#/en-luxury-watches-formula-1-grande-date42mm-black-steel-bracelet-wau1112-ba0858) from Tourneau, which was very nice, albeit quartz. My parents said repeatedly that I ought to take it back and exchange it if I didn't like it, but I intended to keep it. I had to get some links taken out of the bracelet, though, so I took it back to the store, intending to just look around some while they sized it for me.

As I browsed, my very patient fiancee in tow, I noticed a few Ball models in the pre-owned section. One in particular jumped out at me, and it fell perfectly into my price range, with a bit left over. I couldn't not make the switch, and the Tourneau people were very accommodating about making the exchange, despite the fact that I didn't have an original receipt. **tl;dr - Got TAG, saw Ball, couldn't resist, exchanged them.**

Anyway, here's the specs:

41mm (without crown)  
ETA 2836-2  
Sapphire crystal, front and back  
50M Water resist  
Screw-in crown  
Tritium hour markers and hour, minute, and second hands

Please excuse my terrible photography; all I have is a point-and-shoot and no artistic skill whatsoever.

So, onto some thoughts. First, the movement is a pretty basic, unadorned [ETA 2836-2](http://i.imgur.com/DPaj0kJ.jpg), which as I understand it is basically the venerable 2824-2 with a day module added on. I essentially paid $1300 for this, which is on the high side of reasonable, I think; list price is $1999, which is pretty steep. I don't think I would have purchased this new. That said, it's been keeping fantastic time in the two days since I obtained the watch, at an average rate of ~+6 sec/day, and I am looking forward to the ease of servicing down the line.

The [strap](http://i.imgur.com/iWMN2cy.jpg), stamped with the brand name, is not amazing, but it's certainly OK. It's calf leather, and it's quite thick and soft. Naturally, the [buckle](http://i.imgur.com/jcYMBxh.jpg) is signed as well. I think I'm going to look into getting both some other straps (dark brown croc leather?) and an OEM bracelet down the line to mix things up some, though my wallet is cringing at the $300+ hit it's going to take from both of those. The current strap is more than sufficient for now, though, I think.

My wrists are approximately 7 inches, and at 41mm, it fits [my wrist](http://i.imgur.com/5cgLm0G.jpg) pretty well. Though the lugs hang over a little bit in that picture for some reason, it doesn't really do so in person. I'm really into the aesthetics of the face. The white enamel dial is wonderful, and the ornate painted-on numerals are pretty neat. It makes for, in my opinion, a bit of a throwback style, which I like. The blued steel hands are just beautiful, and my [photos of the face](http://i.imgur.com/kEdfDsK.jpg) really don't do them justice. They change from a dark blue to a brighter, lighter shade depending on the light. [This guy's pictures](http://forums.watchuseek.com/f239/ball-trainmaster-60-seconds-ii-676473.html) capture it a little bit better, but there's still no substitute for seeing them in person.

Continuing on with the dial aesthetics, I really enjoy the little details Ball put into it, which [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/KfzyB3o.jpg) kinda captures. The Ball RR logo on the seconds hand is a bit over-the-top to some, but I think it fits in with the overall feel of the watch. I'm still not sure how I feel about the '7' numeral, which is actually text reading ""Ball &amp; C"". It's a bit tacky, but at the same time, as I said, I like little details like that. Get back to me on this in a few weeks or a month or so. Also, the individually-labeled seconds and 24 hours could be a bit on the busy side, but I think they complement the overall feel of the dial as well. I'm sure not everyone will feel the same, but so it goes.

Lastly, I should touch on the tritium lume. Unfortunately, due to my combination of shitty camera and shitty photography, I couldn't capture a good picture of it, so I hope words will suffice. It's not as bright as Superluminova, at least not initially upon being put into the dark, but its sustain is much better - several hours later, it's still pretty bright and visible, whereas standard lume is often pretty faded by then. I've always wanted a tritium watch, and now that I finally own one, I'm definitely a fan.

So, final impressions? I really like it (as if you expected anything else). I don't know that I would pay list price for it, but at a decent pre-owned price, I think it's pretty reasonable. It's not really a dress watch, but more of a casual-dress one, if that makes sense - the type of thing I'd feel comfortable wearing to a desk job regularly, but not to anything fancy, really. Whatever. I'm gonna wear the thing everywhere for the foreseeable future. Fuck tha police.

Here's the full album of photos: http://imgur.com/a/iohQ9. For more (probably better) photos, I'd suggest taking a look at [this WUS thread](http://forums.watchuseek.com/f239/topper-time-prize-ball-trainmaster-sixty-seconds-ii-arrived-786420.html).

Now for the promised small bonus: I mentioned earlier that there was some credit left over from the exchange of the TAG. We put that toward a new watch for my fiancee: a Luminox 7065 Colormark in pink. At 39mm it's pretty big on her wrists, but she likes the contrast between masculine and feminine, as well as how it's pretty indestructible, as she tends to be accident prone. Here's a couple photos: [Caseback](http://i.imgur.com/rHm8uyS.jpg), [Wrist shot](http://i.imgur.com/ZEXbdMP.jpg).

However, it seems that wearing a time piece is starting to feel more and more like a generational thing.  The younger generations the gen Zs and  younger typically don't seem to wear a watch.  Myself as a gen Xer I can't imagine not wearing a watch, as it is the primary way I tell time.  Its just quicker to look at my watch vs. pull out my phone unlock it and get the time.  

Also, I've come to notice that it seems some particular professions seem to wear watches.  I dont want to say what my hypothesis is, but I'd love to hear.
