I have, as of the time of posting, been awake for over 26 hours.

I did some research, and I found that the guy that called me a 'shemale' was the owner, president and CEO of his security company, that hasn't been actually in business for more than about 4 months. So basically, its ""I'm the King of Everything"" syndrome, so he doesn't seem to believe he has anyone to answer to.

So, as of the morning, I had waited for an answer from my boss, and relayed every bit of information I could find of who he is, what his company has done, and anything else I could find. At about 1 PM, I get a call from my boss explaining that he talked to the manager that had actually requested the extra security, and the woman that apparently hired them, who was an off-site, out of state dispatch contractor.

My boss explained my side of the story, and his side of the story, and emphasized that what he did was pure, unabashed harassment. They were shocked, and promptly shredded the contract with AAA, and barred them from future service with the corporation.

Then, my boss gave me the address for filing a formal complaint, and said he would give me his full support and back up my story with the DCS, and his supervisors and our corporate managers had my back as well.

I am loved, it seems. X3

Anyway, I found that the offending company, AAA, *just* officially opened their doors on Monday. So they're **really** off to a great start.

Thoughts, comments, anything?

I don't know what I am.,Genderless_,145,25,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1ihowp/my_mother_stole_my_identity_i_dont_know_what_i_am/,"My friends and girlfriend always bug me for never talking about my fucked up past. I've never told anyone this. I hope you guys can help me.

This is my last chance at living a normal life. 

My mom always wanted a girl... and she was 100% sure she was pregnant with one. She had bought baby girl clothes, painted my room a light pink color and already had names picked out.

I wasn't born female and... My mother didn't like that. 

She quit her job as successful architect and moved us from Asheburn Chicago to  an upper class neighborhood in New York. (I have requested I do not learn the exact location for emotional reasons.) Started a new life and cut contact off with pretty much almost everyone when she found out I was going to be born male. She snapped and decided to raise me as a girl anyways; like she always wanted. She refused to believe I was male.

I was Rebecca. 

I guess you could say I grew up a typical little girl. I was enjoying life, I had long hair and took interest in mostly female type activities like dolls and dress up, nothing seemed wrong at all. I was told by my mother and always figured the equipment between my legs would just fall off or something during puberty, like all normal girls. 

When I was of age, I was enrolled in an all girls private school in kindergarten and life was pretty great. I had many friends and would have many play dates with them at my house. Looking back at it now it chills me to know how calm and natural my mom was when meeting the parents of other girls, like nothing was different with me. 

That life lasted until the ending of grade 3. I remember that day like no other. We would have long assemblies every 1st Friday of the month about school activities, fund raisers, sports meetings, etc. And I really had to go pee, and I guess I couldn't hold it; a teacher quickly noticed my accident. She and another teacher brought me to the change room to get me a new skirt and I guess that's when they noticed I was not a female. 

At first, I had no idea what was going on. Child protective services and the police showed up at the school and before I knew it I was being driven away... I didn't see my mother for a couple days after that. They cut off all my hair and I was sent to live with my grandmother. 

What really got me was the hair. I loved long hair, I screamed as they cut it and I swear a piece of my childhood died that day.

Later growing up I was explained all the details of the story and it all was really confusing. I didn't like being a boy, I was a girl! I thought I was a girl for 7 and a half years of my life. I felt disconnected with myself for what felt like a life time. I was told time and time again to not grow out my hair, don't play with dolls, ""you're NOT a girl."" 

I'm 19 now. I'm not thrilled with my life but I'm enjoying it somewhat now more then I was a couple years ago. I'm not the most masculine guy but that's okay. I talk to my mom every once in a while but I don't like too. It brings back to many memories. I've maybe spoken to her a handful of times since the event. She still lives in New York, works there. My father died from a heart attack while my mother was pregnant so I've never met him but I've heard he was a really cool, caring, awesome man. 

I've recently been having very dysphoric feelings about being male but I don't know if its because of my past or me missing my mom or that I'm trans or all of the above. I don't mind being a guy now, but I really do miss being a girl. It just felt more *right*.

If you read this...Thank you, I've never told anyone and it kinda feels good to get it off my chest.

**TL;DR:**My insane mother raised me as a girl for 7 years until the police and child services got involved. who am I?

***EDIT***: I've heard of a couple other documented cases like this so I don't have a lot to relate too, plus I heard most of them didn't end up transitioning.

Tricky business, this.

But she agreed to come with me because our time was limited.

At the restaurant, she relaxed after a few welcoming smiles from the staff. She asked, ""Am I passable?""

(long pause)

I replied, ""I know what you want me to say, and I know what you want other people to say too. But here's the truth: I can tell you are biologically male. You would need some facial surgery to obscure that fact more easily without makeup because your bone structure/nose profile is somewhat more masculine than average.""

""However, and this is a BIG however, you do look like a *very interesting person* and a cute one at that. Someone I would like to get to know better if I didn't already know you. HRT has softened your features. Your painted nails look impeccable. Your long hair is quite pretty. I'd have guessed you were some sort of androgynous model or artist or creative type of person. Definitely a FAR cry from your average dude. Actually, you don't look like a ""dude"" at all. Dudeness is oblivious, deliberately male, and has an attitude. You don't have any of that. You are interesting and different and obviously making the best of your life in new and creative ways. That makes you a person I give a shit about.""

She smiled, and we enjoyed our meal. No more trans-discussions. We talked about fun things and future projects. Life continued onward. The end.

I'm not saying passing doesn't matter. Of course it does. But passing is grounded in our common superficiality. It only goes so far. It's easy to see how the most attractive and passable girls get the majority of upvotes and attention. But so what? It's the same for girls who menstruate. At some point, you have to open your mouth and talk. You have to demonstrate what you are made of. 

Epilogue: My friend decided to have an enjoyable lunch with me rather than stay home and hide. She knows who she is, she knows she will be perceived as male sometimes, and she doesn't let that stop her from living her life.

bout 5 months ago i met my boyfriend online. he was living about 100 miles away from me in northern louisiana. hes totally straight, like straight as they come cowboy boots and fishing southern guy. after taking me on a few dates his family wondered why he was so happy. he showed them pictures of me and they were proud of him for scoring a ""beautiful woman"" as they called me. i even got to meet his mom and had lunch with her. we talked and she hugged me. things seemed to be going well.

his mom ""figured me out"" and flipped the script. his whole family are pentacostal christians (ya know, the speaking in tongues type) and once they heard about me they all turned on him. one second they were praising him for finding a girl that wasn't going to use him and actually cared about him, and the next they demonize him. they'd called him faggot, unclean homosexual, being a ""man's bitch"", and other horrible things. this didn't just come from his family, but his extended family, his friends, and even his community. nearly everyone he knows has betrayed him in some way. his grandfather even pulled a shotgun on him and demanded he get off his property when he was trying to visit his niece and nephew. they've tried to take his car away and send him to a straight doctor. i don't know how that would end up working since he loves tits and ass and long hair and legs.

his family is very wealthy. they're like the joneses. they own a lot of businesses in their little town and a lot of people work for them. they have their hands in the pockets of law enforcement and politicians. they pretty much control the entire town and if they don't like you, you can easily disappear without a trace. he had his own house and his own land up there. all his belongings and even money that he had stashed away are up there. hes afraid that should someone see him, that something bad will happen to him. the people there knows who he is and what he looks like and even his car. if he tried to go back to his house to get a few things he could very well end up shot, or worse.

and all of this is because he chose to be with the woman he loves. [all of this because he loves me](http://i.imgur.com/xJLPV0F.jpg). they hate him because they think hes a flaming fag when hes anything but that. hes a sweet and strong man who takes care of the people he cares about. now we're trying to figure out what to do. we can't go to the law enforcement because they're just gonna side with his family.

so what do we do? we're broke and he needs to get his money and his things. he has a lot of valuable stuff up there, but i don't want him to go up there and then never come back or never be heard from again. this is quite possibly the most bizarre thing that i've ever been involved with in my whole life. i can't think of anything else but to tell his story and hear any and all suggestions. i wish there was a subreddit for people in danger or something.

This thread will be a diary thread periodically updated every so often with new entries. This will document my experience with SRS in Bangkok, Thailand. All posts, unless otherwise noted, are in local Bangkok time. The two people going on this trip are myself and my boyfriend. I'm scheduled for SRS, him for top surgery.

6/11/2013, 4:00 AM: Woke up this morning to the first morning in Bangkok. We left Houston at 4 PM local Houston time on Saturday, and made it to Bangkok at 4 PM local time on Monday. There's a twelve hour time difference in there, but still quite a trip.

The trip almost died before it even began. We arrived at Houston IAH airport around 12:30, 3.5 hours before the flight. I had tried to print off boarding passes the previous night, but it gave me some sort of error. We went to the counter to get our tickets, but they said they couldn't find them. We went to another counter, and the rude lady looked it up.

She told us that our tickets had somehow been cancelled. We got the tickets back in April. Originally there was some trouble with my credit card, but we were able to straighten it out then. Lufthansa successfully charged my card and the charge is still on there.

Well, when we got to the airport, the Lufthansa people were inexplicably claiming our tickets were cancelled. The lady at the counter refused to look much into it, and told us to just call the customer service number.

I did, waited through an enormous hold time of a half hour before talking to a human. The person on the line gave an impossible story. They said that my credit card company had disputed the charges and that Lufthansa had issued a refund for the tickets.

This was impossible as no refund ever showed up on my account. Additionally, a credit card company cannot simply issue a dispute, only the actual cardholder can. The rep on the phone could not give me any reason why they would cancel tickets without informing me, they just told me to call my credit card company. 

I think what really happened was there was a mixup with their system and they were trying to pass the buck. They offered to let us purchase two completely new tickets at the current rate, $4500 per ticket! That was completely impossible. No way to afford that. They said they simply didn't have the ability to offer the tickets at the original rate (total lie.) When I asked for a supervisor, the supervisor said the same thing. When I asked for her supervisor, she gave some BS line about their being no higher supervisor (again impossible.)

Anyway, so it was now an hour and a half before the plane is scheduled to leave. I've lost all hope at this point. A friend of ours, however, hasn't. He and his wife had given us a ride to the airport. When they heard we were having trouble, they came back to the airport and started helping us out. I have no idea how the hell he did it, but he was able to resolve the issue. He got on the line, immediately went through several levels of ""let me talk to your supervisor"", threatening to go to the media, and was somehow able to get it straightened out. I still can't figure out exactly what they changed. 

They told him that they would charge my card at the original rate, but no such charge has shown up on my card. I think they might have just realized their error and issued tickets to correct it, but I still haven't figured it out yet. Anyway, somehow we were able to get our tickets. We got through security and got on our flight.

The trip was two 10-11 hour flights. One was between Houston and Frankfurt, the other between Frankfurt and Bangkok. Tried to get what sleep we could, though very little was possible on the plane. We spent most of our Frankfurt layover snoozing on the seats in the gate. Sleeping mask and earphones, sleeping the day away at noon local time.  The flight to Bangkok went a little better as the seat next to us was empty and we had some extra room. Still, we arrived in Bangkok dead tired. Hadn't slept for more than an hour or two at a time for the entire trip.

We arrived at 4 PM or so. Got picked up by the driver without any problem. Arrived at the hotel, registered, and got settled in. Room is nothing fancy, just your basic hotel room, but it will do. Went to bed early and woke up early. Still trying to get adjusted to the local time zone. We have our first consultation with Dr. Chettawut scheduled later today.

6/12/2013 1 PM: We started the day yesterday with breakfast at the hotel. We really pigged out, me especially, as it was the last day of regular meals for me. All sorts of nice breakfast food. At 10 AM, we left for the consult with Chet.

We met Chettawut for the first time. Everything seems fine. He did an exam for me for SRS and for my bf for top surgery. I might end up needing a groin skin graft, so he asked permission to do that. If he needs to, it's an extra $1000. :/ Oh well, do it once, do it right. He and his staff are very nice, very professional. We filled out misc paperwork, had our consultation, etc. 

In the afternoon, we went to a local hospital to get some miscellaneous medical testing done. We could have done this in the US, but it's far cheaper over here. We had blood drawn for various blood tests, including HIV screening. Chest X-Ray to test for tuberculosis. We also each had a quick psych consult as required by Thai law for SRS. We got a clean bill of health and went back to the hotel.

We had planned to do some more stuff last night, but around 5 PM or so we got back and just laid on the bed for awhile. We had been up since 2 AM, still adjusting to the time zone switch. I just rested my eyes a bit, and woke up around 2 AM the next morning. T_T I took a sleeping pill, got some extra sleep, and woke up around 8 AM. Hopefully we're back on schedule now. 

We had breakfast, well in theory anyway. Aiden had breakfast, I had ""breakfast."" I'm now on an all-liquid diet for the next three days. So breakfast was a bowl of soup broth and five glasses of various juice. T_T My surgery date is on Saturday. His is Friday. 

Today we went to the mall across the street. We exchanged a few hundred dollars for baht and did some shopping for a few basic things at Tesco. From the quick look around the stores, electronics are the same or perhaps a little more expensive than the US, but clothes are way, way cheaper.

6/12/2013 4 PM: All liquid diets officially suck. You can get a fair amount of calories and nutrients from juices, broths, and such, but it doesn't help with the hunger. :/ 

6/13/2013 6 PM: Second day of all-liquid diet. Went to the store again, stocked up on a bunch of munchables for when we're both stuck in the hotel room recovering. You know how hard it is to walk past dozens of stalls and shops selling tasty, dirt cheap food and not be able to eat a bit of it? I do. :/ Today I subsisted off juice, soda, and water. The closest thing I had to food was the miso soup at the breakfast buffet. Had five bowls of it! At least that helped keep the edge off the hunger, unlike yesterday. Tomorrow Aiden goes in for his top surgery and I do the worst part of the whole bowel cleansing stuff - I get to take Swiff, the human draino. :/

6/14/2013 1:15 PM: Crazy day. Got up and had breakfast, a few bowls of miso soup broth. Took the awful Swiff stuff, diluted it like 15x in sprite and drank the first dose at 9 AM. Will have the second dose at 5 PM. Basically hung out in the bathroom all morning. Did laundry. The hotel has a laundry service, but it's really expensive, like $2 to wash a pair of underwear. Just washed everything with hand soap and hung it up to dry. So hung out in the bathroom, alternating between washing clothes and jumping on the toilet. :/

But that's nothing compared to what just happened. I just went down to the lobby to see Aiden off. Can't come with him to the surgery center, I'm stuck here dealing with my own pre-surgery stuff. Lots of hugs, goodbyes. Didn't really start crying until I got to the room. Now I'm alone in the room, 10x more worried about him than how my surgery will go. I requested that they give me a call when he gets out of surgery safe, and I'm going to refuse to go into surgery tomorrow until I can see him and make sure everything is ok. Damn I love that guy. If anything happened to him...God. SRS is canceled at the very least. I know I worry too much. But damn, ya know? Our two year anniversary is Monday, June 17th. ;_;

6/14/2013 7:40 PM: Got the phone call. Aiden made it out of surgery fine. He's in recovery now. Meanwhile, I'm back at the hotel room dealing with major major runs from the stupid SWIFF (human draino) crap. ;/

6/15/2013 11:30 AM: Aiden got back. He was in pretty bad shape at first, but he seems to be rapidly improving as the drugs flush out of his system. First thought I wouldn't be able to leave him. Now looks like he'll be fine. I leave for surgery at 1 PM.

6/16/2013 12:30 PM: Survived surgery. Brain in fog. In and out of sleep. Typing is hard. Catheters royally suck.

6/17/2013 5:45 AM: Made it through second night in hospital. Was just in and out of sleep all day yesterday. Yesterday had the fluid IV removed. Still in the recovery room, will move to a regular hospital room later today. Slowly getting my strength back. Able to stay awake for longer and longer periods of time. No pain to speak of except some discomfort from the stupid catheter. Still on an all-liquid diet.

I've been sitting in the hospital bed for the last 36 hours. Legs spread apart as to not put pressure on the groin area. On my legs there are these things that are difficult to describe. They're large mechanical pressure garments. One leg tightens, then the other leg tightens. They go back and forth. It's like those pressure cuffs you use to take a blood pressure reading, but over the whole leg.

6/17/2013 1 PM: Got moved from the recovery room to a regular hospital room. Much quieter. No big leg cuffs on. Will stay here for another two days. It's Aiden and I's two year anniversary today. &lt;3

6/18/2013 10:15 AM: Sleep cycle is all kinds of mixed up. Went to bed at 5 PM last night. Woke up at 10 PM. Surfed a bit, slept again from midnight til 4 AM or so. I get out of the hospital tomorrow. Get the vaginal packing removed Saturday. Should get the evil catheter out on Monday. Right now I'm just passing the time away, trying to be as still as possible, not move my legs too much. Did a [casual IMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/1gjne7/im_currently_laying_in_a_hospital_bed_in_bangkok/) to help pass the time. Sent some emails to my coworkers this morning, let 'em know I survived surgery. Passing the time on reddit and watching various movies at TV shows. Currently watching the Fifth Element. :P

6/18/2013 2:15 PM: Feeling better today. Had enough energy that I filled out a credit card dispute form. I looked into the situation, and it seems it's all Lufthansa's fault. No one at my credit card ever called to dispute the original tickets purchased in April. Lufthansa did however charge for the tickets a second time, on the day of the flight in June. So I filed an actual dispute to the original charges. My account currently shows the same tickets charged twice. 

6/18/2013 6:40 PM Had some solid food for the first time in a week today. Just creamy soup and some crackers. Digestive system is starting up again, and getting lots of random gas. :/ FML Tomorrow I'll get the tube drains and the epidural taken out. The catheter and packing will stay in for a few more days. Will go back to the hotel and pretty much just hang out there, but at least Aiden and I will be able to keep each other company. :)

6/19/2013 10:15 AM: Got out of the hospital. Got the epidural taken out, got some tube drains removed (OW!). Still have the catheter in. They took a lot of the bindings off the bottom. Got a first look at the results. Looks good, but really, really swollen. Will be able to take my first shower on Friday. Got taken back to the hotel. Got a big bag with medication to take, various supplies, and this big pink donut butt pillow to sit on. Still a bit groggy from the meds. 

6/19/2013 5 PM: First real meal in a week. Nothing but cream soup and crackers at the hospital. Mmmmm pasta. :D

6/20/2013: 1:15 We find Chettawut's aftercare to be severely deficient. They have two nurses that travel around on a part-time basis to multiple patients. i don't know how many patients he has at a time, but this is far, far too low to provide any level of basic nursing care. Aftercare seems to be essentially non-existent. I do not recommend coming here unless you have someone there to take care of you in the time after surgery.

Originally I wanted to do Aiden and I's surgeries one week apart. I would do my SRS one week before his top surgery. He would be able to help me out during my first critical week of healing, and I could provide assistance after that. This was the original plan. 

Chettawut however insisted on changing this. For whatever strange reason, he wanted to do our two surgeries back-to-back. He assured us this would not be a problem. 

Well it turns out it is. His aftercare is a joke. A nurse comes by once per day for a cursory five minute visit. From discussing with Aiden here, it seems he was basically dumped in the hotel after surgery. I was extremely anxious to go into surgery after seeing what state he was in, but they assured me he would get plenty of care from the nurses.

He was in bad shape after surgery. He spent several days alone, struggling to breath, unable to eat. Luckily he only ever had to urinate, not deficate, while I was away, as he is unable to go clean up without assistance. While in the hospital, I repeatedly pleaded with them to make sure he was okay, and they simply said it was ok. 

It seems Dr. Chettawut or his  staff have a severe misunderstanding of the severity of FTM top surgery. They don't seem to get the concept that you essentially lose the use of your arms for two weeks after surgery. They say disturbing things like, ""don't worry. don't worry. It's a minor surgery."" 

I am back in the hotel room now and have to offer what aid I can to him. However, I have to worry about my own aftercare, and am really worried about moving too much and damaging the skin graft that is still healing. I had to help him clean up after using the restroom earlier today. 

When the nurses came, they offered only the most minimal level of care possible. They took a quick look at Aiden's tube drains and inspected how my surgical site is healing. We could use some basic nursing care, but they don't provide it. I asked them to help Aiden wash up. He needs a simple sponge bath, just a wipe down with a washcloth from the sink. I was washed in such a manner while I was in the hospital, but Aiden has been alone and has not received such care. I told them that he needs washing, but they refused. They said they did not have time and that he could do it himself. They said his surgery was minor and that he's fully capable of helping himself. They're completely ignorant about the FTM top surgery recovery process. They also can't seem to grasp the concept that my boyfriend is a ""he"" not a ""she."" Constant misgendering. 

I think we'll be able to get through this, but I really have to caution people. Do NOT come to a doctor like this unless you have someone to take care of you after surgery. You WILL be essentially alone after surgery and will receive very little basic nursing aftercare. You are one your own.

6/21/2013 9:30 AM: Might have overreacted yesterday, was in a pretty emotional state. I guess I'm really not in too bad a shape, it's really Aiden who's been neglected the most. I can take some hardship myself, but when something happens to him, I really start to freak out.

We have improved one thing that really helps. We let the staff at the hotel staff know that they can simply knock on the door and come on in when we say ""come on in!"" It sounds ridiculous, just walking to the door being such a big deal, but it actually is. The goal is to just sit in bed and move as little as possible. I've moved some stuff near the bed so I don't have to get up as often, and this seems to have helped. I just hope everything heals up well, the skin grafts take alright, and nothing is damaged.

As an aside, I've been watching way to much *The Walking Dead* lately. I've been going through the series, just episode after episode. This is fine, except that last night and the night before, I've had dreams involving zombies. :/ Last night was really weird, like the actual SRS trip merged with the zombie thoughts. For some reason I was worrying, ""how the hell are we going to get back to Houston? Won't the Bangkok, Frankfurt, and Houston airports be overrun with zombies? Should I even bother going home, my house is in a very poor position to defend against a hoard of zombies. Wouldn't surprise me if Houston is completely overrun. Are the airlines even operating flights anymore???"" :D

6/21/2013 2:00 PM: The nurses came again today. Aiden's tube drains were removed, getting rid of the biggest source of pain for him. They took the vaginal packing out. That was strange. It was like one of those magicians with the scarves in their sleeve. Just seemed to never end. They input a stent and found the initial depth - a full 6"", 7"" to the edge of the outer labia. Things are healing up quite well. No tears, no graft failures, and the swelling has gone down a lot. It actually looks like, well, any other vagina. Spectacular results I think. :) 

Tomorrow the nurse will return and show me how to do the first dilation. That is going to hurt. Not looking forward to that. The catheter is still in, and it will turn out on Monday.

6/22/2013 3 PM: Things are going well. Still confined to the hotel room until the 26th. After that I'll be able to wander about the hotel. Settled into a routine. Breakfast in the morning, through the middle of the day just have some snacks of various sorts, then have dinner at night from the room service menu. 

Today a nurse came and I had my first dilation. Went very well. The key is just to relax, focus on a TV show or some other distraction, stay calm and let it happen. Still wearing pads and blood still shows up on them. Small amounts of blood came out when I removed the stent. The sutures are healing well, but I still just need to move slowly, not bend my legs much, and not stress the wound. Won't be doing yoga for awhile. :D

Oh, also finished watching through season three of The Walking Dead today. Need to find something else to watch now...

6/23/2013 high noon: just finished watching Forrest Gump. So many waterworks. Damn movie. I can watch episode after episode of a zombie series, watch someone's face get gnawed, and feel nothing in particular. I watch Forrest Gump once, and I'm crying left and right. The feels. ;_;

Need to do two dilations today. Will be my first attempt to dilate by myself. We'll see how it goes. 

6/24/2013 1:45 PM: Finally got that horrible catheter out today! Took a big dose of pain medicine this morning, and the nurse got it out without any difficulty. Still won't be dancing or jogging around any time soon, but damn it feels good to get that out.

Had my first urination. Didn't burn and didn't have to force it, but it was definitely...interesting. It was not any kind of stream, it was just a huge dribbling stream that went everywhere. Bleh. Oh well, will get better with time. About to take my first shower in nine days. T_T Other than that, just chilling in the room, eagerly awaiting the results from the Supreme Court.

6/25/2013 12:15 AM: damn. No decision on the big cases. Better luck tomorrow. Moved from the number one to the number two dilator, and wow. T_T After two dilation sessions using the bigger one, I'm definitely feeling rather...stretched out. T_T

6/25/2013 7:50: woke up too late this morning. Need to set an alarm. Woke up at 11 AM, too late to order breakfast to the room. :/ Had to order lunch and dinner from room service. To save cost, we've just been having a big breakfast, which is included in the room, munching on some snacks during the day, then ordering dinner at night. 

Had dilation this morning. Used the number 2 dilator again. Then the nurse came, and I got a stern talking to. Apparently I wasn't supposed to move up to the larger dilator yet, could cause damage. So I've moved back to number one for now. 

Oh, sent a note to ameliabee. Would be good to post it here for record. This is at the Dusit Princess Srinakarin hotel:

&gt;Oh, one thing I need to tell you. LAUNDRY

&gt;There is a laundry service available at the hotel, but it's absurdly, stupidly expensive. I have no idea why it costs so damn much, but it's so expensive as to be unusable. They charge per item, and it's like $6-7 to wash a pair of jeans, $2-3 to wash a pair of underwear, $4-5 to wash a t-shirt. It's fucking ridiculous.

&gt;So, plan accordingly. Luckily I brought a ton of underwear, that's the only thing that really gets dirty. Since most of the trip I'm just hanging out at the hotel, my clothes really don't get that dirty, so I'm just wearing bottoms and tops 2-3 times. Even cleaned some laundry by washing by hand the day before I left for surgery.

&gt;So seriously, plan accordingly. Either bring enough stuff that you won't have to do laundry, or bring things that can easily be washed by hand. Don't plan on paying for laundry. I bet it would literally be cheaper to walk across the street to the mall, by underwear, wear it once, then throw it in the garbage than it is to pay for cleaning underwear here.

6/26/2013 2:30 PM: Just another day here, waiting for the big Supreme Court decision at 9 PM local time. Everything's healing well. Dilation going well. Today is the last day I'm confined to the hotel room. After today I can wander about the hotel. Watching through Breaking Bad. At season 3 episode 9 now. Missing American food. Would kill for some Pollos Hermanos right now.

6/28/2013 5:30 PM: Some interesting times. As of yesterday, we're free to wander about the hotel. Can go eat at the restaurants, visit other rooms, etc. In the last few days we met and have been hanging out with Amelia, u/ameliabee. She's awesome. :) She has surgery tomorrow, and we've commiserated a bit as she's been surviving the Swiff stuff today. :( Best of luck Amelia!

The only exciting thing today was the plumbing leak. This morning, was using the restroom. Didn't use it, didn't touch it, but when I flushed the toilet the metal hose for the bidet sprayer burst and started spraying water out everywhere. We moved our stuff out of the way and made an emergency call to the front desk. Thankfully the water flowed out into the hall instead of back into the room, but still was a big mess. Had a bunch of housekeeping people in who helped clean things up. The maintenance guy fixed the leak, and everything was back to normal within an hour or so. Gave the housekeeping ladies a really nice tip today. T_T

6/28/2013 8:00 PM: Learned something interesting about Thai culture. We were talking about it, Aiden thought he remembered something about it, and we looked it up. 

Apparently in Thailand it's actually illegal to export a Buddha statue from Thailand. We were discussing possible souvenirs, but apparently this one is one you can't do. The only Buddha images you can take out of Thailand are the small ones meant to wear around your neck.

You might think it's just something to prevent cultural looting and the theft on antiques, but it goes further than that. It's not only illegal to export ancient Buddha statues, it's illegal to export brand new ones. 

It comes down to a matter of culture, in a way that's very strange to my American background. I was raised Catholic. To put a statue of Jesus or the Virgin Mary in your backyard, on a shelf, or by your front door, is seen as a sign of respect. It's a positive thing. 

In Thai Buddhist culture, this not the case. If you were to put a statue of Buddha out on your front stoop, it would be seen as disrespectful. A Buddha statue is not to be just put on display as a decoration. In their culture, a Buddha statue should only be displayed either in a temple or in a household shrine. 

As such, the only way you can export a Buddha statue is through a whole bunch of paperwork. You either need to be a monk yourself, or you need a letter from a Buddhist temple saying that you are Buddhist and that you will be using the statue for religious purposes. 

7/1/2013 2:00 PM: Not much going on in the last few days. Just sitting around healing in the hotel. On Saturday, Ameila went off to SRS, heard from her she got through it fine. So that's good. :)

Let's see. On Saturday we left the hotel for the first time. The nurse cleared us to go on short trips around the neighborhood, so we went to the nearby mall, bought a few groceries and got some dinner at McDonalds of all places. Out in front of the McDonalds is a very interesting Ronald McDonald statue, apparently all the McDonalds in Thailand have Ronald's like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ronwai01.JPG).

Medically not much going on. Have the final consultation with Chettawut this Saturday, the 6th. The nurse is going to try to bring us the documentation before that so we can go to the embassy to get it notarized. Got cleared to move to the larger size dilator, I started using the number two dilator today.

Just slowly healing, feeling better and stronger each day. We've met two good friends here, both Amelia and one of the waitstaff we've gotten to know quite well.

Mainly just passing the time on reddit and watching TV. Made it all the way through Breaking Bad, now watching a mix of Dexter and Star Trek The Next Generation.

7/6/2013 1:00 PM: Been too long since I posted an update. The internet has been extremely spotty for some reason, so sometimes we get connections, sometimes not. 

Let's see. This last week largely just much of the same. We're no longer confined to the hotel. We've been frequently walking across the street to the huge [Seacon Square Mall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seacon_Square). We'll wake up in the morning, get breakfast down in the hotel restaurant, hang out in the room for a bit, then later go out and do some shopping and get dinner at the mall. The prices are really good, so it's tempting to shop too much. I would love to buy a bunch of clothes, but I need to hold back. This trip is breaking the bank enough as is. Mostly just getting a few gifts for family and friends.

Medically, everything is fine. Dilation is going well for me. I'm using the second dilator size, will start with a 10-15 minute session with #1, then half hour to an hour with #2. I'll either do three half hour sessions or two one hour sessions each day. The nurse still comes in daily to check up on us and perform a basic examination of my parts.

On Wednesday I got my final surgery letter from the doc, listing the procedures I've had. I needed to get it notarized to change my birth certificate, so we hired a translator experienced with doing this. Doctor Chettawut's staff recommended him. Yesterday, he accompanied us down to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, took care of the whole process. We would have been really lost without him. Totally worth paying for. His fee was 6000 baht, the Ministry charged 1200 baht, and cab fares and road tolls brought the total cost to about 6000 baht, or about $200. Totally worth it if you need the doctor's signature to be certified.

Today we went to see Chettawut one last time for the final consultation. I had to change into a hospital robe, sit on the surgical table and get in the stirrups. He performed an exam with a speculum. He then performed the first douching. Oh so much fun. :/ Turns out everything is healing very well. No skin grafts or sutures have failed. Everything is as it should be. Dilation has been going well. 

Aiden also had his follow-up exam, just inspecting the surgery site. Unfortunately, this was complicated by his condition. He's been inexplicably nauseous this morning. We're guessing some of the sushi we had last night must have been prepared wrong, as he seems to have a stomach virus of some sort. He'll get through it. It seems like one of those things that will be there and gone in a day. Still, while I was getting my exam he was sitting in Chettawut's office bathroom throwing up. :/

Other than that, not much left. We have another three days to do as we please. If we're feeling well, we might try to make it to a temple or something. But it's hard, as it hurts me especially to be on my feet too long. Our flight leaves late Wednesday night.

7/12/2013 12:15 PM Central Time: Finally got home last night. 

The last few days in Thailand were fairly uneventful. Just finished up with the regular routine. Got up for breakfast in the morning, the nurse came by after that for an exam, and we would hang out in the room and usually hang out at the mall a bit in the afternoon and evening. We got some gifts for friends and did a little shopping for ourselves. Great clothing prices! Medically everything is healing quite well.

Before leaving, I was really concerned about dilation and the return trip. From the time we left the hotel room to the time we got back to our house took about 36 hours. That's 36 hours I couldn't dilate, and I was worried about damaging things. I asked the doctor and nurses if this was OK, and if maybe I should try to dilate at the airport or something. They assured me it would be fine and it's pretty normal. I could just do a long dilation session before and after, and everything should be fine.

On Wednesday we said our goodbyes. Said goodbye to Amelia as well as Morgan, a trans gal from France we met while there. We packed everything up and got ready. Our flight was at 11:55 PM Bangkok time. We left the hotel around 8 PM, and I did a long dilation session from like 4:30-7:00 PM. When we finally got home, things were a bit tight and it hurt, but no real damage done. I think all the flights did was set the dilation schedule back a bit.

The flights themselves were just long and bleh. Dr. Chettawut gave us a letter which did help quite a bit. The letter requested that we be given seats with extra leg room, for medical reasons. They upgraded us to a bulkhead seat on the flight from Bangkok to Frankfurt, and we got a free upgrade from economy to economy plus from Frankfurt to Houston. The flights were still rough, but it helped. Took some sleeping pills on the first flight, but unfortunately we were surrounded by a half dozen infants and numerous toddlers. Sleep for a half hour, get woken up by a screaming kid. Sleep for another half hour, get woken up by a screaming kid. I don't know what people are thinking taking infants on 11 hour intercontinental flights. T_T

It was rough, but eventually we did make it back. We're back home now, I start work on Monday. Can't ride my scooter for another two months, so Aiden will be giving me a ride to work for awhile. Severely jet lagged, internal clock all kinds of messed up, but I have a few days to adjust.

And with that, I suppose that's it. SRS trip is done and this long diary is finally done as well. Hope some folks out there can get something from this. Overall, I think we had a really good experience. There were some big bumps along the way, such as the initial flight nightmare and the troubles Aiden had right after surgery, but we got through it. We met some wonderful people over in Bangkok and I can definitely recommend it to anyone considering SRS. Chet and his staff are wonderful, and I think I made a great choice going there. If anyone reading, now or in the future, has any further questions, feel free to message me and I'll be happy to respond. :)",,False,,t5_2r4b9,1373650349.0,,,True,t3_1g2o4v,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1g2o4v/as_promised_my_srs_thread/,

**How can I be sure?**

You can't.  Life has no guarantees.  Ask yourself questions in terms of motivation rather than certitude.  A more useful question is to ask 'Am I willing to be wrong about this?'

**Do I have permission?**

Yes.  Even if your asking this question takes 4 pages and you've self-hated to the point of asking this in the most convoluted way possible, yes.

**Can someone (the trans community usually) be a proxy in which I can invest society's authority regarding gender compliance and get external permission to do this?**

No.

**Can I prove I am really sure to those who are hostile to my right to choose?**

No.

**Even if the person is me?**

Even if the person is you, you still can't.

**How can I frame my coming out so that the results are perfect and nothing bad ever happens?**

You can't.  Just say it, as plainly and calmly as possible.

Reddit, that is.  But I feel like I should post this for what friends 'she' may have had here.  This is serious, but if trolls want to just neg this post into oblivion.. well, I don't expect much better.  Hopefully there is someone here who was a friend of Kaiosyne, because I believe you should know, and I have no other way of telling you.

  Sometime between Friday night and Saturday morning (27/28 Jan), Kaiosyne passed away.  Not of any obvious, violent cause, but it wasn't until about 4 hours ago that his roommate noticed he was lying under layers of blankets on the couch, unresponsive.  She had been away for most of the weekend.  The ambulance and police were called, and we won't know how he went for another few days, but from what I saw, he did not appear to be in pain.  She said that when she touched him, he was cold, but if anything, he looked like he was dozing off, ready to twitch awake at any moment as he often would when someone came in the room.

  I use 'he', despite the fact that he wanted to be a 'she', for I have known him as a male for most of his life.  As he was over 30 and I've known him since 6th grade, you can do the math.  I'll use the pronouns I choose, I've earned that right.  Although some troll will probably make snarky commentary about it, the last words from the paramedics were ""She's gone.""  So, I guess he got his final wish, to the point where even normal mundies were fooled.  I guess that qualifies as 'passing' in your lingo.  I wish it didn't come at such a price.

  I regret that I did not get more time with him, perhaps even to the point where he would be fully 'her' and not 'he' in my mind.  I regret teasing him about being so lazy the last day I saw him (Thursday), always sleeping the day away and being active at night.  I regret that I did not get more time with him before he went.  I regret that we didn't get at least one more game of D&amp;D in before he went, despite the fact he asked me to start up a game every week...I regret being too busy to do so.  I regret being the only one who's going to have to tell his boyfriend in jail that the one person who loved him despite his crimes is no more, and that he is now alone.

  However... I do not regret giving him food that last day I saw him, when he had nothing left to eat.  I do not regret the day before that, when he was driven crazy by his roommate's taunting and decided to get drunk, nor do I regret holding on to him when he cried about how everything was going wrong in his life... because he also said that moment was a 'positive experience' for him, and reminded him of the love he would eventually have.  I do not regret when he showed me pictures of his transition and there was one picture that stood out, where he looked just like a born woman, smiling all flirty, and when I pointed this out he became so incredibly happy.  I do not regret being his friend for so long, despite all the things he did and had done to him, despite our completely opposite stations and positions in life and all the crap we went through.  I don't regret it, even though being his friend could have lost me my job of ten years.

  I hope I won't have to regret posting this hear.  I hope that if there are people here who thought of him in a positive way, they can remember, or offer a prayer, or do whatever it is to ease him on his way and remember his life.

  I hope his family finally learns to love him when they realize he is gone.  I hope they can give him a better epitaph than this one, and their hearts soften after the way they treated him when he came out.  I hope no one else has to go through what he did.

  RIP my brother/sister, and by far oldest friend.  There will be at least one who misses you.

  UPDATE 4PM, CST, Jan 30th:  I have called his family, send out the message over the friend-net to all those who knew him.  The coroner called, saying that he did not die to physical trauma, to choking, or (more importantly), due to any blood clots or burst blood vessels from the anti-androgen, artificial-estrogen transition drugs.  I was afraid that might have been the case, which would be terrible, as the transition was the thing that had turned his life around, giving him happiness, calming his crazy moods, and--most importantly--leading him to clean up his life and start taking care of himself after almost two and a half decades of self-abuse.  I was also afraid of how to express that to people here, as it might scare others away from the happiness they could find.  Fortunately, it was not the cause.  Not directly.

  The cause, instead, seems to be the combination of malnutrition (he purposefully starved himself to lose 'masculine-located' fat so he could then fatten up with 'feminine-located' fat), some buildup of advanced cardiopulminary disease caused by twenty years of chain smoking, alcohol, and drug abuse, and potentially too much alcohol weakning his system at the time... not to mention depression.  He was simply attacked at all sides... nickel-and-dimed to death.  To be fair, this means most of it is, indeed, caused by self-neglect.  Which is a tragedy, as he had cut down on all harsh drug use, and what he was doing was making him so much happier with his own body.

  It is an important lesson for all transitioning here, however... please, don't try to go too fast.  Don't rush through the process.  You'll have a much longer, happier life if you don't try to burn through it as quickly as possible.  Take care of your body, make sure you get the nourishment you need.  You'll have plenty of time to lose weight the normal way, plenty of time to enjoy becoming what you want to be.  Don't neglect yourself.  Don't think you are alone.  He never thought anyone outside his family would show up at his funeral service.  Thanks to talking with them, I know at least half a dozen spread out over four states will be there.  I wish I could be too.  I will certainly try.  I have spoken at the deaths of many in my own family.  I consider Cora no less than they.  And I would wish that no one else should have such sorrows.

  As for all who criticize my use of pronouns... try not to get lost in the thick grasses of your own prejudices.  There is a clear path here, and you are missing it.  You have your attitudes, but you knew not his.  Nor do you yet know mine.  You are missing what is truly important for something that is little more than window dressing.  Both what you want and what you think you know are irrelevant here, because it isn't about you.  It's not about me 
either.  It's about someone who I and many others shared a long life with that has tragically been cut short.  It's about people who miss him, it's about the man he loved and wanted to be with now being left alone with nobody to talk to for the next few years in prison, a life of expected love now burned away.  It's about his family, and his father who wants him cremated and his remains shipped back in a little metal urn so that he doesn't have to bear the shame of people seeing the feminine body of his own son-in-law in the casket during the funeral... despite my pleading to the contrary and pointing out how the transition made his skin smooth and youthful and soft where before it had been dried and pitted and ravaged by the events of his life, how it was a physical sign of happiness regained after so much sorrow.

  ""He"", ""She"", etc, are just stupid little terms to fight over.  They are useless labels bandied about while the flame of a wonderful friend's life has been snuffed out.  You think he lived and died so people could use pronouns correctly?  That his goal in life was striking a blow for gender grammar?  No.  He was and remains more complicated than that, and by far more important.  Your scorn, no matter how much, is little more than the biting of gnats while my heart bleeds from the knife of his loss.  You can dress it all up with the loaded terms and force your own prejudices into words if you want, but it doesn't change that a bit, and if you want some of my blood, you are free to take it.  Just know that I had his own permission and approval, that he appreciated it more when I referred to him as a 'she' or 'her' by accident naturally in conversation rather than some simple mental adjustment to be repeated by rote.  The way it made his eyes light up and a grin split his face...he preferred those moments, called it 'honesty', and valued it more than the other.  So did I.  So do I.  The details of that memory are mine alone to cherish.  You may have this pale shadow I have shared.  You may even feel free to bleed me with it.

  I appreciate all you who understood the intent of my post and weren't led to insensate fury over how I wrote it.  Such wise and loving people are rare to find, and I would at least let you know you have the appreciation you may have been lacking.  I appreciate the fact his close friends back home, and even his mother, have finally come to accept him, even if it is a little late, and that they were moved by my call to give Cora the people in death that were unable to be there in life.  I even appreciate you who both knew Cora Hillbairn and directed your fury my way... for that means SHE (you get one) truly had friends despite feeling so terribly depressed and alone.  

  That's another lesson anyone here should learn if they haven't already... for as alone and lost as you may feel, there are people out there who cherish and love you.  Learn to see and accept it, don't make them have to make a post like after you are gone.  Live happier than before, secure in the choice you've made to become happier.  Don't burn too fast, you have time, you have love, and you are not ever alone.",,False,,t5_2r4b9,True,,,True,t3_p2nrn,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/p2nrn/rip_kaiosyne/,

I am a mother of 4, my third child was born a male. From the time he was able to toddle about he would put on his older sisters clothes and ""dress up"". He would dance about in my high heels, play with my make up and so on. All little ones, boys included, do this I know. Assuming that it was the average type of imaginary play didn't think a second thought about it. He never grew out of the ""phase"" like the other boys. That was fine, we got him his own dress up princess clothes, even got him his own girl clothes to play in at home. The older he got the more aware I became that things might be more then just play. He only preferred to play with Barbies, and dolls and standard girl toys. He liked Dora, Hannah Montana, and all the standard girl shows. His natural instincts were to be the typical young girl. We are a very open minded family, never been one to believe girls play with dolls and boys play with trucks. So we just let him be him. A couple years ago my niece began a relationship with a man in the middle of the FtoM transition. My son had asked before why he had boy parts but felt like he should have girl parts. When he met my nieces boyfriend, he told me that he wanted to be a girl. I don't think he understood before then you could change (he was only 6). By this time he was dressing in only his girl clothes at home. He felt more comfortable that way and he should be able to dress however he wants at home. Home should be the place that you can always be yourself, and be loved and accepted no matter what, period. He is now almost 10. He only speaks of himself in the future tense as female, but present tense male. I used to encourage him to dress in male clothes when he went to school or out in public. We had issues over other bigoted issues in our very small town public schools, so I started homeschooling this last year. He rarely if ever dresses in male clothes now. That's perfectly fine. How ever he is happiest, who ever he is, we love him for him. That's the background, here are my questions. I want to encourage and support him in any and all decisions he makes, but where does the line cross? I need to know if I am letting him make choices way to big for his age? Also, moving into a different school district this next year, do I let him dress feminine to school? Did you know from day one? I want to let him be his self, but also don't want him to look back and feel like we pushed him? I need feedback badly, with public school on the horizon and puberty just around the corner I need to know the right choices. So many more questions, I can't even think of them all.

Son gender identifies as female, he is 10, lots of questions.

I figured out how to edit!!! I talked to my child, for hours. I had no idea that she had already been thinking of ways to save money for surgical options as soon as possible. I broke my heart a bit to think she had dealing with those thoughts alone. We talked about talking to someone to help her through the confusing parts, and about the puberty meds. I didn't know she was already looking at body hair and hands and feet like they were someone else's. Kind of feel like I failed a bit as a mom there. Things are tight and at the moment no insurance, but I will move heaven and earth to make it happen. I don't know how to link, but a pic of Tay's first day out as a girl is on my profile. R sewing, Halloween she was Marie Antoinette. I will try to figure out how to link it. That was the day she went out in full dress. At the end of the night she as that she was the prettiest of all the princesses, I believe she was right.

I am, above all, a student of physics. I sat through the lecture and I understand that if you want to do work, you have to increase the entropy of the universe. There are no practical processes that are reversible. To do something, to expend energy, is to forever change reality as we know it.

I watched a video today at my school - it gets better. Many of my comrades were there by obligation - forced to go for class. I chose to go. I didn't pay, I donated nothing but some of my time. 

When I was there, I saw a college student - someone my age - declare that she was a transgendered female on a twenty foot tall projection screen. I listened to thousands of watts of audio power beat those words into my skull. That's how it all started. 

All she did was sit down in front of the camera and talked. Those words were spoken months ago - edited and diced for running time. But it didn't matter. For all I cared, she could have been right there in front of me. She told everyone - a thousand people - the truth. Once the DVDs are distributed - that's thousands more. Once the video hits the Internet - that's six billion people who know. 

If she could tell six billion - then I can tell one person. After the movie was over, I went to the reception. I talked to one of the women who put the movie together, and I thanked her. 

And then I told her the truth. Took about two minutes. 

And it was the best damn high I've ever had. 

I've spent the last decade lying, deceiving myself at every opportunity. No more bull - no more lying. 

Maybe it's the end of who I used to be - I don't really care about that. What I care about is the beginning of something new - the beginning of something real. 

There's a group meeting next week - and I'm going to be there.

I had an emotional episode 2 days ago, to the extent that my parents brought me to the hospital. I came home later that day, but during my bout, I had slipped that I'm tired of hiding things from them, so they sat me down and told me that I could tell them anything; I scoffed in my mind, but felt so raw emotionally that I went against my feelings and just said it: ""I'm transgender."" 

I expected my life to be over at that moment. 

My father didn't change his expression, it still being a serious, but not angry look, and my mother was crying (as usual, just her thing). My father nodded and said, ""The only that upsets me is how long you had to go shouldering this without our help."" 

Ouch, right in the feels. Quite needless to say, I started crying and I put my head on the table just trying to take in what he said. 

To make a long story short, fast forward to today when my mother told me he's said nothing but positive things about me to her, exclaiming that he's just happy I felt like I could tell them and wasn't afraid of them. My mom said what I am taking away from all of this. 

""No matter where you decide to go with this, we will always support and love you."" 

I'm still trying to process all of this, and still feel awkward that they know now, but I've had almost 10 years of built up stress just wiped away, so even though I'm confused in a way, it's a good confused.

Social anxiety, and whatnot.  I'm working on it.

Which leads me to tonight.  A breakthrough, though a painful one.  

So.  Got dressed pretty much to the nines tonight to go watch a local drag show.  I don't dress in what I consider ""drag"".  Just pretty myself up like any girl would.  Was wearing my favorite dress, did my makeup in a ""going to a bar but not flashy"" way, and was feeling fab.

Show started late, but was great and I and my friend stayed after and talked to the performers for a good while.

Head home.  I have to drop my friend off at her apartment first.  Flashing blue lights.

!!!!

So.  Yeah.  First encounter with the law while dressed as a girl.  And as totally and unmistakably dressed as a girl as I pretty much could possibly be.  =P

Give them my ID and what not.  Another car pulls up with two more officers.  And I have to do the field sobriety thing.

I've only had like 4 drinks over the last 6 hours, and nothing in the last 2 but water.  So when they asked if I could do the field sobriety test, I said yes.

So.  There I am.  My favorite girl outfit, parading in front of 4 male officers proving my sobriety.  Which I passed fine, as expected.  But, then, for some reason, my registration was evidently listed as suspended in the computer.

This baffles me.  I sit there and talk to the officer for a good while, and he tells me that he doesn't know why either, and if it was not so late at night on a weekend he could call and ask.  But, he can't.  Tow truck is coming, so sorry take it up with the judge.  Basically.

I was very polite to the various officers, and the one who was the ""lead officer"", I guess...or whatever they call the one who does all the talking while the others flank you with their hands near their guns as they stare silently...anyway, he looked at me and said, 

""I'm sorry, ma'am.""  He met my eye.  I could see he meant it.  

So I had to walk about 4 miles home past midnight as a woman, after diving into a world of gender differences and then a modern gauntlet of confidence.  Followed by some serious time for reflection.

And, you know what?  I feel more powerful than ever.  Damn it.  After that shit...I no longer am afraid of anyone ""finding out"" anything about me being trans.  There's a period of time in which i am going to ""not pass"" as I transition, but that's okay.  I can handle it.

She said sure and that I could even tell my boyfriend if I don't think he'd freak out.  I told them both and they were both super supportive.  Mother also scolded me for this.  It's not their business etc etc.  I said it's [sister's name]'s business, and she told me to go ahead.  Mother - ""well he's always trying to please you of course he said yes"". I asked her ""do you think he (I used this to make her less uncomfortable) should be ashamed? do you think this is a phase?"" to which she replied ""you're missing the point."" I said thats not what I asked you.  she says ""i don't have the answers and neither does [sisters name].  if you wanted someone to talk to about it you should've spoken to his parents"" (referring to her and my step father… two ignoramuses.  my sister didn't want to tell my step father and she was even scared to tell my mother… the only reason we told my mother is because she's 13)

I asked my sister if she was certain this is what she wanted.  She said yes enthusiastically.  She told me a weight was lifted off her chest and she couldn't wait to start… I don't want my ignorant mother taking my sisters happiness away and replacing it with shame!

((Mother did set up a doctor's appointment… hopefully the doctor isn't an idiot))

edit: FWIW the first few things I did were thank my sister for trusting me, asked her if she was certain (so I could gauge what kind of advice to give), and then told her we should get her in touch with doctors so she will have all the information and guidance she needs (therapist to sort out thoughts since she said she's been down, and a physician to help with the transformation).

""We'd like to take a moment to invite &lt;my name&gt; up here.  &lt;My name&gt; has been with us for only one year but it is our honor and privledge to award him with the highest honor we have, the unit citation award for bravery in the line of duty.""

""Hey....upper management knows about your 'condition'.  We want you to know &lt;hospital that manages our service&gt; is behind you 100%, whenever you're ready you just need to make an appointment with HR"".

&gt;Thanks for coming to COMPANY this morning, it was good for MANAGER1 and me to meet you. As I explained that I do believe that COMPANY can offer your career growth opportunity. Meanwhile we are also happy with your qualification. We decided to extend you an offer. You should receive an offer letter from MANAGER2, who is our VP in charge of structural engineering.

&gt;Again, I thank you for your interests in COMPANY and really hope you will find the opportunity here is attractive.

&gt;Have a good weekend!

So yeah, by 9 PM I was passed out in a drunken depression. Then this email gets sent at 11:30 PM. Basically the company that I interviewed with yesterday morning decided to offer me a position. I literally got hired and fired in the same day. T_T

I'm not going to start the new job immediately. I told them I would give my old employer two weeks notice, so that's what I'll do. The next two weeks are a paid vacation courtesy of the vacation time I had stored up at my old company. I figure I'll start March 25th

This will be a big change. I didn't out myself when I interviewed with them. So unless they find out through a background check or something, I don't plan on outing myself. Most or all of the people there won't know my background. 

So I guess I'll get another chance. I'm not going to repeat what happened at my old company. That I'm sure of. Hell, I'm never going to log into reddit there. I'm basically going stealth there, so I don't want to use this screen name or have logs of me visiting asktg or the other subs. I'll still be around, but not during the workday. 

The last 24 hours have been a roller coaster. I started out yesterday morning feeling amazing after a great interview. A few hours later I got fired and was down for the rest of the day. Then I woke up early this morning and found this email.

So thanks for all your kind words and encouragement. It's not 100% certain yet, but I should be receiving an offer letter on Monday. :)

Three weeks ago, we were together at a Bar with another friend (Marc). Julie introduced me to a friend of hers, Kate. Kate gave me a really intense stare, like she knew me. I noticed that she had a somewhat prominent brow bone. I wondered if she might be trans, and knew me from my YouTube blog, or something. Once we're out of the bar, I proceeded to ask Julie:

Me: ""So Julie, your friend Kate and I, we have something in common?""

Julie: ""You mean is she trans? No. You're both into girls, you have that in common.""

Me: ""Oh, well, she gave me that intense stare, it made me wonder.""

Marc: ""Maybe Kate was into you.""

Julie: ""Well, maybe, but, you have no chance with her, she's just really into girls... Real girls. She's really not into guys. If you even tried approaching her and she found out you were trans, she would reject you.""

At that point, I started feeling increasingly offended. Julie kept babbling on about how her friend Kate was too much of a true lesbian to be into me. She clearly implied that I was not a woman in her eyes, to her, I was guy, not a ""real girl"". I felt enraged.

I then found out that Julie and Kate had a relationship. Maybe Julie was just trying to ""protect her territory"". I let myself forgive her.

Fast-forward a couple hours. I somehow managed to get over my rage. The party had moved to someone's house. Julie and I were sitting next to each other on a couch. Other people at the party were making out, things were getting steamy and sexual tension was building between Julie and I. We'd actually fooled around in the past, I found her attractive, and I assumed she felt the same about me. She was cuddling me. Yet something was off, I could tell, she was holding back.

I asked her if I made her uncomfortable for some reason. She answered very directly, she told me that she found me very attractive, and that she'd thought about having sex with me before, but that she just couldn't conceive of doing it.

""There's just something really weird about the idea of having sex with a woman who has a penis, it doesn't fit, it's too strange to me, I don't think I can do it"".

At that point, I felt like our friendship had been compromised. Julie was some kind of transphobe who viewed me as ""not a real woman"" and somewhat of a freak.

---------

Three weeks later, I saw Julie again at a common friend's birthday party. I tried to be friendly despite what happened. After a few drinks, Julie began to tell me that she'd found out something from a friend... It turned out that her friend Kate *was* in fact trans. Julie had slept with her. She'd even gone down on her multiple times, but never realized anything was different. Kate's very passable and post-op, what can I say... I blurt out:

""Her surgeon did a very good job!""

I started to get a big grin on my face. Oh my god! Not only was I right from the start, the girl who rejected me because having sex with a trans person seemed too weird, the girl who told me I wasn't enough of a ""real girl"" for her ""true lesbian"" friend has, in fact, had already had sex with a trans woman *multiple times* without even knowing!

I was too tall, too fat, my shoulders were too broad, I acted weird, etc. etc. etc. You probably know how it goes. And, of course, my life really would be easier if I were shaped a little differently. 

But everyone seemed to think ""passing"" was a binary thing. You either ""passed"" or you ""didn't pass"". Now that I've come out and live as myself, I've found reality isn't like that at all. People will ""sir"" you in one outfit and ""ma'am"" you in a different one. A woman may think you're a cis girl, and a man at the same party may think you're a cis guy. You may pass in Nebraska, but not in California, or vice versa. In the same day, I've had one friend tell me I could never possibly pass to anyone, and another friend not realize I was trans, even after being told there was a trans woman at our seven-person table.

So, my advice to my younger self would be: There's no way you can just ""not pass"" to everyone forever. But in a particular situation, you could only pass, say, 20% of the time.

I have a different perspective, and I want to share it:

I understand wanting to be cis, and I understand why many of us are ashamed to be trans, but quite frankly that is stupid bullshit.

Being transgender is the best thing you can possibly be.

It means you have suffered, lived in a world that feared and hated you,  maybe even to the point of de-humanizing you, and you have not been destroyed.  You have accepted yourself, despite the entire world's condemnation.  That is powerful.  You stood up to the entire world.  There are not many people who have done that.  You are one of the few who found love and strength inside yourself, instead of depending on an outside source.  Sometimes this is even directly acknowledged: ""You're so brave,"" is something we are often told by others in awe of our inner strength.

And if you have transitioned, you may have access to special, secret knowledge.  You may have lived life from two different gender's perspective.  This is INCREDIBLY valuable.  You understand the issues confronting both masculinity and femininity in a way no one else does.  You may have even had the privilege of having a mind and body which have experienced testosterone AND estrogen, and you know how it each of those hormones affects the way you think and feel.  I've become the ""go to"" girl for hetero-relationship advice, because my experience has allowed me to understand the male and female perspectives better than anyone.  All my male friends come to me for ""girl advice"" (what does this text MEAN?).  My female friends want me to explain why their boyfriend acts the way he does, and I CAN.

There are countless other benefits that come from the transgender perspective.  I find more every day.  I would never give up being trans so I could be just another cis.

I'm curious if this is the majority opinion of trans* people or if many people take the opportunity to educate people.

I'm prompted to ask this question because just a few minutes ago I was at a local food store buying some things to make for lunch and was asked by a cashier ""Are you going through a.... uh... change?... um... thing?""

I laughed a little to put her at ease and answered that yes I was. She proceeded to ask a few personal questions that I know a great many people on here would have felt were too personal. I took the chance to educate her on some basics.

The thing is, I have a hard time getting mad at people for simply being curious. She wasnt trying to be mean, or malicious and was very, very embarrassed to be asking such questions.

And this is something I notice more and more as I get myself off: not only do I self-lube when I'm turned on, but when I'm done my knickers/sheets are *soaked*.

My question: how does that even *work?*

I had the usual penile-inversion-plus-clit surgery in London on the NHS. The literature they gave me at the time said I'd need to use lube for sex, and so did practically everyone I spoke to. I was okay with this. And for the first maybe six months after it seemed safe to start trying, it was the case.

Over the next four or so years, though, I've found that I've become increasingly, ah, responsive to stimuli. Foreplay or erotica will have me damp enough to take a finger (whether mine or someone else's) or a toy inside me and also across my clit with no friction, and when I come I *really* come. Over the years the orgasms have got more intense -- which I expected, they said some of the nerves would take a while to heal -- and the amount of fluid I've produced at the point of orgasm and after has increased.

I don't get how. I don't have that SRS where they take a bit of your colon, I don't have anything special.

Don't get me wrong, I couldn't be happier! I'm just curious as to how my body is doing this, given that everyone including the doctors told me it wouldn't. If anyone even knows!

Given how many trans people are somewhat aware of their feelings when they are young, how many young people may not realize successful transition is feasible, and how large of a difference beginning transition-related treatment early can make in a person's life, I think it might be good if it was screened for by school nurses/psychologists as part of checkups in public schools, and part of sex ed curriculum.

Now, my memory of school is a bit faded and outdated, but if I recall correctly, this kind of thing wasn't covered, and there were several checkups and sex-ed classes I encountered in public school.

Here's how I'd imagine this could work, based on what I remember of school:

Sex ed: At the various points where sex ed is covered, transgender conditions should be covered a bit. ('Sometimes people's mental sex and body sex don't match, these are the symptoms, it's not a choice, and there are treatments to make the body match, ask us if you have questions.')

Health checkups by school nurses/psychologists: Added onto the existing health/mental health checkups that happen at various stages in public school, perhaps the nurse/psychologist could ask the student if they were aware that sometimes people feel like a girl but have a boy body, and vice versa, and that treatment is possible. Then they'd ask if they felt that way often, but wouldn't question further unless there were signs of trans-ness.

*Does this sound like something that'd be feasible and helpful, or does it seem to push an agenda or go too far? Got any input? Does anyone know about the feasibility of such a thing?*

I thought I was trans, had many appointments, and even made it to the point where I had my letter (my doctor is great but when you think you have a goal, it's easy to start to sell it pretty hard and convincing). Through a series of life changes I was put into a spot where I was able to fully realize what I thought I wanted.

And then I didn't want it.

It wasn't sudden, but through this whole time of coming out and exploring, I didn't want to keep moving forward. It didn't feel right and not in the it's-easier-to-remain-male way. I just felt it was inevitable and you read so many stories of how people tried so hard to get over it, and you start to panic. I know I did. For the most part this community is great (the entire trans community, not just here on reddit), it really is. That said, there are times when I think there's a bit more pushing, though with great intentions, for someone questioning to just accept it and move forward. I know the intentions are to spare someone the pain of delaying and making it harder than needed, but for every handful of people that really do need the push, there has to be at least one or two that are confused and exploring. I'm sure the numbers are small and clearly not abundant here since they tend to avoid coming back for one reason or another. It's easy to get swept up in the whole thing when you're sorting this out.

I'm not trans and I know that now. I know the umbrella is massive and encompasses a lot of different groups, and so while there might be some part of that I fit in with (I'm not overly masculine, I'm ok with not conforming to gender roles), in the grand scheme, I'm happy with being male. 

Life isn't easy and gender identity is very confusing. I have nothing but the utmost respect for all of you that are being who you really are. I tried playing for the team for while, it wasn't for me, but I'm happy to sit on the sidelines and still cheer for you. I'm not ashamed of any confusion I had or coming out I did. It might have made life a little harder, but I learned a lot about who I am. It's easy to see this moment as me denying, but that's not who I am. I own things and I'm never one to back away no matter how uncomfortable. I'm sure there will be at least one or two ""you'll be back!"" posts. The future is uncertain, but I feel stronger about this than I have anything else. I'm not one to run away from problems. I owned this and it just wasn't for me.

Thank you all for the support under the 1,000 throw away names I used at various times. God speed.

 **Update 7/7**

For a handful of months everything I mentioned above seemed applicable. In the past month, perhaps month and a half, those feelings have come back. I don't know what to do with them. Transition is still something I don't particularly care to do, however I feel increasingly uncomfortable in this past month, with today being the absolute worst in a long time. I said I would come back and update as things went along and I am trying to stay true to that. For anyone I've offended by having to recant a little, I am sorry. I'm not ready or wanting to move forward with this still, I just feel uncomfortable.

Skype. Also how the heck do I get her grandparents to stop using the male pronouns?!

People seem to think it's okay to make the most offensive comments to me, as they think I'm just like them. Racism, homophobia, transphobia, I've heard it all. But today took the cake.

I was chatting with a guy I've known for well over a year. He's a barback at a gay bar. He's a joker. Up until today, I thought of him as a friend. But today, while we're discussing his workplace, he turns to me and says ""So last night, at work, there was this tranny."" I put on my poker face. He continues, ""And all night I was staring at... It... And all I could think about was,"" and here he mimes firing a gun, ""Pop pop, putting two bullets right in its fucking head.""

Unable to think of any sort of reply, I said I had to get back to work and walked away. I don't know if I'll ever be able to make eye contact with him again. It disgusts me... Not only that... A) he thought this was an okay thing to say, but B) he thought it was okay to say this to ME. I am fucking sick and tired of being seen as a ""regular guy"". Every fucking racist, sexist, homophobic, and especially transphobic dick in my city thinks that I'm on their fucking side. I can't even imagine what a nightmare coming out will be.

Basically... I needed to vent. All day I've been hearing him over and over in my head and... Ugh. I need hugs. I know there's not exactly a question here, but /r/transgender doesn't allow self-posting and I needed to get this off my chest. I guess I can ask... What the fuck would you say to something like that? How do you respond to that level of transphobia? I don't think I could say anything to him, I'm kind of afraid of him now. But...

I don't know if I should just leave the link or repeat the whole post but I guess it's better to both so here's the post copy and pasted:

this is a throwaway because some of the relevant information is personal.

My mother was harassed by [covenant aviation security](http://www.covenantsecurity.com/cas/) this morning flying out of SFO on the basses of her sexual identity.

She is male to female transgender and has changed her name. I understand how this would lead to a more thorough line of questioning but she was harassed, mocked, and verbally abused in front of a line of 50+ people to the point of tears (hard to do, she's tough as nails). There was no privacy offered and no sensitivity granted. Also you should know that she travels about twice a week (that's four flights a week) and had all the appropriate paper work to clear up the matter. She has flown numerous times since the name and appearance change without a problem (in fact she is well known and well liked among the staff at SJC)

I do not know much more than that because she is so embarrassed that she cannot even speak about it. I am pissed. I would be willing to punch [Jerry Barry](http://www.covenantsecurity.com/cas/cas_team.aspx) right in his fucking ear. In the fucking ear, man. I don't know what I can do. I feel like this is unacceptable beyond them even grabbing my ass.

I'm thinking I should e-mail Covenant but don't know what to say or if it would fall on deaf ears. I also don't know if I should contact the ACLU. I feel like she's too embarrassed to even say anything and without her stepping up I'm unable to defend her.
Also, what is it specifically that is supposed to be protecting her from this?

I used to be really active here some months ago. I have been on estradiol 6 months as of yesterday, and I wanted to make a final post before retiring this account.

Things are going okay for me. I’m working towards getting my Ph.D., I'm feeling happier, I really like the changes to my body so far, and I’m talking to my father again. I’m still not out, but I hope to be within the next few months. When I first started dealing with my gender issues, I had a lot of doubt about whether I was trans, and it has been a really complicated process figuring things out. For those who may have followed my posts either from the time I posted, after, or in the future: I now know that, yes, I really am trans.

I want to give some advice to anyone who is questioning. Every trans person’s process of recognizing their transsexuality is different. Some people know they are the wrong sex from their earliest memories. I wasn’t completely sure until I was in my late-20s and 5 months on estradiol. If you are questioning, do not assume that comparison and contrast to trans people’s narratives will give you an answer. Sure, you may find some clues, but everyone is different, trans or cis, and you can make yourself sick if all you do is measure yourself against others.

So how do you figure out if you are trans or not? I can’t give you an answer. I don’t think anyone can. Any specific piece of advice you receive from others on the subject may or may not be helpful to you. 

I will give you one more set of advice, which can be applied to more than trans-questioning. Don’t have everything rely on one question or fact. Keep an open mind. Question your assumptions. Never forget that what you want and need to be happy should have an important role in your thinking.

Lastly, be strong. Whatever you do, be strong.

I want to say thank you to everyone on this sub-reddit who answered my questions, offered me support and advice, and helped me feel better about who I am.

I just wanted to say thanks for all the helpful advice and commentary I got from everyone on my last thread. It certainly gave me and my dad a lot of insight about this issue.

After our denial of health insurance, we proceeded to write a bunch of letters and try to contact whoever we could to understand this policy, the policies of other insurance agencies, and see if there was anything we could do to change it. We approached Cigna about our experiences with Blue Cross Blue Shield of IL automatically denying anyone who has changed gender for health insurance, and they said they don't automatically deny individuals who have changed genders, so we had that option if need be.

As for BCBSIL, we wrote a letter to the president about our experience and how we feel wronged for this automatic denial without regard to actual medical history. A few days ago we received a call from an upper level executive who offered to expedite a review of our formal appeal on their decision. Long story short, we were able to have them reconsider their automatic denial in our case, offer us health insurance (at a fair rate for a 57 year old woman), and they will no longer automatically exclude people who have changed gender for health insurance.

Again, thank you all for the feedback, and I hope this can be a small step in a greater effort to promote understanding and end discrimination for transgendered individuals.

My father taught Sunday school classes for years at our Southern Baptist Church and my mother and I sung in the choir. Both of them are unsupportive of LGBT issues and diversity in general. They are concerned about the ""moral downfall of society."" Apart from all of this, they have nurtured my interests in anthropology and they accept my eclectic group of liberal friends. They have been very loving parents.

Some of you will remember the [coming out letter](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1hno7c/coming_out_letter_to_my_parents/) I posted here a few days ago. After a week with my parents, my wife and I left it at their house with a copy of [PFLAG's ""Welcoming Our Trans Family and Friends""](http://community.pflag.org/Document.Doc?id=202) yesterday morning. I wanted to turn back so many times and grab the letter before they could read it, but I forced myself to keep driving straight home. The phone never rang during the 8-hour drive back.

I got home, took a shower, and was talking to my wife about the momentous day when the phone suddenly rang. She picked it up, my mom asked for me, and then I heard her sad voice say, ""We read your letter, son."" My dad wouldn't get on the phone because, in my mother's words, he was just bottling up his emotions in hopes that the situation would go away. So I knew right then that they weren't going to entirely embrace their new daughter, not that I ever expected that.

Still, one of the first things my mom said to me was that they will love me no matter what I do. She said they had no idea about this and that they were so sorry that I've privately been through so much in the 20 years since puberty. When I told her, ""All that will change about me is my name and my presentation. I know with all my heart that you and dad love me and I believe that love conquers all. You *will* eventually accept me and things *will* get back to normal, but you'll need some time to adjust,"" she asked me to say the same thing to my father, and then handed the phone to him.

A subdued, ""Hey son,"" croaked through the receiver. I repeated what I'd said, and he said, through tears, ""I just feel like I'm losing my son. I don't think you and I can ever have fun together again."" I told him that that's not true, that I still love all the things I've always loved - camping, hiking, going on walks together, going to the movies. My mom said, ""Oh, I've read that that's true. Parents say their children don't really change all that much."" He stayed on the line for the rest of the conversation, but didn't say anything else except a brief plea for compromise (""Can't you just crossdress at home or something?"") and ""I love you no matter what.""

At one point, I told them I was afraid they'd disown me. They both started sobbing and said they would never ever do that. Throughout the whole conversation, my mother went back and forth between positive, supportive statements like, ""I'll need to get your sizes for Christmas,"" ""I really have to broaden my narrow mind and educate myself,"" and ""I'm going to be going to the local PFLAG chapter meetings from now on,"" and negative statements like, ""I'll never be able to call you that name (Jera)"" and ""Nothing you say can ever change my opinion that children need a mom *and* a dad, and gay parents are disgusting."" To the negative statements, I just calmly responded that, for now, I want her accept the idea that all opinions can change in time and this will feel more and more normal as we move forward.

They said that my wife is a ""blessing from God."" When she got on the phone, she told them that she's not sacrificing anything - that she's right where she wants to be.

They are also very nervous about the health risks of HRT.

We talked for 90 minutes, so of course a lot more was said. All in all, I'm actually thrilled with their response. I know it may not seem like it was anything to be happy about, but I'm confident that we'll grow from here. I didn't expect total acceptance right off the bat, but they do at least accept that I am transgender and that I've made the decision to move forward. They did not try to tear down my identity.

It didn't originate from transgender related depression, but rather when a girl turned me down.

HOWEVER! I then got to thinking about everyone here. I've been extremely lucky, I've had exactly zero bad reactions from people I've come out to. Which is insane, most people don't seem to have that sort of streak going.

So this is where I got to thinking about actually *being* transgender. It's the sad fact for most of us here that we weren't born with the genitals of the sex or gender we want at this stage. Now some of us are making a transition (including me) but some aren't. The sad fact many of us have to face is that while we may finally reach a point of social cohesion as our chosen gender, we had to make the move in the first place.

But then again, that's pretty goddamn special isn't it? How many people that **aren't** transgender had the guts to become who they are despite massive social and physical barriers? I may always regret the years during and after male puberty where I have been male, but I also had the strength to say ""No, this isn't right"" and do something about it.

We didn't do this to be strong, or brave, or progressive, but we didn't balk when we had to. And we didn't lie to ourselves that everything was okay, while we walked around with the wrong bits. I may not be pretty, or strong, and I may be smart but I'm not the smartest. I have a temper and not much patience, but when I start to feel bad about myself because, say, a girl turned me down, I have to remember that I'm a badass.

Being a badass isn't something people can take from you, it's not exactly a point they can argue either. So, please, next time someone calls you a stupid tranny,or an abomination, or just plain ugly as heck, remember that damnit, what the fuck did they do huh? I don't see them screwing the rules and making massive strides to improve themselves. No one can deny that it takes, or for some of us, removes balls to do what we do every day.

1376000779.0,55,self.asktransgender,1jzjwu,Sexuality is who you want to go to bed with and gender identity is who you want to go to bed as,leah_81,61,6,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1jzjwu/sexuality_is_who_you_want_to_go_to_bed_with_and/,"I have seen this quote numerous places around in the web and figured I should ask all you wise people about how you feel about it. 

Basically, do you find this to be true? At the end of the day, should this be all I should be worried about when questioning my identity?

.....

Reason why I am asking this is that I have struggled for some time coming to terms with who I am, always finding reasons for why I should or shouldn't transition. I am constantly shifting between feeling like I am ""probably transsexual"" and thinking I am just a femme gay transvestite with a fetish. Sometimes feeling very strongly I should have a female body, and other days feeling content without. And I feel like what I used to have under control as a fetish is now something much deeper and more serious. (I am 32yrs) 

I kind of wish it was this simple as that question, since then I guess I would see no other choice but to accept being transsexual and at least have some sort of resolve. This constant questioning and insecurity about who I am is really exhausting. :S

I have made a list of pro/contra, please tell me what you think.

Reasons why am a man:

* My body language is mostly male and doesn't feel like an act 
* I like my physical strength
* I like to be able to pee standing up
* I haven't always had problems with the looks of my body
* I have mostly male friends
* I have previously enjoyed being a gay man
* I have sexually been aroused by crossdressing
* I dance like a man when drunk
* when I see someone driving slowly in the traffic, I automatically think ""it has to be a woman"",
like I am not like them. (sorry for being sexist...)
* I sometimes think I look like a handsome guy in the mirror
* I think I more want to be a woman, than that I am a woman
* I can see my self growing old as a gay man
* I find it hard to visualize being an old woman
* Continue being a man seems simpler in the short run than to transition
* I could try being a more feminine man than I am today, before doing anything else.
Some, few, gay men think of themselves as the ""female"" in the relationship, and that might be enough.

Reasons why I am mtf:

* When I look in the mirror I want to see myself having a female body with 
 feminine curves, breasts and a vagina.
* In my sexual fantasies I have a female body
* I have no use for my penis and find it incredible that I have been equipped with one
* I have crossdressed in secret all my life
* When alone and frustrated I tend to focus on my genitals, tucking/pulling and trying to minimize them.
* I used to wish I could be a girl in my teens and seriously considered being transsexual. But
 it was too much too cope with and I settled for gay, which worked for some time. Until now...
* I wish I could wear the clothes I want to, without making a scene. Female shorts,skirts, bikinis,
 jeans, dresses and so on.
* I sometimes feel like male clothes don't fit right. Like they are to big, I want them more fit.
* I enjoy wearing makeup
* I have always hated all of my body hair and would prefer to have none
* I am obsessed with reading about transstuff, constantly comparing how my life is
  to others in the same situation.
* When reading about others, a part of me wants to be convinced that I am also transsexual.  
* I think about being trans every day, in the morning, at work, after work, in the evening.
* I feel good and honest when thinking I am transsexual. Both relieved and excited.  
* If I could, I would have pressed the red button to magically transform into a cis-woman
* Alone on an island I would have tryed hrt and dressed as a woman. 
 
 Pfew... Sorry for the wall of text. This was kind of therapeutic for me to put down anyway.

However I didn't take them seriously because they've been saying that for months now. I always told my mom and sister if either of them ever did that to me. That without a doubt I'll cut their hair and shave one of their eyebrows off as well. Last night my mom actually took scissors and cut a huge chunk of hair off the said of my head. I got into a huge fight with them and crying. She told me I was over reacting and need to get over it, it's just hair anyways. 

I pretty much locked myself in my room all day crying and won't speak to either of them. It took me soo long to grow my hair out as long as I have and now it looks like crap because there is a huge chunk missing on the side of my head. I haven't cut the rest yet. I don't know what to do.

I might just have to cut it like they want and just start regrowing it out again, as much as I don't want to. I'm just gonna to find a place and move out.

But gender does freaking matter, and that's why breast cancer, even with a good prognosis, is DEVASTATING. That's why when a man gets testicular cancer he's distraught. Testicular cancer has like a cure rate of 98% or something.

Gender only matters if there is a incongruence between your body bits and your mind! Cis-people demonstrate this all the time. Otherwise why would breast reconstructions after cancer get funded in my country, and why else would men want to get fake testicles put back in after cancer?

So I get pissed off when funding for a transman to get a mastectomy is denied since its ""cosmetic"". I get pissed off when transwomen are laughed at because they want hormones to make their bodies more feminine by people in the medical profession because they can't understand how terrible it is to not have a body that matches your mind.

Thanks for all your kind words and encouragement. I went to the doctor JazzieLiz recommended. I had to go through two extremely embarrassing exams, one external, one internal and scoped. 

After all that drama and emotion, what did he find was wrong? 

Absolutely nothing.

He had to move the scope a bit back and forth to get it to insert, the passageway was a little crooked, presumably from tucking, but he had zero trouble. He did a full visual of the insides all the way up to the bladder and found nothing wrong. No blockages. No scar tissue. Absolutely perfectly healthy. 

As far as we can tell, the nurse, urologist, or whoever it was who tried to insert the catheter in Buenos Aires just fucked up. They screwed up somehow and I ended up with an injury that took awhile to heal. Thankfully at least it seems this left no permanent damage. Whatever they did has completely healed. 

So that's it. I'll be out a few hundred for some medical fees, but it was all really just a big false alarm. The doc is going to write me up a clean bill of health, and I'll forward that along to Chettawut. :)

Again, thanks for the help and kind words! A special thanks for the awesome referral. Dr. McClung is great. The doc was very kind, very professional, and had had several trans patients before.

It’s funny that it took me so long but it’s like they say, “you can’t out someone to themselves” (even if they’re practically gorging themselves on trans* topics and forums and research like a ravenous pig).  It hit me yesterday like a brick.  Just all of a sudden.  It was like in Orlando by Virginia Woolf, when she is on the ship back to England and yells, “PRAISE GOD, I’M A WOMAN” at the top of her lungs.  

All it took to finally break through the wall of repression was dressing like a woman for 12+ hours this weekend.  I secretly borrowed a weeks’ worth of my girlfriend’s clothes while she’s out of the country (for another week or so) and I locked myself in my room and put them on.  There were little flare-ups of sexual excitement but after about an hour the clothes just felt right.  But that’s not when I realized I was trans*.  

I realized I was trans* when I took them off.  

When I took off the bra and went back to boy mode, I could still feel the weight of the bra (and the socks I had stuffed them with).  It was like phantom limb, when amputees can feel their limbs moving even after their leg/arm/finger is just a stump.  It’s the first physical symptom of dysphoria I’ve ever felt.  Like I said, it’s just like phantom limb, but instead of missing a limb I’ve lost, I’m yearning for the body I never had.  That’s when I realized that this isn’t sexual anymore; that’s when I realized that these are what clothes are meant to feel like. 

That’s when I realized: I’m trans*, I’m a lesbian (woahhhh blows my mind), and there is nothing anyone can say or do to change that.  Ever.  Including me. Believe me, I tried for 21 years and that voice just got dealt the killing blow.

And the hilarious part about all of this?  I’m happier than I’ve ever been because I’ve figured out why I’m here on this world: I’m going to be one of the world’s first lesbian trans* superheroes. 

People are killing themselves every single day.  I saw a [statistic](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/staggering_rate_of_attempted_suicides_by_transgenders_highlights_injustices/) recently that said 40% of trans* people have attempted suicide.  Excuse my language, but FUCK THAT.  

All of us who are out and proud, intelligent, articulate, and ready to fight are paving the way for anyone is scared to be who they are.  No one is going to die on my watch.  I’m here to soak up the hate so that others don’t have to.  Because I can take it. 

Sure, I’m probably going to lose my girlfriend and some friends (AND OH GOD MY JUDGMENTAL CONSERVATIVE AUNT), but there are always other friends and girlfriends.  And I never liked that one aunt anyway. Besides, never underestimate love and friendship.  You never know just how amazing people’s reactions will be.  

Oh yeah, and no superhero is complete without an awesome alliance of superpeople, so feel free to join me.  We’re going to let the hate bounce off like bullets.

And the best part?  We won’t even have to take it for very long.  If we’re lucky, by the time our children (HOLY SHIT I GET TO BE ONE OF MY KIDS’ TWO MOMS THAT’S AWESOME.) 

Ahem.  Sorry.  Like I was saying, if we’re lucky we’ll soak up the hate for a generation, harmlessly squeezing it out like a sponge.

Until it finally dries up like an old well: shriveled and forgotten.

I’m readthekeats.  I’m trans* and proud.  I’m one of the first lesbian trans* superheroes.  

And I’m here to save the world.

I've found that the key is making it sound like you just really don't give a fuck at all and it's not a big deal, and that you have no issues with it (and they shouldn't either).

I tell anywhere between 1-3 dates.  I wait until we're having a really good conversation and really vibing, and then if there's a lull all of a sudden I'll throw in a ""by the way..."" or ""FYI...""  I try not to make it sound especially formal or concerning.  I never say ""I need to talk to you about something"" or ""there's something you should know"" or something similar.

Then I'll just say it without any hesitation and with a very nonchalant voice: ""By the way, now's probably a good time to let you know I'm transgendered...it's not really something I think about that much these days, it doesn't really play a huge role in my life, and honestly it shouldn't change anything about our relationship, I just like for my partners to know sooner than later'""  That's pretty much it.  Even if it DOES play a huge role in your life (it really doesn't for me), just say that it doesn't for now so that she understands that she hasn't signed up to be with some guy who is going to be obsessed with it all the time.  You can reveal how important activism is to you later in the relationship.

Also, avoid saying anything like ""I understand if you don't wanna continue seeing each other"" or something like that.  She's perfectly aware that's an option, but she doesn't need to know that you think it's a viable option as well.  It just sounds like low self-esteem.  Also, I personally avoid saying something like ""I can answer any questions you have"" or something like that...you maybe could say this, but for me it sounds too much like a ""let's talk about this a lot"" type thing, and the attitude you're trying to convey is that you just don't care. everything's going to stay the same.  She'll ask questions eventually if she has them.

Really, the key is just to sound as nonchalant and IDGAF as possible, so that they don't start to think they've signed up for someone who's still in the midst of their transition and struggling with all that entails.  

Edit: I also want to add that (while I have never had this happen) if I did get rejected for being trans, I absolutely WOULD get mad.  Not in an asshole way, where I start calling her names, but in a very aloof manner, such as ""I see.  Honestly, I think that's pretty messed up.  It's your decision and I have no desire to be with you now, knowing that this is how you're reacting, but I think it's really strange that you're so caught up in such a minor physical detail.""  The point of this is not to convince her to stay or something--that ship has sailed.  It's to reaffirm YOUR self-esteem and put you in control.  If you act mournful and tell her you totally understand, that you've just been glad to get to know her, etc.,  then you will leave the experience feeling like shit.

So I went to an interview 2 weeks ago, and went there as ""Kasandra"", full feme and everything went great, I got the job and got to start the following monday. I told my interviewer (and now my boss) about me being trans and he said ""I don't care what you do or are, as long as you show up for work and do your job I'm happy"" and ""You'll start here as a girl, so no need to telle anyone else about you if you don't want to"".

So I started last Monday as Kas, and presenting girl, and have now been working for almost 2 week, everyone at work says ""she"" and ""her"" and everything, and I've not told anyone about my ""story"" and still havn't gotten any questions or ANYTHING about ""what I am"".

(This post is long and hard)",tossaway_FTM,54,6,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/ncq1p/sex_there_do_i_have_your_attention_this_post_is/,"Well it’s probably a bad idea for me to be writing this right now because it’s finals week and in the words of Anya: “These things are real, they’re dangerous, and they’re coming.”  

But I wanted to share this kind of bizarre experience I had that was very outside my comfort zone but ended up being really rewarding in a strange way.  

I’m not an outgoing guy as far as romance goes. I started transition when I was 18 and I’m nearly 25 now and the last time I had sex it was before I was even out yet, so you do the math. I think part of my gender identity disorder manifests in that I don’t see myself as sexy, or as a sexual being. My mental age in that category is stuck at 16—I just don’t ever feel like I’m ready to share my body with anyone else. It’s private, and it’s not exactly a place of happiness for me. My body has been my main source of unhappiness for all my life, how can I feel comfortable letting other people see it?

And now, many years on T later and years out of top surgery (the number of people who have seen my post-op chest, I can count on one hand), I still can’t help the feeling that my body is gross, unsexy, how could anyone find me attractive, just no. I can barely look at myself below the belt, why should anyone else want to conduct business anywhere in that vicinity?  

But recently I’ve been horny, ok? So shoot me. I think I passed the many sexless years with grace and dignity, and now I wanted to just get some. And I wanted a man, a biological, cisgender man.  

I should add that I’ve never been with a cis-man before. I had never touched a dick or even seen one that close up, let alone let anyone fuck me. The last time someone put something up there, I was on my gyno’s table and it was hot, let me tell you. (That’s a joke, BTW. It was extremely traumatic and I immediately had a panic attack.)  

Anyway, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I wanted to know, to absolutely *know*, what I’m missing. I wanted a man to lay in my bed, take his god damn clothes off, and let me touch him just about everywhere. And I didn’t want him to touch me, because I’m sexless and unattractive and no one wants to be with me because gross. I just wanted him to be my human model so I could get a look at what I don’t have and never will have.  

This semester I “studied abroad,” but actually I just went to my state capitol city for four months and worked an internship. I got a four-month lease on a student apartment so I had a perfect place to experiment on any possible male trysts. So I was just missing a dude with a dick who would let me touch him and possibly put his dick in my mouth. Hey, I said I was curious. So sue me.  

So I went to the same place you always go when you need something strange: THE INTERNET. And it took a few weeks, but eventually a guy did message me. And I swear, he was *perfect*. 33 years old, attractive, interested in trans guys (it’s possible he was a chaser but I really don’t care because I was essentially “chasing” him too), and he told me two key things during messaging before meeting him:  

1.	He would do as much or as little as I wanted and he wouldn’t push or hassle me about it.
2.	He would lay back and let me explore his body.  

Fucking perfect, right?? That’s what I’m saying!  

So long story short, at the beginning of the semester he came over and let me do what I wanted to him, and I did what I wanted. And he even got me to take my shirt off. I had completely forgotten how nice it was to have someone touch my skin like that. So even though I was nervous about it, he made me feel really good about it. He *liked* my chest, and he liked what I was doing to him.  

For the record, it turns out I give *great* blowjobs.  

He left after he came, I never let him touch me anywhere below my belt but I told him if he wanted to do it again some time then he was welcome to come back. I told him when I was leaving town and he said OK. In the morning I texted him “Hey thanks for letting me blow you” essentially, he said, “Nah bro thank YOU,” and that was that for a few weeks.  

About two weeks ago he texted me again, he wanted to come over and this time he wanted to “go further.” I freaked out for a few days, finally texted him back saying, essentially, “Sounds scary but let’s do it.”  

I threw caution to the wind. I was very scared to let him see me, and possibly even fuck me, but the thing is that he was a really sweet guy and I knew he would stop if I felt uncomfortable, and the even bigger thing is that I knew, I just *knew*, that I would regret it if I didn’t take this opportunity. So I decided to just do it.  

Well, he came over last night and I let him do whatever the fuck he wanted to do, and it was great, okay? Just great. I didn’t have an orgasm but that’s ok because even on the best of days it’s hard for me to come, let alone with this relative stranger conducting business near my junk. It still felt fucking awesome and I was still really glad I did it.  

But I think the best thing I got out of this whole experience is that, yes, there are people who are going to be attracted to me, and they can be nice people! They can be cool people and people with interests similar to mine. I don’t have to be alone forever, as long as I take a little extra effort to put myself out there and meet people.  

So here’s my advice to struggling trans people out there in the lonely stealth world: *Do one thing that scares you every day.* Just do one thing that puts you outside of your comfort zone even just a little bit, and you will find that your zone is expanding faster than you could ever have imagined it would.  

Thanks for reading, if you read it. I know it’s a lot but I just had to get it out there.

Hearing or seeing two friends talking is heartbreaking for me, I just wish I had a close and small group of best friends I could count on for everything.

Being trapped in a teenager guy's body is horrible ( I know you probably heard this a lot) and I hate it. Sometimes I just forget that I am a 6ft man, not a woman (like when this creep was poking me at the bus once) and it just hurts to be seeing and treated as a man by everyone.

I think my face looks sorta feminine. Not perfect or pretty, its pretty asymmetrical(at least in my mind) and my features are not delicate, except for my jaw. It is a nightmare to look myself in a mirror and see this guy.

But I do wonder if I'll ever feel like a woman. Sometimes I think ""I should accept that I am never going to be a woman"". I mean, no matter how much I do to transition, deep inside I will remember of my years as a man. I will never be able to be a biological mother as I dream, I will always have to tell future boyfriends about my past, and I will never know what it is to grow up as a girl.

Not only that, but then there is all the prejudice out there. Not only out there, but in my family and relatives. I am sure I will be the worst-hidden joke of the whole family.

But the point is, if I ever gather the strength to transition, will I be able to keep my past from most of the people? I have a dream that after transitioning I will move to a different country to start fresh, I will get a job and develop a close group of friends. I will tell them about it, and also guys before starting a relationship.

But I dont want the world to know I am transgender. I dont want to walk around with ""trans girl"" written on my forehead.

I dont even know if this post made sense. I just am so sad and broken that I needed to write it out. Sorry for my nonsense rant.

Given that trans folk have some of the worst experiences with judgement and discrimination by the outside world of any group, do we really need to face that inside as well?  Why does this happen?

Went to a doctor today and got a script for 
Estradiol 2mg
Medroxyprogesterone 5mg
Is this a normal prescription? I have no idea.

That's the positive event. The whole time the doctor made me feel like shit, saying I'll never look like an attractive woman, there's lots of health risks, that being ftm is easy and mtf isnt going to work well, that he has two ftm patients who look amazing, that he just saw a mtf patient who looked ridiculous. I don't present as female, but kept calling me sir with a fucking smirk. Just... Ugh. Hurt. A lot.

My sister has told my fiancé that she still ""doesn't get it"" my mom and I haven't talked much about me. All in all, I feel like I'm just a big joke to everyone. Like my feelings and thoughts are all just some fucking phase, and that I don't really want to take a sharp turn at 80 mph.

I hate this. I just wish I was born happy. That I don't have to go through this. That I'm worth something to my family, or hell worth something to myself. All I want is to NOT be a punch line. To live my life under everyone's radar, work a job I can stand, and transition happily. I don't care if I'm a fat girl, an ugly girl, a stupid girl... I just want to be a girl. I just want to wake up and have everyone treat me with the amount of respect I treat them, even if I know their deepest secrets.

Well tomorrow I start estrogen. Most likely will be injecting some amount of Delestrogen or equivalent based on what my Dr talked about last time. 

I've already been on Spiro for 3 weeks and I've felt effects from that. One of the effects I'm pinning on it is my new extreme ambivalence towards this whole transitioning thing. I'm by no means the first trans woman or man to feel doubts over this and knowing all the stories out there about people who delayed transitioning only to do it later in life have pointed me to actually doing this thing, well starting estrogen that is, other transition milestones will happen or they won't but I don't decide that today or tomorrow. 

I've thanked all you wonderful people in the past, and I'll thank you again, without this community I would be 100x more a mess than I currently am. I've developed friendships with a lot of you and hope to develop more as I continue on this journey. 

My wife has even started reading these subreddits and started posting. That's a big change from in the beginning when I was literally panicking 24/7 over her leaving me because of me being trans.

Sometimes I don't know if even _I_ understand me, but I'm pretty sure about this. Let me back up a bit.

Okay, so it's like this... I don't think that gender stereotypes should influence my gender, or, my desire to change my body. That is, I'm interested in transitioning more because it would make my life easier than because I think I should've been born a different sex -- female, to be totally forthright. I mean, I do think that I'd be happier as a biological female, but not for the same reasons I want to transition... I think I need to start over again.

It's like, when I tell her (my therapist) that I want to transition, and she thinks I want to wear women's clothing and flounce around in lacy things and grow my hair and paint my nails, when what I really want is to just be myself, and that doesn't include any of those things, then I feel wrong. Tense. For me, transitioning is a way to align my body with my mind, and that's another part of the issue. It has nothing to do with a desire to fit into society's expectations of gender -- I'm doing this not to fit in, but to simply fit.

So, she's a bit confused when I'm sitting across from her in jeans and a fitted shirt under an oversized hoodie and a plain bandana, all in black, confirming that I'm not wanting to ever slink into a dress, and explaining my need for an endocrinologist. It's not a feminine ensemble, but not a masculine one, either. It simply is. Like me.

See, I identify as gender neutral; neither female nor male. Hence, this masculine body I have feels... wrong. It's built for a stronger person. A manly one, I suppose. And so starting a hormone regimen, and eventually surgery, is the only plan left... or I'm dead. I mean, I don't think it would help to go into my issues with suicide and depression... it might be easier to just say that changing my body is the last thing I'll try to become a bit happier. I don't expect to suddenly be smiles and laughter. I just want to be able to sleep and not hate myself. After trying for my whole life to accept that I own a male body, I think it's time to try another approach and fix it. So I will.

Anyway, my question is this: Am I alone in not wanting to change genders, but change my body? That is, not wanting to become a woman in gender, with all of the expected changes, but just be me, more womanly, neutral in form, a ghost with a different shell? This isn't an easy thing to describe; I'm better at rephrasing existing words than forming new ones.

Hey everyone.  Had a bit of a situation with a bouncer at a club here in canada.  Just wanted to hear from some people that have been in similar situations and if you did anything about it.
I go to this club all the time, it's a really open and welcoming place so I go out in full rave gear everytime.  This time I was stopped for a pat down and the bouncer points to my breast forms and asks me 'whats in there?'.  Not sure what to say I said 'what?' to which he replied 'I know your a dude, dude, I have to pat those down'.  I leaned in and covered my breasts and told him I am trans and he can't do that.  He told me to put my arms out to finish the pat down.  He then roughly grabbed my forms, I feared so hard he may have popped one (thankfully they were fine).  I pulled his hands away and walked past him.  
I informed the lady at the ticket booth that the bouncer had laid his hands on me and she became very serious.  Asked if I was ok and if I wanted a manager to come speak to me.  Kind of in shock I declined and said I was alright, saying to her to just pass the message on.  I couldn't stop thinking about it at the event though and it took all my strength to keep a smile on my face for my friends.  
Today it's still bothering me.  Im planning on giving the place a call tonight to speak with someone.  
Anyone had the same experience?  what did you do?

EDIT:  Thanks for the love everyone &lt;3  I'm glad to hear I'm justified in being upset.  I've never had anything like that happen, I know things could have been worse but I can't sit still over it.  Unfortunately my phone isnt working today so I'm not going to be able to make the call today, but I'm going to find a way to connect with someone tomorrow once it's sorted.  I'll keep you all updated.  Thanks everyone!  


UPDATE!!  I heard back from the club via email this evening.  To say the least I am blown away and I am feeling MUCH better.  Its an interesting situation.  I have been made aware that the club actually used to be a lgbt club before it became what it is today.  The managers have remained the same and one is actually a drag queen &lt;3  They have asked me to provide more details on the event, all of which will be brought up in a staff meeting that was planned for this week.  They are sympathetic to the transgender community and wish to make sure that I, and others, feel welcome in the future.

It's because she validates me.

She makes me feel like the woman I know I am, even though I still present male and am afraid to start estrogen.  Even when I get Mister'ed by the nurses.  Even though I'm still being called ""he,"" because despite truly wanting it... I'm terrified of ""she.""

And I have no idea how she does it.  No clue.  Not an inkling.  

Maybe it's the eye contact; her tone.  Or the way she puts her hand on my shoulder, making clear she cares.  Or how she listens, truly listens, like a second therapist, to every fear and doubt I have.  Or how she, with the wave of a hand and a few quick words, can dispel all those fears and build me up whole again.

As a lover of games, and as a dev, I was excited to finally be able to go to one. Unfortunately, events from today make me never want to go again. Ever.

It started out great though. On Friday there was a panel about transgender issues in gaming which was really nice, and afterwards the panelists were kind enough to stick around and talk to folks. It was a pleasant and incredibly comfortable atmosphere, something to which I've only recently been privy to.

Something happened today, however, which is easily the worst experience I've had since I started transitioning. I was trying out a demo of a new multiplayer game (I won't say which one), when during the course of gameplay someone on my team turned to me and asked in a loud voice: ""Hey, so why are there so many of you trannies here? It's kind of weird.""

The sad part is that his comment wasn't even the worst part to me. There will always be giant assholes with misguided views; I've come to expect them. I do (or maybe did) think that the majority of people are at least decent.

What really got to me was that not one of the 15+ people around us, not even the guy working the booth who was supervising us, said or did a single thing. No one even did as much as shoot him a weird look for being so awkwardly aggressive. Not a single person! They all glanced at me briefly with a look of curiosity on their faces, as though they were thinking, ""hey yeah why *are* there so many trannies here?"" Then they went back to watching and commenting on the game, or talking amongst themselves.

That such a terrible, transphobic statement could be practically shouted and not even register as offensive on so many people's radars, was overwhelming. 

I have never in my life felt so vulnerable and scared, nor disappointed in a group of people with which I associated. It's affected me so deeply that I'm even considering re-closeting myself (is that even a term?) outside of work.

EDIT: Thanks everybody for weighing in on this! I'm definitely going to drop a word to PA regarding this. I figure they'd want to know that these sorts of things happened.


DOUBLE EDIT!: Ok, so it's become clear that some people have missed something which I thought was abundantly clear in my original post. I shall put it in all caps, hopefully to remove all doubt. Ready? Here it is!

IT WAS NOT THE COMMENT ITSELF WHICH BOTHERED ME SO MUCH. IT IS BY FAR NOT THE WORST THING EVER TO HAVE BEEN SAID TO ME NOR WILL IT BE.

It was the fact that I was surrounded by people who heard and tuned into the situation neither recognized nor understood that it was a wrong thing to say. Now why did that bother me so? It was a disturbing illustration about how widespread ignorance regarding transgender issues still is. While yes, that education about such topics is lacking is old news, it's always unsettling to experience its effects firsthand, to witness a bunch of otherwise good people not react to something bad simply *because they just don't know it's bad*. 

Do I think it's worth E-mailing Penny Arcade about? Yeah, why not? I'm sure they'd like feedback of all kinds regarding an event they set up. I already dropped them a line discussing the incident. Am I going to demand anti-jerk screenings at all their events? No. I think that would be kind of silly to try. 

Honestly, the incident has already fallen by the wayside in my mind; it's not worth dwelling on. In the moment, it was scary and unpleasant. It was also probably unwise for me to post about it with a ton of negative emotions coloring what I said. Really, the reason I found the scenario to be noteworthy was that until now, I've only experienced ignorance of trans issues first-hand in the form of a single buttwad saying offensive things, never the inaction of a large group, which to me is scarier and more indicative of the underlying problem.

We need to be prepared to stand up for ourselves and defend ourselves against groups that attack us, whether it be crazy right-wing christians or radical lesbian feminist seperatists. If you don't know how defend your position, do research! Learn! It's a valuable tool and could save you a lot of heartache. With that being said, I leave you an example story, something that happened to me just 30 minutes ago:

The Jehovah's Witnesses knocked on my door and said ""Ma'am, we just want to tell you about the love of Christ."" I heard them out for a bit and finally responded with ""Oh but you won't want me!"" To which they laughed and responded ""Sure we do!"" At which point I said well, you see, I'm a male to female transsexual currently in a romantic relationship with a man. I also live with a lesbian and we are very active in the queer community. Watchtower beliefs teach that homosexuals should abstain from having sexual desire and performing acts with those of the same sex, and your church also teaches that transsexuals are essentially the same as homosexuals, therefore invalidating my identity and marginalizing my internal struggles. Furthermore I love my country, proudly exercise my right to vote, would happily give blood if I met the exclusion criteria, and can't wait to celebrate Christmas. Finally I believe that the Watchtower organization as a whole, either by intention or by neglectful behavior, exists as a psychological control mechanism used to condition it's followers and discourage critical thinking or insightful analysis of one's core beliefs."" I swear I've never seen someone squirm as much as he did, and then he walked almost as though sprinting. Beautiful.

**TL;DR: Don't be afraid to stick up for yourself, and know how to defend yourself in a debate. You WILL have to do it more than once during transition.**

This must be what tears of joy feel like. Literally cannot stop crying. I thought it was just me.

Judging by what I’ve read so far, this seems like a safe, welcoming place where I can finally share what’s been on my mind. So, here’s my deal. This is what I’ve been feeling. 

For so much of my life I’ve been horribly depressed and could never pinpoint a specific reason. I was just sad and slow. Even when I was very young I remember feeling burdened by an invisible force crushing me with the sads. All my life I’ve felt like a space alien and have never been able to figure out why life doesn’t work for me like it seems to work for everyone else. I figured this was just how life was and would forever be for me. A miserable observer always looking in from the outside. I never participated in things because I felt so awkward and out of place. Things just didn’t make sense. Still don’t, really, but they’re beginning to.

I come from a small, loving family who have supported me in all things. I got a good education. I have friends. I’m young. I’m healthy. I’m working. And people sometimes say I’m attractive, I guess. Everything looks fine on the surface. I shouldn’t feel so depressed and detached all the time, but I still can’t shake this feeling of being uncomfortable in every situation. I’m uncomfortable in my skin. 

The problem is, no one really knows me. Everyone thinks they do, but I’m very selective with the things I share with people. I’m a very private person. It always comes as a surprise to people when I tell them how unhappy I am. Even my family, when I told them I’m on antidepressants they said, “No, you can’t be depressed. You always seem so happy!” 

I guess I’m better at pretending than I thought. 

There’s another act I’m good at playing, too, apparently. There’s a big part of me I’ve had to keep hidden, and there are things I’ve never told to anyone. I’m just naturally sort of private and secretive. It’s just a thing. But what got me to finally do some real soul-searching was, I had sort of a meltdown a few months ago. I was drinking a lot at the time, and one night I sort of lost it. I won’t get into details, but it opened my eyes to the fact that I might have a problem. The next day I went to the doctor. Got on meds. Stopped drinking. Started thinking. Some days I feel better, but mostly still feel generally flat, stagnant, bored, and sometimes pointless. I feel like a ghost. Something’s misfiring in my brain and has been for ages. I’m 23 now and don’t have much to look back on, and what’s worse, anything to look forward to. I feel like my life has sort of run its course.

Anyway, in my months of (mostly) sober reflection, digging through old family photo albums and home videos relentlessly searching for an answer, some piece of definitive evidence, I’ve noticed two constants in my life which run as far back as I can remember: I’ve always been prone to depression, And imagining myself as a girl makes me less depressed. It just puts me at ease and feels right. Sometimes I look in the mirror and see my mom. All the girls I’ve had crushes on in the past, I didn’t just want to be with them, I also wanted to be them. I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to put together what seems to be an obvious connection, but because of the society we live in, I’ve completely ignored it in the past, passing it off as just a weird quirk I’d bury forever. After seeing a therapist for a few months and having read some of your stories here, I think there’s more to it. And I’m finally getting to the point where I can admit to myself what I’ve never been able to.

I’m a girl.

And I’m scared. Scared to death. Not sure what comes next. Coming out to my parents or anyone for that matter makes me sick to think about. I’m poor so I can’t realistically take any steps closer. I don’t even know where to begin. It all seems so impossible. And what has me most worried is… 

What if I’m wrong?

I know none of you can answer this for me. I’m not asking that so much. That’s a question only I can answer. Just wanted to at least share what’s been on my mind and open up a dialogue with people who have stories similar to mine. I’m tired of being alone. Even when I’m with people, I’m alone. You know what I mean. I know you do.

Anyway, after all that I think it’s time for a cigarette. Thanks so much for reading. Hope to hear from you :)

I posted a lengthy status explaining what I've been going through, who I am, and who I'll be becoming. Later  that night, I changed, I changed my name on there.

It was fantastic. Dozens of people, friends, coworkers, and some older classmates from back in highschool all congratulated me and offered their support. I even had some friends and relatives of friends message me just to say they wanted to congratulate me. I cried like a dozen times yesterday, reading so many of these awesome messages (I really am such a girl now haha).

I just wanted to share that with you all. I don't post here too often, but the community has been an invaluable source of information and support for me over the last year. Maybe someone else who was as scared of going public as I was will feel a little more reassured after reading this.

It all backfired. Big time.

I let her develop a relationship with another man, under the guise of a threesome... though I somehow knew she would fall in love with him. That he would come to make her happy in ways I could not.

Then came the deceit, the lying about not seeing him after our threesome... I picked it straight away, after all, who could be better at hiding things and picking up on than us right?

She felt deceitful, but I told her I knew, and calmed her fears. That maybe its for the best, and she told me she loved him. That hurts, like it would for anyone.

But I believe it was needed. She still cares for me very much, but understands I have my own life, and she wants to create one for herself as well.

We decided on myself having primary custody, but our parenting plan allows her to see him, and have him overnight, or as much as she really wants. It's all completely amicable.

So she went from little 5ft 4, 54kg me to a 6ft 1, 87kg UFC fighter. Well... she got her man haha.

3.how long does it normally take to completely change?(keep in mind she hasn't hit puberty yet Tanner stage 4 I believe)
4. How fun is it to finally get to be a girl?
5. Do you sometimes forget it's ok, and act like a boy at first?
6. Do you pee standing or sitting? If you are playing out side is it still ok to pee on the bushes occasionally after you transition? (She's 9 remember lol)
7. How do you pee in a dress without peeing on the skirt? (I had no idea most of these were about urine sorry.)
8. What was your first sign of puberty?
9. Did people make fun of you? How bad did it hurt, what did you say?
10. Is it mentally hard? (She sd this was the most important question)
11. Does it feel strange right at first, or just awesome?
12. How do you know who to tell you were born with a penis?
13. Do the antigen blockers make the penis shrink?
14. Do people that knew you before look at you funny when they see the real you?
15. Do you loose friends by transitioning?
16.what public potty do you use while transitioning?
17. What are the bad words you have been called? I need to know so I can be prepared, I know it is a hard question, but I need to know, sorry. (Goddamnit I am tearing up)
18. I am happy and excited, but nervous and a little scared too, it sounds silly, but is that normal?
19. How do you hide your peenie (penis) in a girl's bathing suit?
20. How did you choose your female name?
21. Did you lose contact with some family members?
22. If the antigen blockers do make my peenie smaller, does it make it harder to tuck and sit to pee? (Urine is apparently very very important to her)
23. Even though the bad things, and mean things people say, was it worth it?
24. How does it feel to finally be your self?

Never really thought extensively about wanting to be a man.  It popped up now and then - I wanted to be able to *do* the things that boys could do, and *act* the way they did.  I always felt really uncomfortable in feminine clothes and roles - whatever, right, lots of girls are like that.

But with my friend talking about his transition so much, and being brave enough to take the steps to make himself look more like how he wants, I am just stuck on how much I think I would like to have been born male-bodied.  I want the shape, the voice, the muscle-building ability, the dick.  (ESPECIALLY the dick.  Is ""phantom dick"" a thing?)  The feeling comes and goes but with him talking about his injections it's definitely on my mind more often lately.

I dunno.  The trans people I know all ""knew"" from a very young age, they thought about it a lot, it's a big part of them and transitioning was a big goal.  With me, it's ... well, I would LIKE to be a man, but I'm not averse to being a lady.  ACTUALLY transitioning would be so difficult and costly, financially and socially, that I feel like I can live with the feeling, but still...  

Ugh.  I wish I could swap day-to-day.  I can't even try to see what it's like to be seen as a man; I'm a busty/hippy/short woman and my silhouette isn't remotely masculine...

Is there a way to make this feeling go away or to satisfy this feeling...?  Am I too old to be thinking about this JUST NOW?

I think I would like to hear some stories from people who transitioned or only thought about transitioning pretty late, if there are any.  Genderqueer people too.

DOUBLE UPDATE: Talked with the guy who is moving into 2 bedroom house said he is moving in Feb. first and is willing to waive any rent and expenses and help me secure a job. Things are looking up! Right now I really need some bathroom supplies and basic things as I am running out of everything.

They had an ""Intervention"" yesterday which was my mom yelling at me about everything I fucked up in the past, my dad telling me to stop bringing up the past, being choked against a wall then thrown down and being told that he is ""the man of the house"". They told me that if I don't take some medication to deal with these issues I have to move out. Not having an income currently I had to agree. They think that I have issues that made me think that I wanted to be transgender and gay, and that taking anti depressants (that were prescribed to me 2 years ago) will fix everything and make the transgender issues go away.

I've tried giving them informational packets (Their response: I don't believe a word off of the internet), asking for them to go to PFLAG (Their response: It's a social-political organization with a secret agenda), asking to go on hormones (Their response: Fuck no, you're not a girl, etc). Basically anything I have tried they counter with their own hate and ignorance.

I have been very depressed lately because I have no support from my family. I can't interact with them at all because it always turns into an argument, for example my mom was screaming at the top of her lungs because I ate some 2 day old bacon. I am in my room most of the time because it's away from them. I try to hang out with my friends but it turns into ""I don't know where you are or what you're doing"", even though they know I don't drink or party. No matter what answer I give them they counter it with their own, making it pointless for me to give them any feedback.

They bring up little tiny insignificant problems I had in high school that have no connection to the problems I were facing. I only became suicidal and depressed since I came out to them before my senior year (when I was outed by my sister). All of my depression, social problems, self harm and suicidal thoughts only started after I came out, but they completely overlook that and ignore it. I can't do anything to make them understand, it's been 2 years and when I present to them all the information and alternatives I can and they don't take them I can't do anything.

What should I do? I know I need a job but I am in debt and just feel like I'm sinking more and more. I need to get out of this house as soon as I possibly can but I have no family to turn to and only a couple friends.

She was choosing outfits from my wardrobe when I was away for a little while, but she usually asks me to pick them out and I try to present ideas she may not have considered, although she is really very creative. I just wanna be supportive because she must be really scared if it took her this long to tell me.

As it is, it was a bit of a shock when she told me. We have been together for 11 months. Anyway, I am very curious about what to expect in my newly lesbian relationship.

She's making an appointment for the psychological evaluation tomorrow, she has only told some friends so far. Should I go with her to the appointment? My intention is to do so, but if that might make things weird for her I'd rather let her have her space to deal with things as she likes. I feel like she should just tell her family and hope for the best. I know it's easier said than done, and she has a lot of anxiety, but it seems the longer she takes the harder it will be. What have your experiences been with that process? Also, should I introduce her in the feminine when she is dressed feminine? How long are hormone therapies? Are they very awkward? Does the voice change at some point? She's worried about being too old to develop feminine curves, she's 24. I sincerely think the curves will happen. She's already got a very feminine shape, and women grow in the hips and breasts until we're 30 so I figure she can too. Can you tell me whether your experiences confirm this? She is in film, and is working on coming out within the industry. How has it been for all of you at work while transitioning? What is the most awkward period in the process and what can I do to make it easier? If you can think of any advice, whether I asked the question or not I appreciate it.

I hadn't spoken to her or my close family for at least five years.
In january of this year I attempted suicide and somehow my mum heard about it. She called me and we eventually made up.
I told her about me being trans and that I had been living FT for over 2 years. At first she was shocked as I didn't show any signs when I was younger (guess I was a good liar/actor).

She then accepted me and we satrted phoning each other and she decided that she wanted to meet me, this never happened for one reason or another.

So last Monday evening I received a message from my uncle who had found me on facebook asking me to contact him urgently.

I inboxed him my number and then my Aunt called me telling me that my mum had a heart attack a week ago and slowly deteriorated until she passed away Monday evening.

Obviously I fel to the floor in floods of tears and pain, then I became filled with rage at why they didn't inform me a week ago so that I could see her. Now I have been totally excluded from the funderal unless I show up as male o_O.

I'm not allowed to sit in the limo with my other siblings, nor am I allowed to go to her home with the rest of the family after the funeral.
I asked for a lock of her hair or a small amount of her ashes, this was refused me.

I'm filled with so much rage,anger and pain I don't know what to do.

No one has phoned me since the initial call or text me to tell me what is going on. I don't know where she is resting now, they will not tell me the name of the chapel.

I'm absolutely distraught. On top of that I'm divorced and I have the kids staying with me this week ( they are special needs ) and I'm exhausted. My dad who is divorced from my mum since I was 2 years old hasn't given me a hug oir even asked how I am, he normally is very touchy feely and has no problem with expressing his emotions.

I'm so alone and I'm completely fucked up, wat do?


Edit: I've now found out that my mum has 60k Sterling in her bank account. It's been a couple of week since her death now and my sister spoke to me during the first week of her passing and has now gone back to completely ignoring me. My uncle who was sending me messages through facebook has now disabled that feature and I can no longer talk to him. So I have been completely cut off from the family.

So I need some advice. There are 5 siblings including myself. My mum was divorced and there is 60k left in her account. I've got this bad feeling that's why I'm being kept at arms length as they want my inheritance and are deliberately making excuses not to stay in contact. I just can't shake this feeling, it's been bothering me since she died and the more I think about it the more I'm convinced this is why they are doing this, keeping me away so I don't ask questions.",,False,,t5_2r4b9,1353144594.0,,,True,t3_12g9gg,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/12g9gg/so_my_mum_died/,

As [requested](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/kn8c9/why_no_trans_census/), I've put together a little census filled with questions for you. I'm excited to see how diverse and amazing our readership is. Your information is logged completely anonymously and I will tally up and post the results after a week or so.

**EDIT:** The Census is closed! Results will be posted sometime next week.

Please be patient with the results, they might take a little while for me to compile. I've tried my dandiest to be as inclusive as possible, but if there's anything missing, please just use the ""other"" option that's available on most of the questions.
 
Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas and hopefully this will give us a better picture of what our readership looks like. Thanks!

**EDIT:** I'm going to close the census this Wednesday, Sept 28th. Expect at least a week for the results to be compiled and put into a lovely format.

First, I want to thank everyone in the community. You've given me so much strength and confidence the past year and truly helped me develop, both emotionally and personally. I can't recall a single post I've made that received less than 30 likes, and countless supportive comments. Thank you, sincerely, from the bottom of my heart.

That said, I am deleting my account. I will keep it for the moment, but tomorrow it will be gone.

**Don't be discouraged**

As we know, the transgender path is a unique one. It has its downs, and its considerable ups (*which are far more rewarding than words can share*)!

That said...

I had a session with my therapist today. And, from that, I decided to take a break from my journey. We discussed things - many private - that I will not share. And she supports my path to womanhood should I choose it.

But, upon listening and hearing me out, she suggested I take another stab at being *me*. I'm still unsure of what that means, but she could sense I *need* to give it a try.

All of my love and support goes out to the community. You're all wonderfully brave and amazing. I love you all deeply. You've been instrumental in my life.

But I need to rediscover myself. And, if, at long last, that discovery leads to my transition, I will welcome it with open arms. But for the moment, I'm compelled to open my arms (*and heart*) to the opposite.

We all want peace - of body, mind, and spirit. And I want that for you!

So, don't take my departure - however permanent - as an indictment of your own feelings and personal journey. Be true to who you are, whatever the cost.

*That was her advice*.

So, I feel it best to understand what being ""*true*"" to myself actually means - in its purest, most final state - before taking any drastic measures.

Hormones or not. Male or not. I am you, and you are me. And we are stronger for it!

Thank you so much. And please support me, as I support you, in my own journey to find my true self.

My Best,

Jessica &lt;3

...

'What do you mean?'

What I always find so hilarious about my speculative stressing ( my habit of trying to come up with all the answers to a discussion before it happens ) is that I never come remotely close to guessing the actual response. 

I think I sputtered something about knowing for some time that I wasn't 'inherently male', about how I've been happier recently... 

My girlfriend has a history with women, and was very involved in LGBTQ schtuffkins in college (rights groups, classes) -- she responded perfectly calmly,

'Well I'll have to think about that one.'

We sat quietly for a moment while I freaked the fuck out. I said

'Well thanks for not running off crying anyway'

I guess this ... broke the ice -- she laughed and said 

'You know I'm better than that. And you're better than that. It's an adjustment, not a cancellation'

And I smiled.

We spent the rest of the night talking... sometimes crying, more often laughing. Topped it off with some somethin somethin. 

She laughed so hard when I told her about the double rainbows.

I do wear a pride bracepet, though.

So, the short version is that I work overnight security for the D******** Corporation. Apparently, there was a threat against an employee made at some point, so someone hired a separate security group for some reason. There was no notice given to myself or my boss, and they refused to give us actual evidence that they were supposed to be here. As such, I didn't let them in, and I informed my boss ASAP.

 After a lot of inconsiderate bullshit, they finally produced papers. My boss showed up and informed them that all it would have taken was a phone call to sort this out, but they acted like we didn't need to know why they were there, so of course we weren't going to let them inside.

Long story short, their supervisor eventually shows up, and right off, he's incredibly rude. The worst kind of condescending asshole. I can't fathom how this guy works for a professional organization.

They exchange words, my boss leaves, and they're supposed to go home for the night. After a patrol, they let themselves back in. Already, that's off, because the contract says their duties end at 10:30. I ask if I can help them, and they were rude, and mocked me, despite my best attempts to be civil.

They walked around the lot, while I tried in vain to reach my supervisor. They came back towards the front gate and mocked me some more, and then wanted me to let them out.

So I said ""Well, as sorry as I am to see you go, I'll show you the easy way to open it."" and went to open the gate.

The supervisor, a real gem of a scumbag, says ""Well, look at the balls on this one!"" and laughs. I reply ""I don't need them, I'm transgender and they're coming off anyway.""

Then as I explain that any further commentary by them on that is sexual harassment, I open the gate and tell them to get out.

Then they called me a shemale. I heard something about ""Not touching that"" but I was too mad to hear it.

I saw red, but I kept my composure. I closed the gate behind them and told them it was a real pleasure meeting the both of them.

As I was walking back to my station, the supervisor, a guy named ""Bryan"" yells for me, and informs me that everything we had exchanged was recorded, because they use audio and video recorders when they're working.

I told them that it didn't change much, and went back to work.

I called my boss and informed him, and now I'm wondering what to do. All I know is that their whole operation is made up of condescending assholes, and at least two transphobic bigots.

Does anyone have any advice? I'm out at work, despite forced presentations, so this isn't something I need to keep on the down low.

&gt; ""Got the job at ... in-town! Can't wait to start. Don't care if I temporarily lose my social life... Those of you who I am close to should know that I am just trying my hardest to get my own place and get out of here.""

Many, many people in our town support this person in their decision to make this change, and as a community we're up in arms about this and really want to help.

Alright, just a quick post right now. I leave for the airport in just a few hours to travel to my FFS with Dr. DiMaggio. I'll be posting photos and updates on this thread when I can. My flight leaves at 9 PM Central time and arrives 9:30 AM Beunos Aires time. 

Here are my final before pictures. No makeup, just me as I am:

http://imgur.com/a/zJZha#0

830 PM Sunday April 15th: made it through security. Made it to the plane that will take me to BA.
I'll give further updates as things progress.

1 PM Monday, April 16th: arrived safely in Buenos Aires. All set up in the apartment. Was able to sleep a bit during the flight. Not doing much today, just sleeping and recovering from jet lag. The flight went fine. On time, no problems. Got picked up from the airport, met Amanda, Dr. DiMaggio's main patient aid, she's awesome. Here are some shots I took of the apartment, right in the middle of downtown Buenos Aires:

http://imgur.com/a/W93U3#0

2 AM Wednesday, April 18th: about to pass out, a post before sleep. Very busy day. Got up bright and early. Went and got blood drawn. X-rays taken. In the afternoon, met for coffee with another FFS patient, a stand-up comic from New York. After this, went to get my heart checked with a cardiologist. 

Finally met with Dr. DiMaggio in the early evening. We talked a lot about the procedures, decided to pursue full FFS as originally planned. Reviewed my x-rays, got a realistic understanding of what level of feminization is possible with my existing bone structure. DiMaggio strives above all else for a natural-looking result. It may not be as aggressive as would be possible in a perfect world, but he will do as best as humanly possible with my bone structure. Still, what he is doing will shift me permanently into the feminine range. Once this all heals up, I don't envision being able to pass as a guy unless I dropped my pants or summoned up my old deep scary guy voice. :P So dramatic feminization will be possible. 

In terms of the health checks, all is well. I'm only 24. I'm in great health. I'm an excellent candidate for FFS. I should heal quickly. The actual surgery is first thing in the morning on Thursday. It will be a long procedure, maybe 6-8 hours. DiMaggio takes his time, only does 1-2 operations per week. Still, I trust him. He's been doing this for 20 year, originally studied in the US. He's done over 5000 reconstructive surgeries over the years, of which about 750 were trans women like me. He's literally one of the best, most experience doctors on the planet. I'm comfortable putting himself in my hands.

He said I was really nervous and needed to relax. Ordered me to sleep well and get a lot of time out walking around tomorrow. Gave me some Xanax to help me sleep lol. Tomorrow (or I should say later today), I will go and visit some of the tourist hot spots. I'm right in downtown Buenos Aires. The presidential mansion, the Argentinian equivalent of the White house, is literally like 6 blocks away. I'll go walk around there. While there, I'll also go reconnect with my Catholic routes. I'm no where near as active as I used to be, but I was raised Catholic. I'm still spiritual, if not religious. I plan to go visit the 300 year old national cathedral and spend some time praying for my partner back in Houston, the trauma he's going through with the recent passing of his uncle, and for success in my own imminent operation. 

6:20 AM Thursday, April 19th: about to leave for the surgery. Yesterday I walked around the city a bit, including a really old cathedral in the heart of the capitol area. One of those really neat old ornate Catholic cathedrals. Took some neat pictures, will post later. I leave in a few minutes, but so far all is well. See you on the other side.

10:30 AM Friday, April 20th: short update for now. Surgery went well. Feel like I was run over by a truck, but whatever. I'm alive and feeling better by the hour. More updates as more new happens.

9 PM Friday, April 20th: Discharged from hospital. Now head back to apartment to recuperate. Can't be soon enough. Hospital food sucks and you simply can't get a good night sleep in a hospital bed.


11 AM Sunday, April 22nd: this weekend just recovering in the apartment. Will meet with DiMaggio again tomorrow or Tuesday and probably be cleared to leave the apartment. The first night out of the hospital was rough, waking up every three hours. Saturday night was well, got the first good night sleep since Wednesday night. The pain medication is effective. I've been able to remove the plugs from my nose, so now can breathe a bit through there. 

I still have bandages on. In the hospital, you wear a very heavy head wrap, almost like a cast. Out of the hospital you wear just a much lighter compression bandage. There's a bandage covering my forehead wrapping around my head. There's a cast on my nose from the rhinoplasty. The flesh around my eyes is still colored a deep maroon, but the swelling has gone down dramatically. Right after surgery, I couldn't even open my eyes. Now the swelling has gone way, way down. 

My strength is recovering. I barely ate anything in the hospital. Hurt too much to move the jaw. Yesterday I had a nutrition shake, some yogurt, and a banana. Today I made up some macaroni and ate that. I'm slowly getting back o normal food. I brought a whole bunch of soft food with me. I wasn't sure what I would find, and just wanted a lot of ""comfort"" food to have after the surgery. So I brought a lot of box macaroni, spaghettios, peanut butter, etc, just stuff that is easy to make, goes down easy, is nice and soft and very familiar. I love trying new ethnic food, and some of the empanadas I had before surgery were amazing. Still, after surgery, I don't want to try new ethic cuisine. I want familiar and mundane. 

So overall, things are going well. My strength is recovering. Things are healing well. I'm getting more energy every day. Right now I'm just trying to keep busy. Playing minecraft, talking with the boyfriend when I can, watching movies and shows I have on my laptop, and wandering through Argentine tv until I find an English-language movie with Spanish subtitles. 

1:15 PM Sunday, April 22: I finally felt well enough to post these photos:

http://imgur.com/a/VIt8p#0

These are the photos I took Wednesday of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral. I'm certainly not the most religious person in the world, but I would consider myself spiritual. I always liked old ornate cathedrals, and no one builds them like the Spanish. Since I'm literally only a few blocks from this place, I had to go check it out. Maybe not your cup of tea, but if you like classic religious artwork, take a look.

6 PM Wednesday, April 25: The last few days just recovering quietly in teh apartment. On Monday, Amanda removed the bandages from my head and I was able to wash my hair for the first time. I met with Dr. DiMaggio and he removed the nose bridge. So as of Monday I had no more bandages on my face.

The swelling is slowly decreasing. As of Wednesday, I no longer need ice packs. I've slowly been decreasing my pain killer doses as the need decreases. I'm still pretty swollen in the chin and jaw, but around the eyes has gone drown dramatically. There's still a few bands of red around my eyes, but mostly it's yellows instead of reds on my face. Things are healing nicely and so far no real complications. 

Friday, April 27th: met with the doctor again today for a general checkup. All is well, no issues. They removed the stitches from my upper lip. This is good as those were quite annoying. The swelling continues to go down and most of the dark red as gone from around my eyes, just a few thin bands left. There's a fair bit of yellow left, but everything is healing up well. Tonight, 5000 miles from home, I had dinner at Burger King. T_T

9:30 PM, Sunday April 29th: no big news lately. Things just keep healing up. Passing the time watching shows, movies, and playing tons of minecraft. I've watched all the way through Avatar the Last Airbender and am 2/3 done with Deathnote. My mega-build in minecraft is near completion as well. Getting plenty of sleep as well. I have five days left here. My flight leaves at 9 PM on Friday night and I arrive at 7 AM on Saturday morning. I met with Dr. DiMaggio one last time on Friday. He's leaving on some trip, probably for the May 1st holiday, so that's the last I'll see of him. On Wednesday I will meet with one of his associates for a final check over. Make sure everything is healing well. If it's healed up enough, they'll remove the stitches from my scalp. If not, I'll just keep them in for another week or two and have them taken out by my doctor back home. Later in the week, I'll post my first after pictures and also make a post on youtube. 

11:40 PM, Thursday May 3rd: last night in Buenos Aires. Things are healing up well. My eyes still have a lot of red in them, but only a few red marks around the eyes remain. My jaw is still pretty swollen, but it just looks like I have a large jaw. I no longer look like I got in a street fight. :P Yesterday, on Wednesday, I met with a doctor one last time. They removed all of the stitches from my forehead and nose, and probably half of the ones from my mouth. The remaining mouth stitches will slowly dissolve. 

This is my last night in BA. It's been a wild ride. Tomorrow Amanda will take some final after pics, and I'll eventually be able to upload some nice before/after shots. My flight leaves at 9:30 PM on Friday and arrives in my homes city at 6:00 AM local time. Tomorrow I just pack and get ready to go. Buenos Aires is a beautiful city. Someday, I hope to be able to return as a tourist. I haven't been able to do much tourist stuff. Most of the time I've just been camped out in the hotel room chatting with my partner or playing minecraft. This city has centuries of history, art, and culture to explore, and my only regret is that I've been able to see only the tiniest glimpse of it. Someday I shall return when I'm not burdened by a huge medical procedure. 

Finally, tonight I recorded my first post-FFS youtube vid. I'll post some proper after photos soon enough, but for now feel free to check it out. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y5SSp94Dy4&amp;feature=youtu.be


Monday, May 7th: On Friday evening I left Buenos Aires. I got back to Houston early Saturday morning. All is well. I had no problems with customs and slept through most of the long flight. I rested over the weekend and today I'm right back at work. Soon I'll be receiving the before/after photos from Amanda, and I will post those here.

Monday, May 7th 10 PM: [Here](http://imgur.com/a/ARJyt#0) are the before/after photos Amanda sent me. Warning, in some, especially the front, I still look pretty jacked up. The biggest difference can be seen in the forehead and nose. The chin/jaw are swollen up a ton, and as such are actually currently larger now that before surgery. -_- Oh well, the swelling will go down in time. 

With that, I'll end this FFS diary. I may eventually post some photos in the following months, but I don't imagine anyone will be following this thread by then. If y'all have any questions, feel free to message me. I'm happy to answer them.

Thanks!

Killing this account.,,51,7,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/q14sv/no_longer_confused_about_gender_killing_this/,"About a month ago I started seriously questioning my gender identity. I thought I was just a little gender queer, or a feminine guy. I started a long journey of seeking information and introspection. I've come a long way since then. In about a month I have accepted I am a (transsexual) woman and I've already started transitioning. I'm no longer confused about gender, so I'm killing this inappropriately named account.

[I've started a new account. Freya is my chosen name and the Freed part means that I have finally freed the woman that was stuck inside the artificial male prison I had created for her, for me.](http://www.reddit.com/user/Freya-Freed/)

Here is a short timeline of the last month:

* 14 jan - Created this account initially meant as throwaway. Questioning gender identity. 
* 15 jan - I learn about people who consider themselves ""bigender"" or 'dual gender'. I start identifying with the term because it seems to fit.
* 22 Jan - I finally accept that bigender doesn't fit. There no male part of me that isn't artificial. I realize I'm transgender and start wondering about transition.
* 23 Jan - I decide I'm going to transition. I come out to my psychologist and she provides some good support.
* 24 Jan - Came out to my mom. She's very accepting and we discuss whats next.
* 31 Jan - I come out to my father and little brother. I don't tell my sister yet because she's not living with us. Everyone seems accepting.
* 12 feb - I start exercising like mad so I can be as healthy as possible when I start HRT. Hoping it will also give me a nice figure.
* 17 feb - After realizing it's going to take way to long to get doctors to prescribe me hormones I decide to DIY and place a small order for spiro and estrofem.
* 21 feb - I get an appointment for a consultancy with a local laser hair removal place.
* 22 feb - I sign up with a specialized hospital that helps transgenders in the Netherlands. As expected I am informed that I am on a 14 month waiting list. I also finally decide on the name Freya and start identifying online as such. Feels like things are progressing nicely so far. Soon I hope that my body will match how I feel inside.

RIP Gender-confused. 

Signed, FreyaFreed.

In it, they'll find out they have another daughter.",TheAllBeing,48,5,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/ky9by/today_my_parents_are_going_to_read_a_letter_i/,"Later that evening, I'll get a chance to talk to them over the phone. Until then, I look forward to a very anxious day at work. I've Never been more nervous. Any words of encouragement or advance on how to handle the whole coming out situation would mean more than you know. Here's the letter I sent to them:

Dear mom and dad,

I wanted to write you this letter to address some concerns you may have had about me lately and to explain things more clearly. You’ve known for awhile that I’ve had some issues with depression since I was young. I know that, as well as being very hard on me, it has also been hard on you to know that I’ve had to deal with these difficulties in my life. I know that you wish I were happy, and I can’t tell you how much it means to me that you care so much for my well-being and happiness. I want nothing more than to make you proud of me. I feel very supported and am glad to have you as parents; I couldn’t ask for a better father and mother.

I’ve been wanting to write this letter for some time now, and I know that mom in particular has been asking a few questions about me to (sister’s name) and wondering what exactly is going on with me lately. Well, I want to answer those questions myself. To begin with, I’m feeling very happy for the first time since I can really remember. I have finally found a treatment for my depression that actually works, and I must say that it’s wonderful to feel like life is worth living. I know that must sound depressing, that I thought life itself was somewhat meaningless, but that’s what I was feeling. I felt like I was only alive because I happen to not be dead yet. Horrific, I know. I look back at how I was and how I viewed my life, and I am amazed (and frustrated) that I was carrying such a burden. I still may have plenty of struggles, but I’ve shaken off this core feeling of depression and helplessness, and in doing so now believe that my life can be full of happiness and meaning.

It’s the specifics of what has made me feel so much better that I write this letter to you now. I’ve had to build up the courage to tell both of you, and I now feel that I can admit something very personal about me and be honest about myself to you. Believe me when I say that this is something I’ve struggled with. I mean really struggled with. I’ve wanted to deny it for most of my life, but have come to the conclusion that I can’t keep living a lie. Growing up I knew something was off about me, and as the years went by this fact became more and more apparent. After several years of questioning and trying to overcome my denial, I am now confident in saying that I am not a man; I am a woman. I may have been born a male, but I don’t truly identify as one. It feels wrong, and this feeling has caused me great difficultly and confusion for much of my life. I want to live my life as a woman. I see myself as a woman. I tried very hard not to believe that this was true—that I could just be a “normal” person—but as time went on it became clear that I was just fooling myself. I was scared of what it meant to be this way. However, this has been a part of me since I can remember, and embracing it, rather than feeling ashamed of it, has made me feel right with myself. I know now that this is the only way I can live and enjoy my life. This is who I am, and this is who I need to be in order to be happy.

I wanted to write this letter to give you time to think about this so we can talk more clearly about it when I next come home. If you need, I will gladly give you more information on better understanding all of this. I’ve told (sister’s name) already, and she has some resources you may want to look at. It may take some time, but I hope that you can accept me for who I am and love me as a daughter instead of a son. I love you both very, very much, and no matter how you take this news, I will still be thankful for all that you have given and taught me throughout my life.

Love,

(new name)


**Edit 1:** On my break reading all the comments. Thank you so much for the words of support. Makes this shift easier to get through. 

**Edit 2:** I just got off the phone with my parents. They said they fully support me as long as I'm happy. My mom had a couple questions about my name choice and a few little things. She also said it was good to hear me cry a little, because I never used to show any emotion. She then said ""you're my daughter, and I'll always love you,"" and I just couldn't stop crying. I was so happy to hear that. She seemed relatively comfortable with everything.

When I talked to my dad, he reassured me that he just wants me to be happy and made a little small talk, but kept it short. He seemed a bit stunned and spoke calmly throughout the conversation; I think he needs to let it sink in for awhile. I was his only son, and he named me after himself. I imagine it's going to be very hard on him, but it seems like he's trying.

Thank you, everyone, for listening. It really helped me through this. The community here has been a lot of help. Thanks again.

I never really get to talk to other trans people, So I'm kinda curious about how varied people's stories are. :)

As for me: I was born in, And still live in Mabank, Texas. Depression started early and by middle school I could barely get out of bed in the mornings. I wound up going to a private religious school for a few years, But it made things a lot worse. Dropped out of school at 15. I was supposed to be home schooled, But I wasn't.

Wound up sitting around my room on my computer for several years, Never really left it. When I turned 18, I got a bit of money that my grandmother left me, And instead of using it for college, I just used it to fund living expenses. At this time, I started DIY HRT. 

Then a small Hobby shop opened near my home and I started going out more. I'd get into card games and D&amp;D and everything. It gave me an outlet to be a lot more social. About a year or so later, I'd gotten partially passable, But still not full-time, And wandered into the shop again. The owner was having some problems keeping it running, So he offered to sell it to me for about the amount of money I still had. So now I have a job, I'm getting closer to coming out, I've got far more friends than I ever had before, And I'm dating a boy nearby. All in all, I'm pretty happy with life now.

TLDR: I'm a 19 year old business-owning dungeon-mastering Transwoman.

I woke up to some absolutely wonderful news. It's like a punch in the chest. I think it's the worst news I could hear short of someone dying. Everything was going so well. I have SRS scheduled June 15th with Chet. I'm currently putting the finances together. I've been working extra hours at work to save up some vacation time for the trip. I've been doing painful below-the-belt electrolysis for months in preparation for this. Everything is going well. Then this happened. 

I had a question about a potential problem, and I sent Dr. Chet an email. Here is what I asked him:

&gt;I have one medical question regarding SRS you may need to ask the doctor. 

&gt;I had FFS in April 2012. When I had this surgery, they attempted to use a standard catheter. However, there was a problem. When they tried to insert a catheter, it didn't work. They told me the problem was I had a narrow urethra. The catheter caused an internal injury that resulted in painful peeing and urinating various amounts of blood for about 6 weeks after surgery. In the end, they could not get the catheter inserted into the urethra. They had to use a suprapubic catheter, a connection directly from the abdomen into the bladder, rather than through the urethra. 

&gt;Will this be a problem for SRS? I don't know enough about the surgical technique or the exact nature of the problem to say for sure. 

This morning, I found his response in my inbox:

&gt;Dear Ms.Tanya
 
&gt;The narrow urethra which leads to unable inserting the catheter is definitely a problem for SRS.

&gt;1.Risk for inadvertent urethral injury or urethra-vaginal fistula due to the post-inflammatory tissue especially if the catheter cannot be inserted as the guideline during vaginal tunnel dissection.

 
&gt;2.Due to the post-inflammation/injury of urethra, it may induce scar along the plane of vaginal dissection (between the urethra-bladder and the wall of rectum) and result in limitation of neo-vaginal depth (shorten than the average or even no depth).
 
&gt;My recommendation:
&gt;You should consult with urologist to investigate of the competency of urethral lumen (severity of stricture) and also test for the catheterization (at least the size of foley catheter no.14 need to be inserted during SRS).

This is just fucking great. What the hell do I do now? Now I got to find a damn urologist willing to examine a pre-op trans gal's junk. Just fucking great. The one part of my anatomy I hate the most. The part that I've been working tirelessly to have freaking removed! And now I have to have someone poke and prod all over it. God damn it! Where the hell do I even find someone willing to do that?

And what happens if the urologist finds that I just have a narrow urethra and there's nothing to be done about it? Can I just not get SRS at all? Is there any SRS doc that can do the surgery without using a urethral catheter? Or am I just stuck halfway transitioned for the rest of my god-damn life?! I don't know if I could even go on like that. 

Why does this shit have to happen? This was all laid out. It was going to be perfect. My boyfriend and I were gonna go to Chet together. He was gonna be there for me. I was gonna be there for him. I was going to have my SRS, he was going to have his top surgery a week later. It's perfect. Why's this have to happen?

If I wasn't at work right now I would probably be getting drunk. I emailed my doctor, hopefully she can refer me to a urologist to deal with this bullshit. 

FUCK

EDIT: went and saw the urologist JazzieLiz recommended. He was awesome, very trans-friendly, and handled things as best as anyone could. He didn't find anything wrong with a limited external exam. So next Friday I'm going to take a few vicodin and go in for the full internal investigation using the scope.

This is still embarrassing and total bullshit, but at least this is solvable. Thanks everyone for your help yesterday.

But now I'm accidentally stealth and want to keep it that way.",VioletHyena,49,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/16jzw2/i_said_id_never_go_stealth_that_id_stay_visible/,"I've been transitioning since I turned 25 in June of 2011. Not a long span of time, but this June will be 2 years on hormones, and 5 months post name change. My name change is happening this month, in a Florida magistrate of family law. 

I can't wait, simply because I'm tired of pulling out my license and credit/debit cards and seeing my boy name. I'm tired of having to explain myself to cashiers, waitresses, and service providers. 

I've become stealth to a degree. If anyone went through my wallet or phone they might realize what I was, but generally that doesn't happen. 

I'm working now, full time as a woman in IT for a staffing agency, they know me by my girl name, the name I will legally assume later this month. And only because my recruiter was accepting of my situation did this happen. My client doesn't know. 

In a year and a half of hormones, I'm passable, and stealth. I'm not a ravishing beauty like some transgirls are. I'm kinda chubby, but in the right places. So my body looks feminine, curvy. My hair is natural, just flat, and I don't have issues with hairloss. I look in the mirror and I see no markers or signs of my previously masculine form. 

I feel guilt, especially when I see news articles written by or about other transwomen. Because some of them have been transitioning for years longer then I, yet they look no more feminine then the day they started. I've been ridiculed and yelled at by the ""Casual Transvestites"" in the local BDSM community for self medding and ""transitioning too fast."" To where I'm living full time, and they hide behind male privilege when at work or sometimes even at home.

I feel transphobic, and that makes me feel guilty. The same causes of hatred when it came to transphobia no longer hit me like they used to. Especially in the BDSM community I can see a lot of the ""TransWomen"" as less then that, they are not women, but men sometimes attempting to invade a female space. They use terms like Transsexual and Transgender when they are anything but. Then use their own self hatred as fuel to assault women like me who ""Succeeded."" And recently their presence, their failure where I've succeeded has caused animosity in me. Because I was open about my Trans status people now lump me in with these others who do not pass. 

I'm no more allowed in girls only events then them. Right now the only community I'm not stealth in is the BDSM community, and I've slowly left it behind. I no longer feel safe or welcome like I did when I started.  It was like a uncanny valley of sorts with no opposing rise. 

The BDSM community apparently saw me as another one of the slovenly male to female trans girls who wanted someone to feminize them. That was never my goal, but I'm sure that is how they saw me. They accepted me, and fawned over me, told me I was pretty. Then I made the leap from masculine to feminine sometimes scaring even them into realizing I was serious about my desires. I was suddenly a woman to them, but a woman with a penis, and an invader. I became no longer wanted. I noticed people stopped talking to me, they avoided me, they ignored me. I was no longer something they could use. 

Now I'm hiding from it, running from something that used to bring me great enjoyment. Running from what brought me together with my current lover. 

I'm stealth everywhere but the BDSM community, now I'm no a member, so I'm stealth everywhere I go. And I don't want to go back, so I feel guilty. Guilty that I succeeded where others are failing. And guilty that I no longer want to be called Trans, or deal with Trans issues. I feel guilty that I no longer care about my transgender brothers and sisters. 

I feel guilty that I've found a place in this world for myself when others are having issues just getting the medical care they need.

It's my birthday and I actually have a request!

You're getting this message because I consider you a closer friend and have something personal I feel it's time I shared with you. All I ask is that you keep reading.

And when I say personal, I mean personal. It's something I've known for years and have had to deal with for the majority of my life. It is something that is incredibly misunderstood yet very real. It is not a choice and if left unaddressed, only gets worse with time. I have expended a considerable amount of energy and effort to hide it but that is a lonely road and there comes a point where it's just not worth it anymore. Any guesses yet?  

If you like labels, the closest one that would apply is ""transgender"". More specifically, I have a female gender identity or ""sense of self"" wrapped up in a body that doesn't quite match. Take a second to reread that last sentence. Yes, me.

A good first question would be, ""How on earth does someone figure that out!?"" I'll save you the lengthy reply and simply state that it has taken years and it is enough that I know. Most cis-gendered (meaning 'not trans') people can't make sense of it just as I can't know what it feels like to feel comfortable with my assigned-at-birth gender.

Another question I get would be, ""But I thought gender was mostly socialization. How can it be a real thing anyway?"" To this, I'd point you in the direction of Milton Diamond's work on the ""Organization-Activation Theory"". The science behind transsexualism has only really advanced in the last decade but it is now known that one's ""brain sex"", as with physical sex, is codified during prenatal development. As these two events occur at very different times during pregnancy, they are susceptible to variation by both external and genetic factors. Not to belabour the point, gender identity is far more fundamental and immutable than once believed (though most just take it for granted). It is also quite independent from sexual orientation in case you were wondering. If you want a good book on the subject, I found ""True Selves"" by Mildred Brown and Chloe Rounsley to be surprisingly relatable though the science from 1996 is out of date.

Last fall, I requested a leave of absence from my masters program because the gender dysphoria and associated depression became unmanageable. It was around this time that I also came out to my family and closest friends. Over the last 6 months I have been fortunate to find myself surrounded by wonderfully supportive people and have found a level of acceptance beyond that which I could have imagined.

Due to the etiology of transsexualism, it is not amenable to reparative psychological intervention and the only known treatment is to bring the body into alignment with the mind. This is no small feat but for a trans person, there is really no other option if they want to avoid becoming at statistic. To this end, I have begun to take steps towards transition. I would imagine some of you have noticed changes though been unaware of my underlying motivation.

As I look back on my life, I see this dissonance as a thread woven through many chapters. It has coloured my achievements and tempered many experiences. I see this life but as so often happens when merely playing a part, it never quite felt like MY life. It's the strangest experience because at the end of the day, I'm still me and this is largely a body issue. Still, I've grown so used to living with this and come to understand myself in such a profound way that I don't think I'd trade it for anything (though there are days!).

I've chosen to share this with you today because I've finished playing the part. It was an interesting experience but integrity means way too much for me to keep going the way I have been. As more people have come to know me under my new name with the right set of pronouns, slipping back into ""[Boy Name]"" and this facebook account feels increasingly foreign. Transition isn't about jumping out of one box only to jump right into another but rather it's about doing what feels right to be able to live comfortably with myself. I don't do anything impetuously.

I take a risk when I share this so openly but you're worth the risk. Thanks for reading and if you want to stay in touch, you can add me here: [New Facebook URL]  I'll probably close this old account at some point rather than switch it over. There's a lot of history here and sometimes it's nice to just start fresh! 

I'd love to hear back from you and if you have any questions, you know where to find me! Hope you have a wonderful weekend.

One way or another, I think this will be a birthday to remember!

I was nervous, excited, confused, and worried as I made my first post here on asktransgender, hoping to find answers about the feelings I had finally confronted inside of me.  I was greeted with rational advice, encouragement, links, and kindness.

Thank you.

Since that fateful day, my non-throwaway account has faded into obscurity as I came to understand myself for who I am and as I worked through absolute hell to begin my transition.  

One year ago, I came here from the comfort of my prestigious college troubled by a scarcely nameable feeling of incorrectness and impending destruction of all I knew to be true in my life to that point.  I come to you now from the classroom of a far less prestigious college in a place far from my home and all that I had one year ago.  Since that fateful day, I have been taken from college, kicked out of my home, forced to beg food and housing from friends, disowned by my own family members, preached at, told I was evil and wrong and disgusting, etc.  But I have never given up.  Much in thanks to all of you here.  

This is my post of triumph over all odds.

I now have my own apartment, a steady income, a still healthy relationship with my girlfriend (we've now been together for almost 2 and a half years), and my own car.  I've learned just how loving and wonderful my friends are.  I've paid for a year of schooling, and I'm on track to have plenty to pay for the next four.  I've won multiple awards in my field of work.  My mother is coming around to accept me, and my little sisters and brothers love me (I never really had any conflicts with them).

I've also begun HRT.  I went through three psychologists.  One in my first home who helped me explore myself, a second who attempted to stall me and discourage me using theology, and a third who wrote me my letter.  My face for once is beginning to look like me.  I've experienced sex that is enjoyable not just for my significant other (who was the only person I focused on in the past), but also for me.  My boobs are growing.  My skin feels good.  The buzzing in my head is gone.  

While I'm still scared for the future, and while I realize that I've only taken a small step in the great story of my life, I've learned so much about myself this last year.  And...I'm proud of the fact that I was able to take the ashes of the situation my parents made for me after finding out I was trans and turn it into a life worth living.  

So, to wrap it all up,  Thank you all for the support, information, conversation, encouragement, discoveries, etc. that you have given me.  I have had a lot of **very** low moments this last year, and the community here has helped to buoy me through them.  

My only regret is the name of this damn throwaway. Hahahahahaha.

1324605032.0,41,self.asktransgender,nnduv,I have just returned from my first job interview as a woman.,SatanicVegan,42,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/nnduv/i_have_just_returned_from_my_first_job_interview/,"A bit of background: I have only been on HRT for 3 months but I am out at my current job and go by my chosen name rather than my birth name and everyone knows what's up (even if they don't always get my pronouns right). I have also submitted all of the legal paperwork to get my name changed. I just have to wait until February and then I can appear before a judge and I'm good to go. 

A couple of days ago, a close friend (an former coworker) of mine emailed me to let me know that the company he now works for is looking for someone with roughly my skill set. It would be working with 3 other personal friends (all of whom I am out to and very comfortable with). The position is not open yet, he tells me, but should be within the next few months and would I like for him to make sure my resume gets into the right hands?

Of course I say ""yes,"" it sounds like a dream job: a small team of people I know, all of whom I have worked closely with in the past? Yes, please! Since I know they won't actually be hiring for a couple of months, and since my name will be official in a little more than a month, I decide it's best to just go ahead and use my chosen name. That avoids the issue of having the wrong name on my resume, right? And since I've been recommended by someone internally (who, full disclosure, also happens to be the manager of the team I'm applying to), they aren't going to be checking references. So I open my resume, replace my birth name with my soon-to-be-legal-but-not-quite-yet name and send it off.

However! That very night, my friend's boss emails me and asks if I can come in and meet with him in person... this week (ie, today). They're not filling the job yet but they want to do the interview while he's in town.

Oops. I was *not* expecting that!

Ok, like I said, I am out to everyone at my current job so this should be no big deal, right? I'm fairly presentable, I'd guess I pass probably 50 percent of the time, barring close scrutiny. If you spend any one-on-one time with me, you're gonna figure out that I'm trans but I don't ever really try to hide that, anyway.

Still, the idea of an interview with someone who doesn't know me, who might be a little surprised by what they're getting... it's a little intimidating.

Anyway, I went out and bought a nice sweater and some slacks last night, along with a pair of flats (it's business casual) and this afternoon, I went in and did my interview. I am not going to go into boring details about the interview itself: it was pretty run-of-the-mill stuff. At one point he did ask ""if you had a billion dollars, no need to be gainfully employed, what would you do?"" and I had to stifle the urge to say ""get surgery!"" Anyway, I'm sure he knew what was up but he was super polite, got my pronouns right and that was that! I am already employed and although I'm looking to leave my current job I'm also not in any huge rush so the stakes aren't as high as they might be otherwise.

Ugh, I just don't understand why everyone has to be so hateful. Why does everyone seem to think its their business what I do with my life?

All of the terrible and hateful things people have been saying to me combined with relatively unsupportive parents and massive academic obligations has left me so depressed. I don't think I've cried this much in years. I just want to go hide in a corner and cry :(

I know that this may be more of a rhetorical question I'm asking. I kind of just needed a place to vent where I felt safe I guess. I hope everyone can understand.

I've been on HRT for close to 3 months, which has caused massive changes in me, both physically and emotionally. As far as the YMMV thing goes, I am one of the lucky ones.  Emotionally the changes have been more profound and radical than I had ever dreamed, but you've heard that story many times on this reddit already: Life feels like it's in color, I actually have feelings now, I'm full of compassion and empathy and I've become ten times more social etc.  My whole experience so far has been mind-blowing, wonderful, and I honestly feel like I was born 3 months ago. Before hormones I was just a shell.  

But there are growing pains.  I feel so inexperienced and naive, and having feelings is so new to me it can be a little overwhelming at times. I am learning how to live in an emotional world one awkward step at a time, and I often fall and hurt myself.  I wish I had a more experienced woman to guide me.

One feeling I've been trying to cope with has been getting stronger, affecting me at all times of the day.  At times it is too strong and I have to cry to let it out, and then I feel better, but it persists throughout the day like a background hum, growing louder or quieter at times.  It seems tied to one of my physical changes - my skin.  

I'm sure a lot of you have experience with this: One of the first and most dramatic changes has been how soft and sensitive my skin has become (as well as curing a lifelong acne affliction, going from constantly covered in pimples to smooth white has been amazing).  All of my senses have changed to some degree, but my sense of touch has gone through the fucking roof.  Every week I notice my skin is more sensitive than the last, when I thought it could not possibly get any stronger.  It's radical how sensitive I am now - to the feeling of the fabric of my clothing sliding along my arm, how my car's steering wheel feels in my hands, or holding a pillow against my chest, or brushing a friend's hand as I hand him something.  I feel like all these things are sending shockwaves through me, sometimes too strong - like a sensory overload. Yet I continue to become more sensitive each week.  Don't get me wrong  though - I love this more than anything.  I feel like guys have been cheated in one way, although I change my mind when it's cold or I bump into something in a way that I wouldn't have even felt before, and now it hurts (this happens a lot, still adjusting as my body changes).

But something else has happened to my sense of touch that is more important.  It creates powerful feelings inside me in all circumstances.  I'm affected emotionally by the shirt I am wearing (this seems ridiculous to me, but it is true).  Now when I get home I immediately change into something more comfortable - before I couldn't have cared less that my jeans were 2 inches too short.  Holding something against my chest provides a feeling of comfort.  Hugging myself helps me when my emotions are too strong.  Pulling a blanket over myself before I go to sleep - I can't even describe how that feels but sometimes I crawl into bed in the middle of the day without any plans to sleep just to feel that feeling. Curling up or stretching changes the way I feel.  I want to touch and hold and feel everything. Especially other people.

I feel so connected to other people now - I'm so aware of their emotional state and I want to take care of everyone.  A guy at my work today came in obviously in a bad mood (probably had a fight at home with the wife or something), and I really had to argue with myself and fight the urge to pull him outside and ask him if he was okay and did anything happen that he wanted to tell me about and just give him a big hug.  I guess I wanted to ""take care"" of him.  Three months ago other men had like a barrier around them and I never would have dreamed of breaching their personal space or questioning their emotional state. Actually overall men are a lot more intimidating than they used to be.  I feel like they all grew two feet and turned into invincible unfeeling stone golems.

And there is the problem.  I still look like a (quite feminine) guy.  All of my friends are computer guys.  I'm a software engineer who works long hours with a long commute at a high stress startup.  No one in my life wants me to be anywhere near them, physically.  And to be clear: there is not one person in my life right now that I am interested in, sexually or romantically.  

But I desperately want to touch and be touched.  Badly, at all times.  It's hard to ignore - I can push it to the back of my mind most of the time, but it is always there, and it gets so strong sometimes I can't cope and I have to step outside to cry in my car or cry myself to sleep at night (crying does seem to help some).  I've never felt anything like this before and it has persisted for over two months now, overall getting worse. 

The feeling is so strong I feel like I am starving or dying in some way, and it is making me desperate.  I find myself trying to get as close as possible to people without making them uncomfortable.  I have tried to get some of my friends to hug me when I show up or leave, but they're obviously reluctant, and at best I get a kind of guy ""chest bump"" which actually physically hurts a little now (I'm soft and squishy everywhere now - my guy armor fell off), and it's pretty emotionally devastating for me. I try to touch my friends casually sometimes (on the shoulder, or poking them in the back), but I must be really clumsy and weird, because even that has resulted in so many weird and awkward situation, and usually end up feeling so hurt and alone afterwards. 

I hug the few people I can (A friend's mom, my grandma) as much as possible and I find it hard to let go.  I don't have a girlfriend or boyfriend.  I'm a lesbian, but if I could have a relationship with a guy without sex I would do it in a heartbeat just to have someone I'm allowed to touch.  It's gotten so bad I think about maybe paying someone (a prostitute?) just to hold or cuddle me for an hour.   

Worst of all, I feel guilty about all this.  I don't understand why I need to touch people now.  I never felt like this before.  It makes me feel like a weird creepy pervert even though I am not interested in anyone sexually.  I feel like a freak every time I reach out for affection I'm rejected.  And what if I did get a girlfriend or boyfriend who let me touch them - I'm afraid I would be the most clingy person.  The idea that there is only one person in the whole world that I'm allowed to touch is frustrating to me.  

I can't talk about this with any of my friends - it's creepy enough for them that their guy buddy is turning into a chick, and I don't want to compromise my friendships any further.  I try really hard not to overstep my boundaries by touching them or asking to be hugged anymore because of the problems it has caused, but sometimes I feel like I'm going to die or wither away unless I can get someone to hold me or hug me or touch me or ANYTHING.  It's a terrible internal struggle and I end up not being able to stop myself from reaching out to them and embarrassing and hurting myself again. 

I was going to just try to wait this out, because I don't know what is causing this.  It could be that I'm just new to the hormones (3 months isn't a long time for such a dramatic change), or that I'm new to feeling like a girl and this is something all teenage girls go through.  Or maybe I'm just a very emotional and sensitive girl and I will have to learn how to cope with that (my parents have always said I was extremely sensitive, especially for a boy).  I just don't have the experience to know what this is or what is causing it, but since it has persisted and gotten worse over the last 2 months, I'm asking reddit for help.  I feel like if I have to wait another 3-6 months until I can pass as a girl to get some relief I might not make it (I'm not suicidal at all, this is just an illogical feeling, but I really do feel this way).

I'm sorry this little post turned into a fucking BOOK about my issue, so to kind of balance this out I just want to say overall my life is fantastic and I've never felt so fulfilled or had so much fun, and lately especially I've just found it so easy to be a cheerful person that people keep telling me how they appreciate having me around which makes me feel absolutely WONDERFUL.

They'll talk about their parents paying for SRS because ""it'll help you"".

(everywhere but at work/school) for two months, and in that time I've had:

most strangers don't notice me

hundreds of puzzled looks

a handful of ""maam""s

a handful of ""sir""s

a few dozen scowls

1 bus of school kids pointing and staring

zero negative comments

zero feedback from friends and aquantainces in general

1 elephant always in the room at social gatherings


None of it has made me feel sad or depressed (I don't mind being different in general, and those school kids made me LOL), rather I'm just left tired, confused, and unsure about going full time.  I've gone to social gatherings and met new people who didn't know me before transition.  One of the highlights of this is feeling like girls are talking to me in a new, friendly way.  But it feels so weird to go through an entire evening of talking to new people, and never acknowledging to them that I'm trans (that's what I mean by the elephant in the room, because even if by some miracle they don't see it right away, my voice and mannerisms give it away before long).  

In general I'm really happy, and I know my gender presentation will improve over time.   But based on my experience these last few months, I think I will have a long ""in-between"" phase for the forseeable future.  The total lack of feedback, positive and negative, is really tiring.  I wish people would tell me what they are thinking, offer some constructive feedback, tell me to GTFO, I just wish they would react somehow!  

I'll be full time at work soon (frankly, with [this being my ""boy mode""](http://i.imgur.com/fBducgT.jpg), I'm sure most people have figured it out).  At this point, if people are going to keep giving me these cool-as-a-cucumber non-reactions, then I need to just chill out and forget about being trans.  It's a huge drain of my mental energy, worrying about what they are thinking.  I need to just be confident and not care.  But how do I get there?  I feel like if some of my friends were more open to talking about how I come across, then at least that would settle my uncertainty and let me get on with living my life.  Is it possible to settle these feelings, or will I continue being drained by this in-between quasi-passing life until I can make it over to the binary female corner that I want to be in?

They are totally right, its a huge improvement and super easy to do. Here is how.

Open up yelp.com, look for ""waxing"" near ""that place where you live and such"".

Find a place that has decent reviews / stars.

Walk in, someone should greet you and ask what you want. Just say eyebrows. No one is gonna blink or give you a second glance.

They will take you past all the nail stuff and into a room with a chair thingy. 

Someone will come in and get you setup, basically thats just lying down and closing your eyes. They will probably wipe them with alcohol brush them a bit to get shape first.

If they ask what you want, just say feminine or girly. If you want to be vague just say ""a nice arch"". Apparently shape is ""in"" more than tiny brows, which works well for us, since we have lots to work with.  

On goes the wax, its not hot, more like a warm body. Cloth goes on and then it gets pulled off. It hurts much LESS than laser. It only stings a bit for a second or two.

She will probably shape them with tweezers (which is less fun, but still barely painful) and let you look. If it your first time, go conservative and let the person give you advice. 

They will do the other side and you are done. Whole process takes 15, maybe 20 minutes.

How am I going to tell her? What do I say? I wonder if dad's going to call..

Finally, 6 hours later she gets home. We catch another one (it's our bonding thing), and I help her install an expansion for a video game. Then I proceed to watch her play Skyrim for 3 hours, waiting for the right moment. Wes Craven can't build this kind of suspense. But my stepdad is apparently determined to watch her play the entire time, and I just want to come out to her alone. He's a closeted crossdresser, but outwardly pretends like he's Rush Limbaugh's #1 fan.

Finally, they get done playing, and decide to make dinner. Which they, again uncharacteristically, do together. So I finally can't take it, and I ask if I can talk to her alone. 30 minutes later she comes up stairs.

""I've known this entire year what's been causing my depression. Mom, I'm transgender. I've always wanted to be a woman.""

Pause.

Mom: ""You are my child. I would support you through absolutely anything. I don't care if you're gay, transgender, atheist, you're my son and I care about it.""
Me, literally crying: ""Could you accept me as your daughter?""
Mom: ""Absolutely.""

I cry, hug her, and she says, ""Let me tell [stepdad]. I need to break it to him slowly, and find the right opportunity.""

I didn't get to come out to my dad, who didn't call me today. I'll call and come out to him later this week, but with how lovingly accepting my mom was, I'm okay with it.

And then I spent time with the friends I came out to, and they wanted to talk about it. A lot. They asked all kinds of fantastic, and important questions. We joked about it, and acted like nothing had changed at all.

I'm scared that I'm irreparably broken. That surgery won't fix the damage caused by years of socializing as male, and years of testosterone altering my body in cruel ways. 

My mind is so used to fighting against my body, I don't know what will happen when it doesn't need to. What happens when I'm not preoccupied daily at avoiding sensing what's between my legs. What happens if there's a complication that makes it more of a focus and distraction than it already is. 

I have perfectly healthy flesh right now. But my mind has never been content with that. My fantasies have primarily included this phantom vagina that's been there since puberty. Sex with other girls has been about their vagina, and making them happy. I rationalized that was because I was a generous lover. In fact, I was living vicariously through others. It was about seeing their reaction to touch, and sharing it. Being a part of it, and letting my heart feel what they felt. 

I wish I could somehow be happy with what is there. It made my straight wife happy. I don't want to take the money away from my family. I'm so scared. But like all things dysphoria, I know it won't get better on its own. That doesn't make it any easier to deal with.

I know my social dysphoria was fixed by going full time. I'm more friendly, more outgoing, more sociable, and happier. I'm just myself around others, without worrying about acting a certain way that others expect. And that is wonderful. 

I so much want the equivalent of that for my body dysphoria. But it's a big, irreversible, scary leap. I know how amazing I feel when I can fool my brain for a few minutes at a time. Eyes closed, touched a certain way, I can feel it. It's there, in my head, for just a fleeting moment. And that brings me so much joy. Often to joyful tears. I want that to be my reality. I'm scared that somehow, it won't be. How can I deal if surgery doesn't get me there. What if I find out that will never be my reality. That's what scares me.

Despite that, however, we often have to resort to analogies to explain to our friends and loved ones what it feels like to be so at odds with your body. I was curious what sort of explanations you all have used to relate the feeling of gender dysphoria to those close to you. 

One of my favorites:

""It's like being stuck at a shitty part time job. The uniform is itchy and ill-fitting, and not even remotely flattering. You're as much of yourself as you can be, given the circumstances, but you still wind up checking every word and action to make sure you don't accidentally jeopardize your position. Your livelihood is on the line, but after so many years, you've long since forgotten the fear, leaving a dull ache and a diminished sense of presence and worth within the world. Everything emotion feels like it comes from some place far away.""

""Gender transition, by comparison, feels like coming home. It feels supremely comfortable, more comfortable than you ever knew you could feel after a lifetime spent forgetting how stifled and restrained you had become. There's a sense of immediacy within your own skin, as if you're finally *living* your life, as opposed to directing it and watching it happen to you. You are finally yourself, the same as before, but freed from the thousands of little lies you had piled on to make the days bearable.""

I was ashamed, and felt that I was destroying all of her expectations for me.  

Instead of any sadness or yelling, she turns to me and says ""if I am upset about this at all, it is only because how it complicates your life.  I just want you to be happy doing whatever you choose to do, because I love you.""

Lots of really awkward questions later, and this weight was suddenly off my shoulders.  It felt like I could do anything!  I could really go through with this.  Somehow, this gave me the permission to be proud of who I am.  Or, maybe there is something special about having such an incredibly awkward conversation that just releases me from that embarrassment.

She obviously didn't know much about it.  I helped her through it but I was too much in shock to explain very well.  I told her that I thought I might pass well with some work on my nose and chin.  She instantly protested.  ""You don't need anything it's just like my nose, it's fine!""  That immediate response felt so honest and heartwarming.  

She promised to do all kinds of research.  She told me that all she asks of me is to visit a psychologist for a second opinion.

I have yet to hear from a single one.

WTF???? I mean, I'm not gonna lie... I love the flirting and the attention that I have been getting.....BUT, I would really like for it to go somewhere. ANYWHERE. Hell! Even if it were just sex. I'd be cool with that, seeing as it's been almost 2 years, now.

I even tell them...""Look, I know a LOT of people are not interested in what I have to offer. If you don't want my number now, I understand. I won't be offended"".

I ALWAYS get...""No no! You seem really badass and I would really like to get to know you more. Give me your number"".

I just don't understand why anyone, male or female, would ask for someone's number, get it, and then not call them.

Especially the guy that kissed me on mah lips. 
It's just so frustrating. It's kinda pissing me off and I feel like I am gonna be single/celibate for the rest of my fucking life.

I had a few people who sent private messages suggesting that I repost it here.  So here's that post, along with an update.

I am a middle aged man. I am miserable. I have no life outside of my work. I have no family. I am alone. I let no one get close to me because of my secret. For over thirty years I've known that I should have been born female. I had an uncle who had the same issue, went through SRS and later committed suicide. When I was a teenager, my mother caught me wearing one of her bras. She asked me what did she do wrong. She used that secret against me multiple times since then when she wanted to hurt me or humiliate me.
I've had a few relationships with women over the years (I'm not attracted to boys). But I've either sabotaged the relationship, or went in knowing that it would most likely not work out. Three affairs with married women. And the women I've been with, have felt there was something I was holding back. That I would only share so much. I couldn't. The one time I shared my secret with someone I thought I loved was so humiliating that I don't dare repeat it.
I don't crossdress. I'm too afraid of being humiliated again. I don't have the courage to come out now, not to mention I'm too old. I'm in poor health now. The result of years of self-medication through food and alcohol. I doubt that I will live another ten years. Yes, I've thought multiple times about suicide. Earlier this year, I realized I am committing it slowly via my diet and lack of exercise. I hope if someone young reads this, someone who knows in their heart that they should be different, that it gives them the courage to try and change things now. When they can.

My situation has changed in the last three weeks. I've come out to several friends, and have received nothing but good from it.  I'm working away from home, but have started looking for a LGBT-friendly counselor back home to start with.  I've had some health issues in the past that may rule out HRT and Transition, that's still up in the air.  But, I know who I am.  I know what I am.

You will never be able to come back and do it. It's no skin off anyone's ass if you're trans. You fucking deserve happiness. But only you can get up and say, ""fuck this shit, I'm gonna transition!"" No one can do that for you, and the rectangle of dirt does not care and will not wait.

I recently came out to all my close friends and family. I am a ""128'er""...I present as female everywhere but work for now. Many ppl were okay with but did not want me anywhere near there kids when I was in girl mode. So what? The rectangle is merciless. Have mercy on yourself. You dont know how good it feels to break through and be who you are until you fucking try it.

Get out there. Buy your goddamn clothes and makeup like I did. Slam that shit on. Go out whether you pass or not, you will get better at it with practice. Rally up others in your community who are also scared and alone and need help. That's what I am doing. When I finish transitioning, I want to be in a position to help my trans bros and sisters.

The Rectangle awaits you at the end of your life, which could be anytime. Do it right and do it now! You fucking deserve to be happy. I am not letting anything stand in my way any longer, it's gonna get blown away by my resolve.

You have to come out to yourself first. Then, one by one, come out to your loved ones. It's really no skin off their ass--only yours if you dont help yourself and your trans bros and sisters.

Cis people and inferiority complex?,sadgirlfornow,45,7,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1jnjc5/is_there_life_for_me_after_transition_cis_people/,"(And I'm sorry ahead of time if this is kind of venty...)

So yesterday I was silently celebrating a little victory to myself--I was on the way home from going to the movies with my boyfriend, the first time I had left the house in a couple weeks. That's probably not much to most people, but little things like that always mean a lot to me as someone who has suffered with depression and social phobia for pretty much as far back as I can remember.

Anyway we were on the trip home. His mom was with us (she knows), and she said something that stuck with me in a weird way. ""Yesterday I was watching a show where they take someone and give them advice on how to dress, on the same channel I watch Say Yes to the Dress on..."" Having seen the show off and on over the years I offered, ""What Not to Wear?"" 

She said yes that's it, and then told me that the episode she watched featured a transgender woman who just went around in her pajamas most of the time, and that she thought that it was impressive that I was fashionable and always knew what to wear, not having all the childhood experience to learn more about it and all the advice that a lot of women relied on.

Now we almost never talk about trans stuff, but that didn't really feel like a compliment to me somehow, like kind of here-lesser-being-have-these-crumbs-from-my-table-ish? I don't know... she's a totally sweet person so it had to have been totally innocent, but being me, victory or not... I mean I had just spent my time at the movies feeling really small because we sat in front of a group of extroverted high school girls who giggled through the movie, some of the other little experiences that I never had that make me feel like an outsider. That's the real difference between me and girls who were raised as girls--I have to KNOW that I grew up in a different social place than them. I have to be conscious of it every second of every day and I always have to ask myself how much of who I am and also how much of what I struggle with is legitimately uniquely me and how much of it is just living an unusual life.

Well today I got bored and I was reading the reddit frontpage, then in another thread I saw someone posting about transphobia. I walked down that yellow brick road and suddenly my screen was full of examples of transphobia and trans people's reactions to them, discussions of feminism and transphobia, all that stuff. Honestly I'm like the least political person ever, I don't actually know that much about these things and usually I try to ignore them... but something about it just brought all this sadness back to me. Knowing that so many people out there wouldn't accept me or would hate me if they knew I was trans, even as much as or more than I don't accept myself, and as someone who is constantly taking comfort in ""you are your own worst critic,"" that's actually a terrifying prospect.

It's hard to admit but I think that having transitioned has really exacerbated my fear of people. Like, before, I had a mild fear of men but I didn't think anything of having friends who were girls, actually most of my friends were girls. Now it is somehow terrifying, and keep in mind I don't get out much, but I feel like such a fake, I feel like I either have to pretend I had a life I didn't have in order to fit in, or out myself to people and live in fear and shame and stigma. After over a year of full time, and a year on hormones, I'm still afraid of women's bathrooms, even though I've never been outed as trans anywhere anyway, never not passed, never had a negative experience, been harassed or anything.

I feel like I really need to make some new friends and experience the validity of being  accepted as a girl in more than just first encounters with people, but jumping back into a normal social life is so scary. I keep coming back to that painful awareness... I feel cornered around a group of women because I KNOW that they've most likely had so many experiences in life that shaped their self image differently than mine. I KNOW that I'm trans and I KNOW that I'm terrified of them finding out. And it's like I can't accept that. It just makes me feel like I don't belong, like I'm a sub-woman, so even if I have so many things in common with them CURRENTLY, I don't even want to try. And the worst part is when I feel in over my head. Like I'm not a strong enough person to be trans, like it's just too crazy, like I should have just lived on as an unsatisfied femme gay boy instead.

So girls and guys, what do you do when you feel like this? Where does your confidence come from? How can you believe it's really just going to be okay? I'm sorry if this was really long-winded, I think I just needed to vent, but I would really love to hear what everyone thinks.

I'm gender-ed male without a second thought. I'm not even sure I'm read as trans*. I just get called ""he"" pretty much all the time. It's not even a meanness thing, they just look at me and see a dude.

I do makeup and hair. I wear appropriate clothes. But it doesn't matter. I get bro'd in a skirt. I've had hormones for a year, laser treatments. My voice sucks, but even without the voice it's bad. It's just some weird combination of things screams male.

Listen, I'm not looking for passing tips, or re-assurances that I'll pass ""someday"". That's honestly bs. I've known women years into their transition (full-op) who don't pass. So I know it's possible, and I think I may be one of the peopl. 

But, here's the problem. **if I'm getting constantly read as male, how can I claim that I'm ""living as a woman.""** If gender is a social role, than how can I claim to have transitiioned? Doesn't that make me a transvestite by default, regardless of how I ""identify""? Have I failed at this? And, if so, what then? Just go through life being a crossdresser?

God, I just want to wear a burqa and learn sign language. I just want to crawl into a whole and never come out. I want to die. If I wasn't religious, suicide would be a pretty reasonable option. I'm not actually suicidal. But it does feel like an end of the rope situation. I just want it to stop. Or pause.

I don't wanna just sit around for a passing moment that never shows up. I'd like to know what to do if it doesn't.

Firstly, I'm currently jobless and finding spare money is getting tough. Today, I came home with about 5 full outfits including over 6 dresses, 5 skirts, 5 tops, a pair of shoes, nail varnish and a bag for about £20 by shopping around at car boot sales (items of clothes in the region of 50p-£1, got a designer dress for 2). It takes a a bit of willpower to go around buying opposite gender clothes but theres some really good second hand stuff out there for dirt cheap and you can find yourself having a chat to one or two of the traders.

I was outted to my parents by not signing out of my email the spring of my sophmore year.  Came out to some friends my junior year. Started blockers the fall of my junior year of high school and hormones the spring of senior year.   Went to college as myself.  Got the finishing touches (ie SRS) the summer after graduating from college (at 22).  
Thoughts: 
I have only two regrets.  1)That i did not start earlier (most people regrets) 2)that i did not put aside some genetic material.  
Things that have changed recently: I am more comfortable outting myself to people.  There was a period where I didn't for 5 years.   I also regret that there is no community and thus no support system for everyone.  It can be lonely even 10 years out.  Though by coming out to a few more people I even discovered a friend had a sibling who was trans.  Anyways I wish everyone the best of luck.  Happiness is always elusive but if you're true to yourself you are getting a step closer to finding it.  It is so exciting to see more people coming out and also coming out earlier.

He leaves the exam room and I'm thinking, what is he going to put me on. I know spiro is a great BP med, but is he going to give that to me early? I'm not supposed to get that until I get my E.

So I'm on the path to transition. I've got my appointment to start informed consent. I'm completely out to my wife who is willing to give this a try. I still feel like I'm being crushed by anxiety. I'm not sure I can make it through the waiting of getting the HRT because the place I'm going to requires 3 visits and that will take at least a few weeks. I'm at my wits end.

I'm still not ready to come out to my mom, who I thought would be the first person I'd come out to. Well, I started thinking about it. Maybe she shouldn't be the first. I decided that I'd ask my my best friend going back to high school, who was the best man at my wedding and the only ""guy"" friend I have to come over tonight, out of the blue. We go back about 15 years and have had a good friendship that entire time, although I've been very distant to him in the last few months while I've been working through this. He knows I have something important to tell him.

I wrote a letter, and I'm going to read it, not hand it to him. He's going to be here in the next two hours and I'm not really that afraid to do this. I felt better just writing the letter. I'll edit this after this all goes down.

Wish me luck!

Update: So I did it. I came out. I ended up going freestyle and handed him the letter I wrote afterwards. We talked for about 2 hours. There was some shock, but he knows me enough to know that I wouldn't be joking about this. My wife was there the whole time. He was pretty accepting of this whole thing, even though he knows almost nothing about trans* or even lgb issues. 

TL;DR: Came out to best friend, he accepted it and says he doesn't think our friendship will change from this. I'm feeling pretty good about things. 

Morning after update: For the first time in months I woke up this morning and didn't feel completely miserable like I usually do. I mean I still definitely have a higher than should be anxiety level and the whole cloud of trans is there, but I don't feel like it's the usual nightmare that I wake up into everyday.

If you don't live under a rock, you probably know that the Mormon church takes a firm stance against LGBTQ people. My parents live across state lines, so I haven't really been pressed for time.

Anyways, I was cycling home from a haircut last Saturday (that looks really cute, btw:), when I received a text. It was from my Dad asking me, ""when did you go see Dr. Derp?"" Dr. Derp is the doc that prescribed, and now monitors my HRT. I've never mentioned him to my Dad. I am, however, still on my Dad's insurance. I put two and two together, and instead of getting that sinking heart feeling, I actually had a very calm feeling wash over me. As I was peddling the rest of the way home, my Dad called and left a message, ""the insurance company denied your last appointment with Dr. Derp because it 'was not gender appropriate.' So you're either pregnant or someone is using your ID card. Or maybe it's something else entirely."" 

When I arrived home I instantly started typing a coming out email for my Dad. The dude is extremely stoic, rigid, and basically the type of parent that when I was a kid, my brothers and sisters and I were all afraid of him. So, calling him was out of the question; I'm too big of a wimp. I gave it my best, and laid it all out in a clear and articulate manner. I explained the science and sociology behind it, my personal trans experience, and that I would still be able to maintain my job, quality of life, etc. -- since parents worry about that type of thing. Before sending it to him, I called my Mom. They're separated at the moment. So my strategy was divide and conquer (kidding). I broke it all down to my Mom, but in a teary-eyed, hardly coherent manner. She was really confused, but told me she loved me no matter what and that I'm her angel, etc, etc. I then pressed the send button for my Dad's email, gasp.

He emailed me back the next day. The most positive part of his reply was, ""I want to be compassionate."" The rest of it included gems like, ""you are my son,"" ""obviously I expect you to dress like a man when you're around me,"" ""mental health issue,"" ""don't do anything that will embarrass me,"" and the real charmer, ""I'm firm in my belief that this is morally wrong"" (with no explanation). 

My Mom called me the next day and was pretty upset. I explained to her that this was my only real option, and that if I were to try to repress it any longer it would lead me down the path to misery. I told her to trust me, and give me the benefit of the doubt. She said she did, and she would, and the conversation ended very positively. My Mom and I have spoken every day since. She's really working on developing an understanding of this, and I feel like she's going to be a strong supporter once the initial shock wears off. She's told me a few times that she just wants me to be happy.

I haven't talked to my Dad since. I could not come up with a positive, non-confrontational response, so I let it be for now.

Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with how things turned out. One out of two isn't bad, and maybe eventually my Dad will come around. It's really all up to him now. In a way, it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. I will say though, it hasn't been easy. The past few days have been fraught with emotions, tears, and despair. But now I'm pulling out of it, and starting to feel okay again. 

Sorry for the long bit of text. I really feel like r/asktransgender has been my number one support system throughout all of this. Not to sound all cheesy (I am still pretty emotional and sentimental), but I really appreciate you all and am thankful that there's a space on the Internet with such intelligent, down to earth, and wonderful people to type stuff back and forth with.

I was meeting with the LGBTQ coordinator for my school, and it was my first time out in public under my new name and fully presenting. There was nothing that really made me nervous or uncomfortable. It's not like anyone looked at me like some kind of alien or anything. Everyone who had occasion to use pronouns over the course of the day even got my gender right. So, marking it in the win column there.

So how did this accidentally become full time? Well, I had always planned on September 1st as being the day. It was the day before my birthday and I wanted to reach that critical one year mark before my 30th birthday. But once I got home something just clicked and I said, ""I'm done with that life.""

From now on, I'm Autumn. Always and everywhere. By the end of October it'll be legal, too.

Just wanted to share with you guys. Reddit has been a huge part of my transition process alongside other support channels (mainly close friends). &lt;3 wish me luck for whatever!

**Update 1**: So it took longer than ""10 minutes"". We had some time, i literally told her first about something I had been hiding, then just blurted it out: ""I'm not who I was before, but now I know, and I need you""

**Update 2**: Ok! well, she's locked in room, me knocking on door scenario.

**Update 3**: Well, since it's out; I'm no longer obliged to hide Ophelia pics so, [here's my first internet photo post](http://imgur.com/a/XsSuQ). Opinions are welcome. It's a couple of weeks old and i've made some, err, adjustments since. But it's still me :D

**Update 4**: BRB, i'll try the door-and-knock routine.

**Update 5**: Door and knock successful, keeping my marriage going, unsuccessful. ""I can't live with you like this. You fix your own stuff""

**Update 6**: She literally yanked the car and house keys: ""going to your parents' house"". Not sure if I should follow or let die.

**Update 7**: Ok, this is it; last chance, grabbing my house keys and running after. She's calling and will hear none of it. For the sake of what happens; i *may* have to delete this post, but for now; i &lt;3 you guys, you mean a lot to me. If i find a way to update what happens, i will.

**Update 8**: She's on the phone again: ""if you really care for me, you would have given it up"".

**Update 9**: Phone call from my dad (who doesn't know either, wanted her to be the first one). ""Sleep, rest, talk tomorrow; i'm with her"". So I guess i'll gear up to do a dual showdown tomorrow.

So, sign off. Hugs and thanks. I will try my best to avoid any tear induced drowning scenarios this night. 

**Update 10** (the day after): So I basically woke up to my dad wanting to talk. We had a tough one-on-one where he wanted to know what I did to my wife. He ended up confessing he himself had seen boys at some point and we came to a middleground where I told him I now had to level with my wife. 

We drove to see her and I had a private talk with her; she was very calm and accepting, but then also asked me to ""stop pursuing your transition if you want to be with me"". I told her i wouldn't and kinda basically called her bluff (which i don't know if is healthy or not in the long term) as she then retracted and told me she would not leave me. We settled on ""the cat is out of the hat, and I will continue to pursue this matter for now"", except now I'm doing it with her knowingly which (to me) is a bit of the strict definition for coming out of the closet.

There were loads of tears and it's been very very stressful. I plan on going on and slowly introducing her to Ophelia's (my) life (i believe she doesn't suspect I carry a name, much less go fulltime a couple of days a week, but that will come later).

I really want to hug, kiss, then hug again everyone here. The guys and gals who pushed me to pursue her after she left, the people that commented straight after I posted, and yes, even the people who jumped straight into harsh criticism. Thanks to you I today have a shot at having a comprehensive wife alongside my transition, which to me is the best of both worlds.

I can finally blend in, fly under the radar, be undetectable. I can finally hold up a proper social interaction without wanting to run back in my room and hide under the covers forever. I am much less a danger to myself, and definitely no longer one to others. But sometimes, since I forget where I came from, I forget how bad things use to be, too.

And I focus on everything that's wrong now. All the legal and practical barriers that transitioning has created in my life. In my usual consciousness, my teen years really don't exist. It's like I fell asleep at age 8 or 9, had a long nightmare, and suddenly woke up as a groggy and confused adult - only to realize that none of my childhood dreams are viable options anymore, due to these new structural barriers. I get angry at myself, at being trans, at having to transition.

Only when I am reminded of the concrete substance of my past, of the nightmare that I used to live, that I really embrace the reality of my transition - with gratitude, with disbelief. Still, after all this time. I can't believe that nightmare isn't real anymore. I can't believe that I am actually free to walk away from it now, if I chose to do so. And I do. But as I walk away, I keep turning to look back. It seems I rely on the reminders, the hellish flashbacks, in order to continue justifying my transition.

Because I feel empty. I've spent nearly all of my conscious life fighting with the pain, fighting the life or death struggle, that I actually don't know what to do with myself in its absence. What people don't realize is how the experience of mind-body incongruence affects your growth and development as a person. I've never had real interests, never had a real social life, never even grew up in the first place. 

I have no family, no close friends, and no sense of vocational direction, because I never thought I would still be alive at this age in the first place. Fixing what's wrong doesn't automatically make things right. It makes things not-wrong-but-not-right. I had a traumatic experience with a prominent member of my local trans community and now have trouble trusting other trans people. I don't even know where I can begin to heal. I don't want to be clinging onto fragments of the past just to deal with the emptiness and lack of direction going forward. Doesn't that kind of defeat the whole point?

By my 17th birthday (Oct '11) my immediate family and girlfriend at the time knew. But it took 6 months, more intensive therapy and a hospitalization to finally start my transition. In April '12 i got my first dose of estrogen and anti-androgens. The mental, emotional and physical changes came quickly. By week 4, my breasts had started growing. By July the changes were so obvious that people started noticing, so I decided to start living life fulltime. I came out to all my friends, my parents told my extended family, and I never left the house presenting as a boy again. But i was still not satisfied. Some people could tell I was trans by how I look (it still happens sometimes). I would cry when I was alone because I felt that being born male made me less than a cis-girl. I let society's uneducated view of transgender people affect how I perceive myself. I tried to validate my identity through hyper-femininity. It didn't work. I vowed that when I got older I would move somewhere where nobody knew me, and would live completely stealth. 

Even though I was full-time, and all my friends and family accepted me, I was still unsatisfied. Because *I didn't accept myself*. Over the last few days, I have come to terms with who I am, and have felt inner peace that I have never experienced. I am done trying to fit the societal idea of what a woman should be. I'm only now starting to truly be myself. I am a girl, with short hair, I am bisexual (but more attracted to women) I act more girly around my girl-friends and goof around with my guy friends. On the spectrum I would say I am 'femme' but slightly androgynous. None of this makes me any less of a woman. It's not possible for me to ""want to be a girl"". I am one already! I mean, I'm making my body congruent with my gender, but it does not determine whether or not I am a woman. This is stuff I've always told other people, but never did i apply it to myself. Well I've finally started practicing what I preach.

It has been difficult, but I am blessed (in a weird way). While cisgender people will never know the pain of feeling like a stranger in your own body, or overcoming obstacles to be yourself, they will also never know the euphoria and joy of becoming the person you always want to be, a little more each day. 

I have no plans of hiding my trans identity any longer. I'm not going to tell random people, but I will not allow myself to be ashamed of it. I want to do what I can to change people's perception of transgender men and women. I will educate whoever and whenever i can. 

Sorry for the disjointed wall of text, or the fact that it wasn't even a question. I havent been this happy in my whole life, and I need to share it with my trans brothers and sisters. I can't Imagine being where I am without reading all of your questions, tragedies and triumphs. You are all worthy of love and acceptance for who you are.

This was going to be a question until I realised I'd already made my decision, so I'm just sympathy whoring and looking for virtual hugs. If that's OK. Sorry for the long post :-/

I wanted to write with some good news - my dad came to visit me last week, first time I've seen him in 18 months, first time he's seen me post-transition, and he was very pleasant and complimentary, said some nice things about my hair and bought me a really pretty scarf that he said I'd like because it was ""girlie"". Big relief - slowly the folks are edging towards acceptance.

But we've known for a few months now that my Gran is on the way out - bowel and liver cancer - and I summoned up the courage to go and visit her in boy clothes about six weeks ago and she was really pleased to see me. Again, big relief, considering the last thing she had said to me before that (New Years) was ""I never want to see you again you will never be welcome in my house"". But just having to ""man up"" for a couple of hours kicked off a really serious spiral of depression that ended with me having seriously suicidal thoughts for a good while, out of work and in no fit state to start looking.

So now I'm just crawling out of that hole, starting to feel positive again, got a job interview lined up in a couple of days, and I get a phone call from my sister to tell me that Grandma only has a few days left; I'm welcome to visit her in the hospice but only in boy clothes and I will not be able to stay overnight with either her or my parents. My first reaction, out of guilt and a sense of duty, was to book a train ticket to go and visit tomorrow morning. Then I thought about it and chatted to my best friends and really considered how much of a negative effect it could have on me and I really don't think I can do it. I just spent £100 on a non-refundable train ticket, and I'm expecting bad reactions from my sister and mother, like I'm just being the self indulgent and stubborn one and I should be there for the family. But honestly it would kill me to have to dress and act like a man, even for a few hours, especially in the presence of the people who are supposed to love me. It's not a question of pride, or ""not giving in"", I just can't take that kind of risk with my mental health and emotional wellbeing. But I still feel horribly guilty. I wish I could be there, not for my Gran but for my Ma who is about to lose her own mother. I should be able to put my arms around her and tell her I love her and we've all got each other and everything's going to be OK. But she doesn't want me to tell her that. She wants her imaginary son and I can't be that person for her. It kind of sucks. Sorry for the rant.

TLDR: hugs please!

EDIT: thanks for all the redditlove, people. You guys are awesome. It's 8.30am here and I didn't take the train. She's too whacked out on painkillers to know that I'm there anyway, and as much as I want to give my mum some love I wouldn't be able to do it in drag because I wouldn't be able to feel anything at all. When the time comes for the funeral I will light a candle in Southwark Cathedral and say a few private prayers.

UPDATE: thanks again for all the hugs! I feel more community here than I ever did in any IRL support groups, so I really appreciate it. Grandma passed away peacefully this afternoon. I wasn't with her but I was knitting at the time and thinking of all the times I used to sit and watch her knit things when I was little and all the ""brown paper packages tied up with string"" that used to bring home made jumpers and hats and scarves through the post. I'm just grateful that I had such an incredible, inspiring lady in my life, the girl my grandpa likened to Rita Hayworth, and a big part of what made me the woman I am today.

Since there do seem to be issues of ongoing contention between the G and T elements of some LGBT communities, and I'm a big fan of 'mutual understanding' being the key to a peaceful life, I just thought it was worth raising our mutual surprise.

Now personally I wasn't offended because I don't have much of a problem with that word, but I felt it was my duty to politely point out to him on behalf of ""our"" community that many people do find it deeply offensive, on the level of n#gger, p#ki or f#ggot, and it might be best not to use it again. He apologized profusely and said he would avoid using it in the future.

I'm only raising it here because it would have been easy for me to go in with all guns blazing and create more contention out of something which is a genuine misunderstanding, because I had no idea myself that the word is used as an affectionate term of endearment among the gay/drag crowd - it's not just that he didn't mean it offensively, but that he wasn't even referring to ""our"" people anyway.

I mean, the clothes, the attention (I am sure some of it had to do with my dad hitting me but never my sisters)... I just wanted to be one. I used to sneak and wear my mom's clothing, the sexier the better because it made me feel more and more like a woman (mind you, this is before I even had my first erection).

Once I hit puberty, it then became a sexual thing, maybe just a kink I thought to myself. I used to go out with just a pair of panties on, or pantyhose, or a bra just to be able to say to myself that I am not a man, but a woman. Regardless of what everyone else saw or thought.

When I started dating, it sort of went to back of my mind. Became less important (though it became very hard for me to engage in sex when I wasn't imagining myself as a woman). And so I got married. Had kids. And now I am stuck. I feel this need to be true to myself more and more. I have taken some online tests to see if what I have is just a kink or a true identity issue (which I found out it seems to be). But I can't transition. I couldn't do that to my family, to my kids, to my wife. I need to be the provider, I have to be able to do that for them. Because transitioning would mean I would have to take time for myself, something I don't really do. Plus, I feel that I am too old, too tall, too overweight to be anything other than a man in dress and not a woman. Because while I used to not care what other people thought when they saw me, I now do. I want to be seen as a woman, I want to be able to pass. And I know I can't... not anymore.
So this is just me trying to say the words that will NEVER be able to utter: I am a woman, but I am also a man. I hate myself rather regularly. I want to lose weight but if I do, I'm afraid that I will lose my man-boobs which is the most womanly part of my body I have. So I screw up my weightloss and exercise and so on. I love it when my daughter paints my nails, but I don't want to ask her to to it all the time.. I have to play up that I am suffering and only doing it for her.

* hate their genitals
* always show signs of absolutely being the other sex for their whole life
* transistion all the way and never look back
* look down on less extreme transistions 
* get extremely upset when not gendered appropriately

My thought process is that this way of thinking emerged as a defense mechanism against family scrutiny and gate keepers.  Its a search for legitimacy.  It's a search for acceptance from an unaccepting world.  ""If I have to be this way, who are you to judge me?"" Also, it is fearing regret and cognitive dissonance.  But there seems to be a zeitgeist of a new way of looking at things.  

The idea that we don't have set roles, that gender change is not a one way street to a set destination seems to be catching on.

I think that it is silly to think that our whole brains are the other gender's.  If there were hormone issues in utero, it seems far more likely that it would create a mosaic.  Plus, we trans* are indoctrinated with our birth sexes hormones at least part of the time.

Sure the cissexism sucks, but once you remove that bs, being trans is awesome! We have the knowledge of multiple gender experiences, which was revered knowledge in native American and Polynesian cultures for example with ""two-spirit"" folk. We can shape our bodies and our identities as we see fit. We have so much freedom to build ourselves as we define ourselves! We get to live our own truth! As a queer identity, being trans is awesome because it throws itself in the face of a thousand years of western gender standards, and turns it on its head, showing how absolutely silly those gender standards are. I get to fight for every bit of my womanhood which makes me cherish and appreciate that much more. 

Trans people are beautiful, we are beautiful, and we are more human and in touch with who we are then almost any other population on earth! How is that not badass? Seriously! I'll probably end up making a video or blog post explaining this more, but I just wanted to tell you, just because you're trans doesn't mean you're less then your cisgender counterpart. In fact, we are more in touch with our gender then our cisgender counterparts because we don't take our gender for granted. We fight for every bit of it.

They are an excellent start for anyone who is going ""Oh God Oh God, am I trans*, am I not? Someone please please please help me.""

There is a ton of other thought provoking content in there as well, just gotta go looking around for it. I would say if I had to pick one, it would be her last post, a lot in it to think about, but is good:

For fun I will post a couple others as well, because hey why not, got my ""Natalie Reed Fangurl 4eva"" t-shirt on (I do not actually own a t-shirt that says this.):

http://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/a-real-name/

The one on detransition especially should be included with the other two for helping questioners actually, I know a lot of people are afraid of moving forward, because what if they get half-way in and suddenly realize they aren't trans* , or are just at a bad place in their life and will wake up ""not feeling trans*"" anymore, and don't want to make a ""mistake"". Letting the idea of detransitioning be okay would be a good thing for us I think. 

Alright, and if you enjoyed all of this, again, try to donate to the lovely Reed, and go forth and find other blogs or writers along these trans feminist lines! One of Reed's big points is that we often pay too much attention to white, binary identified trans* people. Would be a shame to ignore her warnings on that point. I feel a certain duty to share some of the other ones I have looked into but it is already half an hour past my bed time so maybe I will do that later. Good luck my friends, in your all glorious gender flavors.

I have been for a couple months now. I've done a lot of exploring. I've read ""The Null Hypothe-cis"", and detransitioner blogs, and truscum (basically FTM's who belief that ONLY the classic trans-narrative is true) blogs, and trans* blogs, and it got me thinking. We talk a lot about things that suggest you might be trans*. But we don't talk much about things that suggest you could be cis, or shouldn't fully transition, or might be non-binary rather than ftm or mtf. So I want to do a thought experiment.

You guys get a lot of ""am i trans?"" posts. I should know. I've posted one. So let's say someone posts one of these, and something they said sounds like they might be misunderstanding themselves. What would it be?

What are things that, to you, would be indicators that someone isn't transgender, or should be looking more into non-binary identities, or that they might regret transition down the road, or that they need to reflect a bit more on why they want/believe this. And I don't mean stuff like ""well, I didn't know when I was 4"". I know that lacking the famous/blatant signs doesn't mean you aren't trans.

I know that everyone here is wary about telling other people whether they're trans or not. Usually, I agree with that stance. But I'm honestly worried that I'm making a mistake, that if I do this I'll end up detransitioning. (this is partially a discussion I think we need to have, but partially for me). 

I'm not asking for things that definitely 100% mean someone isn't trans. I'm not asking for a red stoplight. I'm asking for a yellow stoplight.

Puberty basically involved me compartmentalizing away all those feelings: why did I want to be a girl, I wasn't like them in any way, this is ridiculous! And other than that nagging doubt every time I looked in the mirror, and occasionally wanting to be rid of testosterone, I wasn't bothered by it much. I just did my thing and got on with life. Hey look, I made it to 31; in a little over a month I'll be 32.

Oh sure, I still want to be female, but here I am telling myself that that's just something I *want*, like ice cream for dessert or a faster computer.

Being close to attractive women my age makes me feel horribly uncomfortable with my body, but hey, don't do that then, right? I'll just hide behind my screen, throw myself on some interesting piece of computer code, and I'll be fine. ""Dammit, why can't I be like her, I hate myself"" and wanting to severely hurt myself is the closest I've yet come to self-harm, but I'm telling myself that maybe I've talked myself into that. Why would I want to kill myself over this, anway, I can choose not to be like this, right? Just focus on something else.

And here I am, feeling extremely guilty for addressing my gender issues, for even *considering* to transition. Because somehow I seem to not be bothered so much by it all. Because I read all those anguished life stories, and I'm thinking: why do I think I'm even remotely *like* these people...

I really miss Mom. I love him, but he is never around anymore. I've heard that a lot of Trans* folks go through something akin to puberty as they have hormone therapy (Mom started hormone therapy in August). 

I would like to know if this behavior is common, if it will calm down (as in he will come home before 2am) eventually, what I can do in the meantime to support him in his journey, and if there is a way to get across the fact I miss him without making him feel bad?

**TL;DR:** Mom is FTM. He started hormones last August. He isn't around much. I miss him a lot. Is this change in behavior common, how do I support him, how do I let him know I miss him without stomping on his self-exploration?

1339723352.0,34,self.asktransgender,v2ocf,Teacher may have outed me to the school. Please advise (and give me an absence excuse for tomorrow.),EnsoElysium,40,6,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/v2ocf/teacher_may_have_outed_me_to_the_school_please/,"I study in a hairstyling school, and I am the only boy there, as far as anyone knows. I wanted this place to be the one place where no one knew and I could just be me without anyone knowing of my past.
I only told one of my classmates who has a genderqueer girlboyfriend, because I knew she would understand and respect my boundaries. 

We've gotten really close since then. The only other person I told was my teacher at the beginning of the course, because I needed to go downtown every few weeks for bloodwork and injections, and I didn't want her thinking I was just making up excuses. I told her however that this was a secret that needed to be taken to the grave, and I was only telling her for medical reasons, that it didn't change anything, and should never be spoken of again.

As everyone knows, a lot of girls tend to be very gossipy. For some reason after I came back from an anxiety break (after my teacher had publicly humiliated me for crying in class.), a lot of my peers were treating me differently and wouldn't really talk to me, and when they did, they would act confused and uncomfortable. I thought it was just another stupid homophobia thing, because I definitely do not hide my big flamboyant gay self, but this was different.

On wednesday, after a really long day of clients, I was hanging out with this other girl in a classroom, talking about how much the rumor mill turns in our school. I told her there weren't any rumors about her, and then asked if there were any about me.

""Well.. People are saying that you used to be a girl.""

Cue heart dropping into stomach.

""...But I don't even know if I believe that, and even if you are, it doesn't change anything.""

...cue heart rising slowly.. feel brave enough to come out...

""So hey when are you getting the surgery?""

Cue heart turning to stone and crumbling into dust.

This is exactly why I don't want people knowing.

I want to say I don't care if people know, but I do. I really do care. People treat you different when they find out you're trans. It's like they don't trust you. They have so many questions.

I finally had a place where I could be completely stealth. I was slipping completely under the radar, even pre-T. The only people who knew were a lesbian with a trans partner (outing someone? I find that hard to believe) and my teacher. A menopausal woman who I've found out through just interacting with her, that she is a lot more homophobic and bigoted than she lets on. She treats the two lesbians in my school with a snobby attitude, intentionally ruins my cuts, soak the clients neck when I'm washing them to show me how to ""do it properly"" and deliberately talks behind my back within earshot.
I feel like I'm dying inside. I don't want to go in to school tomorrow. I already called and said I wasn't coming in today because of a stomach bug. Really it was a stress stomachache that caused me to puke once, so I used it as an excuse. I really need another one for tomorrow.

I don't think that me going in will be a very good idea. I feel like backhanding her, and I'm not even sure if she's the one who blabbed. What do I even say to her? ""Hey remember that secret I told you at the beginning of the year that I told NO ONE else except a tight-lipped lesbian about? Guess what everyone's talking about now!?""

And what if she says it wasn't her? Do I believe her? Do I just ask her to address the rumor mill? Do I quit? Do I slip into a terrible depression and have anxiety attacks and disassociate all da- oh wait, check.

I was finally starting to get better.

Apparently they instantly knew something was up as I never come and visit them of my own volition. Not that I have a bad relationship with them, quite the opposite. I just tend to be busy trying to hold together my social life when I'm not working (I think most of us can relate to that). 

Anyway, I gathered the nerve to say something on Saturday evening and had a big coming out speech written down though that kind of went out the window and I ended up blubbering into my mum's shoulder for half an hour. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done (and I survived being an effeminate geek in a rural New Zealand high school so that's saying something) but somehow everything went better than expected. My parents are certainly shocked but they're being extremely supportive. My dad is doing the cautious, uninformed parent thing (""are you sure?"", ""be careful if anyone's influencing you"") but my mum is really into it, we had a good girly chat about names and clothes and what hair styles would suit me and the changes hormones would bring.

It's extremely elating given how many horror stories that many of us face from the people who should support us the most. It's also causing me a lot of guilt. What did I do to deserve parents that can accept something like this? ¯\\(°_0)/¯

I hope people can get something out of this rambling, what I'm trying to get across is that it isn't all doom and gloom with family, and good luck to people going through similar things now or in the future.

It was fun, as usual.",ariscova,42,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1kk881/thanks_for_the_visit_mom_it_was_fun_as_usual/,"I was kicked out of my house in June when my dad searched my bags while I was out seeing a movie with a friend. He physically stopped me in the kitchen, asking me why my bottles were empty (I had finished a month's worth of estradiol and spiro a few months earlier while I was finishing up school, and forgot to take the bottles out of my bag when I came home) and when I told him that I had finished the pills within those bottles, he started becoming hostile, calling me a freak, and telling me that I'd never be normal. I told him that he was wrong, and eventually things escalated to the point where I told him to fuck off, at which point, he grabbed me and threw me to the ground. I threatened to call the cops, to which he threatened to lie and say that I attacked him first if I did. He then made me gather up my clothes in a trash bag, and made me leave the house in the middle of a storm with my cat.

Fast forward two months later: I withdrew my savings of $4,000 and moved back into the apartment that my parents used to pay for while I attended college. My mom called me one afternoon and asked to see if she could come visit me during the weekend before school started, as she is a librarian up near Kansas City. Against my better judgment, and the advice of my gender therapist, I agreed to see her, hoping that she'd just want to spend time with me and that I'd be able to avoid the topic of hormones.

We were in the car for about 30 minutes driving around town, when we stopped to get lunch. She then told me that she wanted me to continue seeing a Christian counselor that I had agreed to see to appease them while I was still trying to finish college, and that I needed to make amends with my father. I immediately started to get upset to which she told me that it wasn't right to tell my dad to ""fuck off"" while I was in his house, and that he was just ""heartbroken"" because he thought I was still taking hormones.

My head was spinning by the time that our food got to us. She eventually asked me if I was still on hormones (I've been on them for the past 1.5 months while I haven't been living with them) and I'm too stupid to lie, so I told the truth.

I asked to be taken back to my apartment because I wasn't feeling well, and on the way back, she kept asking me why I thought I needed to do this, and that nothing about me was feminine so I wasn't going to make anything better by taking hormones, and that I needed to be happy with myself instead of trying to change who I am, because I'd never be able to afford the surgery, and that God made me a boy and that's what she gave birth to, and if I did this, I'd probably never be able to be around them ever again. The worst part is, I don't really know what to say to her when she asks me questions or says things like that. I just kind of stare in the opposite direction and nod my head and murmur, ""Okay, mom.""

My favorite part was when she asked me if I had any transgender friends, and I told her that I was a member of a support group in town. She asked me if I didn't get the creeps being in the same room as them, and that that's what she and any normal person would feel like being around transgender people. She then asked me if I was being manipulated by any of them to be transgender, or that because I felt accepted by these people, that I wanted to be just like them. To get her off my back, I agreed to go see her counselor again in two weeks to talk about getting anxiety and depression medication, both of which I have, but have been less of an issue since I haven't been talking to my parents.

I'm 22, and about $2800 of my initial savings remain. I have a Bachelor's in Psychology with no student loans to pay back. My overall rent is about $800 a month, and I've been lax in searching for a job, because I've made several friends that I've grown really attached to over the past 2 months that accept me and I've had lots of fun with, however, I've sort of used them as a sort of escape from the situation that I'm in, and I won't be able to stay here in this apartment for much longer. My parents own my car and my health insurance, and could probably take them away from me at any point, so I don't really know what to do at this point.

TLDR: A visit from my estranged parents went about as poorly as expected.

1375234258.0,34,self.asktransgender,1je3ah,PSA: Get yourself a bra that fits,ATallWren,38,4,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1je3ah/psa_get_yourself_a_bra_that_fits/,"Good evening fellow transsexual ladies, I have been thinking recently that I was only saved from buying terrible bras by a friend of mine who is an expert on them. Ill-fitting bras can stunt your breast growth, even permanently reduce it, so do yourself a favor and get a bra that fits from the start. It is much more comfy this way anyways.


The basics are easy, need two measurements, your band and bust. Band is directly underneath your breasts, around the chest, under the arms, pulled tight against the ribs. Bust is across the widest part of the breast, typically the nipples. Subtract (Bust - Band) = Cup Size, A = 1 inch difference, B = 2, C = 3, see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassiere_measurement#Cup_sizes_vary) for the rest. 


How this relates to actually buying bras is that you use that information to size yourself. For example, I have a 34"" band, 36"" bust, so I buy bras that are 34Bs. That isn't set in stone however, as for example I can get away with 36s as well, because bras typically have multiple band settings so you adjust them for comfort. Is best to try them on first as well obviously, but if this is not an option for you, the internet has a wide variety of places you can get them. My Amazon Prime account has saved me much money and embarrassment so far by allowing me to test out various clothing styles and cuts in relative privacy.


You will need a tailor's tape for this I recommend [this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7YW7Y/ref=s9_simh_gw_p364_d0_i4?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=09PX4N6MJ7WKEVZRJ2CV&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1389517282&amp;pf_rd_i=507846). It makes it pretty easy to measure yourself, allowing you to do this all in private. I dunno about other people, but I am not nearly coordinated enough to use regular tailor's tape on my own without frustration. Please see /r/abrathatfits if you have more questions!

EDIT: 

I guess I wasn't clear enough judging by comments, so I will say explicitly state these are ONLY THE BASICS. Once you have a decent amount of breast development you will have to work to figure out how to best serve yourself in your bra purchases, but thankfully there is many advanced guides out there as well. Again, /r/abrathatfits is a good starting resource I would recommend going to, and I'm sure people there will be able to point you to other resources if you need them.

It is a good point in general to say that you should be going to stores and trying on clothes to see how they fit and look on your body. Just because your measurements say something will fit doesn't mean the particular cut or style will fit well or look nice. However, going out in public and rampaging through the women's section is nerve wracking for most of us, so we have to make do with what we have sometimes when it comes to e-shopping or however else we anonymize our purchases.

I'm 32, almost 33. I have been with my boyfriend for 6 years. Tonight, he told me that he needed to talk to me. 

The way he started the conversation, I really didn't expect it to take such a big turn. When we first started dating, I was nearing 30. At the time, I had told him that I wanted to get married and have kids before the big 3-0. He said that was allright with him and we've been together ever since, although.. the kid thing and marriage thing didn't exactly happen on time, but that was ok. For the most part, I can accept that things don't always turn out how you plan.

He asked me if I still wanted to have kids and would I stay with him if he didn't? Kids are important to me. Marriage, not so much. But definitely, kids. I definitely didn't expect the reason why he didn't want to have kids was because he was going to start taking hormones that would make it impossible for him. 

It was really hard for him to finally tell me. I thought I was going to be sick while my brain was jumping to all sorts of conclusions while he was trying to spit everything out. When he finally told me all, or at least most, of it.. I was a little bit in disbelief. 

I work nights as an RN and he has apparently been going to see a psychologist on Thursdays while I'm asleep. I had no idea that any of this had been going on. He's always been a little on the feminine side, but mostly because of his small frame and height. He's never acted in any way that would make me question his gender identity. 

I have no idea what to do or where to go from here. I'm worried and sad and a little scared. Of course, I don't want things to change. I wish he could just keep on being who he is now. I can't possibly fathom how he feels though. Well, I can a little.. I have body dysmorphic disorder and have always felt fat and ashamed of how I looked regardless of my actual size. I understand enough to know that no matter how thin I am, it doesn't make a difference. I worry that he'll go through this change and still feel unsatisfied. 

I need help and advice. I feel betrayed and I feel like a fool. I'm ashamed that I feel slightly sorry for myself. I'm old and still want to have children with a husband, or someone who actually wants the role of a husband.. and it seems like that will be completely impossible for me now. 

I also feel.. I don't know to explain it. I know this is something that I can't tell him to change. I supposed I'll eventually have to start calling him her instead.. (Please don't take offense that I haven't already started to, I haven't quite reconciled it in my mind) But.. I want him to be happy. I'm afraid for him. What if he does all this and still doesn't feel like he fits? He's pretty much decided that he needs to disappear off the face of the planet. He'd rather have his family think he was dead than know this. 

What options are there for him? for me? for us? I guess if someone could direct me to a support group, I would really appreciate it. I don't really know what else to do. I think I'm going to try to talk with his psychologist too, but.. it's the weekend.. so any answers or advice you have to give until then would be nice.  Thanks.

-----------------
Edited to add:

I'm not sure if anyone will check back on this, but I wanted to thank everyone for commenting and give a small update. 

While he was still slightly drunk, he admitted a few things to me. He doesn't really care about how others see him and is fine with identifying as a male, being referred to as he, etc. He doesn't have the desire to change the way he dresses. The biggest issues he has is mainly his body hair and the fact that his body is more angular than he feels it should be. He doesn't really care to have breasts, although he said he would be ok with it if he did. He doesn't hate his penis. 

This slightly confuses me because I can't quite wrap my ahead around what to me seems like such minor changes. I do wonder though, if/when he does go through with hormone replacement, that he wouldn't want to go further with his transformation. 

Apparently, while I was sleeping, it gave him time to think. He's been struggling with the issue since he was about seven. He thought that he was ready to give everything up and commit to changing, until he sobered up and really thought about the consequences. Now he's not sure if pursuing HRT is worth possibly losing me. It's flattering, and I will admit mostly what I would like to happen.. but I worry about him ending up resenting me or regretting what essentially feels like him putting my happiness above his own. I'm willing to work on finding a way for him to feel comfortable with himself, whatever that may be. 

We spent the evening fairly normally together.. He even mentioned something about our future children turning out one way or another. I haven't pushed the issue and have just let the situation be what it is. I'm not sure about him, but I think I've come to the conclusion that we'll stay together as long as we're both happy.. I'm not sure how long that will be, but it's really no different than any other relationship. 

Thanks again for all the comments. Even though I did eventually get to talk with my friend, it's not like she has any experience in the matter. What I've found here has been really invaluable to me.

I'm heading to bed, but I will check back in the morning.I've been struggling the last week about what to do about a situation at my work that centers around a transgender woman. Since I have no idea about the struggles facing the transgender community, I come to you all for advice. Please bear with me as this is bound to be a long post. I really need some advice.

First off, I work with individuals with disabilities in a group home setting in the lowest management position. After this Wednesday I will be transferring to another department for personal reasons, so I need to do something about this situation soon. I live in an intolerant area of the midwest.

About 2 weeks ago, my manager hired a girl, let's call her Sally. Sally did not start working at our facility until this past Saturday due to issues getting her paperwork in on time. Last Tuesday, a full 4 days before Sally started, my replacement, let's call her Ashley, came to our facility and talked with the staff on duty about the new hire, Sally. At this point, there is no way that Ashley could have ever laid eyes on Sally. Ashley used extremely offensive language to describe Sally as transgender. As far as I can tell, the only way Ashley could have found this out is from the manager that hired Sally. Ashley and said manager are very tight and are currently living together. Obviously, it is horribly unprofessional of the manager to tell Ashley this information. So, long story short, this gossip got around to most of the staff on our team before Sally even started work. I am assuming that because Sally is still young, she has not yet changed her birth certificate and SS card to reflect her gender/prefferred name so that is probably how management knows, as these are required to be hired. To make matters worse, Sally has been asked to move to a men's facility after she had expressed so much excitement about working with our ladies. She was not open with me about the reason why, but I think I can make a good guess... 

Our manager came in on a Saturday, the day Sally started and pulled her into the office privately. I have never in my two years at this company seen this happen before. Management avoid work on Saturdays like the plague... Anyway, when Sally came out of this meeting, she seemed anxious and uncomfortable, but after a little while seemed to calm down. She later told me she had been asked to move to the men's facility. Sally has also been asked to only shadow at the women's home until they can get her over to the men's facility. Usually trainees only get one day to shadow before they are put on the floor. I think Sally has been asked to not be alone with any of the ladies we serve, which really makes me angry.

I spent all night last night trying to find any laws against discrimination in the workplace for trans people, but unfortunately there  are none in my state. There are however policies in place at my workplace against management and staff telling others personal information.

Sally has no idea any of this has gone on, but I'm very afraid she will hear about it soon, probably from a bigot. 

I guess what I'm asking is, if you were Sally, what would you want me to do? Would you want to be informed of this situation so that you can make an informed decision about working in a place where everyone knows your business? Should I pull together some other witnesses (who are also very upset by this situation) and lodge a formal complaint with HR and send copies to upper management? Should I do nothing because it's not my business and may pull her into a situation she's uncomfortable in?

I've shed tears and lost sleep worrying about this situation and I really need your help. Please let me know if I've said anything wrong or offensive or if I've left out any important details.

Update: Thanks for the kind words everyone. I'm feeling a little better now that I have a little perspective. :) You all had some great advice which I talked over with my partner...ultimately I still need to work on the idea that it's okay to be outside the gender binary, or to be a little masculine once in a while. I get pretty intolerant of myself sometimes and I need to learn to knock it off. 


Update 2, a few days later: I'm back to normal, and happy to be where I am. :) 

Being trans is absurdly hard for everyone, regardless of where you are or how far along you are in transition.

No one gave me any funny looks at the appointment or at the old stop sign/traffic stops, very surprised on that one. . .

From getting off the bad hormones, fashion advice, and finally being able to face someone and tell them about my hidden side, I don't know where I would be without you.

EDIT:Well, I went to the center. Walked around the door that led to the LGBT counselor for about 5 minutes. Sat down, read a few articles in a newspaper while spying on the door. Finally got up, decided this would be the time to finally go in. Just kidding. Walked past it and got a drink at the water fountain. Finally went up to the door and knocked.
Someone said to come in. There were 6 people my age sitting in a family-style room watching a movie. I asked if (insert name of counselor) was there and one of the guys said he was on a very long phone call. I know it is selfish, but I just wanted to come out to one person today, I don't want to talk to anyone else. So my legs start shaking and I can feel myself getting pale. I stay for a little bit and this one guy comes up and says he'll be taking the phone call for another hour and I can wait with them if I'd like.
Nope.
I said I would just come back later and try again. They all seemed very nice and looked like they were trying to help me as much as possible, but it just didn't go as planned.
So I'm walking out of (insert name of building here) and I think it is a major mission failure. However, I have enough adrenaline in my veins to still do something brave. So I walk a mile to my former employer's office (who happens to be an ally) and spill the beans shortly after walking in.
I cried for a good 10 minutes but it was very relieving. She was very nice and was just as open and friendly as anyone could have asked for.

He tells me he's always felt like that but felt he had ""got over it"" and it came back. I feel he should have told me even if that was the case because thats important information to know.

He's been playing this whole other character with me all this time.... cuz he doesnt even act or seem womanish at all. He's very much - man- as far as I can tell. We have had a wonderful relationship...  he's not gay and definitely no problems in the sex department. In fact its the first relationship I ever had where my boyfriend actually paid so much attention to me in that way. And now he just wants to take that away? I don't even see how we could have a sexual relationship if he gets a sex change. I dont like girls!! I am so straight...  I don't even have a single bi leaning. I know I am not bi or lesbian...

I've only told a select few very close friends and all of them are like WHAT? I dont think anyone really believes it. I still am trying to believe it.  I don't know where to go from here....  i don't know how to be supportive of this. I can't just start calling him a her or considering him as a woman. To me he's my boyfriend. I don't want to break up with him and he doesn't want to leave me either... but how can this even work? I also feel in a weird situation because he mentioned suicide. I feel like if I make any split decisions he might go off himself and then it'd be my fault. I don't want him to do that. I care so much about him but this is so hard to accept.


Update:  Sorry I didn't update this sooner... but we have since broke up. We try to remain friends. I think it still kills us both.

So we can't be together. It's just all very sad really... I am just trying to move on. I worry about her...   it still feels weird to put ""her/she""... I typed ""him/he"" at first.

My intention is not to troll, it's to address a problem I have with the common answers to this question, in the hope of better understanding myself. You’re about the closest thing I have to friends who understand this stuff, so I hope you can help without getting too upset. Please tell me if I say something wrong or disrespectful and I'll try and do better next time.

I'm transgendered, and trying to decide if I should begin to transition. I'm working my way through the questions I don't understand to make sure I have good answers to them, for my own peace of mind. One of the many things that scare me about transition is the idea that I might be ""fake"".

There's a question I hear a lot, from people who are new to the idea of transgender issues, and from people who are trying to troll. It's usually something like: ""If I decide I am a cat, is that okay? You must treat me like a cat now! I feel I am a cat, and if you don't call me a cat you are a hater!""

The answer I hear most often is usually of the form: ""There is a medical basis for my gender identity. My brain [or some other physical characteristic] is literally different, I was born this way."" I'll call this the ""medical"" answer.

Now, I'm really uncomfortable with the medical answer. It implies to me that it would be okay to disrespect a transgendered person's identity if there wasn't this medical underpinning. Consider a hypothetical situation in which a test is developed which can prove what my ""internal"" gender is, and that I should transition. Imagine if such a test was to be retroactively applied to those who have undergone transition, and it was determined that (say) 10% of them failed this test. It seems this would create a situation where there was a class of people who were deemed to be acceptable, and a second class who were somehow sick or wrong to have transitioned. Should I be prevented from transitioning if I failed the test?

So I instinctively reject the medical answer. That leaves me in an equally uncomfortable position where I don't have a good answer for the troll. Should I in fact be calling them a cat, and not questioning their identity? That seems kind of ultra-liberal and a bit ludicrous, that they should expect society to treat them like a cat. The parallel with me wanting people to think of me as something other than my birth-assigned gender is obvious.

I've kept it simple. In my opinion and in the opinion of my therapist, a coming out letter is no place to go into detail about the medical side of transition or the science behind being transgender. I hope this letter provides some help for those among you who will eventually have to write one of your own.]

Dear Mom and Dad,

This will not be a very easy letter for you to read and I know that what I’ve written here will change our relationship. I have confidence, however, that you will always love me no matter who I am or what I do. I am your only child and nothing can change that. What I need now more than ever is your understanding and support, realizing that what I’m going to tell you will require more of either than you probably ever imagined you’d have to give.

You know me. I’m a very positive, optimistic person. I have just about anything someone could want: an emerging career in a romantic field with exciting job prospects on the horizon; a circle of close friends; a beautiful, devoted wife; and loving parents who have provided me with everything I’ve needed to succeed. Nevertheless, for about the past twenty years I have hidden something about myself from you and everyone else at all costs. It’s overshadowed every achievement, every joy, haunted me every single day. To the detriment of my mental health I’ve done everything I can to suppress it and failed. As a result and despite how good I’ve become at masking my feelings, I have been very sad most of my life. I’ve only begun to finally feel some joy when I recently stopped suppressing and started facing the truth. 

I’m transgender. Perhaps you’ve never heard this term or you have and don’t know what it means or you have heard it and think you know what it means. None of these possibilities would surprise me, for on the rare occasions that transgenderism is discussed there’s typically a lot of prejudicial misinformation exchanged. “Transgender” is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity does not conform to the sex they were assigned at birth. In my case, it means that my brain is female and my body is male. It means that every day of my adolescent and adult life has been spent longing for something that I didn’t think I could ever have – a body to match the way I feel inside. I’ve woken up every morning with that thought on my mind; spent the day envious of the women around me; went to sleep praying that God would turn me female in the night; and wake up again the next morning disappointed. Truly, I don’t think you can imagine the agony that this mismatch has caused me.

You may be wondering why I haven’t mentioned this sooner. The truth is I hoped it would go away. When I was going through puberty, I figured that my preoccupation with being female was just a phase. I thought that by the time I got married surely this feeling would be a distant memory, and I desperately looked forward to that day. When that day did come, I still thought marriage would “cure” me. I remember standing in the shower that morning crying tears of joy and saying to myself, “It’s finally over.” But it’s almost 7 years later and my gender dysphoria has done nothing but amplify. 

I can’t keep living like this. All of my experiences to this point indicate that if I have a “choice” in how I proceed from here, it’s a choice between life and death. So I’ve already begun to take the necessary steps to live a congruent life. Telling you, my wonderful parents, is a big step in that direction, even if it’s the most difficult action I’ve ever taken.

At this point, I’d like to preempt and address some of the questions that this revelation has no doubt raised.

**Are you crazy?**
Transgenderism is a well-documented phenomenon affecting about 1 in 300 people. It originates in the womb. It does not qualify as a mental disorder, which is defined as a condition that, in and of itself, stunts a person’s ability to be happy and successful. It is society – not the mind – that inflicts hardship on transgender people like me who are forced to repress their true selves in the name of conformity. Many repress it their entire lives, leading to true mental disorders like depression and anxiety.

**What does this mean for your marriage?**
Lindsey was the first to know. I told her about 8 months ago. I would never have told her (or you, for that matter) if I were not 100% confident that I am, in fact, a woman in a man’s body. Though she shocked me with how well she took it, we nonetheless spent the next few months reestablishing the easy rapport that had existed between us. Prior to my confession, I had convinced myself that our marriage could not weather this storm. After countless conversations, she has shown me how wrong this prediction was. I now know that she loves my soul above all else. Who I am hasn’t changed. Regardless of how I proceed from here, she’s assured me over and over that she’s with me. If you’d like advice on how to move towards acceptance, understanding, and eventually celebration of my determination to move forward, she’s the person to talk to.

**How does this affect the prospect of grandchildren?**
Lindsey and I still want children and we want them soon. I expect you’ll have a bittersweet reaction to this news. On the one hand, I know you want grandchildren. On the other, you probably have some severe reservations about a couple such as us raising children. Here is my response to that. Lindsey and I will love our children no less than we love each other, which is to say, tremendously. Loving two-parent households, regardless of the gender of the parents, are a stable foundation for childrearing. Countless research in numerous cultural contexts has shown this to be true. I’d be happy to provide references.

**What will our friends/family think?**
Unfortunately we cannot control what other people think. If we could, I’d make you accept me as I am so that we can all get on with our lives. Some of your friends may understand but many won’t. One of my requests is that you keep this a family matter until you are 1) willing to stand up for me and 2) knowledgeable enough of transgender issues to mount an informed defense. Neither of you have ever had much of a problem standing up for what you believe in. I’m confident that, in time, you will be among my most valuable allies. This will require you to reevaluate many of your current attitudes. Keeping this between us will allow us to work through it together without outside negativity.

**How will this affect your career?**
I cannot imagine a better field in which to be transgender. Anthropologists embrace difference. Indeed, it is a matter of professional ethics. We know better than anyone else that while sex is biological, gender is cultural. Many societies today and in the past recognize third, fourth, fifth, and even sixth genders beyond male and female. A perspective such as mine can count in my favor on the job market, especially if I eventually wish to contribute to the long legacy of anthropological research on gender.

**Where did we go wrong?**
If your goal was to raise a child to be exactly like you, then I suppose you went wrong somewhere. But neither you nor I believe that this is the goal of parenting. From my admittedly limited perspective, the goal of parenting is to create a supportive and warm atmosphere at home, nurture the child’s interests, and instill positive values that will carry the child through every stage of life. You’ve done nothing wrong. To the contrary, you raised me to have the strength necessary to become the person that I know I am, even in the face of a larger society that will certainly reject me. Because of you, I have the confidence to face this challenge. You have been exemplary parents.

**What happens now?**
I am taking some medicine that over the course of the next several years will subtly feminize my appearance. Ultimately, I will transition to living as a woman full-time. There is a very good chance that I will eventually be able to blend in perfectly, but there will be hard days between now and then when I am ridiculed, criticized, scorned. For the most part, I really don’t care what my detractors think. I enter into this in-between stage fully knowledgeable of and prepared to deal with how broader society treats people like me. If you choose to provide it, your continued love and support will be a powerful buffer.

I know there will be more questions. Please feel free to ask them when you are ready to call or write, but I must insist that you *do not contact us until you have carefully considered what I’ve said and are ready to respond in a positive or at least neutral way.* Negative or angry words will only make this difficult situation much worse, potentially causing permanent damage. Please think very hard about the impact that your words will have on me. Choose them carefully.

We are clearly at a crossroads. I am not rejecting you; rather, I’m asking that you not reject me. That said, I expect that the forthcoming weeks and months will be very difficult ones for you as you adjust to this new dynamic. You have the right to mourn the loss of your son. However, you are gaining a daughter. My presentation will change and I’ll be happier, but I will remain the same person you’ve always known. You now just know a little more about me and I’ll finally be able to be myself around everyone who matters most to me.

I'm worried though; I've done as much research as I can on transitioning, what the effects are, and surgery aftercare specifics for when it's time for that, as well as local laws about srs insurance and trans* protection, but I'm hopelessly afraid of massively fucking up the day to day stuff. If I'm helping show her the area, how do I help her specifically find trans* friendly employers and businesses in general? If a friend or neighbor asks if she's trans*, I don't want to out her but I can't think how to answer without outing her (she used to sing bass in choir before so her voice is still a bit of a tell). Like as far as I can tell saying ""no"" might be the better option but ""it's her business"" seems like it might be better but also kind of outing her. What should I say? 

Basically, for the trans* women out there, what should I try to be extra aware of to be a good roommate and a good friend that's trans* specific and not just what I'd do for any friend? There are probably (definitely?) things I'm missing because none of my previous roommates were trans*!

But I'm curious as to what the EXACT changes are...

  I've got access to a 3D laser scanner, and I'm thinking about doing facial scans (maybe once a month?) of myself to actually track the exact changes that are going on as a result of HRT.

----------

  Does anyone know if this has been done?  Have I caught anyone's interest?

-----

  PS. I know some other early HRT or Pre-HRT trans people in the area that I might also see if they'd be interested in participating...

**Edit:** Anyone near Indy/Chicago?

----

----

**EDIT: ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION**
For any participants I get, I would ask for some additional data collection as well... some basic demographic and medical history would probably be a good idea...

Along with the monthly scans, I would probably also ask for:  **(COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY)**

* **Weight**
* **Height**
* **[The 7 'body measurements' found here](http://www.transgendercare.com/medical/resources/tmf_program/tmf_program_7.asp)**
* **Roughly what their exercise/fitness habits have been for the past month**
* **Roughly what their eating habits have been for the past month**
* **What there HRT regimine includes**
* **Maybe a couple photos too?**

Anything else I should ask for?

----------------

**Concerns...**

* To anyone worried about the legal/confidentiality issues that this might pose...  I know, this gets complicated...  I am going to try to meet next week with a research expert that I know... there's a lot of gray areas here...

* I'm toying with the idea of getting a thumb drive for each participant I wind up with.  Storing ALL of their data on there, and leaving the drive in their own possession (I would ask them to make 2 copies somewhere on their own system), at least until I actually get to the point of actually compiling data.  Informally, it seems like the simplest way to protect themselves.

* Anyone know of any grants I could apply for?  Is that even a good idea?  I'm close to wrapping up a degree, and I'm not sure what I'll be doing after...

So, today was stressful.. I had to give this presentation, so before that I went to this salon nearby to get my eyebrows plucked/waxed. It went fine, I like going to random places because random people always gender me correctly without staring or anything, so I like to think that I pass 100%. Alright, then I went to do my presentation and more people m'am'd me several times, it was even unusual cause people usually just don't say anything, Idk. So when it was time to present I had to identify myself by checking in with my university student card.. and that thing still has my male name in it because I hadn't yet come out in the university environment. So I slided the card through the magnetic thingie and a picture of old self + old name popped up on the event girl's screen and she was like ""Oh, I'm sorry, m'am, there must be some error.. Can you slide your card again?"" I made the most embarrassed face in the entire world and just did it again while trying to mumble ""It's fine.. just... "" and the same thing popped again. My teacher/boss then intervened and said that was correct (even though she knows about my new name etc. she's still very used to using old awful name.) I felt horribly embarrassed and exposed, even though it was just a couple people who witnessed that. Then a couple more random people who had to address me called me m'am ""could you sit over there and wait m'am?"" and that calmed me down, but I was feeling horrible and anxious because of the presentation that followed.

I presented really well. I know my stuff, and I know how to talk to an audience, even though I was actually physically shaking T_T. They were like ""oh you did well, bla bla"" but I just wanted to get the hell out of there. Then I went to my therapist and didn't even talk to her about it lol.. We ended up talking about happy things, and honestly I needed that, so it was good. Then on my way home a woman approached me like ""m'am do you know where I can take a bus downtown?"" I was so happy &lt;3 I helped her out as best I could even though I'm usually so disoriented.

I felt a bit awkward in the skirt (maybe it was just a bit short), and the top didn't really fit me. The makeup combined with hair made me sorta passable, but I think I still got read as male a lot. Not sure, nobody used pronouns the entire night. Anyway, after she left I went into a nearby coffee shop known for LGBT patrons, and went back into boy mode in the bathrooms.

I don't know if I just didn't like the clothes, or what. I've never like makeup, and probably never will, I just can't get behind it. I wasn't entirely satisfied with the top, but it looked ok and I don't think that's enough to destabilize my emotions.

The opposite happened, the night felt forced and awkward. I felt like I didn't pass, like I just looked like some stupid boy walking around in a damn skirt. Maybe I just feel terrible about the whole not passing thing.

Sitting in my car there, I felt like some fucked up abomination. Like something that just shouldn't have been. I contemplated killing myself seriously again for the first time since the friend in question agreed to help me do this. I felt wrong. I felt disgusting. I felt as if my gender identity was a joke, that it would never show through in my body. I felt like it wasn't real, like I would never truly know for sure if I'm trans, or just a stupid fucking kid willing to trick itself into thinking it's something else for attention.

Oh, I wasted 50 fucking dollars on some makeup and stupid fucking outfit I'm never going to wear again. Fuck that thing, it made me feel like an awkward showcased freak sideshow piece of shit. I think I'm going to burn it. But I like my name. My friends call me Amy, and use female pronouns. It's awesome, and it makes me feel good.

So it's my reddit cake day. I figured I should make a post to celebrate. 

Exactly one year ago today, I created a little account here. My hands were shaking. I was terrified. Choosing a username, I remembered a recent purchase and just ran with it. 

Then I was 23, single, just out of college, working at a job in a new city, and finally coming to terms with my gender identity. The post I made here 1 year ago was essentially the start of my transition, on March 28th, 2011. 

On that day I posted a confused ramble just looking for advice, support, and someone, anyone, to talk to about this. Then and since I've got so much support here I can't express what a blessing this place has been.

Following my ""submitted"" history is almost a timeline of my transition in and of itself, but here is how things went:

March 28th: After thinking about it for a long time, make the first terrifying step and post to /asktg. Am convinced to seek a therapist. This night, I also order my first ever female clothing, some underwear from amazon.com. A few days later, I order some estradiol and spiro from inhouse.

April: Start seeing a therapist. Debate between self-dosing and following standard therapy route. Eventually therapist informs me that he only offers hormones after a minimum of six months of therapy. 

Within a few weeks of talking to people, I was pretty set on giving hormones a try. In late April, the hormones I ordered from inhouse arrive. I start taking them on April 18th. I start to feel a little better about myself within a few days After a week on hormones online, I'm able to find an informed consent doc to prescribe me a legit estradiol and spiro Rx. The doc gives me a low dose of 1 mg estradiol, 100 spiro. Also, in April, first laser session.

Finally, in late April, I fly back home to my home state for Easter. During this weekend, I come out to my parents and brothers, thus beginning a a long family shit-storm which I won't go into unless asked. 

May: Sperm banking. I go on and off hormones (still a very low dose) as needed when making deposits. My gatekeeping therapist strongly disapproves of me taking hormones, keeps asking for the name of the doc I'm going to. I stop seeing him and start looking for someone else. Start getting involved in the Houston trans center.

June: continue hormones, still on a low dose. Find an awesome therapist who I still see regularly. I start developing my voice. It's extremely painful at first. If you want to see it, just look up youtube user ganymededawn. 

In June, I also meet someone truly special. She's genderqueer, amazingly fabulous, kind, handsome, an amazing cook. He's been there for me through the hardest, most painful parts of this transition. Don't know where I would be without her. She's my awesome boyfriend. :3 We've been together since June!

July: Meet my family again for fourth of July, the first time since Easter. By then, they've taken the liberty of outing me to my sisters for me. More family drama. I continue developing my voice, continue getting laser. I sheepishly come out to HR at work, begin to plan a workplace transition. In early July, I get a formal psych-approved recommendation for hormones, switch to a doctor more experienced with trans patients. Go to 8 mg estradiol and 100 spiro.

August-September: Things continue. More laser, more hormones. Really starting to see significant results. In August, start considering FFS. 

October: Switch to new doc, second doc didn't do blood work for some reason, didn't find it necessary. Start researching legal name changes. 

November: Everything continues. Through HR, I come out to my immediate coworkers. They're informed I will soon be going full-time female. I find a lawyer in my home state to begin a court order to change my name and legal sex. 

December: 6 month anniversary with my partner. We drive together and spend Christmas with my family. Much, much too much family drama. Laser/hormones continue. In the last week of December, the court approves my petition. I am now legally Tanya and legally female. 

January: I go full-time female. New year, new start. Start electrolysis to clean up hairs left behind by laser. Use court order to start changing documents, drivers license, social security agency, health insurance, banking info, etc. In January, firmly decide to do FFS and select a doc for it. Begin putting together finances.

February: hormones, electro continue. Get my final FFS date with Dr. DiMaggio in Buenos Aires. Have an awesome party celebrating my boyfriend's 24th birthday. Meet a whole bunch of fine folks on the queercraft minecraft server.

March: more of the same. Put last of finances together for FFS. Almost get a really awesome job at another company. Would have come with a huge pay increase, more interesting projects, etc. Job offer rescinded after I tell them I'm trans. (They didn't realize during the interview.) Make this post commemorating the date.
And to come:

April 15th, 2012: fly out for FFS
April 18th, 2012: one year hormone anniversary
April 19th, 2012: Surgery date

So yeah, it's been a wild year. It's easily been the most rapid period of change in my entire life. It's been quite the ride. It certainly hasn't been easy. At times it's been incredibly frustrating, emotionally traumatic, financially draining, physically painful, and a dozen other things. At the same time, it's been wonderful, joyous, and made me really start to feel like myself for the first time in my life. 

I suppose I should post some photos. 

Here are some current ones:

Sorry they're a bit rough. I need to do my eyebrows again, my hair's a mess, I'm not wearing makeup, and I even have hair grown out for electro. This post is a bit of a last-minute thing, these are just some pics I snapped now. The last pic is from early march and is what I look like shaved, some makeup on, and decent hair.

And finally, for the obligatory scary guy pics: http://imgur.com/a/eGC3s#0  These are from July 2010. I'm on a horse.  This last one: http://imgur.com/zNdxB is from March 2011. 

So yeah, that's the year in review. Obviously this is just a summary, but I could write all day about what's happened in the last year. I just want to say thanks for all the help. This board has been a wonderful source for information, inspiration, and friendship. I just want to say wherever you are in your journey, keep at it. You can get there. It's a long, hard road, but the destination is definitely worth it!

I started early, with a supporting family, and am generally assumed to be cis by everyone I know. That said in light of the recent birth of r/Transpassing I am prompted to write such scattered thoughts to the trans community on neuroticism and envy.

“What does she have that I don’t?” from even before my transition, and probably the transitions of many other trans people, this is one of the most pervasive thoughts I had. Looking at other girls who were pretty and wondering what makes them and me so different. These thoughts and observations left me with prevailing feelings of ideal beauty, reinforced by the media, an image that definitely not me. So even after I started ‘full-timing’ I was not sure I ‘passed’(1), and even if I did ‘pass’ I was certain I was ugly and not worth noting. I was constantly obsessed with my appearance, mirrors who were my enemies up until a few weeks before were now my greatest friends. I would not be surprised if almost all trans people have similar feelings.

This neuroticism about my appearance lead to a need for gratification, but it was gratification in the most twisted sense. I was mistrustful of my friends who said I was pretty, and unable to obtain the opinions of unbiased strangers. Essentially anyone who would tell me something that went against my thought of idealized beauty did not have a valid opinion to me and I found myself in a cycle of negative reinforcement. I was ugly, therefor anyone who said I was pretty was lying to make me feel better, therefor I was ugly. It took me several years until I managed to beat the cycle and realise that my opinion was entirely incorrect.

So my view of beauty, like many trans peoples, is probably the view of the standard yet beautiful girl. Someone who is not too tall with very mild features; a small upturned nose, big eyes and a petit chin. Which leaves me the 5’9.5” girl with a prominent nose in a right state. I was convinced because I was not like the average that I was abnormal, masculine and unattractive.

Now my situation gets rather ideal at this point, several circumstances came around to prove me that I was wrong. One night I went clubbing with two of my close cis friends, friends who I thought were the idealized beauty I convinced myself of. On this night of drinking and dancing and poor decisions I observed that men we mutually found attractive would gravitate towards me rather than my friends. It was that night that I truly realised that people tend to find the average boring and bland, where as my face and height were both worthy of note and made me a more interesting and attractive person. Height as an example, is something that many trans women fear but most cis women covet.

The point of my rant isn’t that we are all attractive, or that I am attractive and you aren’t, it is that your view of beauty and especially of yourself is inherently warped. No amount of outside reinforcement is going to change your sense of self; it is something that you have to overcome on your own. I had a catalyst to overcome this feeling but in the end it was on me to realise that I had made a flawed assumption of beauty and femininity. Girls come in all shapes and sizes and most trans women can count themselves in to those shapes and those sizes. Looking at other people and forming opinions of beauty around them is just going to dash your own self-confidence, self confidence that won’t be gained back until you realise that your envy does nothing.

Even if you don’t look cis, even if you aren’t pretty, that is no excuse to waste away your self-confidence by envying others. Build your self confidence on your own and stop comparing yourselves to others. Loving yourself should be independent of other people. Confidence, not external gratification is probably the best deterrent of suicidality and self-doubt. If you help yourself and your confidence you may realise that everything else will come to you.

I hope that some people find that they can get something out of my ramblings and it did not come off as too preachy, my experiences are obviously not everyones. I don't feel like relying on other people for happiness will get you anywhere and if you open yourself up like that and get shut down you will be hurt way more than you should.

My older brother (who is 18) consistently called her 'it' and called her a 'disgusting transvestite', provoking no response from my parents. All of them are very liberal, my Dad being a Liberal Democrat and my Mum and brother being Labour. They all strongly oppose things like homophobia and sexism, so it was quite a shock for me when I heard them being so openly transphobic.

I am now extremely nervous about coming out to my family; where previously I was confident they would be accepting and stand up for me (but still nervous), I am now very worried that they will react badly indeed. Did anyone else have experiences like this where liberal family members reacted unexpectedly? I was thinking about coming out at some point between now and christmas, but now I am a lot more unsure of this. I am also worried that recently I have been under a lot of stress mentally because of this whole thing, and that I may end up having some sort of breakdown.

Anyway, I just finished it. It's a *sledgehammer* of a book.

Not only does she do an amazing job of encapsulating a lot of challenging topics, but she does it with such an amazing precision of language and such a profound rhetoric that I found myself, at many points in the book, gawking at her brilliance. At the beginning of the book she gave the caveat that her main focus was going to be trans-misogyny, and I was worried that the book was just going to be an invective against *discriminators*, but instead she geniusly framed gender, sex, and society in rational and meaningful ways to give an invective into the many and often subtle ways we are *discriminatory*. Her insight was powerful: I was able to see a lot of my own hidden prejudices come to light without feeling like she was indicting me for being a terrible oppressor, and, moreso than anything else I've read, I feel like it gave me a genuine window into the trans experience.

http://static.tumblr.com/5pimtym/tRxlzpch8/tegan-quin-gif-tegan-and-sara-17405226-400-224.gif

My partner was a total hearthrob who asked me to dance with her at a queer party. We danced rather closely for quite some time and then took a break. I got the impression she had read me as trans since (a) she had already felt up my pretty ridiculously small boobs and (b) at least half the people at the party were trans.

I decided just to go for it:
""So, do you like girls like me?"" I asked.
http://coedmagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/kate13.jpg
(okay, I know that's not a gif, but that was pretty much my facial expresion, minus the bird).

To which she replied, simply,
""I like girls. You're a girl.""

""I mean, I'm trans."" I said, ""Is that okay with you?""

And she just said,
""I don't care; I think you're cute.""

And that's pretty much how things happened.

(Oh yeah, and also she compared my boobs to Katherine Moennig's, which is by far the best celebrity comparison compliment ever.)

It was the first time I've had sex since I started identifying/living as a lady. She was so kind and sweet, and considerate and managed to make me feel so incredibly sexy and safe at the same time. It was pretty amazing.

I love the fact it makes me more emotional and makes me ""feel"" at all. I love
that it shrinks things down there and I love the fact I don't get random boners or 
boners ever unless I want to. Oh and how I love that it gives me smooth soft skin
and how my face feels without stubble. 


I love the way my thighs got fat and of course my boobs, o gaad I love my boobs. I love
having a hairless body. I love how happy I am all the time rather than that sullen and 
angry feeling from before. I love that I feel content. 


I love doing simple girl things like taking a warm bath, painting my toe nails, searching for
just the right shoes or spending hours trying on new outfits while mixing and matching to 
find my style. 


And I love that feeling I get when people see me as my true gender or when a guy give me a
second look. Or a random girl on the streets tells me she likes my shoes and then stops to chat. It's
like a warm hug that lasts all day. In short I love everything about being a woman. 


But I'm conflicted, is it possible that ANY male would feel like this taking Estrogen? 
Is it possible that Estogen has tricked us/me into feeling good about all these
things? Is it just a ""happy"" drug that works for everyone TS or not? 

I guess it does not matter but I sometimes think I'm fooling myself. I'd never go back but I
can't help but wonder, is this real? It's almost like I'm not worthy of being so happy.  Am

* Where do you see yourself in 10 years time? Is it a happy thought? Would that image be improved if you were living comfortably as your desired sex? A trans*person of your desired sex?
* If one magic pill changes you to a naturally-born person of your desired sex and the other takes away these feelings, which do you take? Why?
* If you were to wake up tomorrow with the body of your desired sex as if you had been born that way, how would you feel? In a month? Year? Decade?
* If you were to wake up tomorrow 3 years post-transition, any surgeries or changes you desire completed, hormones taken full hold, a full wardrobe, etc., how would you feel? Month? Year? Decade?
* Would you rather be a rich, successful, attractive person of your current sex, or an average person of your desired sex?
* Married with kids... Husband or wife? Mom or dad?
* Which sex would you prefer to live as on an island by yourself? Alone with Family? Friends? Strangers?
* What do you think will change if you transition (personality, mood, behavior), and why?
* Do you think these feelings are rooted in your true nature, sociocultural norms, observations of reactions to your natural expression?
* Name 3 good reasons you might not be trans. Now name 3 good reasons you might be trans.
* Do you want to be cis or trans?
* How would you feel if you saw a therapist and they told you that you were trans? How about if they said they could tell you really were trans?
* Is family/friends the only thing stopping you from transition?
* If you could push a button and be a cis version of the gender in question, would you?
* Do you want to be trans? If so, why?
* You're struggling to answer if you're trans or not, how do you want the struggle to end?
* What does it mean to me to be a man or a woman?
* If I had a test you could take that generally pretty accurately guessed the taker's gender, and you were to take it, which answer would you be hoping it gave you?
* If I had a test that could tell you with 100% certainty whether or not you were trans, and you took it, and the result came back ""Well, you're not really trans, you just have some mild gender confusion, and you really shouldn't transition"", how would that make you feel? (If the answer is anything like ""disappointed"", ""upset"", etc., that might be a sign... so might ""relieved"".)

His biological father will absolutely not be and I doubt many kids in the neighborhood will just ignore it.   How do I prepare him for the harshness that will inevitably come his way?  As a community who has gone through this, would you have preferred your parents to protect you or do I just prepare myself to patch up his little heart as need be?

She's probably the most real person I've ever talked to...and we spend every waking moment together, just about. However this isn't without it's problems.

She currently lives at home and is in the beginning stages of trying to get HRT treatment but hasn't started. She's seeing a therapist trying to have it done, but there have been a lot of obstacles for her - and they seem to just get worse and worse.

Her family isn't behind her at all in this, and even though her mom takes her shopping for girl clothes and has even gotten her a girl hair cut - she won't support HRT and every time it gets brought up will become upset. This of course sends my girlfriend into a huge bout of depression and sadness. She also receives this type of reaction from her grandparents (whom she lives with) that tell her she's brainwashed by people online and that this will pass.

Today she laid in bed crying all day. Truly nobody in her family understands what she's going through. I am there with her as much as I can be when she's like this, but I feel like I have no clue what to say to try and make her feel better. I want her to be optimistic about the future and how once she's old enough her and I can move out together and life will be good - but it doesn't help. I can't find the words to say - are there words to say? I don't know...

So, as I recently posted, I came out to two of my close friends recently. They were wonderful, and excited at the prospect of me becoming their new girlfriend, and were touched that I trusted them enough to tell then first. 

Today, I took the next step; I told my work.

For some context, I work in retail, and my company is wonderfully accepting of all people. In fact, one of my friends recently went through a full FtM transition, while employed there. 

I sat down with my HR manager, someone who has always helped me, and in the past saved my life from going down horrible paths of self-destruction. I didn't know quite how to start, so just came out with it.

I cannot express how incredible this woman was. She didn't change how she looked at me. She didn't question ""Are you sure"", ""Why is it you feel like this"". She let me talk, she told me she would research ways they'd help me with the medical side potentially, and gave me the most wonderful hug. 

She has been my aspiration in terms of where I want my career to go for a long time, and today I feel like I may have found one of my best friends I'll ever make.

I wanted to post this as something that could hopefully inspire and encourage others who are worried about coming out at work. I know the fear, that knot in your stomach. I had it. I don't now. I walked out of her office, and the world looked like it was in colour for the first time. I'd crossed one of my biggest hurdles. 

I still need to tell my parents, but I feel more confident now, than I ever did before.

I just... I can't see myself. In photos, sure there's progress. In person? Every day I see him in my reflection... It's killing me.

On a daily basis, I have some really hurtful and fucked up thoughts. I just distract myself so it doesn't hurt so bad. Today I couldn't. From 4am until 8pm I was in bed. I crawled out to get a bite after my brother convinced me. After that I pretended to function as a distraction around him and his family, who I live with. Now I can't sleep because of my mind wont fuck off.

I was really suicidal and depressed for a long time, HRT lessened that and it went away for a few months actually. Now it's just back with a vengeance and I really don't care to get out of bed anymore. I'm cripplingly lonely, horribly disgusted by the mirror/my body, and overall don't control my thoughts. 

Everyone sees me and tell me I look so happy and so photogenic and overall not a miserable piece of shit. But ultimately, I'm faking it all. Every day, no matter who I'm near. I still just want to curl up and cease to be. I try to force myself not to feel that way everyday, and I'd never act on these horrible thoughts I think. If I wouldn't be found by an immediate family member, I fear I'm not so sure...

It just hurts. I hurt. I just want it to stop. I explain all this to my very few friends and family. All I get in return is a ""It'll get better"" which drives me crazy. I don't want a solution to my problems, but I definitely don't want a cliche answer such as ""It'll get better"" because it obviously won't for the immediate future. To me it's them just writing me off. ""Oh you hurt? Yeah, it'll get better. I don't really care.""

Due to money, I had to cut back on therapy as much. Once a week individiuals became once a month. But I still go to a support group. But I don't want to be the downer, and talk about my problems with them. With anyone, in person. If they really know how I feel they'd just judge and pity me.

Tl;Dr - I know this is cliche and I'm really, terribly sorry... How do you make it hurt less? I've been on HRT for just shy of 7 months and it's a week 'til my 23rd birthday.

I have worked on my voice for SO. LONG. Over a YEAR. For a while I was practicing it several hours a day, every day, and I thought I had a voice that was acceptable. I asked around here and got good opinions on it, and asked my family what they thought. Everyone sugarcoated it and told me my voice sounded just fine.

Then I go online and use it and get made fun of. People interrupt me when talking and tell me that I'm obviously not a girl. I go on another trans forum that isn't as ""nice"" (I don't think lying to people really is nice) and get told I essentially sound like an effeminate gay guy.

I just had to tell someone.,,34,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/192vxp/i_just_realised_that_my_father_will_die_having/,"Some of you may have seen me floating around here before. I've not participated overmuch, mostly because you wonderful people always speak my thoughts perfectly, so I don't need to :P but I do see you all as my extended community. You all seem really caring and wonderful, and helpful. I don't really know how this could be helped, though, so apologise in advance for what is mostly a sad kind of rant.

I've been living full time as male since late 2010, and out to my parents since early 2011, so they've known for about two years now. I've been on hormones for a year - I've got a beard, deep voice and a binder on all the time, and I fairly obviously/confidently express as male (for me personally - totally not trying to enforce stereotypes or anything.) 

Mum's first reaction was to inform me I had no right to expect they would even try to get male pronouns and my new name right, and my father insisted I was selfish for 'changing' the child they had known my whole life. Mum makes token attempts now, but my dad has never once used the right pronoun or name.

He was diagnosed with prostate cancer around 5 years back, and we thought his surgery and radiation treatment had beaten it back considerably. We were wrong. It's gotten into his bones, and now his liver. My mother is fairly sure he won't live to see next year. 

I want to be there for him as any good kid would - he's a nice guy, but very limited in his experience of anything political/subculture/queer identities, and it shows. It's painful to me to spend time with the people who should care the most, who appear to support me the least. But I wonder if I'm being incredibly selfish, seeing as it's dad's time of need. I don't know. I just realised that he's going to die having never recognised me as his son, or treated me as such. He's probably never even going to use the right name or pronouns. I know it's not that important in the grand scheme of things, but best case scenario, being with him for his remaining time is going to set off major anxious and depressive issues I have. Again, I know that sounds selfish. I hate myself for it, even though I know my feelings are legitimate. I'm going to miss him. I do love him. I'm just really scared that a really little part of me is always going to resent him for refusing to respect or understand my identity. I realise that may make me an asshole, but maybe not. I don't know.

Thanks for listening, all.

Edit: So I've decided to share a bit more about what's happened in the past with my family. I should probably make a separate post for all this (there's a fair bit) but I didn't want to clog up the page with related posts. I hope someone reads this - it's all just coming out at once, and I needed to say it at least once before trying to resolve anything with a therapist). Thanks for reading, in advance.

I spent most of 2011 in an abusive relationship. Emotional, physical violence- they were supportive of my identity, being queer themselves, but our problems arose from issues other than my being trans. When we broke up (I got sick of the condescension and splashed a drink in their face - they'd punched me before, out of 'reflex' but also when we wrestled or if I startled them - never apologised). They are powerful and well known in the queer community, and told everyone they could that I was the violently abusive one. I lost most of my friends, and a lot of the older queers I looked up to told me I needed to be fixed, and was an abuser. The ex admitted none of the things they did. I owned my outburst and apologised. Long story short, I ended up staying back at my parents' house for about two months at the start of 2012 because I lacked the finances to move out right away. My parents wanted to help out, let me stay, all that material stuff. My mother has said on multiple occasions that 'demand' (her word) that they use the right name/pronoun is selfish and that I shouldn't expect it - they'll get it when they were ready. I accepted, needing anywhere to stay. One evening, my dad and brother and I were playing a board game. Dad has a temper - yelled at my brother for playing on his phone. This went on for about ten minutes, just him being aggressive and easily angered - I went to leave, because I had anxiety issues related to aggressive situations. He asked why, I said I was uncomfortable being around angry powerful people, and he yelled at me for telling him what to do in his house. Called me a girl, I reminded him I wasn't - what followed was ten minutes of him screaming in my face, telling me I was a thing, that I couldn't tell him what to do, that I was a thing, that he wasn't transphobic and that I was full of shit, that 'he'd decide what I was in his house' (friends have used the right name in front of him and he would angrily tell them to use my birth name before(, and other abuse. At one point he shoved me into a wall, tried to choke me. Threw half my shit on the street, told me to leave the house, wouldn't let me get the rest of it. Mum told me off for making him angry, and while I went back a couple days of couch surfing later, I never got an apology from either. 

At another time, my mother has accused me of being selfish because I wished to play a video game I had bought myself as a consolation 'escapism', I guess, after dealing with the traumatic breakup from my ex before my brother did - I just wanted to have it to myself for the first little while. She said it was no wonder my ex was abusive - I told her that she had no right to comment on that, and she told me I deserved it because I was clearly a horrible person. She never apologised.

Dad has shrugged before when I brought up the issue of abuse after I was almost bashed by a homophobic asshole at a friend's gathering - he said that I was selfish for not telling them about it right away, and that physical violence was serious - I reminded him about his cavalier attitude towards my stories of abuse previously, and he said it wasn't as concrete or as bad. My mother twisted the issue to be all about her and my dad, and when I said I hadn't told her about the attack because I wasn't sure how they'd react (couldn't deal with them suggesting it was my fault, as they have for most times I told them someone had mistreated me in my life, childhood and all), and she cried, telling me that I clearly hated them, and implied that I was an ungrateful and deluded person.

I'm sorry for ranting about all this. I'm just now starting to process this all, and I hope someone reads this.

I have a few questions.""",throwawaytransboyadv,32,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/wkvdu/update_i_kissed_a_transgender_boy_tonight_i_have/,"So, the wonderful boy took me out on a date today. We played glow-in-the-dark mini-golf and then spent about four or five hours just chatting in a coffee shop. He refused to let me pay for anything. It was honestly one of the sweetest things ever. He's so incredibly polite and he was so open about his past (he had a history of drug abuse, etc.). We talked a long time about gender. I found out he binds his chest, but he has a very small chest in the first place. However, he's getting a mastectomy in a few months. So, I believe he is non-op, as far as genitalia are concerned. Honestly, the female form doesn't gross me out or anything; I'm really not adverse to him having different genitals than I am used to. 

I had a ton of fun, but we both realize that a relationship doesn't make sense with me moving away for college. We are still going to hang out and we still kissed at the end of our hanging out today. He's so cute in that he asks me if it's okay to kiss me every time before he kisses me. He seemed nervous that I wouldn't want to see him again, and I think it has to do with the fact that many cisgender individuals don't give transgender ones a fighting chance for a relationship. 

I plan on making the most of the next few weeks. Whether or not anything sexual happens makes no difference to me, he just makes me happy to be around and I'm having fun for the time being. He seemed really happy that I was so open about the idea of dating a transman. He said that he would be hesitant to be with a non-op transwoman (he's bisexual), because it'd be foreign to him and he'd be afraid of making her dysphoric and wouldn't be sure exactly what to do with her genitals, etc. So I think it's awesome that he's so understanding, but I really do like him and I am sure that the upcoming weeks will be fantastic, whether or not anything comes of this. Thank you all for your amazing advice! It was great help, but what helped most of all was really just sitting down and talking with him for hours at the coffee shop. We both figured out exactly where we stand and we were able to quite openly talk about our feelings. :)

EDIT: We've also talked and he seems a bit worried that if we were to hypothetically end up trying something sexual, that it'd be difficult if I ended up not being able to be turned on, since he already feels quite dysphoric. I told him there are millions of guys out there and if we end up not being compatible, I promise there are plenty of guys who will be. I still am very open to trying it because I'm very attracted to him and I doubt that'll change because of his genitals.

(update from coming out to my mom),Tina_Rayne,38,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/q6tmg/so_my_sisters_found_out_and_update_from_coming/,"[Original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/pwp8y/i_came_out_to_my_mom_a_few_days_ago/)

Along with my constant email battle I've had with my mom, I told her a few other things she didn't know about me like how I was actually an atheist. She took it fine but still wasn't budging on any form of acceptance towards me being transgendered. So I facebook my sister (who was the only person who knew that I was an atheist) and said that it was out and mom knew now. She thought it wasn't a big deal but, I don't know, I kind of just went on a rant about how mom had no intention of accepting me and how she would prefer I just lie to her for the sake of family appearances. I kind of played it off like it was a religious squabble, but my mom was actually pretty understanding in that area and I needed to vent my frustration. 

So, as it turns out, both of my sisters went to go see my mom a few days later (unknown to me) and brought up how she wasn't being understanding at all of me (they kind of forgot to mention the religious part). Mom broke down in the middle of a restaurant and both of my sisters were confused because religion wasn't too big of a deal growing up in our household. 

&gt; ""Mom, it's just religion. It's not that big of a deal.""'

&gt; ""What are you talking about?""

So skip a little context and now my sisters know.

***AND THEY'RE THE BEST SISTERS EVER!!!!***

From helping mom get over her grief, to buying books to be more educated, pushing mom to finally go to a PFLAG meeting, wanting to go to PFLAG themselves, wanting to buy me new christmas presents because the last ones sucked (their words, not mine), wanting to come down for a few days and visiting me just to hang out as sisters, using proper pronouns and calling me sis, possibly get a pedicure, and showing the most love and support I always wished I would get from them.

I was literally rolling around on the ground grinning from ear to ear I was so happy. 

It's just quite a breath of fresh air compared to a few weeks ago, their reaction was totally different than my moms. I almost don't know how to react. I mean, ya I'm on my way to womanhood, but I'm not presenting EVER, I don't look very feminine at all, my girls voice is atrocious and needs help, and I don't know. I want to do all these things with my sisters but my body just isn't right yet.  I'm probably just making excuses and need to just go have fun, but it's going to be my first outing with people who want to see the REAL me and I'm just not comfortable yet. Basically I've been on 9 months of medical transition and I'm still at the starting line of social transition and if you know my situation, you would know that it would be dangerous for me to move too fast in that area.

***tl;dr: worrying and my laziness for social transitioning aside, my sisters are the best damn sisters ever and I love them.***

 A little while ago, someone mentioned that trans women needed gynecological checkups after surgery; so does this mean that neo-vaginas are susceptible to the same diseases as natal vaginas? Can trans women get yeast infections, bacterial vaginosis, all that fun stuff? Do neo-vaginas develop the same or similar bacterial flora as natal vaginas over time?

 Also, would the physical changes that occur in a trans man's genitalia during HRT make him less vulnerable to these sorts of infections and give him genital flora more like that of cis men?

Long, sad post",genderantula,36,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1j55vm/my_turn_long_sad_post/,"So when I was four, my dad took me aside and told me that I was a boy. That he and my mother had put up with a lot, and I was about to start school, and if I didn't start acting like a boy I would get made fun of. In retrospect, I feel like part of that is that HE didn't want to get made fun of (it was a very small town), but whatev.

Over the years, this meant very different things to me. I was raised a southern baptist, and at first I thought it was the influence of some unknowable devil, attempting to claim me from an equally unknowable god. So I renounced my religion at age 12. Shortly thereafter, I came to understand it as a sexual thing, important to conceal but ultimately harmless.

Things got more complicated as I discovered that I didn't enjoy heterosexual sex; more often then not, I would just fake an orgasm and end up in the bathroom, crying while the faucet ran. I came to understand that, as much as I desired them, sex and relationships with other people were not for me.

Over the next several years (I'm 28 now), I tried to make the best of it. I privately explored and indulged my gender issues. By the age of 25, I understood that I was either going to come out and transition (terrifying!) or else kill myself first. I presumed the latter, and figured I would just do my best until then.

Well, last year I kinda got to that point and decided not to kill myself. So here we are now. I've come out to everyone I care about, I quit smoking, I quit drinking, I've lost 60+ pounds and I'm about to start HRT. Yay.

When I was closeted, I felt so alone. I was a child and I couldn't believe my parents when they said they loved me. Because they didn't really know me, and because I felt like they wouldn't love me if they did. That goes ditto for each and every friend I ever had. I thought coming out would fix things: everything on the table, all love legitimate, etc.

Well, I've never felt so alone. I can no longer relate to any of my straight friends (nor them to me), and I don't really fit in with any of the trans folk I've met since coming out. And you can just forget cis girls. My dad says he can't stand to look at me anymore, and he's all the family I have (mom died of ALS several years ago). All I did was shave my beard and get my eyebrows done! But then, sometimes I paint my nails and so I can totally understand if the closest thing I have to a support system feels the need to undermine me at every turn.

The trans dude at the clinic I'm going to mentioned an organization through which I could get cheap therapy with a gender specialist. At the time, I was like, ""Lone wolf walks alone,"" or some such shit, but about a month ago I sent him an email saying that I'd changed my mind and I really needed someone to talk to. No response. So I called the organization he had mentioned myself, asked for a gender person and finally had my first appointment a few days ago. It is incredibly apparent that I'm the first trans person she's ever met, let alone the first she's ever treated. So cool. I got to teach Trans 101 for the assteenth time, and I paid money for the privilege of doing so.

I don't know. Unless something was horrifically wrong with my blood work, I start HRT on Monday. But I already feel this awful on testosterone, what will estrogen do to me? Will I just cry myself to death? I've noticed other /asktrans posters note that they're just sending these sorts of things out into the void, and I suppose that's what I'm doing here.

Advice?,tgthrowaway123,37,8,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1ef9jo/im_fairly_sure_im_transgendered_but_i_dont_feel/,"I'll give the **TL;DR** first. I think I would rather be a girl than a boy, but I don't feel like shit. 

**Background**: I'm 16, thought about being transgendered at 14, threw it away because I got a girlfriend, now it's resurfacing (still have girlfriend)

It's entirely possible that my perception is wrong, but it seems to me that most trans people have very very strong feelings about being trans. I don't feel so strongly that I can't concentrate, I can do schoolwork fine, and the feeling doesn't take over my life. However, more often than not when I look at a girl, I wish I could be more like her. I find myself wanting to wear girls' clothes, and wanting long hair, wanting to wear makeup, etc. 

The problem is, it just feels weird. I'm very hesitant to deal with it socially. I feel like if I wasn't going to school and didn't already have friends (and more importantly, an large number of people that I'm acquainted with but don't talk to) then I would totally go through with it. It's very hard to separate my actual feelings from social considerations.

I guess what I'm looking for is some advice. I know that in the end only I can make the decision, but I could use some help. There are sometimes when I badly want to be a girl, but I can supress those feelings if I need to concentrate. I am worried that my feelings aren't strong enough and that if I start transition I'd have second thoughts almost immediately. Also, when I read transgenered forums it tends to make me feel more strongly, but if I stay away from it for a few days it dies down.

Thank you.

EDIT: One more thing I wanted to add was that, being a teenage boy, I think about sex quite often, and it's very hard to separate my jealousy of girls from the sexual side. I see the curves and I want them, but what if it's just me thinking about sex?

Second, I have hit a problem with my doctor and I just want to know if there is any truth to what he is saying.

Here is some background info if you need it.
I am trans-female
I've attempted DIY transitioning for a year, before seeking the approval of a psychologist, and the help of a HRT doctor. I was having trouble paying for the large cost of buying hormones online, and would have to miss a whole month of my medications when I could not handle the costs.

I found out my new insurance will cover these costs, so 6 months ago as of today is when I went through the proper procedure for hormone prescription. When I saw my doctor 6 months ago, he said he wanted to do things slow. He gave his speech about how many people ""think"" they're transgender but later regret their decision, despite my telling him I've been attempting HRT for a year now, and have carefully considered transitioning for 6 years now. Then he put me on 100mg Spironolact x2 daily, and 1mg estradiol once daily. Then as I left he said he'd see me in 6 months..

I thought ""Ok fine, I understand his worries. I've waited a long time I can wait another 6 months"". 

So it's been 6 months now, I just got back from my appointment today and he told me the following..

* He would never increase the estradiol I'm taking, the max anyone should ever take is 2mg a day. Any more is completely unsafe and should never be prescribed.

* 1mg is what is given to women on menopause because that is how much is needed for anyone to get the same estrogen levels of a female, without the use of female organs. That is why I should only remain on 1mg. (I asked for at the least 4mg)

* Blood tests are useless and not needed (I have not received a blood test order from this doctor yet) because it only shows my hormone levels, it doesn't show how much my receptors are taking in, and because I am only taking 1mg he already knows where my estrogen level is at.

I already think I will be getting a new doctor, but my questions are,

* Is it really that hazardous to take more than 2mg?
* Does what he says about blood tests hold any truth?
* Is it even possible to reach female estrogen levels off of 1mg for a male body?

My doctor sounded pretty creditable when he talked about this, and seemed incredibly sure about it, I'm just wondering where he got his sources, though I'm sure he may be very mislead.

Also, my love and partner (who is a nurse) has a slight concern about estrogen substantially lowing life expectancy, though she is still fully supportive and wants me to do what makes me happiest and myself. Anyways, I was wondering Does anyone know anything about shortened life expectancy on hrt, especially for transgenders?

Thank you so much for your time and read, I really hope someone out there can help me out with these questions!
Please share anything you may know, thank you for any responses!

The only time that I'm wearing guy clothes is when I wear a polo to work. Other than that, I don't really have much to do with masculine clothes anymore.

 About 3 weeks ago I began my first laser session and since have seen my hair grows much slower. I noticed that just one session has made my hair grow a tad slower, so I can retain femininity longer. Lately I have gotten urges to wear makeup, I started with just a little mascara every day. Before this I didn't really feel like wearing any foundation because my hair would grow out and it would look wrong. Now that I can I wear foundation with some mascara everyday, if not then every other day.  At this point I became slightly more confident, said fuck it and bought some eyeliner. Now I added that to my daily routine.  I'd say that I'm now in the androgynous category leaning very far into feminine, excluding my voice.

Here are some things that he told me, some of which go against the ""conventional wisdom"" I have gotten from the internet.
This is all MTF specific, sorry ftms :(

1) Spiro is a VERY safe drug. It has been widely used since the 60's for blood pressure. The ONLY verified side effect is that ""if you are prone to heart disease and you take spiro, you live slightly longer"". There is zero evidence that it effects your liver or other internal organs negatively. EDIT There are some minor side effects (increases need to urinate and one large risk, of higher potassium. The potasium risk can be controled via diet, so it is not a ""side effect"" per se EDN_EDIT 

2)  EDIT: Sorry, this was aimed at long term effects. Like what happends when someone that started 15 turns 60, or 70. END_EDIT 
No one has studied trans women and the effect of HRT, so anyone that makes a medical claim that some drug can do X or Y probably has zero basis for their claims. Almost all the data gathered on HRT in in post menopausal women. Any claims to absolute truth about effects on trans women are false.

3) Premarin works just as well as Estradiol for feminization. Premarin is generally easier to find in pharmacies so it was prescribed more. Estradiol is MUCH cheaper and so my doc now prescribes that. Again, there have been no studies done, so anyone claiming that one works better than the other is 100% making it up.

3) one group will tell you Premarin is ""linked at animal crulety"" and the other will tell that estradiol is ""an unnatural chemical"". They are both very biased. For me I would rather pay 10$ then 50$ so estradiol it is. 

4) Spiro lowers both T and E. The male range for E is actually almost the same as women. Mostly we take E to counter the effects of the spiro and to bring it up ""a tiny bit"".

5) There is no link between any particular part of HRT and risk of blood clotting (except smoking, DONT SMOKE). My Dr's theory is that clotting is most likely caused by incorrect dosing. EDIT to be clear, HRT comes with risk of clots, but we dont know what factors increase or decrease that risk. There is no evidence that any particular type of E , way of taking E or anything else has a measurable difference in clot risk END_EDIT.

6) Neither Spiro or E pills are ""hard on the liver"" that's total internet myth. The only risk of liver damage comes from clots. 

7) Pills (and patches) are better for you E levels then shots. Shots product a large spike and then a dip, this is worse for development. EDIT there is a BS call on this one, and I have to agree, I cant provide evidence to back it up. That being said this came from a doctor with decades of treating MTFs and FTMs, so it comes with a little more weight then 1 persons experience. Still, this should be treated as not verified EDN_EDIT 


8) any amount of breast growth is potentially permanent, so it would be sufficient to get a letter to change gender on documents.

9) the federal government is the easiest place to change you gender, mostly because no one has ever thought to put laws into place to block it. ",,False,,t5_2r4b9,1364221810.0,,,True,t3_1aqu2z,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1aqu2z/info_my_trans_endo_told_me/,

I will post a new thread as a reminder maybe once a month or so just in case people forget and so new users can also see my progress :)**

I've been on HRT for just over 2 years, and in that time span I've had several periods where basically nothing was happening. The first half a year, I got the basic stuff like soft skin and breast buds. The next half a year, my breasts got to about tanner stage 2 or so, my face changed a little bit and that was about it.

1 year to 1.5 years was probably the biggest let down so far, I had barely any development at all. I was struggling to get my testosterone levels to go down with Spironolactone, so at around the 1.5 year mark, I switched to cyproterone acetate (Siterone from IHP) and it nuked my T levels within a week, with profound effects on my sex drive and sexual function.

Within a few months of switching to CPA, I started noticing very rapid facial changes and I also had a small growth spurt in my breasts, but nothing crazy. From 1.5 to 2 years, I noticed a change in my body shape - I have a lot more fat in my thighs/hips and on my butt now. I also put on weight in the last few months, but all of it went to my lower body and none of it went to my breasts, which really sucked.

So far, I am very happy with my results, except for one thing - my breasts. They still look very pubescent - they are conical in shape, my nipple and areola are very puffy which makes them look odd, and they are very far apart on my chest. I really can't stand going out without a bra on because the conical shape of my breasts becomes very apparent - my shirt will fall flat against the middle of my chest, making my breasts look really odd. If I'm going out, I will wear a padded bra with even more padding to lift my breasts and push them more towards the middle so my breasts look rounder than they really are.

**Now to the point**, because of my dislike of my breasts and the lack of development for at least a few months now, I am exhausting the only other option I have before giving up and getting breast augmentation, which is switching to estradiol injections. I plan on documenting my progress on them, with pictures of my breasts every week or so, as well as detailed info on how I'm feeling.

For anyone interested, here is what my regimen was (as far as I can remember):

* 0-1 month: 1mg Estradiol, 25mg Spiro ($8/month)
* 1-2 months: 2mg Estradiol, 50mg Spiro ($12/month)
* 2-6(?) months: 4mg Estradiol, 100mg Spiro ($24/month)
* 6(?)-11(?) months: 6mg Estradiol, 150mg Spiro ($36/month)
* 11(?)-13 months: 6mg Estradiol, 200mg Spiro ($44/month)
* 13-17(?) months: 6mg Estradiol, 300mg Spiro ($60/month)
* 17(?)-24 months: 6mg Estradiol, 50mg Cyproterone Acetate (about $42/month)
* Now: 20mg Estradiol Valerate every 2 weeks, 50mg Cyproterone Acetate daily (about $42/month, would be even cheaper if the vial didn't have such a fast expiration..)

The reason I made the switch from Spiro to CPA is that the Spiro was not properly suppressing my testosterone levels. The last blood test I had while on Spiro showed that they were in the 200 range (I forget what unit was used). The female range was much lower, and just a few weeks after switching to CPA I could FEEL my testosterone levels completely wiped out, and the blood tests I got confirmed it was almost completely gone.

Some info about where I got my meds:

* Estradiol pills: generic, from Wal-Mart. $4 per 30 x 2mg pills. These were oval-shaped, blue, and I think they were micronized beta-17 estradiol, not estradiol valerate
* Spironolactone pills: generic, from Wal-Mart. $4 per 30 x 25mg pills (this made my regimen pretty expensive when I was at 300mg)
* Cyproterone acetate: generic brand Siterone, from In House Pharmacy. $51 per 50 x 50mg pills
* Estradiol valerate: unknown brand, from Strohecker's online pharmacy in Oregon. ~$50 for one 40mg/ml 10ml vial (400mg total), lasts about four months before hitting the expiration date. Comes with the needles and syringes needed
* Prometrium (micronized progesterone): from Wal-Mart. $48 per 30 x 100mg pills - I did not stay on progesterone because it messed with my mood way too much and was far too expensive (almost $50 per month..)

**Yesterday, March 14th, I started my first estradiol injection.** I purchased it from Strohecker's pharmacy, the price was a little over $50 with shipping. Because they don't ship to VA, I had to have my aunt in Indiana ship it to me. (reshipping is technically illegal, but so is ordering from overseas. I don't really worry about the legality of it, especially since I have a prescription for this stuff)

As I said I plan on documenting this as well as I can, with pictures of my breasts every week or so, and in the end my goal is to prove whether or not injections are better than oral estradiol. (at least in my case)

**My goal:** Tanner stage 5 breasts (round shape, nipples no longer puffy), sensitive nipples (for obvious reasons), and an [inframammary fold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inframammary_fold) below the breast. The actual cup size doesn't matter to me, I'd be fine with an A cup as long as they look like they are done growing. I'd say if I were to pick a cup size, anything bigger than a C would probably look too big on me. A C cup would be perfect, a B cup would be awesome, and an A cup would be fine. I am small framed anyway :P

**Questions I'm sure will get asked**:

* Did you try taking progesterone? **Yes, and it was way too expensive and had profoundly negative effects on my mood (mood swings and erratic behavior). I took the bioidentical kind. I might try out medroxyprogesterone acetate soon if I can get my doctor to prescribe it, but I've heard it can cause depression so I'm in no rush**
* Did you ever try taking your E sublingually? **Yes, but it was a huge pain and I noticed no differences**
* Have you thought about using patches or gel instead? **Yes, but patches sound like a huge pain and from others' experiences, injections seem to be the best. I haven't ran into many people who used gel so I have no idea about that**


**Now** to start the documentation :) If you'd like to follow my progress, you can just **save or bookmark the thread**. I might make a new post maybe once a month or so so that people who missed this thread can also see my progress. I will be updating it daily with ramblings about how I feel and whether I've noticed any physical changes.

* Day I started on injections: Thursday, March 14th, 2013.
* Starting dose: 20mg (.5 ml) once every two weeks
* Injection site: outer butt

Due to the high concentration of the solution I'm taking (40mg/ml), I may switch to 10mg/week instead. I have a feeling I am going to feel absolutely dreadful the days right before my next injection, so I'm going to watch my moods closely.

Info about my breasts before starting injections:

* Large gap between them naturally
* Nipple is small but the areola is large and puffy.
* Breasts aren't aching or itchy, and aren't sensitive to my touch (in other words, they aren't an erogenous zone)
* Aching/itchiness hasn't occurred for over a year
* Conical shape, mainly because of the puffy nipples
* Tanner stage seems to be between 3 and 4
* Cup size seems to be about an A cup. I can wear a B cup bra but I can't completely fill the cups of the bra because of my breast shape. The bra I wear is a 36B with lots of padding. If I want to wear a low cut shirt, I will put toilet paper or tissues underneath my breasts to push them towards the middle
* The right breast (your right) is bigger than the left one
* Breast ""width"" is very small
* No growth within the past few months. The last growth spurt I noticed was right after switching to CPA
* Internal mass feels like a large ball of tissue which is smooth
* [Pictures (front and side views)](http://imgur.com/a/LQWbg) - side view really shows how conical they are

**Day 1 (day before making this thread)**: Injection went just fine, I took 20mg (.5 ml) which is supposed to last me two weeks. My mood was absolutely fantastic all day. I don't know if it was the E or just my excitement for (hopefully) new results on the injections. I felt I looked more feminine throughout the day.

**Day 2 (day of making this thread):** Mood went back to normal mostly. The injection site feels a little bruised but isn't very painful. This is a sign that we did the injection correctly. Other than that, nothing notable. edit: I've noticed a few small shooting pains in random areas of my body throughout the day, and some other odd sensations I don't normally feel. Maybe it's starting to make changes already? Also my areolas feel way softer than they normally do and slightly more sensitive but it's probably in my head.

**Day 3:** Morning: Nothing new to report right now.  
-------Evening: Mood is shot, a bit after waking up I started having kidney stone pain which almost made me cry. Then my dad upset me (long story but it involved him using the wrong pronouns), and now I just feel like shit.

**Day 4:** Morning: Nothing new to report other than that my mood is low like it was the night before. I feel miserable right now, I hope it's not the E causing it.  
-------Afternoon: I plucked the hairs on my upper lip, and the root of each hair was blonde. I have no idea if that's related to the E, but I hope this means they're all going to revert back to blonde. Also my mood isn't as awful as it was earlier.  
-------Evening: My nipples (not the areola, just the nipples) are suddenly much more sensitive, they actually hurt a little if I touch them. Also when my breasts aren't conical (temperature changes can cause that), I noticed the upper part of my left (your right) breast now looks bigger!

**Day 5:** Evening: Nipples are still very tender, but that's about the only changes noticed. I had to go to the ER this morning because I was unable to urinate, and this was most likely caused by a kidney stone. I've had kidney stones in the past and the pain felt exactly like the pain I had had felt the Sunday of last week, this Saturday, and today. I ended up puking because I drank so much fluid and my body could no longer process it due to a back up. Urine tests showed nothing, though, which means either something odd is going on, or I had a kidney stone and passed it and I'm simply having post-kidney stone issues with my UT.

**Day 6:** Same as before, but my breasts seem to be rounder more often, which is a good thing. I hope it means they'll eventually permanently settle in that shape. The face on my skin has also dried out a lot, before I was getting a little acne and I'm not sure why, now it's dry to the point of peeling. I think what happened was my skin became drier and the acne stuff I've been using dried it out to the point where it feels like I have a very mild chemical burn :/

**Day 7:** Nothing new going on today, and my nipples seem to be back to normal.

**Day 8:** Nothing new other than my testicles seem smaller, which is definitely a good thing. Die, testicles, die! D:

**Day 9:** Still nothing new to report.

**Day 10:** Nipples aren't aching anymore. My mood seems fine so far, but I feel less emotional.

**Day 11:** I felt like my levels plummeted, so I went ahead and did my next injection. I didn't get the whole 0.5 ml in my first injection because my mom thought there was an air bubble in the syringe (there wasn't) and didn't inject all the fluid. Also, I took 0.25 ml this time (10 mg) and plan on doing weekly injections instead of biweekly because of the concentration of my medication.

**Day 12-17:** Nothing new to report :( On Days 16 and 17 I hit a pretty bad low emotionally, I'm chalking it up to an incorrectly administered injection. The first two injections leaked some of the medication out.

**Day 18:** Happy Easter :) Took injection #3, early again because some leaked out last time and my moods have been absolutely awful. This time we did the Z track method for injecting which made sure none leaked out. Took 20mg this time just because I felt like 10mg was like.. nothing.

**Day 19/20:** Sorry I've been kinda late updating lately. Nothing new other than that my skin seems a little different in my face, but I have no clue if I'm just seeing things.

**Day 21-25:** Sorry again for not updating, not much has happened. The bottom of my right (your left) breast has gotten noticeably bigger/harder but isn't noticeable unless you actually feel around down there.

Murrieta, CA or Boise, ID.",lowluh,38,10,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/18ob9t/really_urgent_just_got_kicked_out_i_have_2_weeks/,"I've posted a couple of times on this subreddit, so I know how kind you all can be. I just came out to my dad, and he is throwing myself and my wife out of the house and cutting us off financially. He is also forcing me to sign over custody of my daughter. I have almost no money, no friends, no family to turn to. My wife's best friend has offered to let us stay with her Orr her parents, but she lives in Boise. My dad is refusing to pay for bus or plane tickets and is taking my car. I would have to spend every penny I have, including credit, to get to Boise.

So I'm here asking for some resources. I am going to need health insurance right away when I get to Boise. Is anyone ffamiliar with government health care/Medicare in Idaho? Myself and my wife both take medication for bipolar disorder and, I'm not sure either of us can hold a job without our meds.

I really hate to ask, but is there any other subreddit I could go for perhaps quick monetary assistance? We need to make it to Boise, get at least a month of meds, pay for food/some form of rent, and perhaps some pillows and blankets. We have clothes to take, and other things.

Is there maybe a foundation that can help someone who badly wants to begin transitioning find a job? I'm currently in school online, but I'm not sure if I can handle staying in school and working full time. Maybe I can ge some financial assistance from school?

Thanks for any help. I'm really scared and so is my wife. We're being forced away from the daughter we've raised and loved for the past two years, and are both very skeptical about even being alive anymore. I really hope we can find some help.

Edit: My dad has offered for me to plead a case to him to not get thrown out.  Essentially, to agree to things he says, promise to work and go to school full time instead of part time, and stuff.  Unfortunately, what is best for my family may to give up freedoms and a bit of dignity so we can all be together and safe.  I have no idea how it will go or if it is even an appeal to stay at home.  I'll keep you all updated and I really appreciate all the support and help.  Fingers crossed.

Edit 2:  So last night I was pretty much told, ""Get a job within a week or get out.""  However, this morning my dad pretty much said, ""We're okay, just work hard and get a job, but no ultimatums, don't worry.""  I'm really not exactly sure why he had such a sudden change in heart (I'm sure it has something to do with my very loving mom), but it looks like I'm pretty safe now.  So all I can say is, thank you all for being so supportive and helpful, and making us realize how important our daughter really is to us.  I'm going to be looking for a p/t or f/t job super hard and maybe we can be out of here in a year or so, and not have to worry at all anymore.

downvotetehtruth, especially, thank you for making us come to the harsh realization that we were actually taking advantage of my parents pretty hardcore.  We needed the wake-up call from someone other than them.  Thank you to everyone who PM'd myself and my wife offering advice and help.

I'm going to leave the post up so people in similar situations can see some of the resources from both of our threads if they need it.  And I'll be abandoning this specific account, so don't think I died or something.  I may come back with an update in a few months if anyone is interested.

I'm selling my old motorcycle, a 1994 Kawasaki Ninja, on Craigslist.

I went through all the long spiel of typing up the repertoire of what kind of bike it is, what kind of maintenance I've done to it (as it has been strictly me that has worked on and repaired every little thing on it), what is good about it, what isn't great about it and so on. Then I got to the bottom of everything and wrapped it up.

After listing my number, I paused as I was about to say ""Ask for Zoey.""

My old name is who the bike is registered to on the title, and because Florida makes you pay $400 to change your name, it's also the same thing that is on my ID card.

I am a very open, transparent individual when it comes to my transition, and I am out to pretty much everyone that is in my life as Zoey, including the people I work with.

But at this point, I stopped, and I thought about the specifics here. The dissonance between my ID and the title, as well as any cues that are still there that I'm male (alas, I don't pass flawlessly) might make things awkward, or even dangerous for me if I'm clocked.

And irritatingly, even if I'm assumed to be a cisgender female, I'm going to be treated like I'm some kind of an idiot because ""girls don't work on motorcycles"", and I'd be taken as a liar by most of the people out there for claiming that I, a girl, did all the work on the bike myself, or assume that the work done on it is shoddy. (I know a lot of sexist motherfuckers in this state.) If I simply explained that I'm transgender to them, that would probably make it even worse, since there are terrible people all over the state that browse Craigslist looking for motorcycles, and many of them don't comprehend the term ""Live and let live.""

Thus, at the end of the post, I simply typed ""Ask for Tom.""

So, in essence, I'm assuming an alter identity for the sake of selling my bike with less hassle. Has anyone else been put into a similar situation, where you had every reason to use your new name and gender, but instead opted to use your old identity for the sake of minimizing potential difficulties?",,False,,t5_2r4b9,False,,smile,True,t3_xjih4,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/xjih4/have_you_ever_been_forced_to_assume_your_former/,

It's SO hard to write that and it's going to be much harder for me to actually do it, but I have to. I've been on HRT for over two years and I truly love what it has done to me. It makes me happy. Really really happy. It's given me the body I always dreamed I should have. It makes me feel alive. I makes me laugh and it makes me cry.


It makes me feel. 


I hate the thought of having a flat chest again. I hate that my skin will revert to male skin. I'm sobbing as I write this and I know the next few weeks, months will be very hard. Life sucks, we go on.

But the thing is I have to face reality and reality is I can't transition to full time. My facial changes have been minimal and I have no chance of ever passing without FFS surgery and I have no way to pay for that now or maybe ever. I've been hiding my boob growth and I hope they are still small enough that I could wear normal shirts again. Reality is I have to live as a man.  God I hate that word... man. I'm not one, I don't want to live as one.

I'm stuck in a hell that I would not wish on anyone, I can't move forward and I hate the thought of living as a man. But really that is the only choice that makes sense. I'm very skinny and my boobs are just under B cup and I have to wear a compression shirt under loose shirts to hide them. And I'm really tired of hiding them. I want all the word to see that I am a woman but with a face like mine it's just impossible. I refuse to be the ""guy in a dress"". I would never do it but I can see why so many transsexuals commit suicide. 

I know stopping is a mistake and I may regret it but I've got to stop and just deal with the consequences. What I am asking for is stories from those of you who quit HRT, or have given up. Did your boobs go away? Has anyone tried raloxifene? It's supposed to reduce gyno in men. So anyway sorry about rambling this is a very emotional decision and I'm really distraught. I hate everything about stopping. But I am.

EDIT: Thanks so very much everyone! I did not intend for this to be a woe is me post BUT I REALLY REALLY appreciate everyone's support and input. I really feel your concerns and everyone is so kind to take the time to try to help. Love you all loads! Some of the posts made me very emotional and I'm going to take some time to think about things before I decide. Hugs to all!

This serves as an effective form of ""small punishment"" in their eyes, even though it hurts much more than grounding or taking money ever could. Not to mention, they will guilt me by reminding me about my expensive binders and therapist, and how I waste all of my energy at an LGBT youth organization instead of doing chores/homework or whatever they choose that day.

We spent a lovely day together yesterday, during which they constantly told me how I look so happy, and how they are so happy my life is going so well.  This afternoon, my girlfriend and I went to lunch with my parents, after which I met with them and gave them a letter I had written.  I poured my heart and soul into that letter, telling them how I feel, and how I always want them to be a part of my life.  Well...everything fell apart.  I doubt they even read beyond the first two paragraphs of the letter.  They were vicious, cruel, and my mother even slapped my arm away as I tried to help her down the stairs.  I told my dad I loved him, and he just glared.

Our niece does not like living with her mom since she has problems related to her unmedicated bi-polar disorder and tends to get violent.

The niece came to visit us recently and came out to us and told us that she wants to be a boy and to change her physical appearance and gender. We're worried about the environment that she's in. Her mother is very religious and coming out to her as being a boy would not go very well. 

Coming to terms with a less-than-common gender and sexuality situation is difficult enough without the family issues she has. We think that we can provide a much better environment for her to discover who she is and who she wants to be, as well as provide the opportunity to live in a city that is a bit more LGBT friendly than most. 

Frankly we would like to offer both parents to take over custody of their daughter but we could use some legal referrals.

Me: ""I don't want to sound rude asking this, just want to clear some things up... Is your support of me as of late, taking into account, well, you know, based on the 'Hate the Sin Not the Sinner' mentality?""

Father:""That's different. That's unnatural and, quite literally, an abomination.""

1356984434.0,29,self.asktransgender,15qlrm,My kids go to school with a transgender child.  Looking for advice.,sacarn,36,7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/15qlrm/my_kids_go_to_school_with_a_transgender_child/,"Please forgive me (and correct me) if my terminology or verbiage is incorrect - I'm not very familiar on the topic, which is why I'm seeking advice.

A little background - 

I have three children, two of them are in school: an eight year old girl, and a nine year old boy.  They are very mature for their age, and we try to be very open and honest with them.  We live in a small town in New Hampshire where everyone is pretty much the same - straight, white, and Christian.  I'm pretty sure we only have one non-white person in town.  My husband and I are very  open minded and loving and accepting of all people, and we are trying to raise our kids that way.

Recently my kids have been coming home talking about Alex.  Alex is in the 4th grade and was born male, but identifies as a female.  Alex dresses like a girl including painted fingernails and makeup, and recently Alex started using the girls restroom.

I'm avoiding the usage of pronouns, because I have no idea which I should use.  Like I said, my husband and I are very loving, accepting people, and the very last thing I would ever want to do is hurt someone by saying the wrong thing.

My kids think Alex is weird.  They haven't used that word, but that's what I gather from the way they talk about everything.  Obviously it's because they don't understand, and heck, I don't even understand.

My husband and I have talked to the kids about Alex on a couple different occasions.  When the kids first stated talking about Alex, they would say stuff like ""Alex is a boy but he dresses like a girl.""  And we would just comment ""That's ok!  Some people like to do that and it's ok.  You shouldn't treat them any differently because of it.""  But when Alex started using the girls restroom, we thought we'd better have a sit-down conversation about it.  

So, we tried to talk to them about being transgender.  We told them that some people are born as a boy, but they feel like they're a girl.  AND THAT'S OK!  They had no clue what we were talking about.  And we didn't know how to explain any further, so we just told them that they need to be accepting of Alex, and that they should never pick on Alex, or treat Alex badly, or differently from any of the other kids at school.  And also that if their friends talk baldy about Alex, or treat Alex differently, they need to tell their friends that that's not ok.  

They're pretty mature for their age, and we are very open with them.  I really would like to talk to them more about it, so if anyone has any advice, I would really appreciate it.

I'm biologically male, age 20, and I've never looked at my penis and thought ""Ew, this is not me"".  I don't spend all day feeling like my body is an entire mismatch, only that something isn't quite right.  My physical body language and mannerisms have always been naturally a bit feminine and I feel emotionally more like a female than a male, and I constantly think of how I would do such a better job as a female, as in I could act more like myself, and people would view me in a way that is more in line with my personality.  Despite being attracted to females (bi) I fantasize about being the woman in a relationship with a man and how much more natural it would feel for me.  The idea of being pretty and getting to wear all those nice clothes is also very endearing to me, but does that really mean that I have a female brain and that I'm trans?  How do I know I'm just tired of trying to be a man because I'm unassertive, chronically depressed and unable to perform the role that society has put out for me?  I feel like I *want* to be trans to the point that there's no confusion over the matter or *not* be trans at all instead of this horrible in between area.  Did anyone else feel this way before?  Did you end up feeling different after you transitioned/saw a gender therapist?  

I entertain the idea that I'm some other form of genderqueer, but I can't help but feel that just because I want to be a girl now means that I'm trans and have a real reason to take action.  Thanks for your time and for reading this jumbled mess.  I'd love to talk about this with someone.

I'm a male, and I identify as straight.  
I've been talking to this girl for a few months online. We met on facebook through mutual friends. We hit it off and had a lot in common, and we eventually started having cyber sex. 

We're really lovey dovey with eachother and we jokingly talk about meeting in person some day (she lives almost across the country, so I don't know if it's realistic). But I started getting suspicious of her from some of her comments and old twitter posts. 

I decided to do some research on google and I found out that she's actually not the girl that she uses pictures of.

She openly admits there, to being a pre-op transgender person, and her local friends and family are aware of it. She says there that the pictures she uses are what she ultimately hopes to look like.

Apparently ""everything's about me"" now.

Before all this, she described me as the kindest soul she knew. Now I'm afraid of even talking to her because I know we're not on speaking terms anymore.

Which got me into this slump; I've always been on bad terms with my parents, but now that I'm basically on my own, they were the only ones I relied on. If I lose my best friends, who right now are the closest thing I have to family, just so I can be comfortable with myself, then I don't know what the point is in transitioning anymore.

I don't know what to do.",throwaway6346,33,2,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/qrjay/please_help_im_hopeless_desperate_and_out_of/,"To start off, I'm a gay 17 year old with gender dysphoria (MtF). I've suffered from it for as long as I can remember but in the past two years, it has gotten increasingly worse, eventually driving me to severe depression. This feeling has constantly been tearing me apart and I knew that I had to make a choice. I could either go on like this and just hope it would get better with time or actually do something about it. I've tried dealing with it, and I've tried to combat it. I've tried fighting it, I've tried being more ""manly"" and going in the exact opposite way, and simply denying my true feeling.

After struggling for so long, I've finally decided to address my true feelings and start dealing with my ""problem"". Having ran out of options, I went to see my GP and told him everything. Fast forward a few visits, and I got a referral to a psychiatrist for an assessment. (just to point out, my GP has been incredibly helpful and sensitive)

At this point, I thought it would be a good idea to tell my parents. After breaking down in front of my mum and dad, I eventually told them that I've always wanted to be a woman and that I was doing something about it. That's where ""shit hit the fan"" and they've flipped out. Three days later, I've decided to talk to them again and here are the main outlines of their thoughts:

* They think that my GP is a pedophile who was ""planting"" these thoughts in my head because he is sexually attracted to me.
* Gender dysphoria doesn't exist. Apparently I'm just confused. According to them, because gender dysphoria doesn't have any physical manifestations (i.e. hormone levels are normal), it is not real. I've tried citing some studies investigating dysphoria but it just bounced off them.
* Also, apparently I'm not homosexual.
* They've also said that ""Even if gender dysphoria is real, there is no way you have it because you're developing as a normal male and males with GID are always dysfunctional, small and weak"".
* I might also have this feeling because I'm ""afraid"" of manhood. (I also have generalised  anxiety disorder and my mum tried to tie it in) I've tried mentioning that the difficulties of manhood are NOTHING compared to the difficulties transgender people face. 
* She also said that because I'm afraid, I don't want to be (either) a man or a woman. She said that I want to be something in between (an ""it"", as she put it) because ""I think that, that will save me from problems of either gender"". 
* I am no longer allowed to take my antidepressant medication because it was prescribed by my GP. 

I cannot break away from my parents for another few years because I'm dependant on them in every possible way. My only option is to (somehow) explain it to them and make them understand.

Right now, I'm very depressed. I don't know what to do. I am out of options and I'm hopeless. **I need some advice.**

I honestly don't know what is going to happen next and I'm scared. 

**Edit:** I don't want to go against them. I still believe that there are ways of reasoning with them. I just need to find the right approach. I won't make it without their support.

**Edit2:** I'm still trying to find a way of getting my parents through their denial. Maybe if accept me for who I really am, they will support me. But right now, I'm in a state of emotional limbo and I honestly don't know what is going to happen. I'm going to see a psychiatrist soon, but for now, I'm in a sort of a ""don't ask, don't tell"" relationship with them.

So far, everyone seemed to be relatively cool about it... except for one person. He has continued to call me by my old name and refer to me as he/him/dude etc.  Everyone else calls me by my chosen name and has made a real effort to change their habits.   Today, after work, I confronted this guy about the issue. I say ""confronted"" but I mean that I politely went to him and reminded him how it has already been two months now and asked if he wouldn't mind calling me by my correct name and pronouns.  He flat out told me ""no"".  I asked him why and he, in turn, asked me what it said on my license.  The gist of the discussion was me saying that by him still referring to me in the manner that he does, I feel he is being disrespectful to me and that I find it a little hurtful.  He told me that he isn't disrespecting me but that I came to work there as a guy and I still am a guy as long as I have a penis and that as long as my name is legally one thing and/or I still got my junk, he will continue to refer to me how he does.  He also told me that if I had already been out and transitioning when I first started, it would be different.  I asked him how so and he told me that that's how he would have met me and that it would be different because of that.  He also made it known to me that he feels that he and my fellow employees are being forced, by management, to comply with my requests.   Now, this was all said in a calm and reasonable, debate-like manner on both our parts. Neither of us got snotty, defensive or aggressive with each other but also, neither of us could see the reasoning with the way the other felt.

Of course, I feel hurt. I wanted to cry the entire ride home. I also feel a little angry because even though he claims to respect me, he clearly does not.  Not as much as anyone else does.

On the other hand, if any of my other coworkers feel the same way he does, that makes me feel just as bad. I want to be respected and not be discriminated against but at the same time, who am I to demand or request that someone cow-tow to me but not respect or allow them there feelings and beliefs, even if they contradict my own.  

Now I don't know how to feel or what to do.  I feel like I don't even want to work there anymore.  I don't want to disrespect anyone or have them feel like I am forcing them to cater to me but I also don't want to be disrespected.

I was wondering if anyone would be interested in having a weekly or bi-weekly voice thread where we share voice recordings with each other, and give each other feedback. I also hope this would inspire others to work on their voices, because I know it's not an easy thing to do, but maybe seeing others improve over time will give people hope.

There are two websites out there that most people seem to be using for audio recordings:

* www.soundcloud.com
* www.vocaroo.com

Personally I prefer soundcloud because, for whatever reason, vocaroo's quality is really poor with my mic, but soundcloud's isn't. Soundcloud also keeps track of all of your recordings, but you have to register to upload anything. If anyone has any other sites to suggest, I'll add them in.

Also, for those of you who haven't started working on your voices, here are some resources you may find useful:

* http://voice.sngjackie.com/1.htm
* http://www.transgendervoice.net/index.html
* [Karmatic's voice tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciWIzpW_X20)
* [The first video in CandiFLA's series of voice tutorials](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbaj4tIX1kw)

If you have something to add to the list, post it and I'll add it in :)

The major one, I feel, is what is between my legs. Not yet having the surgery done, I feel like I can not yet have a very deep sexual or intimate relationship with someone. There is going to be a part of me that will always wonder and question their desire to be with me, or a part that ask “how can they be happy with me?” I am not happy with myself, I find it very hard for other people to be happy with me in that way.

While people have told me it isn't a big deal, to me it is a huge one. I feel like no matter who I am with, man, woman, or possibly another trans person, I feel like I will not be able to fully satisfy their needs. I do not doubt in a short term experience with someone, I can fulfill their needs (and I feel like I have in the past) but a long term relationship, I “know” that they will always wish that I had the correct organs. 

I do feel though, that this mindset is somewhat projecting because I myself really really wish I had the correct organs. Not only do I wish I had them so I could feel comfortable in my own body, but as much as I love anal, it is not something that you can do spontaneously. It also requires a lot of prep work and not everyone wants to go back there (which I haven't met yet, but I'm sure they are out there). Lastly, being “forced” to anal does not make me feel any more of a woman. 

At times, it makes me feel broken or at worst, worthless. Such as some unseen person telling whoever I'm with “we have this one person, you can't fuck them like you would a woman, but you can still fuck their ass, is that ok with you?” and they begrudgingly agree. With such feelings, I feel like sex with me is just the other person taking pity on me, “poor thing, I'll do this just so they feel a bit better” which only makes it worse, though I'm not sure why.

People may tell me I am blowing this out of proportion, or that this isn't the case. I know that for many people, what I am thinking about isn't the case at all. The issue is that is this is how I see it, it's all internal and I have no idea how to stop it. I am really really hoping SRS will make this feeling go away, or greatly diminished it so that it is only a passing thought, but it is so far away. I worry that by the time I undergo the surgery, it will be to late and everything will be to ingrained in my psyche to undo.

I'm so scared that i can't stop puking and crying, but It's the only door left open for me. Four or five months ago I was kicked out of my mothers house for vague reasons, but near as i can tell it was because she thinks i'm a bad person. I've since turned 18 and had to drop out of high-school (i already have my GED), I had found a job but the [silver fire](http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/wildfires/over-80000-acres-burned-in-silver-fire) put me out of work no more than two weeks after i started. I have been staying with my father, an active drug addict, but this living situation is getting out of hand. The apartment is so poorly maintained that i am woken up at intervals through the night by cockroach bites, we run out of food just a week or two into every month, and my father is becoming increasingly volatile. With the threat of violence come morning, staying here is no longer an option. Yesterday I swallowed my pride and went begging to my mother, asking her to take me back and saying that I would find a job ASAP and do all of the house/yard work in return. She just recommended a queer homeless shelter which is already at capacity. My depression has been escalating over the past few months, brought on by my family situation, the environment i'm in, and the trials of early transition. The thought of leaving is helping me to feel happier, but i'm still scared. My greatest fear is running out of my [medication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy_(transgender), without which all of my current struggles would have been for naught. I have been attempting to make an appointment with a therapist to help me sort through this, but i'm at the end of the line. I cant go to a hospital because I am not accessing my medication via prescription and am terrified of having them taken from me. Although i was considered to be popular in high school I was never close to anyone, and as such i find myself with no friends to help me out of this. I have some experience hitchhiking and intend to leave the state, not only because its a concrete goal which I think is important here but because I cant see myself living in town anymore and I think its time for a change of scenery.

I don't know where i'm going to go or how i'm going to get to a safe place.

I know that i'm not likely to pull myself out of this mess without a little help so if someone could point me in the right direction here or just give me good advice it would be much appreciated. Alternatively, if someone is willing to support me for a few weeks while I get on my feet that would be great too, I understand the gravity and risks of what i'm asking but I have every intention of repaying anyone who helps me in full and making it worth their while (sugardaddies need not apply).

I'm struggling with a lot of shame these days. My reactions to my changing body, presentation, and social interactions oscillate from joy to embarrassment. (I don't present female publicly). Simultaneously I want to hide and be out in the open. 

I'm happy and embarrassed my breasts are developing. I want them to develop faster...and then hide them under a baggy hoodie. I'm encouraged when others notice changes in my appearance, but then I feel exposed. I have a similar deal with clothes: initially happy and comfortable, then anxious. I felt naked when I wore a top ""publicly"" for the first time, to a recent my support group meeting. I don't want anyone to know, then I want everyone to know. 

Thinking back, I've had experiences of shame tracing back to my childhood. I was teased a lot in middle school for being perceived to be gay. As a pre-teen, I liked Little Mermaid and then later feeling shameful about it. Same with experimenting with makeup; I carry that shame to this day, feeling too anxious to put it on. I want to go back and reassure the little girl I was; that it's okay, there's nothing wrong with who I am.

 My shameful feelings seem so deeply ingrained. What are your experiences with this sort of thing? How did you cope and address them?

I don't feel comfortable in my own skin. The simplest way to explain it would be that I don't want to be a female. I've been trying to ignore that fact, but there's this constant ache within me. I write fiction stories with the main character as a male. They never are me in a literal sense, but acting through them seems to ease the ache a bit, but it makes the longing worse.  

I didn't know what to do, so I thought I'd come to some place anonymous. I just want this ache to go away. It's disrupting my schooling, my relationships with my family and friends, and now my health. I can't admit what I really want or am feeling to anyone because I'm scared of their reactions, but I can't take being so stressed any longer. I'm scared and so damn lonely, yet I don't want to date the guys who are interested in me because I feel like I'm not being fair to them. One of my friends recently called me a ""homosexual male within a female's body"". It really seems like that's exactly what I am. I don't fit in with any of the girls. I get along with the guys as if I'm one of them, plus I seem attracted to more submissive and often gay guys.  

I don't know what I'm looking for here, but I had to say all this. I just can't hold it in any longer and I just don't know what else to do. Admitting this to someone isn't something that can easily be taken back or forgotten... so I'm not sure I'd ever be able to.      

Edit: I just wanted to take a minute to thank everyone for their kindness. It's comforting to know that there are others like me. Thank you, all of you.

You may be familiar with Tiff and Dade ([ElectricDade](http://www.youtube.com/user/ElectricDade)), a couple who found eachother before Dade identified as a man, married as a same-sex-couple, and then went through the transition process when Dade made the decision to become a truer version of himself. As you watch their videos you are given an intimate look into how their relationship dynamic has evolved and adjusted to their new normal, including the start of a beautiful family. 

My girlfriend and I have both found these videos to be an amazing resource but they never really captured our situation or experiences, and while there are other coupled YouTube voices in the trans community, we’ve felt that they haven’t articulation the kind of information that we would have liked to hear.

I’m a problem solver. If I can’t find a solution, I make one. We want to expand the resources and discourse for trans folk and their partners. We want to make it easier for people to get information about what it’s like to be in a relationship with a trans person and what it’s like as a trans person in a relationship.

We want to cover everything from sex to communication, meeting the parents to style advice, advice for people new to the game to advice for people years and decades into their transition.

**We know what we want to talk about, but this isn’t just about us. We want to provide content that people want to hear about. So, that’s where you come in. We need topics! Help us help you!**

  I thought I would just put up a little bit of my story, in the hopes that those in need of a little shiny in their day will find it. I have listened to and read so many stories, I can not say mine was bad at all!

  I came out to everyone August of last year. My wife did flip out a bit, but we had lots of other issues already and were heading towards divorce. I have never heard of a divorce that was not classified as ""Nasty"", so we will chock that under the ""it happens"" label. I had to live out of my suburban for a bit, during that winter hurricane during last October. It sucked, but it was safe and non-judgmental. 

  I had some friends take their time, some did drop off the map a bit. But all of the important ones stuck around, and even have made a few more absolutely amazing friends! I am even dating a trans furry I met, and am enjoying the heck out of it. 

  I work as a welder and fabricator, very blue collar. Not a single person has given me strife. I don't come in with earrings and makeup on, but HRT has given me obvious attributes. Most have switched pronouns on their own, and are very kind. I have found in the blue collar world that if you let someone do their own thing, they will let you do your own. 

  Family didn't give me any strife at all! everyone came around right quick, and even has written me letters of encouragement. My dog loves me more too.

  I came up with a strategy early on that paid off big time, and I hope helps others. I figured out that the choice was entirely my own, and that if I didn't let anyone else influence it I would be happier. That also led into a strategy with dealing with others. I introduced myself as Maddie, that I was a girl. Even to friend that I have had for over a decade. And after that I did not correct a single person. They used the wrong name, or pronoun, I let it slide. But more and more people just started doing what I desired, and the mass has influenced the stubborn. I highly recommend this as patience is the hardest aspect of transitioning, and the more you can find the easier it gets. 

  Good luck girls and boys, and know that the story is a roll of the dice. Some are good, some are bad, but we are all here for each other. ",,False,,t5_2r4b9,False,,,True,t3_1d5ojh,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1d5ojh/not_all_stories_go_badly/,

""You were raised as a male, so you can't understand""
""You're more assertive than the average female""
""Girls wouldn't act the way you do""
""I wasn't trying to offend you. I will just talk to you different""

This is all coming from a really close friend who I came out to and for the most part has been really supportive... He asked my opinion on whether or not a girl liked him, I told him the way she acted looked like a no. 

All of that came after. 

I just started crying and to him this meant that I ""can't control my emotions"" and that lead to the ""you cry too much"". 

How would you react in this situation? 

I don't even know what to say and I don't know how I should feel. I took a nap after it happened and now that I'm up I just feel so upset.

The reassurance that I wasn't broken, the kind words and commiseration and the resources people linked for me really helped. Enormously. I was at a suicidal tipping point and this sub is a large part of why I'm still alive today and able to post this. So THANK YOU to everyone who helps people here!

In the 18 months since then I have learned a hell of a lot about embryonic/fetal development, the effects of the hormone environment on pre-natal sex-differentiation and that sometimes the different stages of sex-differentiation don't all go in the same direction.

I think back to how I acted and things I did and how terrible I was sometimes.  Like the way I dealt with being trans was to disassociate myself from all emotions and connections.  Until I came out to myself as a trans woman, I can say I had no idea what it meant to have genuine passion for someone or the value people place on each other and their connections to one another.  I could never get there.  

So I was basically the classic ""nice guy"" that turned women off and was sometimes very rude or mean to them for no reason.  I just didn't understand what it meant to be a person that wasn't disassociated from their life and I was just sort of mystified by or idolized their femininity.  One thing I would do all the time is ask out women I was enamoured by in really awkward forced ways and then get really mad at being ""friendzoned"".  Or I would try to get really close to women without actually building a close relationship and just weird them out. Each of these sort of friendships would end with some awkward blow up where they'd realize I was a jerk. (As an aside: this was all like pure female idolization because I'm also straight, so deep down I wasn't even sexually attracted to this women.)

Now, I'm a totally different person that's nice to everyone and respects boundaries and it's really easy for me to be that way.   I still feel incredibly shameful about my past actions, especially when I'm talking to a group of women and they bring up ""nice guys"" or whatever.  I just like think about how I used to be a ""nice guy"" and I'm therefore unworthy of their presence or being ""one of the girls"".

I feel like sending out ""sorry I was an asshole"" cards to everyone in my life or something.  I wish I could erase the old me from my memory because I kind of hate the person I was.

My brother just came out as genderqueer/transgender/trying-to-figure-out-why-he-feels-dysmorphic. He is making a lot of good choices, he found friends on campus who are supportive and/or trans, his boss (who is active in LGBTQ education and awareness) helped him find a counselor who specializes in this on campus, and he's trying to move forward and figure out who he is and everything that comes along with that. He hasn't asked anyone to change how they refer to him or any such thing yet, as he's still early days in self-discovery. He calls me when he needs family to talk to, and that's great! 


But so does the rest of my family. Because I stayed, and because I'm the resident feminist (and apparently gender authoritative) of the family, and because my brother has (rightfully) asked for space while he figures this out, my parents are leaning quite heavily on me for answers and clarification of what he's going through, and I don't know how to support them. They don't understand and it seems out of the blue to them. Is there any good literature out there I can suggest, or groups, to help them work through this?

**Edit/Update:** I've compiled everything suggested thus far into a list, and sent it to a couple close family members.  Thank you so much everyone for being so helpful!

I've never liked being a boy and always associated more with women. For most of my life I've wanted to be a woman but always pushed the thoughts down deep. It took me till my mid 30's to finally accept this about myself. After anguishing for a few days I finally told my wife last night. I decided I had to, and that I could, after reading posts and comments here. She was stunned, but amazingly accepted it and is supportive. One of the first things she said was to offer to get me a wig and some clothes so we could go out dressed on the weekends. Even if I wanted to go as far as SRS she said she would be OK with it. This is much more than I expected.

I'm scared and not sure where I am going from here. It feels wonderful to finally accept this and let it out. I want to transition and go on hormones, but I'm worried about my job, or any job. Being the sole breadwinner and working in corporate IT I have to be very careful. We will also have to figure out what to do about her family. They would not accept me as a woman. I would have to hide all of my feminine traits. My mother is supportive and was not a bit surprised. My father, he can just F*#@ off for all I care, have not talked to him in years.

Alas, all was not well on the home front, for the reach of the evil powers Conservatism and Religion had touched her parents. and she was met with much Despair and Disappointment and Bible Quotes flung in her face like the death knights of the crusades had wielded their deadly morningstars o'er their heads.

Mortally wounded, for she had not expected such an attack from those she loved and trusted so much, she crawled back to her Fortress of Fabulousness to recover, regroup and rethink.

Gathering her strength to once more face the perils of the evil forces arrayed against her, she sought wisdom and advice from the oracle of the hivemind to steel herself for the coming battle that would see either the banishing of the evil powers, or the sad goodbyes that must be said to her parents.

Today, I've been having a discussion with some fellow Wikipedians about whether Wikipedia handles gender ascription for trans people well, following the news that the punk musician [Tom Gabel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Gabel) has come out as a transgender woman and intends to transition to become Laura Jane Grace.

Our [manual of style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS:IDENTITY#Identity) on identity says this:

&gt; Any person whose gender might be questioned should be referred to by the gendered nouns, pronouns, and possessive adjectives that reflect that person's latest expressed gender self-identification. This applies in references to any phase of that person's life. Nevertheless, avoid confusing or seemingly logically impossible text that could result from pronoun usage (for example: instead of 'He gave birth to his first child', write 'He became a parent for the first time').

I'm not sure why we use the term ""questioned"", or exactly how we've reached this policy ('tis lost in a mist of discussions past). We've had various discussions - [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Archive_92#Transgender_pronoun_issue), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Archive_74#Transgender_pronoun_.2F_identity).

I guess what I'd like to know is: is our policy problematic? If you look at [Category:Transgender and transsexual people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Transgender_and_transsexual_people) (or just look up particular trans people), can you find any particularly problematic examples of Wikipedia's coverage of trans identity and issues (or LGBT issues more generally)?

It seemed like she took it very well and was 100% behind me and understood. Made me happier than I can ever remember being. I had worried about her accepting me and abandoning me over this forever, and this had finally put all of that to rest.

But last weekend she tried to kill herself. Because of me.

She had been lying to me. Just pretending to be okay with it to keep me happy and not to hurt me. We talked and she completely tore into me. Attacking me and trying to invalidate nearly everything about my existence.

She kept telling me that she can't get over it because she's losing her son. That I'm killing ""him"" and that I'll be another person. And that this is all her fault, as if me being me is a problem that can be blamed on someone.

She told me that there was no way I was trans since I had told her that I had felt this way from my earliest memories. Which had to be a lie because if I had really felt this way she would've picked up on it for sure.

And then the biggest load of BS - That I would've gone about this way earlier and way different if I was really trans. Which really hit me as ironic since avoiding this kind of situation was exactly why I was so scared to come out earlier in the first place.

I just don't know what to do. Or what to say. This hit me out of nowhere and I'm still pretty stunned and scared...

Lots of the media covers it more positively than before.   Even conservative places like Bill O'Reilly and Maury are much more positive in nature towards transpeople.  

Idea:  I'm always the glass half full type.  So I bet we can create change.  I'm not sure quite how gay marriage has become so accepted.  I think a lot of it has to do around positive media coverage and inclusion in tv shows where it is not sensationalized. I say we lobby a show like glee to put in a trans character.

Were it up to me, I'd let him wear whatever it may be and be the girl he is certain should exist.

I'm not the problem. It's the father. We're not together, and for good reason. Sadly, when he moved, he took my son and his sister across the US from me. Any mention of homosexuality, alternative lifestyle or gender issues turns him into a raging fool. He's bigoted, cruel, and says that he'd disown our kid. He bullies him into saying he's a boy, and has broken his spirit. I'm not able to be there for him and help, and my ex won't give the kids up, either. What the hell can I do to save my son this torment? What can I say? It breaks my heart that my poor child is being destroyed by the person he should look up to and trust. I try to console him, but it's to the point that he refuses to say anything about it. Ever. I'm scared for him, really, but I know telling a judge ""hey, I need to take my kid away from dad because he's actually a girl, not a little boy."" When I spoke to my kid about gender issues and sexual differences (we went to the park when there was a pride fest... kids asked questions, I answered truthfully and positively) and he jumped up and yelled ""THAT'S JUST LIKE ME!"" I think it's clear this isn't a ""phase"" as my ex seems to assume.

This is where I'm at as it stands:,JesusLizardLizard,31,3,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/ogvwh/confused_this_is_where_im_at_as_it_stands/,"I've been obsessed with transgender topics ever since I learned about them not to long ago. I am still confused and doubting, which is to be expected. This seems to have just come out of nowhere though and hit me like a ton of bricks. Is that even possible? Is this a phase?

Here is what I know:

* I would rather be a girl. If i could wake up as a girl tomorrow I would do it. There is very little doubt here. Thinking about being a girl makes me really happy. What I lack here is experience. I've never dressed up, or even allowed myself to *think* these thoughts until recently. Those thoughts have always been too scary for me to go near.

* I am and have for as long as I can remember been generally unhappy with my life. I've felt like the biggest faker without knowing why. I've felt ashamed without knowing why. I've never fit it but I pretended to. I've always been searching for what's wrong with me, because I never felt right.

Here is what I don't know:

* I don't know how related those two things are. It's easy assign all my problems to my gender, but that seems like a leap in logic to me. This isn't the first time I've tried to assign my problems to something. I once thought I was bipolar, which seems silly now. This feels different though. This feels good. This feels a bit like when I discovered (yes, discovered) I was an atheist.

I suppose my doubt comes from these feelings appearing so late. I'm almost 18, and if you had told me I was trans a month ago I would have denied it. I admit I was a bit transphobic. I was raised around lots of boys and almost no girls and I was always teased, so I've always been very careful not to seem like a sissy. I've never felt close to my friends. I was raised being told gays, and presumably trans people, were *wrong*. Other people were those things, but not *me*. The other day I asked my mom, ""what if I was gay, would you still feel that way?"" She shut me down. ""Stop saying that! You're not gay. Don't think it's ok for you to be gay. It's wrong!"" Or something like that.

So, is it even possible that I'm trans? Or is it just a phase? I kind of don't want it to be just a phase, for some reason. I am definitely deluding myself, I just can't tell which way.

I know the standard response: see a therapist. I want to and I plan to, it just seems so far off. If anyone has an therapist recommendations for the Burbank area that would be appreciated. I plan on exploring, and dressing up when I get the chance (I think I'd feel weird borrowing other peoples clothes, so I think I'll buy some). I guess I'm looking to be validated, or accepted, or just talked to. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for with this post.

Also, I just want to thank all of you for existing and being so helpful :) I love you (which is something I never would have said before because it's ""girly"", even though that's how I feel).",,False,,t5_2r4b9,False,,pinko,True,t3_ogvwh,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/ogvwh/confused_this_is_where_im_at_as_it_stands/,

Pretty confused. ,,30,2,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/ns3if/recently_found_out_my_boyfriend_would_rather_be_a/,"Maybe I shouldn't be posting anything like this, considering it's hush-hush, but that's why this is a throwaway and I seriously want to get some advice on this... 

So I met my friend online about three years ago. To sum it up, we're best friends, we know everything about each other, we're in love for the foreseeable future, and we're completely comfortable with talking about anything. Our relationship is a very positive thing in my life. I'm a female, by the way. Not sure what my sexual preference is, I think I'm leaning towards bisexual or pansexual, but primarily straight... I don't know. I'm still internally debating this because I'm young, but anyway.

About two weeks ago he asked me if I had ever wondered if I was meant to be another gender. I said not really. He then confessed that all his life, he's been having gender identification issues. When he was younger, he wanted to be a female so badly, he'd wish it would happen every day. He's been depressed about it before, but he's told me he's been emotionally fine recently. He feels like his male genitalia don't belong on him. He's sort of overweight, so he's unhappy with his body on multiple levels. He feels like he should've been born a girl. He made it clear to me that he's not interested in men. Of course I love him very much, and this news didn't change how I felt about him... I honestly should've been able to tell sooner. He's pretty sensitive, he relates to me very well, and he hasn't shown much stereotypically ""male"" behavior. I feel like him questioning his gender explains a lot of that. 

But I've also been very anxious about this whole thing. Mainly because this, and the weight, are causing him to not be comfortable with his body. I'm attracted to him, but no compliments or nice things I say about him could ever make him love himself. He's got low self-esteem, and he *sees no problem with it at all.* I told him that I'd like to be with someone who has confidence. Someone I can have a family with (he's told me he hates the idea of having kids. Now I understand why). He told me that sometimes he wishes he could have surgery to become a woman, but he knows it's ""not a possibility,"" so he's just going to live with not being entirely happy with himself. That just... seems wrong to me.

It seems to me that his situation (and I've talked with him about this theory, and he didn't seem to think it's insensitive) is parallel to how I feel about my nose. It's ugly, and I've never liked it, but I've settled with just living with it. Sometimes I want plastic surgery, but I know that it could easily go wrong and cause me to hate my nose even more, and on top of that it's very costly. So I'll continue to live with the face I have. 

I've been worried sick about him since he's ""come out"" and he's basically been telling me ""chill out, it's really not that big a deal. I'm not  happy with myself. So what? I'm alive, anyway, and that's good enough."" I just want him to live a happy and confident life. I'd suggest therapy, counseling, something, but he'll just tell me he doesn't need it. I feel like he always has these unhealthy mindsets, but he rationalizes them to the point that I doubt if it's right to tell him to correct them, hah...

 wanted to speak to you both of this, most notably in the car during our most recent trip, but I could not bring
 myself to do it in person. Finally, I beg of you to read this whole letter before anything (and please don’t call 
right away, I am not sure how I would handle my emotional reaction). 

	So, down to the bare bones: The point of me writing this letter is (well, because I’m not sure I could 
handle a face to face confrontation, first off) because I want to tell you that I, your son, am trangendered. What 
does this mean? Basically that I am a girl in a boy’s body. This is not some perversion, it is a condition that has 
affected my life in many ways. I had presumed that everyone felt as I did when I was younger, but quickly 
realized that that wasn’t the case. As I grew older, I sought acceptance through manipulating my image to make 
me who I am today (e.g. The hyper masculine “[Me]” who existed @ [high school]). This persona had worked so 
well, and could surely continue on to do great things, but this has been eating away at me for a long time, and 
no longer can I live like this. To be honest (not like anything in this letter has been a lie in the first place), it is 
surprising to me that I hadn’t tried something terrible earlier on, and, for that, I thank you both for being the 
most amazing parents that you are. The reason I say this is because, as far as trans individuals go, ~50% 
attempt suicide before the age of 20. I never want to put you through that. It would destroy me were I to ever 
hurt you like that, but that being said, the topic is almost always on my mind. I fact, I cannot remember a 
single day when I haven’t had thoughts of it. So, with that being said, I choose life. Granted, to make such a life 
bearable, I can only imagine living it as the opposite sex to which I was born. Sadly, though, the world is not as 
open and loving as I could wish, which is one of the reasons I find academia so appealing (not that it’s the 
epitome (misspelled.... le sigh) of tolerance, though)

	This shall definitely cause a lot of heart-ache in the coming years, which is why I would truly love your 
support, but I can also understand how disappointing this may be (to have a son such as I to pull the rug from 
under your feet would surely be quite the blow). If you do not accept me as I am, then I can go elsewhere. I 
have many friends in many places, so don’t worry about that (I could be ready to move out at a moments 
notice, if need be [I’m living with them while applying to graduate programs]). Not that I think you would do 
any such things, but I figured I would state them just in case. I do not intend on telling anyone else in the family 
any time soon. To be honest, I don’t care what they think, and I cam imagine their bigoted (misspelled.... efff) 
responses and jeering behind my back ten fold worse than that which they say about Patrick’s Kristie (my 
cousin’s girlfriend isn’t the same religion as is my extended family, and good god do they let him know of their 
spiteful disapproval). I would love to keep from grandma, though. I am not sure how she would deal with it, and 
I don’t want to cause her any undue stress in her twilight years (to note: my grandma is incredibly loving and 
kind - and is not the one saying such spiteful things. She has never had anything bad to say about anyone, 
ever.). 

	I plan on making an appointment with a gender therapist in the coming weeks to speak with about the 
issue at hand, to make absolutely sure that this is what I want. I believe it is, but I would like to do things by 
the book, as opposed to going and essentially getting drugs on my own. Finally, I want to apologize for my 
recent attitude, This (telling you) has been adding so much stress to that which is already on my plate and I 
have had such a short temper and have been curt far too often. For that, I am sorry. Actually, for everything, 
too, I am sorry. This, I doubt, Is something that parents ever expect to hear/read from their children. Sorry. 
	
	I love you both so dearly,

There were two 'Trans 101' workshops and a movie night as part of a gender neutral restroom campaign and a second movie night about the Two-Spirit identity and a fashion show and a roundtable discussion about the possibility of raising children in a gender neutral way.

So, anyways, I went to just about all of them, and by Thursday, I was feeling pretty confident and I was on omegle, and the person I was talking with inspired me to tell someone. So I told my only friend that I have at my school (and fellow redditor) that I was trans and unsurprisingly, she was totally cool with it. In fact, after I told her, she was still waiting for the thing I wanted to tell her, it was that much not a big deal.

Then, on Saturday, I had a delicious breakfast of donuts while I helped a fellow student with her math homework. In the evening I went to my local trans group (Tranz Central Coast) for the first time for a TDoR ceremony, which was alternately depressing and inspiring, and met a bunch of other trans people, but since I'm terribly awkward and asocial in ""mingling"" situations, I left shortly after the ceremony concluded. To reward myself for that, I went and bought some shoes and the cashier called me ma'am, which was pretty great.

tl;dr This week, I came out to a friend for the first time, went to my first meeting with other trans people in real life, got somewhat involved with my school's queer community, and had donuts with mathematics.

He has a supportive girlfriend, who's gung-ho to help him. He's going to be starting horomone treatments soon. What can I do to support him? Because this is a lot for someone to be going through, on top of being depressed.

My parents are still at the stage of hoping he won't transition and will ""Find God"" and stay as a male and be all religious and stuff. I know he won't do that, he feels imprisoned.

It's obvious, through what she told me, that she didn't like the fact that I came out... but I don't understand why she thought I got this from my classmates, when in fact it was a completely different experience.

It took 15 minutes for her to talk, and another 15 minutes talking (and crying) to my boyfriend (who she doesn't know about) on the phone, and another 80 minutes for me to finally get to sleep. Which is why I feel like absolute **** on the first day back from March Break...

Cross-post from LGBT",bunny_squisher,32,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/103o0u/my_brother_wants_to_become_my_sister_but_she/,"My mum told me two days ago that my brother (who i will refer to as he because its easier) came out to her as female inside and he wants to do something about it. Obviously I am completely fine with this and accept him for whoever he is and will support him whole heartedly. My problem is whether to tell him I know or not.

My mum told me because she is worried about him and as she's 58 doesn't really know how to handle this kind of thing, in the brief conversation we had she mentioned she didn't understand and was even a little angry at this decision. Saying it was a stupid thing to do before she was interrupted.

I think I should try and explain everything to my mum about how this works and how as a Cis-gendered individual her saying its a stupid idea is very ignorant and pretty offensive. I'm going to come out in full support of him and try to convince her to do the same. I'm basically thinking that she just doesn't know much about it and is trying not to take it too seriously. She likes to try and bury her head in the sand over family issues.

Back to my point, He doesn't know my mum told me. She hasn't told anyone else, my dad wouldn't be impressed, he's a bit of a dick, and my sister isn't very close with our brother.

My options are to either text him (he's pretty socially awkward and I don't want to make him uncomfortable by the end of the week we will both be back at uni) and tell him I know, and fully support him and I'm there if he needs to talk and that I think he should reach out to his uni or the doctors and get some regular counselling (he saw someone a few times but hasn't been back since and I think it might help)

OR I wait and see, keep quiet and just wait for him to tell me and respect his wishes of secrecy.

A complex dilemma and I could really use the advice of people who have been in the same situation. Thanks for reading.

I would, first off, like to apologize in advance if I offend anyone. It's not my intention. I was encouraged to post here by a MtF friend.

I've found that, as my life has gone on, I'm actually more attracted to trans girls than cis ones. Why? I don't know. I just don't. I've tried and tried to figure it out, and I just can't. It's just there.

The thing is, I'm not like the chasers I've seen people rant about, who just want a quick hookup. I want a *relationship*. I want to be there for support, to make her feel like the girl she is. The way I see it, I'm wired this way. I can't do anything about it and it's not going to change. But maybe I can make someone really happy.

What's the general consensus here? Is it wrong for me to feel like this? Should I just forget it and push it aside? Should I pursue a relationship with a trans girl, and if so, where do I look? 

I'll edit this post if anything else relevant comes to mind. Again, if I've offended anyone, I'm really, really sorry.

Most forms (including forms I've built in the past) have a simple binary choice that doesn't differentiate between sex and gender. That got me thinking - what do you want to see on webforms?

* What to ask for? Gender or sex?
* If gender, what about intersex people?
* If sex, what about transgender people?
* Based on the previous questions, what options should there be other than male/female? (if any)
* Should it be an optional field?
* What mistakes have I already made in this post?
* Anything else?

Gender: Does it really need to be asked? If not then don't. Client might override this though.

Is it just for display purposes? If so a single optional text field.

Otherwise:

* Male
* Female
* Other (textfield)
* I'd rather not say (to make it optional)

* Drop the text field for other? 
* Autocomplete, with an initial list, that grows with each new answer.
* Sliders (Awesome idea but I don't know how viable it will be).

Next question, If I have to, which set of options is most appropriate:

So, when someone learns that you are trans, have you ever had that person tell you that you are 'brave"" for what you are doing, and if so, how did that make you feel? I think it's one of the reasons that I like the meme/circle jerk ""so brave"" as much as I do, because while it's well intentioned, I think it comes out different than the speaker expects it to. 

I've had this happen a couple of times with different feeling on it. Most of the time it's silent amusement, like ""you don't even know buddy"". With these people, they usually have a very surface level idea of what I am going through (have watched a talk show or two) and have basically no context where I struggle and where I don't (ex: Identity. Yes I don't like my body, but I know exactly who I am). With these people, I am silently tempted to inform them about employment discrimination/limited medical access/constant I.D. problems/ the whole shebang so I can part ways sipping my beer and having them stand there shell-shocked from the mind fuck.

Sometimes it's like ""wow, I'm glad you didn't see me squealing in horror at that bug I just squashed just now"". The phrase ""so brave"" for some reason seems so vague to me that somehow it implies that because I struggled with one thing, I am somehow brave and level headed in everything else in my life. Now I gotta make sure no one know my dirty secrets (I have never saved a baby from a burning building . . . don't tell anyone) so they don't think I'm not as brave :P

More often than not though, admittedly, I feel insulted/angry. I try not to, because I realize the statement is supposed to be well intentioned and I try to keep a positive, level head about things, but i can't help but feel that I wouldn't need to be so ""brave"" if other people didn't make me have to be. I realize what they WANT to say is ""you seem like a very strong person to know yourself so well and to say fuck it to social norms if favor of your own independence"" but what is ACTUALLY implied is ""Good luck to you buddy, you're going to need it"".

So how about it folks, how does it feel to be ""so brave"".

* I'm 100% comfortable speaking with them; they've been very supportive so far. (Particularly on the bathroom issue, but also with preferred name as well)

* I have not been with the company long, and I was living full time when I started. They knew I was trans when they hired me.

* It is a large company with a third party insurance provider. The policy contains an ironclad exclusion of any surgery, therapy, pharmaceuticals, or anything that can be classified as ""leading to"" surgery.

So, let's be real here: this will come down to money. I plan to approach it from a standpoint of the value the company places on diversity, and point out how trans exclusions fail to uphold that. It also further jeopardizes trans people when reimbursement is denied because of gender marker mismatch (women getting prostate exams, for example). What I don't have is information on the cost to a company to get that restriction removed, or what the rationale is for the exclusion being there in the first place.

I want to put out the idea of getting ranked in the HRC's corporate index (save the HRC hate for elsewhere; that list *is* a valuable resource) because they'll be one of the only companies ranked by the HRC that has a trans inclusive policy in this state. That ranking is also one of those tangible things that can be obtained rather than just a fuzzy feeling of doing the right thing.

I just can't fathom something that is going on with my mom.  I came out two years ago at christmas.  It was predictably bad, almost nuclear, the entire family went ape shit on me because i made mom cry.  I ended up leaving the house and staying in a hotel for my christmas.  After a few days i got the phone call that started the eventual reconciliation.  I think she realized that I wasn't going to concede and that she wasn't going to ever see me again if she didn't learn to come to terms with it.

It was a long tough row to hoe, because she's old and set in her ways.  She had me really late and I'm not exactly a spring chicken.  But eventually she seemed to come to terms with it and become a supporter.  In fact she's taken my side when other family members have rejected me.  I'm several years into HRT, and have gone through comprehensive FFS and am done with hair abatement, and have had other procedures as well.  As much as I hate to admit it, I look pretty good.  I'm not willing to believe that I pass 100% but I look good, and no one, but no one gives me a hard time or a second glance when I'm out alone.

But she keeps misgendering me, and I mean chronically.  She'll do it 50 times in the course of dinner.  She uses ""boy name"" also, but when I say, ""excuse me, are you talking to me"" she'll correct it.  But the pronouns are out of fucking control, it's like a constant stream of male pronouns.  She just doesn't stop.  The excuse is too predictable ""I'm too old to change.  I've knew you forever as male"", but even during the process of me correcting her, she is still continuing to refer to me as male.  It's truly like some kind of habitual mental blockage.  Yesterday she did it in discussions with a waiter and a hostess, as well as my friends over the course of a dinner out.  It just never ends.  I finally blew up at her, and then her tear fountain started up, and I had to listen again to how hard it was for her, and how hard she's trying and how impatient I am and how I expect perfection that no one can live up to.

After that was over i felt that old familiar desire to eat an entire bottle of pills, not to punish her or anyone else, but just so that the struggle will be done.  I'm really worried because I haven't felt that way for ages.  I really don't know what to do.  The argument continued today and after pressing her on the subject she finally said to me, ready for this...""I'm afraid to refer to you as female in the presence of other people because I'm worried that people will ridicule you and I'd hate to see that happen"".    WHAT?????  I'm dressed as a woman, look like a women, act like a woman, walk like a woman, talk like a women, and she thinks that referring to me as male is LESS embarrassing.  And they tell me I'm crazy!! 

I really don't know what to do.  My relationship with my mother means everything to me.  But I'm really scared that it's reaching a point where i can never be around her again.  She has so little time left, and i can't believe I'm thinking such a thing.  But i just don't know what to do.  I'm really scared that I'm going to act on my suicidal ideations.  I've done it before, although it's been a long time.  But how can I just leave and never talk to her again?  She's already depressed after the loss of my father, and has told me many times that I'm her best friend. 

Are there people who simply can't, won't, or refuse to ""get it"" no matter how many times and ways it's explained to them?   Meanwhile, I'm losing the alies I have because they think I'm being impatient and disruptive, and think I should just get over it.  After all, I'm on hormones, and living my life as a woman, so why should I let a little thing like this drive me to anxiety since she's just doing it because she's old.  People act like I'm picking on her.

tldr: what the fuck do you when someone who means everything to won't stop misgendering you?

I had an appointment at my local Planned Parenthood today, hoping to get a referral to a trans\*-friendly doctor who could prescribe me hormones (I couldn't wait the 6-7 months to see an endocrinologist). As it turns out, my branch just started prescribing hormones for their trans* patients. Fuck yeah! My doctor didn't even ask for a therapist's letter, though she did seem relieved when I said I had been seeing one and that he OK'd me for hormones. YMMV.

Anyways, my point is that if you are looking for a doctor to prescribe hormones but don't want to wait the ridiculous amount of time for an endo, check out Planned Parenthood. If they don't do it there, they may be able to refer you to someone.

Today my fiance, who has seemingly 'forgot' or pushed my transgender issues out of her head, went to shave her legs. She has a rather intense OCD over some things and shaving her legs is one of them, she'll take over 2 hours meticulously doing her legs. 

I've joked before, though I was serious beneath, that I could shave mine faster and do just as good of a job as her. I'm amazed she accepted this challenge because of her freaking out about discovering that I am a woman, but as I said, she attacked me emotional and threatened to put me out on the street, so perhaps she's repressing all that.. anyway.

She accepted my shaving challenge and today the real 'me', got to shave her legs for the first time ever. There were nicks to be had, a world of discovery on the easiest and worst parts to shave, but it was such an amazing emotional experience.

With each stroke of my razor, the ugly hair that has plagued me since I was a early teenager fell away, showing the bare skin that I always desired. Each stroke went a step further to reveal ****her**** legs for the first time in my life, it was like she was getting to peek out of the prison she's always been trapped in.

As I finished I stretched my legs, washing them off.. I could look at them and imagine doing my toenails the way I've always wanted, even having them painted. My legs looked so much more feminine then I had ever thought possible and I only shaved them. Yes, I beat my fiance at shaving her legs, but at that point I didn't care of course and she could care less, but what really mattered was I got to see the legs I'm supposed to have, for just a little bit.

I was quiet the rest of the day, my fiance thought I was acting 'stupid'. But I was just emotional.. I sat on the deck outside for awhile, mulling over all of this and I cried, hugging my legs to my chest as I felt my tears trickle down my currently bare legs.. it felt refreshing. But soon the hair will start to grow again and then it'll all be gone, part of me almost wishes I hadn't, because now I know even more that I'm in the wrong body.

I got a fresh prescription good for a whole year and it's all thanks to you fine folks :)

Around this time last year I fell into a depression and came posting to reddit. Here I received some inspiring words to help cheer me up and some links to places that can help me out.

I ended up on Susan's spending a lot of time idling in IRC. I got a car, figured out how to drive it without hitting anyone, landed a job, obtained a drivers license, all in that order. It was scary as hell and far far outside my personal comfort zone, but I was motivated and determined to change my life for the better.

Then I took what felt like a leap of faith and found my therapist on Twitter. I got lucky, I have phone anxiety. I met with her for the first time two days after my birthday, February 14th.

She's really kind. She's made it clear she's only along for the ride and not here to steer me to where she feels I should be going. I lay out a transition schedule myself. I tell her that first session that I want to start with hormones and transition into fulltime as puberty progresses. She called up an endocrinologist with a warning: the clinic is usually booked months in advanced.

Somehow I got lucky, April Fools was the earliest open appointment. I went back to my therapist many times before that first visit, eventually earned myself a kindly worded letter and just days later was gifted a prescription!

It seemed like such a huge undertaking last year when I was just getting started, but I somehow stayed motivated and just continued to live while slowly making as much progress as I can every day.

I'm now happier than I've ever been, I feel as if I like myself for the first time, and I've lost a significant amount of weight. I was wearing pants sized 38 mens last year, this year I'm down to 31. I've lost 13lb in just the past 3 months and I'm back down to the weight I was at in 2004.

Last time a woman asked if she could bring her boyfriend, and one of us voiced the concern that she wouldn't feel comfortable trying clothes on in the living room with a man there and everyone agreed ""no boys allowed"" including me. Now I know some rude/uninformed people refer to transgender women as though they are men, but it honestly didn't even cross my mind that a transgender woman might think she was excluded as well. I was very disappointed that the lovely transitioning woman I had met the night before(who seemed very excited about the frock swap and confirmed she was attending) didn't show up. A mutual friend of ours had asked me if I thought anyone would mind if she came and I of course answered that anyone who would mind wouldn't be welcome anyway, but I'm afraid we may have inadvertently made her feel unwelcome anyway.

It seems like an issue that would come up in the transgender community more. I apologize in advance for the wall of text, the graphic imagery, and the generally depressed attitude.

I'm 23 and MtF, but pre-everything and still presenting almost exclusively as a male. A couple months ago, I got really drunk at a party with some friends who invited a guy, Ben, back to my place. He was a total dude-bro and a piece of shit who kept insisting we all do shots, to which I obliged. After an hour or so, my friends left, so it was just me and Ben. I was barely conscious at this point, and unable to stand up. Even though Ben had been very insistent he was ""totally not gay"" he started propositioning me. My memory's really blurry at this point. I know I was very insistently saying no, but he was a lot stronger and more sober than. He grabbed my head and made me do things. After that was done, he undressed me. When he saw I was wearing panties he called me a fucking tranny and punched me in the face, flipped me over and penetrated me. Woke up alone and naked a few hours later.

I'm sorry to be so graphic. When I started to write this post, I promised myself I wouldn't go into details, but honestly, it feels really good to actually say this. After the fact, I told my room mates about what happened (they were both out of town that weekend) but I didn't want to bother them with the actual specifics.

I was really lost after the incident. Didn't sleep more than a couple hours a night, stopped eating (I've lost about 15% of my body weight since then) and started doing heroin again. I had only recently started to come out as trans before this happened, but that night set me back several steps. I'd started again to view trans as being dangerous. Everytime I looked in the mirror and saw the bruises, I found myself thinking that this is what happens to people who try to tinker with their gender. Afterwards, I basically decided to go back to being a plain old straight cis male.

I've been going through this alone for the most part. And honestly, I'm proud of how far I've come by myself. I'm sleeping through the night again, my drug use is down to a not-terrible level, and I've even gone out in femme, but I feel like I'm at a standstill now. I need help but don't really know where to get it.

I feel like a surivors support group could be tremendously useful but I can't find any gender-neutral ones. I would like to go to a women's one but that's hardly a possibility. Given that I still present as male, I certainly wouldn't be welcome, and even if I did sonehow manage to pass fully, I wouldn't be able to describe what happened without revealing what parts I have. And even though I AM a woman, I'd still feel like I was invading a safespace. It's really frustrating because on one hand, I want to be mad at the cis-women for misgendering me, but on the other hand, I completely understand why they wouldn't feel safe with me there.

The alternative is a male survivors group, but I wouldn't feel safe there for the same reason I wouldn't be welcomed to a women's group. The thought of talking so vulnerably in a room full of cis, mostly straight, men sounds absolutely terrifying.

Realistically, my best bet is to find one on one counselling, but I'm not sure how viable an option that is. I'm uninsured and underemployed, so that limits my options to pretty much only the therapists that the government would pay for, and I really don't expect them to have therapists who are used to dealing with both sexual assault and trans issues, and I'm really afraid that whoever treats me is going to just make matters worse.

I guess what I'm wondering is if anyone here has any experience with this. I haven't found too many resources on Google (I mean, I've found some great resources, but nothing trans specific) and searching /r/asktransgender turned up nothing. It'd be really great to know that I'm not the only one who's dealing with this. Or if nothing else, it'd be nice to get some e-hugs :/

I've known since I was 4 or 5 that I have some gender dysmorphia but it hasn't ever caused me too many problems. I could be a tomboy and my dad taught me all of the ""boy stuff"" growing up. I did go through a few years of wearing exclusively men's clothes and having short hair, but now I have long hair and wear more form fitting but not necessarily feminine clothes. I've been pretty happy just being an attractive tomboy. Sexuality wise I guess I'm pansexual, I really don't care what a partner was born as I'm just attracted to people although I do seem to be attracted to men more often than women. I've also never had a desire for children. 

Up until this morning I considered my dysmorphia more of quirk than anything else. It's always been fairly mild. I thought briefly about reassignment but it didn't appeal and seemed way more of a hassle than anything else. There are also times I do like being female but usually I don't think about gender much. 

Last night my boyfriend and I were discussing kids, he would like one at some point but is in no rush. We're poly so me not wanting kids is by no means a deal breaker for us like it might be for other people. He's in no way pressuring and although I know he thinks I would be a good mom he is fine if that doesn't happen. The discussion went fairly deep into my reasonings, but it comes down to the thought of being pregnant or nursing horrifies and revolts me so deeply it makes me queasy and inexplicably angry to even think about. My flippant response for years has been I would make a good dad. The talk was casual and one we have had before and eventually we drifted off to sleep.

This morning I woke up and found myself with a very strong desire to have a kid, which has never happened to me before. But not as a woman, I don't want to be a mom. Spending today thinking about it I realized I have a strong desire to be a dad but my feelings about pregnancy are just as strong as ever. I did not expect my emotional reaction to this. I had to take a break (I'm at work) and bawl my eyes out in the parking lot that I will never be a dad. To be clear, this isn't a gender role thing, I have no problem with how masculine I am, or crossing gender roles. I was and am extremely upset that I will never father a child and that the only way I could be a parent is to go through something that I find repugnant beyond belief.

This blind sided me completely. Not only my sudden desire for a kid, but how deep my dysmorphia apparently is, and how very emotional I have gotten over it. I feel so shocked and even devastated by this. It has been years since I put much thought into my gender at all. I'm questioning now whether I've been in denial or what I even am. I still don't have any desire to transition, again it just seems like a hassle. If I could I guess I would just want two different bodies that I could just switch between whenever I felt like it. I guess that makes me gender queer although I've never thought of myself that way.

I don't really know what I'm hoping for out of this post. I guess I'm hoping there are other people out there that can relate or maybe have some kind words to share. I'm going to talk with my boyfriend when I get home, just to air out my feelings. He knows I'm pretty upset and has been awesomely supportive so far. I can't imagine this making much of a difference to him as long as I'm happy. He is a straight, genetic male so I would like get thoughts from people that might be able to relate better.

Well here's an update to it.

I was finally able to ask her why she would tell people something so personal to others, her response was ""Well I thought you wouldn't care seeing as people will know anyway!"" That started a whole conversation in its own, to which she said that she really thought I was joking and was starting her re-joke up (we have always tried to out do each other on jokes) but that she hadn't told anyone because I asked her not to.  So That part was taken care of, until she started crying about the whole thing.  She told me that her son was pretty much dead to her, and she didn't know who was sitting in front of her.  That she had been a prayer request because of the bad news. And to top it off, she wanted to be dead before I started the whole thing and wished I had waited for her to die before hand.  Also she thought she was a bad mother because she didn't see it from an early child hood.

Well I talked to her about it, and told her plain and simple that she was being an ass because I was still me, the only thing changing was the outside.  We talked about the whole her wanting to be dead thing for a bit as well, and she promised that it was just a feeling, and that she would never act on it. (I know she wouldn't we've talked about suicide in passing many of times, in a you know its not the answer way).  I told her that she was a perfect mother, if she wasn't I wouldn't have been comfortable telling her in the first place.  I also told her it was a bit selfish for putting her self on a prayer request.  Over all the whole conversation was worse than coming out to her.  She still thinks I need to know every detail about her (genitals and cycle) before I can start any part of the process.  But the most important thing is, she said that she would get over it all over time and that she loved and supported me no matter what.

Now that all the bad is out of the way, there is some good to the whole thing.  My mother ended up telling my father about everything.  He handled it better than she did, and I was expecting him to be the hardest to deal with.  He said that he thought I was confused and need someone with knowledge in the subject to talk to and that he supported me fully because he loved me. So massive points to dad on that one!!!

Hello fellas. Can you help me with industrial-grade confusion and feels?

Yesterday I was supposed to ""talk"" to my ""boyfriend."" We broke up recently because I thought he'd hate me for what I am and what I want. He was pretty pissed that I didn't try to talk it out - that's fair. Well, we did talk it out, and now he feels much better, but I'm feeling like - like if I had a gun I'd already be gone. I keep thinking of who should get certain things I own and what I can use to end it. I've been depressed before, but this is the worst it's ever been. And all because I agreed that I'd try ""baby steps.""

In the conversation... argument? Unpleasant jumble of shouting and mumbling. He made it clear that even if I'm his best friend, if I transition (""lop my breasts off"") then I'm a making myself a lonely, disgusting freak that he can't see or speak to. He openly admitted that he is transphobic, it's his ""a biological imperative."" He kept referring back to breast-lopping and telling me I'm dealing with my problems like only a woman could, ""by trying to cut them off."" *Men* don't do that, though he didn't explain how men deal with their problems. I guess that men take baby steps, like dress in tomboy chic and get roguish haircuts. I agreed to try for a different look - buying a binder, that sort of thing - to get him to stop saying such hurtful things, but he has all these grand hopes for ""saving me."" I feel hollow and sick to my stomach after being told over and over again that I'm never going to be a man - I fucking know that it won't be magic. But it's better than this existence of hating myself. 

His solutions and words were insulting - his prescriptions included dating a woman (not attracted to women), a haircut, and a new wardrobe because ""current fashions really let a girl dress like a boy."" We even looked at a magazine for what he thought were wholesome semi-masculine fashions. All I wanted was to be like the men in the ads. I don't want clothes that suggest masculinity, I want a flat chest and scruffy jaw and men's clothing. My head is so full of fucks.

I don't know what to do. I can see ""my"" therapist on Wednesday and I notified my dad about thoughts of self-harm, but the words keep echoing around and around in my head and my heart. I'm a freak. Nobody will be my friend. Nobody will love me. Nobody will hire me. I am disgusting. I would rather die than feel all of this forever. I would rather die than try to pretend that dressing up is enough. I have never so much wanted to die, but I am too much of a coward to move in any direction.

I'm not full time and still very much in boy mode. The biggest reason that I've not gone full time is that I don't think I pass very well.

Anyway, I was at a Kinko's getting some copies made and I was wearing a girl’s pastel blue hoodie with a black tshirt under it, no makeup obviously. I am much thinner than most men are so that is a plus to passing I think. My hair has grown out but it's really not styled in a feminine style yet. I guess the things that I think I have going for me are my eyes, which have gotten very feminine looking and my facial skin. But overall I still feel like I look like a guy. I've been working on my voice but I was using what I thought was my boy voice. 

So the clerk greeted me and asks how I was doing and I replied. Keep in mind I’m very self-conscious and was not in anyway trying to be feminine. I smiled and told him fine and I asked about a certain paper for my copies.  He said “Let me check that man” and goes to looking in a book. He finds the answer and says “Ok man I found it, it will be….bla bla bla”. I ask another question and he replies “Yes Ma’am”. It hit me he was not saying man but Ma’am the whole time. I was totally caught off guard and immediately felt like everyone in the store was focused on me. I quickly finished up and practically ran out of the store.  I got to my car and stared into the rear view mirror for a few minutes trying to see what he saw. I still have no clue but he was not hesitant or undecided, he thought I was a woman.  

Please don’t take this as a “Look at me, I pass thread”, I’m really curious if everyone goes through this stage where you feel ugly and manly and just know you don’t pass and yet somehow magically you do? 

And tell me your stories if you have ever passed when you really should not have in boy mode.

1319131339.0,28,self.asktransgender,liwam,Consultation with Toby Meltzer for metoidioplasty/scrotoplasty - a report,catamorphism,31,3,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/liwam/consultation_with_toby_meltzer_for/,"Since I don't see a lot of guys talking about bottom surgery here, I thought I would post about my experience seeing Toby Meltzer for a consultation about metoidioplasty and scrotoplasty this past Monday. (I also posted this to a mailing list I'm on, so sorry if anyone sees it twice!)

I really liked Meltzer; he didn't seem to have the usual arrogant-doctor attitude. Plus he was wearing a pink shirt under his suit, which is always a plus for guys :-D

I liked that he didn't start by launching into a standard spiel about the surgery, and seemed to assume I'd already done my research. Instead, he saw that I had a notebook, and just asked what questions I had. I started by asking him about keloids or hypertrophic scars, since I have a tendency to form those. He said that he'd never seen those happen as a result of genital surgery, and for some reason, that area of the body just doesn't tend to form hypertrophic scars. So that was reassuring.

I explained the setup I wanted (simple meta with scrotoplasty and implants, but no v-ectomy and no UL) and it sounded like this was something he was used to hearing. It sounds like he's done a ton of these surgeries and he said that with simple meta, he'd never had serious complications and never had anyone lose sensation. I asked about having UL in the future in case I changed my mind, and he said that while he thought it worked slightly better to do the UL and meta at the same time (fewer complications), he had also had good results doing it later. So that was good too. He said he only does UL with a complete v-ectomy (something I more or less knew already but I wanted to confirm) because if he didn't do the v-ectomy, the vaginal opening would be left very narrow and ""wouldn't be too useful to anyone"". That was a bit disappointing to me, but I wasn't planning on getting UL now anyway...

He said that almost everything could be done as one surgery (the meta itself, mons resection, and scrotoplasty) but I would have to come back in 4-5 months for a second surgery to put the permanent implants in; that's how long he said it usually takes to let the scrotal expanders do their work. He also said expanders were optional but he tried to encourage people to have them. For the meta, I had the option of staying one night in the hospital, or going to a hotel if I had somebody with me, but it sounded a bit safer to me to stay in the hospital.

I asked about the urinary issues I've had since starting HRT (basically  like a feeling of having a narrowed urethra and very frequent urination) and whether if I did ever get UL, that would make it better or worse. He said that it could only possibly make it worse (bummer) but there were a couple different issues that could be causing it and it would be better if I saw a urologist (who was better than the one I saw before who'd never seen a trans guy) to figure out what's going on.

Finally, I asked about recovery time: 1 week to return to work, 2 weeks for exercise. He said he recommended staying in Scottsdale for about 5 days, post-surgery, especially if I didn't have anyone with me, but that some people had stayed for less time.

I liked that he didn't say anything about my weight (although there is a comment on his web site to the extent that the results are best if you're ""near your ideal weight"" -- well, I am near the weight that's ideal for my body, but I don't think that's what he means) and also that he didn't ask any gatekeepery questions at all. Based on filling out the online questionnaire for his office, I was afraid of heavy gatekeeping (from its use of terms like ""RLE"" and such) but he didn't ask me a thing about how long I've been living ""as a man"" or anything of that nature. All he asked was how long I'd been on testosterone, and that of course is relevant to the surgery I want.

Then I showed my two therapists' letters to the surgery scheduler and she said they would call to verify the letters and then I would be able to put down a deposit for a surgery date. She tentatively scheduled a date for me right then (in February). I was afraid the ""verification"" would also be a lengthy process, but no! The next morning I had a voicemail from the office, and when I returned it, she said that they had verified the letters and I could go ahead and pay the deposit, so I did. Right now I'm scheduled for February 13. 

I'm thinking of postponing it till the summer, though, as the friend who's willing to come with me is a student and won't be available till then. For anyone who's read this far and has had a meta with no UL: how important is it to have someone with you post-surgery? I know I'm really glad I had someone come with me after I had top surgery, but when I had that I didn't spend the night in the hospital.

Meltzer is the only surgeon I've seen about lower surgery, but I think I'm fine with just going ahead and going to him; he's done a ton of these surgeries and he also seems to care about our community. As far as the other North American options goes, I know I'll get turned away from many of the others because of my weight, and I only have so much patience for dealing with fatphobic doctors anyway; and I don't want to see Marci Bowers because I'm not comfortable with seeing anyone who's associated with Anne Lawrence. So it feels slightly nerve-wracking to just go with the first surgeon I saw (after consulting with four different ones for top surgery), but on the other hand I really want to go ahead and do this and I can't see it going wrong easily.

As far as financing, I've resigned myself to borrowing the money to pay for surgery; I'm unemployed right now, and uninsured, but I do start a job in January, so I'll be able to pay it back. I also won't be insured through that job until April (if ever) and I know the insurance isn't trans-inclusive; I'd like to fight for coverage, but for others' benefit; I think it'll drive me to the brink if I put off my own surgery until my employer starts covering it, since that might never happen.

Disclaimer: I'm MtF, so you know who this guide is mainly focused on, for FtM advice see the bottom. Most of this is general though.

The easiest way to buy is obviously online as long as you have the money and whoever is at the shipping address other than yourself is okay with or doesn't care about what you are doing. My situation is easy, my parents know and are very helpful with everything. **A lot of people aren't this lucky, so this is for you**. If you CAN find a friend you can have things shipped to for you. If not, a P.O. Box may be possible, if that's not the case you might be out of luck. Really you may have to stick to in person shopping.

For buying clothes in person things can be VERY awkward, but usually only if you let them. A good option is to go with a friend of your chosen gender so that it looks like you are helping them, a boyfriend or girlfriend works, I've even gone shopping with my sister (and our mom's cash). Another thing you can do is **DON'T WORRY** about it. The sales people at any clothing store will be used to people buying clothes for the opposite gender and sex all the time. You do not need to explain yourself, but always be polite if they ask a question. Chances are they only want to make small talk, always be nice to sales people.

Maybe the hardest thing is trying to buy women's underwear. I don't know about the difficulty of men's, but some of this may apply. Obviously there's a lot more variety on the women's side, and more things to remember. Look around online first to learn the terminology, what kind of bra? What size? Measure your waist and find the right sizing for you. Now, you might be thinking of going to a place like Victoria's Secret, and I actually advise this. You may be the only *perceived* male in the store, depending on how you present, but chances are you aren't the first nor last.

Plenty of husbands and boyfriends go in to buy wives and girlfriends things. If someone asks you who it is for you can tell them whatever you want. I find the set up to be very relaxed and calm. If you're confused, feel free to ask for help, tell them what you think you are looking for. Chances are they will assume it is for some sort of significant other and they may even give you some advice.

Right, for the FtM's out there, I'm sorry you get so little attention in things. ""Men's Clothing Stores"" usually focus in business and formal wear. Otherwise the men's department in any clothing store is what you want. Sizing will not account for hips at all, you basically have waist and height. The biggest trouble may be if you don't fall into a wide enough or tall enough measure. I have a very skinny waist and always struggled to find pants for my school uniform. If you are positive it is worth your money, check online. I've had to order pants from Land's End for school to get the proper length and width.

i'm also not asking for any kind of monetary compensation, so again please don't talk about or offer it.

Also within the FtM community I find most of them are gay. So as a straight FtM where do I go to find bros?! My therapist said I should join a support group. I tried 2 in my area. The first  group was a lot of gay FtM, and while I'm not homophobic it's a little hard for me to spend my Thursdays listening to a bunch of dudes talking about their boyfriends. The second group I was the only FtM there, and the trans women there kept confusing me for a young MtF which was embarrassing!

My solution? At least there's porn! Because there's porn of everything right? Nah. Almost all porn featuring ftm is gay too! 

I talked to some of my closest peers about why things were this way. It was implied that going on T ""Makes you cockhungry"" I really balked at that and the implication somehow my going on T was going to alter my sexuality.

**Do you think that a trans person will ever physically be 100% a ""real"" man or woman? Why or why not?**

I feel like I've argued this again and again. If GRS does not change our bodies to match our gender identity, then what exactly are we doing? Hormones change secondary sex characteristics. SRS changes the primary sex characteristics, with the exception of the internal sex organs needed to give birth. So...what is it that makes trans men and women not ""truly"" their sex?

**Warning: rant-ish thing ahead**

It can't be chromosomes because [some men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XX_male_syndrome) are born with XX chromosomes and [some women](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome) are born with XY chromosomes. Plus, who really gets their chromosomes checked, anyways?

It can't be hormones because a trans men will have the same levels as a cis man and a trans woman will have the same levels as a cis woman, if they are on HRT. And hormones control [secondary sex characteristics](http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/secondary-sex-characteristics.htm). So, at that point, unless you're having sex with that person, it's basically impossible to tell a trans person apart from a cis person.

It can't be primary sex characteristics because some cis men have [internal female organs](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/female-organs-found-in-a-man-in-madhya-pradesh/1/146887.html), [breasts](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/gynecomastia/DS00850), and [no penis](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/man-penis-miracle-member-surgery-article-1.1291724). Some cis women have [internal male organs](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-11/24/content_497556.htm), [no breasts](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263264.php) (or they [lose them](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10055693/Angelina-Jolie-wont-be-any-less-of-a-woman-without-breasts.html)), or [no vagina](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/teen-girl-vagina-pregnant-sperm-survival-oral-sex/story?id=9732562).

Some people think that a metoidioplasty or a phalloplasty for a trans man doesn't result in a ""real"" penis, or that a vaginoplasty doesn't result in a ""real"" vagina. What makes a metoidioplasty made penis different from a man with a [micropenis](http://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-Micropenis.aspx) (especially a guy like [this](http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/health/2013/06/06/man-with-micropenis-discovers-hes-actually-woman-at-age-66/)?) How is a phalloplasty made penis different from a man with [erectile dysfunction](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/erectile-dysfunction/DS00162)? How is a vaginoplasty made vagina different from a cis woman's vagina?

And what makes a post op trans person different from a cis person who's [sterile](http://www.abc.net.au/health/library/stories/2007/05/30/1919840.htm#.Ufv_D5L2aSo)?

**/End Rant**

I understand that for some people, being sterile or having a penis that's too small or can't get hard on its own is a problem. But shouldn't that person still be judged like any other person without having their ""real"" sex called into question? Why is being trans something that must, absolutely, 100% be disclosed to every partner we have post-op unless we are *not* physically that sex?

I want to know the opinions of other people on this. I think it's obvious what my opinion is, but what about you guys? Do you think I'm full of crap? Do you have anything else to add?

To me...once I get my meta, I see no reason that I would be forced to bring up being trans. If a guy wants to reject me because my penis isn't big enough, then he can do that. But, in that sense, he's judging me as a man. I've always been a man. I always will be. I don't see why some body problems I had in the past should come into play, personally. Am I wrong to think that?

I'm very attracted to women who were born with male genetalia and I am not 100% sure why that matters to me.

   I had a crush on someone who transitioned, before I knew she was trans and before she started taking steps to transition, while I was in middle school. As she began transitioning I was much more into her, for some reason I can't really explain. Maybe it's just simply one of the things I'm attracted to and there is no real explanation. Anyways, I think that's what mostly started my romantic and sexual interest in trans women.

   I work on adult webcam sites and make pornography, and I know and talk to a friend who happens to be trans who does the same and lives in the same state (though, about five hours away.) She wants to make porn with me and cam with me, which I'm totally into. I just get a little worried that I am disgusting to a type of person I'm attracted to because they may consider me a chaser.

1. What is it like, after a lifetime in a male body, to wake up every morning as a woman? And to know that it will be this way for the rest of your life?

2. Are you happy with yourself now? What did it take to be?

3. Did you turn out the way you wanted and if not, how do you feel about that?

4. When you look into the mirror, is there still a guy there sometimes, or could you leave that part of your live behind?

5. Is that constant nagging in your soul about your body/identity gone? Do you feel more free?

I'm this freaking close to just...killing myself because I  can't take this disappointment. I'm so freaking depressed...
I can make it legitimately obvious I have boobs, and they can hear my voice...but they see my face... ""oh that's a man""

I haven't changed my name legally yet, so I can just go back to being a ""man"" without any real repercussions. I won't stop HRT though...

The only reason I haven't already is because I'm living in a homeless shelter for women. I have to stay  or at least appear to be transfemale to stay here.

I don't have any family or friends or anyone I can go live with. I don't have the greatest of education and I have bipolar disorder.

I'm just... so disappointed at the results. I've been on HRT for like 15 months now. nothing has changed except maybe my ass looks more womanly and I have...half A cup boobs...
THATS IT.
I don't have money for facial feminization surgery, I don't have money for SRS or a boob job, I don't have money period...

Essentially, I'm posting here, because I have a boatload of questions, and I felt I might have got on the nerves of a user if I continued to PM her my questions. &gt;_&gt;

Should probably give a bit of information, because it may be relevant in a few questions I have. I'm 15 in a few days, certain that I'm trans, recently just came out to my mother, in England and have an appointment with my GP on Tuesday.


And now I'll just dump all my questions here? I'm not sure... I've probably done something wrong, but here goes:


Firstly, I was just wondering if anyone had a few tips or anything to avoid getting gate-kept. I already know the basics, like make sure you don't have any mental conditions or stuff, because they always want to get that sorted first, and to say that I only like guys (I'm pansexual, if that's at all relevant.) until I get an idea of my doctor's personal belief on trans girls who don't *exclusively* like guys, etc, but was hoping for tips that could, possibly, work in my favour? Like, something you might have said to your doctor which they reacted positively to, and it sped things along? I don't exactly know what I'm expecting in answer to this, sorry.


Next, I wanted to know whether the NHS still do RLE, because I've tried finding out, but different sources state different things, and don't tend to agree with each other. The general consensus was that they don't usually, but sometimes do. Also, what is RLE? Is it just going in public in woman's clothes? (if so, I don't really see how that proves anything :/ )


And lastly, partners. I've talked to someone about this, but we live in slightly different places, and people there seem to be a lot more accepting, but could just be my imagination. I just wanted to know, like... Should you basically just not get a boyfriend/girlfriend before SRS? Because they would either have no attraction to your genitals for several years, and then would do after the surgery, or vice versa. Also, never really had a relationship, and this complicates thing so much, would it just be better to wait until I can ""pass"" as a woman or until the surgery to pursue relationships? Otherwise I may get a different view of relationships than the reality? I don't know. Even *I* can't follow my own train of thought. Sorry. Please excuse nervousness and awkwardness.
Not at all the only questions I have, but think I should stop here, or I'll just be all messy and all over the place. If you feel in the mood to answer some more very awkwardly phrased questions, ask. I've got too many in my head.
Sorry if I've broken some rules or something.

This started out as a reply to a spcific post and got too long. After finding this subreddit I want to respond to everyone and do my best to help!

This might better fit /transsupport but I want to know that people with problems will see this and I encourage you to read the other trans subreddits as they will provide a lot of help. More than I could ever give.
 
I know it sounds difficult, but there is no way to ""test"" or ""find out"" you are trans. This is a personal journey. Don't worry about how other people are labeling you and have the courage to label yourself.

If you want to be a woman/man; if you feel you are a woman/man; if you feel uncomfortable as a man/woman; if you think transitioning would end this dysphoria; do it. Don't second guess, wondering if you could be wrong. You'll never try.

From what I've read and experienced, severe negativity and depression surrounding this subject and the act of asking for help spawns from dysphoria. 

(I'm not diagnosing anyone. I am not a doctor. I am simply seeing the exact same feelings expressed in this subreddit I was experiencing in my situation.)

NEVER feel bad for feeling bad. Yes, this can seem like first world problems. Yes, you may have a great life. Yes, it's true you there is no reason to feel bad. These are all reasons WHY depression is such a horrible condition. I felt like a complete asshole with no right to live for complaining that I ""felt bad"" when I rightly had no reason to. Depression is debilitating and not something to chastise yourself for. Please try to see that there's no reason for this negativity when trying to overcome depression. It only makes it worse. Listening to [Stephen Fry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2Ta0yFoNG8) speak about his battles helped me take the first steps to resolving feelings like these.

If you want to transition, the first step is saying, ""yes, I want to try."" Just try that. Try. Don't think about jumping in all at once. That makes the problem that much larger and imposing. The process takes several years to even begin and will last the rest of your life, so don't make the first step larger than it need be.

Second, tell someone close to you. This step will be the hardest. After you admit it to yourself, you will need a support group if you are serious about continuing. Several people without the social ties to lean on in the process don't make it. They quit, or have been know to commit suicide. Don't think you need to rely only on yourself. There are people out there who will love you and support you and assist you on your journey. Yes, you risk losing friends who do not understand and are intolerant. However, you will find better ones who are truly close to you, who are truly accepting. I was lucky enough to have nothing but an outpouring of support emotionally and financially from my friends. I am truly blessed in this regard, but that does not mean I wasn't frightened. I didn't know who to turn to at first and did not want to lose the people I was close to. You must try.

Third, I was independent of my family at 24 when I started, attending college. However, I was on my family insurance and this will make the process easier, as most plans will cover counseling and/or medication.

If young, on your own, or not at Uni, do a quick google search for trans forums asking for Trans friendly psychologists/endocrinologists. They are plentiful and are 1)easier to get letters from, quicker and 2)usually give discounts on their services to trans or provide low income counseling alternatives.

If in university, you should also have some insurance as a student. Go to the GLBT groups/counselors on your campus or the university health center and simply tell them ""I want to speak with someone who is qualified to write a letter of recommendation letter for hormone replacement therapy."" Be strong. Be direct. Transitioning involves much more than hormones, but they play a very integral part and should be your first real step. **Starting hormones sooner than later is key.** You need to stop puberty as soon as possible. It is VERY hard hide (and for MTF) **impossible** to reverse.

Now, note that thus far you have not yet done anything irreversible. All of this up until now will simply reaffirm your decision and help you ask questions: this is right for you? and do you really want to got through with it?

Seeing a counselor should not take long and they will help you with this process. DO NOT think of this negatively. Many people (I might argue rightly so) think of a counselor as just another hurdle that you need to mount in order to get to your goal of hormones. I had an EXTREMELY NEGATIVE view of counselors before I began this process. Do not think you need to deceive them. Do not think they are there to stop you. They are there to HELP and to assure that you simply have the right mental health, support group, and that you are sure about this transition. All they want is your health and safety. **Please do not self medicate. I do not support or condone this. It is dangerous and costly.** See a couselor and they will HELP. These youtubers [Jordan here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWTXsXoW5l8) [and here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=budykK4he-k), [Kylee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_IN08eHoE0) and [Joules](http://www.youtube.com/user/princessjoules) were great resources starting out.

This all will take some time. During that time you will have the luxury of thinking it through and asking questions and talking to people who love you and want to help. please Please PLEASE seriously think about starting soon with that first step. Please try to realize (and I know this sounds horrible and hard and like I don't understand (and I know that I **don't** understand your situation but am making generalizations and trying to help)) that it's ok to feel bad. I'm not going to say cheer up and don't be sad. That's impossible. Just feel better about feeling bad (if that makes any sense) when you know you have no reason. The future can look bleak and opaque and really, nonexistent.

Myself, I saw a LGBT focused psychologist AND a psychiatrist at first. I went on antidepressants at first just to make sure I couldn't cure my dysphoria with simple counseling and medication, knowing that I was trans at heart, but accepting that and continue to live my life as a man. The medication helped in two ways. It brought my mood and quality of life in check and that in turn helped my think more clearly and say to myself ""Yes. I am trans. Yes, I want to transition.""

I don't understand it. Last Friday, they gave me 30 days to improve. They said shape up or ship out.

Well this week I busted my ass. I did everything I could. I was barely on the internet at all. I approached every assignment with efficiency and total effort. I did everything they asked me to do. I was only ever on the net when I was waiting for my boss to hand me a new assignment. 

They said they checked the internet logs and found them way too excessive, but why didn't they do that before last week's meeting. I just don't fucking get it. If they had let me go last week, fine, I would be like ""oh well, I deserve it, I fucked up."" But to tell me I still have a chance to improve, then can me a week later when I've been an exemplary employee? What the ever-loving fuck? ;_;

I don't know the real reason they fired me, I have no idea. Maybe it's because two weeks ago I asked for a month's leave for SRS. Maybe they read my internet logs and saw me applying for other jobs. I don't fucking know. Thankfully I took Heterogenic's advice and started applying for other jobs. I actually got a decent amount of interest. 

I had one interview this morning with a company, and the interview actually went amazingly well. They seemed very interested. They may even be making an offer by the end of the day today. We'll see, I hope. I would love to be able to say I lost a job and was hired on the same day. I also have another company interested in doing an interview next week. 

I don't really know what I'm asking for here. Just...God. How could they do that? 

I don't know. Hopefully a job will come out of this process. If not, fuck it. Between my tutoring side job and the rooms I rent out, I make enough to cover basic expenses like mortgage, utilities, etc. 

I have more than enough credit lined up to cover the SRS trip in June. I'm just going to borrow whatever money I need to do it, and if I'm stuck forever without a good engineering job, I'll just bankrupt it all. Let the evil banks be left holding the bag. I don't care about my credit. I already have a mortgage which I can pay without a regular job. Fuck it. I'm getting this transition done and over with, even if it completely wrecks my credit.

I've never had any trouble performing sexually, I enjoy sex as the masculine/dominant/penetrative partner, which is part of my lesbian fantasies (*she* is always a fairly butch lesbian), but the actual fact of life of being a man is depressing.

A transman tried to join a woman's only discussion board that I am a part of and was rejected. This board accepts all lesbian/bi women, including transwomen, but does not allow any men or male-identified folk. Rejecting the transman who tried to join has become quite a dramatic scandal on the board with moderators threatening to resign, etc, etc. Some members have called other members transphobic for not allowing this man into the group. They don't want to let queer cismen in, however.

There was a suggestion about having bodily transition points for transmembers. I find that unseemly because it seems to negate and reject the transpeople who can't afford surgeries and hormones. It also seems to send a message to the transwomen by saying that we consider a dude, who still has a vagina, more of a lady than a transwoman without surgery. That seems very mean. However, I've only known like three trans people so what do I know? 

I feel like an idiot because I don't understand but some of the discourse over this issue is rubbing me the wrong way. A lot of problematic language and undertones of this weird misogyny has appeared in the discussions. I'm not the most knowledgeable about gender studies and queer issues so I'm hesitant about asking questions there. There is a vote on whether or not to let transmen in (but not queer cismen) and I don't think that I can vote because I am too ignorant on the subject. I also feel bad because I liked that it was a safe woman's space and that is what attracted me to the group. I'm just a simple country lesbian who's there for the dames and the company. 

I'm probably inadvertently using the wrong language all over this post. I apologize if I am. If this is not the place for the question then I will delete this post. 

Edit: Thank you for all your wonderful and insightful comments! I so appreciate that ya'll took time to let me know your perspectives. You've really given me a lot of food for thought. I feel like I have learned a lot so thank you for that gift. I will respond to you all tomorrow. :D

EDIT2: Its just a generalized queer woman's social club for a specific city where people post stuff about starting book clubs and having potluck dinners. There are other LGBT groups in the city but this is the only queer woman's group. 

EDIT3: I'd like to quote you folks in a post in the discussion because it doesn't seem like many trans voices have been heard in this debate. I feel like this would be more educational and informative than the debate go-round that has been going on. Please let me know if that would be unacceptable. Thank you. 

UPDATE: The vote was really close (four votes) but the conclusion that the group should stay woman identified-only. There are a number of people who are quitting because they see it as a disgusting display of transphobia. Then there are the people who have faded out because they don't like conflict. I get the feeling that the point might be moot in a few months because it seems like too many are jumping ship to keep the group going. After reflecting on what I read here, I wrote this in the board before the vote closed.

*[I cited a quote from the mod] at what point Female to Males will be rejected. It is as soon as they believe they are trans? Is it when they start taking Testosterone? Is it when they have some form of surgery? If a really butch female requests to join...are we to ask that they prove there not transgendered*

&gt;I'd like some clarification on this because well, this seems like you are confusing someone's fashion choices with their gender identity. Just because a woman dresses in denim and has short hair doesn't make her any less of a woman. Just as a man in tight pink pants with a scarf is no longer a man. I have long hair and wear skirts but that doesn't make me more of a lady than a woman with a buzz cut and trousers on. The feminine essence and spirit transcends that just as the masculine one does.

&gt;In any case, a transman is a man and should be treated as such. I don't know what surgery and hormones have to do with it. That's expensive and out of reach for some transmen. That puts a undue emphasis on a transperson's body than their mind and soul in determining their identity. If we are to not accept any masculine identified people, then we should respect a transmen's identity and not accept him for membership. If the group is to be opened to the masculine end of the spectrum, then of course, transmen should be included. 

&gt;Transwomen are women and such applicants should be treated accordingly as well regardless of her transition point or fashion choices. Our trans-sisters deserve a safe lady space as much as any other woman. I think having transition points for accepting transgendered members sends the wrong message to potential transwomen wanting to join especially if they do not have the financial means to reach the arbitrary bodily goals. A person's body doesn't necessarily determine their identity and having transition points for membership endorses the notion that it does. 

&gt;I'll be honest, it sounds like this group is doing more of a disservice to the trans community by sending the message that a transman is still some kind of a woman or not quite man enough to be excluded. This all seems more problematic than just having a simple 'no men allowed' policy. I have to agree with [another mod] that it seems like we wouldn't be affirming a transman's identity by letting him into a girl's club, if we wouldn't let a cisman. Its pretty much saying that we don't considering him a man. 

&gt;My words have less merit as a cisperson so I talked to some transpeople online to get their perspective. [then I quoted some of you]

This is the worst part about switching full-time, especially so suddenly. Girls build a wardrobe over the course of their entire lifetime, constantly switching things out and trading clothes. I've tossed out a lifetime of clothes to start from scratch. This is going to be so expensive. To make matters worse, I'm going on a cruise in two weeks and need some formalwear too! At the same time, it's really exciting. It's fantastic to be able to just ""do over"" your life and build a new wardrobe with a new style from scratch, obliterating any old aspects of your style that you didn't care about.

I have some girlfriends who want to have a clothes exchange soon, and we're going shopping before the cruise as well, so that'll help! And maybe I can borrow something more formal (dresses I guess?) from some of them, but good lord is this daunting!

I'm not even really sure what my plan was when I decided to come out and switch over, I didn't really have one — and I don't regret it! — but I kinda wish I had thought this through, ahaha

I let my hair get long, way too long. Definitely not my style. When its weight and length was causing it to part in ways that made it look distinctly masculine despite it being so long, I finally lost it and ran out today for a last minute appointment to get it cut. I wanted something fun, lively, and androgynous since I just recently started hormones, something I might be able to work with as I spend the next months coming out.

I called the JCPenney salon I've had lots of luck with so far, asked who was good with punky, androgynous cuts, and ran out to get there in time. However, not only did I have to explain what I meant by ""androgynous"" to the stylist when she kept showing me masculine cuts that would do a wonderful job at showing off way too much forehead, it kept to a point where as a desperate move to get what I wanted and make her realize what I was going for, I leaned in and in a low voice told her I was trans, that whatever I got, it COULD NOT be masculine, and I wanted something punky, fun, layered to keep the weight off my face and help round out features, and somewhat short because long lines make me look tired.

And that, apparently, was my tree topper for my melange of bad ideas today, because after she started cutting my hair, she started talking about her ""nephew"", and how ""he"" transitioned, even got the full surgery, and now makes a prettier woman than she did at ""his"" age. When I tried to further say what I wanted for layering, for styling, I was always contradicted with, ""But *this* way is more feminine."" I never said I wanted feminine, I'm not a girly-girl, I'm just not at all male. I then got stories of how one of the other stylists at the place went out and did drag every Halloween, I got asked ""when"" I was going to have ""the surgery"", as if it was both inevitable and any of her fucking business; and finally I got to listen to the stylist's methods of raising her kids, which included verbal teasing and harassment so they could ""learn how to deal with it"", like how she calls one of her heterosexual sons a fag all the time, and how she calls her 9 year old son who looks Middle Eastern ""Osama Bin-Laden"", and ""hassam"" to tease him about his looks. This son *actually showed up*, and I think that was the worst part, because not only did she call him, ""Hassam"", I got to hear his pained reaction of, ""I told you not to call me that,"" and her further reply of telling him he needs to learn to deal with it, and that he was such a big baby. It was an immediate reminder of how my own family members would tease me to tears when I was little, and then tease me for crying. So it was a hair cut with a lovely side of PTSD.

I didn't even know what to say, or do. I mean, it's hard to even be confrontational to what's turned out to be a careless, psycho-bitch with scissors bouncing around your head. On top of that, she was a bad stylist and just wasn't paying attention to what I was asking. I held back on correcting her over how she gendered her niece because I told myself I didn't know what type of relationship they have, maybe her niece doesn't care. But then I was just shell-shocked, PTSD style when she so blithely helped me relive the emotional abuse of my own childhood by openly mocking her son, and by further mocking his dislike of it.

I just stopped talking, I wasn't even looking in the mirror, I was just waiting for her to be done so I could go. If she asked something, I said it was fine. I still can't look at my hair cut critically, thankfully I didn't cut it very short. I ran out of there, went home, ordered comfort food, and just mindlessly played games while sipping rum and coke until I could stop thinking about it for a little bit. 

I don't know what to do now. I want to complain to the salon, or just JCPenney's in general, but I also feel like it's just complaining about this woman talking about her family, but on the other hand it was in a particularly heinous way. I mean...I hate feeling just run over like this, and this feels like just the situation where I sabotage myself into feeling guilty about my own reaction, but what's the right thing to do?

What do you do when you come across a stranger that you are certain or suspect is trans?  I'm also trans and sometimes my instinct is that I want to talk to them (if they seem like the kind of person who I could be friends with).  I'd love to hang out and get coffee and talk about things.  Is it OK to approach someone and just ask if they want to hang out?  I feel like the main drawback is that they may not want to be identified as trans and don't want people approaching them especially because of being trans.  I often feel the same way.  Is there a way to do that without risking hurting feelings?  Or should I just let it go as I have been doing?

It's not about support.  I have navigated through the time in my life where I needed support.  I don't really even have a desire to know or be friends with all of the trans people in my city.  I've mets lots of trans people and I usually don't find any connection that makes me want to be friends with all of them.  But I would hate to miss an opportunity to find someone that is trans that actually could be a friend of mine.  I like having the few transgender friends that I have and I like talking to them about their lives and mine, so meeting another friend would be cool!  I just don't know if it could be done by chance in public (which is how most people meet I think!)

But:

I stop by at the store where my wife works yesterday. A friend of hers also had come by, and brought by his dad, who I guess was in town. Let's call the guy's father John, because I don't remember his actual name. My wife rings John up and says, oh, by the way, ""this is my lovely wife Andi"". John shakes my hand, and then asks--

""So... did you get married back when it was still legal, or...?""

...he hasn't perceived us as anything other than a normal lesbian couple, and he's asking us if we got married before the prop.8 deadline. We just sort of stammer. Eventually my wife says something like ""our legal situation is complicated... we're from Texas"", and he nods knowingly. (We incidentally *are* from Texas; and our legal situation *is* complicated.) John goes on to happily talk about his niece whose commitment ceremony he attended recently. He eventually leaves and we just look at each other and burst out laughing.

...so, this was overall a good interaction, but... unexpected. How exactly do you go about *answering* that question? It's a natural question to come up, I mean, people are curious.

I think I'd been thinking, if I ever got into this situation, I'd just say ""it was still legal at the time we got married"", which is accurate. However the precise way this guy asked the question, I feel like that response would have been misleading.

The other solution is to just say I'm trans and it was legal because I was legally male in the state and at the time we were married. But the problem is... well, I'm not interested in ""stealth"", I tell people I'm trans when it's relevant and I don't hide it online, but sometimes I don't want to necessarily tell every single person I meet? It gets exhausting. I'm trying to walk a tightrope of not hiding my past (I'm not ashamed) but not feeling obligated to volunteer it always forever either.

An idea occurred to me during a conversation with a friend of mine.  She was talking about how at her job (she does over-the-phone computer repair and assistance), since transitioning she's being taken less seriously.  Like a few times she's gone to talk people through fixing whatever problem they have and they treated her like a receptionist, and she needed to transfer them to the ""real"" rep.  They hear a woman and assume she doesn't know anything about computers.  There's other things too, like the staple ""go back to the kitchen where you belong"" kinda stuff.  And not based on being trans, but on being a woman (sexist, not transist?).

As for me, what she's going through are things I've lived with and gotten used to over my life; stereotypes and assumptions about me based on sex.  So it barely fazes me anymore, but for my friend it seemed like something she wasn't really aware of (at least in terms of experiencing it directly), much less prepared for.

So I guess my question would be; during and/or after transitioning, are/were there noticeable shifts in sexist or sex-based stereotypes, discriminations or assumptions about you that you weren't expecting?  I ask because like I said, there's a certain way I'm used to being treated and looked at.  I may not like it, but it's not *new*, y'know?  I don't know how it feels to suddenly have that turn around or change dramatically, and I can't really imagine it.

I’m a cisgender, pansexual woman in my 20s, and I’m hoping for some advice on how to explain to my conservative parents that I’m dating a transwoman. To clarify, she’s only recently begun transitioning, and still generally presents as male when we’re in public (unless we’re in a safe space or she’s feeling particularly brave). 

My parents are Catholic, politically conservative, and have previously compared homosexuality to bestiality, and have made comments about how LGBT persons shouldn’t be afforded equal rights. I originally came out to them as a lesbian when I was very young, and while they weren’t openly hostile about it, I faced a lot of cold detachment, withdrawal of parental affection, etc. In recent years, our relationship has improved substantially, and they’ve become unconditionally loving and supportive again. However, I’m worried that they’ve begun acting this way in response to me beginning to date men – that they think I’m becoming straight? I tried to explain to them that my feelings about women haven’t changed, but I don’t know if they listened or believed me.

Anyway, my parents have already met my “boyfriend” and “his” family, and have been very approving and supportive of our relationship. But how do I take the next step, and tell them that my “boyfriend” is really my transgender girlfriend? I love my girlfriend deeply, and I want to be with her for the long haul. Regardless of my parents’ reaction, I’m going to stay with her. But at the same time, I love my family, and I love that we’ve reconnected. I don’t want to have to lose the support of my parents. 

Do you have any advice for how to talk to my parents about my girlfriend transitioning, maybe in a gentle or non-confrontational way so we can have a real conversation and they won’t just shut down?

PS: My girlfriend’s family is aware of and supporting her transition, just fyi.

Puberty starting?,123eThrowaway,27,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/qy344/3_months_on_hormones_puberty_starting/,"So, I am 23 and on 1mg of estradial twice a day (2 total)  and 100 mg of spiro twice a day (200 total).  

I'm loving the physical changes, they're happening very fast and they make me feel so much better in my body.  However, I wondering about what its doing to my mind... How much of it is real, whats placebo, and etc. I was wondering if all of you could help me sort out whats actually probably changing and whats just in my head.

Before hormones, I largely identified as asexual with an emotional attraction to girls. I was completely apathetic to my privates.  I wasn't exactly dom, but I wasn't a sub either.  In my last relationship (which was my first), I was the one who held, who was in control, who was, essentially, the male role.  It didn't bug me until the end of the relationship.   I had ZERO attraction to men.  Emotionally or physically.  

After hormones?  Right now, I am still largely asexual and I am still *emotionally* attracted to girls.  But I've started to have rather intense feeling of wanted to be penetrated from the front.  I can visualize it and almost feel it.  It because so intensely real that it kind of scares me. I am still apathetic to the idea of having male junk, but I am starting to really want FEMALE bits.  Really, really bad. ANd guys...?  Well, I still feel no emotional connection to them, yet, but I think I am starting to become physically attracted.  Or maybe I just really like the idea of penetration...  And the most intense change, mentally, has been my moving from the position of a ""switch"" to CLEARLY sub.  Like, incredibly sub.  I don't think I could pull of dom even if I wanted to, haha.  I went from being the one who held to wanting to be held.  To be kissed, felt, caressed...  I almost never had that in my last relationship, and it was ok.  But now, I really feel like I *need* these forms of affection from my partner.  

There are other changes that are obviously caused by hormones, so I wont go into those.  But the rest of this...  Is it normal?  Is it normal for *any* girl, not just trans?  Is it just made up in my head? 
Who should I focus on dating?  I think I'd have a better emotional relationship with a girl, and there are always strap-ons...

1328211260.0,26,self.asktransgender,p83br,At a loss over transgendered friend,ihateblueskittles,28,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/p83br/at_a_loss_over_transgendered_friend/,"Hello, /r/asktransgender. I have a long-time friend who came out (proper terminology?) a little over a year ago. She is Male to Female, and has transformed physically into what she always felt she was over the course of the last year. She has not yet decided if she intends to have any sort of surgery. As of now, the physical transformation is a result of hormonal treatments (as well as finally being able to let her hair grow out, to wear make-up if she so chooses, dressing the way she feels comfortable, etc.). Her name has been legally changed, and she seems on the way, finally, to thoroughly-deserved happiness... some of the time. 

My question(s) is mainly about depression and emotional volatility in transgendered persons who are taking hormones. I understood that the hormonal treatments are vital and that she can't stop taking them - not now, and probably not ever. She nose-dives into frightening depression at very slight provocation, grows intensely angry with no apparent cause, careens back and forth between near-mania and depression on a regular basis. The slightest things bring her to tears. Or to rage. 

I'm concerned I don't know how to deal with these effects in a way that is of any help. We've been friends forever. I don't feel like I am fullfilling my part of of the relationship if I can't understand what she's going through well enough to provide the kind of support she wants or needs. All I have to compare it to are the few friends I've had who have had children - the hormonal levels toward the end of their pregnancies and their behavior as a result has been similar. But in the case of the prego-friends, there's always the ""this is temporary, don't worry about it, just let her talk"" factor. My trans friend doesn't have the luxury of it being temporary. I'm concerned about the depression, to say the least, but the anger is pushing even her new trans acquaintances away. She needs them. They understand EXACTLY what she's going through, and I don't. Who do you talk to when there's no one who can relate willing to listen? You don't. You just feel isolated and get even more depressed. 

She has a very religious family who have disowned her for deciding it was time to openly be the gender she's always been. Many of our acquaintances are either purposely insulting when she's around or just straight up called it quits on the friendship, because she's not our friend, she's ""decided he's somebody else now."" The whole thing is heartbreaking. I've heard ""You don't just decide one day to be a woman and expect everyone to be cool with it"" more times from our friends than I can count on both hands. Because somebody would totally just wake up one day and decide on a whim to be potentially disowned by their religious family and outcast by their uncomfortable friends, right? Nobody seems to grasp that she isn't making a choice. Coming out was a decision. Being female gendered never was.

The point I'm trying to illustrate is that I see her becoming very isolated, due to a combination of hormonal outbursts and depression and others not knowing what to do about it, as well as the overall idiocy of her family and many of our mutual friends. I really don't want to be in either category.

I have asked her if I can help, even if just by distraction (you know, organizing things for us to do - movie night, spa night, things to take her mind off the struggle and just be herself for awhile), but the answers are very ambiguous. I think she feels more strange around me, having been a long-term friend from before the coming out, than I do around her (which is understandable. Personally, I might feel in her situation like anyone I knew before would never be able to see me as I am now without finding it weird in comparison. I don't find it weird, but that's not the point. Look at how everyone else is responding.). 

I'm looking for ideas from people who understand what she is experiencing. 

* Should I encourage therapy? Would that seem like an attack? 

* What can someone do to soothe pain like what she's experiencing in someone they care about when they can't truly relate to it? Any tips on hormonal depression/mood swings? 

* Should I just leave her alone? Every feeling revolts against that, it feels like abandoning her, but if it's better for her, I will give her her space. Maybe she wants to cut the tie with me to make friends she has only known post-coming out, so she doesn't have to have that niggling feeling I'm still thinking of her as the way she used to look. Should I ask? Is that a possibility and she just feels too guilty about it to tell me? She has enough on her plate already. I don't want to be a problem.

I want to be as sensitive as I can. I love the gal dearly. We've been friends forever.

1313424165.0,24,self.asktransgender,jjgf3,Some questions from a curious cisgendered straight white male,MyHiddenAccount,26,2,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/jjgf3/some_questions_from_a_curious_cisgendered/,"First, my background.  As I said, I'm cisgendered, straight, white, and male.  I throw that out there to make it clear I have NO idea what it's like to be confused about your sexuality or gender or to be discriminated against in anyway.  I consider myself open minded, but I freely admit that society has burdened me with some degree of homophobia and transphobia that I am slowly but surely working to overcome.  I don't have any transgendered friends (that I know of), so I don't really have anyone to talk to about things like this in person, so I was hoping I could pick your brains, if you all don't mind.

Let me begin by saying that I support gay and transgender rights.  I don't quite understand the desire to change your sex, but I think you should be allowed to marry whom you choose and be recognized as whatever gender you identify as.  I don't have any problem with the idea of a transman using the mens room or being my roommate or anything like that.  I know I still deal with a bit of transphobia because I would be uncomfortable dating a transwoman, but I understand that that is MY problem and no one else's.  As much as I hate it, I think it's proof that I do still have some fear of what I don't understand as well as fear of what other people think of me.

Now (finally) for my questions.  I think I understand what it means to be gay.  I am attracted to women, but if I were attracted to men, I can kind of imagine how much it would suck to be told I was wrong or evil, and as a married man I know I'd be pissed and heartbroken if I was told I couldn't marry the person that I love.  However, I don't quite understand what it mean to ""identify as female"" or male for that matter.  I understand the difference between sex and gender, but if gender is a spectrum, then why is changing your physical sex important or attractive to some people?  Why can't you just be a feminine man or a masculine woman?  Dress as the gender you wish to be seen as, change your name to something you feel suits you better, find a relationship in which you can fill the gender role you're most happy with, these things I get, but to me having surgery to change your sex feels almost like giving in to societal pressure.  Why can't you live your life female in gender but male in sex?  I've heard that the disconnect between gender and sex is very hard on transgendered people, but is this really an intrinsic problem or a problem caused by putting too much stock in what society thinks?  If society were completely accepting of people who were physically one sex, but were happier as the opposite gender, would fewer transgendered people feel the need to have surgery to change their sex?  I guess I don't quite see how a transgendered person hating their body is different from a cisgendered woman (or man for that matter) with body image issues.  If you say it's different, I believe you, I just don't understand it.

I don't mean to offend anyone, and I certainly don't mean to question your choices.  If a transgendered person is happier after changing their sex, that's good enough for me, I just made this thread to try to understand the motive better.  I probably didn't do a good job of expressing my questions, but feel free to ask for clarifications or to ask questions about me and my background if you think it would help you understand better, or feel free to tell me to fuck off if I'm out of line for asking in the first place.



**tl;dr

I don't understand why transgendered people feel drastic surgery is necessary or why it's a problem to have your gender not match your sex.  It strikes me as a response to societal pressures more than a solution to an internal problem.  Being straight and cisgendered though, I understand that I have no idea what I'm talking about, and I'm just trying to learn more.**

Well, she was always nagging on my case about this and that, hard core.  And I could tell she was projecting it because of my trans issues.  Saying ""oh, I should never have let you move in here, etc etc.""  Brought my girlfriend to the brink of tears a couple times, myself on one occasion.  She was having chest pain issues that started a bit before I moved in and told me she thinks that it all started when I moved in.  Needless to say I wasn't happy.  She even got on Klonapins because of the stress.

So a couple days ago, we went over to my parents house for a cookout.  I was expecting the normal stressed out mom.  Surprisingly, she seemed calm.  Like something has changed completely in her.  We talked about different things.  Like my trans issues, god, life in general.  And she was completely accepting. 

Well, she told me something that made everything fit together.  She has a friend who has been her co worker for 15 years.  Mom owns a beauty salon and her friend works with her.  Turns out, he friend is a total bigot when it comes to gay and trans issues.  She told her several times ""I don't know how you can have him over there knowing that he is dressing how he is, I would have disowned him.""  On several occasions she had mentioned that if any of her kids were gay, she would have none of that.  After a hurtful text from me a few weeks ago, I guess my mom came to a realization.  I was right and he friend was all the problem.  So a few days after that, she told her friend that, ""if we are going to remain friends, we can't work together.  You should find a new place to cut hair.""  Ever since then, mom has been the calmest I've seen her since even before I came out.  We actually started to bond again.

So in a couple words:  ""Go Mom!""

Whenever I express interest in joining them in something, I never get invited because they generally only hang out as guys.

With girls, I feel like I get left out because I'm gay. This is twofold in that with straight girls, they feel a bit uncomfortable around me, but with gay girls, because I'm not butch or alternative or goth or whatever, I don't fit in either. 

Finally, what I think exacerbates the whole thing is that because I have a girlfriend rather than a boyfriend, she's my best friend and we do a lot together as we share interests, so I've been less motivated in the past to cultivate relationships with other people.

Did I choose the right surgeon? Will I ever be sexually satisfied? I've never orgasmed with another person, even when I attempted penetration (lol) I couldn't get hard even pre-HRT. I feel like my dick was always a mental hurdle I couldn't overcome with another person.

*Fortunately for me, I have a tiny appetite that has left me 5'11"" and 127lbs (and I've even got no muscles to boot, heh), giving me some form of curves. Is there any general advice for accentuating a feminine physique?

*Much to my chagrin, I'm really hairy. I have hair all over my body. What should I do to remove it? Right now, I've just been using an electric razor for my face, would that be suitable for my body, arms and legs? Or is there something else that would leave less stubble/leave me with smoother legs/face?

*What kinds of make-up should I get? I have a general idea, but I'm not sure what to use to hide stubble or what would make me look best. Any suggestions?

*I already have some androgynous/more feminine clothing, but what would be the best way to replicate breasts? Again, I'm 5'11"" and 127lbs, so what would the most comfortable cup size be for me?

In advance, I'd just like to make it clear that I'm not a transvestite, and that I'm actually hoping to present as a girl because I believe I identify as a girl. I don't mean to sound ignorant or offensive, I'm not trolling, I'm just really new to this (I've had the feelings for years, but just now am I deciding to act upon them. Never too late, right?) and I'm sure several of you were too, so I just want a bit of help. Any links or articles too would be smashing.

I feel like I am in an losing situation with myself. I've been out to my parents for over a year by now, but I have made no progress in actually changing my appearance and how I act.

I'm in Norway, and the laws here for being allowed to transition are both slow and unforgiving. They expect me to be in a top psychological state and to present as my gender for *at least* a year before I'm allowed to start HRT, but that is only if I pass their diagnostic criteria.

The diagnosis is going tortuously slow. I'm meeting up with one of their psychologists on the 9th and after that I'll probably have to wait *months* before I get another appointment. If I'm lucky enough to fit their criteria I may be appointed to an endocrinologist, if I don't fit them I will have wasted two years of my life and be forced to move to another country if I even want a chance.

I'm not even allowed to pay for my own hormones.

I'm not comfortable in my body, nor presenting as a male. This has lead to me locking myself up inside my apartment for months at a time. I'm in this frustrating limbo of not having enough friends to go to, and not being able to make new friends because I can't introduce myself to them as female.

The few times I've been outside I've really wanted to go into the clothing stores, make up stores, and salons to try to start off my transition, but I feel really uncomfortable in going there alone. That, and because I've been hiding from people for so long I look like a total oaf. I don't want to make the store look bad by going in there either and ruin the atmosphere.

I'm not a person who was sure of my gender since childhood. I had not put much thought into it before I hit puberty. I remember feeling happy once when a guy told me ""you look like a girl when your hair is wet"", and that I preferred to play out relationships between stuffed animals over war and cars, but that's about it. It's only in recent years where I've felt that testosterone is poisoning my body every hour and I've really desired to change.

Hell, I can't even cry comfortably. Whenever I do and hear my voice I have to stifle it and try to do it as silently as possible. I've got a very deep voice and it bothers me a lot, but I'm scared to practice my voice as to not bother my housemates.

My sister told me ""If you go through with this you're gonna be the ugliest girl ever."" I wouldn't expect to hear this from a 28 year old, and it really messed me up.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't suicidal. I just really want a way out, or something solid that I can hold onto. I want a friend that wants to help me rather than criticize me. Even some scientifically backed papers would help me just a little.

I just got off the phone with what will be my local GIC, The Porterbrook in Sheffield, after my referral (I live in both Sheffield: for Uni - and London: out of term) and in the conversation they let slip that the waiting list to be seen is, as the title suggests ""up to a 23 month wait."" 

I only got off the phone about 10 minutes ago, but since then I've been feeling nauseous, sick and just downright upset.

I've always been of the opinion that I would go through it the standardised way that the NHS give because it would be the safest route - I would get regular blood tests, I would get support from the GIC on voice training (I have an annoyingly deep voice) etc. but this revelation has actually made me consider DIYing it for the first time in a serious manner. Whilst I've always been against it, and my sense of reasons says to not do so, I feel like if I had to wait that damn long just to get seen I'd go mad. 

I don't really know what the purpose of this post is, but I guess I'll try to phrase a question out of it:

Did any of you on here who have at least started to transition via the NHS get told something similar to this waiting period, and if so did it actually play out that way, or did the actual wait time pale in comparison to the ghastly figure of nearly 2 years?

I am a 24 your old male, and I live in Utah.  I grew up mormon, my family is mormon, and everyone I know is mormon.

I have had thoughts of being female and have even envied girls for awhile now.  I am not sure what has cause my dysphoria, but I believe it started during the 8th grade.  Sometimes I could go months without a single thought, but then I'd have a dream where I was a girl and it would ruin the entire day and I would feel depressed for weeks.

I don't have a history of cross dressing, but not due to lack of desire.  I have no sisters or close cousins, nor do I have ANY privacy in which I could hide my own stash.  I have not had a girlfriend either.  So access to feminine clothing is non existent. 

I have recently began seeing a therapist to talk about my dysphoria.  It was really hard to even tell him.  I have been denying it for years, and as a result I am emotionally null.  After telling him though, it was like breaking open a dam.  I began to feel everything at once, and it hurt. It still hurts.  I felt really good to have told someone though.

I have thought about HRT, and I want it.  A lot of the time though I doubt myself, that maybe I'm just overreacting or just going through a phase, but I don't want to go back to denial and I know that later I'll come back to where I am again.

The reason I am posting is that I am scared, really scared, and looking for a little cheering.  I live in a mormon community and I doubt I get little if any support.  I love my parents and my younger brother (don't ask me about my older brothers).  But I fear what their reaction will be when I come out.

I will graciously accept any virtual hugs!

And are there any support groups in Utah?

Are there any other mormons that have transitioned and did you receive any support from your family?

So here goes, advice would be received gratefully.

Recently, an ex-spouse of a friend of mine transitioned mtf. In conversations with my friend in talking over the actions of her ex-spouse, which are currently a necessary topic of conversation, we have accordingly switched gender pronouns and consistently use ""she"" and ""her"" when speaking about the ex-spouse, ever since she transitioned, as is only right. But we knew her long before she decided to transition, and are unsure how to talk about her actions, when they need to be discussed, that happened well before she transitioned. 

I know that the best answer would be to ask her what she would like, and if I can do that without causing problems, I will. But, like I said, she is an ex-spouse of a friend of mine, and there are some hard feelings all around regarding past actions (none of which, thankfully, have anything to do with her transitioning.) Having said that, it is very important to us that we support her right to  self-identify. My friend, her ex, has said that she uses female pronouns when speaking of her any time after she decided to transition, but male pronouns for speaking of her experiences in their relationship prior to the transition.  We have followed her lead in this, but are now wondering whether that's really the right thing to do--does one maintain that pre/post distinction, or should one change pronouns when speaking in the third person about pre-transition too? We are trying to model the best language, so that's why I'm asking this very specific linguistic question, and whether there is a ""general practice"" or it's a ""you need to talk to her and ask"" kind of thing.  Thank you!

tldr; is it ""general practice"" to use the old assigned-gender pronoun when speaking in third person about someone's pre-transition actions/life, or do you maintain post-transition pronouns even when talking about pre-transition life?

My fourteenth birthday was occupied with deepest misery, and I swore on that day that by my fifteenth, I'd be living as a girl despite the intensity of the adversity I faced in achieving such: and succeeded I have, more than one hundred percent; of this, I am very proud. (:

I owe some thanks to the members of this community: I arrived here in July of last year in desperation. Being around here for a short time was sufficient to push me to dispel my fears and move forward with transition; I am very grateful to have been emboldened as I was, because it was that which led me to attaining hormones before male puberty could do any damage worthy of note.

Academically, my performance has largely recovered from the melancholy through which I suffered last year. I passed a placement examination and qualify for dual-enrollment in the local community college henceforth. I have intention to take a college algebra course over the summer, followed by an SAT next year (mostly because a diagnostic suggests that I'm eligible for [Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth](http://cty.jhu.edu), and I'd like to make that official in hopes of attending next summer).

As far as the other aspects of school go, well, I'll admit that I dislike public high school. q: Introversion is just as much a component of my personality as it always has been, but my shyness and notably my agoraphobia have waned in their severity. Nobody, save for a single gay student to whom I impulsively divulged my status, of the student body is aware that I am trans: all are under the impression I'm a cis girl. This is not to say I'm not a member of the LGBTQPA community: I may not readily reveal my association with the T, but I freely identify with the P, and as everyone thinks me to be some extraordinary genius, nobody is surprised by my atypical insight into gender.

I had a somewhat brief relationship with a guy who was not disconcerted by my configuration, but I'll not share many details of that: suffice it to say I proved not to be a very romantic person and he dissolved the relationship. I've mulled over the possibility that I am aromantic, and have concluded that only time will ascertain that. In any event, I've no intention of pursuing another relationship.

Inasmuch as personal issues are concerned, my living situation remains just as unstable: my grandparents, understandably, would prefer to dissolve their relations with me, and it is probable that they will seek to restore custody of me to the state within three years; it's something that causes me some anxiety since I cannot really know much of what will follow (besides the ambiguity of the inevitable foster care since I've no one else with whom to reside considering that the entire remainder of my family has disowned me or lost custody), and therefore cannot prepare myself for it, but as I cannot prepare, I try not to permit it to linger on my mind. Rationally, I comprehend their wishes: I'm a particularly exceptional individual (and I should note that although *exceptional* bears a positive connotation, I am using it in both negative and positive lights), and as they are not guilty of having begotten me or even having encouraged my mother to birth me (indeed, to the contrary, they suggested abortion at that time), it is only natural that they should wish to be relieved of the burden I am.

Regarding health issues, with gender dysphoria representing a smaller value in the overall equation, several other concerns of my mental health have been exposed. I'll not yet divulge details of these, as they're yet unclear, but they do serve to satiate many questions which were otherwise unanswered.

I suppose that'll suffice for this post. Feel most free to make further inquiries, and I'll deliberate on whether to respond. (:",,False,,t5_2r4b9,False,,,True,t3_1aeiwm,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1aeiwm/the_taste_of_success/,

A few minutes after I joined someone asked for help with something that I was able to help them with, so I said (or tried to say) that I'd help them out - I was immediately interrupted by people telling me that I sound like Michael Jackson..

I should have quit the channel then and there because I already felt like crying but I did a little bit of practicing to ""fix"" my voice since it was maybe a little rusty, waited a bit and changed my channel nickname and tried again. This time I got ""Is that a girl?"" ""No, it's some guy using voice changing software."" I told them that I was indeed a girl and they kept arguing with me saying that ""Girl's don't sound like that."" I shut up again for a bit, even closer to crying. Again I should have quit but I was determined to not let it get to me and to convince them that I was indeed female.

So someone asks for help and this time I was adamant in helping them and I wasn't going to let the people who kept saying shit get to me. He asks for help and I tell him I will, and immediately after someone in the chat responds with ""You're not a woman."" That was like the last straw.. I helped the guy out and then left the channel, cried a little bit and then laid down.

I don't get it, everyone says I sound female in person, people on reddit and even the ever-so-critical /cd/ board say the same. People tell me they're jealous of how female I sound and yet I get this bullshit when I actually ""go out in the field"" and use it. I can't help but think people are just being nice to me or simply don't know how to critique voices properly or something.

Needless to say my confidence in my voice is crushed right now and I'm going to do a lot more practicing until I start talking to people online again. Specifically I want to raise my pitch and drastically feminize my speech pattern because I don't speak femininely enough.

I don't have any questions or anything, but I guess I am open to advice. I've already had the whole ""don't let what they said get to you"" spiel told to me by two different people and don't need to hear it again.

I'm comfortable being seen by others as a woman. Indeed, I NEED others to see me and know me as such... because leaving ""her"" out of my daily presentation is a huge omission and it feels like I am keeping up pretenses without her.

I'm out to family, friends, and have a great deal of real-world experience. I know several of the ""celebs"" and have read just about every book/website/blog on the subject. Acceptance is decent and my life is stable and reasonably happy.

But I'm not a woman... even though I sit in my car with the windows rolled up exclaiming ""I AM A WOMAN!"" over and over to comfort myself on the difficult days.

Seems like the groundwork is all there. I'm getting the last of my beard removed w/electro, finishing off the last appendages with laser hair removal, getting FFS consults, and checking in occasionally with a good gender therapist. HRT progression videos on Youtube fill me with joy, hoping to heaven I will at least do as well. Yes, I've been here before, and here I am again.

Yet despite ALL OF THIS, I still hope I can somehow get off this roller coaster. I don't see transitioning as some sort of fun, exciting girl-party. Everything will be different... and not necessarily better EXCEPT for solving this on again/off again obsessive but totally necessary girl-expression/feeling of mine.

Talking and planning and reading and emailing and thinking and even lying under the electrologist's probe are all preferable to the ACTUAL event of transitioning... because all of those things are in third person. It keeps transition at arm's length as if it were some far-off event that is still under my control. But soon that control won't be mine anymore. Once I start HRT, people will form new opinions. My male privilege will erode. I will become ""different"". I could get fired. I could lose everything.

Why not distract myself a few more years until I kick off? Travel. New hobbies. Volunteerism. Take advantage of the male privilege I already have and max it out. Accept not everyone gets what they want in life and move on. Besides, I have only a pathetic amount of life experience compared to a cis woman. How will I ever catch up? Maybe I won't like it? Maybe I'll find myself constrained by unrealistic expectations on the other side, and feel similarly ""stuck""?

1361153956.0,24,self.asktransgender,18q4zq,Will I EVER figure out if I am a transsexual or not?,jpepe,31,7,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/18q4zq/will_i_ever_figure_out_if_i_am_a_transsexual_or/,"It's really eating at my soul trying to figure out if I am a transsexual or not. It's on my mind at some level for at least 40 hours a week. I've already been in therapy for 3 years to no avail (7 different therapists!) I've been on hormones now for 15 days and it's still unclear. Like I don't know if my heart what is right. I made a pros and cons.


Reasons I may be transgender:

-Literally my earliest memory is wearing my sister's clothes and loving it. I have been crossdressing ever since then.

-I started daydreaming about being a girl at age 5. It subsided for a little while, but then since the age of 13, I have sexually fantasized about being a girl every single day, multiple times a day for the past 8 years.

-Without going into details, but my first sexual experience was while wearing girl's clothes.

-female hormones make me feel excited.

-Imagining myself as a woman gives me the greatest pleasure that I've ever experienced in life.

-When I walk by female clothes in stores, I really long to be wearing them

-It gets to me not having a female body, clothes, or external appearance.

-I am engulfed by transgender culture. I subscribe to transgender blogs, I watch transgender video journals on youtube, I read transgender news websites, I'm member of transgender forums online. I am really fascinated by it.

-My whole sexual orientation seems defined by these crossgender feelings. I can only achieve arousel by imagining myself as the woman in the sexual role


Reasons I may not be transgender:

-I like being the alpha male

-When I talk to other transsexuals, I can't relate to their narratives.

-The things we want in fantasy might not necessarily be what we want in real life.

-Fantasizing about being a girl is more fun than the reality of it

-I could never love another man

-I like the male/female dynamic of a relationship (to be fair, I've never experience a lesbian relationship to know if I would enjoy it...)

-I can't imagine myself being a lesbian, it doesn't click with me at all. I feel like a straight guy.

-My girlfriend made me feel positive about being a guy

-When I was with my girlfriend, I never thought, ""man, I really wish I could be a woman in a lesbian relationship with her""

-I have zero female likes, interests, or hobbies.

-I don't know the first thing about being a woman.

-I don't identify with females or have female friends or want any female friends

-All of my role models and heroes are men.

-I am very masculine

-I would not want to alter my voice if I transitioned. My voice is part of my identity.

-I would say that I am attracted to women, but I've never really envisioned myself as a lesbian. I have never been attracted to lesbian pornography.

- I have a rebound effect - When I'm done fantasizing, the feelings subside temporarily.


Other factors:

-I am romantically, emotionally, and somewhat physically attracted to women, but I don't really get too sexually attracted to them. If I do, it's very weak compared to my crossgender sexual attraction. My so called ""crossgender sexual attraction"" involves me fantasizing about being a woman and sometimes having sex with men (because it makes me feel more like a female).

-I could never relate to the other guys in the locker room who would boast about ""banging girls."" I don't get normal sexual feelings towards girls. I've never thought, ""Man, I would love to have sexual intercourse with this girl.""

I work for a software company, and have been asked to make two pieces of screening software work together. One is a case management intake form for an emergency housing program, the other is screening software for public benefits like Medicaid.

The housing program's intake form has four Gender options: Male/Female/Transgender/Other. Yea, not perfect for a variety of reasons, but nice they're making the effort I guess.

The benefit screening software has only Male/Female, and won't add more. Whenever a housing intake form has a field the screening software uses (gender is a required field), but answer options the screening software doesn't have, I have to decide what to ""default"" to.

So yea... wtf do I do? If someone answers the Gender field as Trans or Other, how do I pick a standard ""default"" of either Male or Female? The Housing program will still have their full intake form, so for safety's sake if someone is trans hopefully they'll be directed towards a program that is familiar with trans people. But the ""default"" option I choose will be used to populate their Medicaid and Food Stamps applications.

Crap. The screening won't run without ""gender"" selected. Maybe default to Female, because then if they're pregnant the system will be able to process that information (and be considered for WIC eligibility &amp; etc)?

My parents will be kicking me out because I'm trans. I'm 23, but I've been financially dependent on my parents because I've had rotten luck finding a full-time job. 

I'm already preparing myself. Packing clothes, computer gear and electronics, books I want to keep, and valuables that I can possibly sell, including video games. I have a small money reserve as well that I can fall back on. 

I am fortunate to have a 2010 Toyota Corolla that's in great condition. I have a part-time job with enough income to make my car payments and pay for car insurance. However, I'm just short of making enough to afford rent for a place to live. I'm applying to as many jobs as I can, but jobs in South Carolina are rare right now.... 

I have an excellent trans/lgbt group supporting me, and a number of people offering me a place to stay at night. I'm also going to try to see my therapist this week if possible, and see how she can help me keep my head on. 

So, that's my basic situation. Is there anything else I should do? Anything I should know about? I guess two things I need to do is find car insurance when I'm knocked off my parent's plan, and I'll need a new, cheap cell phone plan....

So at 19 after meeting a Transman out in the wild, I realised that this might have been causing some of my self-esteem issues to do with my appearance and personality, specifically how I was supposed to be compared to how I was. 
/Backstory

I decided to jump straight into it, I went out with a friend and I picked out some basics from Primark and makeup from Boots and she kindly went to the counter for me so I could shy away from the judging glares of people a little longer. 

When you finally decide you want clothes that fit, and look good, you have to actually own up to what you're doing. At my University Hometown I went out and bought some clothes with a friend in TopShop and decided I needed to try them on to justify spending that much on clothes that were nice, and to do that I had to go into the changing rooms. 

It went so well. 


""I'm sorry, the male changing rooms are downstairs"" 


I was a little deer-in-headlights, so I only got out


""I'm trans*.""


-Beat-

 
""Oh! Go on then.""

I went and tried them on, they fit beautifully and I felt really happy with everything. Leaving the changing rooms I got asked how everything was, if I wanted any help, and even though at the till the cashier thought they were for my friend initially, it went amazingly. 


So, I had the confidence to go and do it in my hometown. Smaller than my University town, but I got the stuff I wanted, and went to the changing rooms. 

Blank faces. Ignored until I asked for someone specifically if I could try them on. Silence. The friend I'd come with was a metre behind me waiting outside. Eventually someone guided me to the disabled stall and let me try the clothes on. Leaving I had several.. longer blank looks. I felt stupid and small, seeing the person deliberately check the stall I'd used as I left. Obviously I wasn't taken as someone genuine, but just someone doing something weird and disgusting. I'm honestly tempted to buy all my clothes online from now on, just because of this, or wait till I've started HRT, if I want to go that far, before I can go into shops to look at clothes.

So, a while back, [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/s1dod/diy_selftesting_hormone_levels_are_saliva_tests/) recommended online-order hormone testing. Well we finally decided it was best and safest for Emily to start things fresh and get tests done to have reference levels to work with.

Long story short, she stopped everything (you'll recall us sending IM estrogen to those who asked a few weeks back) and let her system come back to stasis over about six weeks, to have as clear a baseline as possible. To say it was hard on her would be understatement, but we finally went out and got the tests ordered, taken, and now have the results back, so it's finally over with.

[Here are the results we got back.](http://imgur.com/a/tCyjv) What I'd like to know is, how exactly do we read this? I know from a few threads and posts that we should look at Free T (not on this test as far as I see), Total T, and Estradiol, and that normal female ranges are more or less as follows:

-Free T = 0.2 - 2.2 pg/ml

-Total T= 5 - 85 ng/dl

-Estradiol= 125 - 200 pg/ml (I've also heard 300-400 pg/ml as ""normal"" so I'm less sure here)

First, are those levels accurate or not? If so, would they be good target ranges to start off at, and if not then what should we aim for?

Second, is this test adequate to make judgement calls based on it? I understand that the ideal situation would be to have a real doctor look at it, but so far every endo we've visited basically told us to pack the fuck out when we asked about HRT, so it's not the simplest thing to do right now.

Lastly, and most importantly, what should we be looking at in this test? I understand that the last few lines are the most explicitly relevant, but the rest of them have to be important on some level too, right? For example, what is the importance of FSH and LH, and what should we look for in them?

I'm seriously at my wit's end here, and I have no idea what to do.  I'm a bit of a mess right now and I'm not really sure how to explain everything.  Nor am I sure if I'm asking for advice, help, stories, or what.  I have no idea.

I started my transition (MtF) about 8 or so years ago.  It was rough.  Family gave me the boot for a while, I was forced to drop out of school to work to support myself, and times were shitty.  I kept at it, wanting a better life for myself.  I jumped through all the hoops, got the resources I needed, and I eventually went through everything.  I passed with flying colors, and had my surgery about 4 or 5 years ago.

I was happy.  I was normal.  I was just another girl out in the world.  I was finally just living a normal life.  I went out, had fun, made friends, did stupid things, dated random guys, worked random jobs, took classes when I could afford it, etc.  And no one knew about my past.  No one.  I was finally just a normal girl.  My life wasn't perfect obviously, but for once I was only struggling with mundane problems; putting myself through school, getting the bills paid, balancing obligations and social life, etc.  I was normal.  All I had ever wanted.  It was so wonderful.  I was finally whole, and for the first time in my entire life, the world made sense.  There are no words to explain what it feels like to simply be complete.  

And now I'm losing it.  I don't know what's happening, but I'm losing it.  My looks are fading.  I get the weird stares.  I get the double-takes.  I get the strange looks that range from awkward/confusion to downright disgust.  I had a little kid at work last week straight up say to my face ""you're a boy.""  

It's been getting worse, and it's shattering my entire world.  I'm miserable.  I'm only 26.  I knew it wouldn't last forever, but I thought I'd have a few more years than this.  I can't go back to being an outsider.  I can't go back to being trans.  I can't do it.  Everything is falling apart.  Sometimes people just look at my like I'm a freak.  I can't handle it.

Was he sweet or creepy?,oldsapphire,37,12,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/14ygro/trannychased_during_my_1st_time_presenting_f_in/,"I'm not even 1 month on HRT, but I felt confident enough in my presentation (clothes, makeup) that I decided to give part-time a whirl. I didn't seem to draw any negative attention, and even got a few female pronouns. 

Then on the train... there were no seats so I had to stand. Not very glad about that because it would emphasize my height, but what could I do? A gentlemen across from me was staring like a drooling wolf... I knew he was checking me out (I had sunglasses on so I could watch him), but I didn't think he was going to make a move. He leans in during the ride and says to me ""You're a very beautiful young woman, do you work?"" 

!!!!! My first day out and I'm getting hit on??? I was in disbelief. 

""Thanks... and... yeah, I work.""

I was so effing nervous.

After that he retreated and I tried to just ignore him. Fortunately a seat opened up and I snatched it to avoid his direct stares. Well, *un*fortunately, the seat next to me freed up at the next stop, and he was quick to plop down.

""I wonder what was going through your mind when I said that to you,"" he says.

""...Well, I was thinking about my boyfriend,"" I lied. ""But thanks for the compliment, really you're very kind."" Gosh, I sound like an old maid.

Him: ""Oh, okay. Well, now I know what they mean by the term passable.""

I ... FROZE. He knew!! I didn't know what to say.

Him: ""Passable - I'm sure that's a term you've used before.""

I got smart-alecky: ""I think I've seen it in the dictionary before, flipping around...""

Him: ""Ohh okay, it's gonna be like that; okay.""

After that he starts to go into who he is, telling me about his job and showing me pictures of him with celebrities (he works in the film industry). I told him that I was a film major, and he gave me a tip on where I could intern and get work in the future.

""See, I've been honest about who *I* am,"" he points out.

Me: ""I'm sorry, I'm really shy.""

Him: ""Oh, bull shit.""

I was like wow... kind of a compliment - implying that I'm brave or something - but I *was* telling the truth... it's my first day out! He didn't know that. And I was sooo scared. I'm very shy, at least by *my* definition.

After some small talk, his stop comes up and he leaves me his email address. He tells me to email him and then leaves. 

Okay... so here's my guess. He's a sweet creep. I mean, he was willing to flirt with me in public - knowing I'm trans* - so he's obviously not worried about what others will think, either because I pass well enough or he just doesn't care one bit. He didn't say anything rude or insulting, and was in fact correct to imply that I wasn't being entirely honest. But I was scared!  I think anyone who tries to hit on people in public - especially *in transit* - is being slightly rude, don't you? I don't know. It seems like an invasion of privacy. I mean, I'm totally willing to accept that this sort of stuff happens to females in NYC but... it won't win him any sweet points from me. 

HoWeVeR... he *was* kind enough to give me advice for my career, and didn't pressure me to do anything unreasonable. Most of the discomfort I felt was self-inflicted nonsense, I'll admit that. 

Anyway, I wonder what others would do in this situation? Send him an email like he wanted? Maybe just to say thanks for the career tip (and see where that goes)? Or ignore him completely? I think he was maybe in his mid to late 30's or 40's. Attractive but all those creepster marks bring that down.

**TL;DR:** Tranny chaser clocks me on the train, hits on me, gives me solid career advice, then leaves me his email. Would you contact him, or ignore him?

Thanks for any responses... happy &amp; safe passing, y'all :)

**EDIT:** Wow... well, I guess the jury has spoken... This guy seems to have been trying to proposition me for sex, and upon realizing that that wasn't going to happen, he exposed my vulnerabilities to get whatever shred of myself may have still been available... Frustrating!! I will **not** be contacting him, and I so appreciate all the responses so far.

I am 19, by birth a male, and my gender dysphoria has been wreaking havoc on me lately. I am no longer questioning my identity, I am almost positive that I am a transsexual. I match the descriptions here and in the case-studies I have read to a tee. In brief, I have always desired being a girl, began cross-dressing secretly during puberty, and have nothing but an insatiable sexual desire to be a woman. I realize these are by no means the only qualifying factors, but they help summarize my experience. 

I am so scared of what this means that for days I have been sobbing and throwing up due to the mixture of shame, guilt and embarrassment that has been accumulating in my gut. I have been trying so hard for months to convince myself that I am a man, and that I can simply live my life with this as my secret. I now realize that my only chance at happiness is to begin to accept my sexual identity and sexuality, and to consider my options as a transgender person. Although the shame and stigma associated with transitioning are burdoning me heavily now, I cannot bare the thought of growing old as a man with a secret, and wondering what could have been. 

Right now I need the courage to come out to somebody and lift this weight from me. I am strongly considering coming out to my older brother. We are very close. I was thinking of showing him some cases and explaining my relations to them. Please help me decide what the best way to come out is.

This led to other things and at one point one of the girls mentioned she liked to buy ""guy scented"" candles (they smell like cologne and aftershave and whatnot) and burn them when she didn't see her BF for too long.  All the other girls agreed that they love the smell of their guy/his scent/cologne/shampoo/whatever.  I mentioned that I thought that was kinda odd (talking about the fact that it was a candle...not the liking men's scent around/smell of your guy on a pillow or sheet, etc.)  She responded with something along the lines of ""you wouldn't understand, you're a guy."" and for some reason it really upset me :(  Because I totally got it (I loved my pillow smelling like my ex after I got back from a weekend with him, the musky smell of mens cologne, etc.) but wasn't allowed to open up about it because it was a ""girl"" thing and I am a ""guy.""  It really bummed me out.  I feel like I'm left out of a lot of stuff because I'm a ""guy"" and get lumped in with them and then when I really want to empathize and open up about myself and stuff I can't because I'm a ""guy"" and am automatically excluded from women's discussions.

And the opposite is true as well - even when I'm subtly showing my ""feminine side"" by being supportive of female friends, talking about clothes and color matching and haircare and all other manner of women's topics, I get this guarded response, like it's weird that I know these things and can talk about them.  And always the subtle hint that ""you're not a girl, you wouldn't/shouldn't understand.""  Has anyone else experienced this?  Is this dysphoria?

From straight to gay, gay to straight, etc.

So, my question is how do you feel about that?

I'm asking because I find it very interesting how my view on that shift has changed over time.   When I first came out to myself as trans, one of the things that freaked me out most was that being trans would also mean I'm gay.   It was really, really scary to imagine that the **ideal situation** involved not just losing male privilege, but also going from a straight guy to a lesbian.   The fear of discrimination because of being trans was bad enough, but the added fear of discrimination because of eventually being gay was the cherry on top which for a while really made me feel like there was no decent solution.

But as I've begun my transition, I've found that(at least when in accepting circles) I really love that fact.   It's an anchor for me when I'm feeling down about myself, and there's a spark about being lesbian that was completely and utterly missing from being a straight male; probably because of the incredibly strict gender roles involved.   One of the biggest things I'm looking forward to is dating women as a woman, and finding and participating in an accepting lesbian community.   

I guess it just blows my mind what a complete 180 I've made on the way I feel about the change in my effective orientation, and I'm just wondering other people's thoughts about the topic themselves.",,False,,t5_2r4b9,False,,,True,t3_yw44j,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/yw44j/what_do_you_think_of_your_new_orientation/,

Let me apologize in advance if I say something wrong, I am here to ask and be educated, and please express your opinion!

I wish to ask how to be able to acknowledge the information of someone being transgender, without being simply stupid. This is the story:

After my coming out as a lesbian (mostly to myself, then to others) I have been immersed in all the sexuality/gender/equality/etc. information online (not limited to queer stuff).

I have learned a lot due to this wonderful thing called the internet, and reddit especially.

I have informed myself about transgender issues, and in my opinion these are the only things I would feel if anyone personally felt like they can be open with me and told me they are transgender:

respect

and

anger that such a thing has to be sort of pointed out/talked about at all

and

feeling grateful that a person would share with me a part of their most intimate story.

Now... I have recently jumped into a community with a lot of people that have very interesting stories, and during one night I have heard several people talk like this: ""Oh yeah XX, she said blabla, well ""she"", ifyouknowwhatImean-we-all-do."" It was really obvious. Word ""trans"" popped out here and there.

I understand this is a small community and that the people who were talking about the girl in question were probably close to her (at one point, or currently). But I was a stranger there, and they obviously outed her to me. This actually happened twice - one girl that they talked about I did not know, the second one I met during the night.

I did not feel the need to educate the group on how wrong this is or could be. Maybe these girls in question simply do not care, and do not mind such a thing. Who knows what kind of approach they have? I do not know them, and it would not be my place to argue about this. 

But I will talk to these girls probably more in future. And here I am, thinking of a hypothetical situation, where one of them personally would disclose to me their transgender experience. This could happen even if I did not know of this before (from their community gossip) - or with anyone else that I meet in my further life.

Often have I heard (online) how cis people react very badly to this. They (we?) say stupid things like ""I would have never known!"" and ""Well you look better than I expected!"" and really stuff that I get mad about when I think about it. You know what I mean.

And the only normal reaction that I could see, from my self, would be ""Well you have my respect, and I am glad you shared - and I feel angry at society as a whole that it is something that seems unusual in anyway.""

Please, tell me. Would this be insulting in any way?

I suck at translating my opinion into words when I cannot be funny - but this is NOT a funny thing for me! So I hope I have managed to say correctly what I wished to say.

""It's not a testosterone-ridden football camp, and it's not possible to go as a girl right now. You are very early in your counseling, so we don't know where things are going to go with that, but the current fact is you're a boy, not a girl.""

He eventually came back after 5-10 minutes of yelling. At the end they asked me to come inside, where they told me they want to do some neurology testing crap so that I ""know for sure what I'm doing"".

I feel like I'm being treated like a child. I've felt this way ever since I was 7; almost 13 years later I'm still not trusted. They know so much more than me apparently. 

So now my parents are arguing upstairs. What do? I had originally planned on starting HRT by last fall, but now it looks like its being delayed YET AGAIN.

A lot of the people in them were referred to as having been ""born a woman/man"", which is quite obviously (even to my on trans issues rather untrained eyes) both offensive and kind of stupid (noone is born a man or a woman, after all. Everyone is born a baby"". But it got me wondering whether saying ""X was born male/female"" is also considered offensive? I mean, on one hand male and female are supposed to designate sex in the strictly biological sense (as opposed to gender), but on the other hand it does get used in lots of other senses too and you do sometimes hear people talk about ""the female/male gender"" as opposed to the female or male sex.


Now, I know that the trans community is as diverse as any and those usually don't have one unanimous opinion on things, but just as a general: is it considered offensive to in, for instance, an article say that a transman was ""born female"" (or vice versa)? If so, what could you use instead for that type of construction? Similarly, since ""male"" and ""female"" can be used for a bit of both, would using a term that refers strictly to the biological sex of the person (if such a one exists in the language in question) in a construction like this be considered offensive?

Thanks in advance for your answers! I hope I haven't been unclear about what I'm wondering about.

I'm a trans girl and my boyfriend is a transguy. We've been going out for a while and we've trying to be intimate lately. 

Last night we got into that awkward back and forth where he was all, ""Just tell me what you want to do"" and I said the same thing, but neither of us knew what to say or ask, so that eventually I just turned to him and asked what he was comfortable with and if there was anything that made him dysphoric. Besides saying that he liked being ""on top"" he didn't really go into detail... he was clearly very nervous and worried that I was dysphoric too, so we just kept things slow and limited it to making out/playing with my breasts. 

After that, I told him that besides not wanting to penetrate anyone else I'm not really dysphoric, and that I'm pretty comfortable otherwise. He said he wasn't really sure about what he was comfortable with.

Ultimately though he said something that worried me, he seemed to be afraid that because we were both trans that it would end in ""catastrophe"" if we tried to do anything. I just want this to be something that makes him feel good and non-dysphoric, and I don't want it to threaten our relationship, but I don't really know much about sexuality issues with trans guys. My gut instinct is to just wait for him to think things through and just tell him I'll be ready when he is. But if there are any perspectives on this or resources I could look at to learn more, I'd be really grateful.

Here's my rant.,Tina_Rayne,25,1,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/ldypz/im_drunk_heres_my_rant/,"So I don't get drunk too often even though I just turned 21 a few months ago. HOWEVER!! This night a friend dragged me to the clubs, which I haven't been to in a few years. The club was awesome, I was already a little tipsy. 

At this point it is worth mentioning that I've been on weak hormones for the last 4 months and that I'm switching over to spiro and Estrofem when ever it decides to show up through the mail (InHouse Pharmacy). So my results so far, even though slightly noticeable, aren't where they could be if I was on the right stuff since the beginning (I still pass perfectly as a guy :(  ). I'm not out to anyone IRL btw. 

So here I am in the club and my friends are trying to get me to start dancing in the club and daring me to go ask some girls to dance. I just couldn't do it. Normally, it doesn't take any effort outside of myself to get me going even without alcohol, but I just couldn't. There were beautiful women everywhere. 

I just kept looking at all of the beautiful women in on the dance floor having a great time and just feeling the strongest sense of jealousy I've ever felt in my entire life. Now I'm pretty two faced when it comes to dysphoria, I can fake a smile pretty well in front of people and even fool myself into thinking I'm having a good time but I was struggling tonight. 

I would see random girls and think to myself:
""She doesn't have a big nose.""
""She never had to train her voice to be that feminine.""
""She's most likely not self conscious about her height.""
""She has a natural hourglass shape and probably works out less then me.""
""She can wear a dress that beautiful and everyone praises her taste in clothes.""
""She has probably never shaved her face in her entire life.""
""She's been called 'ma'am' and 'miss' her entire life.""

I just couldn't take it anymore. I left my friends and just went to the bar and watched ESPN highlights for the next few hours. For the first time ever, I hated every single girl in an entire building just because they were girls and I wasn't. 

**tl;dr: went to a club, too many beautiful women there. I hate them all and don't expect me to dance with them.**

You need to give yourself time for your identity to fully manifest; you probably know you don't fit into the gender binary, but give yourself time to settle down, the answers will come easier to an eased mind. A great piece of advice I received was that I should not try and research an answer so much as plumb the depths of my emotions to find where my heart really lies.

Your identity is your own; no one can tell you better who you are than yourself. This does not mean research is bad by any means, but the key point is that you should not exclusively deduce, rationalize, or otherwise logically create your gender identity.

They recently saw some show on ABC involving trans people. The show strongly portrayed the classic trans narrative - showing signs really young, crossdressing while a kid, etc. They profiled three people. Two showed very early signs, later transitioned, and did well. The third showed no early signs, had a messy divorce in his late 30s, decided he was trans, transitioned m2f, and later regretted it.

The lesson the show seemed to portray was, ""if you weren't flaming obvious while you were in elementary, then you're not really trans and will regret it later.""

Here's my general timeline:

Pre-Puberty: Not into very masculine or very feminine activities. I can remember certain incidents, but it's impossible to say whether I'm just cherry-picking particular moments. I remember wanting to play hop-scotch on the playground. I remember being fascinated with my mom's makeup. I remember seeing some Discovery Channel show about transgender people, watching it late at night after everyone went to bed, and being captivated by it. I remember while joking around with my friends or brothers, sticking balls in my shirt and going, ""hey I got boobs herp!"" 

Middle and High School: didn't date until college. Grew increasingly drawn to trangender/transformation media. If there was a movie, television show, or video game involving people switching bodies, somehow magically or technologically changing into girls, I would find a copy and watch it. My secret guilty pleasure was Ranma 1/2.

In college: periodically questioned by gender, but would always suppress it, not wanting to be trans. I started dating, had a few girlfriends, but was never terribly confident about myself. (The only way I could ever get off with a girl was imagining I was her.) My interest in all things TG kept growing stronger, and I explained it away as some fetish or intellectual curiosity. I read all about hormone treatment, SRS, etc, all sorts of stuff. You never knew a cis guy who knew so much about trans stuff.

I even tried dating trans people, thinking, ""I must be a chaser."" I found this easier to accept than admitting I might be trans myself. The few trans women I dated, I didn't mind. They were nice enough. But I never experienced any kind of unique sexual excitement. It was no different than dating a cisgendered woman, which puts a big hole in the ""fetish"" theory. I was always more interested in post-op than pre-op women, and I never watched trans porn (or much of any porn for that matter.) I've realized I was more attracted to the idea of trans women and trying to live vicariously through someone else.

Finally, after college, I was done with school, supporting myself, and I could actually allow myself to think. I finally came out to myself last February or so, at age 23. Once I stopped repressing my feelings, my dysphoria became incredibly strong. I could barely look in the mirror. I started comparing myself to every woman I met on the street. It was crazy.

I finally sought out a gender therapist, started counseling, and I started transition in late April. No regrets yet and I like every bit of increasing femininity I see.

The problem for my parents is they saw none of this. I never tried on my mothers heals. I never came to them when I was five and told them I was a girl. I can remember some stuff from early childhood, but I can't be sure I'm not just cherry picking certain incidents. 

So, I ask y'all, how many of you showed stereotypical early signs, and how many didn't? Is there any hard data on this? Any references, testimonies, etc I can show my parents to help dispel this idea that everyone knows when they're really young?

I see so many people post here who are struggling with all of the roadblocks, uncertainties and hardships that come with discovering their transgender identities.  So I wanted to share a little happy story, one of those ""transitioning isn't always awful"" sort of things.  I'd like to think it will help somebody, but even if it doesn't, I still want to share it because I'm still glowy about it.

Yesterday was my first appointment with a doctor about starting hormone therapy.  I'm a 28 year old MTF who has wanted to take this step for years but was filled with too much apprehension about it.  I finally decided that, no matter my conception of the universe and the nature of existence, this is the only life that I can be totally sure I'll get to have.  I want to live it, as the real me.

So I went.

And it was a wonderful, wonderful experience.  I went to a community health clinic, specializing in GLBT services (this is in the heart of Texas, by the way, before anybody gets jealous).  I met with a doctor who specializes in HRT.  The office staff asked what name I would like to be called, so the entire time everyone called me by my REAL name, not the one I was born with.  My doctor talked to me for 10-15 minutes, decided I really was serious, and got out the prescription pad.

I now have bottles of sprio and premarin on my counter, both with my real name on the bottle, instead of my birth name.  

After 28 years, it feels like life can finally start.  It happened for me, and with patience and perseverance, it can happen for just about anyone.

Sure, I still don't have any idea how this will ultimately impact my career.  But I'm too happy to even worry about it right now.

Pacific Northwest includes Washington state (Seattle, Bellevue, Spokane, Olympia, Tacoma, otherVancouver, etc.); Oregon (Portland, The Dalles, Eugene, Coos Bay, etc.); northern California (north of Marin County); and even Alaska.  Thanks in advance for participating.

**EDIT 2**: So far, I'm noticing here mostly clinics, and this is a good start.  Unfortunately, this makes only sparse mention of specific physicians or nurse practitioners anywhere.  I'd like to get those out and available here — of these, please specify whether they do not see either trans women *or* trans men; whether you're aware they're accepting new patients or not; and please denote any other stipulations they have indicated that compels them to decline a new patient (e.g., weight, intersex gonads, reluctance to keep discreet on patient file about the patient being trans, and so on.).  Thanks.

1309050089.0,23,self.asktransgender,i98wh,"It's funny how we're expected, especially by family, to care what others think, as though we're that vain and desperate to actually need to impress others in order to gain their acceptance.",,32,9,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/i98wh/its_funny_how_were_expected_especially_by_family/,"Truth be known, we don't _need_ acceptance. While it is a nice luxury, what we _need_ isn't to be who others think we should be, but to be who we really are.

In the end, the only person we need to care about what they think of us is ourselves.

Being trans is kinda cool like that. By meer shear fact that we cannot internalize who we are, we deflect away many of those who would be unkind to us, taunt us, think ill of us, etc. We don't need to put up with them being in our lives, because they already have such a strong sense of not liking us that they steer well clear of us; they make themselves out as totally obvious. Other people should only wish they could be so lucky.

That doesn't mean that life is going to be any easier. That doesn't mean that there isn't a certain amount of ""bonus"" one gets for being ""a part of the pack"" (one of us, one of us, gooble gobble gooble gobble), but how much is that ""bonus"" worth when you are somebody like us and would need to trade in the meer essence of who we are, the ability to be our true selves, etc. for such a thing? For people like us, there is nothing more valuable in our lives than getting to finally be who we truly are; to have the outsides match the insides.

We shouldn't be so superficial that we need to care about what others think of us. If we did, we would spend copious amounts of time trying to win a rat race that has no end. We would spend a lifetime in constant strife and battle. We would need to trade in everything we are, and for what? For a lie? To be honest, I rather die than sit here worrying about what others think of me.

And to be honest, I've found in my life that the more I am just myself, the more others take notice. The more respect I get from others. The more others tend to say ""gee, look at that person have so much courage."" Being yourself is the one thing, especially growing up, that a lot of us were so afraid to do, and, to no real surprise, everybody else was too. Being a part of the pack meant everything: safety, respect, power. And a lot of people eventually matured to understand how petty it all was. How fake it was. How **bullshit** it all was. It got better because we all eventually challenged the lie that everybody should be alike, the status quo, the great gender barrier. We are the courageous ones, I assure you.

In the end, the people who are worried about the world being unaccepting are the ones who are themselves unaccepting, and the ones we shouldn't place our trust into. They are the ones who don't need to be in our lives because they add nothing to it. Get rid of them!

I surround myself with accepting people, and constantly I am amazed at the kindness of others. If transition has taught me two things, it would be that it is never selfish to be yourself, and not to underestimate the kindness of others. When we learn to accept the world around us, we find how accepting the world can really be.

And that doesn't mean there aren't those out there who will seek demise of others for being different than the pack. That doesn't mean there aren't those out there who will speak, think, and write ill of us. Doesn't mean one shouldn't ever let their guard down. Protect yourself, and use your good judgement. It saddens us all to see someone like us get hurt for just being who we are.

There is a long ways to go, but, in the end, the history books will write us as the ones with the courage and bravery that changed the world. The ones who were right and true, not bigoted and fearful. Take solace in this fact, and keep your bravery as strong as possible, educate others as much as you can, and don't let fear rule your life so that the next generation of transfolk can have it just a bit easier than we did.

So, do not bow down to others' petty opinions of yourselves.

1302218546.0,23,self.asktransgender,gl4d0,What not to say to trans people and why. ,ArcCollie,32,9,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/gl4d0/what_not_to_say_to_trans_people_and_why/,"I am one of two transgendered people on my college's campus, and both of us are freshmen. Because of this, our GSA is very unfamiliar with having trans-folk around, so I wrote this out to try and stop a lot of the questions I get asked all the time. I thought I'd share with /r/asktg in case anyone wanted to make comments or add to it. :] 

Note starts here:

“Have you had ‘the operation/surgery’”?
If you have to ask, you're probably not going to see what's in my pants regardless, so it really doesn't affect you. My genitals don't make me any more or less of a girl. They'll never matter any time in our acquaintance, I can assure you, so you really shouldn't be too worried about them regardless.
 
""If you did X, you'd be more masculine/feminine"" or, ""You'd pass better if you did Y.""
I can almost assure you that a trans person is very aware of most of their gender cues. I am aware of what traits of mine make me look masculine. You don't need to point them out for me. This also highly emphasizes that certain genders must look or act certain ways - every girl doesn't have big boobs, every guy doesn't have facial hair, cis or trans. I'm sure you wouldn't feel too great if we pointed out everything wrong with you. 
 
""When did you decide to be trans?""
I didn't. Next.
 
""You still look like a [biological sex] to me."" 
Most trans people would prefer not to be reminded of their previous incarnation, if you will. While those who say this generally mean no harm and are just being sentimental about a “person” they miss from their past, those who have transitioned usually don’t share the same sentimentality about their pre-transition self, so no matter what you see, it’s best to keep it to yourself.
 
“How do you have sex?” or ""So, you're MtF because you want to have sex with men, right?"" (or vice versa)
Sex is much more than penis-into-vagina. Gender and sexual orientation are two vastly different and unrelated things. Not all cisgendered girls like boys, and not all cisgendered boys like girls. The same applies to trans people. I have sex the same way any other person would.
 
The word tranny.
This is essentially equivalent to calling a gay person a fag. It labels us as something that is ""not a normal person, but a tranny,"" which feels pretty shitty. I know a lot of people, especially in the gay community, like to throw this around thinking its cute, but it's really not. Some trans people are okay with it, (I am as long as its a close friend saying it, among friends,) but you should always make sure before throwing it around carelessly.
 
""I knew you as a [biological sex/previous name/etc.], so I'm still going to call you that. Is that okay?"" or ""You'll always be a [bio sex] to me.""
Absolutely not. Don't get me wrong, I completely understand that for someone who knew me as a boy for so long that it can be hard to change, I definitely do. But I ask for the basic respect that you at least TRY to change. Saying this is basically saying ""Oh, I don't really agree with you, so instead of trying to accept a different mindset, I'm just going to ignore it."" I can assure you that nowadays you'll get some really weird looks calling someone with boobs a 'he'.  It's very discouraging to be constantly reminded of that old false identity that I'm trying so desperately to escape.
 
""Is/Are your dick/boobs/etc. real?""
I really can't believe how many times I've heard this question, (especially from complete strangers, oddly enough,) but the number is astounding. This is sorta the same thing as the genital surgery - unless I'm planning on sleeping with you, (and protip, I'm probably not,) then it doesn't matter. I absolutely hate this question because people don't really seem to think it through - just because I'm trans doesn't mean you have a right to know personal details about me. You wouldn't ask a cisgendered girl if her boobs were implants or not, right? Then don't ask me.
 
""What was your old name before you transitioned?"" or ""What's your real name?""
This is probably the biggest offender on the list, and I've heard this more times than I can count, even from AGSA people. Demanding someone's old name invalidates their identity, to put it simply. It's telling them, ""Oh, well, this new name isn't really new, what's your real name?"" It's -extremely- disheartening to have someone press this, since it reminds us of something we are trying desperately to divorce ourselves from. Most people find the old names inaccurate, as though they never properly represented them anyway, (I know I do,) so there's really no point in anyone knowing. If I'm comfortable with you knowing it, then you probably already do.
 
Also,
DON'T OUT A TRANS PERSON WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT.
I don't like being known as trans. I'd prefer to be known as female, but I know I'm still in transition so the odds of that happening are doubtful at best. But that being said, when we ARE passing, don't introduce us as ""My trans friend"" or things like that unless we bring it up first. Like the name thing, this really strips away a part of our identities, and is very dehumanizing in the sense that it says we're not seen as our true gender, but instead as ""a trans person.""  We'd rather be known as our true gender.

About a year ago, my dad came out to me (her daughter) as transgender.  I call her mom now, but she was dad at the time.  Anyway, she's been taking it slow.  She is on full hormones now and starting to develop more female characteristics like breasts, wider hips, etc.  She's just starting to go out in public in female clothing, but for the most part, our friends/relatives don't know.  However, eventually this is going to be an unavoidable topic, and I'm going to need to talk to my schoolmates about it.

I go to a catholic school in a fairly religious area.  Most people here are religious and go to catholic schools.  My classmates are pretty anti-LGBT.  Once we saw a lesbian wedding on a bus ride, and everybody was like, 'Ew, gross, they shouldn't do that with little kids around.' (There were small children attending the wedding.)  I would hate to see what they would say about a trans* person.  I have one friend who is pretty open minded, mostly because she comes from a HUGE family and has transgender cousins she hangs out with.  I know she would stand up for my mom if anybody made fun of her.  They were once browsing Facebook and saw something on somebody's profile that said something like 'the struggles of being a boy in a girl's body' and they said he was 'crazy' and asked 'what does that even mean, if you have a girl's body you are a girl'.  That is the only time trans* issues have even come up.  

On the religion aspect: Since it is a religious school, they are all very religious.  I'm not very religious, and to be honest, I'm kind of burnt on religion now.  My mom had so many troubles growing up, believing she had evil thoughts or God would hate her.  My friends all think I am deeply religious (except for the one I mentioned earlier) and would be shocked if I said otherwise.  I am not going to confirm later and that will be an issue too.  I know somebody will bring religion up and say it is against God's law.

I am going to need to talk to them about this.  Has anybody had this experience?  How do you have this conversation?  How do I respond to criticism or rude comments?  I am so nervous, how do I explain this to people?  Please give me advice.

Grew up in a conservative religious family, and I knew that anything outside the standard straight and narrow path of sexuality would likely result in my disowning.  Even though it caused me crushing guilt and shame for nearly two decades, at least it was a *secret*.

I'm married, I have a 1yr old boy.  My wife is 110% accepting of crossdressing in the bedroom. She actually likes it, since she enjoys the role reversal more than ""regular"" sex.  We've discussed doing ""girl's night out"" in the future, when I feel comfortable and reasonably passable.  In other words...she has been incredibly accepting and open and loving.  And we've talked about exploring it together here and there.

Unfortunately, this led me to do something stupid.  It led me to test the boundaries...I started asking her questions to find out just HOW comfortable she was.  She was VERY comfortable, and I just let loose...and I started talking about my family history and how I feel and exploring these thoughts and feelings with her.  Basically, we agreed that my son doesn't need to know about this, and I didn't want to transition/go full time because I knew it'd mean sacrificing the (now *mostly* healthy) relationships with my family.

My wife was SO unbelievably accepting about all this...she even helped me pick out a female name and she encouraged me to go ahead and paint my nails and wear them around the house for the day.  I was on cloud nine.  It brought about a clarity about my body image too...I gained a LOT of weight since moving out on my own, and I think that was just self-destructive behavior because of the shame.  The day she expressed this openness, I felt this huge release...like I don't need to eat to bury feelings anymore.  I am not trapped in this body.

Now why was this stupid?  Because I got so excited that I pushed thing way too fast, and I scared her, apparently.  I was openly sharing ideas about steps I could take to de-masculinize my appearance (shaving, skin care, growing my hair out) to make passing easier for the times I wanted to dress.  She said she was fine with me shaving my body, growing my hair long, practicing makeup, etc...

But...she came up to me that evening and said ""I am ok with you being a girl in the bedroom, but I don't want to live with another woman.  I want to be the woman in my house"".  She wasn't mean about it at all, but apparently something about the whole thing started to make her uncomfortable.  I held back tears and I told her I understood and apologized for pushing this on her so fast, and I left it at that.  Shortly thereafter, I removed the nail polish.

The biggest issue here is that this whole turn of events seems to have unleashed something in me that I didn't know was there.  I found a genuine desire to explore the possibility of living as a woman, and it's haunted me since.  To further add to the pile, we discussed whether I thought I was trans or gay (we figured out I was bi a long time ago), and she said that's fine if I am, and she'd support me, and we could even live in the same house so I could be with my son, but she'd have to divorce me.  

She didn't say it with any hate or judgement, but just stated that she married a man and she wants to be married to one.  I can't blame her for this...she can't change her sexual preference any more than anyone else.  How could I fault her for that?

So there was no anger...just sadness.  It really felt a bit like being told by someone you've been pining for that they just have no romantic interest in you...where your heart just *aches*.  I just don't know what to do.  I want to put the genie back in the bottle.  I want to un-ring the bell.  I want this to just be a fetish and an exciting occasional expression of femininity in a world where men aren't allowed to be soft or cry.

I'm just scared this sadness won't go away, and if it doesn't, I could lose the most important things in my life.

I guess I don't have a specific question, but I welcome any thoughts anyone else has.

**Edit:**  I'm not a guy who walks around depressed much.  I get bummed sometimes, I feel like I'm in a rut sometimes (job, personal development, etc...), but I'm not someone who gets really really down.  My wife noticed something was wrong IMMEDIATELY when I came home today.  She asked if I would talked to her about it, and I started to share what I was feeling.  Sometimes she doesn't communicate as clearly as I'd like, and in fact, she's usually the one resistant to in-depth conversation about our feelings.  Well, turns out, this was a case of poor communication.

As I opened up the issue before her, explaining my feelings and what I was struggling with, and circling around the ""do you think you're gay?"" track briefly...She revealed her real concern.  She was afraid I was trying to ""mother"" our son.  No wonder she freaked!  I would never try to usurp that role from her!  #1. Being a dad is the primary incentive for me to maintain a male identity...I want my son to have that because my real dad was a shithead!  He's got a GREAT mom already. #2. That's HER role...that's special...and I would NEVER mess with that.

So yeah...after that clarification, and reassuring her I had no desire to take her place as mom, we discussed more, and she's every bit as open and accepting and even enthusiastic about this whole thing.  I don't want to go full time.  I don't even want to do part time as some sort of a test.  If something changes down the road, that's fine, and we'll deal with it then...but for right now, I just need an *outlet* for this side of me.  And she's willing to facilitate that...right down to letting me shave smooth and buying me pretty smelling lotions and body wash.  She has no problem with me de-masculating at bit so I can switch back and forth easier.

I was at a cafe the other day and a trans lady and I made eye contact so I smiled. Not a pitying smile or a smirk just a regular friendly smile. I like to be nice to everyone thats just who I am. The dodgy drug dealer on the corner gets the same pleasantries from me as a sweet old lady doing her shopping does. Anyhoo, this simple exchange was met with this lady repeatedly screaming at me ""Have you got a f***ing problem you c**t"" over and over. I tried to explain by saying that I was just being pleasant and that it had nothing to do with who they were at all, I just do it to everyone because its simply a nice thing to do. I didn't even get a response to this, just more shouting and swearing. I ended up having to get up and leave, apologizing to everyone as I went. I was left feeling very embarrassed and concerned that I was seen as somehow being discriminatory.

Unfortunately, this is not the first incident like this that I have witnessed, although it's the first time it's actually happened to me. My question for you ladies and gents is how to make people feel more at ease and accepted in everyday situations such as this without making them feel pitied or singled out? Are certain people more prone to have adverse reactions such as this or did I do something wrong?

I'd like to make it clear that I do not believe that most transgender people would act this way nor do I want this to be a platform for judgement on anyone. I would just like to be able to get a better understanding of what I need to do to avoid situations like this in the future and how to make the transgender community feel more accepted in general.

Thanks so much!

I'm not even a big fan of my male voice. I've always had this whiney flange to it that has always been very unappealing and has led to some embarrassing attempts at asking people out. There's nothing wrong with it per se, like I don't speak out of my nose or anything like that, it's just not that many people seem to dig it.

So, what kind of tips could you gals (and guys) offer me? Any resources I could look into? Any specific specialist I could potentially talk to, keeping in mind that at the moment I have the budget of someone who's jobless? All of my current limited income is shortly going to funnel into my transition, seeing specialists, getting hormones, working on clothes etc. My experience with the science behind voices is incredibly limited and I won't understand the terminology at first, so I'd need something that's easy for a beginner to understand.

I don't have a recording of my voice yet, as I don't have a microphone set up. I'm thinking that'll help me figure out which methods of altering my voice work best towards my desired result.

I want to eventually become a voice actress, being able to fulfill the most girly roles (ok, that might be a bit of a stretch) to some of the more manly ones. That will be a long way away, but it's something to work towards.

There are a couple very old threads about this, but I wanted to ask again both for new people and new opinions.

I visited an ""informed consent"" clinic and will see the MD for hormone prescriptions on my next appointment in a couple weeks.  My current hypothesis [forgive me this, I'm a scientist and engineer :) ] is that I would love to (almost need to) transition, and should just get started already.  However, I am not 100% certain (I realize nobody is).  This is in part because of:

* implicit self-doubt (maybe some remaining internalized trans-phobia, not-yet-vanquished worries about AGP, etc.).
* because I do not utterly and completely *hate* being a man (e.g. not suicidal at the thought of not transitioning),
* fear of the costs, in terms of relationships, career, and potentially not passing as well as I'd like (physical features, not to be too vain).  If I could be happy doing part-time crossdressing for the rest of my life, it might be desirable just as a path of least resistance and lowest impact on my life overall.

Of course, these are almost textbook-typical worries, and I get that.

So a trial (3-4 months) would help determine some of this (e.g. **love** it or hate it).  And if I do decide to transition, it's a concrete step and one that I don't want to wait longer for (already mid-forties).

I'm a little afraid of not being ""able to stop"" (people describe euphoria and placebo effects -- the advice I've heard is ""things tend to snowball after starting HRT""), and of maybe losing some relationships (spouse especially, in particular) just for doing the trial itself.

So I'd be really thankful for whatever experience or wisdom people care to offer, especially reasons *not* to try out HRT (stuff I might not have considered) since I'm strongly inclined in that direction right now.

Thanks so much,

Robin =)

I just didn't think it was necessary for me.  After almost 5 years of HRT and 2.5 years of FT things are changing slowly but surely, with increasingly shorter periods of calm punctuated by feelings that I need it done yesterday.

Having already made a couple, well one at least, big surgical leap of faith that led to some results I'm less than happy with, I really don't want to make another.  I'm a bit concerned that hormones are actually inducing these feelings in me and I'm not sure that's such a great reason to move forward.

I'm hoping to see if there might be some common warning signs that I should heed.  I haven't yet started the gears turning on this but once I do, then things usually happen pretty efficiently for me, because I start becoming very single minded.

I'm having trouble believing myself, I sometimes feel like perhaps I've just made all this up in my head... that perhaps I've researched it so much, become so emotionally invested in the ""idea"" that I've convinced myself I'm in the wrong body.

I'm well aware this could be some method of denial, because of the fear of losing people I love.

I know for sure I have something wrong with me, a normal male wouldn't be here, research everything there is about the topic from age 13 (and know somethings up before the internet) all the way to the age of 27 and still keep these feelings to the point of panic attacks, constant bombardment into the forefront of my everyday thoughts etc.

Normal men don't deal with that stuff... do they?

I realize these are all things I'd need to speak with my therapist about. But there is something healing in writing my thoughts here, and connecting with others.

I know one thing for sure -- these thoughts aren't going away, even if I had convinced myself of them, and when I think about it that doesn't make sense anyway. 

A child of age 6 doesn't lie in bed at night with tears wishing in the morning, he looked like his sister, he doesn't ""convince himself"" of those thoughts, where would he get that idea from to begin with, unless it came to him naturally.

So I know don't want this to be happening, and perhaps I'm looking for a way out that doesn't involve changing what everyone knows about me. Ugh. It's so complicated isn't it?

There are thoughts like ""I would hate to give birth, I'd never want that to happen to me, how horrible."" So I think, if that idea does not sadden me, not being able to give birth -- then maybe I am a boy.

But I rarely feel like one. Always acting. If I could turn into a girl now without any repercussions I would, without a doubt -- and never look back.

If you asked me ""What if you could never pass as a girl?"" I instantly feel saddened, defensive, angry and defiant all at once.

I do feel like a girl, on the inside, but the constant reminder of my life tells me to be content with what I have. Part of me thinks I should try, but then another part of me says ""You've been trying for 27 years... do something about it already"".

If I should post somewhere else please let me know!

Throwaway because I'm pretty ashamed of these feelings and that why I'm looking for help/advice on what to do.

My brother (formerly my sister) has told me that he wants to transition to male full time. He's 19. I'd like to be supportive but at the same time, I'm not sure how much he knows about the process. He keeps talking about saving up for top surgery but hasn't said anything about testosterone. I don't want offend him by assuming he wants to, but I'd still like to make sure he's informed about all his options. 


Also, because he keeps talking about top surgery, I get the feeling that he's rushing into things, and understandably excited. It just all seems confusing to me because when we talked in the past he used to feel very positively about his breasts.


I guess overall, and I hate admitting this even to myself, I'm just unsure about him. I've always felt him to be a bit emotionally immature, and while I want to trust him to be true to himself and to know his identity without fail, he's been mistaken in the past. Back when he was younger (around 15-16, until at least 17-18) and still presented as female, he identified as lesbian. Since then he's made a complete 180, and now is attracted to only men (so he identifies as gay again).


I don't want to dissuade him, since our parents haven't been very supportive and I don't think he needs to hear this kind of crap from me. I plan on supporting him as best I can, but I can't help worrying inside that his feelings might change and he might do something that he regrets. I just don't know how to express these feelings without being a jerk. Mostly because I feel like I am a jerk. But I'd like to change that, I don't want to feel like this, and I want to be a good sister. I don't know what I'm looking for, I was just hoping you all might be able to give me some insight.

So if she waits more than a few more months to start hormones and anti-androgens, it'll probably become near-impossible for her to pass; she's really concerned about this.

Her parents are okay with her taking hormones - provided she waits 2 or 3 YEARS to ensure it's not ""just a phase"". By that time, she'll have a very masculine body and won't be able to change in a way that'll make her happy. She's been crying about this for days.

She needs some way to get a hold of hormones without her parents, because they refuse to accept that she needs them, or even that she's really trans.

Is there any way to do this?

If not, would taking female oral contraceptives seriously hurt her?

EDIT: didn't mean to offend anyone and I'm sorry if this seems crass. I'm all kinds of messed up about this and just feel so conflicted and confused. 

EDIT II: Best answer in this thread is from Tu-Val:

&gt;The idea being that most transformation stories happen without consent of the protagonist, releasing the subject from the shame of feeling good about it. Same reasoning with forced fem. You didn't have a choice, it just happened. So why not enjoy it?

&gt;The theory is that, rather than accept these ""other than default"" feelings of being non gender binary, we come up with, or get aroused by, elaborate fantasies that allow us to be feminine without fault. Either it magically happened, or we were forced.

&gt;Spend some time on fictionmania, most of the stories are forced or accidental. Even the stories about crossdressers usually end up with at least mild rape, thus allowing the ""straight"" crossdressers an out for why they really loved being cum upon.

&gt;Inner feelings of shame will often manifest themselves as fetishes.

I haven't posted on here much, but this community has been a great help to me for a while now.

I'm a software developer, and I just got fired from my job earlier today. I came out to my boss and supervisor in my yearly review (first one in a few years at that) a little over a month ago. I was fired, very clearly according to our conversation, because I came out as trans. I was thinking about moving on when I was ready anyways, but I would've liked to do that when I was ready instead of being forced out. I'm in South Carolina and the company is around 10 people or so, so I don't think there's any legal action I can take.

My boss is giving me another month and a half salary, which gives me some time to hunt for a new job at least.

I would really like to be out as a trans woman on my resume if possible. I'd rather not try to get a job as a man just to lose it when I come out.

I haven't legally changed my name yet, so I'm wondering how I might approach that on my resume? I can possibly try to push my name change through as soon as possible if that's the best route. I would like to find an LGBT friendly employer, so I'm hoping my legal name won't be too much of an issue. Is there a way I can put my new name in some form on my resume without causing problems?

I'm still kind of reeling, so I'm not exactly sure what else I'd like to ask. Any words of wisdom would be really appreciated though :)

This week has been the worst time of my life. I came out to my parents last week, and they seemed supportive initially. On the night that we had planned a family dinner to celebrate my birthday they just turned on me and spent the entire evening saying horrible things to me. I'm still trying to figure out how to talk to them next time to tell them I need some distance from them, without enraging my brother in law who scares me.

After all that I found I had a bed bug problem in my apartment, then I got fired.

I've been reaching out to a bunch of friends so far who have helped a lot, but it all still hurts. I'm going to contact my therapist again and see if I can get some more help from her as well.

1346183466.0,22,self.asktransgender,yz866,Planning on posting this to my FB along with changing name and gender. What do you think?,Jill_s,27,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/yz866/planning_on_posting_this_to_my_fb_along_with/,"I'm going to start this with an apology: This isn't going to be easy to read. It was even harder to write (for various reasons). The idea is to sum up about 25 years of experience into a concise account, and since some of these ideas and feelings are relatively new even to me, this will be a bit disjointed and all over the place. Anyway, here goes something...
 
You may have noticed the subtle (and not-so-subtle) changes I've made to my profile. You may be surprised to notice that I've unchecked the little male checkbox and instead checked the little female checkbox. Knowing me, your first instinct might be to assume that this is typical Jeff playing a hilarious joke on all his facebook friends. This is not the case.
 
I have never felt completely comfortable in the role of ""male,"" and some of my earliest memories involve some manner of gender dysphoria. When a child is presented with the confusing problem that their gender is incongruous with the overwhelming gender imperatives that society is crushing him/her with, that child has two options: either to be who they feel themselves to be and face the venom and violence that the world reserves for those who don't fit into the gender boxes their shoved into, or to play the role which they've been cast into, to internalize that role and to shut away those characteristics in themselves which might bring that ridicule and violence upon them.
 
This choice is not a hard one to make in Memphis, Tennessee; in fact, I wouldn't even call it a choice. The south  in general is a place that despises anything it does not deem to be ""normal."" So that's what I did: I played the role of a boy. ""Normal"" was never a label that stuck for me for reasons I'm sure you all know, but in the sense that I was playing the gender role that was expected of me, I was normal.
 
And I was good at that role. I was so good in that role that I was able to completely curb any femininity in myself, and in fact demonize all things feminine. I built up a male wall in my brain and denied that there ever were those thoughts that I was uncomfortable in the role I was playing; and there were those confusing thoughts, all the way into my adult life. The more they persisted, the more pervasive they became. I wanted to kill these thoughts, and that desire influenced some of the most dramatic choices I've made in my life, for instance the decision to join the military. Those of you who've known me long enough know how uncharacteristic that was of me. But it's important to note that through all of this, I did not know what it was that was plaguing me. The wall of denial I had built was strong enough to block out any specifics about what caused me so much pain, and just left me with a feeling of malaise at various points in my life.
 
It was this feeling of malaise which prompted me to finally seek some help earlier this year. As I said, I hardly knew what it was I was going into therapy to treat. What I did know was that in order to see any results from it, I would have to be brutally honest with the therapist and, as a result, myself. It was months after first seeking counseling that, like a flash, the denial was gone. I walked into an office that day a confused man and walked out an hour later as a VERY confused transgender person. The suddenness with which this awakening had occurred, paired with the enormity of the implications that it entailed plunged me into a very bad place for the course of about a month. I could hardly sleep, I could hardly eat, I woke up every morning and felt (quite literally) violently ill.
 
Since then, I've found support in so many places, som of which were pretty unexpected. I've made new friends in the trans community and the LGBTQ community in general, and have come to not only be ok with, but in a way to embrace the woman I've locked away inside of me for my whole life.
 
So now we get to the meat of this little piece of narcissism I'm writing: As of today, I am starting hormone replacement therapy. What this means is that I will be taking pills that will block my body from using the testosterone it makes, while at the same time filling it with the amount of estrogen needed to induce what is essentially a second puberty, albeit the correct one this time.
 
It's a huge deal for me, and I am all at once excited, hopeful, scared shitless, and worried. If there is one thing I'm sure of though, it's that I'm going to need the help and support of all my friends. That's where you guys come in. I know you're all awesome, so just keep doing that. It'll be easy.
 
If you have questions about all this sensational news, I'd be glad to answer them (within reason). I know that this transitition doesn't just affect me, but all my friends as well, so don't feel like you can't talk to me about this.
 
Thanks for reading my long diatribe and here's hoping you're just as excited for me as I am.
 
I love you guys. Each and every one of you.

I'm an aspiring author and I'm currently working on a story that includes a trans-male character. I want to make sure he's conveyed properly so on the advice of my editor, I'm looking for anyone who would be willing to talk to me about his (or her--I'm happy to listen/discuss with trans-female people as well) experiences. Or if there are other resources anyone can recommend, I'll gladly look into them.

We're not looking to make this character obviously transgender, nor do we want his character to be purely about that--one of the most important things I want to do with him is show that he's an otherwise normal person with normal (for the setting) problems. At the same time, though, I know that if the only thing that makes him transgendered is being transgendered, then he'll just be a token character. We're looking for input so we can convey and discuss real social problems surrounding transgender issues without it being the only thing his character is about.

Anyone interested in helping me with this can reply here or you can message me privately. I will keep everything in strict confidence.

And in the interest of full disclosure: the story I'm working on is a fanfiction so it's not the sorta thing that will see mainstream attention but I still take it very seriously.

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to respond. I look forward to hearing from y'all.

**UPDATE**

I'd just like to thank everyone who has responded so far. It's been very encouraging and I'm already starting to learn a few subtle things I was painfully unaware of previously.

Because there has been some requests for more specifics about the character in question, I'll go ahead and say a little more about him and the setting now.

I originally withheld that stuff for two reasons: I didn't want to leave spoilers around on a public forum and I recognize that the setting I'm writing in in very niche so I was concerned that being forward with that might disinterest people from responding. I'll go ahead and be honest now though: the story I'm writing is a recursive fanfic (a fanfic of a fanfic) in a crossover between Fallout and My Little Pony. I'm not even joking, [we have our own subreddit](/r/falloutequestria). (and don't let the ponies fool ya--this stuff can get *dark*)

I'm still trying to dance around spoilers here, so bear with me.

So this character (let's just call him Kevin) has grown up in a smallish isolated community. Pretty much everyone there knows him and though he's been marginalized in the community, nobody is openly hostile because there are external factors imposing a forced sort of ""get along"" mentality where acting aggressively can have dire consequences. Kevin is adult and has made his transition by the time he's introduced into the story (""freaky magic""/medicine-man kinda stuff as a stand-in for HRT). So while his transition won't be a major part of the narrative, it is something that'll be important to understand from what I've been gathering so far from everyone who's responded.

One thing, as I've mentioned in the comments, is that we have some relationship stuff planned between him and a cis-female character and so I'm particularly interested in how he should be reacting to her. In the beginning, she doesn't know he's trans and starts coming on to him (rather overtly). Later after he's revealed, she continues to show an interest in him, though she will probably be trying to act a little more modestly about it.

Another aspect we're interested in is conflict with another cis-female character (also a protagonist) who is actually repulsed by him when she finds out. (he has a prejudice against her for other reasons, basically racism) So I'm again looking for insight about that sorta thing--if you've ever been in a group of friends where one of them doesn't like you, that's the kinda experience I'm interested in hearing about. Especially if you were ever able to resolve things amicably.

Something we're not sure if we want to include or not is at some point later on in the story (towards the end of act 2 probably) is having him in a fight with one of the antagonists who is very intent on doing.. er.. some very unspeakable things to him. Kevin will of course be able to fight him off (or at least to a stalemate until someone can help) but I'm worried that a scene like this could be too difficult/controversial to get it right and I worry that it would draw too much focus to that part of his character and make him *about* that. So I'm interested in y'all's opinions on having something like that in the story. (**UPDATE**: the current consensus we've gathered is that we should cut this scene but we're still open to hearing opinions (good or bad) about it or suggestions about what would make a scene like this work. If not, we'll most likely be cutting it. Thank you to those who have responded, it's why we asked.)

I'm relatively young (24) but my face is...for lack of better terms: hard. I've got a heavy brow, big chin, wide jaw. I'm six foot three inches tall with broad shoulders and palms the size of cantaloupes.

Even with all these setbacks, I set out in my transition with high hopes and a sort of vain, childish hope that the girl inside me would shine through on the surface, because I'm still young. That she'd not only be passable, but maybe pretty, too. I watched minorqback's 14-month transition video on Youtube, saw how great she looked, and thought: ""This could be me."" Moreover I thought in the back of my head ""I *deserve* to feel good about myself. I *deserve* to feel pretty for how long I've suffered and dwelt deep inside a body that betrayed me at puberty."" It was basically fairytail hopes of good things coming to those who wait, of providence throwing me a bone for enduring this all my life. 

The first few months of my transition were filled with a sort of wild happiness and tremendous hope. Even if things weren't coming together in the way that I'd hoped, or in the way that I'd seen in all the videos of inspiring trans-metamorphoses, I told myself ""It's too early to make any calls. In a few months I'll start looking better, I'll start feeling better about myself."" 

Now it's been well over a year, and my fairytail hopes are all dashed. I have to accept that aside from never being pretty, I'll probably never be very passable. 

Stronger and less shallow people would swallow the pain, stand tall and persevere with the knowledge that looks aren't everything, and that so long as they know who they are, it doesn't matter what the rest of the world thinks. But I can't get past it. I can't get over the unfairness of it. Again, it's childish, but I just can't let it go. 

The hormones have opened up a spectrum (and an instability) of emotions that I didn't think was possible, and I've sought out the company of other girls for the openness and empathy that they have so readily at hand, and that I never find in my guy friends. I'm forming friendships with a group of cisgendered girls that I've met through a mutual acquaintance, and it feels wonderful to be with them, to feel accepted and affirmed. They're the nicest sort of people you could hope to fall in with, they tell me how pretty I am and treat me like one of the girls, for all my awkwardness and manishness. I know I should be happy, that I should take *this* as success in my transition that I've been waiting for. But it rings hollow when I realize that on some level, they're humoring me. That they see the same mannish face that greets me in the mirror every morning, and smile through my attempts at squeezing my deep voice into something that it's not. In the end, all their kindness just breaks my heart.

I wish I could stop obsessing over appearances and learn to love myself. I wish I could stop feeling so jealous of my new friends for their lovely looks and lovely voices, just as I've envied women all my life.

Do I have to pretend to be FtM?,FtNope,30,8,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/nuxyw/there_is_a_uterus_inside_me_and_i_want_it_out_do/,"**TL;DR: young, asexual, childfree, FtN (neutrois). Want a hysterectomy without taking hormones. Can I do this? Will I have to lie to my doctors about how I identify?**

First off, I apologize for the awkward wording in the title. I couldn't think of a better way to phrase it without saying ""my uterus,"" and I really don't think of it that way. It's not mine; it's just living here rent-free, and I feel that it's been a lousy tenant. Once a month or so it keeps me up at night, leaves the place a mess, and generally makes my life miserable. Not to mention, I've been putting off a maintenance (gyno) visit for far too long, and there's the ever-present threat that it might get sick, and then it might get *me* sick. Plus it's got this friend, the vagina, who insists that with the two of them around I can totally have sex and babies...unfortunately, I don't want those things, and so these promises are worthless to me.

So, I feel like I should be well within my rights to evict this sack of flesh which serves no useful purpose in my life. Unfortunately, the medical community seems to disagree. I know it is very difficult for young women to get any kind of voluntary procedure that might affect their fertility, much less something as major and irreversible as a hysterectomy. And while I know that many FtMs have this done, it is always part of a larger transitioning process which is not for me.

I don't identify as male any more than I do female. I don't care how people view or refer to me, and I don't feel the need to rid myself of breasts or hips or other female traits, as they do not interfere with living my life the way a uterus does. I don't desire a lower voice or thicker eyebrows or bigger muscles. The only thing I want to change about my body is the removal of this one particular organ...can I do that? Is there something like an ""informed consent"" process for hysterectomies? I figure if anyone would know, it's this subreddit...

If not, would I be able to achieve this by pretending to be FtM, and just...skipping the hormones? I'd be fine with changing my name to something androgynous. I could go either way on top surgery, but I'd rather avoid it if possible. I would like a total hysterectomy: removal of the uterus, cervix, and as much of the vagina as possible. Ideally, the end result would be something like a nullification, leaving no vaginal opening whatsoever. But really, I'll take whatever I can get. My goals are: no periods, no lady-doctors, no chance of baby-making (in that order).

As a potential third route, I do have some medical issues involving the uterus/vagina, and a strong family history of female cancers. Is it possible that I could play that angle and get a hysterectomy to treat physical symptoms and/or prevent future disease? I haven't researched this since it seems like a long shot, but maybe it would look ""less crazy"" to a doctor than being neutrois.

Finally...I know I will need doctors involved to make this happen, and I haven't been to a doctor of any kind in several years. Where do I start? If it helps, I live in a liberal area with lots of LGBT resources, and I do have health insurance (not sure if they'd cover something like this; how do I find out?). Will I need to see a therapist to ""prove"" that I'm sane and serious about it? This is something I've thought about ever since puberty, and seriously considered/researched for a few years now. I understand that it is a major surgery, I know there are risks, I am willing to accept the consequences should I someday change my mind about having kids, etc...

I'll stop there, as I think I'm starting to ramble. Thanks for reading, and I appreciate any kind of advice or friendly words. I've been lurking around here for a while and you guys always seem so helpful and supportive. Keep being awesome. :)

**Update (3 months later): Saw a very kind and gentle doctor in an attempt to diagnose the cause of my terrible periods. Ruled everything out, diagnosed with ""wonky hormones"" (her exact words). Was sent away with a BC script and the offer of a hormonal IUD for a more long-term option. Asked if she would consider doing anything permanent; she laughed at me and said, ""don't even go there.""

Here's the email a friend sent:

Sir, I am writing in regards to the Channel 6 Wate.com article, ""Morristown Transgender Woman Says She Went Topless to Make a Statement,""  posted two days ago.  This article claims that Andrea Jones was denied her request to change the gender marker on her Tennessee driver license.  
 
While I will grant that significant details may have been omitted from the article, I would like to bring your attention to the manner in which U.S. federal agencies handle requests to change the gender marker on official identity documents.  
 
As of 10 June 2010, the State Department permits the changing of the gender marker on a U.S. passport with signed authorization from a doctor.  The policy is very thoroughly detailed, and nowhere does it specify a type or title of a surgical intervention.  If you care to peruse it, please see the U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 7, Item 1300, Appendix M.  It is also available online.  
 
While there is not yet an official publication from Social Security on this topic, they also provide a mechanism for determining when to change a citizen's gender marker.  The FAQ page of Social Security Online, updated 10/10/11, states that there must be a ""letter... verifying that the sex change surgery was completed.""  Again, there is no mention of a specific type of surgery.  You may peruse the policy on the webpage, which is: 
http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1667/~/change-gender-on-your-social-security-record
 
I would imagine that you and/or your staff may not agree with the aforementioned policies of the State Department and the Social Security Administration.  However, in the interests of consistency, it would be unfair to expect Tennessee residents to bear identity documents which will necessarily conflict with documents issued by federal institutions.  
 
Therefore, I urge you to seriously and thoughtfully review the current policy of the Tennessee Department of Safety with regard to this matter.

I am a 29 year old guy, married with 2 kids, and I'm pretty confused :(

Quick back story, used to try on my sisters and mothers clothes and underwear when I was a teenager, i've thought for a while that it was just a sex thing for me then, but thinking about it more I clearly remember wanting to always wear womens underwear, always wanted to go to sleep in them and wake up in the morning wearing them instead of boxers, but was terrified that my Mum or Dad would pop their head in at night to check on me and see, if the covers had fallen off or something.

I joined the army when I was 19 and didnt really crossdress at all for years, fantasised about it, but never doing it, then when I was 26 I left the forces, met my wife and got married, had kids etc, I told my wife all about this, and she encouraged it, still does, saying that she loves me for who I am, not INSPITE of who I am, which is awesome , we've done so much in the past 4 or 5 years, and she's really made me slowly start to creap out of my shell, we go out shopping together for clothes, i've been out a few times fully dressed and made up, been to a MAC counter in guy mode and sat getting a foundation match in a packed dept store, started shaving my legs for a while and then actually started going out with shorts on + shaven legs, grown my hair long and started going to work in a ponytail, and this weekend, went and got ourselves some matching tattoo's, hers on her upper back and mine in a very sexy + feminine position on my hip, which I love!! 

This is all sounds great, and it would be, but its confusing the hell out of me, because I just don't feel like a guy, I get jealous of almost every attractive woman I see, its not the normal guy thoughts though, I want to BE them, not be IN them, is the easiest and bluntest (sorry) way I can put it :( I watch my wife getting dressed and I'm jealous of her curves and breasts and long thick hair that always looks good, she's said it before and I can't ever deny it, because its true, I want to be her.

Not related to my gender confusedness, but kinda because it shows a lot about my personality, I've also always wanted to hook up with guys, talking to them on good ol' AOL chat when I was younger and arranging to meet up but then bottling it, I joined the army when I was 19 and spent much of my early 20's in the following cycle on nights out every weekend, go out with friends and get drunk, slink off to a nearby gay bar and hang around outside scared to go in in-case I knew anyone in there, go back home and immediately get on webcams for guys, arrange to meet up, bottle it incase anyone found out, rinse and repeat.

I've always been painfully shy, and pretty socially awkward at times, always terrified of other peoples opinions and what they would do or say about the things that I like/wore etc. I think i'm starting to shake this now, with a lot of help from my wife, I recently went for a day out to a farm with my little girl, wearing some skinny jeans, a long, blatantly womens, cardigan and my hair tied back and put in some plaits, something which I would NEVER have done as little as a year ago, i really feel like I'm finding myself, but I'm not sure who that person is.

In a perfect world I'd have a smooth stubble free face, with a curvy shape and some boobs, which makes me sound trans, and for a while I thought I was (going on depression meds after imagining killing myself on the commute most mornings, and getting lost staring into a mirror thinking about stabbing my adams apple with some tweezers!), but I don't think I feel like a woman! :( and transition is also something I don't know if I could ever go through with, unless I was holding a gun to my head every night, but that won't happen as I am not desperately unhappy as a guy, and I get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about coming out into the open with all that and being out there for friends and family to disown and the world to laugh and stare at as I pass in the street.

I kinda wish there was a button that I could press where I wake up as a woman tomorrow, with my relationship intact, and my work colleageus acting like I have always turned up to work in a skirt and heels :(

Of course I was angry at the men's impatience, but their expletive actually made me feel good, sort of validated about my gender expression. Angry uncouth people not demeaning me based on my transness made me feel like I pass as female.

A ray of sunshine presented itself when my girlfriend presented the now-obvious-seeming possibility of simply not having SRS, but continuing with hormones anyway. I was however very disappointed to find out recently that anti-androgens will consistently wither your genitals and make their sexual function difficult, if not impossible.

As such, my questions for all you non-op ladies are:

- How satisfying is your sex life?
- Have you found a way to be able to keep topping after transitioning?
- How do the non-op yet extremely feminine porn stars pull it off?
- Can you take anti-androgens for a period, then stop once you have the body you want? Will genital size eventually return to normal?
- Can a feminine body shape be achieved with estrogen/progesterone and no anti-androgens?
- Is it possible to compromise and take only a partial dose of anti-androgens that leaves your sex life intact?

&gt;""No one chooses to be trans. This isn't a choice, I *had* to transition.""

I get that that's the case for lots of people. Many trans people would be pushed to suicide if they didn't transition. I'm fortunate enough to not be one of them. I'm not particularly dysphoric; it's more of a wistful longing to be female and jealousy of women, and vague dissatisfaction with my body.

I don't need to transition. I'm okay being a guy; being female just seems vastly preferable to me. Maybe that will change in the future and I'll absolutely need to transition, who knows. But for now, transitioning would certainly be a choice for me, and I still want to do it.

Does that make me less trans? Many people on this sub give me the feeling that, no, that doesn't matter. You don't have to *hate* your body for it to be okay to want to transition; you don't need to want to kill yourself or be horribly depressed to justify it. But so, so often I hear people shout ""no one WANTS to be trans. We don't CHOOSE this, it's a medical necessity for us to transition.""

I get that that's your experience, and I'm sorry that your dysphoria is that bad. It may not be a choice for you. But you're speaking for everyone else here, and that's unfair and makes people like me feel ""not trans enough."" Maybe I'm weird, but I *do* want to be trans. If I could take an accurate ""trans detection test"", and it told me ""nope, you're cis, no transitioning for you"", I'd be super unhappy. I want to be female. I want to be trans.

But hey, maybe I am in the wrong here.

I came out to my parents over a month ago, and my girlfriend, 17, a bit before that (she had guessed without telling me I was long before I told her, because I act myself around her). She was completely accepting. With her, I've been dressing up as a girl in private (pretty sure I already pass), doing some subtle things in public and I've had someone to talk to. Needless to say, my parents did not react well. When I came out to them, they acted as though they were completely accepting, despite the shock (they said I didn't show enough feminine behavior). As the past moth has gone on however, they have become increasingly less accepting. Recently, we got into an argument over the matter, in which they had rather wild reasons as to why I think I am trans but actually I am lying and this whole situation is stupid in their eyes. 

They said my girlfriend, who is bisexual, was simply isolating me and brainwashing me to believe I was transgender because if she did not have a girl, she was going to make me into a girl. I found this beyond stupid, as she could simply get a girlfriend, and not have to deal with the discrimination and other troubles of being with a transgendered person. They also believe this is some sort of scheme to kick my parents out of my life (Of course. If I were a cis-male I would totally want to become a woman /just/ to get rid of my parents who I had a great relationship with).

I maintain that I have had these feelings all my life, the dysphoria has been impacting my life for years, and I wish I could act more feminine like they would expect from a trans person, but society forbids it. They simply deny it. They continually try to convince me I'm really not transgender. ""You always used to act male"" (an extreme stretch, I didn't act feminine, but I sure as hell didn't act masculine). ""You enjoyed your first time having sex with your girlfriend"" (Because apparently if you have the wrong genitals, you can't enjoy the emotional part of sex. Obviously.). ""You don't dress up now. Don't girls enjoy dressing up?"" (well yes, but because male clothing is terrible. Why would I dress up in it?) and more exciting reasons.

And I might be too (FTM).,Transbat,29,6,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/15tkk7/my_sister_is_transgender_mtf_and_i_might_be_too/,"It's been over a year since I've accepted the fact that I am probably transgender (FTM), though I have been wondering for most of my life. I’ve never expressed my feelings to anyone but I think I am ready for a change now. Here goes:

It came as a shock when my sister came out to me as transgender (MTF) about six months ago; she told me that she has been out to her friends and our mother for years. Our mother is a traditional Christian, still calls my sister ""he"", objects the use of HRT, and loudly wonders why she got stuck with a family that “isn’t normal”. She is the only person in the house who works (two jobs) and is barely able to pay for food and the bills, so her objection to paying for hormones is not completely irrational.

When my sister came out to me, I couldn't help but question if I was really trans or if I was just making crap up. It feels almost wrong or selfish to come out knowing that my sister is two and a half years older than me and wishes to die if she can’t start HRT soon. In addition, it would be the breaking point for my mother which is painful to think about.

My point is that because of the set of circumstances above, I feel stuck in whatever this is. It seems to be the only thing I can think about nowadays. I am supposed to graduate high school this year (after falling behind and paying for it now), but I have very little motivation to do so. How should I proceed with getting help or “coming out”? Am I just going to have to wait? Is it even probable for there to be two biological siblings who happen to be transgender? I’ve tried to find people in a similar situation but was unable to.


This is the first time I’ve approached this issue anywhere outside of my own head, so it may be quite long. I just needed to get this out there. An answer to any of the questions in my rambling or any advice would be very much appreciated – thanks in advance.

(tw: suicide, depression)",,27,4,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/14w5de/how_do_i_survive_the_holidays_tw_suicide/,"I came out to my parents last year, right before Christmas, the first year I'd lived away from their house.

They are Mormon. They were extremely abusive when it was convenient for them, a fact I was slow to realize because I was homeschooled and autistic and very naive and devoted to them and their church when I was younger. They did not take it well.

I'd been battling depression, dysphoria, and sometimes suicidal feelings my whole life. This year it was turned up to eleven. My freelance work output was basically halved; I have at least two or three depressive episodes a week, and persistent suicidal thoughts. I started taking St. John's Wort for the depression, and it helped some but it also caused me to gain like 4 kg because it messed up my ability to feel satiety signals.

I've presented as female in public all of twice this whole year. Of those times, one was terrifying and ended in a horrible suicidal episode that I barely survived. The other was breathtaking, and made me wish my entire life could be like this. It was while I was surrounded by supportive associates at a conference, though, so I can't recreate that situation.

The only way I've survived this year is because of the emotional support of my live-in significant other, and the emotional and financial support of my new boyfriend, whom I'd known for years but entered into a relationship with soon after my family threw me away. Unfortunately, he lives a very long way away.

I've never lived anyplace more than six years. I've lived here about a year and a half now. I have no close friends anywhere near me in person. None of the passing acquaintances I've made here really know how to relate to a depressed, autistic, transgender abuse survivor. My live-in SO is going to spend the holidays with their family. Said family doesn't want me there this year, because they think I'm their evil boyfriend who is turning them against their family (I actually helped save them from what was an abusive situation, and may have made my feelings on this matter known).

I look in the doors at other people's homes and see trees and lights and the uncluttered floor of a nondisabled family that has the ""spoons"" to keep up with things. I remember watching the tree with the lights turned out, and seeing stacks of presents, and being surprised by my mom with more gifts than I'd even asked for. I remember a huge stocking filled with candy, and jam, and lip balm and hand lotion. I remember watching my brothers try out their new video games. I remember helping make Christmas dinner. I remember reading aloud the Nativity verses. Everything around me reminds me of a million things I'll never have again, that I miss so bad even though my gene donors think I ""can't remember the good times"" just because I asked why they beat me and threw me out and scared me to death of my body.

I'm scared that I won't survive Christmas.

The local LGBT centre is doing something for Christmas, but I'm going to have to walk for an hour to get to the train station, since nobody's answered the request for a carpool / ride. The kind lady across the hall who goes to the UCC is probably spending it with her family, but she doesn't know me that well or even that I'm trans. I have at least one gift to open, that my ""adopted"" sister online sent to me. I don't know what else to do.

Please tell me how to not die, and how to not go through this again next year. I haven't even started on hormones yet or anything, and I feel sick just thinking about how much progress I could've made. I'm just terrified to show my face outside when I have breasts. My SO is even more socially anxious than I am, and I don't feel confident in their ability to save me from a bad situation, and I don't know if I could survive so much as a stern look or a voice slip at this point.

In all my social interactions I’ve completely dropped my guard and stopped acting insecure – I’ve always been a bit cocky and dismissive to people in a joking kind of way to try and make friends with people (this is a ridiculous way to behave, I know) who I would desperately like to connect with. It’s only been 4 days since I started on 100mg of spironolactone and 2mg of estradiol and I actually feel really calm and free from my normal protective personality.

Has anyone else had this experience where you’ve found you’re a better, more wholesome person on HRT? I find this prospect pretty scary. I never actually considered transitioning and now it seems like a real possibility. A couple of questions: 

1. How long on HRT do people generally start feeling emotional changes? Could I just be experiencing a placebo effect?
1. If I choose to stop, how long will it take for me to feel normal again? Including physical changes like major loss of libido, breast soreness?

I realise I need to see a therapist pronto and have already been placed in a waiting list. I just thought I’d get some feedback from the community while I wait.

I am not entirely sure how to start this.  I've been turned down in the past, (and hurt on occasion), but continual rejections are really starting to wear on me and get me down in a way that's never happened before.  


My last serious relationship ended a little over a year ago.  I took some time to just work on me, and enjoyed the single life for a while.  I finished up my school year, moved to a new city, got a new job, etc.  However in the last several months I've found myself getting lonely, craving intimacy, (and sex) and generally really wanting a relationship again.  So over the summer I've started actively dating again, trying to meet people, etc.

And ugh, my self esteem...  The process usually goes something like this:

1. Meet guy, get along great
2. Go on date. It goes wonderfully!
3. Perhaps another date, fool around a little
4. Before anything serious happens physically, I try to have ""The Talk"", which is basically working up the courage to admit, ""Hey, I used to be a boy, are you OK with that?""
5. Bam, he never wants to see me again.

I've gone out with four men since the start of the summer, and every single time it's ended like this.  I try my best to stay positive.  My therapist says that it's a limitation on their side, and not on mine.  

It's really hard to believe that.  It's really hard to see myself as anything other than flawed or broken or whatever.  I *do* still have inferiority issues surrounding my body.  Stuff like this just kills me.  It feels like no matter what I do or how well we get along, my past comes back to destroy any possibility of a relationship.  

I don't know what to do about it.  This obviously isn't the first time it's happened, but one after the other, again and again, it's completely destroying my self confidence.  I don't know how to approach it and it makes me anxious as hell.  If I tell a guy too soon, he'll never bother to get to know me and will write me off immediately.  If i wait too long, they get mad and feel deceived, (and I've been physically hurt once because of that).  It just feels like I'm walking on eggshells, and that I'll never find someone because of something I have no control over.  I hate it.  It's making me hate *me* as a result.  I thought I left all this behind years ago.

Last week I had the most wonderful 2nd date with a guy.  There was physical chemistry, we had similar goals in life, similar hobbies, conversation flowed well, etc.  We went out for a lovely evening and ended up talking for literally hours until midnight on a bench by a lake.  It was wonderful.  He started getting frisky and I kept putting it on hold and saying we needed to chat first even though I was getting crazy horny myself.  I told him the next day, (I learned from my mistake and never tell them in person and alone), and poof, never wants to see me again.  Says he ""had a great time and a lovely evening,"" but that he could ""never be in a relationship with someone like you.""

Fuck.  Me.  

How do others deal with this stuff?  When do you bring up your past with a guy?  Again it feels like too soon and they'll never even bother to get to know me.  Too late and you ""mislead"" them or something.  Uggghhh.  It's just horridly demoralizing.  Call me dramatic but I start to worry that I'll never find someone, or I'll have to settle or whatever.  I've had successful relationships in the past so I know it's doable, but ugh it just feels like dating is so much harder than it needs to be.  I hate it.

I spent about an hour and a half round trip to Goodwill, only to walk in, hang around the book section, get freaked when I see other women looking at stuff, and walked out.  I'm going to need to find a friend who will help me out on that front, I think, because that's one hump I just can't quite get over.   I'll keep at it, though, and do it each weekend until I eventually succeed.

Anyway, bulky, uncomfortable man-clothes aside it went great.  I just told people I'm Gwen, female pronouns please(if they asked), and they went with it.

It was a great experience, and I'm looking forward to getting more involved with the community once the term starts up.

What can I do to handle the situation?,,22,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/104eoa/my_sister_bullies_a_transgender_girl_what_can_i/,"Background: My sister is an emotionally disturbed child who was adopted from foster care (at age five) after severe neglect and abuse.  She is thirteen now, and has very little empathy for anyone other than herself.  She is disruptive, anti-authoritarian, inappropriate sexually with children and adults (male and female), and has a tendency to bully children perceived as different or weak.  

To put myself through school, I work through a service designed to assist parents of delayed, at-risk, and emotionally disturbed children.  As a favor to my mom, I've taken on my sister as a ""client.""  I go to her classrooms unannounced, report on her behavior, have ongoing dialogue about her behavior with her teachers, and do my best to prevent her from bullying other students in my presence.  

Recently she has been mocking a sweet transgender girl named ""Cal.""  Cal is permitted to use the staff bathrooms to avoid uncomfortable encounters with students who knew her before she came out.  My sister was part of one of those ""uncomfortable encounters.""  When not being supervised, my sister spreads nasty rumors about this girl to classmates, teases her about being ""freaky,"" and tell her that since Cal is ""a girl now"" she ""shouldn't be so fat"" (Cal is not a thin girl).  It appalls me that my sister has decided to target this girl.  It is not the first time my sister has tormented girls at her school; two girls have changed schools and three others have taken out ""no contact orders"" against my sister, because of her bullying.  I am only present at my sister's school a portion of the day, and not every day of the school week.  What can I do to improve the situation?  I know how vulnerable adolescent girls are, and a complication like coming out as trans just adds to the difficulty, especially in middle school where girls are the cruelest.  I have no experience with transgendered individuals, and have only in the last two years educated myself about gender and sex and the difference between the two.

TL:DR You really need to read it, but: my sister is an emotionally disturbed bully and I'm in a position to interfere with her bullying of a trans girl.  What can I do to help?

EDIT: Thanks for the advice and comments, I appreciate it.  I know it's not necessarily a transgender-specific problem (Cal is certainly not the only victim), but I am new to LGBT issues and wanted to make sure that I don't make things worse for an already vulnerable girl.",,False,,t5_2r4b9,1348065168.0,,,True,t3_104eoa,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/104eoa/my_sister_bullies_a_transgender_girl_what_can_i/,
1348021003.0,23,self.asktransgender,1045ff,MTF - And not planning on making the transition. Ever. A story/rant/spiel thing.,Throwawayridesforth,24,1,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1045ff/mtf_and_not_planning_on_making_the_transition/,"So, this is my little story/rant/rave/vent, whatever you want to call it. Maybe a little bit of each. This is coming from a six-month lurker or so, and today I decided to…I’m not sure. Post this to get it off my chest, maybe see what other people have to say about it. Putting it all into words will certainly be helpful in any case, I would think. So here goes.

I fairly recently came to accept the fact that, hey, I am pretty transgendered. MTF, attracted to women still. I guess that makes me some sort of male lesbian? Whatever. I’ve never been overly feminine, but that part hasn’t concerned me – then again I’ve also never been particularly masculine. In lurking this and the other related subreddits, I’ve found myself resonating with the questions people pose to those questioning their status:

* If you could change genders tomorrow, would you?
* If you were alone on a desert island, what gender would you choose to be?

…and other things of that nature. In addition, when I read the Null HypotheCis, the paragraph about what Cis people don’t do really got to me. I do, in fact, obsessively dream about being the opposite sex; I do secretly use every wish, be it on an eyelash or a first star or a birthday cake, wishing to wake up the next morning magically transformed. Next step should be talking to a therapist or something, making the transition, right?

But I really don’t think I am going to do that. Maybe it’s cowardice, or laziness, but *that* isn’t something I want. I’ve convinced myself I wouldn’t pass, in voice or in plain physical appearance, and in either case I feel like it wouldn’t help what I feel inside of myself. Maybe it’s petty, but when I see people who have made the transition, it fills me with fear about taking that step for myself, fear of ending up some sort of Rocky Horror reject if I tried to.

I’ve always been socially anxious, as far back as I can remember, but at least in my head I imagined that if I had a female body I would be…more confident, I suppose. It might not work out that way, but whenever I needed to do something, doing it in *my* girl body would be what I fixated on as I imagined how to do it, and that would typically get me through. Maybe I am full of high standards or something, but the way I worry I would end up looking, I don’t think it would give me any confidence; if anything, it might erode what little I have managed to build.

So at least I have the Internet, where I’ve been masquerading as female for nearly a decade now (I am 23 currently). I don’t change anything about my personality, and yet I somehow manage to come across to my friends there as confident and generally awesome. I’ve even tried to come out to one of them, who responded to me insisting I was male with “Bullshit,” if I am not mistaken. But that, my Internet friends who all accept me as female, is where I spend pretty much all of my time, in a safe environment full of confidants. I certainly don’t have a problem with it, but sometimes I think I’d like to meet some of them, many of whom are not overly far away.

I don’t even know if I have a question, so I will try to make one. Anyone have a similar situation to mine, have any insight as to what my next move might be? I’d really rather not stay the way I am, hating myself, denying myself basic things as a sort of penance for whatever I did to end up this way. But then again, I’d really rather not draw the ire of the rest of the world for something that might not even make me feel any better. 

Really sorry if what I said was offensive to anyone. I don’t mean to say that trans people are hideous or anything, I just…I don’t know. I’m trying to say, I guess, that when I see pictures of people into their transition, that is never what I *thought of myself* as, and that’s a scary thought.

My family is ultra-conservative, and very religious. So this was a problem. Mother tore into me, asking if I'd been raped, if some guy had touched me.

I'd prayed and prayed, in the past, and it just didn't happen... 

She told me to accept the body God gave me. So I said ""if someone is born with an extra arm, and they want it removed, are they going against God, too?

She doesn't understand, she's unsupportive, and says ""you're just thinking like that because you're lazy, and don't want to do chores."" That just blew me away.

If this is going to bother you, well, ***stop reading.***

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Okay, so a little timeline. I started HRT in 2002. In 2008, I realized that I wasn't going to have the funds any time in the next ten years to get GRS, so I decided I'd scrape together what I could and go get an orchiectomy (Snipped, in the vernacular), so I could stop fighting my body quite so much on a chemical level.

Had this done at Lake Oswego Plastic Surgery by Dr. Tuan Nguyen. He was very professional and I felt it was pretty well handled. However,  because I was doing this on the cheap, I couldn't afford to stay in the hotel very long after. Also, I didn't have anyone to drive me or pick up pain meds for me so I was walking right afterwards. 

I messed up on the way home and gave myself a hernia, (bled into the space where my nuts used to be.) I called the doctor and he said it'd pass on it's own, which it did.

I expected some phantom pain, I knew it was a possibility, but it's still pretty bad. My main problem is this: if I get aroused for any length of time and don't orgasm, I'm in a world of pain. Sometimes, especially after this happens, an orgasm will cause massive pain, akin to getting sharply kicked in what I no longer have. Obviously, this is not fun.

So here I lay, curled up in pain, and I turn to you, Reddit. Any advice or thoughts as to what the heck I can do about this? Am I just fucked? :P",,True,,t5_2r4b9,False,,,True,t3_yeev0,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/yeev0/five_years_on_after_an_orchiectomy_still_getting/,

Well the day went on a bit more and I started talking to her more and more about it, and basically asking her if she thought I could pull one off and all that.  Then finally she asked the question that I had myself been dancing around for so long ""Do you want to be a girl?""  I paused for a bit and told her that the idea was very strong in my head from the time I was about 3 or 4 and that I had just now come to terms with it myself, and she was the first person I felt I could talk to it about.  She asked me a few questions about why I felt this way and stuff like ""Do you want to date guys?"" I don't, and its not even a reason for considering.

I came to school, she walked into the room, I apologized if I offended her and asked if we could talk. She handed me a manilla envelope and told me to leave. 

I admit I'm prone to emotional episodes, but I have never made it noticeable to any of the clients, and I certainly have never had an outburst of anger. Those who know me can tell you I barely get pissed off enough to call someone out. I get shakey when I even attempt to stand up for myself, and try to instead reason with the person who made me mad in the first place. I much prefer peace over anger.

If I even HAD an emotional outburst, they would blow over quickly, in private, and frankly should not even matter in a hair salon. They say they've been very patient with me, and they have, but I'm being kicked out ""for the safety and well being of the students and staff"".

I don't think I look dangerous. When I get angry, I look more worried than scary, and I'm the definition of ""adorable"", there is NO WAY POSSIBLE that I am a threat to anyone.

I don't believe for a single second that this is the real reason. I think I'm being discriminated against for what I am. I think she just wants me gone, for whatever reason, and just came up with some flimsy reasons that were good enough. 

The thing is about all of this.. things were perfect. She was supportive and a great teacher.. It's like she all of a sudden flipped on me after I confronted her about outing me. Red goddamn flags all over the place. I know I may get frustrated and I may get emotional, but I have NEVER had an outburst of anger, not before then. 

And it's not just me she has a problem with, she talks shit about a lot of the students there, and not general things either. Homophobic, bigoted, opinionated things. 

There are two gay girls who work with us, and though one of them is an amazing stylist and a wonderful person, she talks about her like she's gross, and whenever we mention her she kinda scoffs and doesn't want to talk about her. The other girl she's had a wonderful relationship with until she found out she had a girlfriend. She kind of didn't talk to her or even look at her after that.

She said all single/teen moms are sluts and don't deserve ANY help from the government. There were two girls there, one was a single teen mom (35 now and doing fabulously), one had a single teen mom (under scary pretenses as she explained) and they brought this fact up to her after she said that, and my teacher said to their face that they were sluts.

She acts really weirded out and distances herself from the little person that works with us. She told me she wears it on her sleeve and shouldn't. I think that disgusts me more, because she can't really hide it from anyone like me or the gay girls that work with us.

That's not to say of all the times she's intentionally ruined something I was doing. A client wanted a blowdry, and I did it and asked her for help getting some hairs to lay down, I needed to finish it quickly because she had a photoshoot. She COMPLETELY redoes what I was doing (with a curling iron which the client did not want) and the client missed her whole lunch break AND missed the photoshoot AND had a hairstyle they didn't want. And after she left my teacher had this look on her face like ""The client was late because of you. This is YOUR fault because you suck at what you're doing.""

She's cut random bits into my haircut and tried to explain she was ""notching"". You're not supposed to take GIGANTIC SLICES out when you do that. 

I had a little girl as a client and she yanked the hose away from me as I was washing her hair to show me how to do it properly, and then soaked her neck/shoulders. 

I was done what I was doing in every one of those examples, and instead of telling me what to do, she just goes ahead and does everything for me, and when I tried to do it as well, she just would not let me try.

This is not over. Not for a single second. I don't have the proof that she outed me, but the pieces are all there, and they're starting to fall into place. I will not let this matter go until she is brought to justice or at the very least goes to sensitivity training.

I just needed to calm down and feel better last night, but I realized I want someone to talk to, for support.

I'm to man shaped to ever dress as a woman, too deep voiced to talk like a woman, and too hairy. I always felt kinda off being noticed as a big muscular guy, and not being the person I've dreamed of. 


I just want to know why I feel this way, I feel awkward not only as myself, but also posting here. Anyway, here's the post from last night and two beers ago.

Let me explain. I'm a guy who kinda feels like a girl on the inside. I'm a guy as far as personality, but then sometimes I talk to a girl and sometimes wish I had breasts like her. Normally, I'm fine in my skin - in my body, but when I look at the mirror I sometimes surprise myself with a reflection I forget is mine. I guess I am prepared to see a woman starring back at me. If I ever draw a woman, or a girl on paper, I project myself as if I was what I drew instead of a square jawed, large chested guy. I'm not gay; I am attracted to other girls, I...

I don't know. I just don't... I feel like I'm a split between personalities, a person who doesn't mind being a guy, working on cars - and a woman who wants breasts and long flowing hair. I've had moments where I've almost corrected a person when he/she says ""he/him"".

Gah, I feel so weird.

Edit: I honestly have no words to express how grateful I feel for the comments. I'm reading them all, but I can't think of anything to say to the individual posts, well, other than ""thank you"".

Thanks to all of you for keeping me sane while I deal with this 'gender crisis' and the relationship problems its caused me. Many of you have commented on other posts I've made and have really given me some great advice and perspective.

I just thought I'd share something I remember as a kid I thought was funny. 

Maybe some of you have had similar experiences. When I was a kid I always had a fascination with any program about transgenderism that might come on the tv. I've seen a fair bit over the years. You know the Discovery channel or Discovery Health documentary type programs about the subject. One night when I was probably about 9 years old I remember watching one of the late night news programs probably 60 Minutes or Dateline. 
I can't remember many specifics of the program just alot of stock footage of doctors in lab coats holding up x-rays and people riding bikes.

Now, what I think happened is the program had two stories that night.
One was about health benefits of biking or malfunction bikes, not quite clear just something about biking. And the other story I think was just something on Intersexed people possibly trans people as well. 

I'm not actually sure what it was I saw, because my conclusions seem, of course, ridiculous now. But in my little 9-year-old mind I construed the program that night to be just one big long story on how riding bikes could make you change sex sometimes. And that if you had the  specific bike featured in the program or rode your bike enough ^sometimes if you were this rare percentage of people or whatever the bike would make your body spontaneously start to change sex.

Naturally, I rode my bike rather alot after that. Its real funny to me now because its such a dumb kid thing to think. But it was probably one of the first times I can remember feeling like I wanted to be a girl. I can remember riding my bike around but being confused about it and thinking myself ""Wait Soo, I want to be a girl?"". Or being angry that it wouldn't happen to me or that I didn't have the right bike. 
It makes me laugh in retrospect, I just thought I'd share. Perhaps some of you had your own 'dumb kid' thoughts about your trans feelings.",,False,,t5_2r4b9,True,,,True,t3_ppmlg,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/ppmlg/the_time_i_thought_bikes_caused_spontaneous_sex/,

So, is it okay for trans women to be more feminine than usual? I just really like makeup, dresses, skirts, heels, the whole nine yards, and I figured that if it was just a stage, it would have already passed. It has yet to, and I've been at it for a good six months now. On top of feminine presentation, I also tend that way with mannerisms, voice, and relations with others. I've been accused of contributing to 'too much estrogen' in the room. My therapist told me that I need to tend more drab so as to blend in (college student), but given that I pass virtually all the time, why not 'be me' and have a little fun with my style? Toning it down feels just as awkward as pretending to be a dude. 

Forgive me for being a stereotype? (At least I'm not in CS, although statistics isn't much better...)

So, suggestions? Is hyperfemininity indeed just a stage? Is it something that should be worked through, assuming it even can? Any chance I'm compensating because I don't feel like the most attractive woman in the world?

[I came out to my parents when I was 15](http://i.imgur.com/TchMF.jpg).

We agreed to see a psychologist, who's opinion was effectively ""You know exactly who you are, what you need to do is take the next step."" That step was talking to my parents. As I said, my mother's come around. But it turns out my dad hasn't changed an iota since I came out.

He ""has no problem with trans people,"" and claims to accept me if I make that decision (As if there's a decision to make), but, and I quote, ""cannot help or support me.""

For over a year I had reoccurring nightmares about this. It got to the point where I was afraid to go to sleep.

I am currently looking for male to female and female to male transssexual identified volunteers to participate in a 10-15 minute online study. The study has received approval from the Carleton Research Ethics Board for Psychological Research (Certificate Number 11-182).

The questionnaire consists of asking questions about demographics (ex: age, gender identity), transitioning (ex: how many people are aware of your trans identity), experiences of transphobia and how stressful that was (ex: have you ever been treated unfairly at work because of your trans identity), and personality (ex: a rating of how well a variety of words describe you such as ""understanding"").

Hopefully this research will help shed light onto some of your complex experiences.

I mean, if someone is actively using slurs against us, that's one thing. In fact, if someone is unwittingly spreading hate or ignorance without any wrong intentions, let's be firm in our feelings on that too!

But what I feel I'm seeing a lot of here (coupled with my memories of when I was first posting to this forum) we have situations where if GOD FORBID a fellow member is reading from a different glossary, we unleash the hornets!

Words like ""Stealth,"" ""FFS,"" ""SRS,"" ""GCS,"" ""GG,"" ""Transgender (adj.),"" ""Transgender (n.),"" ""trans-man,"" ""transman,"" ""trans man"" are all terms that are used by various sources and community members.

I understand that some of these words have connotations that may sting. (I have felt slighted by some of those terms myself.) However, I feel that the reality we face is that *there is no standard accepted glossary* for this yet, and acting hostile towards each other (especially newcommers!) over alphabet soup and missing white space is not productive. In fact, I would say that it probably ""others"" us even further. (What other community polices relatively obscure uses of terminology so harshly?)

I'm wondering if I should just go back to dealing with being a guy.  It wasn't the end of the world, I guess.

And aside from all that, my superiors have scolded me for trying to move fixturing I was able to move, telling me that I should have guys do it instead.

It's slightly flattering that people see me as a little thing worth preserving, but some of these people would not let me run for fear I should fall. When there's a physical challenge I know I can overcome, they won't even let me try. It's frustrating and I don't know how to fix it. And it's upsetting that after concluding that society's expectations of males did not fit me, I'm beginning to feel that it's expectations of females somewhat don't fit me either. My friends call me princess as a term of endearment, but I am not a damsel in distress; and nobody seems to hear me no matter how loud I yell it.

I'm 22 years old right now. I work from home, I have a stable girlfriend and great job (Full benefits :D)

I have also been feeling this whole transgender issue since about 15/16(i'm MtF) which is fairly normal (for transgendered people) the problems I've had is the same ones most people had, 

&gt;1. I don't hate my body, I don't hate my dick, I don't hate anything (Ok, maybe the hair, ew.) 

&gt;2. Am I really transgender? 

and finally the big one i've been struggling with recently

&gt;3. I don't feel completely like a woman 100% of the time, sometimes I feel like a boy.

I'm going to give you my answers to these in order

&gt;1. You don't have to be self hating to be trans. If you feel like your inside doesn't match your outside and &gt;you have the will to change it, that is enough. 

Some people think of their body as a something not to be damaged, no tattoos(because who knows how it will look when you're 50), no piercing(or very few) etc etc.

I however believe that your body is just a work of art. It is your home, you should style and decorate your home how you like it. For me this means body hair removal, make up, wigs depending on the day, and for some people it could mean SRS. Bottom line and golden rule I stick by: If it makes you happy, and causes no undue harm to you or the people you care about, then go for it. 

Obviously some of this can be a serious decision but at the end of the day, its your body and your life, and selfishly, your happiness should come above, but not at the expense, of others.

&gt;2. I've been reading r/asktransgender for awhile now, and my thoughts are this: If you're questioning, and you've been questioning awhile, you probably are, no one can tell you, they can just share their experience and you can sit on here for years waiting for someones story that is just like yours in order to validate yourself. But why? you only have one life to live, so get to it. No time to waste.

I will tell my story briefly, 10/11, always used to dress in moms clothing 13/14 dreamed about being a girl 15/16 wrote a note outlining reasons that I wanted to be a girl (parents found it but I brushed it off and hid it) 17-21 denial, regression, thoughts about transition, rinse and repeat until 22 where I've started transition, which brings me to my 3rd point.

&gt;3. I don't feel 100% female all the time, and sure I'd like a vag, but i'm probably not going to go through SRS, because I don't like the results people are gettings and its expensive and time consuming.

If I had to put a number on it, i'm about 70%female 30% male, maybe a little more male then that. But thats ok, that doesn't make me not trans. it makes me who I am.

And this is what i'm doing about it: I'm starting transition, I'm doing things to make my body into my home where I feel comfortable.

For some people this would mean SRS, Full time, etc, for me it doesn't, and i've started questioning the whole gender binary thing in a serious way.

I'm going to be both, boy and girl, and I'm going to do what makes me happy.

What I want to do is get most body hair removed, lighten the beard a lot, remove all other body hair, and start hormones. I'm not going to stick to a gender binary, I'm going to be in-between where I feel myself. 

I'm going to have tits, and curves and semi long hair(to my chin). But my goal is to be able to toe the line of androgyny, somedays on the female side, some days on the male side. I realize this is difficult and I may not reach this goal, but its who I am, and I'm fighting for it.

If you've gotten this far in my post my words of advice to are this:

Be who you want to be, please, for yourself. Don't let someone stop you. Think it through, be honest with yourself, and just go for it. No one is holding you back except for yourself.

I guess I just feel like you will see things in best light, show interest/empathy, and understand how trans issues play into life. :) 

So I hope you don't mind my crazy openness about sex, but I can't seem to find any place on the Internets that has a real good discussion about sex for trans women. (And I think it's important to discuss.)

Anyway I somehow ended up with a boyfriend (my first one evar), go me. 

* Me: Pre-op MtF late 20s, hormones for 8-9 years or something.
* Him: Cute straight boy early 30s, cis.
* (Look everyone she has a boyfriend! :P)

We have issues with my pre-op genital configuration. Our solution so far has been having anal sex. It is way different/better than I expected, but very enjoyable on many levels. It sends shivers through my body just thinking about it all. 

Sadly I still haven't quite had an orgasm. Sometimes I start ""heading in that direction"" and it feels amazing, and I get this incredible feeling of closeness with him. But it's quite elusive and doesn't last long. I can't say sex with him as been a bad experience at all. I just want to figure myself out so that I can have orgasms too. (And I know he would like me to have one too.)

**Problems / Good things / Questions / Etc: **
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1.) Neither of us like my ""equipment"" all of that much. **

* I know it turns him off, so I don't think there is much of a chance of manual stimulation. (But I haven't asked.)
* I am not even sure how he would feel if I ""helped myself"" so to speak. 
* Do you think time will help this at all?
* He does like anal sex however, quite a bit.
* Are there any ways to approach it without causing either of us insurmountable issues?

**2.) I have that worry hanging over my head about how he feels about my genitalia, which is likely a little 
distracting. (And I have quite a bit of dysphoria over my own genitalia.)**

* It also makes me feel funny knowing it's there and not knowing what to do with it I guess.
* I should likely be talking to him about this, but the last time we talked about it I ended up crying. :&lt; (And I know he was upset too.) So I wanted to try a different route first. 
* I am doing all I can to get surgery, but I have an illness complicating the situation.
* Not having sex isn't really something I will consider, especially since I can't stop thinking about him.
* How do you handle it? 

**3.) In the past I have only been with women, but none of them had as many issues with what I have between my legs as the average straight man. And, well, having sex with women is just a little different I guess.**

* I am trying to figure out what to incorporate from my past experiences, but I am not really that ""experienced"" anyway. Have any fun ideas? 

**4.) I also have a chronic illness, with medication that doesn't make this an entirely easy process all of the time, even alone.**

* I've made him aware of this, but that is about all I can do.
* I have also made him aware that I have enjoyed our encounters thoroughly even without an orgasm. (It is the truth.)
* Anyone know what other sick people do about sex? 

**5.) Are there any ways to improve the anal sex part? (You may not want to read this part.) **

* When he makes me feel the best he is usually ""going at it"" quite hard. I almost think it is just the pressure he is applying in that general region as I have tried that when masturbating. (Putting pressure on the perineum.)
* We used a toy once and he started hitting that spot again, but he went too fast and I lost it. I couldn't really get that feeling back very strongly again after that.

Basically, I am just looking for a discussion / ideas / thoughts / etc. This guy is very special, and I understand his hangups. I just don't want them to end up causing a problem for us. 

I considered posting this in /r/sex, but I didn't think they would understand the trans aspect very well.

**tl;dr:** Please be ok with my openness about sex: A pre-op woman is having sex with her boyfriend, but she hasn't had an orgasm yet after several attempts.

I [posted a few weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1j07i5/questioning_mtf_long_brain_dump/) under a throw-away. Thought I might as well make a proper account... Short summary is that I think I'm probably a trans woman, I've been trying to work myself out, and you've all been a wonderful help so far!

Anyway... I know the answer is going to be ""it's different for everybody"", but what does dysphoria feel like?

I'm not sure if I've ever actually felt it, or if I just didn't notice it, or what. But I've been experimenting, and I think I might kind of be feeling something similar. Maybe?

A few days ago, I bought a bra. Slightly the wrong size, and I didn't really have anything to fill it with, so I just used socks. Then I put on the same top that, last time I wore it, had me crying in the corner about not having boobs. And I just felt right. It was incredible - I felt like *myself*, I felt calm, comfortable, relaxed, and happy - I think I was grinning like a maniac, just chilling out, painted my fingernails, listened to some music. I just felt great. Who'd have thought a bra, some socks, and some paint could make me feel so good.

Ended up going to sleep wearing the stuffed bra, and I just felt *so* comfortable. When I woke up, I was still feeling pretty euphoric, and I kind of felt like I really had breasts - the socks had warmed up, and it kind of just felt like they weren't there at all. All good, until I took the bra off.

I just felt really weird. Wrong, somehow. Like my chest wasn't where it was supposed to be. Pretty much the exact opposite of how I felt with the bra on. It just felt awkward.

I've made some really dodgy impromptu breast forms out of stuffed pantyhose legs, which are a lot better than the socks, and adjusted the bra a bit. I feel even better wearing those, and even worse after I take them off. They've got a sort of comforting weight to them, if that makes any sense.

But that weird, awkward feeling isn't exactly new. I think I've felt it before, but I never really knew what it was.

One other instance - the day after I bought the bra, I made an impromptu gaffe out of the rest of that pair of pantyhose, and tried tucking. Aside from the elastic being kind of awkward (it's in my butt crack, basically), and my testicles feeling a little bit uncomfortable, it's actually surprisingly comfortable. After a little while, as long as it doesn't move around, I kind of stop feeling my penis at all. It's not numb or anything, it doesn't hurt, and it's not painful after I un-tuck, but it's like I just can't feel it at all. My brain just seems to completely tune it out. Especially since I shaved everything - I could feel all the hairs rubbing against it before.

And that feels pretty good too. Kind of calming, actually. It's kind of like it had been screaming at me the whole time, and now it's suddenly quiet.

When I take that off, I can feel my penis again, moving around, brushing against things, and it's like all this extra sensory input that just feels awkward and uncomfortable. I definitely *have* felt that before. Pretty much since puberty, on and off, but especially over the past month or so. It's just never felt comfortable to me, but I always assumed that was just because it's an awkward dangly thing that keeps getting in the way.

So... yeah. It kind of feels like I'm only noticing how I've been feeling when I can get it to stop. It felt normal, as far as I was concerned, and it's like I only realized that it's not normal when, for just a little while, I couldn't feel it anymore.",,False,,t5_2r4b9,False,,,True,t3_1kgxam,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1kgxam/what_does_dysphoria_feel_like/,

I also think I have undiagnosed social anxiety disorder/social phobia, a lot of which revolves around me being trans. I remain undiagnosed because my family is dirt poor :/

I have a little sister who is 14, and she was recently diagnosed with asperger's syndrome, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and I don't even know what else. She is a pretty big mess.. she can't handle responsibilities like a normal 14 year old would be able to, she doesn't even bathe or brush her teeth regularly, and she can't clean up after herself and won't if you ask her or try to force her to through being grounded. My parents usually end up cleaning up after her..

Ever since I came out, she has occasionally said that she ""feels the same way"" except she wants to be a boy instead of a girl. I don't really know how to approach this because I really do not want to influence her one way or the other. She hangs around on tumblr a lot which I know has a strong FtM community, and I'm afraid that might have influenced her in some way. I also feel like *I* may have influenced her by coming out, because it wasn't until I did that she started saying she feels this way.

She is going to therapy and has talked to her therapist about this, and her therapist basically just told her that she's just confused, and that her other issues need to be worked on first.

To me, the #1 thing that makes me think she isn't transgender is the fact that she doesn't seem to have any dysphoria about her body, she even outright said she wouldn't want top or bottom surgery or even testosterone replacement. I know being non-op doesn't disqualify you, but she is young and I feel like she is simply confusing being tomboyish for being full blown FtM trans.

Now, the frustrating part for me is, my parents (who I still depend on - I can't work because of my social anxiety) are beginning to think that **I** am not transgender, or that I, too have asperger's (I highly doubt it) and that it somehow caused me to feel this way. My mom insists that because I played by myself with Lego in my room ""for hours on end"" that I must have asperger's like my sister does.. even though I don't have issues with understanding others, I'm just hypersensitive to the social environment so to speak.

So.. I guess my question is, what do I do with my sister? What do I tell my parents to get them to stop drawing these conclusions? I'm two and a half years into transition, I've been full time for half a year, and I feel so invalidated every time they try to make that argument..

My mom has been very unsupportive, and I told her that I've been on hrt for the past 4 months tonight. Aside from many other issues that I have with how that went, the main problem is that she just doesn't understand how devastating it can be to be trans and stuck.

At some point, I said that I did try to wait at her request, after coming out. I made it about 8 months. In that time, I got a place with my best friend, found a job, started getting into upper level classes that aren't 100% dull, etc. Aside from having the wrong physiology, life was fucking great. And I still was suicidal, despite everything I tried to do and everything good around me. I was stuck, and the dysphoria seemed to get worse every day. When I started, I was literally at a point were I had to start DIYing to keep from killing myself. She responded with, ""drama queen,"" and, ""you're weak.""

On the contrary, I said that I've never been happier, since the hormones started kicking in. I've loved every single effect they've had, aside from having to pee a lot due to spiro haha. I've experienced happiness and wholeness that I didn't know was possible... That continues to surprise me. I feel like I've gone from living an empty, worthless shell of an existence to a rich, fulfilling LIFE. I fucking feel alive. And, of course, she disregarded it all... Aside from trying to say that I'm immature, comparing me to a kid that sees a better videogame system than the one they have, and then HAS to have it or they'll throw a hissy fit. (A mature person would disregard dysphoria and depression until every aspect of life is in perfect order as a self-sufficient adult, and until there's a 0% chance that anyone they know could be negatively affected in any way.)

What the fuck do I do? It's not like I'm gonna stop my transition, since I'd have to be totally insane to do that.

I just told my therapist that I've always wanted to be a woman,  and that I've ordered and started taking hormones. I wouldn't even have admitted it except that I knew things were getting pretty weird if I'd gotten to the point where I started taking drugs. 

Here's the thing. He asked whether I wanted to be trans. Of course I don't. I want to be a woman. But I'd just as equally want to be comfortable in my current body, if I could change my mind. Well, he seems to think that there might be some way of redirecting these desires so that I don't go down the trans path. He claims that he once helped a gay person who wasn't comfortable with his sexuality to change sexual orientations. He also wants me to stop taking the hormones immediately, and to measure my testosterone levels ""as soon as they come back up"" ( how long is that with a couple weeks on hormones? ).

So. Is this a thing? Is it possible to have these urges but to redirect them with psychotherapy? I know brains are pretty plastic but as far as I know shaping gender and sexuality through psychotherapy alone is pretty experimental. I've met some people who claim that sexuality can be plastic, but my suspicion is that these people were already bi and had the freedom to push themselves one way or another. 

But yeah, I'm fucked. I really, really, really don't want to be transgender, but obviously things are getting unstable and I'm having trouble stopping myself from taking hormones. 

More details : 

It's very weird actually. This therapist is non-religious but has radical beliefs on the power of psychotherapy. They do not try to 'convert' all patients, but will be a sounding board if a patent expressed desire for this. Plus, it would be a complete fucking disaster if I'm not trans and get sucked in to thinking I am -- I will at least hear their possible explanations.  I do plan on talking it over a bit more with this therapist to see what justifications they might have for their beliefs, but I'll be lurking here for second opinions so I don't do anything stupid. 

As someone who has studied neuroscience a bit, I actually do believe that changing one's mental gender or sexualtiy will be possible one day. Just give me 100 years and unlimited funding so that I can figure out how to use deep brain stimulation to electrically reconfigure the limbic system. It's seriously complex though -- and not really possible yet or in any near future. But believe me, if I could change my brain, I'd *much* rather do that. 

Update: this is important : is there any other psychological thing that would progress to taking horomones that could be conflated with transsexuality, but implies a different course?

My girlfriends keep telling me that I'm either insane to be transitioning with what I'm dealing with or I'm just the most mentally strong person they have ever met. I hope its the latter haha.

Not to sound rude, but that must be among the hardest things I could imagine someone going through. Coming out as gay would be bad enough, depending on where you are, but wanting to change your sex? I can imagine it would be extremely isolating from family and friends (unless they're super supportive). I just have a hard time imagining how anyone could go through with it with their social sanity in tact?

As well, I'm curious about the details. Do most people have surgery to change genitalia? If say you're a male changing to female, would you find a female partner? Or male? Would that partner then either be a straight-but-bisexual female, or a gay male? I'm just wondering how the specifics and such work.

Finally, looking around here &amp; my personal experiences, I noticed almost exclusively males that want to be female  (as opposed to females wanting to be male) - what's up with that? Statistically, are there far more males wishing to change?

Thanks all, and I apologize if I sound ignorant or offensive - just trying to understand is all

1353995957.0,22,self.asktransgender,13uzqs,"Why are so many people worried about ""confirmation bias?"" ",viviphilia,25,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/13uzqs/why_are_so_many_people_worried_about_confirmation/,"I'm not sure why confirmation bias is all of a sudden a big concern around here.

[According to the wikipedia entry:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)

&gt;Confirmation bias (also called confirmatory bias or myside bias) is a tendency of people to favor information that confirms their beliefs or hypotheses.[Note 1][1] People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs. For example, in reading about current political issues, **people usually prefer sources that affirm their existing attitudes.** They also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position.

My understanding of confirmation bias, is that it occurs when one believes specious evidence that affirms an existing belief, despite stronger evidence to the contrary. So it's when a person ignores facts in order to keep on believing what they believed in the past. 

When I first started questioning my gender, I was hoping that I was just a crazy guy, rather than being trans, because I was terrified at the idea of transition. In order to avoid selection bias, I decided to go to a random psychologist. I did no background check on the person, so I had no clue if they would affirm or deny my gender identity. I was hoping that they would confirm my existing attitude - that I was crazy,  male, and not trans. 

If he had told me that I was just a crazy guy, and I believed him, then I would have been guilty of confirmation bias, because he was affirming my existing attitude despite the evidence otherwise. 

When I went to see a gender specialist, he told me it was obvious that I was trans. That isn't what I wanted to hear, and I didn't want it to be true, but that's where all the evidence was pointing. 

When people come on to this forum questioning their gender, it's rare that anyone here affirms their existing attitude, that they are really their assigned gender. Instead, the comments around here usually consist of ""here is my related experience as a confirmed trans person, and here is how I handled a similar situation."" 

Even if responders said something straightforward like, ""that behavior you're describing implies you are trans,"" it would not be confirmation bias because most people don't want to be trans.  

Where is all this confirmation bias that people are so worried about?

I guess this isn't really much of a question, more of a rant/venting session. Ever since I came out to my parents last November, what started out as support from them has slowly decayed into doubt about my identity, and now, outright denial and cissexism. I've never had a very good relationship with my parents, they've always been overprotective in a very damaging way that has left me socially crippled and forced me to endure years of psychological abuse at the hands of ""experts"" during my ruined childhood. More recently, they convinced me a to see a so called ""trans* expert"" who turned out to be a lier, gatekeeper, and generally shitty human being, who delayed my transition by over six months and was apparently never going to give me hormones anyway, this drove me to the brink of suicide (here's a link to my post about this if anyones interested [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/umtz4/having_a_massive_gatekeeperrelated_clusterfuck/)).

So I started going to an IC clinic instead; I was excited and relieved to finally start hormones. Then I learned on my first visit that my parents had already been in contact with my doctor before I even saw her, and have been threatening to report her for prescribing hormones, because I am apparently ""mentally ill"" to them, they are trying to destroy the most important trans* clinic in town. 

Today, it reached a crescendo; I've suspected my dad, being the close minded libertarian piece of shit that he is, and also considering the fact that he has always been psychologically abusive toward me, has been the main source of most of my troubles; I was completely right. He viciously attacked me for not getting ""the help I need"", claimed that my past shitty endocrinologist and his psychiatrist crony thought I was ""anomalous"", ""mentally unstable"", and also brought up a bullshit past diagnosis of autism I received from a very dubious psychiatrist as a reason that I am just deluding myself into believing I am trans. He then went on to refer to the pride center which I have received so much help from as a ""laughing stock in the gay community"" (he's bi), which is completely ludicrous, and called the trans* community ""mostly mentally ill"" and started trying to cissplain to me about chromosomes and bunch of other pop science bullshit claiming that he believes in ""science"" (ignoring the fact that I actually have a better backing in science than he does) and that telling me that I was being misled ""crackpot hippy bullshit"". Both of my parents are apparently now trying t destroy the careers of my current endo and the therapist who wrote my letter for giving hormones to a ""delusional autistic"", I am about to be fired from my job because my dad works there and holds a lot of sway (but I'm quitting tomorrow anyway); to top it all off, they repeatedly insulted my appearance and claimed that the shitty psych who saw claimed ""I would never make it as a woman"" (this hurt me the most). I felt like everything was going so well, I've been DIYing hormones and feeling great (and will *hopefully* get a legit script tomorrow), I have an awesome girlfriend who's also trans*, all my friends are supportive and using my chosen name and pronouns, I recently started working for a transactivist non-profit; and now my life is in shambles; I don't think I really know what to even do at all, what if they really do somehow destroy the careers of my doctors?

So here's the situation. I'm in my late 20s, genetically, anatomically, and socially male. I've thought about being a girl since before puberty (probably 7-ish years old when the thought first occurred to me). After hitting puberty, I was only ever aroused by thoughts/fantasies that involved being a girl. But I've also always stuck mostly to being ""manly"", or at least ""mannish"". I stick to exclusively male fashion and mannerisms. I'm too self-conscious to experiment with cross-dressing and the like, even in private for the most part. A few exceptions privately in my teens, and a couple socially-sanctioned cross-dressing events, but for those I was afraid of doing it too well and inadvertently revealing my enjoyment of it. One time I did it quite well with the exception of my raging facial hair (I seriously need to shave 2-3 times a day to avoid stubble), and everyone I knew called it ""scary"" or ""terrifying"". 

I'm also exclusively attracted to women. But that thing about being only aroused by fantasies of being female? My father pressured me into sex with prostitutes and it did *nothing* for me, I wasn't able to perform, because while I found them attractive, the act of putting my penis in them was ""meh"" at best.

Sounds like I'm obviously trans-something, right? But I have my doubts. Maybe I'm just a narcissistic straight guy who substitutes lesbian fantasies involving myself as a way of compensating for almost never having been intimate with someone, prostitutes I didn't want aside. (The one time I was, I was very drunk, but it was very enjoyable - and didn't involve my penis.) I know thinking about it so early would seem to argue against that, but it was after my mother had begun telling me that I was so awful I'd never have a relationship. And the fact that I don't want to be an ""ugly"" woman (which I would be if I went MtF) seems to argue for narcissism.

Besides, straight guys fapping to ""lesbian"" porn is so common it's a running joke. On the other hand, I feel like I react very differently to seeing lesbian couples than most straight guys. ""What a waste,"" a lot of those guys say, and it makes me want to either cry or punch them. Same reaction when they leer and ogle. For me, my heart fucking melts. I'm too caught up in ""aww"" and wishing I was one of them to even be aroused (remember the part about only being aroused by fantasies of being a woman).

For 27 years I've been shrugging off and ignoring things that have been taught to me as bad, negative, sin, what-have-you.

This is going to be a long story, so fasten your seat-belts and grab a soda/drink/whatever. I'm doing this because I'm so emotionally drained I can't sleep and I work an 11 hour a night job. I need to talk. 

As I said, 27 years. I've always experimented with make-up and clothing (there's way more too it than that though), mostly during my highschool years. There have always been clues all around me. I've always felt feminine but had always thought, ""eh, I dunno, whatever, right?""

I've never, ever been satisfied with how I look. I stand in the bathroom for ten-fifteen minutes messing with my hair when all I'm doing is going to a gas station for a pack of smokes.

A few years ago I scarred one of my eyes and can no longer wear contacts. I cannot stand glasses on my face.

I'm also an avid gamer. I think it aggravates my best friend to see me constantly playing a female character.

All of my ex-girlfriends were right, I am more of a woman than they were when I was with them.

And with parents who pretty much sit on the complete opposite side of the spectrum, you know, the one that would possibly get me excommunicated, I'm terrified. 

Here I am. About five years ago I confirmed that I am atheist. That didn't go over well.

A few weeks ago I had an explosive argument with my Dad, which simultaneously set off a group of alarms in my head and brought this to the surface. It literally emerged out of nowhere.

Since about four days ago, I am finally fully acknowledging the fact that, although I am a man on the outside, I know for a fact that this isn't what I am on the inside. I can feel it. I have always felt this. It was the teachings of my parents and schoolteachers and the ridicule of my peers which held this piece of me down, just hiding their behind a curtain, sort of waiting for it to go up.

Over the past three days I have been unable to get a good ""days"" sleep. I'm feeling dizzy. I'm excited. I'm happy as hell. I'm frustrated. I'm angry. My head hurts. I don't know what to do next. I'm scrambling to find *someone* I can talk to about this. I'm home from work and chain-smoking half bursting into tears and a fit of laughter, I don't know what's going on.

I'm scared.

I'm a writer too. I haven't been able to write anything since everything exploded.

If anyone here can say something. Provide a bit of solace for the moment, I would be incredibly thankful and indebted to you. My precursor to all of this was the posting of a transphobia ""update"" on my website, which I'll reference to in the future, most likely. I'm just sitting here wondering if the little clues I drop on social networks aren't obvious. Is this something I *want* everybody to know right away?

Seeing how transgender individuals have been stigmatized, attacked, and persecuted for expression of their gender has always been something that has pulled at my heartstrings.

With that said, I kissed a transgender boy tonight. He's gorgeous, kind, funny, and fun to be around. He really makes me smile, and he gave me butterflies for the first time in a really really long time. I'm leaving for college in the fall, and I told him that I would be leaving soon and I couldn't do long distance, and he understands that, but he still wants to pursue something for now. I believe he's had a mastectomy (I could be wrong) and I know he is five months+ into hormones. 

I'm going to be blunt and I apologize if any of this comes across as rude, but I'm unsure as to whether any surgery has been done on his genitals. Honestly, I'm not adverse to the idea of dating a guy with a vagina mentally, but I'm also afraid that I won't be sexually attracted to him if we were to attempt to have sex. What do I do if that happens? I mean, genitals don't seem like a big deal. I'm already attracted to him now, but I'm just afraid that if he has a vagina I won't be when we go to have sex.

Reading what I wrote, I feel like what I said sounds really shallow and possibly transphobic, but I promise that's not my intent at all. One more question I have is what does it look like if he has had surgery? I mean, I have some transwomen friends and their parts look like any cisgender parts I've seen, but I've never seen a transman's penis. I know there are a few different types of surgery, some that still have lots of sexual sensitivity but less aesthetics and some that don't but are more aesthetic. I guess I'm just curious what it might look like. Maybe photos would be appreciated? This is more out of curiousity than anything else.

Anyway, I guess I could use any advice about how to approach this situation. I'm assuming I should approach this like any other relationship, but I want to make sure I'm doing this right. I don't know, I guess this sounds silly, but I really could use any words any of you could offer about what I can expect. Thank you in advance!

Ever since I was about the age of 13, I wanted to be a girl. I was a Christian back then so I wished and prayed every night, and it never happened. I would sneak clothes from my sister's room or my grandmother's old costume trunk and wear them at night. I'd stuff bras and wear them when I was all alone at home. It was hard to live that way, though, and I closeted that aspect of me up until a few years ago.

Besides that, I pretended to be a girl online, I would look at women both for attraction reasons and jealousy, every game that allowed the choice, I would take the female option. I had no problem playing or roleplaying females in table top games. Any dream where I was me, I was a female.

Now, at 28, I'm fully aware of my transgender nature. I want to approach this now, before I start to want to get in a long-term relationship... but it scares me to death. I can't even go talk to a therapist because I'm so afraid of it. I live in Virginia, where it's basically legal to kick my ass or throw me out of the apartment I live in. Fortunately I can't be fired, but it's not like my life will remain easy at work. My family, I'm almost 90% sure will abandon me because they're still all fundamentalist Christians.

**tl;dr: 24 straight male cd, feels like cd is a shadow of something I want permanently**

So Im just rounding out 24 and have always been a pretty straightforward (emphasis on straight) guy.  I've had a crossdressing hobby since I was quite young (which started out with a pretty extreme desire for God to magically make me into a girl) and have in the last 6 months for the first time come to terms with it.  I'm on my own and have my own funding and can actually shop for things and don;t have to hide, I've even ""come out"" to my roommate and a few close female friends, one of which is an ex.  I've really developed this side of me, and it goes past just dressing it, it comes all the way down to wanting to pass and be seen as a girl.

I've been rationalizing it in my head, that it's just this other side of me...I dont act or think differently, it;s just me in a different body.  And I don;t by any means hate the male me, he dresses nice, looks sharp, and is generally (form what I hear) a pleasure to be around.  I like women and frankly tend to not understand how they think much at all.

But it's starting to feel like the more I dress up, the more I wish that that was who I really was, instead of just a fantasy.  I went out in public for the first time a few weeks ago (can check my submitted links if interested) and, although it was exciting, it left me with this severe feeling of loneliness.  I was out there but I wasn't real....I was just pretending (and I dont have a girl voice so i didnt want to try going into anywhere or talk to anyone)

Since then, dressing just kind of holds this shadow over me of being a fantasy of something that can never be.

And so I;ve had this itch in my head that is always bolstered by browsing this sub about transitioning.  The whole thing is far too terrifying for me to even consider but (and I know this is probably a terrible reason) my curiosity is driving me mad.  I just keep thinking ""Could I actually do that?  Would it actually make a difference??""

I'm currently in therapy but it's for depression and anxiety and the genderbending has yet to come up.  I know speaking with a professional is always the best bet but I;m hoping that maybe the wonderful people here can offer some advice, guidance, or at the very least tell me Im being stupid so I can continue doing what Im doing with making a mistake.

This is long and ranty so I apologize in advance. I am a cis girl who has been dating a mtf for five years now. I'm in love and I'm happy to say that she is too. We live in southern town but have found welcoming work and friends. She has come out to a small group of her family that are supportive but is sure the rest won't be. I told my parents (who all my life taught me to be open and tolerant to everyone) and they seemed ok with it all. Then later my mother came to me crying about how she was worried that we will be discriminated against and just generally unsafe with the heated climate towards these things in the U.S. We talked about it and she seemed ok for a while again. Now she wants me to leave my girlfriend because no one else in our family or her circle of friends would approve. She also once had a trans best friend when she was young who later felt that he was actually gay so she is also worried the same thing will happen to my girlfriend and I'll be left in the dust. The totally rejected and betrayed dust. She says that it is my decision and not hers but I don't feel like it is when she shouts about how only her and my father will still love me if I tell the rest of my family. I asked my mother tonight about her feelings of moving in with my girlfriend and I got another mouth full. I feel like I can't fight back because she is my mother and I was downsized out of a job and need help with my bills. She says that she won't completely support the relationship until I try dating some more because my girlfriend is my first love. I confessed to dating a girl before (in secret, for fear of her reaction in high school) and she dismissed it. I have identified myself as pansexual since I knew what it meant but mostly stuck with men because it was easy to explain and deal with. Reddit, this is the first person I really clicked with. I can't imagine dating someone else when I feel the way I do about my girlfriend. I could go on and on about her laugh that just melts me, the way she walks in her heels, how she intellectually challenges me (in a good way), and more! Reddit, my girlfriend and I are so happy together! Of course we have our ups and downs but overall more ups and we would like this to last. We sometimes talk about how she is worried that I'll want things from her that she can't give but so far I'm ok with what we have. I ask the same and she assures me that I'm what she wants. I think that I can handle whatever intolerance comes my way with jobs and finding friends (and oddly enough my mother agrees with that). My only concern is my family. The thing is before this all happened I was wondering about my contact levels with them. As in they are crazy Christian-republican-Obama-is-a-muslim-racists and I did not know what my relationship would be to them. I always assumed I'd keep it to a minimum because you can't pick family, right? Now that I'm really considering loosing them I feel guilty. Not guilty enough to leave my girlfriend. We have tried taking breaks over this but we can't stay apart for very long. 

/Asktransgender, I am confused and hurt and I don't know what to do. I'm not suicidal but a lot of the time I feel drained from thinking my problems over while giving support to my girlfriend as well. I was hoping to hear advice from others who have been there; done that. 

Also some tips on how to make my girlfriend feel better when she sometimes gets down in the dumps about her perceived slow transitional development? I think she is beautiful and wonderful and tell her so sprinkled with home cooked food and flowers and cuddles.

EDIT FOR UPDATE: I tried talking to my mom some more and it was the same ole' same ole'. You guys raised some points that I didn't think of so will file in my brain for the later heart to hearts that will come. She has only known about my girlfriend for a few months so I'm just going to hope that time and talks will help her. 

On a side note, I went to a wine bar with my girlfriend last night. We had a wonderful time. I got a little tipsy and when most of the people we knew left I spent my inebriation giving her compliments in weird voices (I make a mean Old Greg and Pikachu). I think she got embarrassed so I stopped but when her cocktail number caught up with mine she asked for an encore so SUCCESS!

So after not talking for probably six months, she started talking to me again last week. She didn't know anything about me transitioning, but I'm in the process of coming out to my friends (already came out to family) and I decided to tell her the truth.

She responded SO well. She's always been a huge LGBT advocate, but she was elated about me being trans. It was really unexpected. She's super excited at the prospect of having a girl friend that she can help out with transitioning and stuff. It's more than that though, she admitted to me that she has an attraction to transsexuals, that knowing that I'm trans made me more attractive in her eyes, especially after she saw pictures of me as a girl.

I have been 
full-time for a while now, and like to think I pass pretty well. I have a wonderful, loving 
relationship with another woman around my age, whom I currently reside with. We spend almost all of 
the time I am not dealing with college classes or work together, we have many interests in common, 
and she just generally makes me extremely happy. However, the one issue we have is sex.
When I was younger and discovered masturbation, it took me a while to realize that 
something was not quite right. I had a very active libido then, and still do mostly, despite 
hormones, although lessened somewhat. With the wonders of the internet open to me (when my mother 
was not at home), I did what you might expect. The thing was, no matter what I did, I could not 
orgasm. There was a certain amount of pleasure in getting myself excited, and I had no problems 
being able to ejaculate, but I did it in complete silence, with no accompanying rush of pleasure 
like I had read everyone felt. I still did it, but mostly because it removed the urge, at least for 
a while.

I had several girlfriends (pre-transition), before meeting my current one about the time 
that I began transitioning. She was the first person I ever had sex with, and I enjoyed it: but 
still no orgasm. Our relationship has continued until now with virtually no problems (and a great 
deal of support for my transition from her), but over time, I grew decreasingly interested in 
having sex with her, because every time going in to it I knew that I would end up disappointed. 
Even the physical side of orgasm I only achieved a few times. I mostly kept doing it to make her 
happy; she tried (and still does) as much as she could to make it enjoyable for me.
She is fully a lesbian, having no interest in men, but I leaned bisexual, despite having no 
experience outside of women (and sexually speaking, besides her). As a couple of atheists with a 
durable relationship, neither of us had any problem with polyamory, so I set out to find someone 
else to meet up with who might be able to satisfy me. I did not then (and still do not) know why I 
had the trouble I did: I could think of a number of possibilities, but my lack of variety of 
experience (many forms of sex are impossible for us due to her above-average sensitivity) left me 
with few answers.

Finally, after several tries, I met someone who lived near us through the internet. We met 
(with her with me for safety), and he seemed as nice as he did online, so we agreed to set a future 
date to try things out sexually together. Although he had no experience with trans girls, he was no 
bigoted about it, and willing to give it a try. 

So, yesterday, I thoroughly made sure I looked my best, even ordering a couple cute-looking 
items off of the internet to complete my outfit. In the evening, my girlfriend dropped me off at 
the agreed-upon place, and a little later, he showed up and, after sharing a drink at a local bar, 
got a room at a bed-and-breakfast. He brought his backpack full of toys, and after some foreplay 
(and my first kiss with a boy; I liked it), clothes came off. There was some manual and oral 
stimulation, but as I was massaging his back and shoulders, he informed me that he was sorry, but 
he just could not get into it. Further questioning yielded that although he thought it would not be 
a problem for him, me being trans (and still cursed with the same appendage I was born with) made 
it too difficult for him to enjoy it. So, I told him that although it disappointed me, I could not 
blame him for his preferences as long as he was not bigoted about them (which he was not), and, 
after calling my girlfriend to come pick me up, he walked me back to the pick-up spot and we hugged 
goodbye. I managed to hold off on crying until the car ride back home.

So, in the end, things could have gone much worse; I have heard enough stories of terrible 
things happening to trans people in similar situations. Still, it made me feel ugly, and took away 
my chance (for now) to enjoy sex; I still have the creeping suspicion that I am simply incapable of it. I

Last night I told them a story about a monster chasing a boy home, then going away once the boy hid under the blankets on his bed. My son, T, retold the story afterwards:

""Once upon a time there was a pretty princess boy named T, and he was walking through the woods.""

When he was done with the story, he said ""I wish I could be a princess.""

I said ""Well, what stops you from being a princess?""

""Only princesses are girls,"" he said. ""I'm not a girl so I can't be a princess. I could wear a princess dress, though. Does [his little sister] have any princess dresses I could wear?""

""She has a few of them,"" I said, ""and you can wear them, but they might be a bit small on you.""

He said ""Yay!"" followed by, in a sad voice, ""I wish I was a girl.""

He has said this exact phrase - ""I wish I was a girl"" - pretty much since he learned to talk, but this was the first time I heard it in such a forlorn tone.

I didn't really know what to say to him. I thought about telling him there are princes, too, and they can dress up just as nicely as princesses, but I don't think that would help and I'm concerned that it's impressing a gender role onto him.

For context, he is an enthusiastic, bright little boy with long curly dark hair. He loves having long hair, tells us how beautiful his hair is, and enjoys picking out different outfits to wear. He likes singing and dancing, telling jokes, and he's extremely affectionate. He's frequently mistaken for a girl when we're out in public, which his older brother finds funny, and his dad finds offensive.

I'd like some suggestions on how to talk with him about this, whether it's even appropriate to address it at this age, and what experience any of you have had in a similar situation.

A little background:  I'm in my late 20s now but I've had an interest in crossdressing since I was probably 12.  I used to go through my mom's things and later my sister's things.  At that point, it wasn't to get off because I hadn't even discovered masturbation, but I got a rush from and enjoyed wearing female clothing.  When I went away to college, I would crossdress as much as I could with roommates, although sometimes after I would masturbate, I would lose the passion and change back.  Soemtimes, however, I would wear female clothes all night.  

Now that I'm older and living on my own, my ability to dress as I please without getting caught has made me interested in dressing more frequently and also more casually as a female (by casually, I mean less sexy clothes and more common, practical, day to day stuff.)  I'm considering getting a wig and breast inserts to complete my look.  I have the summer off and I'm thinking that I'll try dressing full time but only at home.  

Other things about me:  I am straight.  I don't find myself at all sexually attracted to men.  I do, however, fantasize about being a female and having sex as a female.  


My main question is: How do I know if I just enjoy crossdressing as a fetish or showing transgender tendencies that might make me more happy as a female?

As a more practical question, if I do decide to dress on a day to day basis as a female, how to I get the clothes and other accessories that I'll need?  I would feel too embarrased to just go into a store or even a thrift shop and get clothes that way.  

Any help, insight, advice would be great.  Don't worry about questions being too blunt or delicate to ask.

I am the gay brother--interesting combination, right?  FYI we're both 17, if that adds a bit of insight into why I may be asking some of these questions.  Anyways, I'm a bit out of touch with the transgender community as evident in asking my sister about hot gay guys.  In many ways I find it a bit hard to call her my ""sister"" because I see her as my ""brother"" in many ways (she came out last year and after 16 years it's been a bit of a hard transition for me to make, albeit one I am committed to).  In seeing her as my ""brother"" I didn't really connect the dots that she would be attracted to straight guys and not gay guys.  It was embarrassing to say the very least.

Part of my problem is that I don't really understand what it's like.  My sister has never really been very feminine and girly (and yes I know everyone fits into their own box and can't be grouped into either one concrete box or the other) and she never really fit in anywhere.  I know adolescence is a very confusing time for a lot of people--I only found out that I might be gay a little over six months ago, and even then I may still be confused, even though I'm REALLY sure I'm not.  I guess what I'm trying to say is since she never really fit in with all the other groups of guys at school maybe she seeks acceptance among other girls--I've known her a long time and it seems like she may just be confused.  Don't get me wrong, gay or straight, I will always support the rights of every LGBTQ individual and would NEVER EVER do anything to intentionally harm or undermine any individual in any of these groups, but sometimes I just don't know if she's confused--she never really had a strong group of friends and was constantly having trouble being accepted--maybe a girl could find more acceptance, at least in her mind?

I love my sister regardless of sex, sexual orientation, or gender, and will always want only the best for her.  I have no problem against accepting her as she is but I guess it's sort of a hard thing for me to want my sister, who for a long time has been my ""brother,"" to be a woman since it would mean she would have to go through a harder life.  It doesn't help that so much transphobia is prevalent in our society, even in some of the most liberal towns of the northeast US (which is where we live).

Please help me understand and not hate me for asking these questions:

1. What's your story?  How did you discover who you are and how did you innately know? (Yes I know it's like something you *always* know but when was your moment of self-awareness--at least for me I had that ""holy crap, I'm sexually and romantically attracted to guys"" which, upon further thought, became ""haha no kidding!"")

2. Did you ever question or resist it yourself?

3. How did your parents (and siblings) take it?  (Our parents are currently also on the fence--I talked with them about it and they expressed the same concerns)

4. What can I do to better improve my sister's life and show my unconditional love?

I have know her for about 3 years now. Over the years I have seen her come out and supported her through her transition but recently I am a little worried about the things she has been posting on facebook. 
Her posts went from regular statuses to only posting about transphobic issues and rants about cis people. In example, ""I would watch *insert popular tv show here* but it has this one transphobic scene in it so that show is awful"" or "" The LGBT community is so transphobic who cares about gay marriage??"" 

Anyone who posts a different opinion ie:""Gay marriage is actually a pretty big step for us and a good sign of change"" is personally attacking her and her trans friends and she removes them from her friends list. The differing opinion is not met with ""I understand what you are saying but I disagree with you and here's why""  instead her and her friends post "" DON'T TELL ME HOW TO BE OPPRESSED.""  

She has been deleting cis friends left and right for differing opinions and posts about it every time "" Welp, that's another cis person out of my life"" and then writes a post about how alone she is. This whole thing has really been bothering me. These are friends who knew her before the transition and loved and supported her for years during the transition and still love and support her. But now she won't even speak to them because they have a different opinion on something.  Either you agree with her or at the very least you do what I do and don't post that you disagree, because god help you if you do. 

It really hurts me to hear her rant and post about how all cis people are transphobic assholes and to see her other trans friends post the same. She sounds exactly like the people she is ranting about. A few have tried to call her out on it but that just turned into a huge wasteland of petty insults and anger.

I may be cis but I am a person first and I am her friend. I do not like being generalized like that and I think that is very unfair to speak about so many people who love and support you like that.


anyways, I have kept my mouth shut about it for a while and tried to block her posts but some still pop up. I really feel I should say something to her and let her know ""hey, you are hurting and excluding people who love and support you."" But I don't think I can find the right words. 

I know some of you may be thinking I am over exaggerating but please believe me when I say I am not. 

As a native woman I post about native issues from time to time but that is not the only content I post. I do not rant about how shitty white people are because 90% of my friends are white and I have no anger against them even if they do not understand the issues I am talking about. People will have differing opinions from time to time but I do not think that is a reason to disown them. 


TL;DR : My friend rants about cis people and deletes cis friends off facebook  and cuts off contact with them if they do not agree with her. As a cis person it makes me uncomfortable but I do not know how to talk to her about it.

i've felt like a girl since i was like six, but not constantly: it shifts throughout any given day. at night i feel more private, and my feminine side comes out; i dress up, i've been trying to experiment with makeup, doing things to be more comfortable with that part of me. i hope that eventually i will be able to come out to more than just my close friends and S/O, but that seems so far off...telling my parents just seems insane.

i guess i just don't feel authentic because i dont have a particular ""thing"" that i am, i dont have a label. which is good, in an abstract way, but makes me feel really insecure. i mean, how can i ""come out"" if i have nothing to come towards, no single identity group to go into?

if someone were to hypothetically come up and ask me ""what gender/sexuality are you"", i don't have a consistent answer. i'm not a man and i'm not a woman, i don't belong in either category and that's just kind of how it is. does anyone else on here feel that way too?",,False,,t5_2r4b9,False,,,True,t3_1da5ae,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1da5ae/is_it_okay_to_not_want_hormone_treatment/,

About 6 months ago I met a transgendered girl and we started dating.  She is really pretty and I am really attracted to her, however lately we fight all the time and the more I am with her the more I find we have very little in common.      

Normally I would just say, ""sorry it isn't working"" and go on my way, but with her it is really hard.   It is harder because I am her first real boyfriend, she had one previous relationship when she first started to transition and he left her because he couldn't handle it.  Then she tried dating and got rejected time after time, and for over two years she was single.  When she found me, she was so excited to date a guy that excepted her, she has fallen head over heals for me and puts a lot of pressure on me to be with her every day non stop.   We mostly fight because I am an engineering student and have to spend large amounts of time working on my work, so she gets really upset if I don't text her back right away.   I like her, but we also have a large age difference, almost 8 years, which also makes it really hard to relate to her.   I have tried to break up with her in the past, and she begs me to stay with her.  Also she tells me that she has considered suicide in the past, and it worries me that she might not be able to handle a break up.   The other problem is her family has completely disowned her for transitioning and so I am one of the only people she can talk to since none of her coworkers or friends know she is transgendered.  


So how do I break up with her?  She is convinced that if she becomes single again that she will never find a normal guy..  Do you have any advise?   I also don't want her to think it has anything to do with her being transgendered, it has absolutely ZERO impact on my decision to break up with her.  I want to be her friend, but I just know there are better people out there for both of us! Thanks for any advise!

I am being told I'm wrong on this one, so I'd like to be educated. The person I was debating with refuses to explain and says this sub was created to educate on this kind of thing so here I am.

For my example I'm going to use Bob, a straight man (cis or trans, shouldn't matter for this discussion I think, but let me know if I'm wrong), and Cheryl, a trans woman that has not yet undergone sexual reassignment surgery.

Bob and Cheryl meet at a bar. They talk, get along, decide to go back to Cheryl's place and hook up. When they get to Cheryls and clothes come off Bob sees Cheryl has a penis. He says ""Oh, sorry, but I'm not attracted to penises. I want to have vaginal sex."" and leaves.

I've been told what Bob did is transphobic, and I don't understand how that's the case. He's not rejecting Cheryl for being trans*, he's rejecting her because she does not have the genitals he is attracted to, and they can't have the sexual interaction he prefers.

So... what am I missing?

Thanks. Also, sorry about the offensive username, it's an alt account. Don't like having polarizing debates following me with red envelopes when I am just wanting to have a carefree look at cats and cableporn.

Born a boy, think girlish most of the time. Not enough impact on my daily life to seriously consider transition. Counsellour said it's a mild case and as long as I'm happy, I can live with it.

I work in an office area with tons of food places around. So I'd call ahead my order, usually for one or more coworkers, and go pick it up. 

This happened to me today. It's not the first time, and not the same restaurant either.

Me: I'm here for pickup
Her: did you order yet?
Me: yes, two orders of chicken, appetizer A and...
Her: appetizer B, right?
Me: Yes.
Her: A girl called to order, right?
Me: er...
Her: you came to pick up for her, right? Are you sure it's your order? 

I don't even know what to do at this point. Usually during the day I'm in boy mode, but I've had dreams where I'm in girl mode picking up food or going to work... I always look down to make sure I am wearing the right clothes from the right closet, and sometimes it turns into a nightmare like omg she knows she knows and she's going to call the cops as soon as she takes my money, etc etc

So I stared at her. Looked down. Boy mode work clothes. Looked back at her. Dreading whether I should explain it or not. ""Oh yeah I just sound like a girl hahaha"" or get mad ""couldn't you even tell?!"" 

I ended up just nodding and paying for my food and leaving.

After a while it's been a little easier to read myself female, but I'm still surprised by my real life avatar when I encounter reflective objects.

Since the reality of the upcoming transition is finally hitting me, it has caused my internal dialogue to focus on double-checking any uncertainties I may have had. So I have a few questions here. Sorry if this is a bit of a mess; I'm in an anxious state right now.

The main thing that worries me is my self-analytic nature. I view everything through a critical lens and challenge anything resembling a core belief that I might have. Up until coming out to myself as trans, this quality is something that I've always taken pride in. Now it just drives me insane. I've yet to logically validate my gender identity to myself (even though I, of course, have not invalidated it either). 

I've read plenty of responses on this subreddit that emphasize letting go and being happy instead of constantly torturing oneself with thoughts of validation. The problem is, the idea of ignoring a difficult thought for the sake of happiness is at odds with one of my few core values (seeking out the truth, however uncomfortable it might be). Considering this, will my life post-transition likely be filled with anxiety?

Please understand that this self-analysis is never externalized. I have no difficulty respecting the identities of other trans people. I'm just exceptionally hard on myself. Also, when I talk about validating my gender identity, I don't mean that I see cisgender identity as inherently valid. It's more that I wonder if gender should be an issue to me at all. 

What if I could make myself ignore the concept of gender altogether? The thought of being a sort of genderless consciousness appeals to me, even though I have severe dysphoria on a daily basis and pretty much obsess about transitioning. 

I'm afraid of never being comfortable with myself in the future. I can imagine constantly reassessing my decision to transition and doubting whether or not it was the right thing to do. Then again, I'm never comfortable with myself in my current state either. 

**tl;dr:** I'm a very analytic person and worry about never being able to feel secure in my identity and choices. My strong emotions and painful dysphoria are at odds with my logical train of thought that leans towards the idea that gender identity should not be an issue to me.

Obviously this is a throwaway, and I want to provide a disclaimer from the beginning: If anything I say offends anyone, I wholeheartedly apologize. I'm not use to using different pronouns, so please bare with me.


I don't have many places to turn to for advice, and the issues I've been dealing with are starting to greatly impact my studies, so I'm looking to you for a little advice.


A couple months ago my SO of almost seven years came out to me that they are transgender, and it's been something that's been extremely difficult to handle. If it were any other circumstances, if we were only friends or whatever, there wouldn't be an issue. I'd be there to support them no questions asked.


My issue is this: I'm a heterosexual male, and I know this is going to sound terrible but before all of this I found her absolutely gorgeous, even thinking about it has me tearing up as I'm writing. I still love them to death but I'm struggling with everything going on, not because I'm prejudiced in any way, but because I'm not attracted to male attributes? If that's a PC way to say it.


I was very against it at first, mostly because I was scared of it meant, but I've started to come around and be more comfortable as much as possible. But recently the topic of HRT has come up more and more, and I'm not sure if that's something that I can handle personally. I'm having a constant internal struggle because I want to support them but I also still want the physical attraction to be there (I know that sounds terribly shallow and selfish but it's the truth).


Another thing that is hard for me, is that when all of it started to initially come to light, they told me that they were going to start binding and things like that as an experiment to see how it made them felt, but it quickly started escalating with no consideration to how the actions impacted me. Like cutting all of their hair off, things like that.


So I guess, if anyone has had any kind of experience with things like this, or knows of any resources that might help, feel free to let me know. I've been in a terrible depression, I can't even remember if I attended class this week.

But always, in the back of my mind, there's a little smidgeon of doubt that tells me ""You can't be non-cis, you lived as male for years...your body isn't right, your face is too male, look at you...there are times you still feel male, right? That means you're a fraud, a sham...one day you'll wake up and feel 100% cis because you're lying to yourself..."" And I hate that voice. I hate those thoughts. I hate feeling male. I'll admit, there are times that I lose sight of who I want to be and feel like who I (used) to be. And I hate it, feeling male and doing those things. It's exacerbated by the fact that my employment is not a place I would feel comfortable or safe being out about my gender, so every day I hear people calling me ""he"" or using my birth name, which I no longer prefer. It's especially bad because in my work clothes, I feel like a person who I'm not, a person forced to exist in a body I hate.
Not to mention that I've been dealing with some other, semi-unrelated psychological issues. Combined, though--it almost tears me apart at times. And my family is...not a group I want to turn to. That ship has sailed.
I want to ask other non-cis Redditors: is that awful doubt normal? Does anyone else experience that? Did anyone else have worry that they were pretending or faking the person they wanted to be? Does this make me a fraud or a sham or a bad person? I just really need help dealing with this.

I'm a gay trans man in my 30's. I transitioned many years ago, started in my teens. I have never dated or attempted to date anyone. 

Adolescent peers considered me a disturbed and repulsive female pretending to be a man. I also got regular familial lectures on how if I transitioned, I would be a half-man subeunuch whom no one but perverts would want. This wasn't meant as hyperbole, it was quite literal; transition meant accepting either celibacy or life as a degraded novelty fuck.

In college a few people expressed interest, but only women and I could never really believe they wanted anything besides the aforementioned novelty fuck. Which was at least partially me projecting, but I couldn't stop. Even if I could, physical dysphoria makes interaction with the affected regions unbearable. I've never been past 1st base, and the couple times I tried were pretty awful. Couldn't think of anything but the panicked need to escape. Made an ass of myself, couldn't even look at them afterwards, ruined some good friendships. After that attempting a sex life seemed impossible/pointless, so I didn't.

And that's where I've been for over a decade. I'm semi-stealth, have a good life and job and friends, I don't break any mirrors and I've had top surgery. A lot of friends assume I'm asexual, but I'm so desperately frustrated I can't stand it. I'm also not getting any younger and I don't want to be alone forever.

How the holy fuck do I break out of this? I've set up an OKCupid profile, and I'm only going to message/respond to messages from guys who answered *Yes* to both *""would you date a trans person""* and *""would you date someone who hasn't been in a relationship before.""* Past that I have no idea what to do. I don't even know what people do on dates, my only knowledge of them comes from TV and I'm guessing that isn't particularly accurate.

I'm a developmentally stunted lifelong celibate eunuch and the humiliation of this is paralyzing. I'm afraid it's too late, I've waited too long and have too little to offer, that no sane person would voluntarily settle for someone so fucked up. I'm afraid even if someone does want me it'll be a repeat of college, in which I humiliate myself and insult them.

I've always been drawn to the beauty of women, be it their appearance, their clothing, cute mannerisms, everything. I've cross-dressed more than a few times, sporadically, but never felt comfortable, just fake, like I would see my masculine bits and I would just feel worse, even if I liked how the clothes felt on me.

Some time in my late high school career, I finally ran into someone online who identified as trans* to some degree. I recognized that there were desires within me to look more feminine, but I could not accept myself as transgender because I thought I didn't ""fit the mold"": I didn't act girly, I did all kinds of stereotypical ""boy"" stuff, I was sexually attracted to women, I thought I didn't really hate my penis since I masturbated often... Take all that, and combine it with the miniscule amount of info that I gleaned about transgenderism- its limits, the difficulties of transition, the stigma that society places on people who are different, religious stigma, I even feared my own parents' reactions (super-Catholic) so much that I don't think I ever mentioned my feelings to ANYONE.

I have this memory of lying in my bed one night, basically telling myself over and over to essentially ""man up,"" because that is who I am, and I should be happy and grateful for the gifts that I have, rather than focus on what I have not.  So, yeah, as most of you can guess, that didn't exactly work. All it did was turn me into a soulless prick who did everything he could to separate himself from anything even remotely feminine- I avoided making girl friends, I kept up with my sports, took up stereotypically masculine hobbies (cigars, guns, etc.), and basically focused on high school and later my college schoolwork. I majored in engineering, a discipline roughly 95% male in my particular class, and difficult enough that I had almost zero time to socialize or think about other things like my gender. 

I continued my introverted ways so blindly that I didn't have a core group of friends in college until halfway through my sophomore year. I just played video games, read, and masturbated frequently. My anxiety over my gender manifested in other ways- I got sexually obsessed over pictures and stories of men turning into women (often forced, through magical or fictional means). It was the fantasy that I found so thrilling, although I always preferred at least a picture to ""help things along."" Somehow, I justified this as just being a ""kink"" that I had, so no big deal if I never told anyone and continued living as a male.  I developed some bad habits of avoidance and procrastination- putting things out of mind if they seemed too difficult to deal with- which often resulted in obligations and other things creeping up and surprising me at the last minute. I failed a couple classes, but I perservered and still graduated on time. I still consider my B.S. to be one of my biggest accomplishments that I can hang my hat on.

Now, I am approaching my third year since graduating college. I am in a semi-stable position at a sales company, living on my own (with one roommate), and horribly depressed. I never had any long-term plans after college- career, relationships, all I got in my head was ""get a job, and take it from there.""

At first I thought my depression was due to my inability to land the coveted high-paying engineering position, or because I smoked ganja almost everyday, or because I still only could maintain half a dozen friends with a tremendous amount of effort, or because I only date women once every blue moon, or because I wasn't in good physical shape. Yet, I would look at women and feel emotions that I still couldn't rightly identify. Was I just attracted to women, was I attracted to MEN who transformed into women, or did I actually find the thought of MYSELF as a women attractive? I was too afraid to really explore this any deeper than I already had. I had been teased enough as a child for being different... I didn't want to deal with that again as an ADULT.

Within the past few months, however, things finally started to click for me. I stumbled across a few sites dedicated to real transgender folks, and I saw the realities of this particular community. I saw transition timelines, read what HRT can actually do, even for adult males, and I realized that this might just be who I am. It didn't matter that I wasn't interested in men exclusively, or that I didn't dress feminine (although I do have a decent fashion sense for being born male), or that I masturbated and didn't hate my penis with a fiery passion. What mattered was how I want to live my life. 

I knew my current situation was untenable, but I also knew that therapy in my current state would be slow and meticulous if I wasn't taking care of my person. I made a pact. If I was serious about finding out about myself, I needed to get serious. I stopped the heavy cannabis use (down to a few times a week, or even just stopping for long periods of time), since there just wasn't a deep need for it anymore, since it did nothing to relieve the dysphoria that was becoming more and more pronounced the further I began to explore. I started eating healthier and working out- every other day, 20-35 minute run, no upper body training (I never had a desire to have a strong upper body, that much I could admit to myself). 

I also tried a few small steps in the female direction- small enough steps that no one would notice but me. I started using a moisturizer for my skin, started exfoliating my face properly, started growing out my hair beyond the usual buzzcut, and even removed my body hair (Nair was painless- I followed the directions, and when the hair started falling off, I just couldn't stop smiling).

I've had my first appointment with the endo for my blood test, and my first session with my gender therapist is within a week or two (informed consent clinic). The intake personnel have all been encouraging, but I am starting to lose it mentally.

As I reflect on my past and my VERY recent history, my biggest issue remains- HOW can I trust myself after having spent so much time lying to my own self? I took enough philosophy to understand the basic tenant that all we have are our own observations to go on. Mankind is fallible, and I seem fallible to a rather insane degree right now. I promised that I would NEVER lie or hide something from myself again, but all the same, HOW can I know if what I am thinking is what I honestly, truly feel?

I ask this, because, despite some of the evidence I laid out here, the only person that can determine if I am trans* is myself. So, I have to trust myself. I will work at it. It will probably be a slow process, one that requires a lot of patience and a thicker skin than I currently possess (to deal with all the ignorance and fears others will have), but most importantly, I will need to recognize my own limits. It took a long time to overcome some of the bigotry that I acquired early in life- my inner racism and homophobia were eventually eliminated thanks to my interactions with friends, but my inner transphobia is only just starting to be cracked at. This is probably why I fear coming out to my family so much, because much of this phobia probably stems from my parents' upbringing- strict, Roman Catholic, with that old-fashion sense of morality and gender roles. 

So, yeah, I just wish I could trust myself.  If I was confident in who I am, I feel like transitioning wouldn't be a chore so much as just making my body fit my mind.

I'm really sorry for adding another to the pile... I also apologize for all the text I'm sure is to come...

I was never the most masculine boy growing up; in elementary school, I was often mocked for my dislike of playing sports and my high voice. A lot of the time, I preferred playing imaginative games with the girls in my classes, but I eventually gave that up and attempted (unsuccessfully) to fit in with the boys to avoid mockery, or just retreated into lots of reading. I read anything I could get my hands on, and though it could just be coincidence, I ended up reading a great deal of books along the lines of ""Girl has to pretend to be a boy because society won't let her X otherwise"" and always really rooted for their protagonists. The characters that I really identified with ended up predominantly consisting of brainy girls struggling to fit in and find their place; Amy from Sailor Moon and Hermione from Harry Potter were two of my role models.

This didn't really change going into middle and high school. For the last few years, since the option was available, I've wanted to go into choir since I've always really enjoyed singing. I never did though, once again, for fear of mockery. I started regularly wearing outer clothing like hoodies and winter coats (from October through March), possibly subconsciously to hide myself. Unlike the male stereotype, I was always quite sensitive, and always longed to have close friends I could really connect with on an emotional level. Just over this past year or two (I'm 17 now, in Grade 12) I've started to build those connections I've always wanted, both on- and offline, and overwhelmingly the people I've been able to talk to have tended towards female. 

Only quite recently though, after I discovered that two of my online friends were actually transgender (one MtF and one FtM, both presenting as their true genders), did I begin to question who I really am. My online friends, those few I've told of my inner turmoil, have so far been overwhelmingly supportive of me. My offline circumstances (which I'll explain later) preventing me from trying anything visible, I started experimenting with things I could hide. 

The first thing I tried was asking a few of my online friends to start using female pronouns with me, so I could see how I felt hearing them. It must have been at least a month and a half since then, and I haven't had any desire to ask them to stop. It starting to be winter, meaning long sleeves and pants, I experimented with shaving all the hair off my legs, arms and armpits, and found myself excited by how soft and smooth my skin felt without it. Conversely, I've let my hair grow out longer than I usually do. I've always kept my face clean shaven (thinking that my facial hair looked quite unpleasant), so no real changes there. My voice is still fairly high, and I've actually kept some of the upper range I had as a child by singing along to the female parts of songs. Since starting to do all of these things... I can't pretend to myself or to my friends that I haven't felt much more comfortable in my own skin. 

I've been seriously considering the idea that I might really be a girl, as the existence of this post probably suggests... But if I am... I'm really scared about what that might mean in terms of my family. You see... my mom grew up in a Catholic household, and while she's not incredibly conservative, she still does have quite a bit of backwards thinking when it comes to LGBT issues. What do I mean? Well... she doesn't believe that bisexuality exists. I've had discussions with her about this, including bringing up scientific studies to show her, and she still insists that it doesn't actually exist. If she won't believe in bisexuality, what chance would I even have...? I also have no chance of really bringing anything physical into the house to experiment with unless I tell her; I don't really have any space to myself since my mom cleans everywhere, which means no female clothes, hair removal products, or anything else. It also basically means no chance of HRT, if or when I feel ready for it, unless I tell her or move out (which won't be for just under two years since I'm probably doing the first year of university here).  

I'm just at a loss for what to do... Everything seems to be moving so fast emotionally, but at the same time, I feel like I'm constantly walking on a razors edge between trying to discover myself and avoiding discovery by anyone else. I'm not sure if any of you could possibly help, if anyone's been in my situation, but I figured it's worth a shot... Once again, sorry that there's so much, but I sort of just let everything out...

**tl;dr at bottom**


Almost everything that I read always mentioned that family kicked them out, or at least weren't too pleased with them being trans. Because of this, I put it back on my mind and tried to live a normal male life. It ended up not working, and I had to do something and move forward with accepting myself as trans, and eventually transitioning.

Anyway, cut to the good part: yes, there were some troubles with myself regarding transition, but overall everything has been just fine. I got my letter okay-ing HRT, and found a doctor (who didn't even need the letter) to prescribe me hormones...all while in a smaller, more conservative city.

About a month or so after I started HRT, I sent a letter to my mom coming out and explaining everything. She was fine with it. It took her ""about a week to have it settle, but then was fine,"" and the rest of my family were told the next couple months. 

I started laser removal on my face, not mentioning to my technician (privately operating place) I was trans. She actually knew at the beginning since she saw the meds I was on, aka hormones. She was very nice about it and legitimately wanted to help me out. I was a bit wary since I saw crosses, and she seemed religious, and again: smaller conservative city.

My mom even found a lawyer to change my name and gender ID, and only after about 3 weeks of knowing. I got that done in literally a month, and it even happened to be the day after my real birthday. Awesome!

I came out to my work (University on campus job, so a bit more open), since I was starting full time much sooner than originally planned, and needed to find out if I had to find a new place or not. Everyone was fine with it. My name still slips, but that's expected.

Starting the new semester as my true self made me really nervous and anxious, but no one really batted an eye at me. People in classes don't say/point me out or anything. Anyone I pass walking through campus hasn't made any rude remarks.

I've been told I pass well (I just never see it), but my voice still doesn't really. Even when I do talk to new, random people...I get nothing negative. Sometimes I get a little confused or curious look, but nothing harmful.

All my family now knows, and most took it way better than I thought they would. A couple of them mentioned that they wouldn't really think twice about having the *girl name* in the family in a few years. (We don't see each other often) They just want me to be happy, along with my parents.

All the friends I have come out to over the years have no problem with it. Even ones I knew long ago, and a couple that I didn't talk to very much. They all just said it's up to me, that I shouldn't feel ashamed about anything, and wish me to be happy. Some of them even knew something was up with me and knew that something wasn't quite right about the guy me. Once I told them they said it made a whole lot more sense to them.

Most recently, I went to the Career Fair for my college, and was quite nervous about showing myself and speaking to them. I got two interviews for an internship, one of which the recruiter said was ""highly competitive."" None of the interviewers I talked to seemed to look at me any different than any other person.

 I've commented here a little bit. I don't think I would be recognizable to any users here. So we'll make this an introduction. I'm 14 years old. When I was about 6, I discovered the want to be a girl, instead of a boy. Since I was very little, I'd always loved being the princess in the games my brothers and I would play. As I got older it become a need to be the other gender, but I never took seriously. I always assumed it was wrong immoral, or even a phase that everyone goes through. I'd never even thought it would be possible, physically, to change genders.
   
 I'm in 9th grade now. I can't think of anything else. It's been that way for a while now. I've tried to commit suicide twice. My parents, who were extremely unacceptable and angry when I came out to them, have me  seeing multiple therapists. I want to transition but I feel I would (A) Have all the people in my life reject me, and laugh at me behind my back (B) Not be able to pass. I have very broad shoulders and square jaw and I don't think I could pass. Which I would hate more then being me. (C) Loose my singing voice. I know MtF hormones don't alter the voice, and my singing voice is the one thing that I like about me and if I lost it, I on't know what I'd do. 
    
I always wanted to be a small petite girl. But I know that every moment I wait, that idea falls away. I want to start blocking the testosterone and maybe even transition sometime soon. But I need to know what to tell my therapist to get them on my side. And, I'm too embarrassed to talk to my parents. How do I tell them about my desires? And, am      I being stupid? Should I just stop?

1347907079.0,20,self.asktransgender,1019f0,For those of you discovering yourself.,hdsht16,27,7,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1019f0/for_those_of_you_discovering_yourself/,"All right, this is not going to help you now per se, except to know that there are so many like you... ANND this will be long...

99% of people(myself included) are brought up to fit into societal norms, repress our true selves, and conform to the rules laid before us. We are taught that we should never question those rules because they are what makes this ""world"" work.

We are told to be ourselves, what if being yourself is not sharing and sitting in your room all day... Well that is unacceptable, so we are told to share, and play outside with friends, but wait, that's not what I want to do. Then you go to school and are disciplined for doodling or playing around. They say ""Jonny has ADHD because he won't pay attention during math and is always lost in his own world, he needs meds."" Well Jonny here was developing his imagination, he was creating himself. But, you see, that's not allowed, he must follow ""our"" rules. So they dope him up or punish him to make sure he listens to his ""elders"".

Well those ""elders"" are actually 25-45 year old children who have never been able to think for themselves. They are kept in line by their peers, as no one wants to be an outcast. These older children(called so because they have yet to mature to the point to question the meaning of life and the learn from theirs and others mistakes) turn around and have kids and raise them they way they were raised.(read: fit into what is normal)

Well the problem here is there is no such thing as normal. The idea of normal is a make believe point on a bell curve where everybody agrees on what is acceptable... Hmmm, I never agreed on such a thing, nor has anyone else I talked to. But here we are with families, friends, communities, cities, states, and nations that have this sense of normality that directs culture and eradicates those things that fall too far from this preconceived notion of normal.

So these new people come into this amazing world full of potential, but the first they learn is to repress that potential. You are not allowed to cry, touch that thing whatever it may be, play with dolls, or play hell play with YOURSELF. I mean come on... You are not allowed to even explore your own body. That is a no no, by the ""normal"" standards. No self gratification for you. So now not only are you taught to be ""yourself"" only if yourself listens to all the rules but you are alienated from your own body. People wonder why all this violence and need for an all powerful government exists. Well there is the beginning of an answer.

Now with both parents working and the lack of a communal upbringing of the youth, they are told the way relationships, society, nature, the world and the universe works by mainstream(normal) TV and media. Look at the interwebs, a person expresses themselves and you have a million people(seemingly normal) making fun of that person or saying why that person is wrong. That is culture eradicating aspects of people that it doesn't agree with.

So all of these thoughts and feelings you have that were truly yours have been suppressed in you to an almost nonexistent state and you are taught by repetition that you best not question the norms, for if you do, you will be casted out of certain groups and humiliated. You pick up attitudes and traits that are ""normal"" just to fit in and have a place in this seemingly not so great world. You feel something is off and wrong, but you can't put a finger on it because everyone else is appearently ok and happy. Well guess what...They are not ok. They are just playing this awful game of fitting in. Some do it better than others, some completely let go of any hope to be themselves a long time ago. What a great lie!

When I was in my teens and early 20's, I thought I was in the know, I thought I knew everything as long as I followed in the foot steps of those who came before. I thought that it was impossible for so many to be so disillusioned. Well after talking with many many friends, co-workers, family members, and strangers, I have come to a conclusion... No one knows what they are doing. They are just playing a game(though they don't know it's a game) and are following everyone else. Many of them think they know the answers, whether it be money, peer acceptance, power, or whatever else defines ""happiness"".

Of all of the people I have experienced life with only a handful of people have said ""follow yourself, you are the only answer for the course of your life."" Osho has a technique on meditation that is truly eye opening. Act like you are the first human being to exist. Make the rules for life as you go along, because you are the ruler and GOD of your life.

Now society condemns the above, because society as we know it would fall apart if everyone did that. Society is a living thing and will fight to survive like any other living thing. We are the hosts of this parasite. But there is a cure... that cure is you! All they hatred and biggotry cannot exist if we all, one by one said ""I will not perpetuate your disease!""

It has taken me my entire adult life(and by no stretch of the imagination am I done, or do I have all the answers) to come to this conclusion---&gt; Most of what we call life is a big fat LIE But, you see, this lie is all we(society at large) know, Humans are much more comfortable in a lie where they they think they know the answers than to live in a world where everyone is responsible for creating themselves. I mean look at all that work that is needed to create myself I will just follow what is laid before me.

I feel you, as I have been in your shoes, and I still am to some extent. I am currently dealing with my repressed self, the woman I always knew I was. There are these layers, similar to an onion, where at the center is my perfect self, that beautiful, happy to be alive woman. And covering that up is all of these learned beliefs, behaviors, and societal norms that have been ingrained in me to the point that I've mistaken them for me. I was taught to fit the masculine role by my father and society, even though it never meshed with my true self.

The act and art of creating yourself is a life long journey. You will not wake up one day and have yourself. The mind reverts to those learned behaviors, similar to a computer booting up and loading the default OS, but there is a way to by pass that load up your own OS. That way is through introspection and self analysis. It is a long, scary, and often times torturous road. But god damn is it worth it.

Be your own ruler and God.

While gender dysphoria and transsexualism (or whatever you want to call the umbrella over us) are actual phenomena, we live in a world where gender transition is only an option for a privileged minority. I live in a third world shithole: I am not in that minority. Transition is impossible for me.   

I am tired of being refused care. I am weary of searching for some scrap of support. I don't have heart enough to follow **yet another** dead end breadcrumb trail of *possible* resources. There is nothing. Even if/when I get out, the damage done to me is too much. I am so angry. I am full of so much hate: for myself and everyone around me. Everyone reacts to me with disgust and doubt: and they're right. I'm done. I will never be a girl. I *am* delusional, disgusting, deformed and other deprecating D words.  

I'm nothing. I'm gone. I'm not going anywhere, but I'm *gone*. Thanks to everyone who helped or tried to help; I'm glad spaces like this exist. I do think that there is a wider social shift toward greater acceptance of trans people, but I'm never going to see it actually happen. I'm glad hope exists for anyone, but too many of us are just gone.  

This is a useless post. I'm sorry. I don't know what to do anymore. I wish I could just turn this off.   

edit: I apologize. I feel really bad for posting this; it was a mistake. I'll provide some context: I've been seriously considering transition for 10 years, and actively *trying* to transition for 2 or 3 years, but I live in a region where awareness of transgender issues is basically negative--people either have a hateful attitude, or everything they know is just incorrect. Therapists who can help are nonexistent. The only LGBT support group is very small, and basically a one person borderline out-of-the-home operation. I'm glad it exists, but it's less a strong professional support network and more a group of individuals just doing what they can.  

I've been on DIY hormones for about 6 months at the lowest therapeutic dose, but I'm uncomfortable increasing that dose without a prescription or medical supervision, and I've spoken with practically every doctor, clinic, etc. in the area and been refused care. Sometimes the refusal is polite; sometimes it is not. Just having to initiate the topic and say, ""I am transgender and looking for someone to oversee my hormone therapy blah blah blah"" is intensely difficult for me, and my anxiety gets *worse* every time I have to do that.   

Anyway, a kind redditor recently pointed me to the aforementioned only LGBT support group, and they were surprisingly nice and helpful--they do have a trans member, but what she's had to do won't work for me. I can't afford to leave the state for basic care. They were able to recommend her local doctor to me, and I made an appointment ASAP. That appointment was yesterday; it was very upsetting and I'm just trying to decompress now. Venting here is part of that, but I think it wasn't really a good idea. I just can't bottle this up this time.  

Just getting there was stressful--it's an hour and a half drive, plenty of time to freak out. But once I sat down, the conversation went poorly. She was confused why I hadn't had SRS yet, and seemed to think that I should have SRS before starting hormones. I tried to explain that that is sort of backwards, and offered to share treatment protocols. She was willing to discuss HRT a little, and said she'd do more research and contact me later (more than anyone else has ever done), but she seemed uncomfortable with the idea and I just found the whole thing too upsetting. I just can't deal with this right now.  

So I'm just putting my transition off indefinitely, I guess, which hurts because it's *already* been put off indefinitely by the lack of resources. I am hunting for work, and I may find a job and be able to leave soon, but I really don't know how long it will take.  

Sorry. I seriously hate throwing my personal life and emotions here, and I regret posting at all today, but I wanted to come back and explain.

If the title didn't suggest it already, I'm MTF and I've been trying to work on my voice recently.

Accordingly, I looked up a bunch of online resources, like [Finding Your Female Voice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO41CpUW7IM), [CandiFLA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7qSJ19f_QU), [Jackie's voice page](http://voice.sngjackie.com/), [some other people who are probably less well known](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZo6_xYn-hc), and [Heliotroper](http://soundcloud.com/heliotroper/my-little-voice-tutorial) and [ExceptionToTheRule's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGYwFPKjy9E) in the Friday Night Voice Threads.

I feel like I've listened/watched them all over and over and over again and I don't get it. Partially because each of them tells you something different and occasionally contradictory - for example, Jackie's voice page states that you not only have to get into head voice, but you also have to have a feminine timbre by moving your Adam's Apple up, but the other pages suggest that moving your Adam's Apple is what lets you use your head voice and achieve that feminine resonance anyways.

After watching all of these videos, I honestly have no idea what to do or what I'm doing wrong. I also have no idea if I'm actually using head voice or if I'm just doing a bad airy, low falsetto when I practice. I record myself and it's obviously masculine sounding, but I can't describe why exactly it sounds masculine and how to improve it. If I don't know what I'm doing wrong, how can I do it right?

What I'm doing now is putting my hand on my chest and my finger on my Adam's Apple so I don't feel chest resonance and my Adam's Apple is high up and you can't see it anymore. I also use a spectrogram so I know that I'm on 200-220 Hz. I also put my other hand in front of my mouth so I can feel the breathiness (or sometimes I hold my phone to record myself with this hand). It's not working, but I feel like I hit every point described in those tutorials.

Well, that was pretty much an extremely unorganized rant because I'm just so frustrated. But how did you get your female voices and how long did it take? Are there any tips you could spare an unfortunate transwoman?

Thank you! :)

Maybe I could Skype someone or something like that? (Although I'm very rarely alone and I don't know how loudly I could speak without disturbing people on my dorm hall....) I'd be willing to do ANYTHING at this point! ANYTHING. I JUST DON'T GET IT.

As a point of reference I'm a caucasian cis female that grew up very sheltered, and only became aware of transgender issues when I left for university. I do have a F2M cousin that came out (I think that's the right usage) since then, and I've always been fully supportive of him. So I'm somewhat aware of transgender issues and try to be respectful and use correct language, but if I'm not using a term right, I don't mean any disrespect by it.

I'm a university student and during my summers I love to travel. This summer I've been traveling through southeast asia, and happen to be in Thailand at the moment. Last night I was alone on the roof deck of the hotel I'm at, just sitting out enjoying the evening, when a woman came out and sat down with me and we struck up conversation. She said that she came here to support her friend, who was in a nearby hospital to have SRS surgery. Knowing how hard transpersons lives can be from things my cousin has told me, I thought that it was really great of this woman to be able to support her friend in such a way. 

Then she started drinking and after a bit she began making really transphobic comments like about ""men getting their penis chopped off"" and such (her words, not mine), and I began to get uncomfortable with how disrespectful she was being. Anyway, after she had several drinks (and seemed to be quite drunk to me) she asked me why I was here in Thailand, and if I had the surgery. I told her that I was just here to meet people and see the country, to which she replied ""Yeah right! Show me your penis!"" At this I decided I'd had enough talking with her and left. 

I'm sorry that the above story is so long, but here's the point where I'm asking for input. After she essentially accused me of being transgendered, my initial reaction was that I felt offended. I've been trying to sort out my feelings on this, but my question really boils down to: was my initial reaction, by feeling offended, a sign of transphobia? I really do try to be a good person, and if my initial reaction was transphobic I don't want to be dishonest with myself and just ignore it, I would rather address those feelings. So please, does how I reacted sound like transphobia to you, and if so, how can I overcome it?

Hello Everyone,

As you may or may not be aware, my appearance has changed somewhat since beginning work at [Company Name] almost two years ago.

Essentially, I have a brain that aligns more with female, and a body that aligned more with male.  This is known medically as Gender Identify Dysphora and more casually as Transsexualism.

To correct this issue, I have been in the process of changing my physical body to match that of my mind since before I began working at [Company Name].  At this point it has become unrealistic to keep this from the company at large.

With the love and support of many people (friends, family, members of the [Professional Association] community, and many awesome colleagues here) I have presented as a visible gender of female since late April outside of work. 

On July [Censored], my name will legally be changed to [Full Name].  I would greatly prefer to be addressed as [Name] or [Common Nick Name], and very much prefer female pronouns for all past, present and future tenses.  I understand that switching names and pronouns is generally an alien concept and that mistakes will happen.

If you use an incorrect name or pronoun, I would recommend simply moving on with the conversation without correcting it.  Along the same terms, if we're at a conference , company happy hour, or other event with those outside of the company, I would appreciate it if the information in this email is not divulged to those it was not given to.

If you have questions, please feel free to email or [IM] me.

**[Below is the original, keeping for purposes of some of the comments making more sense]** 

Hello Everyone,

As you may or may not be aware, my appearance has changed somewhat since beginning work at [Company] almost two years ago.

Essentially, I have a congenital disorder that causes the physiological construction of a female brain, with the hormonal traits and physical body of a male.  This has resulted in high anxiety in many in-person social situations, and depending greatly on mediums of social interaction where the body is immaterial -- such as the Internet.

To correct this issue, I have been in the process of changing my physical body to match that of my mind since before I began working at [Company].  At this point it has become unrealistic to keep this from the company at large.

With the love and support of many people (friends, family, members of the [Professional Association] community, and many awesome colleagues here) I have presented [trans-knowledge word… what to say instead?] as female since late April outside of work, and will be presenting at work as female when I return.

On July [Censored], my name will legally be changed to [Censored].  I would greatly prefer to be addressed as [Censored | Female Name] or [Censored | Female Name ], and very much prefer female pronouns for all past, present and future tenses.

These changes have culminated in much more happiness and contentment with myself, and I greatly appreciate the openness, understanding and general awesomeness of [Company] that has made me comfortable to discuss this with you.  If you have any questions, please feel free to email.

FINALLY made an appointment with a much recommended therapist(thanks asktg!) and am feeling a bit of relief from the issues regarding knowing I was trans and not doing anything regarding transition yet, as, now I am starting.

That said, I don't want to TRANSITION.

Don't get me wrong. I am decidedly NOT male, I feel very female, and certainly want to be one. I just don't want to deal with the whole damned process. 

I don't want to be trans. I don't want to have to figure out demeanour, or retrain my voice. I don't want to deal with social repercussions of transitioning WHILE I transition. I just want to be a cis-woman. 

I've been having little dysphoria spats that make me want to cry, when I see a women(often in groups, or about my age) that I know have lived their entire lives as women and never had to struggle with it. I look at my **lovely** *very* pregnant wife, and have such conflicting emotions of excitement(for being a parent) and dysphoria for not being able to carry that child myself.

I just have been feeling really frustrated that i'm not cis- lately. and not a cis-man but rather a cis woman, and the fact I will never quite be PERFECTLY female(organs, past, previous social conditioning and all) is driving me to internal meltdowns [it feels like] every hour.

Do any of you feel this way? And if yes, as I am sure SOMEONE else does, how the hell do you deal with it? 


EDIT for clarification here:
I guess I should clarify in my OP on that one... it's not about looks, or passing when I say 'perfectly female'(though those are issues that I have too)

I have known that I am transgender for about 14 years now and when I tried coming out to my parents, they reacted... poorly, I guess?  My mother said a few things, like, ""I would have rather you had been gay."" and my father said, after my mother asked if I would be interested in being with men or women, ""Oh, so you're a lesbian trapped in a man's body?"" which was said rather incredulously.  To be fair, I see myself with either gender, but I didn't want them saying that I was ""just gay"", etc. at the time.

Anyway, after that, I just pushed it to the back of my mind, letting them think it was just a phase.  By the time high school ended, I had started a serious relationship with someone which has lasted to this day.  I'm now a parent and have never revisited the subject of transition.

My partner knows about how I felt when we got together but the relationship is basically over if I ever do transition.  I have two children now, which makes it a little more complicated.  I work in a job where, while I make good money, is a blue collar, man dominated field that even women catch flack for being part of, let alone anyone from the LGBT community.  I also feel that being almost 30, I don't think I'd get results I'd like from HRT.  I also don't look in the mirror in disgust or anything.  I know who I am and it doesn't match my body, but I don't dislike my body at all.

I've had a couple of moments in the past where I've been struck with the strange sensation of having, I guess a 'phantom vagina' or feeling like I didn't have anything down there. Obviously I wouldn't know what having a vagina feels like or not having a penis feels like. I can count on one hand the number of times I've been struck with this sensation and I've always thought it was a bit weird and wasn't really sure what to make of it. Now after hearing that some transmen have reported a phantom penis I have to wonder if maybe this doesn't explain this odd feeling I've had?
Has something like this ever happened to anyone else on the mtf side? 

Edit: 

Colour me surprised. I actually didn't expect many people to have experienced this. The only times it has happened to me I've been especially unhappy about not be a girl and its only been a fleeting sensation I've gotten when I'm half awake and not all there mentally. Although the first time it happened it was a more extreme sensation.

The first time it happened was extremely awkward though. It was back when I was in high school and I had fallen asleep in a computer class. As I sort of came to, the sensation hit me, a bit hard to describe but it was followed by tingly sensation starting where a vagina would be and kinda moving up inside me. My reaction was 'wtf was that' it was pretty awkward waking up being disoriented anyway from sleep to that sensation, and then to realize a lot of my friends and classmates are standing around me, still listening to the lecture fortunately.

There are times when some of us really feel trans and think that they've always been like that. In hindsight, it even seems obvious, I'll look for even the most ridiculous details of my childhood and use them as proof to convince myself that I always had those feelings, there is no doubt at all.

Then it goes away (I can't really say that I feel like a male when it happens but I do not wish to transition, I just don't ... care about it, it doesn't make me happy or unhappy, it disappears) and when I look back at the time when I experienced those feelings, it seems that the whole thing was ridiculous.

So far, so good, that's pretty much how it usually goes isn't it ? My denial is often based on the assumption that I'm probably experiencing weird yet pretty common feelings that everybody has. I assumed that everybody thought about it once in a while and trans people experienced stronger feelings and actually wanted to do something about it.

But ... is it really true ? I talked with a few male friends who are probably not trans (99% sure) if they ever thought about being a girl and their answer was either ""No, not at all"" as if I was talking about something really absurd that only occured in comedy movies or a bit perverted (they'd turn into a girl to do perverted things, I'm pretty sure they weren't even serious about it). I then asked my parents (they don't know about it) and they didn't even understand the question and answered with a ""what ? that's ... stupid).

**tl;dr Always thought that everybody thought about being / becoming someone of the opposite sex once in a while and that it was both common and normal, how stupid is that assumption ?**

I don't intend to compete or antagonize any established trans related subreddit, but I do feel it's sometimes not for me. That's why I created /r/transpositive to share the positive, the funny and the lighthearted. It is also a place for support and friendship.
&gt;
&gt;Why? Because I know at least I could use some transpositivity now and then, and in my dark years I would've loved reading positive material regarding trans people. If I can put a smile or inspire another trans person, then that smile would make my day.

About four months ago, I asked my friends to stop calling me my legal name, and to substitute my initials ""while I figure some shit out."" At that point I had no idea what I was going to do, but I knew I was miserable and something had to give. I pretty quickly came to the conclusion that I needed to transition medically, but I wasn't in a rush, and I made an appointment to see my general practitioner to basically see what I needed to do to get myself set up. The plan was to have myself settled in a new job before I started hormones, and I was thinking I might start by the end of the summer.

Promptly after I made that appointment, my health insurance lapsed and I canceled the appointment.

Since then, my general agitation about not moving forward has escalated with increasing rapidity. This kind of caught me off-guard, I figured if I could chill in the closet for ten years, then a couple more months would be nbd. Things got a lot shittier last week, when I found out that NYS Medicaid is re-structuring the way they pay for mental health treatment, effectively halving the frequency with which I get to see my therapist, who is the only person I feel like I have to talk to about this shit. I've been feeling so miserable and isolated and I hate it.

Today I was walking home from a psych appointment, and I basically bawled the entire way, so instead of going home I walked straight to my doctor's office and asked them if I could make an appointment even though my Medicaid case is still pending, and they were like, ""Oh, yeah, sure,"" and I was like, ""Well, damn, why didn't I think about this before."" The next available appointment with my GP wasn't until the middle of next month, so I just started crying again, and the receptionist offered me an appointment in two weeks with a nurse practitioner. And I just need to do something, so I said fine, even though she's not my doctor maybe she can tell me what to do. And then I couldn't stop crying, so she went and got a nurse who took me in the back and asked what was wrong.

After like 5 minutes I was able to get out ""I can't be a girl anymore."" And the nurse was like, oh, ok. And she got me a wash cloth to wash my face and hugged me and told me she'd talk to the nurse I made the appointment with, so that she'd be prepared and I wouldn't have to tell her why I was there and she said it was going to be ok because now I'm starting. She said she doesn't know much about it, but the clinic has lots of trans patients.

So I feel like I accomplished something. After I meet with the NP, maybe I can have a real plan, and things will be better.

I'm male and have known a (biological) guy for a few months.  We've gradually become friends and he recently confided in me that he's transgender.  This utterly blew me away because he's easily the most masculine person I've ever met.  He's a former Marine, extremely muscular, and currently a professional athlete is a very testosterone-driven sport.  He's also somewhat well-known due to his sport (you probably wouldn't recognize his name, but he occasionally gets people stopping him on the street).

He's out to his family, close circle of friends, and his commercial sponsors.  There are also hushed, though persistent rumors online.  But he hasn't come out to the world yet because he's worried about it impacting both his family and his career.  Though he's at the point in his life where he's just tired of pretending to be something that he's not.  I suspect that he'll eventually make it known publicly.  

He's a very intellectual guy and has been very open about discussing the nature of his gender identity with me.

I have been on estrogen for almost 8 months and am at the point where no matter what I wear, people gender me female. I am really excited about this, but it has caused some issues trying to still pass as a boy at work (I'm a grad student). People who know me in the lab and don't know I'm trans still see me as a boy and haven't brought up noticing any changes (though who knows what they say behind my back). However, people who I have never met now gender me female. 

This has caused some awkward situations, like today. Another grad student and I were helping to unload bags of soil for our experiments from a truck. The truck driver walked up to us and said to me ""little lady, this bag is too heavy for you."" I froze because the other student doesn't know I'm trans and we just looked at each other without speaking. I was trying not to laugh at how awkward the situation was and how obnoxious the driver was being :P But my friend leaned over and whispered ""what a toolbag!""

* How fast does it grow?

* Does it grow in length and width?

* Can it become overly sensitive? Does it lose any sensitivity?

* Can it get spontaneous erections? Morning erections? Erections when you are turned on?

* Is it situated in the same way as a cis-male penis? Can it be used the same for intercourse?

* What does it look like when ""flaccid""? Does it hide under the labia, like a cis-female clitoris, or does the size make it stick out all the time?

* What does it feel like? Can you feel it brushing up against your underwear?

* How does it change masturbation techniques?

* Is there any increase in ejaculate? I am assuming any ejaculate continues to come from the vagina (or is it from the the urethra? I was never really sure on that point)

* Does it take longer, less time, or the same amount of time to orgasm?

* Do orgasms feel any different?

Are there any others that I can't (or at least, haven't yet) think of?

I know that it's not likely for a transperson to be completely comfortable with their bodies until they've finished their transition, but I intend on doing everything I can to make her feel as good as possible.

Fortunately, she doesn't have a problem when we have sex, she says that I make her dysphoria go away, at least for the duration and a little bit of time after that (when she first told me that, it made me feel awesome).

As I was reading this part of the book, I started to realize that I *really* crave my dad's approval of my transition, and not only that, but a father-daughter relationship with him.

Right now, I feel like he just looks at me like his son, and not his daughter - and because of that, I worry that he looks negatively towards me for wanting to be a girl, and for being a ""failure of a man"". I'm not full time, and one of the biggest things keeping me from going full time is the fact that I feel *extremely* uncomfortable dressing around him, because of the above reasons. (I live with my parents at the moment)

My dad is a bit of a stoic, and when I ask him how he feels about my transition he just sort of shrugs and says ""I dunno.."". I feel like he doesn't approve, but doesn't want to say anything to hurt my feelings.

I live close to DC, and for some reason he has been mentioning to me every time a trans woman gets attacked up there.. I don't know if he's doing this to try to discourage me from transitioning, or if it's because he worries for my safety (or both). The latest one was the first thing he mentioned to me when I woke up the other day.. not exactly the best thing to wake up hearing.

More on the father-daughter relationship thing: I have two sisters, and both of them are treated much differently than my dad treats me. My dad constantly gets on me for doing things incorrectly, but I never really seem to see him do this to my sisters, and he has that sort of father's protective behavior towards them that I don't receive. It makes me depressed, and realizing all of this caused me to cry myself to sleep last night.. :(

Has anyone else had feelings like this? I don't know if these are just feelings that I've repressed, or if it's something new from HRT, or a little bit of both.. but I really want to confront my dad about all of this but I don't really know how, and I know doing so is going to cause me to cry in front of him.",,False,,t5_2r4b9,True,,,True,t3_khdsu,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/khdsu/has_anyone_else_experienced_something_like_this/,

From my understanding, most of us don't. 

I don't involve myself much with the trans community in real life, but myself and the two trans people I know do not (at this present time, I guess that could change) want any genital surgery.

Since I started hormones, I have grown ever more comfortable with my equipment. I'm FtM, one of my best friends is MtF and she feels the same way. It makes us both quite angry how obsessed everyone seems to be with genitals. The first question thrown at any trans person is regarding down there, as if it's the deciding factor on whether your a man or a woman - regardless of how you present yourself. And in most places around the world, you have to have lower surgery to legally change your gender?? It's fucking disgusting.

There seems to be a lot of pressure on trans people to ""go all the way"", whatever the fuck that means. My dysphoria is pretty much fixed now, it was about reaching a place of comfortability with myself. It happened once I'd been on hormones for a while and had a double mastectomy and the world started treating me like a man. However you reach that comfortability with yourself is irrelevant! If you get there by just presenting as the opposite sex, hormone treatment, minor surgery or major surgery shouldn't matter.

I feel like more people like me need to speak out. **For me, being trans isn't fundamentally about genitals, it's about identity and the world accepting that identity.**

I hope that, even if you disagree, you'll appreciate my concerns. I have felt pressured by medical professionals throughout my transition to conform to a standard way of doing things. I'm fortunate enough to live in the UK, where you can change your gender on all documents without going through surgery.

If it matters at all to the context of what I'm writing, I'm a heterosexual, cisgender, married male.

Both this person and I are active on a web site that relates to our profession.  We haven't really ""crossed paths"" on that site, but I recognize that person's real name when I see it, and I bet they recognize mine too.

I have a phone interview coming up with a particular company, and I just found out that this person works there from something like an employee list -- I thought to myself, *oh, I recognize PersonX's name!  I wonder if I can find out anything more about PersonX...*  And one Google search later, pretty much *all* the Google results are articles about PersonX being a victim of discrimination against transgender people.

I'm mad because, due to the site that we are both active on, I know that PersonX is very skilled at what they do; I expected the Google results to primarily include PersonX's profession, but that was not at all the case.

So if my phone interview goes well and I get a chance to go to this company for another interview, I would love to introduce myself to PersonX; I imagined that the conversation would have gone something like ""Hi PersonX, it's me, BornAgainGropaga!  I've seen your name on SomeWebsite so many times, and it's a pleasure to finally meet you.  I think it would be great to work together because I know that you are very skilled at what you do.""  And I still could say just that, but...

I want to meet this person and say, ""Hi PersonX, it's me, BornAgainGropaga!  I'm excited to meet you in person.  I did a Google search for your name, but pretty much all i could find out was how you were a victim of discrimination.  This upset me because nobody should have to go through that, but also because I expected to find information about how good you are at your profession.  I want you to know that I support the rights of transgender people, and if I get this job and I would really look forward to working with someone as skilled as you.""

Would that second approach be ""too much"" for a first time meeting someone?  Alternatively I could do the whole second approach over email, but then it might seem like I'm fishing for some extra pull in getting this job.

The last option would be to pretend like I don't know PersonX if I can even meet them, but I would hate to pass up an opportunity to make a friend or to brighten PersonX's day.

Sorry if I've rambled a bit here.  I would really appreciate any advice /r/asktransgender can offer.

**tl;dr**: May meet a transgender person who I know is skilled at what they do, I want them to know that I look forward to working with them in a professional capacity, and I want them to know that I support transgender rights and equality, and that I am angry about the fact that they have been discriminated against and that is the only thing that comes up in Google for this person.

-----

**UPDATE**:  Thank you everyone for your responses.  It's only been a few hours since the original post so of course there hasn't been any development in the job hunt or meeting PersonX, but you have all helped clarify to me that the first approach would be great and the second approach would be simply out of line.

Your responses helped point out to me that I should put myself in PersonX's shoes: if someone met me for the first time and said, ""Hi B.A.G., I love your Reddit posts, but I heard about that time you got mugged and I think that is just awful..."" I would also be displeased that they were focusing on an experience of mine and not *me*.

I'm not sure that I've ever met a transgender person before here in the midwest, so I think I just got a little worked up in trying to ... make sure I didn't come off like *someone from the midwest who has never met a transgender person before.*  Now, I'm definitely experiencing some [hindsight bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias) that I should have known bringing up the incident is certainly not an acceptable topic for a first meeting, if ever.  If I ever get to know PersonX and they bring it up, we can talk about it then; it is not my place to bring it up.

 I’m a 20 year old cis-male, and have been having issues with gender identity going back to age 12 or so (basically around the time I hit puberty). For basically my whole life, I have felt like kind of an outsider; when I was very young, I remember that I often didn’t get along very well with most of the boys my age, and often sought out the company of girls instead. I always wanted to wear my hair long as a kid, despite my parents’ objections, and clearly remember having a pretty intense, inexplicable distaste for both the sound of my voice and seeing myself in mirrors for as long as I can remember; but I don’t think I ever consciously questioned, or even gave much thought at all to my gender throughout childhood.

 From middle school onward, I started having what I now recognize as full blown gender dysphoria; I became extremely socially awkward (not just in a normal, teenage way; this was the beginning of some pretty serious social anxiety problems) and developed major depression and a bunch of emotional problems that lead to me being put on Zoloft. Medication did help me repress some of the troubling thoughts I was experiencing, but I think it just made me act out on my problems in other ways, and it was during this time that I first attempted (and, thankfully, failed miserably at) suicide; I still don’t know exactly what was going thorough my mind when I did this, but I’m fairly certain GD was involved. I tried to reassure myself that any trans feelings I was experiencing were probably just the result of some weird sexual kink, or perhaps just insecurity with my own lack of masculinity; and tried my best to push them out of my mind. The fact that I was now sexually attracted to girls, and could no longer just think of them as friends, furthered my feelings of alienation. Later in high school, I stopped taking my medication, and it was like every bit of gender dysphoria I had been repressing before came rushing back into the forefront of my mind; I did my best to combat these realizations with a combination of illicit drug use and masculinizing my appearance (growing a beard, cutting my hair, etc.), which, of course, only made me feel way worse in the end.

 When I finally found out what transgenderism actually meant (I had previously thought transwomen were basically just gay men who liked to crossdress), I connected the dots in my head; but still felt too scared to admit anything to myself. 2 years later, and I’m still questioning my own feelings and struggling to figure out were to go next; I really don’t want to start outing myself to any of my friends, let alone family, until I feel completely sure that I am transgendered; I have also have some history of moderately bad OCD (with some hypochodriac tendencies) and can’t help but wonder if this whole thing is just some sort of self-delusion, although it really doesn’t feel that way.

 This is literally the first time I have ever told anyone that I felt this way, so I would appreciate any advice anyone can give about coming out, dealing with getting therapy/hormones, whatever.

I also identify as somewhat genderqueer, if only because I've never really thought of myself as either female or male, nor do I seem to act or think in many traditionally 'feminine' ways. I don’t consider myself transgender, however; I'm more or less fine with my body the way it is, and I don't have any desire to transition. 

Now here's where I might start putting my foot in my mouth. I'm going to use ""s/he"" for the next part, because I'm not sure what the person I'm going to be referencing wants to be called, and I haven't seen a consistent rule for using terms such as ""zhe"" and so forth. I don't know if ""s/he"" is considered incorrect or impolite; it’s the best thing I could think to use here, and I apologize if I'm in the wrong. 

So I found someone on OkCupid. S/he is listed as a lesbian, with an 'f' marked for gender. But in the written profile, s/he says s/he is ""trans-identified."" The photos make it clear that s/he is FTM, but s/he still choose the 'f' and 'lesbian' labels, rather than 'm' and 'straight,' which is why I'm uncertain about the preferred form of address here. 

Given my own genderqueer-ness, I’m fine with all kinds of minds. And I can dig some pretty wide variations in the human body, too. But I *am* gay, so I think there may be a certain level of transition beyond which my own wiring would no longer be able to pass Go and collect $200.

Now, normally I would never dream of asking about someone's transition status. It's just not any of my business. But I know that trans-identified people can have radically different approaches toward transitioning, and some don't transition at all. And in this case, if things move along with us, that information is going to be very relevant. 

**Actual question:** I've never dated someone transgender before, so I'd love to know what the etiquette is, here. Would it be acceptable/expected for me to ask about this, and, if so, after how long and in what way? Or is that horribly rude? Do I just wait until s/he brings it up? I truly don’t mind waiting; I'm relatively patient, and I think we'll mesh well as friends regardless. But I think s/he deserves to know my potential limits as early as possible, too, you know? 

Any of your assorted thoughts, opinions, and experiences regarding this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Again, I apologize if I've gotten something wrong here.  As a gay woman, I've certainly put up with my fair share of obnoxious and clueless questions, so I really hope I've only come across as the latter, and not the former. And with that, I will end my epic question before I manage to make more of a hash of it than I already have. Many thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this and respond.

**Edit:** Thank you all for your replies; I'll try to respond to them as soon as possible. I especially wanted to say that it's clear I've been mixing up ""transgender"" with ""transsexual"" in my head, and I'm so, so glad I learned that sooner rather than later. So thank you again; this is exactly the kind of information I really needed to know.",,False,,t5_2r4b9,True,,,True,t3_hw4r6,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/hw4r6/clueless_lesbian_seeks_transgender_dating_advice/,

Hello hello~ First of all I gotta say I have no clue how to word this so... yeah.

I'm Michelle, 19 year old mtf(Very open about it to most people) desperately seeking  help in whatever form it comes in.(Who isn't?) I live in a house with an abusive brother and a mom who's unsupportiveness is only matched by her ability to make me feel like shit. I'm taking Spiro, working, and just trying to move on with my life. I mean I live in a trap house for christs sake.(Its a daily kinda thing, waking up to get some breakfast and walking in on a gang of nigga's cookin crack in your kitchen. Pretty unsettling.) 

Of course We've lived this way our whole lives. My dad used to be around to physically protect us (Dealing with crack heads aint safe) But than he tried to kill my mom and got locked up when I was 6. Having to deal with people getting beaten to near death in your backyard isent great. And worrying about meth heads either ratting your mom out or killing her isent fun either.  Now me? I'm a hard worker, I'm respectful, polite, and horribly horribly depressed. The pain I feel... i'm not sure if its because i've never really had a place I felt comfortable sleeping in that I could call home? Or if its because being transgendered is the worst card in life that could ever be dealt, in my opinon.

So I mean I live on a poverty level that sucks pretty bad, Usually I hafto worry about where i'm gonna get food, My own safety, being accepted. Most people worry about some boyfriend here, or a car accident there but I work to survive. Speaking of work, I do it, and alot. I have an incredible work ethic and my customer service is exceptional. I know my problems don't stem from me being lazy or anything weak like that. I have an incredibly strong will... but this stuff kinda wears me down over time. Even work, I hafto stand infront of a mirror and pretend like I actually like the man getting ready for work that I see. It honestly kills me when i'm working and someone refers to me as sir, I don't sulk in that pain, but its still there. My job is like a prison for my transgendered self and blah, I hate it. All the other girls get to wear their hair how they want it and paint their nails and blah blah blah, If my hair is touching my ears I don't have a job there.

Now lets not get this wrong, my body isent so horribly manly that some hormones wouldent fix me right up. My depression definantly doesnt stem from there. To be honest... I am ashamed of being transgendered. I hate myself, I just want to die... so badly. So a little over a week ago I was hit with a horrible depressive slump and I couldent bring myself to come into work. It's not like I was at home playing video games, I pretty much just left my house. I was sick of it and couldent go on. I thank my body for having such a strong will to live because for about 3 days I lived on the streets trying to kill myself one way or another. Walking down the street pleading with myself to have enough courage to jump infront of that semi headed this way just so I don't hafto deal with this pain anymore. Something snapped though, I think it was my stomach, and in the end I came home. Came home only to find my mom saying she was sick of my brothers shit (Remember he's physically abusive) and that the only thing holding her back was me and my brother and that she could just go live somewhere super cheap and never hafto worry about anything if it wasent for us. Which she's told us our whole lives. So when I got back from being homeless than I discover she's decided to stop paying rent and is not going to renew the lease and dosn't care where we go. Which is irrelevant because she doesn't pay the bills, my grandma does, she spends all her money on crack and shit. And my grandma said she's done paying so we gettin kicked out unless my mom feels like providing for her children. Also she stoped buying groceries as soon as I got a job. If I don't spend money on food for me and my 1 brother and 1 step brother, than we don't eat. And its not really like I can hold out on them. Being physically controlled by men is disgusting... But I digress.

So I was a no call no show for work for 2 days got a 1 week suspension and I go back tommrow. I'm thinking about just pulling my manager aside and telling him all this because I am DESPERATE. I need help... so bad. I just emotionally don't have the strength to keep on going. All i've known my life was pain and general misery. I naturally think of cops as my enemies because my mom brainwashed me so well.

I'm just.... hopeless at this point. I see no future for myself even though i've tried to carve my own... I just cant do it anymore. Now i'm in an awkward position. Too much of a pussy to off myself and too depressed to succeed in life. I'm so strongly independant and do everything for myself but I seriously need help, Counsleing, safety, acceptance.... I mean all these things happen to me but the only thing I even care about? Being trans.  But yeah... please help if possible.

after several months she told me that she had been born male and had transitioned long before I met her.

I've got zero interest in transexuals, men, bisexuality, or anything else...but I love her.  I am not church going or religious, but I do tend to be socially conservative.  Not ""protesting gay marriage"" conservative, but ""small towns with married folks and kids make nice neighborhoods, let's wave to the librarians on their lunch breaks and the guys at the VFW"" kind of conservative.

I feel like I've fallen down the rabbit hole.

I've googled and googled for information, but everything I can find is either guys looking for preops, or postops discussing how hard it is to have relationships.

does anyone have pointers to essays on the topic of what should a regular guy think of a situation like this?

does love conquer all?

I didn't say, wow attractive- I DID say, oh, wait, that's me. I suddenly felt a flash of connection to my body that I haven't had as long as i can remember. 

I don't WANT to be a man in a man's body; i don't want to be all one thing or another. I LIKE being in the middle. I LIKE being some of one and the other. But... if this makes me feel like me... I have to follow up on that, don't i? My doc says, ""Float to where it feels neutral to you again."" 

So i've made an appointment to cut off my long hair- a men's haircut, for real. And i bought myself a for-reals binding vest and a good tie, in support of my options. I'm a little worried about what this will do- I have a male name already, and i'm job hunting (world's worst time to make changes.) But what else can i do? 

So that's where i'm at. I guess what i'm looking for is just to talk to others, because i'm out of touch with the local community, and struggling to rebalance my identity on my own has been... a bitch. 

Fortunately there's no partner to deal with- i stayed with someone up till 6 months ago who was furious at the idea i might not be traditionally female. I know, i know. It was part of why it didn't work out. So here i am, on my own, six months... and now i'm finding that i wasted a lot of time not being really me. I'm not thrilled that the balance has changed, but it has. 

Is it likely to change again in my lifetime? Does that happen a lot?

Beautiful
By
Sarah M.
 
I look at all the beautiful women around me,
While I seethe with jealous rage and envy,
It makes me cry that I can’t be like one of you,
I just want to be as normal as the sky is blue.
 
Do you believe me when I say I am a woman?
Not a she-man, a fag, a perv, or a dyke, but an honest girl?
All I ever wanted was to be beautiful,
Beautiful.
 
I look at you with your gorgeous curls,
Your coach bag, your earrings and pearls,
The belt tied around your waist,
Your coat accentuating your taste,
And I feel cheated, robbed of a life that I could live,
If only I had the strength to give.
 
Do you know how lucky you are?
How beautiful you look from afar?
It’s all a transgirl like me ever wanted,
 
To look, to feel, to pass as a female.
To get looks from the guys and comments from the girls,
To strut my stuff all around the world.
To wear makeup and jewels, clothes that brighten a girl.
 
I want the privilege you cis-genders have,
Taken for granted, like everything else,
I struggle to walk out that door everyday
To face a world that’s chaotic and gray.
 
Did I make the right choice? I believe I did,
But affirming my existence to you is like winning a lottery bid,
Scary, far-seeming, and impossible to a naked eye.
Would it be better, if I just withered off and died?
 
I beg of you to see the women inside of me,
Just wanting, begging to be free.
I look at you and I see Aphrodite,
In each and every women I see.
Why can’t you believe me?
 
I just want a hug, a kiss, a shake of the hand,
To feel like a human again,
Instead of a freak shunned by nature,
Living in-between two genders,
A mind-fuck of a bender.
 
I just want to be as beautiful as you are,
I just want to love as you can,
I just want to affirm my right to exist.
Would you believe me?
Would you accept me?

I hope you all can help me.",Falodir,21,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1jvol2/so_so_so_so_so_i_have_many_questions_concerns_and/,"FIRST! My story. Probably a wall of text blah blahblah, but I think it has a lot to do with my current mental state, so if you read it all, there will be much love bestowed across my interwebs to yours. 

So I am a guy. Have been for the vast majority of my existence. I never really sank into that ""alpha"" mindset, though. I've been the quiet guy. The shy guy. The skinny guy. The guy who doesn't chase women. The guy who just sat in the middle of everything watching life happen.

I've had trouble feeling comfortable with my gender as a male for some time. It took a long time for me to realise it. The discomfort started, I feel, back when I was a young teen. The way that everyone around me developed and I... didn't. Not in so many words. I went through puberty, yes, but I didn't really develop. I don't know. Maybe it's because I spent so much of my time playing online RPGs and roleplaying... usually exclusively as female characters. I think I'm a pretty good roleplayer. I still RP online a whole bunch. For the past 9 years, I've gotten very talented as sitting myself into this character mindset, and making something realistic and memorable.

Maybe that has something to do with it. So, basically, I get into a long term relationship with a girl. Gorgeous girl. Funny, smart, cute, and totally opposite to me in a lot of ways. We were a great match. Relationship progresses, we get kinky. I've had a lot of kinks, but things delve towards pegging and other such activities. Rather fun. My attention is drawn to pornography and literature attached to these, delving into the domination aspects too. Very sexy. This slowly progresses to transgender pornography too, replacing the woman wearing a dildo to a woman with a penis. Again, pretty sexy to me.

My long term relationship fizzled out at some point. Mutual family issues. I loved her. I still love her. Time helps.

I think I became somewhat... fascinated, however, with the women in the porn. Many of these women were gorgeous. Incredibly so. And I lusted for them. In a way. I think I rationalised it as lust. Looking back, I think it corresponds more to envy. It was less that I wanted to be with these women... I wanted to *be* these women. It was a strange revelation. Oddly liberating. It came at a time when I was feeling very vulnerable. I had a breakdown of depression around Christmas, and my life started to collapse, held up from failure by my family and friends. My support network was, thankfully, incredible.

So while I was feeling vulnerable and depressed and weak and hopeless, something seemed to click. I started to realise that I felt so uncomfortable in my body. That it was wrong. That I wasn't what I expected myself to be.

I experimented a little with crossdressing. For a while, I found it irresistibly erotic, but that passed. It started to feel very natural. Putting myself in this new mindset... it felt very right.

And that is kind of where I am now. So I have questions, if you made it through.

1. How do I know if I want to transition? Maybe I could phrase it better... How do I know if it's *right* for me to transition? I've always kind of... toed the line between what is expected of me, but this would be a little more involved.

2. How would I tell friends and family? I have numerous friends who would likely accept me without another thought. And family too. But I have some worries. My father is a pretty gay friendly guy, as it goes. He has many gay friends and has no bashfulness about those issues. But there have been times where he has shown to be somewhat homophobic, generally around his less than PC friends. A lot of this doesn't bother, or apply to be (as I will go into) but even if my father was fine with it, I feel as though he would feel the need to tread on eggshells around me. Following on from that...

3. How would I define my sexual preference? I mean... I lean heavily towards the feminine form. Females, natural or otherwise generally do it for me, with a select few males. As a guy, I could throw around all sorts of terms, but things break down as I try and wrap my head around things as I go further. Halp plox?

4. What is involved? I mean, I know some basics... but I realyl don't know what the whole steps would be. How far I would go, or... just... everything. It seems like a overwhelming amount of things to do to overhaul your being.

5. I'm worried about passing. I'm pretty slim and neutral, physically, but there are a few worries. My shoulders are... relatively broad. Not hugely so, but I feel as though they would be a distinct giveaway. In addition, I don't know if my face would be a good candidate for transition, too. And then there's my voice. While I don't have a particularly deep voice (it can be quiet nasal) I have a kind of range 'gap' in the pitch where I would probably feel a feminine voice should lie.

So, basically I am kind of crazy confused about my gender, and have done my best to arrange my thoughts. I really hope you guys can help, and if you can, I thank you so much in advance! If you can't help, but read the whole thing, thank you for doing so. It means a lot to me. If you didn't read and can't help, but post anyway, I'm not sure why you posted, but whatever I am sure I love you anyway!

Everyone else seems to transition and really start to enjoy life and be who they are, I transitioned and within a year I had no life, no friends, no job, nothing.

I hate my body and instead of HRT making me feel more feminine and better about my physical appearance, it’s just made me feel worse, my skin isn’t any softer than it was pre HRT, now it just dries out a lot quicker, I haven’t had any fat redistribution, my body looks just as manly as it did before, everyone talks about their hair on their body thinning and growing more slowly, mine hasn’t changed at all, in fact I can’t shave or wax my legs because my legs end up being covered with ingrown hairs. When I wax, within 2 weeks I’ll have hundreds of little hair spirals underneath the skin that if I don’t dig out become infected sores, when I shave, I get a rash about a day afterwards that lasts for a week and then I have hundreds of inflamed bumps where the hair has gotten stuck under the skin, these too if not dug out leave me with infected sores. My legs are scarred so badly from this that when I see them I want to cry. I’ve tried everything for this, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 blade razors, different shaving gels and creams, hair removal creams, alpha hydroxy acids, heavy exfoliation, everything.

I started laser on my legs 2 years ago, I got 2 sessions done on my thighs and then lost my job, since then it’s been a struggle to just stay on HRT which I basically had to stop for a year.

I wonder sometimes why my body hates me so much, not only does my consciousness not fit with it but it is unwilling to play nice and make it any easier on me.

Once the meds I have are finished I don’t even know if I’m going be able to carry on HRT anymore (never mind ever getting SRS), I don’t know if I’ll have found another job by then, I’ve been unemployed for 16 months over the last two years and Tuesday would make it a year since I got fired from my last job.

I am a self-conscious wreck most of the time, my body dysphoria is constant and never ending, I have no confidence, I'm embarrassed of the way I look, I just can’t take it anymore.
The only way I can really describe it is that I feel disgusting, I feel disgusting in this body, I can actually without a doubt say I was happier before I transitioned.

The few people who do still chat to me say I deserve some good in my life but it just never happens no matter how hard I try and make it happen all my hopes, aspirations and attempts are crushed time and time again, I’m so sick of this being the norm, so sick of always feeling like this, feeling like I can’t talk to anyone about it because it never changes or gets better and people are just plain sick of hearing my shit.

1373996470.0,19,self.asktransgender,1ifd4l,Dysphoria Mostly Gone...,apw01,24,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1ifd4l/dysphoria_mostly_gone/,"So, I've been on hormones for awhile now, like half a year, depending on whether you consider a low dose of AAs or E the starting point. Anyway, I love being on HRT! But that isn't why I'm writing this post...

The effects I've gotten from HRT have been subtle and though not hugely physically effective yet, have definitely been enjoyed, and the mental effects are great too. But, so good in fact that the amount of dysphoria I once experienced about my gender has mostly faded. Despite the fact that I'm not even part-time yet, and still in this (albeit quite andro) boy-mode.

Do I want to stop HRT? No, I love it, and its effects (though breast growth is starting to become quite noticeable which presents a future issue for my boy-mode.)

But I feel kind of anxious about this positive change because I feel like I'm only partially through transition but I've lost a lot of the ambition. I just feel stalled, but it doesn't feel so awful. 

All this time I've been planning things out - stay on HRT for a year, then make a big jump to girl-mode and then take care of the legal stuff, all the while slowly making a few changes in the mean time. So now that I'm at this awkward point, (halfway to that planned girl-mode switch) it really makes me doubt my transition plans. I've been taking transition at an average if not slow, pace, though I'm happy with this pace. 

Now, I understand that it is definitely okay to be non-binary, or partially transition, or something like that - but part of me almost doesn't want that to be true for me. Though I still have my doubts.

So I guess I'm asking - is this kind of a thing not all that uncommon in some MtF transitions? Or should I take this perhaps as a hint to reconsider my transition plans? Or even identity? When I was younger, I did ID as MtF - but couldn't really do anything about it due to living circumstances, then I got older, moved out, and met other transitioners. Its awful but, this particular circle of transitioners whom I met made me feel less valid as a transwoman because I wasn't near-suicidal with dysphoria, and I didn't feel the need to rush forward with transition as they did, I just wasn't there yet. So as a result of that I started IDing as genderqueer/fluid for awhile. Then I started reading more trans literature and resources and realized that what they had said was wrong and there is in fact ""no one right way to be trans,"" and that other narratives, experiences and feelings are just as valid. So, I started IDing as MtF again and decided to transition. But at this juncture in my transition I'm starting to wonder if perhaps that non-binary kind of ID fit me better. 

Give me that ""desert island scenario,"" and I'd say yes, I identify as a woman. But as I mentioned with my dysphoria having mostly faded since HRT - it just makes me doubt my identity even more. Especially since I see so many transitioners around my point in transition just super anxious to make that jump to girl-mode or at least part-time, and I don't quite feel as much of that drive anymore, or at least at this point in time. I do still feel a bit of pressure to move forward, but it isn't the same. I feel like if I had to, I wouldn't exactly be miserable where I am right now if I could stay on HRT. I'm just getting really tired of dealing with trans stuff, its been a mental preoccupation for years and I'm almost just sick of dealing with it, sick of it always being on my mind. 

Its a tough place to be, and I guess I'm just asking if anyone else experienced this, or is experiencing it, and perhaps for some insight on identity and transition choices. ",,False,,t5_2r4b9,False,,,True,t3_1ifd4l,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1ifd4l/dysphoria_mostly_gone/,

ive always kept clear from the LGBT stuff.  ive always thought transgender to be a choice and that it only happens to people who give in to their physical and carnal desires.  i always bought in to the bad stigma attached to the label, that for some reason trans people just wanted the attention or didn't know what they were doing, or especially the most popular, they don't know God and thats why.  I have a strong faith in God, but have stopped going for the past year or two, due to issues with my church and to my anxiety.

Well, i stumbled onto the reddit trans scene last night, and for some reason I felt a huge connection.  After much reading, I have started to ask myself if I am trans.  

All of my symptoms and issues that I endured seem like I may in fact be transgendered, which shocks me, because I have always been wary of transgendered people (unrightfully so).  I've always thought that I was just ""girly""  or ""emotional"" or even ""nonsexual"" because of all the differences in thinking that I share with other guys.  My personality type is an INFJ, if that matters.

I am not really sure what to do right now.  I feel like maybe this is just a phase, and if I don't think about it then it will go away.  Or maybe if I start going back to church something will change.  But in my gut, I feel like this feeling would stay.  The most realistic thing would to just force myself to live my life out as a man, and accept that it was what I was born with. My main fear is obviously the world doesn't readily accept trans people, and  I feel many Christians do not as well (specifically my parents).  What should I do now?

Anyway, I make it clear that living in boymode is really taking it's toll, and that I really want to start HRT asap. She goes through the standard questions you would expect, including 

""When you were very little, do you remember having any feminine urges? Did you ever dress up in girls clothes or anything like that?"" 

""I had the occasional thought, but I never acted on it. I tended to repress those urges.""

""What about later, around Middle School, did you have feelings then?""

""Same thing: I had the feelings every once in a while, but whenever I did, I would repress them and overcompensate with stuff like football.""

She then expressed her worry about me not fitting the ""traditional trans experience"".

Long story short for many, many years i've actually ""acquired"" my feminine side and ""acquired"" the idea that i am a woman. I feel it is me through and through and am about to take major steps in the start of my transition. 

But the strange thing is, i have no idea what it means to be a woman and my ""masculine"" side is still around. Some rare days I'll feel a sense dread as think ""I am a man, stop kidding your self"" But the next day it all goes away and i love the female inside of me as before again..

I can't do this. What am I thinking? Is this really about gender, or is it a gross misapplication of my life energy having no other place but to turn back upon itself?

My ex-wife knows well of my tendency to flip back and forth along the gender spectrum. Forward is forward until it becomes backward. Then forward again. Like stumbling through a hedge maze in the dead of night. Though at least HRT has provided me with a candle in the darkness.

The golden veil of testosterone has been lifted, revealing the flaws of my prior self-assessments. Who am I kidding? I do not, and never have, looked like a woman. Rather, I look like a male who looks decent ""as"" one. Truly passing will require extensive surgery on my face and body. Not to mention training my voice to sound acceptable. Will I care to keep up with the routine, day after day? I have doubts.

You see, I am not a woman. Never said I was one. I only said I need many of the things woman-ness bestows. Being perceived as female opens doors... doors I am comfortable with. My spirit is predominantly female (or whatever ""female"" means in this social context). But my daily reality is shaped by how I am perceived. I am lost in a feedback loop of seven billion living mirrors who constantly affirm how I appear to them... male... with all of the usual cultural assumptions in tow. Impossible to reconcile.

Even if I woke up a beautiful woman tomorrow morning, what would be gained? Just another set of responsibilities and expectations. Actually, more. Make that MANY more as a full-time transwoman. Is transitioning truly necessary? Or is it simply the best option on the table? 

Perhaps the problem is with the table itself.

My life is most rewarding when I am not preoccupied with insecurities and desires. Even matters of gender do not preoccupy my thoughts when I am ""most actualized"". This is what tells me my gender issues are only part of an even larger more complicated reality yet to be revealed. But until I know how to proceed... the flippancy shall continue. 

And so... I choose to pass the lens back to testosterone but will nevertheless continue with electrolysis on my face. A conflict of interest? No. Only another stage until life can accommodate all of me/us. Whatever that will be.

Her response has me really quite puzzled: ""While i don't agree with your choice, i respect your decision as a person"" and went on to agree that im the person inside (she used the term soul) and that what i look like on the outside doesn't really matter.

I'm just lost for words, I've met people who've shouted and screamed, verbally abused me, told me i have a mental disorder, had people say im really just gay looking for an easy way out (i lol'd quite hard at that one) and those that have looked at me like a freak then say ""err whatever man"" and never said anything to me again.

But this response has me puzzled in a big way. what the hell does it even mean? i just don't get it, she's been off with me ever since and i can get it if she was just 100% against it and wanted nothing to do with me, but obviously something is there otherwise she would've either outright accepted it and gotten on with our friendship or walked away.

What do i do??? what does it mean? I want to ask her, but i don't want to offend her by questioning her religion or anything.

I've even posted here a few times. For those six months, I've been experimenting, and I have a pile of data that I'm having difficulty making sense of:

* I like women's clothes. Skirts especially, but almost anything that suits me properly is awesome.
* I like long hair styled in a fairly traditionally 'cute' and feminine way.
* I don't like body hair, especially on my chest and face.
* I like to behave in feminine ways most of the time (and by that I mean what is feminine to me). Not 100%, but the overwhelming majority of the time. 
* I still prefer women romantically and sexually, but increasingly I wish I could get around that and be able to be ""one of the girls"" socially. A female co-worker asked what I do with my hair (it's long and wavy, and if I do say so, quite nice) and it made my day.
* I haven't been able to get a name to fit. I've tried a couple, and while I like being called them, they don't feel like ""mine"". Being called 'Miss &lt;lastname&gt;' or even 'Miss &lt;birthname&gt;' were both nice.
* I've been considerably happier when I've experimented, and down when I haven't, but there's no sense of attribution; I don't feel like I'm happier *because* I'm experimenting, it just seems to follow.
* If I had a 'magic button' that would allow me to have a fully-functional female body and not have to adjust, relearn, or deal with attitudes towards trans folk, I would press it most days.
* That said, I have little interest in surgery, and when I get out of just fantasizing about it, the idea of having a female body is...difficult to process.
* Every time I go to pursue the possibility of hormones, I find myself dragging my feet to a ridiculous degree.
* While I like a lot of things - being shaved, especially - I find that the luster fades off them after a few months. They're still nice, but not the euphoria I felt at first, and I often find myself skipping the effort unless I really feel the need to be particularly feminine that day.
* My desires seem to fluctuate based on mood. When I'm down, I feel a much stronger need to ""girl out"" than when I'm happy otherwise.
* I'm still insanely nervous about any public presentation. In fact, I went out cross-dressed early in my experimentation without any real issue, but it's actually more difficult now. I feel more exposed, since it's not ""I'm a dude and I can wear a skirt, deal with it"" so much as ""oh shit I'm displaying waaaaay too much of myself here"".
* I don't seem to have a strong sense of 'male' or 'female' so much as 'masculine' or 'feminine'. I certainly seem to prefer the latter when I'm in a position to act freely, though.

In addition to having difficulty making any sense of my feelings, I have a few ideological conflicts that I'm trying to work out:

* If being male or female is biologically encoded, as is suggested by at least one study and generally accepted by the trans community, what is the explanation for non-binary identities? If it isn't, then on what basis can I insist (as opposed to request) equal treatment from others?
* I've heard plenty of stories within the trans community about gatekeeping. If I do pursue moving forward, how can I know the difference between someone who is resistant to me pursuing transition at all and someone who thinks I'm legitimately on the wrong path, or between someone who is accepting and someone who subscribes to ""if you're asking the question, you're trans"".
