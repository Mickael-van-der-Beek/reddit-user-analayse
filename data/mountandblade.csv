1375501538.0,95,self.mountandblade,1jlx34,"On the topic of ""boob armor"" and other related female armor issues.",bigsol81,126,31,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/1jlx34/on_the_topic_of_boob_armor_and_other_related/,"Maybe it's a case of confirmation bias or because I've only recently returned to playing M&amp;B, but between Reddit, TaleWorlds, and the Nexus forums, I've seen numerous debates pop up over ""female"" armor, and I decided I'd see about trying to put the matter to rest.

**Boob armor is impractical.**

First, in order for armor to fully accentuate the female form, it essentially has to hug the figure like a corset. While that sort of thing would work for armor made of flexible materials like leather, it wouldn't work so well for chain or plate armor. Your chest needs to expand so you can breathe, and you don't want the armor pressed right against you anyway, because it would transfer shock to your flesh and cause serious injury even if it did stop enemy weapons.

Second, a breastplate with separate indentations for each breast would be a huge risk to the wearer. Plate armor is primarily designed to deflect attacks, not absorb them, and putting a ""valley"" right over your heart is pretty suicidal, as it would essentially redirect attacks right into the center of your chest. Also, that hard steel ridge in the center could do some serious damage if you fell off of a horse, or took a solid blow to the chest from a sledgehammer or other blunt object.

**But it would distract men to see my female form!**

I can assure you that if you're charging at a man with a spear or a sword intending to murder him, you could be Megan-fucking-Fox charging buck naked through a storm of glistening raindrops and few men would hesitate to cleave you in two, because nobody's going to be ogling you when they're fearing for their lives.

Your pretty, form-revealing armor might save your life in another way, though. Your enemies might be more interested in capturing you alive so they can spend the next few days or weeks passing you around the campfire.

**So, when** ***is*** **it feasible?**

I will give many of the female armor supporters one thing: Calradia's not like Earth. Women are capable of equaling men in physical prowess, so it's not entirely impossible to believe that more suits of armor tailor made for women might exist.

But what would it look like?

Well, it certainly would not look like [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hLkgswP1Xv0/SL8kMFTVlII/AAAAAAAAA8I/K1tB-x-vLbE/s400/female%2Barmor.jpg), or [this](http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/12/female-armor.jpg), or especially [this](https://dviw3bl0enbyw.cloudfront.net/uploads/forum_attachment/file/67121/20110609000111632.jpg). There are, however, examples of armor made for women that has been proven to, at least, allow for improved comfort for women that are well-endowed.

[This](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/044/6/2/female_armor_by_golentan-d39ic16.jpg) is an example of armor a woman might wear. It provides increased room in the chest without sacrificing protection.

[This](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8oh_I-jTAdY/UOwafCcuW-I/AAAAAAAAZJk/DA-T8x9QEnM/w395-h583-no/tumblr_m28rerx6mP1rty7tao1_400.jpg) is another example. Again, slightly more room is afforded up top, but the overall shape of the breastplate is only slightly modified.

[This](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4PSEBaO5t6k/UOwaa2RBxPI/AAAAAAAAZJw/TOQrISL9Q9s/w374-h820-no/IMG_0372%255B1%255D.jpg) is probably the most extreme example you'll find that's still realistic (though she would likely be wearing mail under it, not just quilted padding), which we know allows her to move because she actually wears it when performing mock combat with rattan weapons. You'll notice, of course, that there are no ""boobs"" on the armor itself.

Honestly, [this](http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k4/KorpiklaaniKid/tumblr_mhz3ohFUGc1rcq9lto1_500_zps7c1549b8.jpg), [this](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1alhfw3sE1qh3x1zo1_1280.jpg), and [this](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ttdi93y4lRc/UOwkGUNtWVI/AAAAAAAAZLk/RcVkKsdsV-I/w351-h598-no/Snow-White-Armor-05%255B1%255D.jpg) are what you're going to see when it comes to ""realistic armor"" for women, since, with very few exceptions, there aren't many women out there that are well-enough endowed that they would need their armor expanded.

**What about ceremonial / dress armor?**

*This* is about the only time where something like boob armor could (but likely wouldn't) be seen. It would be armor meant to show off ones' wealth, not provide actual protection in combat, and there are historical examples of nobles and kings doing exactly this. King Henry VIII had an exaggerated metal penis in his armor, and many other wealthy nobles during Roman and Greek antiquity had armor custom-made to fit their forms, and these armors were often shiny, engraved, polished, and decorated in elaborate ways.

However, as I pointed out, such armors would likely be more of a liability than a protective feature, so if they were added to the game, I would expect them to be unusually heavy, have low protective value, very high cost, and likely come with some kind of skill penalties as well.

So, in closing, while it doesn't take a huge stretch of the imagination to agree that it's feasible that a somewhat eccentric, wealthy, self-centered noblewoman might wear armor like [this](http://www.freakygaming.com/gallery/concept_art/age_of_conan:_hyborian_adventures/female_sexy_armour.jpg) in a parade or while addressing her subjects, it's incredibly unlikely that she would even set foot on the battlefield wearing it.",,False,self,t5_2qzpd,False,,merc,True,t3_1jlx34,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/1jlx34/on_the_topic_of_boob_armor_and_other_related/,

During those 200 days, I only ended up getting one village. Fed up, I swore fealty to the claimant of the Nords. I thought I was going to have a successful rebellion, but all the lords that I expected to join me refused. 

So, I did the next best thing and I found the easiest to take over town : Suno. It only had a garrison of about 50 guys. Being that all my troops were Nord Infantry, I made quick work of the town. However, soon after I took the town and established a court the Nords raised a siege. At this point, I had only 30 troops vs. 100 enemy troops. All of the other Nord armies were raiding my villages. I quickly sent my diplomat to go arrange a peace deal: I forfeit my independence and I would have to make my way to the Nord king to swear fealty again. 

After I sent the diplomat, the town was assaulted. I survived the battle with only 15 troops left. Soon after the battle for Suno was over, ALL of the Nord armies that had been raiding my villages came to siege my town. I had approximately 700 troops sieging my town with only 15 troops in it. I was biting my nails for five minutes, and then the peace deal went through. I swore fealty to the Nords and everything is peachy now. However, I was one minute away from losing everything.

Thank god...

As with any subreddit read the side bar ect. ect. As most of you will probably start with Warband I suggest you download Floris as it is the most similar to the native (original) gameplay. In single player you're going to want to go around to all the villages recuiting as many people as possible. When fully upgraded, Swadians have the best horseback units (Sarranid Sultanate comes in close second), Nords have the best footmen, and the Vaegirs have the best archers. Your best bet is to get enough renown to join a kingdom as a vassel. Starting your own kingdom is hard, but if you try make sure you have lots of Right to Rule which you get whenever the faction you're with declares peace. For multiplayer, watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZZnl09qBKM&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL) and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9jHcZjWw9U).

But as i was playing the ACoK mod, it occurred to me that the 'villains' of ASoIaF, such as Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Amory Lorch, are quite limited by the game as to how nasty they can be, despite the fact that they were quite evil in the books. Dwelling on this, I thought it would be interesting if, in the next M&amp;B game, they gave the player some options to be really nasty in how the play the game. A few things I thought of were:

- The ability to kill other Noblemen. This is something that has been brought up a few times for the older M&amp;B games too, and has always been something I wish my 'evil' characters could do. For older games, I understand that Lords cannot be killed, due to the way they are programmed, but I always thought it would be an interesting feature that, if you captured an enemy lord after a battle, you could then be given the option to behead them, as opposed to simply imprisoning them. This would lead to some possible severe relationship gains/losses between your character  and the other nobility, but it would be great for RP purposes. 

- The ability to raze villages/towns/castles. I have seen that one of the features purported to be in the next game is the ability to build and modify castles, towns and villages within the game. I don't think this has been confirmed, but if it is a part of the game, then another feature I would love to see is that, once you conquer an enemy holding, you can put it to the torch and destroy it for good. 

- The ability to use gained controversy as a means to intimidate other noblemen. In the current game, if you have a lot of persuasion, you can convince lords to do your bidding, to an extent. In the next game, I think it would be interesting if, once you had gained a large amount of controversy (from all that beheading and torching) you could use that to buff up your persuasion skill. For example, speaking to another noblemen whose nation you are at war with, you might say: ""You should join my side, because if your side loses I will behead you and will burn your holdings to the ground.""

Anyway, these were just somethings I was thinking about. Cheers.",,False,self,t5_2qzpd,False,,reddit,True,t3_1h7d8b,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/1h7d8b/a_few_thoughts_on_mb_ii_bannerlord/,

Make it a preset, just like with the ""realistic no-save"" mode. Your character can die too, and if that happens and you're also playing no save mode then that's it, you're ""retired"" from adventuring, though both no save and dying would be optional beforehand. This would be the same way with other lords and kings. Axe blow to the head? You're finished. Brytenwalda also has an execution option for captured lords that's pretty cool. Of course with this, there may be heirs if the king dies, so his son would get it, and perhaps if he has two sons that hate each other they'd split and fight each other, possibly. If the heirs died, then maybe the most liked, or most powerful lord of that realm would then be king. Dying on the field would definitely be rare, so that the game isn't a cluster fuck of lords being killed off, and there'd have to be some sort of title system worked in, but I believe it could work. Warband (and a few mods) is my favorite game, but I imagine it would be more immersive if your favorite companion was cut down in battle beside you, or if the king who loves you does and his son that hates your guts takes over. I imagine everyone else has ideas for what they'd like to see so let's hear them.

In this post I want to hear your general thoughts about the new Mount and Blade. What do you want to see and what do you not want to see.

Personally I want to have a more advanced commanding system. Don't get me wrong, I loved the old system but they could maybe add more advanced commands so you can feel more in control about how your army behaves.

They could perhaps have a setup before the battle where you can set-up where your units shall be placed, for example in which order and how far away from each other etc. 

Or you could have like an pause option where you can pause the game in mid-combat and command your units. Cause I feel like I have about 20 seconds before their army reach mine to setup my army and after that it's pretty hard to do effective commands while everyone fighting each other and you are being chased and getting fired upon. 

Steam workshop support would also be nice considering all the awesome mods for the original M&amp;B like Anno Domini 1257 and graphic enhancement.

I would also love to see more open maps to battle on, like a (almost)-completely flat battleground where you can stack up your archers and just see all the 300 arrows fly and impaling the enemy troops. Cause I really don't like the forest-ish maps with hills, cause you have to take your whole army and get over the hill and just when you get over the hill the enemy's army stands ready 10 meter in front of you.",,False,self,t5_2qzpd,1375232947.0,,swadia,True,t3_1jdxbq,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/1jdxbq/what_do_you_want_to_see_in_the_new_mount_and_blade/,

I actually laid out my idea of a perfect game a few years back, and this comes close enough to that description that it's spawned a few *Truman Show*-esque conspiracy theories in my head.

One problem.

I finally got around to courting a lady. It's going good. I'm playing it cool, letting her simmer while I go out and adventure, and she gets all antsy and sends someone out to find me. This poor peasant has to risk bandits and an entire other invading nation just to pass me a note like we're in medieval study hall.

So I go back, talk to her, and she's all, ""Hey, this other guy's all up in my grill,"" and naturally I'm all, ""Not cool."" So I go to find the guy, only to discover he's been taken prisoner by the invading nation.

***I'm pretty sure this solves our problem.***

My lady, though, she's apparently enough of a traditionalist that it's important I still fight this guy who hasn't seen the sun for a month while he tries to ward off three different types of malaria.

What are my options here? Do I really need to break him out of prison just so I can say, ""Oh yeah, when you get back home, put your helmet on and come back outside.""? If I wait around, will they release him? Can I just talk some sense into this woman who's already telling me about another guy I need to fight after I figure out her riddle of morality?

I can't be entirely upset here. Based on my real-life experience, the female AI in this game is spot-on.",,False,self,t5_2qzpd,False,,,True,t3_hc3qf,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/hc3qf/i_fear_mlady_may_be_a_bit_ahh_stupid/,

Personally, I hope to see a better graphics engine, better animations, and wider and less random maps, as well as introducing some actual tactics.

Though the biggest thing I hope to see is some actual story. Say what you will about Mount and Blade, I think we can all agree that there is basically no plot, story, characters, or any narrative. I want Calradia to feel unique and original, but I also want to keep a sense of mystery and wonder about it.

I want to visit castles perched high above waterfalls, or in the deep snowy peaks of Vaegir territory. I want cities to be big, and feel big. I want to see farms and outposts and all of the things you expect to find in a civilization. I want the maps to feel old, and be memorable. Too much of the game is copy-paste castles and cities. Have them be unique.

I want a better realization of Calradia. This place has been at war for hundreds of years. All of these people are claimants to the Imperial throne, and all want the other dead. They are carrying on their father's wars, as their fathers carried their grandfather's wars, and so on. The place should feel dark, it should feel like it is, has, and always will be at war.

I want a sense of urgency in the plot. Sure, I should be free to choose my own path, but there should be a clear goal if I so choose to take it. Do I phase into a current faction and settle as a lord to best help myself? Do I play general and carry a faction to victory? Do I usurp the throne of a faction and claim it for myself? Do I lead a peasant revolt to help the people? Do I declare myself the last true air to the Empire and take over Calradia?

All of these things are generally capable in the normal game, but there isn't a feeling that I am doing anything important, or that I am making a difference.

So yeah, I rambled... a lot. Still, I am curious to hear what others have too say. The M&amp;B community is not very homogeneous, and so they generally disagree and have different ideas and opinions.",,False,self,t5_2qzpd,False,,,True,t3_15j79c,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/15j79c/your_hopes_for_bannerlord/,

I don't know anything about M&amp;B2 but if it is in making, what are the things you think are must-have for it to be better than the M&amp;B:Warband?

I'll start by saying that I'm enjoying Floris a lot but there is much more room for improvement. This could be a long list but I'd just like to see what can we come up with and maybe one day some of these things get fixed :)

1. Garrison management. We need to be able to select more than one group of units. Mouse selection, drag and drop, customized groups (not just for orders but for selecting who joins you in battle, in which wave etc...)

2. UI. Floris improved the native UI (reports screen is good) but it is definitely something that has to be in the game by default.

3. Time sinks have to be removed. I mean, do we really have to search for ransom broker every time? We need things like sell all prisoners right away in the city or garrison screen. Also, transfer all prisoners/capture or release everyone would be nice, that way I don't have to break every mouse when playing with slavers.

4. Impact on the world. The ultimate goal is to have a kingdom (at least for me it is). That should stay complex in gameplay mechanics, but it should be made easier in management and overview mechanics. Sending emmisaries, managing fiefs, communication with vassals and similar stuff should be easy to do, maybe even from anywhere on the map - I don't want to return to Yalen every time I wan't to renew trade agreement with someone, for example.

5. Having more power over vassals. I feel more as a servant to other lords when I'm a marshal or a king. If I'm powerful, righteous and renowned king other people should be trying to be on my good side, not the other way around - I hate organizing feasts and balancing fiefs to lords so they don't get angry with me, all the while I'm conquering half the map without their help and they're getting all the fiefs and money.

6. Territory and city managing system like Medieval 2:Total War has (upgrades, different units, city guard, non-military units). Cities should be able to stand on their own and not need me to babysit them.

7. Non-military units should have their own slot in my party. Want to send a message to the marshal? You have to use one of your designated scouts, if he's killed you're screwed. You have a medic? Great, he won't die in a siege with a knife in his hand.

This is just off the top of my head, I'm sure you can think of many more things. Imagine what a great game it would be :)",,False,self,t5_2qzpd,False,,,True,t3_yr6o6,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/yr6o6/improvements_for_the_perfect_mb_game/,

Here are the three characters I'm currently running:

**Lady Luciana Dontalis**

A noblewoman in the strictest sense, though a fair ruler. Born to a fallen noble and forced to leave home to avoid the political extermination of her father's bloodline. She is highly intelligent and charismatic, but not much in the way of a warrior, preferring to lead her troops in battle while staying far enough from enemy blades to keep breathing, which is why she favors the crossbow or lance when she is forced to fight.

I try to play her as straight to the ""honorable knight/noble"" as I can, wearing fancy armor but no helmet so she can easily see the entire field, and so that her shouted commands are not muffled.

**Warlord Danalia Thalis**

A bloodthirsty Nordic warrior woman. Like her Nord brothers, she dislikes horses and refuses to ride one into battle, preferring to stomp the ground alongside her heavy infantry, charging into battle first and sometimes even being the first to fall in battle.

High power strike, iron flesh, and athletics. A raw, straight-forward warrior wielding a two-handed war axe and wearing the heaviest armor and helmet she can get hold of at the time.

**Sandwhisper**

Her true name is unknown, though she goes by other titles such as ""The Scourge of the Sarranid"" and ""The Bandit Queen."" Sandwhisper is a Sarranid brigand, dressed in golden robes and a turban to hide her face, she leads a band of mounted bandits against villages and caravans alike. Hated by the people of her homeland, she often has to retreat to other realms to find respite.

She's a typical cavalry fighter, but it's the gameplay I focus on most, pillaging villages and attacking caravans to make money.

They pissed me off pretty well and I engaged them in combat without thinking. Then I realize: 90 Nords vs 450 Swadians. Oh well, what's the worst thing that can happen?

Well, I was charging towards them when someone killed my horse with a single blow. I'm sure many of us just ride around slicing infantry, and that's when it hit me: I don't know how to play as a footman. 

I turn around, hack and slash at footmen and I managed to kill nobody when I saw that I'm almost dead and there are now just two Swads in front of me, I killed one and just when the other one was going to land the killing blow on me- my fellow Nord Skutilsveinr backstabs him. That was the single coolest moment of my M&amp;B life. I spent the rest of the battle following my Skutilsveinr bro and helping him. I dunno, M&amp;B was getting pretty monotonous lately and this was quite an extraordinary moment. From now on I fight without a horse. And I think I'm gonna have buckets of fun.

It is honour.

In my games, I run around for a long time with 10 companions and maybe 5-10 Swadian knights and kill bandits and do missions for lords. And always go into a tavern to see if there are any farmers that need help. And I never take money or other rewards for punishing criminals or saving villages - that way you gain honour. Also, always release any lord you capture, as it gains you honour.

Once you hit 50-70 honour, the honourable lords of Calradia will love you. Only recruit these men. Find them and persuade them to join you, and reject all others when they stop by your capitol to try to join you.

* If you equip two shields, the unused one goes on your back. If you wear one of the Rhodok's board shields on your back, you'll have full protection from missile weapons and some melee attacks from the back.

* During the initial charge, the AI doesn't put their shields up unless missile weapons are being fired at them. Thus, to get the most out of your missile troops against enemies with shields, hold fire until the enemy is at medium range. Once there, open fire for a devastating volley or three.

I saw the mod thread for it, but never really bothered to look at it because I didn't hear anyone talking about it so I just figured it wasn't worth playing. After playing it for about 49 hours over the past 2 days, I would say that it is absolutely worth checking out.

Big whoop, I was excited, it was my first ever successful siege. What's more, King Ragnar even let me keep it. However, as one would expect, within a day or two I've got a bunch of Swadian soldiers (316 in fact) outside my gates and only about 40 soldiers to hold them off. Unable to get assistance, I'm forced to defend my city while outnumbered about 8 to 1.

That's where shit got ridiculous.

By standing beside the top of the ramp and repeatedly jumping and swinging my sword over the corner of the wall like a baseball bat, I alone racked up over 150 kills. Home run after home run was scored as swadian corpses piled at the base of my castle walls, my men valiantly holding the tide back while I methodically played hopscotch cricket with the skulls of my enemies, my odd kangaroo-on-crack tactic meaning that 90% of the time the AI wasn't prepared to block my swings. When all was said and done, I'd lost 11 soldiers and my army had slain 316 enemies, and I myself had taken almost no damage at all (less than 10%).

Now, I understand that the defender always has the advantage even in real life, especially when choke points are concerned. The movie 300, while probably not 100% historically accurate, does tell a tale set in truth. But is it really supposed to be *that* easy, or am I exploiting the biggest bug in M&amp;B history?",,False,self,t5_2qzpd,False,,merc,True,t3_vdzpv,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/vdzpv/defending_against_sieges_is_it_really_this_easy/,

I started from scratch, using the base map as a guide line, but drawing all details in by hand, and trying to improve the general look and feel of the base map. I have currently finished the geography entirely (that includes placing terrain, hand editing edges and coast lines for smoothness), with the exception of the Swadians and the Rhodoks, which I plan on finishing tomorrow.

The only work left is placing settlements, and though I can do it alone, the work would go much faster with someone to help me. I could also use a tester, if anyone is interested.

1334645909.0,25,self.mountandblade,sdvn6,My all-female Mount and Blade run,eudaimonean,31,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/sdvn6/my_allfemale_mount_and_blade_run/,"So, I just got into Mount and Blade this week, and after doing a few starting characters to get a feel for the game I've decided to do something a little different, and do an all-female runthrough of the game. My character Andraste leads an all-female mercenary band, ""The Sisterhood,"" which currently wanders the land, meting out justice to looters, bandits, and rapists (all of whom are men in this world, hmmm...). Eventually, we will smash the patriarchal feudal power structures that oppress women. The long-term endgame will be to support one or both of the female claimants in the game who have been unjustly deposed by their misogynistic usurpers, and then possibly create a kingdom of my own. (I've never actually reached M&amp;B endgame so I have no idea if it's possible to do all three endgames.) Andraste's vision for the future is one in which all sexist power structures of male domination have been purged from the continent, and benevolent female leadership holds unquestioned authority from the Sarranid desert to the Nord coast.

I've running through the game with the following condition on myself: not a single Y chromosomes in the party, ever. This has a number of implications:

-Female heroes only. There are far more male heroes than female heroes, so I'll need to use a smaller number of heroes to cover a wider range of skills.

-It will be much more difficult for me keep my army up while campaigning, because I won't be able to free high-level prisoners and hire high-level mercenaries to quickly replenish my ranks when I take casualties.

-The female unit line is very fragile until fully upgraded to sword sisters.  That said, the high-level Sword Sister unit at the top of the female unit line is an excellent unit that comes recommended even in vanilla playthroughs, because they are Tier 5 cavalry at a Tier 4 price. I guess the wage gap exists in Mount and Blade too. Overall, the female unit line in Mount and Blade takes more work to develop and is risky but the end result is worth it. (Sort of like women in real life?) So I'll need to carefully protect and train my troops until they level up. 

I've also used the the Floris mod (with basic units). One of the handy things about Floris mod is that female mercenary units will be available for hire in taverns. I don't think this runthrough would be possible without this tweak, in vanilla I'd need to level up heroes only and then only get troops by freeing female peasants from raiders and peasants.

Thus far, The Sisterhood is a 45-woman strong band of tier 2-4 troops. Andraste met Ymira, who was fleeing an unwanted arranged marriage, and Matheld, whose brother-in-law usurped her property when her husband died. In their stories, Andraste saw the evil of men writ small, and hardened her resolve to smash the patriarchy. She immediately recruited them both, Ymira as a doctor and Matheld as a warrior. Eventually The Sisterhood also recruited Deshavi as a pathfinder and tracker, as well as Katrin, as quartermaster and assistant doctor. Andraste founded the Sisterhood in Nord lands, but the Sea Raiders (buffed in Floris Mod) are a bit too much for my fragile units so I'm making my way south to fight bandits instead. This is actually also my first Florid Mod runthrough so I'm hoping the bandits won't be too much for my band to handle...",,False,self,t5_2qzpd,False,,,True,t3_sdvn6,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/sdvn6/my_allfemale_mount_and_blade_run/,

For example, lances couch, which is deadly to anyone you then poke.  There's also hidden 'strange' equipment in Rivacheg and a couple of other cities.  You can promote your companions to Lords, and so on...

But today, I was in a tussle with some Khergits, and I accidentally hit Shift + M, which made my female player make a loud grunt and ""You whistle for your horse"" appear.  I had keyed M for messages, but now whenever I hit M I get a horse whistle, and my faithful hunter finds me.

Then I started hitting other buttons and B gives a message (in blue) that I'm bracing my lance for a charge, though no animation takes place. Then I accidentally tap W to move forward, and my character does a completely different forward attack.  

So, are these commonly known or am I just straight up crazy?

EDIT:  Next battle was a siege, and I tried to reproduce results.  Character would neither whistle nor brace lance.  I'm going to try to get into a normal battle next and get some pics.

Hey, I'm Jarvisimo and I'm project leader and founder of The Veiled Stars mod, which grows ever closer to completion.

I'm no fantastic modeller, and I could really use those who are experienced at modelling to help get it released faster!

Requirements:
1. An interest in the Lord of the Rings!
2. Good modelling/texturing skills, and ability to use Normal and Specular maps.
3. Friendliness. Our mod team of 4 people aren't just collaborating, we're also friends and like to have a laugh from time to time. 

Perks: 
1. You'll be in pride of place on the list of team members, and I'll sing your praises when you make models. Literally - I've promised Brego I'll write a song about him when we're done.
2. You'll get every uploaded alpha, beta, semi beta and pre alpha of the mod that is uploaded.
3. I'll love you forever.

If anyone's interested, I really do need some help - not desperately, but if you want to see the mod completed within the next two months, then get yourself on board our jolly ship of modding!

Thank you guys.

Who's interested?,Tartantyco,25,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/17sz6a/im_making_a_metagame_based_around_napoleonic_wars/,"The general idea is kind of like Total War where we make a board game-ish game based around Napoleonic Europe, although not historically accurate. Various factions fight for control of Europe on a detailed map from the 1800s where troop movement, economics, logistics, and so on take place. The ensuing battles then take place in Napoleonic Wars.

Though not historically accurate to equalize factions as much as possible, realism in terms of the logistics and economics of warfare and governance will be pursued.

**What needs to be done**

A comprehensive logistical and economical ruleset for the campaign needs to be made.

A ruleset for various things like retreats and army composition needs to be made for battles.

Logistical, military, economical, and historical information needs to be accumulated to base the rules and components of the game on.

As detailed maps of Europe around 1800-1810 need to be collected.

-----

**Campaign Ruleset**

Logistics: Rules for troop movement, supplies, infrastructural improvements, civilian logistics.

Military: Recruitment, maintenance, attrition, troop movement.

Armies: How armies on the campaign map translate to the battle.

Economy: Simplified national economy, resource locations, maintenance, infrastructural improvements.


Battle Ruleset:

Retreats

Player behavior

So I hatched a plan: I would journey into battle with a worthy foe, kill him, and take his horse! What could go wrong?

After much searching, I by chance got my large peasant army into battle with an army accompanied by some kind of lord, who rode a splendid steed indeed. Armoured, red cloth flowing from it's barding.

I made a beeline for the smug bastard, axe raised high above my head. I saw arrows flying over my head as I neared him. He was a bit of a pincushion when I got close, and with one fell swoop, I placed my axe firmly in his face. 

He fell hard from his horse, who very agreeably stood in place. I dismounted my donkey of a horse and strode towards the magnificent beast, intending to mount the hell out of him. As  got close, waiting for the ""Mount"" prompt, I was instead met with ""Insufficient riding skill.""

Damn it.

Not to be disheartened, I bravely fled the battle to find another worthy horse. I hastily placed two more points into my riding skill, and hunted for my next victim.

Happily, I chanced upon a battle between my allies and enemies. I joined, and quietly trotted around the back of the army, and assassinated the first person on a horse I found. Again, he fell from my prize, and I leapt from my horse, and beamed with joy when I finally sat atop my new horse, resplendent in his blue frock.

I continued to trot triumphantly in circles around the swirling melee in the centre of the battlefield, very pleased with myself and my fancy new horse. 

After the battle ended, I quickly charged into the nearest group of bandits, eager to run them through with my new-found pace and vigour- but much to my dismay, I stood on the battlefield, placed firmly upon my old donkey.

This fear hit the Nord kingdom the hardest as they relentlessly attacked driving our armies back to a standstill. I decided to gather my men and began a guerrilla offensive. However this ill-fated task was not to be completed. 

As I emptied out one of my two castles I received word that my other castle, Tilbaut was under siege. I made a beeline towards it, to join up with my other army garrisoned there. As I got there I realized the full extent of my woes. 704 nords were camped outside Tilbaut. Inside with my army we few, The Blood Legion, we numbered only 135. 

Two days later the battle started. I bid my men a fond farewell as I took my place to the left of the ladders. The battle was long and my legion earned their name over and over. We stood and we fought the invaders to a halt almost before a stray arrow took me out. Disheartened by the loss of their commander my men pushed the enemy back for a time. 

I assured them I could fight, and so managed my way back up to the ladders. We fought having halved their numbers in the first battle, while losing half our own. For hours we fought. However one wild-eyed Nord with blood on his ax broke through our ranks and delivered a savage chop that ended my role in the fight. The siege was not yet over although by now the enemy had lost near 600 men. I lost another twenty in that second fight, and only had thirty men left. 

Without their commander though, their morale and tactics suffered. The remaining two battles showed this as they killed a combined 35 men before being wiped out. 

As the invaders washed over the walls they slew all in their path before coming to the infirmary where I lay. The laughed, a harsh cruel noise and imprisoned me. For days I was nursed back to health, vengeance and hatred simmering away. 

As soon as I was able, I strangled the guards adopted their guise  and stole away into the night, making my way to Reyvadin where the Khan himself resided. 

Bidding him to cut short my vassalage, I explained my need for vengeance, and he understood, although was saddened to see me go, we had been great friends and he saw how this had changed me. 

As I left there, I vowed to not rest until the Nord had fallen completely. I traveled the lands offering my blade to those in need, many a farmer came to thank me as bandits were driven back. 

After a month of freelance work, I had found my old companions, Lezalit, Bayeshtur, Alayen, and Borcha. We decided between us to combat the Nords by reclaiming Tilbaut Castle.  
After it was left undefended we laid siege, before the fight could begin however, I managed to convince the defenders to lay down their arms. It worked the castle was ours and so began the first step to the destruction of the nords. 

Vindicta Aeterna - Vengeance Eternal we rose that day, and will never be beaten as we had one that fateful night.

Sorry if these are obvious, but it's new to me, I'm playing without looking at strategy guides or anything.

I'm playing Pendor and wanted to kill a huge independent army for the stat bonus you get for the achievement. Got owned every time I attempted a fair fight because they have like 30 units that have like 300 HP and can easily one-shot you, and another 50 that are weaker but still tougher than any of my units. No matter what strategy I followed, I got slaughtered. Then I got the idea to follow them until they attacked bandits, and jumped in to *aid* them. You control independent armies that happen to fight as allies, so I ordered them to stand still, and made sure I unloaded my whole quiver into their heads every round. After killing off their ~100 strongest warriors this way, I was able to fight them and win.

Another cheap but not cowardly thing I did was, in an impossible siege (extremely tight ladder, impossible to get through...Ravenstern), after 3 failed sieges, I ordered my units to stand still, ran up the ladder, and maneuvered to fall over the edge behind the defenders (the defenders left an opening, they only group up when several units attempt to go up the ladder). No one chased me, so I was able to walk back up the stairs, kill the archers, and snipe the defenders. Even when the reinforcements came, they ignored me (even as they walked right next to me) and went straight to the ladder. A couple of archers would still come to the side of the ladders, so I always had arrows available. I got ~200 kills that siege thanks to the crappy AI.

What cheap tricks do you pull to get the better of the game?

The disparity between troop types seems far too ridiculous, the costs for some things unreasonable, etc. However, after playing it for a while, I was able to get over this.

The thing that however has finally I think pushed it over the edge into unplayable for me is the size of the faction armies, how many lords there are, how fast every one of them rebuilds after defeat, and how close everything is together.

This screenshot is one example:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=150623098

I've literally been dealing with something like the above for 450 in game days straight in game. As soon as a war with one faction finally ends (they seem to go on for an eternity and a half), another one immediately starts and I get to do it all over again...then when that finishes it's back to the first faction again who's rebuilt completely.

In this screenshot, I own Ravenstern, though not for much longer obviously, but this has finally killed my desire to keep playing. I counted and this was I think 3650 or so troops attacking my town here (keep in mind this is after 400 of my own troops had been killed or wounded, so that's after their own casualties as well, they originally had more). I was on the other side of the game world when war was declared with this faction again, and by the time I got back (passed at least another 400 on the way back after killing 450 right at the war's outbreak), my town had already been besieged and the battle had gone on for a while. My original garrison was around 500+ troops, almost ENTIRELY top tier. The garrison alone was around 10k a week to pay with 25% pay reduction from leadership. Throw in my own party and I'm basically bankrupt despite having an enterprise in every city (which don't work half the time due to the aforementioned literally endless war). I cannot in any way shape or form afford to garrison anything I own even more than I had.

This is not the first situation like this either, I had a castle as well at one point, which was my main fief for a long time, lost it about 25-30 times, literally. If I took it back from them, a 2000+ man army showed up within 6 IN GAME HOURS every time (and I do mean EVERY time), the dust never even settled from the previous battle, and there is no way I could possibly fight the army. The only way I ended up getting anything in the end was to go and immediately take it back after they did and leave a garrison of 0, then just abuse my maxed pathfinding to hit as many things as possible doing this to every one of them to make them run back and forth and slowly whittle them down when they put some of their own troops in the garrisons. My own faction was useless, never saw more than 500 troops in any one group at any time really.

Beyond that, it also seemed the AI specifically targets the player's holdings. The most raided village in my kingdom was the one that I owned (which btw was in the very center of my kingdom, and the farthest from any borders...they'd have to pass up 8 or so villages, 2 towns, and at least 2 castles to hit my village). Once again previous statement of faction was useless applies, they'd never help drive anything out or defend.

TLDR: Prophesy of Pendor is a mod where you fight 5000 man armies single handedly that even if you kill them all come back in about 2 in game days at full strength.

Does anyone have any other good mods that are slightly more reasonable to suggest? As much as I like a lot of the aspects of this one, the experience described has killed any desire to play it further.",,False,self,t5_2qzpd,False,,sarranid,True,t3_1fph2y,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/1fph2y/prophesy_of_pendor_is_just_too_unreasonable/,

You dump all your current army into a garrison in a castle/town, then you go to one or two villages that like you and hope that they have quests for you.

I suppose cheap is good too**, depending on how much you're making weekly - money was no issue for me that game though.

We enjoyed it immensely. It's a welcome relief from the broken spamfest that is native, and the stressful bayonetfest that is napoleonic siege.

The Brits use highly accurate breech loaders that can be reloaded in about two seconds, whilst moving or on horseback. The Zulu's use crappy shields and awesome spear things that double as javelins. They move and attack fast.

Despite being far superior on paper the British usually have a hard time winning. If the Zulu's get into melee you will be mobbed and sliced into sausages. It's relatively easy to bayonet the lone Zulu, but more than that and you may as well give up.

The mod has lots of potential. The three servers all use AI bots for the Zulus, but you can join them yourself to give them a welcome hand. The models are a bit shitty at times, your troop options have big black masks over the face, so that you appear black, but your face clips through and makes you look daft as hell. The battlecries have been replaced, but the British ones are awful and the Zulu ones sound like they've been ripped straight from 60's films. On the whole though it's a solid distraction from the normal modules.

However, it isn't all sunshine. Most of the current players are pretty flipping shitty. They spawn as sappers, build barricades so that the AI Zulu's cant get into the buildings or encampent, then shoot them like fish in a barrel. If you go Zulu they will whine and moan, poll to kick you, act as if you are ""ruining their fun"" just by trying to make the teams balanced.

We joined yesterday and after a while decided to try Zulu to see what it was like. Aside from being really quite fun, we soon realised that if we didn't go Zulu the rounds would be mind numbingly dumb due to the blatant cheating showcased by everybody we played with.

We smashed their barricades with our rifle butts, letting our AI brethren in to muller them. We flanked their position and shot them from the windows they left unguarded. We gunned down their cavalry again and again and again. They moaned, they whined, they wept. I gunned down their entire team one round when they built their way onto a 2nd story house's roof and they wiped out the AI. They started to build forts into the sky, abusing the sapper buildings even further, rigging them with TNT so they could suicide rather than let us kill them when they were out of ammo.

They tried kicking us just for being better than them. They changed the map to make it easier for them. This morning a different group of scrubs made up a rule that you cant have more than three Zulu players at once. When we joined, even though we were the first onto the team, they polled to kick us, relentlessly, whilst moaning that we were ""ruining it"".

So I come to you reddit, and I ask you to install the mod, join a server and have fun with us. To help counter the endless shitters who hate a challenge, to make the mod as great as it was MEANT, nay, DESTINED to be!

2. What other mods do you recommend to the community?

3. What are some essential things a player should do in their M&amp;B career?

4. I'm looking for some good communities to play with but I'm having trouble finding some casual ones I can join from time to time any advice?

There was little noteworthy about him, at first, other than that he had a reasonable skill with a sword and shield. He wandered Calradia for a few days, before running out of money and deciding to join the army. He joined Conte Trimbau of the Rhodok Republic's force, enlisting as a Cittadino.

Rodion spent several months with Trimbau, gaining his favor and quite a few denars as he moved up the ranks in the army, eventually gaining the equipment and respect afforded to the elite Capitanos di Ventura, one of the highest tiers of infantry. He followed Trimbau on his campaigns with the Rhodok Republic, accompanying him to battles and feasts alike. At one of these feasts, the daughter of a certain powerful Rhodok lord named Gutlans caught his eye. Knowing that the daughter of the lord of Yalen would never marry a poor soldier, Rodion left Trimbau's army with fond farewells to the Conte and petitioned Doge Graveth for a lordship. Having fought together in several battles and sieges, the Doge was happy to acquiesce. Rodion was given the village of Serindiar, near Grunwalder Castle. 

Now a lord of his own, Rodion asked Gutlans for permission to court his daughter. Gutlans scoffed at him, pointing out that his daughter had several suitors much more respectable and wealthy than Rodion. 

This inspired Rodion to go to war, to earn lands and laurels that would make Gutlans respect him. Rodion raised a small army of elite, top tier troops. He went to Tihr, one of the great cities of the Nords, and in less than a day put its defenders to the sword. He defended it from the attempts to reclaim it, and was finally awarded it by Doge Graveth, who was impressed by his singlehanded capture of the city.

Now a successful conqueror, Rodion returned to Yalen to ask Gutlans for his daughter's hand. Gutlans was happy to oblige.

Newly married, Rodion quickly lost his taste for conquering. He traded away Tihr to another lord for Grunwalder Castle, then traveled Calradia for a few weeks, buying industries in almost every city. Financially secure, Rodion went to Doge Graveth and announced his secession from the Rhodok Republic. Doge Graveth was angered by the fact that Rodion refused to give up his lands, and denounced him. The Rhodok Republic went to war with the newly formed People's Democratic Republic of Grunwalder.

Unfortunately for the Rhodoks, the PDRG had a master military leader. Rodion captured Veluca and Jelkala in short order, but chose not to keep them for himself. Instead, he gave the cities away to the Kingdom of Nords and the Sarranid Sultanate to boost his diplomatic relations with these powerful nations. 

The next two years passed with Rodion defeating every attempt by the Rhodok Republic to attack his lands. Rodion eventually became very wealthy, from the income of his many industries and also from the rents he received from Serindiar and Grunwalder Castle, the only two fiefs in his tiny kingdom. The many ransoms for the lords he captured trying to raze his village didn't hurt, either. He stocked his castle with almost two hundred high tier crossbowmen and infantry, and also kept a standing army of a fluctuating number between 60 and 120 of high tier troops for defeating invaders. 

Many of the other Calradian nations have declared war on the PDRG, but none have managed to defeat Rodion in battle and Serindiar has only been razed one time in the two years it has been independent. Serindiar is now a very rich and happy village, especially when compared to the terrible poverty to which it was subjected under Rhodok rule.

Despite being arguably the most capable military leader in Calradia, Rodion never expanded his kingdom beyond Grunwalder Castle and Serindiar. In the ever changing political landscape of Calradia, the People's Democratic Republic of Grunwalder stands firm as a rock.

Ever since I started playing (a short while ago) I've gone with cavalry since I love horse archery and lancing people down (large rhodok lance in Floris is completely overpowered with 280 reach and 91 speed rating) and they seem to crush infantry pretty much always, and yes I play on max difficulty (except for automatic block it's all toughest settings). I've only really used infantry to man my fiefs. 

I play Floris (where my cav consists of C5/H5 and higher and slaver troops) and just started Prophesy of Pendor (so far only used the Young Nobles and their upgraded versions, and whatever cav I rescued). So am I missing out somehow by just using cavalry in the mods I listed (and native, though I don't play native anymore), or is cavalry just really overpowered?

The thing is, I really love the *idea* of infantry, but in practice each time I try to play as, say, Nords I seem to get far fewer kills, I also feel far more vulnerable and my troops seem to die more easily and be generally weaker whenever I use infantry/foot archer armies instead of cav.

I'm sure everyone here would tell me it is worth it to keep and not trade and I love RPGs and games that let me have minions so this game is a no brainer but I want some info.

1. If you could tell me one thing about this game before I unpack it, what would it be.

2. How is the level of customization in this game?

3. Is mod support as good as I've heard it is still? (and I'm assuming you can mod it in the Steam files, I'm not wrong am I)

4. What are the five mods that add a ton to the game?

5. Are graphics and performance mods available? (Yeah, I'm petty and like graphics, it won't be a deal breaker if there isn't but I'd hate to play with bad graphics if better is available)

6. Other comments/input

Having a 50 army and beating a 150 army for the first time was pretty amazing. (warband)
First time trying out fire and sword. Me and my 15ish army was going to kiev to deliver a letter or something. Suddenly from no where a group of 50 deserters attacked me. Standing there in the field and seeing this huge horse army rushing to me kinda made me panic so I ran the other way xD Hear something behind me turn around, sees a guy on a horse rushing towards me I quickly get my rifle up and shoot the horse. It feel like a meter infront of me. Switches to my hand gun and finish him. A sec later and I would be dead.
I lost the fight but man that shoot feelt so amazing.



Also a couple of questions about F&amp;S.
It turns out I can't train my army? What can I do to improve them buy weapons/armor at mercenary camps ? I bought guns for a group of my musketeers then when I recruited more they also got the guns? Because I can't seem to pick that one again.

Since it sounds like a pretty common question, I figured I'd post it:

1. Start in (or beside) Khergit Khanate. Also, put a couple points into the Pathfinding Skill when creating your character.

2. Accumulate a group of about 20 Khergit soldiers.

3. Join every tournament you can find, attack all bandits you see, ask every noble you see (from the kingdom you want to align with) what you can do for them, and when your soldiers are fairly experienced, loot every village (and attack every caravan) you can find belonging to an enemy of your chosen kingdom.

And an explanation of the above and why this makes things easy:

1. All Khergit soldiers, apart from the very first rank, are cavalry. This, along with pathfinding, makes you *very* fast on the world map, very early. Like, 7+ speed. This lets you outrun anything which is a threat to you, and run down anything which is a target. It makes it very easy to hunt down bandits for experience, and also lets you delve deep into enemy territory with little fear of being caught.

2. It doesn't sound like a lot, but 20 is all you need. You can level them up to Lancers on bandits and they will be very hard to kill. 20 soldiers is small enough that villagers don't flee when you loot their village, but large enough that you can slaughter them in the ensuing battle, so you can get good experience from looting this way. Having a small number of veteran soldiers also means you're often outnumbered, which gives you renown when you win. (Additionally, you can recruit a hero character in a tavern and level them up excessively in the medical skills, making it even harder for your soldiers to die)

3. You can out find where tournaments are taking place by asking the Tournament Master in the arena. You can make a lot of money by betting 100 denars on yourself at every round. Attacking bandits should be easy with your speedy group. Helping nobles gains you renown and improves your relations with your kingdom, and it's through doing this that you can get asked to become a mercenary and fight for the kingdom. This is great because you can then gain renown by attacking the enemy. As I said, your speed lets you go deep into enemy territory, which makes looting easier since armies are usually protecting the border lands. It also means you can run around looking for caravans and such.

Doing the above is the best way I've found so far to get renown reliably. Most quests that I know of give you +1 renown by the way, and looting gives you +5. I'm not sure about other values. I'm still relatively new to the game, so if anyone else has corrections or improvements, please post them!",,False,self,t5_2qzpd,False,,,True,t3_ira89,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/ira89/a_quick_start_guide_for_those_having_trouble/,

The purpose of this thread is as follows:

1. Identify what towns produce which goods.
2. Identify what industries work best in what towns.
3. Identify the best places to sell goods.
4. Identify average selling price of commodities for reference
5. Identify best places to buy items (Armor/Weapons/Horses)

Any information or input you can provide is welcome.  I'll update as info is provided and then take that info to update the wikis. Thanks!

Lets say that I want to start a Faction/Nation or whatever that hold only a single town + a few villages around then make a neat little trading nation, securing my and my vassals a hefty income to later build a strong military.

So my question, sorry for taking so long.

I select recruit troops and it just takes my money, it doesn't seem to add anyone to the castle.

So I run over there to check it out, warned en route to check in with my lord immediately. I find the prison guard, alone, but considerably better-equipped than I am. Since I can't figure out how to actually request to visit with a prisoner, I had no choice but to try to kill the guard and free my Konungr. 

The jailer screams for help, and turns to run. Unfortunately, he chose to run directly into a corner. I stabbed him with my angle sword at least five times before he remembered which end of his greatsword to use, and he fell shortly thereafter without even wounding me. I rushed into the cell, and saw my commander, frail from malnutrition. I thought that he would recognize me for the risk I took to save him (for my own ends, of course), but he only asked what was going on. I told him to fight, and we ran into the streets.

Unfortunately, there were about a dozen soldiers on the battlements by this point. I took off around the corner to a staircase to begin taking them out, and the Konungr stood still. I see ten guards pour out of some building on the far side of the battlements, three headed for me and the rest toward the staircase nearest Ragnar. I pull out my bow and begin sending arrows toward them, but two archers elsewhere on the battlements made that difficult. As I fell back behind the keep, I saw Ragnar, standing where I left him. I feared for his safety, but comforted myself with the knowledge that he was at least six times stronger a warrior than I.

Sure enough, as the three soldiers rounded the corner to confront me, the other seven reached Ragnar. Somehow, the Konungr had acquired a blade, and began to cut the soldiers down, each in a single blow. Shaken from his stupor by the thrill of battle, Ragnar surged up the stairs to slaughter those archers. Meanwhile, I'd only managed to kill one soldier and wound another, and my shield could not take more abuse. 

Trusting my Konungr to distract the archers, I leapt down onto the staircase, and pulled out my bow. As the guards filed down, I filled them with arrows, or at least their shields. But it was enough to break one guard's shield, and that was enough for my blade to break the rest of him. I heard the cries of a slain Vaegir and triumphant Nord as I sprinted to the other staircase, hoping to shoot the final guard in the back as he climbed after me.

Sadly, the guard was more athletic than I (and he in full mail, no less). He gained ground before I could reach the staircase, and I had no choice but to turn and fight. My Konungr was standing over the second archer, unmoving. I grew furious at him for not rushing to assist me, his finest and most devoted vikingr. No one else had dared break him out of prison. No one else had killed four times mrore Vaegir in every encounter than he had. And he would do nothing, and let me fall? 

No.

These thoughts occurred even amidst the parries and ripostes, which my trained mind could automatically perform. I would not let this Konungr rule me with no respect for my strength, nor would I let him watch me die. I dodged back, and saw an opening. I'd dodged the guard's greatsword, and for a moment his left side was exposed. In a flash of steel and blood, my blade sank through the mail and into the flesh, and the guard fell.

Within moments, I found myself outside conversing with Ragnar. He was very gracious for saving his life, but still said nothing of my rapidly-ending leave. I decided to ask him about it the instant we leave the castle, but he was nowhere to be found. He must have called upon Woden to return him home, and again left me to fend for myself. I headed home to Sargoth, hoping to reach it before sunset, when I will be declared a deserter for rescuing the Konungr. 

As luck would have it, no bandits assailed me along the way, and I reached Sargoth in the late afternoon. Ragnar was there, waiting in his cozy castle. I spoke to him, and he made no mention of my noble deed, but welcomed me back into his service. I immediately asked to retire, instead. I have no desire to serve this selfish Ragnar a moment longer. No, I've heard rumors of a man known as the Far-Seeker who seeks to rule over the Nords.

I'm *so* glad I did! Even though the sword is a good all-around weapon, there's way better ones out there. Here's a couple of my favorite.

1. **Awlpike**. What an amazing weapon! I was hesitant to give up my lance for a slightly shorter, non-couching spear at first, but this paid off tremendously. The awlpike is fast (90+ speed) and when you're charging in on a horse, it can do enough damage to one-shot about anyone. It also does piercing damage, so it will do even more damage to heavily armored opponents. Lances are overrated IMO; while they do huge couching damage (often 200+), that's way overkill even on the big, bad Kings who probably don't have more than 80 hp. With an awlpike, I can ride around killing enemies like I couched them with the added bonus of not having to work with the huge, *painfully slow* and unwieldy lance.

2. **Morningstar**. Another underrated weapon IMO. Like the Bastard Sword, it can be switched between 1H and 2H. Unlike the Bastard Sword, it does piercing damage (so again, more damage to heavily armored opponents) AND has Crush Block, which will crush right through an opponent's block (shield or parry) if you swing with enough momentum. The only downside is that it's unbalanced so you can't do feign attacks with it very well, but this is made up for by the big damage it deals. I pull this weapon out whenever I'm fighting enemies with a bunch of shields out, e.g., Rhodoks. This weapon is the biggest reason why Swadian Knights dominate the field.

Then group 4, literally called ""Fodder"" is told to charge the enemy. Pretty much every time they'll kill about half the oncoming infantry before getting murdered by the enemy archers.

Then I just tell the Cavalry to charge, then the infantry. I only ever lose a couple of each, and the rest level up and become monsters pretty quickly, to the point that they're fairly unstoppable now.

I've now put around 12 hours into the game, and so far I'm loving it. However, there are some things I've been wondering about. I've figured out how to become a vassal or mercenary, but every time I do, I end up joining a siege and getting half my soldiers killed because there's only one ladder up to the castle.

Are there any mods that have a better siege experience? I would prefer to be able to use my current save, but I'll create a new one if I have to.

Second, I've heard a lot of good things about the Floris Mod Pack. From what I understand, it adds new sounds, textures, a couple of people to help rule your kingdom, and some interface tweaks. It sounds great, but can I use it with a Native save?

And finally, I've been thinking about the best way to create my army. I want an army that can be offensive and defensive in sieges, which makes me want Swadian Knights for cavalry, Nords for infantry, and Rhodoks for archers. Is this a good plan?

I have been playing them quite a lot and was wondering what everyone else's best tips and tactics were.

I will go first.

* Holding down F1 allows you to position a flag to which your units will move.

* If you have riflemen, keep them a fair distance back, and spread them out as much as possible to lower chances of being hit.

* If you have riflemen, and there are enemy cavalry on the loose, stay near line infantry, or on top of a steep hill for protection.

* If you have line infantry or guards and are fighting riflemen, don't hang back and try and win a sniping battle, get up close where your handicap in accuracy matters less, and your increased reloading speed counts more. Also, don't be afraid to charge them. You will always win in a melee, even with around 2-3 odds on arrival.

* Don't be afraid to retreat back to your allies. Your men are far more useful alive, and will usually get more kills with other people drawing some fire.

* Always be cautious of suprise cavalry attacks. Be ready to group your men close together, when you first see cavalry coming towards you.

* Flanking the enemy can do wonders. If you run your men off to one side of a skirmish between two sides, you can advance your forces along the line, while you have a high number of people shooting at their line, but much of their line does not have a clear shot at your troops. They will often be distracted by the forces on the front, allowing you to get closer before you unleash your first volley.

* If you order your troops to switch to melee mode when you want to advance, and then ranged mode when you are in position, you can prevent people from aiming as they move, and hence dragging behind the rest.

* If you have cavalry, be patient, and wait for opportunities, as well as remaining ready to defend infantry from charges.

* Use terrain to your advantage. Hiding your troops behind a hill can allow you to easily flank the enemy, and catch him by suprise. Infantry charge slowly uphill. Cavalry are reduced to a snail's pace in water, and are often halted by trees in forests. Use the map to your advantage.

1361276799.0,15,self.mountandblade,18tc6t,Integrating multiplayer into the singleplayer campaign like Dark Souls?,MrWendal,18,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/18tc6t/integrating_multiplayer_into_the_singleplayer/,"After playing Dark Souls I’ve been thinking about how to integrate the singleplayer campaign with multiplayer features, and still maintain the whole “pause when not moving / in battle / shopping in towns” mechanic.

PVP

1.**Arenas.** Melee fights and tournaments could feature multiplayer, with other players within your level range. AI combatants would make up any missing numbers. CONS – multiplayer might become more about stats and gear than skill. Separate, balanced multiplayer still needed.

2.**Banditry.** Bandit players could set up “ambushes” on their singleplayer campaign map. When another player comes near the same map point in their singleplayer game, a battle begins. One idea: to prevent ganking, perhaps the ambushing player would need to have a lower level / less troops than the player they are attacking. Up for debate. Also, like in Dark Souls, you can only be ambushed once every 15 minutes or so.

COOP

1.**Enlisting.** You could enlist in your friends army, Freelancer Mod style. Your singleplayer campaign character is imported to their game, joins your friend’s army as a hero, and you control that character when your friend battles. To prevent boredom when your friend is romancing or gear shopping, you could continue to play your own single-player game, and only when your friend enters a battle do you join their game. At the end of the battle you go back to your single player game. If you are already in a battle or otherwise occupied when your friend starts a battle, the AI takes control of your character in your friend’s game.


2.**Mercenary Attachments.** In Prophesy of Pendor, kings can hire mercenary attachments that permanently follow the king for the month. Why not join your friends game with your whole army?  To prevent this being OP, you could make it really expensive, or have a high renown requirement. Like I wrote above with enlisting, to prevent boredom you could continue to play your own single-player game, and only when your friend enters a battle do you join their game. But they can always see your merc unit following them, and if you are otherwise occupied the AI takes control of them in battles.

Of course, any singleplayer / multiplayer integration would need to have an opt-out choice, an “offline” mode, for players who want a pure experience.",,False,self,t5_2qzpd,False,,reddit,True,t3_18tc6t,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/18tc6t/integrating_multiplayer_into_the_singleplayer/,

I then proceeded to conquer all of the Nord faction and most of the Vaegir in the name of my new Kingdom awarding fiefs to my new vassals appropriately. (keeping 2 large cities for myself) When I realized the rest of the world was growing uneasy about my conquest I decided I would pull a craft move to try to increase relations and keep my fiefs. So... I accused all my vassals of treason, claimed all their land and then joined up with the Khan. Everything seemed to work pretty well. I was now an honorable member of the Khan and everyone in the world hated me less and I got to keep 5 Cities and all the many castles and towns that were in between.. Until I learned about something called tax inefficiency...... So as you can imagine I'm fucking drowning in debt trying to defend and pay for all these places. So my question is this. (below)

The Sarras kept letting me back in the castle with no arguments though, and while them letting me in each time was just a lapse in the diplomacy mechanic it **felt** like they were just feeling sorry for me and saying ""All right man, just try and have another go. Maybe this time.""

I recently bought Mount and Blade:Warband during the steam sale, and after playing it for a couple of hours my housemate recommended that I download Floris.
I'm now around 370 days in, have served the Rhodoks faithfully- completely wiping out the Swadians, and going to war pretty hard on the Sarranid Sultunate as well. As the marshall, I conqured Durquba and a couple of castles around there. When one of them was refused to me (I had taken it single handed, with about 60 troops against 150 or so. Felt good) and the option to split and start my own kingdom came up, I thought I was ready and pounced on the opportunity.

I realise now in hindsight that I was not quite ready at all. My right to rule is around 30, and I don't think any of the other kings have accepted me as legitimate. Rhodok went to war with me straight away, and took back Durquba with the whole host of its army... I managed to sign a truce with them after that, so now I am only at war with the sarranid sultante. I have a few questions/pleas for advice.

Is there any way to relinquish my kingdom and resume my position as a vassal of the Rhodok king?

What's the best way for me to make money, as I'm currently in debt (by about 7000 denars).  I now only control 2 castles (and the associated villages).

Have I screwed up massively?

Any general advice?

also- I don't know if it's because I'm in debt, or if it's a bug or just a feature of the game- I'm dominating individual sarranid vassals pretty hard, but I don't get ANY equipment or money at the end of a battle. It makes the 'ka-ching' noise, but no money, and no loot. Any idea what's happening?

Thankyou in advance for helping :-)

This is probably stupid but I have a hard time not doing it. IDK why, it's oddly specific to certain games for me.

So bandit ambushes are pretty much preventing me from really getting far into the game. I was a vassal last time and was doing fairly well and then I get dropped into a marketplace against five maul wielding bandits at close range. My character is pretty solidly built for combat with 4-5 in power strike, ironflesh, shield, power draw. I have fairly solid armor, ~50 head, ~60 chest, ~40 legs or so. Using a balanced bastard sword and war bow. I have fairly good shield too. But I really can't seem to do anything against so many enemies at once, I just get spammed to death and can't get any hits in between blocking. I only killed one of them before going down.

I'm wondering if I'm missing something to the combat, because the game seems fairly reasonably balanced otherwise but the bandit ambushes just seem to put me in increasingly absurd situations - as you get higher level they throw more enemies at you it seems. Should I just never try to go to places at night? Kind of seems stupid that my character would walk around the streets alone when he knows of the danger and he's got so many people who could guard him. :/

I tried loading a save game before I suggested to him to scale the walls, but in every save game load, after I suggest to him that we scale the walls and we go to start the attack, a different lord is already there, leading the assault.

Also, how do I make it so that I lead the attack on the walls, given that I have a very close relationship with the marshal? Basically, I am aiming that the town be given to me by the King, Sanjar Khan, so I want to be the one leading the assault (more likely for the other lords to vote that the town be given to me).

Edit:

By ""leading the attack/assault"", I meant the lord who will be building the ladders (this lord's name appears when you go to the town under siege - you can also verify this by asking to ""speak to the commander"" of the army that is laying siege to a town).

** Edit: ** I'm playing Warband

Of course I have read the others posts with your nice tricks and advices but I want to know how my character can be more famous, and own a village (or something like that) ? 


I want to know everything about my relationship between vassals, king and villages.
*(By the way I don't want to attack vassals, caravans and farmers from my own country)*


So : 

1 - I did some jobs for the guild master ( I failed one ;)  )

2 - I did some jobs for a couple of vassals. 

3 - The king has no job for me. 

4 - I tried to help some villages.



Do I have to go inside the coutry which is in war with my kingdom and do some war/trouble for the king? 

When I will have more fame, does the king or some vassal will have nice offer for me ? 

Thanks for your help . 

** Edit 2 : ** Thanks all for your replies, obviously im trying to do it too fast, I'll do it slower starting by training me and killing some Looters/Forest Theives.

After the white plains of the North were stained red, Ragnar turned his eye south, to the Kingdom of Swadia.Swadian Calvary crashed against the shield walls of the Nord infantry, losing horse and rider alike to throwing axes and sword.  By this time, Aero had risen to the rank of Huskarl, cutting through peasant and Count as wheat falls before the scythe.After countless tournaments and feasts, Aero finds himself in high regard of his King and peers. He retires from the army and raises his own, becoming a nord vassal and being awarded Jelbigi Castle and its fief. So that's been our story so far, I've got about 30 Huskarls and 40 Vaegr archers stationed with some other infantry in the castle, while I have a very carefully maintained 100 Huskarls and 20 sharpshooters in my party.

I post more on the /r/totalwar board but I figured I'd come around here too.

I recently began two new series for Gekokujo and A Clash of Kings. 

Gekokujo: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_4YUWpVmAqn1Vjo-6inVBfsAq3P6RRuc

A Clash of Kings: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_4YUWpVmAqn3aHtiWPpTAatzXz4z-X5i

Here are the following downloads for these mods as well:

A Clash of Kings: http://www.moddb.com/mods/a-clash-of-kings/downloads

For a little bit of a backstory on both mods. Gekokujo is based in the Sengoku Jidai (Warring States) time period of Japan. It's appropriately more history light and very enjoyable overall. 

A Clash of Kings is based on the A Song of Fire and Ice (A Game of Thrones) series. It's primarily focused on the War of Five Kings. It's a pretty hefty undertaking and with other enhancement mods involved has been a pleasure to play.

* After you win the battle, the prisoner taking/hiring screen must appear.

* You will notice a sum of money in the bottom right corner. That is not your player's money but, your companion's money. (The one that you played as during the battle)

* You can spend this money to upgrade your troops only. It cannot be used for anything else.

are you aware that the Silverstag mod for M&amp;B Warband has just had a major release?

I've only been playing M&amp;B since March and I quickly found the mod community thanks to being a long-time member of the Nexus.  I thoroughly enjoyed Brytenwalda (being a Brit, heh) and dabbled a little in Floris.  I then heard about one of the Floris team-members who had moved on to making his own mod, Silverstag.  

I loved it so much I quickly became involved in the feedback and friendly community and was eventually invited to become a beta tester.  This developer and his team are very open about changes, requests, feedback, future goals and any stumbling blocks.  That is a welcome change to some mods I've been involved with.

Check out the changes this fantastic mod brings and then give it a try:

Grab the mod from the Nexus here:

Let me know if this is actually working so it doesn't look like I'm just jumping up and down, begging for attention.

Basically, I've reached a point in the main quest where I can't seem to get any new objectives, and the one I thought I completed is still there, as if I hadn't. I went to Praven to meet Rolf after he helped me, and he told me to ask the tavern keeper about a warrant. I did that, and the tavern keeper gave me the quest to hunt down female bandit gangs. I hunted down all of them, and eventually their leader showed up, and the cutscene played. After that, I went back to Praven, told the tavern keeper, and got my money.

After that, I'm not sure what happened. The ""Hunt down female bandit gangs"" quest said it was completed, but under ""Mainline Quest"" it still says ""Finish the task of destroying forest bandits, given by the tavernkeeper of Praven."" When I talk to Rolf in the tavern, he says the same thing he did before the quest; to go ask the tavern keeper about the warrant. If I ask her, though, she doesn't offer the quest again. I'm guessing this isn't supposed to happen. 

With no way of getting that done, I tried working on my only other ""Mainline Quest"" objective (hopefully sidestepping this problem) which is to continue following the star horn. For that, my clue is ""The holy force is locked somewhere, or it is there to represent the highest glory for the stronger."" I figured this meant winning a tournament, but I've already been through about 12 of those and gotten nothing but money and special rewards. 

Is there anything left I can try? I've started searching for the ""4 clues"" so I have that to keep myself occupied with right now. But is there a save file that I can edit somewhere to advance myself to the next part of the main quest?

To preface this, I've noticed that a lot of people that play this game have also played the Total War series (I actually found out about this game thru a recommendation from /r/totalwar), which really isn't a preface, but more of an interesting personal observation.  Anyways, I think a pre-combat/pre-deployment phase would be useful.  What I mean by that is a map room-esque screen that shows the player an overhead of the battle space and the respective deployment zones.  The clarity and accuracy of this picture would be affected by the commander and his companion's respective scouting skills (the aggregate of their pathfinding and spotting skills). It would also be nice if the player could go ahead and arrange some of his units prior to initiating the fight, and the amount of pre-coordination would be affected by the commander's leadership score (e.g., a 1 in Leadership means the commander could only give one precombat order, etc.).  For instance, if I could go ahead and line out my infantry and archers and notify my cavalry that they will be escorting me.  Of course once the battle begins the player would be able to make on the spot corrections.  

Bonus idea:  Another neat feature, I think, would be if you had ""signal corps"" troops that you gained with ever 5 or so leadership points.  These would be like banner, drum, and/or horn players that would accompany you on the field and relay your commands once given.  I think it would do two things:  1) it would be aesthetically pleasing to have an entourage and add a layer of personal security; 2) it would add a layer of realism as your commands would be delayed, and the delay time would depend on the distance the player is from the unit being ordered, line of sight, and din of current conflicts.

So what's the point of this?  If there are any MODs where some of these features exist, I would love it if someone could point me in that direction.  If there aren't, I would just like to put these ideas out there, and, of course, if you have any cool feature ideas I would enjoy reading them.  Thank you for your time.

Haven't played in a very long time, and decided to try out the Floris Mod everyone is always talking about.  Obviously it's amazing.  However, I'm still fighting one of my old pet peeves:  Levelling companions.  They always seem to get knocked out early and stay fairly low level.  This becomes problematic when my troops start to level and fighting looters isn't cutting it anymore.  I know that buying them better armor can help, and I realize that horses increase survivability, but other than that is there any trick to levelling them?  I'm tired of dragging around injured companions.



Bonus questions:  Is there a preferred place to grind cash/experience in the early/mid game (army size of about 60, almost all tier 2-3, some tier 4 troops).  Bandits aren't cutting it unless it's a big force, but a Lord's army of equivelant size generally stomps me.",,False,self,t5_2qzpd,False,,reddit,True,t3_1h8vjl,http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/1h8vjl/levelling_companions/,

In past warband + diplomacy game I've used the all crossbow/archer army unload and retreat strategy to wear down castle defenses. But I read elsewhere that if you ordered your troops to hold their fire and waited for the enemy to run out of arrows it was a better strategy because your archers would take less losses with their shields up. Well I tried it and it seemed like they never ran out of arrows. There were a few points where it looked like they were about to run out and then a crazy barrage started a happen again.
