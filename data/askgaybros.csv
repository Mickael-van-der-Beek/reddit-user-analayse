I came across Macklemore's Same Love song a few weeks back before my baby girl was born and I fell apart. I cried for hours after watching that 5 minute video on Youtube. I couldn't imagine feeling any different for my child other than the overwhelming love a parent can have. 

I know some of you guys had great homes, others were very trying and unfortunately some of you never had great home lives growing up or even now. I want to tell you all something that I believe needs to be said.

I love you. You are an awesome person, despite your failures, your mistakes and your choices. You're entitled to love and respect as much as anyone else. You deserve to find someone special, someone to build a life with and share all those experiences. You are better than some title or label. You have people, even random people you've never met, that will love you and support you on your journey through life. 

As a new, card carrying member of parenthood, I love you all as any good father should. I can't begin to find words with enough meaning to express the joy, sadness, love and acceptance you all should know and expect from everyone around you.

Oh jeez, I'm getting all verklempt over here. Have a good one fellas and if you're ever in Austin, I'd be happy to chaperone your dates. ;)


Edit: Thank you all for your gratitude. For being a non-participating member, I have witness the wealth of support and guidance you all share with each other. Sometimes I chime in to add my generalized advice, as all things male and relationship in origin are seemingly universal. This post was something different in nature for myself, as over the past few months I've confronted my values and my empathy for others. Not to say I was hateful or anything like that before, but I can suddenly understand the entirety of my parent's struggles, both in their marriage and in parenthood.

From that I was able to regain a sense of humility and a perception shift of the human condition. I suddenly appreciated my significant other more than anyone else I've met. I've accepted another man's ( a term I use very loosely ) children, not just into my life, but into my sense of family. I've witnessed the beauty and wonder of a new life, innocent and unknowing, enter this world that I helped create and will help shape for the rest of my days on this planet. 

My mother and father separated when I was 5-8 years old. During these years, I was also taken advantage of by a female babysitter without anyone else knowing about it. Those two specific events marred my life with problems for the better part of 20 years. My parents did get back together ( 32 years now ) afterwards, but the hatred I had for that man and most women in general haunted me for years afterwards. When I was older and after very difficult, yet productive periods of re-establishing my relationship with my dad, he told me that the thing that brought him back was the song, Cat's in the Cradle.

What's the ""So what?"" of all this babbling? I suddenly have true love in my life. Not hollywood bullshit, no traditional concept, not bound to dating or anything of that nature. Just pure and simple love and desire to share that with anyone willing to receive it.

If you knew me, you'd be amazed at the transformation that has occurred with the arrival of my little girl ( [Here's a picture of me and her 30~ minutes after she was born](http://i.imgur.com/KGR932g.jpg) ).

He even wanted to have a pretend wedding to one of them (which we did).  On Valentine's day he tried to kiss boys.   I'm a single mom, raising him alone, he hasn't seen his father for about 5 years, and saw him only sporadically before that.  He's into dance and singing and loves the spotlight but is not really into sports.  I realize he is definitely in need of male attention. He has not had 1 guy who has been a consistent role model in his life.  I get conflicting advice-many people say he's too young to know what he is, others say to make him feel as comfortable as possible in his sexuality now, and some say he needs to be in more male-dominated activities.

When did you guys know?  Was it consistent from childhood on?  What did your parents do-or what could they have done-to make your feel more comfortable about your sexuality?

**Update**-Thank you so much, guys.  You have no idea how comforting your comments are.  I've been really stressing on this lately.  I just want him to be proud of who he is.

I was at my friends house hanging out playing video games, and after a while we paused the game because he had to go to the bathroom so I was roaming his bedroom and ""accidentally"" touched his computer mouse, his screen turned on and a fullscreen video of a guy giving another guy a blowjob was playing without sound, he must have forgotten to turn it off before I came over. I was a tad shocked not only because this guy has had a girlfriend for three long years, but also because I was actually turned on by the video, I came to my senses and turned the screen off and we continued playing video games. 

Later that night, after not being able to stop thinking about my friend perhaps not being exactly straight and of course the two guys going at it, and to make a long story short I ended up watching gay porn that night, and the next night.

We had decided to get together that weekend to watch Arrested Development from start to finish and I spent Thursday night actually contemplating fooling around with my friend, before this week I had never contemplated gay sex, let alone me having sex with my friend.  

We watched the first two seasons on Friday and at the end of the night I asked him if I could sleep in his bed, which wasn't abnormal at all, we do that a lot but this time I just wore my boxers to bed and I noticed him looking at my body which just made me more excited, but I was way to terrified to do anything. Saturday came and we continued to watch, some guys and his girlfriend came over but left early that day. We spent the evening on his bed watching and laughing until we decided to go to sleep. We were both lying next to each other quoting Tobias and GOB when I looked at him and I don't know why but I went for it and kissed him. He was too shocked to do anything, I removed my face and he said ""what was that"", I said ""I don't know."",  meanwhile panicking on the inside, wanting to run out of the room but thankfully he smiled and we made out. We fooled around a little that night and it was awesome. 

The next morning was very awkward and he told me that we would finish the show later and asked me to leave. He left on a family holiday on Monday and he's coming back on Saturday and I'm freaking out, he doesn't have a phone so I haven't been able to text him or anything. 

..a couple of questions, this can't be normal? Can you become gay? This shift in my sexuality over one week is freaking me out, I look at dudes totally different now and I'm so confused. ...and what should I do about my friend?

Packing things up. While cleaning up my closet, I dug out a valentine's card and teddy bear from my ex.  He broke up with me on April 16th. So it's been awhile.  But reading that brought everything back up.  And then...I found the letter I wrote to myself, basically a diary entry of our first 5 dates. I shouldn't have read it, but I did. And now, well, now I just have to write it all down. Writing heals my wounds, so I'm writing it down.

That letter is just filled with happiness. The most exuberant happiness I've ever experienced. And now I'm leaving this apartment forever. The apartment where my ex and I had our first kiss, our first everything. It all happened here. Where I'm sitting writing this story is where magical things happened. It's also the spot where he broke up with me. Right here. I'm looking forward to my bright future, and happy to be moving out of my past, but, right now, I'm wallowing in nostalgia.

It contains personal information that I'd like to withhold. Also, this is a throwaway. Hence the name!

I feel as if this needs some backstory, if not just a short one. About a week ago I told three of my (what I consider close) friends that I was gay. One was completely accepting, the other one had some questions but shrugged it off and told me we were friends anyway, no matter my orientation. The third one... was not so welcoming. It started with him cancelling all our future plans. Saying that he'd never hang out with a gay guy (which he has been for the past... well, forever) and that I would only try to touch him. He's had a bashful attitude ever since, but I decided not to care. Because I don't.

Trash homosexuality all you want, but it's a part of who I am. That said, it doesn't at all define me. I'm a dude who likes dudes. Still doesn't mean that I'm attracted to every dude I see. And moreso, want to sleep with them. Fuck me, right?

Anyway, back to the story. Fast-forward almost a week til today. This afternoon this guy posts a website to my Facebook wall. It contains information about me, my choice of studies, and my future goals (we've talked a lot about this). What I do for hobbies, etc etc. And the most important and EMPHASIZED (I mean, written all over the page) thing - ""Merits: Gay IN REAL LIFE"" and ""Hobbies: Trains small boys"" (I am a freetime coach).

Okay, so, what the fuck? I usually don't care when people say gay slurs. But holy hell, this actually fucking hurt. It's not that I don't want to be called gay, because gee, I am gay. It's the fact that I am gay... that he seems to think that me being gay is **everything** and **all** I am. Are you following?

Like, I'm gay and nothing else. Just gay. Not even a longtime friend, a guy who's had your back, or just like any other guy on the block. Nope. Just gay. I'm not even going to start on that second remark.

After that, I told him: ""That's it."" and blocked and deleted him from Facebook. A short while after, he sent me a message: ""I didn't know you'd overreact so much. It was a joke. I ask for your forgiveness if I hurt you... I won't stop saying gay because that is just something I say. I don't think you'd react the same way if I didn't know your sexual orientation.

**I'll start off by saying that this title is more rhetorical than anything else.** 

A lesson I'm re-learning consistently is that guys are increasingly afraid of being the one who just says ""no"" when it comes to advances from another person. 

I feel like the default response to an invitation to a night out has become:

1. ""I'm busy"" 

2. ""I'm tired"" 

3. ""Rain Check?"" 

4. Or if I send something by text. The answer can sometimes be ...Nothing at all. 

Don't get me wrong, these can all be valid responses. Shit DOES come up and mess with plans. It's happened to me on numerous occasions. 

The only problem with these answers is that they offer hope. After getting these type of  replies, I usually follow up with:

1. ""How about tomorrow? What works for you?"" 

2. ""We can go later after you rest if you want!""

3. ""Sure! Name the date!"" 

4. ""You there?""

Later, things can become a lot more complicated. I start getting more and more cancellations until responses are pretty much non-existent. 

I understand that anyone with common sense should take the hint and stop trying, but are people really THAT terrified of saying:

""No, I don't want to go on a date with you."" 

""I like you as a friend. I don't like you romantically."" 

""You're nasty, leave me alone."" 

I've always made it a point to be direct with people. 

When I am crushing on someone, I tell them.

When someone I don't like asks me on a date, I say no. 

When that person asks repeatedly, I tell them to fuck off.

The response I typically get from these messages is: ""Asshole""

I'm.so.ok.with.that.

I understand that some people don't have tough skin, but what favors could people think they are doing for people by being indirect with responses to dates or romantic advances? 

I'd much rather people say they aren't interested in me rather than give a huge response describing why ""it's me it's not you"". 

Yes, I will be disappointed. I can get over it. What I can't get a over is an uncertainty. 

I'd love to hear comments or thoughts on this from you all.

My dad reacted even more aggressively, commenting that i should change or get out (which is my intention, but not at the cost of cutting ties with my family). They were also adding how I'm educated but stupid, and homosexuality is a Western influence and a result of me watching so many movies. Like i said, they really have an ancient state of mind and is unbelievably misinformed when it comes to homosexuality. At one point, my mum asked me, aren't you guys worried of AIDS?

Long story short, this happened last weekend and they were supposed to go to Singapore for a weeklong trip. My brother informs me that my mum has been crying non-stop and my dad has not been sleeping. They are also cutting short the trip and will be back tonight to ""talk"" about it, while commenting about how they are very disappointed that their hopes and dreams for their youngest son are now DASHED. I have a strong feeling that they will ask me to ""change"" as they have a deep seated belief that homosexuality is a choice, despite my numerous attempts to convince them otherwise i.e. asked my mum, how would u feel if i asked u to like a girl now? They also believe that having a gay son is a family shame and should be kept from the knowledge of all relatives and friends.

I am conflicted, how do i deal with this? I could easily run away from the prob and move in with my boyfriend, hes willing to take me in, not require any rent, and pay half if we have to buy a car together.
But i will not do that, as they deserve a chance to digest this. But I don't know if i have the patience to deal with all these expected pep talks. What is the time frame i should give them? To be fair, it took me years to accept myself. But I can't afford to give them years to accept me while i stay home and pretend to ""change"".

**TL/DR came out to asian parents, parents react badly and will have a talk with me tonight, whats the best way to deal with this?**

I am conflicted Gaybros, what should i do? ps. forgive the rambling.

**Update: Wow, the time and effort you guys put in your advice is simply amazing. Thank you all!.. I tried to adopt some of the attitudes proposed, being very calm, composed and mentally ready for the verbal insults. 
Anyway this is what happened. I got home to my mum crying in the dark, she looked like she hadn't slept in days. My dad did not speak to me and according to my brother he too apparently had not slept in days.
So i just picked up dinner from the kitchen and put on Community in my bedroom like I always do. After an hour or so, my mum came in for a talk just like I had anticipated. She started off saying something about how she is disappointed and no parents would think of having a gay child, but broke into tears again before finishing.
I sat there, looked into her eyes and said that if any of us had a choice we wouldn't have picked this path.
In between sobs, she said that she feels guilty for ""doing"" this to me and this ""path"" is not an easy one in life. At this point I was surprised, she had gone a total 180 from her beliefs that homosexuality is a lifestyle CHOICE to accepting that it's something i am BORN with. I told her that I hadn't even blamed her for one second in my life, which was true.
Wow, I really have to hand it to my mum, it took me 20 years to fully come to terms with my sexuality, but 50 years of indoctrinated misinformation and she came around in a mere 3 days! (with huge help from my uncle, brothers who did all the heavy lifting for me while they were in Singapore, reaffirming my statements about how it was never a choice, how it is widely accepted in my generation and how they should keep an open mind) 

She asked, what are my plans for the future, am i going to move in with my boyfriend and I lied a little by saying it's not in the cards yet. I didn't want to further stress her fragile state at the time.
But now it was as if all my fears were unfounded, and I feel bad for not giving her credit in the first place (ready to move out and whatnot). She asked for me and my boyfriend to get tested, not to tell any relative and any more friends (she's still ashamed of it) and that it is my life, so if I'm happy then i should do what i want (albeit begrudgingly the way she said it), IT'S MORE THAN I COULD EVER EXPECT from her in such a short period of time.

So thank you Reddit gaybros! I could not have done this if it wasn't from the all round support i received from friends, family and solid advice from you guys. A huge weight has been lifted off my shoulder, except with my dad he didn't speak to me at all, yet. Nonetheless, I am more than grateful that my mum loves me enough to uproot her beliefs and accept me for who i am. She's not fully okay with it, but I love her so much for trying.

I've always had problems with body image. I wasn't very active growing up, and as such, I was pretty heavy. When puberty hit, I dropped a lot of weight, but I still had a little bit of a belly, and I still do. I'm not fat by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm no porn star either. 

I used to be really bad about my body, and it's significantly affected my life.

Coming out was pretty big in helping because it was one less thing to hate myself about. They flare up from time to time, but I'm working to get them under control. I'm trying to cut back on my porn consumption (Does NOT help to have that shoved down your throat on a regular basis), I'm working out more to get my body as best as it can be, and I'm just trying to banish those thoughts from my brain.

What do I do?,hadgaysexwithfriend,48,9,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1gez09/had_gay_sex_with_best_friend_a_few_times_always/,"So I was on exchange in Europe for the past few months in Italy, my best friend was on exchange in France. To give you background, we are both in 3rd year university, met in first year, lived together for the past 2 years in a 5 person student house. We always talk about how hot girls are, and who we've made out with recently. We've watched porn together sometimes, and talked about intimate details of our sex lives with girls to each other. 

Anyway, fast forward to this year, while on exchange I went to visit him one weekend in France, got super drunk together, I was supposed to sleep on his floor but got into his single bed instead and started watching workaholics. I've always been bisexual but deeply closeted about that, used to hit up POF and more recently grindr for a couple hook ups. Had sex with three men over the past 6 years from these sites, and never told anyone about it. 

Anyway, so I obviously had a crush on my best friend who's very good looking, but I never dreamed of even telling him about my gay sex past. Then when we were in his bed watching workaholics, both super drunk after coming back from the club, I started to put my hand on his leg (don't know what I was thinking?) and then up to his dick. Started rubbing his dick from the outside of the pants, he put his computer on the ground, slide up the bed to where I was and I started to take off his clothes and mine. Started to rub our cocks and jack each other off, making out, sucking each other, and eventually I turned him around and shoved my dick in his ass after spitting and fingering him. Then he started riding me and came all over my chest. I was really drunk and had jacked off earlier in the day, and couldn't thrust that well in his tight ass, so I had to jack off and cum on his chest to finish. The next couple weekends we traveled to a few other places around europe together, getting hotel rooms each time, and we had sex another few times, all starting the same way with me grabbing his dick when we were lying in bed together after coming back from the club. I would fuck him, he would fuck me (though his dick was much bigger and really hurt my ass the first time). 

Every single day after we had sex each time we never talked about it. I just moved back from Europe a couple weeks ago, haven't seen him yet even though we live in the same city, and neither of us have acknowledged having sex with each other, or that we could both be gay (or bi or curious). What should I do? Should I talk to him about it? We are moving out of the 5 person house and living together just us two next year, so I don't think we should be having sex anymore, plus he really is my best friend, and I can't imagine losing him just because we had sex a few times. It still makes me super horny and I jack off constantly thinking of us having more sex together, but I really don't think we should. Not sure if he is gay or if I'm gay, we are both 21 and he's only had sex two times with girls, but had sex 4 times with me, so I don't know what to do?

He told me not to get in contact with him again and that he would be going to camp and then to family in the country. He threatened me and said if he found out I had tried to talk to him, he would tell my parents about me.

1369711430.0,36,self.askgaybros,1f6fcs,[UPDATE]:Hi/Thank You all/Coming out,Brochitect,40,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1f6fcs/updatehithank_you_allcoming_out/,"This is a followup to [my post yesterday](http://redd.it/1f2w4y)

It is done/just begun. I came out to my parents today. There were some quiet, subdued tears from my mom, and my dad ended up being predictably emotionless and even clinical (not cynical) in his responses and questions. Overall, I'd say it actually went swimmingly, all things considered.

Before I broke the news, I could have sworn that I was on the verge of a full-out panic attack. My heart was beating pretty quickly, but more than that, it was beating stronger than I've ever felt it in my life. It was really the strangest sensation. Back to the story, I was sure to get all of my stuff packed and set by the door (I was just visiting home for the extended holiday weekend, so it wasn't like my parents were suspicious) just in case I had to make a quick exit. Luckily, I over-prepared.

I filled up my water bottle, trying to look as casual as possible as I get ready to hit the road for the 3-hour drive back home, and sit down at the kitchen table to gather my thoughts for the last time. My mom was sitting right across the table on her iPad, aimlessly browsing and checking email, and off to my right, turned away from me, my dad's sitting in his recliner watching the French Open. I try to look as relaxed as possible, watching tennis over my dad's shoulder as my parents occasionally make small talk about figuring out what to do for dinner tonight. Meanwhile, I'm sitting almost right between them, soaking in the last few minutes of normalcy before I drop the G-bomb, and try to prepare for the impending fallout when I completely annihilate their world.

What sticks out to me as the absolute hardest part of coming out was the seemingly monumental strength it took just to open my mouth and say the first few words. I sat at the table for what ended up being a solid hour, in near complete silence (I'm a very quiet type, so again - nothing suspicious to them) reworking my words in my head, covertly pulling up /r/askgaybros on my phone and rereading the comments of encouragement on my post yesterday, trying to find that strength to start talking. After realizing that an hour has gone by, and realizing that the only words I've been able to string together in my mental script are ""Well, I think I should hit the road, but before I do, there's something I've been wanting to talk with you guys about..."", I force myself to realize that it's now or never, and that I need to just nut the fuck up and get it out. 

So I deliver my opening line that took an hour to craft, and then, surprisingly, find myself able to keep saying exactly the words I needed to say, without stopping, stuttering, or stumbling over myself. Realizing that I don't want to try some perfect story arc that builds up slowly to some dramatic reveal, I was able to pretty quickly and directly say the ""I'm gay"" part before the end of my first breath, and then started explaining more after that.

One of the first points that I took special care to make clear was that my being gay was absolutely nothing to do with them, either anything they've done to promote it, nor anything they could have done to prevent it. My mom is going to have the most trouble with this bit because she does have a bit of a knack for trying to be the self-made martyr, and she even told my right then that she still won't be able to accept my explanation, and can't help but blame herself at least a little bit...somehow. She doesn't know how yet, but she will. And trust me, no matter what I say, she'll take it on herself to try and find a way to make it at least partially her ""mistake"" so that she can have some glimmer of hope of ""fixing"" it. While I don't know if it's exactly the word she was looking for, she did say ""disappointed"" more than once, but always with a bit of hesitation. It was to be expected.

Meanwhile, dad is taking his time to process, and every once in a while asking the very statistic-like questions, like ""how long have you known?"". I found that anything I could answer in some kind of numerical format gave him something to grab onto and start to process and fill in some kind of spreadsheet in his head.

In the end, it came down to what I think is a classic response of: (A)We still love you very much; (B)We need some time to process this and think it over because; (C)we don't understand any of this; (D)but we're glad that you're comfortable in your own skin, if this is what you really want; and (E)see (A) again.

And so, I'd gone into this hoping against hope for the best, still preparing for the worst, trying to account for every possible reaction they might have, and then formulating every possible counter-move I could think of. The whole thing played out like a game of chess in my head, and I think we ended up at a perfectly satisfactory stalemate. I'm really just glad to see that they are going to take some time to think things over, and true to their engineering routes, aren't making any rash decisions before taking any kind of action. With any luck, they'll get used to it after some time, and with more luck and a few years, I'm hoping that they'll even accept it, although I'm not going to hold my breath and wait around for that to happen. I think the worst thing to do would be to try and force them to accept it, as that would surely be met with some push-back.

I closed it all up by saying that while I don't just want to drop this news and run, I do have to get on the road and start driving home, but that I would sit there as long as they had any other immediate questions. I said too that I wish I could have talked about it sooner with them, but then didn't want to have a cloud sitting over the entire weekend, and that his way we were all able to enjoy family time yesterday. We got to the point where all they needed was time, so I got up, grabbed my bag, we all hugged goodbye and I got one last ""we still love you"" for good measure, then walked out and drove off.

The best part to all of it was that for at least the first hour of my drive back home tonight, I was just grinning to myself from ear to ear, and had one of the best, most complete feelings of happiness and accomplishment I've had in a long time.

ADVICE TIME (Sorry, I'm not done yet): To the end of trying to help them, but not push them to understand that I'm gay and that it's not going to change, does anybody have some good recommended reading for parents of freshly out gay children? Specifically, anything maybe geared towards religious (specifically Catholic) parents? I've found my mom to respond pretty well to books and reading, and maybe if I send her something to read at her own leisure, she'll get a lot of her questions answered.

As always, thanks again to each and every one of you, whether you've commented to me directly or not. It's just been a huge, huge comfort and sense of support knowing that as I was coming out to my parents, I had the invisible support of +25,000 Gaybros right behind me.

[EDIT NOTE: Holy shit, after publishing I realize I just wrote a novel. Feel free to go off of the cliff notes below]

**TL;DR** - In previous post, asked for advice about coming out to conservative, catholic, emotionally veiled, engineer parents. In this post, described how I came out today, the overall neutral but slightly positive (as far as I'm concerned) outcome, and how absolutely awesome of a feeling I had right after doing it, despite my mom's subtle tears (not being sadistic). Still, I want to help my parents start down the road of coming to terms with my sexuality, and am asking for suggested readings to give to them.

This is just about how I personally feel, my own views only, and I guess I'm looking for advice from people who have felt the same at some point.

I've been for a while with my bf. He's older than me; he was (and is) my first guy. When we first started dating, I was still coming to terms with being gay and so I tried to act all macho and stuff, even in bed, clinging to this idea in my head that yeah, I might be with another dude but I was still a manly man. I tried to fuck my bf once, as I wouldn't even consider it being the other way around, but it just didn't work; I got soft very quickly and after that first disastrous attempt I never tried topping him again. 

Fast forward a couple years: my bf and I have a good sexual dynamic now, he being the top and I being the bottom. I enjoy bottoming for him, even if it hurts now and again, but I simply can't get rid of the nagging thoughts in the back of my head that make me feel ashamed that I'm the one being fucked. I know I'm just stuck on a stupid, old-fashioned view where gender roles are this overblown thing that defines my sense of self-worth. I know, and my bf has told me countless times, that bottoming doesn't make me less of a man in the same way that being gay doesn't. I am also aware of the fact that bottoming or topping are a dynamic, fluid thing that varies with partners, situations, personal preference and experience or lack thereof. But I still feel bad. I hate it when gay friends make reference to sexual anecdotes because I feel like admitting I'm a bottom will make me... less, in their eyes. I also have these internalized feelings where I think it makes me weak to be the submissive partner in the relationship, to be the one taking it from another man, adopting an (ugh) feminine role. It bothers me. It's irrational and idiotic. And I just can't shake it off.

Have any of you guys ever felt this way? I could really use some advice other than 'go to therapy to address your clearly deep-seated issues with societal restrictions on gender-appropriate expressions of your sexuality.' I can't afford therapy. I guess I'd just like to hear from  somebody who understands.

Thanks.

He seems to be smitten by me as much as I by him and we connect perfectly on a non-sexual level.
When it comes to sex though, he is extremely submissive and wants me to ""use him"" as I please. He loves being choked and handled roughly and, of course, penetrated.
I do want to do that, yet I am more the gentle kind and would have to fight the urge to apologize to him...

Also I'm afraid to top because I can't get over the feeling of hurting other people when I do. I know it's stupid, but while it's somehow arousing to think of it, I rarely ever went through with it in my past relationships, because the thought of inflicting pain on a loved one turns me off.
It doesn't help that I have a rather large organ. And I haven't topped in years and am afraid my inexperience will show.

The last factor is our age difference. I'm 34 and he is 23. We're both perfectly fine with that, but while he is still in a very sexual and experimental phase, I had already settled down in an 8-year-relationship (almost without anal sex, btw) and was only thrown back on the market a year ago...

So far I've tried to be generally dominant (though it somehow feels like a charade) and have postponed anal with the creative excuse of ""not wanting to unwrap all presents at once"", but I can't fend him off much longer...

This guy really is very important to me and I don't want to mess it up because I cannot satisfy him sexually.
Any advice?

Edit: Thanks a lot for all the comments and tips. It helped a lot. While I'm getting better at the dominant stuff (and am enjoying it more and more as well) we even did anal for the first time yesterday.

Wall of text incoming, sorry. Like the title says, I'd like to get some opinions/advice/input on the following.

I've been in a relationship with another guy for nearly six years now. He is the first guy I've ever been with - when we met I actually still had a girlfriend, but broke up with her to be with this guy. I was in my early twenties at the time, now I'm almost 30. It's been a long road for me, coming to terms with the fact I am gay, coming out, etc etc, and my boyfriend has been with me through it all. We love each other very much and I can honestly see myself spending the rest of my life with him.

But. My bf is almost 10 years older than me, so when we met he'd already had a long history of relationships behind him, exes and so on, whereas I've only ever been with him. He is able to tell me that he's been around, seen it all, and that he would always choose me over any of the others, and often tells me how lucky he is to have found me. I feel the same, but in my case I don't have that experience of past relationships like he does. And I get... well, I guess curious, sometimes. I think about how it would be to have sex with a different guy, to try out different roles from what we've established in our relationship, to just cruise in a bar or flirt on an app or have casual sex with a stranger. Maybe it sounds awful, but I can't help but wonder what it would be like. 

I haven't been unfaithful to him or anything, because we're strictly monogamous and he's told me that the one dealbreaker for him would be for me to fool around with some other guy. It's not even up for discussion. And I also know that what we have is special, and hard to find, and maybe I'm just complaining mentally about how I won the lottery on my very first try with him without having to go through the entire dating/searching thing for years and not finding the right man. I've already got the right man... but I can't help thinking that maybe I missed out on something by never being out there, experimenting a bit, and so on.
    Sorry if this is a bit ranty - these thoughts have been chasing themselves in my head for quite a while. I'd just like to get your opinion, or maybe some insight if any of you have been in a similar situation. Thanks!

I've been in a relationship with a really amazing guy for four years now; two years ago he caught meningococcal septicaemia (meningitis), after almost dying and spending a full year in hospital with me spending every possible moment at his bedside he was finally discharged, unfortunately he has been left severely disabled, he'll probably never walk again and he requires carers for everyday living.

*deep breath*

I still very much love him, but I hate what has happened to our relationship as a result of his illness. He is warm, charming and a little bit cheeky, but he has also become self-centered, seemingly unable to comprehend my feelings and emotions and only concerned with his own. 

We've not had any sort of sex since before his illness because its so bloody complicated (I mean literally, hoists, specialist beds, etc), even trying to figure out how it would work and what we could do causes me anxiety - we've never been a very vanilla couple and because of the severity of his disability, we're not able to do any of the sort of fun things we like to do! We've spoken about it a little bit but hit a wall pretty quickly. 

Out of all of it though, the bit I'm having most trouble dealing with is that we can't do anything a normal couple can do, I'm so filled with envy at every couple I see that I can't spend any time around them.

He can leave the house with help but its very challenging, so he almost never wants to, when we do manage I have to become his sole carer for the duration we're out, putting a lot of pressure and stress on me and usually resulting in me not enjoying whatever we're doing. He doesn't have enough strength to self propel more then a couple dozen metres, so I have to push him everywhere. He is understandably scared when we go somewhere so he is never grateful and I feel horrible for even trying.

I'm only describing the tip of the ice berg, it's not all bad, but we've lost everything we had and there is no hope of getting it back. I don't know what I should do, I love and care for him but I'm getting nothing out of our relationship, our situation has been described as ""all of the disadvantages of being in a relationship with all the disadvantages of being single"", I could leave him but we'd both be devastated or I could stay in the hope things will get better.

1363374815.0,33,self.askgaybros,1ad72o,So I was at the gym on campus...?,akarinx,38,5,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1ad72o/so_i_was_at_the_gym_on_campus/,"Actually, I was in the locker-room after working out, changing.  I was dressed and ready to go (home), sweater and jeans and just high tops or whatever. Nothing fancy. This guy, who I see all the time, because he works at the front desk of the gym (checking people in, folding hand towels, whatever) and he works out a lot, too.  We literally see each other 5 days a week at the gym because we're always there at the same time.

Anyway - I think he's really handsome and once upon a time when I had no idea what I was doing I asked if he could check my form on my squats, and he helped me out and was really friendly about it, but I just always assumed he was straight.

So he's in the locker room and as I'm leaving (he was in a different row of lockers near the door) we made eye contact (like most bros, gay or straight, will, to acknowledge someone they see all the time, I guess) and sort of ""hey how're you?"" type talk.  As I was about to exit the locker room he was like ""Hey, I really like that sweater thing you have on.""

So I turn around, and he's shirtless and in boxers (hnnng) and his buddy is next to him changing.  Before I could say anything, he follows it up with ""it's really nice ... is that long sleeve?"" and I sort of half shrugged off my coat to show him and was like ""yeah, it is. I'm trying to remember where I got it at."" 

And of course I couldn't remember, and I just said I thought I got it at Topman (turns out it was express) online.  He then repeated that he really liked it or whatever, and I was like ""yeah, thanks"" (awkward smile from my end at that point).  Then basically we were all ""yeah, have a good one,"" to each other. 

So, normally, I have NO trouble asking a guy on a date.  Like, random stranger in a coffee shop and I have made eye-contact once or twice?  No problem - I'll go up to him and I have a pretty fail-safe script that really minimizes damage if they're straight (they usually are, I've found).  But I'm much more comfortable doing that with strangers, or people I know I'm not really likely to encounter again if it's a no and/or they're straight.

I know there's no way to tell if someone is gay or not without asking, but like, does that seem like typical ""straight bro"" behavior?  Commenting on a sweater and going on and on about how much he likes it?  It seemed like he was just using whatever he could to make conversation.  Do I just leave it, or do I ask him out and just have it be hellishly awkward after if he says no or is straight?

1367397636.0,31,self.askgaybros,1dgzhz,While watching Iron-Man 3... (confession of my first real sexual experience),intellectual_rapist,39,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1dgzhz/while_watching_ironman_3_confession_of_my_first/,"Hello everyone, I just want to take off my chest this confession, sorry for the wall of text, but if someone is interested to hear my story please read further...

Last Sunday I went with several friends to watch Iron-Man 3, and as expected, it was crowded. While searching for available seats we found out that we had to split to smaller groups scattered around the theater. At the end of the ordeal I sat with my best friend (he's straight) to my left and another friend to my right on the farthest row from the screen. Now, approximately halfway through the movie, I felt particularly bold (or stupid) and put my hand on my best friend's leg...

Now, let me give you some background: let's call him Ian. Ian and I have been best friends for many years. He is (supposedly?) straight, in fact he currently has a girlfriend. He thinks I am also straight (in fact I'm not sure of what I am yet, I've never done anything with another guy but I've had... fantasies). So, we have a very close friendship, and physical contact is common between us, we hug a lot and when we get alone we have sometimes kissed on the cheek. He has always told me how we values our friendship and that he loves me a lot. Now you get why I am so confused, right? That's why I have my hopes up with him, although I don't even know what I expect myself...

So back on track, I put my hand on his leg, and this is not the first time I've done this, but as he has never rejected physical contact with me, even at this point, I decided to take a risk and move my hand slowly upper his thigh. I was nervous but he did nothing to stop me, so I reached his groin area. I stopped but left my hand there. I felt like if it got warmer and warmer if that is even possible. I waited to see if he rejected me in any way, but he did nothing. After a while I started fondling that area, I honestly was looking for touching his dick or balls at this point but I felt nothing... That is when Ian turned his face towards me and whispered to my ear: ""Careful, you're gonna get your hand pierced"". I don't know what went through my mind at this point, I just thought ""fuck it"", and reached my hand to his crotch area but I felt nothing... But then I continued further to his left leg and there it was... I felt a bulge there... At first I wasn't sure, but I touched around and I then I was sure, I was touching Ian's dick! And he was hard! Thinking back now I am really surprised on how the fuck did I have the balls to do this, but there I was, fondling his hard dick with my hand over his pants... Minutes passed and I continued doing this, and I was bewildered because he acted normal, as he was watching the movie, he even make remarks about it with me! In my mind I was like ""is this really happening or is it my imagination?"". I was getting horny, and as minutes passed and I kept fondling his dick I moved my had to his zipper but I didn't find it... I built up courage and shyly (I was blushing, lucky it was dark) asked him softly: ""don't your pants have a zipper?"" and he turned to me and said: ""no, they have buttons..."" I did not reply, I was really embarrassed to talk to him at this point, and I felt doubtful because as I said, he was acting as nothing was happening... But after a pause, he said: ""do you want me to unbutton them?"". I just nodded and he started to unbutton his pants... When he finished I just thought: ""am I really gonna do this?"" This would be the first time I was gonna touch another guy's hard dick... But I reached for his pants again... and I grabbed his dick. Wow, he was still hard, it felt so good. I started just fondling it but after a while I got it out of his pants and started jacking him off. After some minutes he said to me: ""what, can't you get the milk out?..."" and after a pause ""I don't feel a thing"" in a somewhat mocking tone. I was confused by this, and was a little disheartened as I felt he wasn't enjoying it as much as I was... More minutes passed... He was still just watching the movie, or at least seemed that way and I honestly was still sad but I kept jacking him off, I just wanted to continue.. But, near the end of the movie, if not the very end (my memories are a little foggy), I felt his dick pulsing and he cummed in my hand. It felt so good and I was happy at the thought that maybe he enjoyed it. I smiled, turned to him and said: ""didn't you say otherwise?"", he just laughed quietly, and I spread his cum all over his dick. And then it hit me: what were we gonna do? The movie was just ending and people would start to move and lights would be on again! Luckily his load has mostly in my hand and he didn't cum a lot, it also strangely dried up very fast. When I finally took my hand off his dick (after what seemed to my a long time) he told me ""why don't you smell it?"" in a jokingly manner, but I did and he just laughed and he made me laugh too. I think he was embarrassed when I looked at him, he smiled at me and said something like: ""you got too far dude"", I just smiled at him back.

Now the sad part of this story... I was very excited to say the least, I didn't know what would happen next between us, what would he say about it... When we were reuniting with the others to head back to the car he was silent... He just talked with others and left me (usually we are always together, as I said we are best friends). When we got in the car with the others we were next to each other but he was silent, I tried to talk to him but he said he was sleepy (it was night). I felt a little down, I somewhat expected some funny remarks about what happened or just *something*, but he didn't say anything. That night I jacked off thinking about the experience that just happened (I needed some release too, lol). On Monday I was thinking about it all day, I wanted so bad to talk to him but I didn't see him that day. At night we chatted on FB a little but just inane things... He said he was busy doing homework and didn't talk much with me... Today (Tuesday) some friends invited me to play soccer and he FB chatted me that he was going too, that I should go, so I went but he showed up very late... He said he went with other people to play at another place... Now, at this point I don't know if I'm being paranoid or what but I feel like he's kinda avoiding me, or at least avoiding the subject.. I tried to talk to him but he just talked about other things. He talked about his girlfriend, how much he likes her, he talked about other girls too (how he gets the attention of other girls and his girlfriend gets jealous) When he was about to leave I said to him: ""hey bro, why are you being like this to me?"" and he said ""I don't know what you mean"". Then I said: ""you really don't know what I'm talking about?"", he just said ""No I don't"" and bid farewell. 

Guys, I don't know if it's my imagination, but I feel he's avoiding the subject. Or maybe it's me that is a little too eager to know that he acknowledges what happened. I admit that I feel disappointed that it was kinda of a big deal for me (I keep thinking about him and what we did all the time) but I feel that it was nothing to him... I mean, just thinking about it gets me horny but I feel like it's not the same for him, I feel like has not even thought about it since then... I was expecting some commentary from him, maybe telling me that he enjoyed it at least... In the best scenario maybe he cannot stop thinking about it just like me... My hope was that I make him horny the same way as he has always made me horny. But I don't know what to think or do anymore...

Do you guys have any advice? I know this went too long and maybe it's not that interesting, but it's kinda a big deal for me what I am going through right now and I just wanted to confess it so I don't feel like it never happened as he is making me feel. Any comments on this boring story are really appreciated.


**tl;dr I jacked off my best friend at the movies, he cummed on my hand. A couple of days have passed and he hasn't acknowledged that it ever happened, I feel sad because it was kinda a big deal for me but for my friend it seems it meant nothing, and I fear maybe he didn't even enjoyed it.**


Edit: Thank you for the responses I've got, I really appreciate your support. I just wanted to make myself clear on what advice I'd like to hear. The questions I am struggling right now are: Should I act like nothing happened and never talk about it with him? Wait for him to see if he mentions it but if not, never speak of it ever? Or should I directly address it with him? In a joking way? (We joke around a lot) In a serious way? I think I'm fucked anyway because even I don't know what should I expect or what I want from him... I just wanted some acknowledgement at least...

Now, I'm no idiot (or so I like to think) and I know that he's straight, so I never tried anything.

He's one of my best friend's many roommates, all straight, and I hang out at their place all the time, drinking beers, playing N64, making music, etc. As the only gay guy of that group of friends, they sometimes would (jokingly) ask me questions like which one of them I would date, which one of them I thought was the most attractive, and other random dude questions along those lines. I'm not insecure about myself, much less around these guys so I always light-heartedly made comments about the one guy, say his name is Nick, and how he was definitely the most attractive one of the dudes. He usually would just laugh and tell me he was flattered, followed by a cheers and more beer-drinking.

After that conversation happened around three times, I stopped trying to sound like a had a really creepy crush on this guy—I didn't want to make him uncomfortable and I was fine that he was straight, I was seeing other people anyway and he was getting a healthy dose of beautiful women.

Fast-forward to around five months later, last week. After a night of moderate drinking, I mention that I didn't want to walk home, to which he promptly invited me to crash in his bed. Not thinking anything of it, I did, and we both passed out. Nothing happened, no big deal.

The next night I found myself in the same drunken situation, and once again he invited me to stay. Except this time we make out. He kisses amazingly and I go for the classic back-of-the-neck grab. After about 15 seconds we stop, and he says ""Okay, goodnight.""

Now It's been a week, we haven't talked about it, I've been over there multiple times since and he hasn't made a move. I have no idea what he wants or why he did that. I'm still convinced he's straight, but I don't even know what to think.

**TL;DR: Straight friend who I've been slightly crushing on for over 8 months invited me to his bed and kisses me completely out of the blue. Now I'm totally infatuated and don't know what to do.**",,False,,t5_2vgfw,False,,,True,t3_1c37y1,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1c37y1/yet_another_straight_bro_problem/,
1376629473.0,29,self.askgaybros,1kgyb1,"I'm a fem guy and I have a question for the gaybros regrading dating exceptions, gender roles, etc. (NSFW)",stylishg33k,34,5,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1kgyb1/im_a_fem_guy_and_i_have_a_question_for_the/,"Hiya peeps! I'm not a gaybro, but I sub /r/gaybros since alot of my interests overlap and I tend to date alot of bros. Love the sub btw ^_^

Apologies in advance for the wall-o-text. I tried to break it up to ease the reading, but I feel like the only way I can properly ask my questions is if I fully explain where I'm coming from.

My gender identity is pretty set. I was born male and I identify as male. I see myself as a male and there's no shaking in that idea. However I do like be a bit of a genderfuck when it comes to how I dress. Sometimes I just like a simple pair of bootcut jeans and a button down with some boots. Other days I'm in some skinny jeans, a cut off tank, and rockin my hello kitty purse. I'll go weeks without shaving and then spend 3 months hairless as a baby's bottom. And I like myself that way. I like being different, and it makes me happy. I'm able to look at myself in the mirror and be pleased with what I see. 

And besides all that, I'm more feminine (**God** I hate having such basic terms like Masculine and Feminine to work with, but that's the English language for ya) in my mannerisms and yes, I do love shopping and Lady Gaga. But I also enjoy guns (there is a .45 Smith &amp; Wesson with a dark cherry wood finish that I am DYING to buy. Will look quite nice in my burgundy Coach purse. Fucker will set me back about $1500 but I'll be *damned* if I get caught not packin heat in a dark alley one day). I'm a die hard Michigan fan (GO BLUE), and if you touch my fucking grill while I'm watching over my ribs, you'll lose a finger.

I say all to say that while I identify as a femme male, I don't identify as a woman. And the problem I'm having is translating that identity to my dating life. While I don't mind having a door held open for me or a guy paying for dinner, it does start to bother me when I'm unable to reciprocate since I shouldn't have to ""worry about those kinds of things."" And while I don't mind being treated like a princess, I also don't want to be coddled. I've dated many guys in the past who feel an urge to ""protect me"". One ex of mine even taught me how to properly fire and use a gun (while that did start my fascination with the subject, my point of him feeling it was important to show me that stands). I am a man and as such it's almost dehumanizing in a way to be expected to act like how ""woman should act"" or that I have to be watched over in a similar sort of way.

Sexually I'm a submissive, so I typically date guys who either are more dominate or are actively involved in the fetish community as a Dom. I don't mind wearing a skirt during sex or ""crossdressing"" if you will, though I tend to only do that if my partner has an affinity for it. Being called a ""bitch"" or ""sissy"" is within the norm for me and I'm pretty much just an open book. But again, I am a guy. And I find I don't really have issues, like the ones I describe above, with this when it comes to guys who are Doms within the fetish community. Only when I'm dating average joes who just like to get freaky in the sheets.

I guess I just want to know what other gaybros' expectations are when it comes to dating fem guys? Is there some unwritten code I'm missing in how it's supposed to work? Or am I right in thinking that I shouldn't be expected to act and be ""the woman in the relationship""? And what can I do to prevent these kinds of mixs up? And lastly, could this be an issue that's tied to how I am in bed? Could my (and my previous partners') sexual preferences have played a factor into how they think I want to be treated?

If there's something I'm doing wrong, I want to change to prevent the problem. Honestly, I just want to know what I may, or they may, be doing that leads to this idea that I want to be treated as a stereotypical female. 

I should be clear, I don't mind the idea of looking and being more ""female"" in my presentation. I don't mind the chivalry. And I don't mind guys wanting to ""protect me"". What bothers me is the *expectation* that I have to be on the receiving end of these kinds of things. And that I shouldn't be able to reciprocate them.

**TL;DR: I'm a fem guy who expresses himself as such and is comfortable with some aspects associated with a more ""feminine"" gender role. However I am a man, not a woman, and find it hard to find men who will treat me as such.**

*Side Note: I don't want anyone to get the idea that I think a woman should be treated in the ways I described above. When I use the term ""expected to act like how a 'woman should act'."", I solely use that term as a way to describe the situation. In no way am I implying that women should have to, or are wrong in, acting or being that way. This applies to all other instances where I use such language.*",,True,,t5_2vgfw,False,,,True,t3_1kgyb1,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1kgyb1/im_a_fem_guy_and_i_have_a_question_for_the/,

So here goes.

I’m a 19 year old guy who doesn’t know who I really am. Everything in my life is pretty great, not gunna lie. Good family, awesome friends, I absolutely love my college, my Fraternity, my major, everything, except for one thing: my sexuality. I’m not straight. I guess I know that for sure. I’m bi, maybe even gay. But I’m so afraid and I feel so alone in this. Nobody would ever know I wasn’t straight, I’m a real outgoing, fun, masculine guy, I’m in a Fraternity, I’ve played ice hockey my whole life, work out a ton, the usual guy stuff. I’d even consider myself a pretty attractive guy, I don’t have a problem hooking up with girls, although I still haven’t even gone all the way, I’m a virgin. I didn’t grow into myself until later in high school, matured real early so I was always much older looking than my peers, so I never really got the chance nor wanted the chance to lose my virginity to a lot of immature girls that I was around. 

But, I like guys too. I watch gay porn, and definitely like it, and I can pick out an attractive guy just as easily as an attractive girl. I want to hook up with a guy so bad, but I’m so afraid to put myself out there. The fear of not being accepted, of being bisexual or gay, of labeling myself incorrectly, of growing up to never have a wife, all of these things have been crippling me in the past year. I’ve gotten really depressed, and I can’t show it because I’m too proud to talk to people about my problems and I can’t tell them about this anyway, so I just fake it and seem like a totally optimistic and happy person. I’ve ALWAYS been the person people come to with their fears and problems, I was voted the “Best Shoulder to Cry On” for our senior superlatives for good reason. These fears have really changed me in the past year. I want to come out so bad, and I feel like that’s the only way I’ll be happy, but I always think “what if I’m not bisexual, I’m gay? Or maybe I just need to go all the way with a girl, then I’ll realize I was straight all along? Will I look like an idiot trying to hide his homosexuality by calling himself bi?”. 

I think it really just comes down to fear. I want to be straight so bad, but I don’t think I am, and I feel like I’m running out of time. I want to live the young and most fun years of my life happy with myself and my sexuality, and I’m afraid I don’t have much time left to come to terms with it. Someone please point me in the right direction, I just don’t know what to even think anymore.

I genuinely feel more comfortable (romantically and sexually) with older guys. Like in their 30s and 40s. A lot of what I read on here and hear from my friends, though, is that this is strange. That romantic relationships just don’t work between guys with that much of an age gap, and there’s the half your age +7 rule, etc. 

I’ve recently met a guy who I like, and I think he likes me, too. He’s 42. I know that I like him with no ulterior motives (e.g., gold-digging, fetishizing older guys) - it is possible for him to also have no ulterior motives, right? (e.g., fetishizing younger guys, some kind of social status symbol) He is sweet, gentle, and devilishly charming.

I get confused sometimes because so many people talk about older guys “preying” on younger ones in these situations. Please halp, o wise gay brothers?

**UPDATE #1**: So curiosity got the better of me and I went and downloaded Scruff. I bought the full version so I could adjust the exact location and time people were on. Here I was chatting to a guy named 'x' who had no location tracker on, no age, but the exact height/weight of my boyfriend who I tracked down to be exactly as to where he is staying. He lives in the exact same suburb of Sydney that my boyfriend does. Works in the city where my boyfriend does and speaks exactly like my boyfriend does. Typo's and all. He goes offline to go to dinner the exact same time my boyfriend does, and I start pushing the conversation too much with 'x' when he stops talking. Suddenly 'westieboy69' (he lives in the west of Sydney) starts chatting to me out of the blue with a profile picture of an obvious model I might add. One I have definitely seen in magazines before. I post up more fake photos, he realises something is up. Within 20 seconds that profile is deleted but located at the exact same location as 'x' I g through Manhunt and search 'westieboy69' and I am greeted with a profile located in the suburb right next to him, with no stats and his profile reading 'hi guys GWM dte and a great soh so just looking for friends' yet it lists in his likes 'Sex in public' which my boyfriend just recently told me he wanted to start having sex out of the bedroom, and we ended up having sex outside.

**This is fucked up.**

**UPDATE #2**: So I continue talking to this 'X' guy, he is a snowboarder (same as my bf). I ask him how old he is, he doesn't answer. By now I am fucking pissed off. My boyfriend sent me a message and I said 'Btw you have every right to be pissed off at me'. He doesn't respond. I send another message, rather ambiguously 'Freaking out a little bit?' obviously me referring to the situation at hand, not him being pissed at me. He replies instantly 'No sorry we just got back from dinner and my phone died. I'm not pissed mr I said this.' I don't reply, an hour later he sends 'Mr?' to which I say 'Yeh I know just feel real bad is all mr x' obviously alluding to the profile. He doesn't reply. Meanwhile I am still speaking to 'X' and I ask if he has any more pics. Instantly my boyfriend logs onto Facebook, after it being 'on mobile' (which it never is) for the past 2-3 hours whilst he is at dinner (what does the on mobile mean btw?) to which I think is to source more pics. By now I am fuming, so I send a message to my bf saying 'Can't wait for those bjays when i get down there!' 'bjays' spelt the exact way he did it. Straight away 'x' goes offline and his profile isn't searchable anymore = deleted or I am blocked. My boyfriend messages back 'Ummmm what? And don't mr guilt doesn't suit you' 'XX'

Now here I am, thinking this is either the biggest chain of fucking coincidences ever, or something fucking so odd is going on here. I call my boyfriend straight away and say 'Ok, you need to be completely honest with me right now, cause nothing adds up here' He flat out denies everything again. He doesn't mention the 'bjay' message at all. He gets angry at defensive. He says that we will talk when he gets back and hangs up. I message him back saying 'You have got to understand from my position, what you did with your phone was suss, what could you possibly have to hide from me, if it isn't this?' No reply. So I send another message 'X is you right?' Now I see he is trying to type a message, deleting it, typing it, deleting it for about 10 minutes. I can't wait any longer so I ring him, he cancels the call. I keep doing it, he stops writing a message. 'Answer the phone' I say. 'I am in the room' he replies. 'Then leave the room?' I say.

I say the same stuff over, this all looks suss please be honest with me right now, I feel I deserve that much. You are 'X' aren't you? there is a pause and then he says 'Who the fuck is X?

I won't bore you with the rest of the conversation, but he still flat out denies everything. Honestly, I am not entirely sure he is cheating. Every time I speak to one of these profiles and say 'Hey man free tonight for some fun?' They instantly log off and are deleted.

I have 3 theories in mind: 
1. He is cheating, and he makes a different profile once he has a hookup to delete any traces. 
2. This is a weird kink, and a way for him to get off and have a wank. 
3. I think he is seriously fucking psychotic and living through other peoples fake personas.

FUCKING HELL, I feel like I am a real life version of Catfish or something.

**UPDATE #3**: This just get more fucked up as time goes on. I just realised I spoke to a guy on Scruff the Tuesday night after I first caught him in the petrol station, who as well had the exact same weight and stuff of my boyfriend. His profile pic was a torso pic, and looks identical to his body, down to the freckles. I was speaking to my boyfriend on Facebook at the time and asked him a question. He took like 5 minutes to reply when every other reply was straight away. In this 5 minute window the guy starts chatting to me. Same typo's and everything as my boyfriend. My boyfriend logs off Facebook to go to bed. Straight after this guy says 'I'm bed' [sic the kinda typo my bf would make] 'Tired' I ask for a face pic, when suddenly all goes quiet, and after 10 minutes he sends me one, one I swear I have seen on Facebook, one of his facebook friends. He sends two more, one obviously a fake pic of someone else, and one of his cock. His dick looks pretty similar, but what caught my attention was the doonah (douvet?) in the corner of the photo. EXACTLY THE SAME AS MY BOYFRIENDS. This is a pretty weird doonah as well, not a common white one or anything. I didn't notice where this guy was location wise, as he didn't have it set to on, and I didn't have people in my favourites with distance trackers to compare. I am really hoping this guy wasn't him cause after I confronted him on the Thursday night for the first time, I left hanging out with his friends because I was so embarassed/pissed of at myself/upset with my self and I made that pretty clear. This dude messages me 'So...into kink?' 3 minutes before my boyfriend messages me 'You alright to find your way home mr?'

Now I talked to this guy again on the Friday night, and funnily enough this guy is now talking to me from 220km away. In Canberra. Where they make their pit stop for food and to piss. This account has now been deleted/signed out of as well.

Sorry for typing so much, but I seriously need a place to vent this. I feel like I am going fucking mental here.

**TL:DR - Either this is the biggest chain of fucking coincidences in the history of mankind and I am going to look like a fucking psycho, or my boyfriend is cheating/mental.**

**ORIGINAL POST**: I'm actually 99% sure I caught my boyfriend looking at Scruff the other day. I was filling my car up at the service station, finished up and opened up the door to ask if he wanted anything from the store. I looked over and he was on his phone, with an app open at a chat screen. He quickly moved and tilted his phone to the left and pressed the home button on his iPhone. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but I noted that I had definitely seen that app before, I just didn't quite know what it was. We had dinner and said he can crash at mine tonight (I live like 5 minutes away from his work, whereas he is like 40 minutes), and he said he had to drop his snowboard and stuff over to a mates place, kinda far away. I spoke to him after and he said ""Ah nah, just dropped it off to [another of his mates]"" which is like a 5 minute drive away from him, and I have noticed he does say these things a lot.

I was browsing through apps last night, and that scenario came to mind and I remembered using Scruff back before we met, and how it looked pretty much identical to what was on his phone.

I confronted him the other night and asked him if he was using what I think he was using on his phone. As soon as I started speaking and saying ""So you know how we went out to dinner the other night, and we stopped off at the petrol station?"" I noticed his eyes were starting to kind of well up. I asked him everything and he gave me a flat out No. He gave me his phone and said look through anything, I promise you I wasn't on it. However I noticed his hands were shaking when he unlocked his phone, and he put in his passcode wrong about 3 times, which is really not like him. I believed him there and then and apologised and felt like an absolute dickhead. He said he was a little pissed off, but he would rather that I ask him, and that I should be able to talk to him about anything.

We went to grab some dinner and I noticed he was acting a little odd, could tell there was something on his mind and at some points it was like there were tears welling up in his eyes. I never mentioned that he was on Scruff, but that I had forgotten the name and just knew it started with 'S'. Now I think I could be reading into things a little too much here, but in my opinion things like this don't happen unless there is a reason. We were walking past a hairdresser and he started talking about how this poster of a girl was really poorly done (he is a graphic designer). He started saying how it was all out of alignment and stuff and then he said ""And her hair doesn't match how clean cut the rest of the image is, her hair is all scruff......y"" and as soon as he mentioned the word scruff his voice dropped in volume, said it really hesitantly, and just completely trailed off. Writing this now makes me feel like a complete idiot, but I think I am fairly good at reading people, and this just really caught my attention. 

If he was using the app just looking for friends, I would have absolutely 0 problem with this as long as he told me. But I don't think this was the case, as he acted so shady when I opened the door at the petrol station.

Another thing, if he has a problem to do with our relationship, he won't talk about it. He will stew over it until I notice he is being distant, weird and emotionally unavailable, and I will mention it and he will breakdown and say what is up, usually only when he is drunk. He has done this a couple of times in our relationship (we have been together nearly 10 months now). I like to think he wasn't using this app hooking with other dudes because he is fairly insecure and things have come up in how he is really afraid of losing me, thinks that eventually everybody leaves him. He did mention once however, that with a past boyfriend, he was on Grindr before they broke up with a fake profile. 

The fact that he acted all surprised, awkward and hastily pointed the phone away from me whilst pressing the home button combined with the fact that he doesn't seem all that keen to have sex these days, and when we do, it is pretty uninspired (I have also noticed recently he has a little trouble cumming, as in I can't remember the last time he has) has got me a little worried. Part of me feels like an absolute douchebag for asking him, and believing this, but some things just really don't add up for me. I have probably been over thinking it a lot, so I don't know what to think. Could I get an unbiased, second opinion here bros?

I really want to talk about it with him again as it is still on my mind, but I'm worried if I do this, it could potentially lead to us breaking up if I am wrong. I love him and I don't think I could forgive myself if that happened.

And then during, it was the most uncomfortable feeling ever. And even when it was over, it didn't really feel like it. So I guess I have 4 main questions:

1.) Is it normal to feel like you're going to take a massive dump the first couple of times? (I actually farted a couple times while he was thrusting which only served to reinforce this fear, FML)

2.) After he pulled out and finished on my chest. He tried helping me finish, but I was just not getting there no way no how. Has this ever happened to anyone else? Tips?

3.) After we showered and laid next to each other for a bit, it still felt like he was inside of me. It was a very strange feeling. Is it just because I'm not accustomed to it, or is this to be expected every time?

*Final: Ok I hope you guys didn't lose faith in me...I'm not the ""safe guy"" I swear. Took a while to actually get everyone together, but once that happened I just went for it. I went to my mom, told her ""If you got a second there's something I like to talk to you and dad about"". After I said that I was literally on autopilot. Luckily I could still physically walk out to the living room where my dad was already at. I sat down pretty much facing both of them and this is the point where I decided that just saying I'm gay is not good enough, I needed to throw in some humor for good measure. I proceeded to say ""everyone who is gay raise their hand"" (not even joking, I said that) and I immediately realized how stupid that felt and then just said, ""I'm gay, that's what I wanted to tell you.""

I had gone over just about every reaction I thought I might face and reality was probably the one I had given the least amount of thought over. The ""non-event"", which makes perfect sense for my family. Everyone act like nothing is happening. My mom just said she was really surprised and that it didn't change anything, and my dad made a poor attempt at a joke, or at least that's what I think it was. 

The workout I got afterwards was probably the easiest and best workout I've had in 10 years. 10 years of shitty facade knocked out of my head, 10 years of feeling fake to a moment of feeling alive. Everyone can act like nothing has changed or nothing happened but for me a lot of shit changed. For the first time in recent memory I don't feel fake, I don't feel like I'm hiding the most horrible secret in the world, I just feel like me. 

I hope all of you see this edit and realize how much I appreciate your spur of the moment advice, It might not mean much to you to write what you did but it helped me tremendously. It gave me enough of a push to deal with this and start to live my life. Thank you all. I'm Gay, I'm not proud of being gay, being gay is just part of who I am and I am, for the first time in a long time, proud of who I am.

1367698502.0,27,self.askgaybros,1dp0ye,"Younger guy keeps wanting to meet for coffee. He's 20, I'm 30. I thought I was being a big bro figure...",brouhway,30,3,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1dp0ye/younger_guy_keeps_wanting_to_meet_for_coffee_hes/,"So, here are the facts:

* Met this guy on Grindr almost two years ago, when he was 18 and I was 28.
* We had coffee a few times initially, then went almost a year without meeting up, then have been meeting for coffee every few months since.
* I have not instigated a coffee-meeting after our first one.
* Dude has always been kind of shy and quiet in person to some degree, even though we've known each other for quite a while now.
* From the beginning, I was up front about the age difference being large enough that I just wanted to be friends, and that I wished I'd had a big gay bro figure when I was his age, etc.  
* He has taken most of my advice, limited in scope as it may be, and has changed from a painfully skinny 18 year old into a well built 20 year old, moved out of his parents house, and generally seems waaay more independent now than before.  Obviously I take only a teeny-tiny bit of credit for this... he was at the age where all these things were ripe to happen anyway.

Now, all this is great, you might say.  What's the problem/issue/question?

We haven't talked in about a month (which is fairly normal), and he texts me asking to have coffee next week.  I happen to be house-sitting about an hour away all week, so I suggested later in the month.  He responds saying he has several days off next week and he can drive out to meet me where I'm staying.  I sort of laughed it off and suggested I had to come back for work-related things a couple times next week and that would probably be easier.  He says that no, he wants to come out and see me where I'm house-sitting.

So I agreed, suggested we could meet at such and such coffee shop, and if he was going to drive all the way out here maybe do a short hike or something.  He seems excited and says he'll come up mid-afternoon, which is a little late for coffee and/or hiking.  

He's also occasionally dropped various subtle and not so subtle hints that he is interested in more than coffee and conversation.  I've always laughed them off, pretended not so get the secondary meaning, etc.

I guess my questions are: 

* Am I encouraging something here that I shouldn't be?  
* If you were (or are) an early 20's bro on the other side of this situation, would you feel totally let down if your big bro brushed off your advances, or glad that you have someone you can talk to who is not going to come on to you?

I'm not interested in this guy romantically.  I'm sure being FWB would be hot and all, but I am NOT going to initiate anything, period, as I feel that would be crossing a line I set up from the first time we met.  That said, if he wants to use me for practice, I wouldn't necessarily say no....  but that's where my questions come in.

Also of note: I'm a decent looking cub-type guy, but not exceptional by any means.  Given his transformation from skinny twink to athletic hunk, I feel like he'd be out of my league regardless of his age or the situation.

TL,DR: Been having coffee every few months for a while with a now 20 y/o gaybro, serving as a big bro figure for the most part (I'm 30).  He seems interested in a bit more than that, I'm conflicted about letting anything happen at all.

EDIT: Perhaps another, better question: how to make it more clear that I'm not interested in sexytimes, but that this lack of interest does not reflect on him personally, while ideally boosting his self confidence at the same time?  I realize that simply saying that and being complimentary is the simple solution, but I know that at that age I was a lot more sensitive than I am now, and I don't want to screw it up.

Most partners feel the need to divide themselves to a top and bottom role. And I am not necessarilly talking about sex. I have been doing a lot of thinking and have come to the conclusion, that (considering my personality and physique) would probably end up in a bottom role. This thought horrifies me. I do not want to be pushed around just saying ""whatever you say dear"" for the rest of my life. I do not wanna be a top either. I dont feel the urge to classify myself as some role in a relationship but it seems like everyone else does and I judt have to accept it if I ever want to be in a relationship sure you can say ""then just find someone who wants the same"".

I've barely topped before. I kind of shoved it in my first boyfriend's ass four/five years ago but it didn't go in all the way. I am *dying* to try it but after so many failed experiences, I've learned my lesson the hard way (no pun intended): the more I try, the more bad experiences I'll have, and the anxiety will keep building up. I've trained myself to resist really casual sex.

I'm healthy and exercise regularly/eat well, and I'm attractive. It's not a physical cause, that's for sure. But my ED is at constant conflict with my high sex drive and how readily available sex is in my city. It's also interfering with my relationships. **I don't go on dates with guys anymore because I can't stop thinking of my imminent failure in the bedroom**. 

I went to two different doctors (I'm in the UK) over the past five years and they both said to just relax. They barely offered anything else to me, no information on where I can more help, NOTHING- I'm pretty sure they didn't take it seriously. But I can't afford sex therapy, it's ridiculously high prices. I don't know what to do, guys. I'm sick of missing out.

This guy, let’s call him Nick, was the first person (along with another friend of mine) that I came out to about a year ago. He has been very supportive and our friendship couldn't be better.

We go to different universities so I don’t see him that often, but just this past weekend my other friend (who I mentioned above) and I, went to visit him. We were just having a chill night drinking, when my other friend decided she wanted to go to bed, but Nick and I wanted to stay up so he suggested going for a walk. On this walk we were basically just catching each other up on recent events in our lives, when he out of nowhere asked me if I wanted to go back to his house and hook-up. This had literally left me in shock because A) he has always identified as straight B) he is one of my really good friends, and C) I have always found him to be attractive.

I was really conflicted with what to do because here is this really attractive guy that wants to hook up with me, but he is also one of my best friends and I really don’t want for this to change that. We walk back to his house to talk about it some more (and have a few more drinks), and he tells me that he is really curious (might have even mentioned being bisexual? I was pretty drunk at this point), trusts me completely, and that he really wants to do this. So I nervously agree, and we hook up. 

It was great. I was really afraid it was going to be awkward the next morning, but it surprisingly wasn't. On the drive home, I texted him explaining why I was so nervous for this to happen and apologized for any weirdness, he responded with “Don’t be sorry, it was a nice treat after a hard week, thanks :)”. 

I am super curious as to what this experience meant to him. Was it just a onetime thing (with me, or guys in general)? I want to talk to him about it, but I’m afraid of prying too much into his life and I don’t want to say something that might make things weird, or offend him. I also want to let him know that I am here for him, if he wants to talk about possibly being bisexual or gay (if that’s the case).

**So here’s my question:** Should I talk to him about this? If so how should I go about doing it? Or should I let him come to me on his own terms? Am I over thinking things?

Sorry for the novel and if this type of question has been answered before. Thanks a lot in advance!

**TL;DR: went to visit “straight” friend, got drunk, out of nowhere he asks if I want to hook up, and I nervously agree. Now I’m extremely curious as to if he’s actually straight. I want to talk to him about it, but don’t want to ruin our friendship by prying into his life or saying something weird.**

I realize people ask this stuff all the time and I have perused some of the material on this page, and on others.  I feel taking a little action in writing would be good for me.  I'll start with a little background.

I am a 30 year old virgin.  Not gay virgin, virgin virgin.  I have never really dated anybody.  Outside a few circle jerks in boyscouts I have 0 sexual experience.  I have a good job, decent looks (pretty subjective I know), and would like to think I am pretty smart.  I graduated college from a decent school, earn enough that I plan to buy a home (without a mortgage) in about a year, and am just starting to see the results from working out I've long wanted by never previously achieved.  However deep down, I feel a great need is not be satiated. 

I read all these posts about other peoples experiences and wonder how this has been passing me by.  I'm not so naïve (well perhaps I am) to be holding out for the perfect guy.  That would almost certainly result in never meeting anybody.  I have friends, sure, but I want a gay friend.  Not necessarily a perfect sole mate (though that would be nice).  

Here are a couple issues I see.  One is my job.  I've been promoted to the top of my company.  I have a lot of autonomy and freedom at work (posting here is but a tiny slice of my liberty) and the pay is good.  However the hours are long (12 a day plus 2 hours of commute everyday) sometimes for weeks at a time.  Beyond that I move around the country a lot (I worked in 4 states in just 2 weeks this spring, though that amount of movement was highly irregular). I live in a constant place (a different state that where I work) but I am almost never there.    

14 hours a day may seem like a lot, but I have always been a busybody in that regard.  Somehow I managed all those years at college never meeting or interacting with any gay guys.  Some people spent their weekends parting, I spent mine working (or sleeping after work).  

Another problem is I am what I believe is called a ""straight acting gay guy"".  My outward demeanor is so straight that even when I tell people that I am guy, they often do not believe me.  

I have met guys on line who I became friendly with, even wanted a relationship, but the distance has always been a issued (I don't think its ever been less than 1200 miles).  I make youtube videos, mostly about politics, economics and history and have about a 1000 subs.  About a year ago I hit of on the genius idea to use it to meet guys and started making videos about being gay, very much to the surprise of my audience.  I have since been contacted by several guys, though not near so many as I had hoped.  Some of this attention has been very flattering.  How many of you can say they were the essence of life's fulfillment to a Married Gay Mormon in Croatia? (Yeah I've gotten that PM).  There have been others from Australia, the UK, France, Utah (somehow I appeal to Mormons I guess), and other places far afield.  While its nice to meet such people, ultimately I want more from a relationship than a Skype chat window.  

I realize this is a lot of venting and condensed autobiography, but I feel this is an issued I really need to start addressing and I though posting here would be a potentially useful step in that direction. I would welcome any comments, suggestions, or thoughts you guys might have to offer!

He refers to my husband and myself as his ""uncles"" and we've known him since he was a little kid though we've always lived in different states.  

He's very out with family, and in college. He's very much like the rest of his family - extroverted and impulsive and not too concerned with convention.

**So browsing porn online today I found his world premier porn video.**

He's been doing gogo dancing at a gay bar for a while now, and it seemed like he might end up in porn.  This is produced by some small company I've never even heard of, which is too bad - if it had to happen, I wish it would be with a more reputable company, as these things go.

I looked just long enough to see that it was him, and it is.

I'm not opposed to porn (obviously), and I don't disrespect people doing it. It is high risk work, but some people - like Colby Keller - seem to navigate it really well.  

I guess my problem is that nephew in question doesn't strike me as having Colby Keller level maturity, and he looks like he's with a pretty sketch company.

In the end, he's an adult and I don't believe I could influence him even  if I tried to.  He's likely consider any input from me as unwelcome. 

So I'm not sure what I'm *asking*, but where else could I talk about this?

Any thoughts from anyone?

Hi, I'm a straight man who has for some odd reason fallen in love with another straight man. We've been dating a long time, and have been friends even longer. I couldn't ask for a better partner :)


We have a problem though- neither of us really knows how to treat the other like a man, for lack of better terminology. During most sexy times, one of us ends up being ""the girl"", because we've both only been with girls. Not that we mind or that there's anything wrong with it, but it would be nice to be able to make us both feel masculine in the sack.

I learn best by hearing personal accounts, so if any of you are comfortable, I would appreciate it if you could tell me about a time your partner made you feel really manly, or just the little things they do (in bed or otherwise)!

Two days ago I went to my doctor for a quick checkup and STD test (two birds with one stone sort of thing). It had been a few months since my last exam, and I figured I should just get checked out. I was not displaying any symptoms of anything other than my allergies, so it was to my horror that I found out I actually had chlamydia. Now, I know that (thankfully) this is not a dire disease, but I am going in tomorrow to talk to a doctor about treatment.

I did, however, notify all of my partners within the last time I was tested (6 in total), and sent them this message:

&gt; Hey. I just found out i have chlamydia. You should get tested to be sure you dont have it. Im going to pick up a prescription tomorrow for antibiotics. Thankfully its not an extremely serious disease and easy to cure, but i was unfortunately asymptomatic. I deeply apologize for this and hope you guys are able to get tested and maybe get help if needed. Please also let any other partners know about this so they may get tested as well. I have informed all of my partners since i was last tested in March about this as well. Good luck to you.

So, I guess I just want to ask, how well did I write out this message? Do you think that it was handled well, and if not, what would you have done? Also, what would your reaction be if you were in my (or my partners') place?

**Update**

I chatted with one of my partners, and I explained that he should be tested, and that with how we *ahem* had sex that he might be at low risk (He didn't suck me and we used a condom while I topped him, duh), but that he absolutely needed to get tested. He appreciated my honesty, and stated that I made him stop freaking out by talking to him about it.

I also made a doctor's appointment to get antibiotics, but the doctor who ordered the test called me right before I left and just gave me a prescription over the phone instead, so I picked it up, and took the four Azithromycin pills just a few minutes ago. I am not to have sex for a week, and *might* be getting a call from the County CDC, but chlamydia is low on their priority list. I apparently do not need a follow up at the treatment has never *not* been effective.

About 4.5 years ago, I lost my virginity by sexual assault.  I was at an LGBT Leadership conference and staying with classmates at a hotel.

Long story short, my roommate got drunk and lost his key.  Someone stole it, broke into my room while I was sleeping, woke me up by pinning me and tying me down and then raping me and taking my virginity.  It's been a traumatizing few years but I've become a more confident person since.  I feel like I can now protect myself if I get into a situation that I need to, but that I am not as closed-off and can be open emotionally to others.

Which brings me to the main question.  I'm thinking about bottoming for the first time now since my rape.  Every hookup, relationship or whatever-in-between I have had, I have always said I was a strict top.  Some guys are okay with that and some tried to push me to bottom.  Nonetheless, I always have topped.  But I know that I would enjoy bottoming physically.  I like fingering and have even tried a dildo a few times.

But I am hesitant about the emotional aspect.  I don't like the idea of someone pinning me or dominating me (obviously).  So, since Gaybros has been such an incredible community to me, I wanted to ask for any and all advice you all can give.  Whether its about how to bottom, fellow survivors of sexual assault, or people helping me figure out a way to talk about it with my partner. 

Just some info - I'm in my mid-twenties, single, and do date as well as have hook-ups.  

EDIT - Thanks for the advice.  I appreciate it.  

I should have been more clear.  I am not considering bottoming in a hookup.  I'm a little too scared with a stranger obviously.  But in my next relationship (which may be very soon with a guy I am seeing), I am hoping to try bottoming.  My last relationship was a mess sexually (partially because of the big secret I kept from him) and I don't want to start this one off saying I am a complete top, no exceptions.  I want to be more open.

I have sought out a lot of counseling and I am also a rape crisis counselor for the Sexual Assault center in my area so I am pretty educated on my recovery process.  I have been doing well for a while now and more empowered.

While the idea of random hookups is somewhat appealing to me in theory, I've usually been a bit too afraid to try it, given my near complete inexperience (tried online dating, community groups, and the local gay bar, but men are just not interested), and my track record of not being able to tell the difference between people that care about me and people that don't. I've also been reluctant because what I really want is not just physical intimacy but emotional intimacy too. However, after a dozen years of extreme loneliness (due to anxiety, the emotional abuse in childhood behind it, and being a military brat, it's been very difficult for me to form and maintain meaningful, long-term friendships, too) and sexual frustration, I'm starting to wonder if I would be happier if I gave up on emotional intimacy and settled for sexual satisfaction. Honestly, I've come to feel that because of the aforementioned emotional abuse, I'm fairly unlikely to be able to form or maintain a healthy romantic relationship anyway. (Before you ask, yes, I tried therapy and medication, and no, they did not help.)

I'm generally concerned that - between usually wanting more than just the physical and being at the point where masturbation doesn't really make me feel ""good"" (read relaxed, less sexually frustrated, or whatever it is supposed to make me feel besides ""no longer have a raging boner; can think about things other than men again"") - having sex would either just not be that enjoyable in the first place or would exacerbate my loneliness and emotional turmoil. On the other hand, maybe it would raise my self-esteem and provide some much-needed fulfillment. If it's relevant, a freshman hall mate once asked me to go down on him, I said no, and I've often regretted it since, so obviously, some part of me wants it.

Basically, I'm confused and frustrated, ready to scream or cry, and don't have anybody I can talk to about it or any idea what to do.

Now I'm wondering about taxes. I work at a large institution (which is very gay friendly, BTW), and I asked the tax guy in HR. My understanding is that I CAN claim my husband as a dependent (I pay the majority of our living expenses, I have two jobs totalling about $56k/yr in income, hubs is currently is unemployed). But, my further understanding is that I CANNOT check ""Married"" on my W-4, because DOMA means that my marriage is legally recognized by my state government but not my federal government. 

FWIW, our state, WA, does NOT have state income tax. 


The tax guy in our HR dept was nice, but he hadn't dealt with this before. Any accounting bros out there who can give me a little advice? Goal is to have Uncle Sam take a little less out of my paycheck because I have a dependent, but not sure how to navigate this with DOMA. 

I checked ""Single"" and claimed 1 dependent. Is there anything more I should know/do? I'd be much obliged for any and all good advice from bros who know taxes &amp; accounting.

1) I was pretty drunk when this happened, so I don't remember the little details
2) It's late, so I'm going to rush this story a bit so I can get to bed. 

Ok, so last night I went out and got pretty drunk. Typical Saturday night stuff.  I left the party I was at and went to the fraternity I live in. One of my brothers got back from a party at a neighboring fraternity at the same time I did. He was stumbling around, so I helped him to his room. We got to his bedroom and I sat him down, got him some water and started talking to him so I could make sure he was ok. We were on a pretty small couch, so we were sitting pretty close together. He starts getting really close to my face and, because alcohol is so great at throwing inhibitions out the window, we start making out. I don't remember which one of us instigated it, but we were both enjoying it quite a bit. Eventually pants come down, dicks go in mouths and a good time is had by all. He passes out afterward and eventually starts peeing himself and gets sick enough that a couple other brothers and I debate whether or not we need to call an ambulance for him. A brother who happens to be an EMT checks up on him and decides that he will be ok, so we decide to lay him down in the bathroom and go to bed. 

I checked up on him this morning and he told me that he doesn't even remember going to the party he was at before he got home and that the last thing he remembers is leaving the first party he was at last night. He didn't act different or awkward around me, so I believed him when he said that he was blacked out for our little escapade. Like I said earlier, I don't remember who kissed who first, but now I can't help but think that I took advantage of him and I feel really guilty about it. I was pretty drunk as well, but I was apparently way more coherent that he was. I don't know if I should tell him or let him be blissfully ignorant of the whole situation. If this were just a random hookup I wouldn't have a problem forgetting about it, but because it's one of my brothers I feel like I should be honest with him.

Also I’m posting this under a throwaway because it’s kind of awkward but I could really use some advice. I’m not sure if it’s appropriate to post here but I feel like my Gaybros usually give really level headed feedback. 
So a little background, I just got out of a six month relationship. I got dumped pretty hard. So Friday night I was bored and frankly feeling kind of sorry for myself so I got on Grindr and pretty quickly got hit up by this guy. He’s in his mid-thirties probably and he’s allegedly really closeted but he likes to suck dick. The hook-up thing normally creeps me out and honestly, I usually bail but he seemed like a nice guy and he insisted that he just wanted to blow me, nothing else. I was in a weird place so I agreed to meet up with him and we…did that. When it was over I was getting ready to go the dude goes for his wallet and tries to hand me a stack of bills.  I’ll be honest, I had a lot of reactions to this were as follows.

1.	I am offended, I’m not a fucking rent boy.
2.	This is like $500 and that would be nice to have
3.	I am a little bit flattered that he thinks I was worth paying for, but still mostly offended.

So I turned down the cash but he was really insistent that he do something “to thank me.” Take me to 
dinner (awkward) or shopping (uhhm?) I felt like any of those options would have been pretty awkward. I told him that I wasn’t that hard up. I’m 25 and I have a legitimate professional job, albeit not in the industry I’d prefer to be working in and not paying what I really feel I deserve.  However, I wear a tie, have have a desk, I’m not the kind of person who would normally be accepting cash for 20 minutes use of his dick. Anyway, when I’m feeling awkward I overshare so I kind of rambled a bit about my mediocre professional life. One thing leads to another and he tells me that he’s an executive for [Insert major media company that I’d love to work for here] and that he’d be happy to hook me up with a job. At first I figured it was bullshit and I was happy to just accept the guy’s business card and get out of there without feeling like a hooker. 
However I did a little bit of googling and it looks like he’s actually legit. Like there are pictures of him at corporate events on the website etc. So that’s my question. Do I call him? I’m 25, I have a degree and I’ve been working in an unrelated industry for a few years. I’ve been looking for an opportunity and this is pretty much ideal except for the obvious problem.  Thoughts?

Turns out, he's not gay; that's cool, you like spending time around him in any capacity.

You say, ""No, and I know right? You should go for it."" Because you're drunk, or you're a nice guy and want everyone to get laid, or you're a masochistic crazy person.

I recently (yesterday) drove someone I cared about away, because I dislike myself so much. I started dating someone 2 months ago.  It was great, we were having way more fun than I've had with anyone in a long time. I genuinely liked him, and for the first time in a while felt confident that he liked me. For the first time ever, I could tell someone was focusing all their attention on me. But I couldn't comprehend why he felt that way. 

He was so much more attractive than me, so much more outgoing and interesting. Why did he like me? Surely there was someone else better than me. I felt so bad about my own body when we were sexual that I couldn't perform-  I was having trouble keeping it up- all because I felt so shitty about myself. Even though I was so attracted to him, even though I really like him I had trouble having sex. 

One night I addressed it. I told him it wasn't his fault. I told him it was me, and that I will get over it, and that I was sorry. This led into a deeper conversation. The message was clear: he truly cared about me, and wanted to know what the problem was. He wanted to be there for me to help me through it. So I explained my self-loathing to him. He understood- he wanted to help me. We had a deep, long conversation. We talked about past relationships, our lives, our fears and dreams. Then, he confessed, in a way that melted my heart, that he had been referring to me as ""his boyfriend"" at work. We decided it was time to take the relationship a step further.

Then, things got strange. Communication slowed, we didn't usually see each other on weekdays, but we went to see a play both Monday and Tuesday, and after each we just parted instead of spending more time together. Yesterday he came over and expressed anxiety about our relationship. He truly cared about me, but didn't know if he could help me. He didn't think I loved myself enough, and that his being with me was hurting me more than it was good for me. He thought now was a bad time and to call this off for now. I told him, in one of the most logical and calm moments I've ever had, that I understood. I told him I was of course, upset and hurt, but that he was right to do what he thought was best for himself. He said he wanted to stay friends or in contact, I told him I needed some time before that could happen. He understood and we parted.

At first I felt a little panicked. My first instinct was to throw my sneakers on and go for a run. I did. I never run. I ran for 15 minutes. That's a lot for me. I stopped at CVS, bought a bottle of water, and a pack of cigarettes and started walking back home and smoking. That's when it hit me. I hate myself so much that I drove him away. 

That is fucking awful. I have to change.

Why couldn't I just see this for what it was? Nothing sinister, no lies were being told. I was the focus of his attention for the two months we were together, and even before. He even said, while we were breaking up ""This time last week I was the happiest I've been in a long time, and now, it just feels strange."" 

Because I'm sick and need to get better. Even now, while I'm wallowing, I sit here and analyze what he said, twisting it to mean that he just wasn't interested, or there was in fact someone better than me. But I know it's not close to the truth.  Why can't I just accept it? I need to get better. It's sad that it took him leaving me to realize it, but I guess we have to lose something to gain something.",,False,,t5_2vgfw,False,,,True,t3_1gwv8d,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1gwv8d/self_loathing_and_how_to_change/,

A few months ago, I met an absolutely amazing guy and we very quickly became best friends.  We would spend every weekend together, with me sleeping over most of the time.  We've gone on a few trips together - DC, NYC, Baltimore, Alabama.  At some point, I started developing feelings for him.  I didn't say anything at first because he was dating another guy and I respected that.  Eventually, though, they started having problems with their relationship and he would turn to me for either advice or comfort.  I tried holding it together, but I eventually told him that I couldn't be impartial because I liked him, and that I might not be the best source of advice.  He understod and was cool about it.


They broke up, and even though I knew better, I let my hopes get the better of me.  It didn't take long before those hopes were crushed and he started seeing another guy.  I met his boyfriend, who was a really nice guy, and I was happy for him.  I was crushed, though.  After they broke up, he started seeing random guys he'd meet on grindr - sometimes it'd lead to them hooking up, sometimes it wouldn't.  All the while, though, I was dying inside.

After a while, he and I eventually talked about how I felt.  He said he understood how I felt and that he felt horribly about it, but that he just didn't have those kinds of feelings for me.  He told me that while he wouldn't rule anything about because he did think about dating me briefly, he just didn't feel that way now.  That wasn't what I wanted to hear, obviously, but I understood and I tried to respect it.


Things were somewhat normal for a little while.  We still hung out every weekend, and I still slept over all the time.  Nothing ever happened except for one night when he must've been incredibly horny and I sucked his dick.  The normalcy lasted for maybe a few weeks before the jealousy started kicking in again.  Any time he went on a date, I would feel depressed and jealous.  He never said anything, but I knew it was hurting our friendship.


Last weekend, we hung out as usual and I slept over.  He had something to do in the morning, so he left me alone in the house to shower and see myself out.  I took the opportunity to leave him a card I had written.  In it, I explained that I loved him, but that I couldn't go on like this.  Every time he went out with someone new, I felt the rejection all over again and the feelings of inadequacy.  I told him that I'd always be there for him, but that I needed to walk away and figure things out.  After he read the card, he told me he understood and that he'd be lucky to date me if he could change the way he feels.  But he can't, and I don't blame him for that.   No one controls the way their emotions work.


It's only been a few days and I already miss him like crazy.  I miss his good morning and good night texts.  I miss talking to him all day at work.  I just miss him.  I hope I did the right thing, but I feel like all I did was lose my best friend.",,False,,t5_2vgfw,False,,,True,t3_1f77y4,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1f77y4/just_ended_a_friendship_hoping_i_made_the_right/,

I recently had to go to a government office to get some paperwork taken care of (Visa paperwork, I live in Japan, yes this is relevant). The wait was right terrible. I kept walking around and finding places to wait for my number to be called. Eventually, I found a nook next to the elevators, and just read a book.

As I'm sitting there, these two guys came around the corner and were holding hands, wrist to wrist. My eyes went from their faces, to their hands, and I felt my own eyebrows go up. They saw that.

Here's what they thought (They let me know): ""Haha, look at that guy, he's actually judging us for being gay."" ""Wow, I can't believe that, in 2013...""

Here's what I thought: ""Whoa, that's the first PDA I've seen in Japan, in two years.""

They were dicking around and loudly talking about how they hate bigots, and that they wish they'd all die (well within earshot of me, throwing subtle insults my way).

Anyways, they kept throwing more abuse at me. I let it go on for around 20 minutes. Then I went up to them (they looked terrified) and just said: ""I'm gay. There's no PDA in Japan, and you two are rude.""

I know I didn't handle it in the most tactful way. But it got them to shut the !@#$ up and they actually didn't retort, which surprised me. They just whimpered out an apology and walked to away into the bowels of the building. But I'm wondering how... how do you even begin to tactfully handle a situation like this? I wanted to throw an olive branch their way, but their language and abuse was just too much to give them an 'it's OK, we're a big gay happy family! And that was just a big gay misunderstanding.'

This monday I finally came out to my parents after a whole year of studying the problem and considering my options...I was even going to a psychologist for mental preparation. I took them there so that, when I would tell them, the psychologist could help me explaining things in case they started freaking out on me. 

Well, it didn't really work much. My mom said that she already suspected, but didn't want to think about it, and she said that for now she doesn't even want to touch the subject and that she is extremely dissapointed in me. My dad was completely surprised, he said that never even crossed his mind. With the help of the psychologist, I tried to tell them that many of my past mental problems (OCD, depression) seemed to originate from my own struggle to not accept myself. I used to feel constantly alone and was always cleaning myself too hard, like my hands and my genitals were always dirty.

But still, they were too shocked to empathize. Psychologist booked one more appointment the next day, and we went back home in complete silence. That night, my parents locked their door, and next day I could hear them crying a lot on the kitchen and talking about something, but I didn't wanna get too close. After that, my dad wanted to have a conversation with me.

He said that this is wrong and that I should be a man, because this is not natural and I would be going against nature and God. He said that I ruined his life and my mother didn't even want to look me in face, because she wasn't feeling well. I insisted a lot on the fact that it wasn't my choice, that I was like that since very little, and though I never had sex with a girl, every time I tried to get closer or make out with one, I felt this feeling of indifference, like it wasn't doing anything for me.

He said I wasn't trying hard enough, and that I should go further to be certain, and that with faith in God, I can do anything. Well, he tried to make me not go to the psychologist, he thought she was putting wrong ideas into my head...he agreed for me to go as long as he went as well. Follow more of her trying to convince him, but he was having none of it. 

In the end, she asked what would he do, if I had sex with a girl, and was still sure of being gay...he only said that I shouldn't let myself be influenced by others and that I should go through with whatever I wanted (but the way he said looked like he wasn't going to accept it if it went to the ""wrong way""). That was the last time I saw my psychologist, because my parents don't want me seeing her anymore. I told him I would try to search for a relationship with a girl or maybe a prostitute to try what he wanted.

See, I'm agreeing with what they want because, although I just turned 25 y/o, I still live with them (don't live in USA, it's normal for people in my country to live with their parents until this age). I don't want to create a bad atmosphere and though I know they won't kick me out, I don't want them doing their best for me to go away from here (Just finished my master's degree, unemployed and short on money at the moment). 

These past days, I've been lethargic and afraid to trust or get close to anyone. My parents at first were worried, they said that they still love me, nothing's gonna happen to me and that I should trust them, but I feel they are very expectant on me finding a girl as soon as possible. My mother is already talking to me and my dad hugs me sometimes, but I don't know if they're like that just because I said I'd try to find a girl.

I decided to tell them because I trusted them, but now, this totally broke my confidence and my hability to trust them or anyone, and this completely killed my libido and I'm not feeling attraction for anyone, man or woman. I'm feeling very alone and I don't really know where to turn to...besides, now they are cranking up their religiousness, talking about God on almost every subject and trying to act like nothing's wrong even with me looking always down.

I don't know, were some of your experiences similar? How did you cope with it? I still want to trust them, but it feels hard to talk about this with them (my mother now tries to listen at least, she wants to be understanding, but is having a hard time and she fears the path I might take...my father answers anything with something like me ""not trying hard enough"")

tl;dr coming out didn't went very well. Parents say they still love me, but expect me to have a relationship with a girl before I can be sure of anything.

He was rimming me then put a finger in and pulled it out real quick and it seemed like he wiped it on my ass.. a few minutes later he said we should jerk off.

I'm not sure if he felt poop in there but that's real awkward, I guess he handled it okay.

People who Top: How often do you run into mud with guys, what do you do? Do you expect me to be clean even the next morning?

People who bottom: How do you prepare yourself for sexytimes, especially when the sexy times might be several hours or a whole night away?

I have lived in very rural North Carolina my whole life (exception being my college years).  I now work in the same rural area I grew up in.  I work a manual labor/blue collar job in a plant for 12 hour rotating shifts 14+ days out of the month.  So not really a good job for meeting other gay men or having a social life.
Speaking of the social part, I can seem pretty socially inept.  I'm definitely not a social butterfly, I'm very quiet when first meeting people because I tend to need to know my audience before I ""come out of my shell"" so to speak.  Mostly because my dry, sarcastic, and crude sense of humor can offend many so I try to keep quiet until I get a feel of the person or people I'm with.  I don't really go out much mostly because I don't have many friends around who like to go out and I don't really know where to go out to meet guys, much less do it by myself.  Plus, I'm also the type who is perfectly fine just lounging around the house playing 360 or watching Netflix all night, which is usually what I end up doing.
The choice in men around here is already slim pickin's and I have a particular taste in men that is rare around here (meaning other ""bros"").  I have always had a problem feeling a little detached from the gay community, especially most of the ones I know around here because I don't go out to the only area gay club (too far and too much trouble for me, prefer bars to clubs anyways) or enjoy many of the same things that they do (my only gay friend got me to go shopping with him because he didn't like the way I dress, I was lost the whole time and can't take an interest in things like fashion or Real Housewives to save my life).  
I'm about to move into my own country bachelor pad on my own for the first time in my life and I have been single for a year so now that I will have my own place it will be nice to have a relationship now that I have a place to spend quality time with a man without having to worry about people like my stepdad being around. 
I'm not one for hooking up often, I mean yeah I do it every now and again and having my own place will be great for that but I'd rather have one guy to focus every bit of my sexual and romantic energies on (plus if I know I'm getting to wine and dine him it is much easier for me to put all my effort into fucking him senseless, I'm just wired like that) than just fuck a different guy I'll never see again every once in a while.  I'd like to find something real, with substance.
I'm sure at least one other guy here has managed to find love under similar circumstances, any advice for a fellow bro?  Besides ""Move,"" because that's the advice I keep getting out here in the real world.

1352423992.0,22,self.askgaybros,12w0t8,Found out a coworker is gay...need help,WRXBro,26,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/12w0t8/found_out_a_coworker_is_gayneed_help/,"First off, i'm trying out this sub with reservations. I don't think it was ever a good idea to split off advice from the main sub seeing as how a lot of bros don't have the resources to get gay-related advice in their daily lives and they've now been cut off from thousands of /r/gaybros readers who will, out of apathy, never see these posts; and while there are gay and relationship advice subs, the people in those subs would have a hard time understanding the unique position we find ourselves in of being both gay and masculine...that being said:

I've been on OKCupid for a while now and recently recieved one of those emails that shows you a few guys in your area to try and pique your interest. Usually i look at it quickly and delete it, but this time i saw someone i knew on there...a coworker.

He's new to being more open about his sexuality, but i got the sense from his profile that he may only be out to a handful of people and definitely not at work. I'm in the same situation and to be honest, it was a little awkward seeing him on there. I debated whether or not i should message him all day and then finally decided to, but he had deleted his account. I'm only speculating, but i think that maybe he deleted it as a reaction to seeing my profile. I asked an ex to go on there and take a look and it's confirmed that it wasn't just a block but a full on deletion.

Our work situation is a little unique. We are in the same department, but different sections. He works in a building about ten miles away and we hardly ever have any contact. I am management in my section while he is a technician in his. My section does work closely with his section on a daily basis, but my contact with his group is only warranted a few times a year.

So, now i have no way to contact him outside of work. I really want to let him know there's nothing to be worried about as far as me knowing and i'd also like to get to know him more. I have a little crush on him but just being friends would be cool. I don't know any other masc gay guys so having someone to relate to would be awesome.

My question is this: Is it too much for me to email him at work asking for his personal email address? I was thinking something really discrete and straight-forward just asking for his email and letting him know that it's perfectly fine if he doesn't want to share it. If he does send it, then i'd know where to go from there...but should i hit him up or should i just let it go completely? I don't want things to be any more awkward for him and i just don't know if contacting him through work email is going overboard.

**Edit:** Even though i have concerns about the existence of this sub, i am subscribed and plan to fully participate here.

**Edit 2:** After a couple comments I had decided to just send him a simple email with my email address saying I'm giving it to him if he wants to use it, period. It seems that the overwhelming consensus is to just let it go and that's just what I'll do. While I believe life is fleeting and I see great opportunity for friendship or possibly more here and want to take action, I see that I may be trying to force the situation. 

**Edit 3:** It half way worked itself out today. I'd been putting off visiting his site for a couple months to pass some info and since I was near his building I took the opportunity to swing by. I showed that I was able to keep things completely professional and I think it reassured him that I didn't treat him any differently, pretty much acted like nothing had ever happened. He and his coworker did approach me about problems they were having with some of the guys I oversee and we talked about that for a while. I later sent them both an email stating that coming to me with any issues is okay and that I take discretion very seriously. I also provided them both with my personal cell number to use at any time for any reason. I didn't word it exactly like that but I kept it completely work related. Hopefully he picks up on those two things and it eases any anxiety he may be having. 

For now I'm going to let it go. If he hops back online I'll talk to him then, either that or I'll wait a while to let him process everything and then casually ask if he wants to hang out sometime, *in person.*

Anyone ever have this?,Khaki_Shorts,22,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1j4x4a/bottomed_amazingly_but_i_had_to_stop_because_it/,"This is my first boyfriend and first the person I ever get sexual with. I thought I'd top when we got sexual, but that didn't work at first. I was anxious and nervous for it so it failed the first time. I did top him once, but it wasn't that great. I guess it was because it was my first successful time topping, but I was still a little nervous and anxious. So we went at it for a while with me as the bottom. This was my third time doing it successfully.

We're going for a long time, and I feel like cumming or like I need to pee, both (more so cumming) with intensity. I felt like I was at the edge, but was stuck there before cumming and my dick wasn't hard. Last time I bottomed, my dick was hard the entire time. I did try to stroke myself, but that made me tense up and difficult to take a dick. I was enjoying it just fine, though.

It was a whole different sensation than what I'm used to, and it was pretty intense so I asked to stop a couple times. My boyfriend asked if it started to hurt, but I told him it felt almost too good. He said I should just keep going and that's what bottoming is. I get it, but it was still pretty on the edge if that makes sense. He was close to cumming, which impressed me that I was able to take him that far (he told me in the past he has never came from topping), but we eventually stopped after 40-60 minutes or so. I felt like maybe I could have came from bottoming, but I was soft and not there yet it seemed. We just finished by jacking off.

I don't consider myself a bottom just yet. I don't really like to label as one or the other. Even my boyfriend has done both, but said he would rather bottom for me. Eventually I wanted to try bottoming and have done so a couple times. In the past he said he usually tops. I had to try bottoming before being able to top, it's my first time having sex with someone regularly.

Essentially, if anyone asks, I tell them the truth and the truth occasionally slips out regardless of a prompt. I haven't had many problems with bigotry or homophobia around here and I'm grateful for that.

I know that a large part of the gay intimacy (I'm not labeling it as dating, considering that's not where all of my qualms lie) community is very centered upon the concept of hooking up and sex in general. Now, there's nothing wrong with sex. As much as it may come off that way, I'm not condescending in any regard. I'm a sex positive individual in every way, besides the fact that I myself am not so apt to go into it personally, if you get what I mean. 

The thing is, I don't find myself looking forward to sex very much at all and I don't want to even have sex on the third date or so, let alone hookup. In my current mindset, which, granted, is capable of being changed, sex would be something I would do to please my partner more than something I would ever want myself. Maybe I'm just not into it yet or whatever. Who knows? I'm without a doubt sexually attracted to men and at times I fantasize about sex itself, yet the idea of myself going about and having sex just doesn't sit right with me...

How can I survive in an environment where sex is so expected?  Soon enough, I'll be out on my own in a different world in college and as an adult as well. I might find someone or maybe someone will find me. Maybe I'll go to a gay bar, even. Maybe I'll fall in love or have some insane crush that's somehow requited.

But I'm just feeling really down as of late. I came out a few years ago and I've learnt quite a lot about myself since then. But all those years in the closet have really scarred me.

I totally repressed my sexuality - to the point where I really wouldn't think of hot guys in a sexual way. I mean, I found them sexually attractive, but that's where it stops. I don't fantasise about having sex with them or get turned on. And that causes problems, since guys tend to 'go for the kill' when I'm not ready.

I also learned not to second-guess myself. I tried the whole hook-up scene that most guys are into. I thought that maybe I would like it if I gave it a try, but it only confirmed to me that it's not my thing. I tried lowering my standards and being more open to new things, but that's not something that you can choose to do. For anyone thinking of doing the same thing: Don't jump the gun, do things when you want to.

Another thing I realised about myself was that I tend to value long term benefits over short term - in general. I've never been a fan of the 'live fast, die young' attitude that most people my age have. And I have the same values when it comes to relationships/sex. I guess I have the attitude that if you restrict yourself a little bit, then it benefits you in the long run (eg. not eating fast food). I think a lot of people jump into relationships because the sex is good. Whereas I've always come at things from a friendship point of view. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I believe that although things don't come along often for me; when they do, they're likely to be much better.

With all that said, I guess the problem for me is that there are so few guys looking for anything more than casual sex. And sure, I keep telling myself that something is waiting around the corner - but it never is.

I still haven't lost my 'top virginity'. I'm a reasonably horny person in general, but my sex drive was lost while I was in the closet. It maybe sounds a bit silly, but I honestly think topping would bring back some of my confidence and general motivation. But having sex with someone random just won't do it for me; I need someone who I actually like. However that's hard to come by for me.

It just seems to be an endless cycle of nothingness and loneliness. How many years does it take just to find a guy that you just click with? I think that I'm just too different in what I want to find anyone. Coming out has made little difference to my life. I'm still hopelessly single and lonely.

Lastly, my PhD studies are finishing in a few months. I've come to hate it, yet I need to find a job and I'm hardly qualified for anything. I basically have no papers, so getting a post-doc is next to impossible (especially as there are no vancancies anywhere at the moment). But I'm not qualified to do anything else without going through university again.

I wouldn't say that I'm suicidal, but I wouldn't really care if I was run over by a bus tomorrow.

Meanwhile I've had to pay 400 in rent just to have the privilege of living here since I was 16, on top of taking care of all my own bills.  

I quit my job just over a year ago to go back to school full time.  Parents went ballistic.  Since I was still at an age where the government considered my parents financially responsible for my school bills, I got virtually nothing in financial aid.

When I was about 15 I was pretty much convinced I was straight and Kind of fell head over heals for this one girl that I had known a long time and we got pretty serious I was pretty much a member of her family at this point and her family was one of those types that loves to joke around and usually I could take it and dish it back pretty well but the only jokes I kind of took sour were the ones where they made fun of me saying I was definitely gay and placing bets on when I'll come out of the closet. In middle school I was harassed a lot and a lot of people thought I was gay and so Iv always been a little sensitive about that kind of stuff. We went out for close to a year and then we broke up pretty roughly 

Since then Iv come to terms with my sexuality and of course high school was much better than middle school and no one even cares what your sexuality is and most people think I'm straight because I went out with this girl for so long. So its safe to say that people questioning or even thinking about my sexuality is pretty much non-existent.  At first this was a huge relief for me because it meant I never really had to consciously act a certain way or be afraid to be flamboyant at times. 

lately the more I accept my sexuality the more it feels like I need to come out. The benefits of coming out all seem to be there for me and I have a great group of friends that I became close to through my schools choir program and actually 2 of them are gay themselves and the group is entirely fine with it. I know if I were to come out I would be accepted and nothing really would change other than me feeling comfortable talking about who I think is attractive.   

However, For some reason I'm having lots of anxiety of the thought of people beginning to discuss the status of my sexuality again. It feels like people have finally stopped talking about sexuality to me and I'm really scared that if I come out then its going to become a topic of conversation again. I know it seems weird but I really enjoy the feeling that sexuality doesn't come up at all when people think of me. I feel like people know me now as just a guy who likes to make people laugh and I get really anxious of the thought of anyone even associating a sexuality with me. 

I also don't like the thought of people who previously thought I must have been gay and have only recently it feels like come to accept that I'm straight hearing this news. I have a fear of them thinking about that part of me for some reason.  

on top of that I'm really scared that everyone knows and bringing it up would be completely pointless and actually just make my sexuality more of an issue in my life. 

TL:DR I feel like I'm caught in the middle of wanting to come out and not wanting to feel like I did when I was young and people made guesses at my sexuality.

I'm 30, and for alost all of my life, if I'm in a room full of people in a social situation, I'm totally alone.  Like I can't walk up and join a conversation.  For example, tonight at the local bar, there was a video game night.  That should totally be my crowd being the geeky game and comics guy that I am.  However, I kind of sat in the background, listened to the conversations around me, but I couldn't bring myself to jump in (even though I really wanted to) or even join the circles.  

The odd thing, is that I'm totally the opposite at work.  My job requires me to interact with people for a living, and at work, I'm outgoing and sociable and aggressive and am always joining in the conversations.  Even when I start a new job or an im a new professional situation, like I just did a few weeks ago, I'm in the thick of it within a few hours.  But outside of work, and especially in situations where I don't know anyone, I'm totally hidden.  To the point where once when I did join the circle, and I finally did comment an hour later, someone said ""Oh, I didn't even realize you were here"".

I'm pretty confident with myself, I could probably be in better shape, but I'm ok with it and with the way I look.  I just have this paralysis that manifests outside of my professional life.

I've been having this issue my whole life, but I'm not sure if anyone else has wondered this about themselves.

I'm 24, realized I was gay when I was 12ish, have been out to my friends and family since I was 16, and I've never denied being gay to anyone since. Now, I don't know if this means that I'm a self-hating gay person, but I greatly enjoy not being immediately perceived as gay person by other people. I prefer that people get to know me as a person before they associate me with a sexual identity (even if they are gay friendly).

I'm sure I'm not the only one here who gets confused for a straight person, but I've found that I really make this work to a good end (at least I hope so). What I do is befriend people that don't like gay people and kind of win them over as my friend before I tell them that I'm gay. I've seen this really take some people aback and force them to really think about how irrational it is to hate gay people, but I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. They'll admit that ""I'm not like most gay people and that's why they like me,"" but I don't know if I'm inspiring any real tolerance in people who would otherwise avoid me or hurt me in some way if they knew.

To cite a specific anecdote, I once lived in Spain and I was friends with this Russian guy. We became fast friends and we always hung out all of the time. One day in school, we got into a heated discussion about gays in our class and he asked me, ""why do you defend the gays so much?"" and I asked, ""why do you think?!"". He turned bright red and left the classroom.

For a month after, he avoided me, switched out of my class, and never returned my calls. I felt so sad when this happened and cried a lot, but I decided to give him space. After that month, he called me and apologized, but said he never met a gay person before and felt deceived that I never told him. Our friendship is intact today, but it was a really awful feeling and I felt that it was my duty as a friend to instill some acceptance into him for who I was.

I guess my concern is two-fold and can be summed up as:

So I ask this, and wonder if anyone feels the same way I do: Can we have a requirement to include a **question** in the title that gives at least some details about the topic someone would like discussed? (At least to the best of their ability?)
-
I feel this will benefit the subreddit and will encourage more people to post help.  

EDIT: Examples  
**Bad titles**  
- I need some help  
- So I met a guy and have a question  
- Grindr question  
- DC gaybros  
**Good titles**  
- I came out on Facebook, but lost friends because of it. Does anyone have suggestions on how to approach them?  
- I have a 'friend-with-benefits' but I think I've fallen for him. Has anyone else experienced this and done anything about it?  
- My mother and father are ultra-conservative, so what is the best way to tell them I'm gay?  
- Can anyone who knows the Atlanta area tell me where some good bars are to meet other bro-type guys?

The harassment comes from all kinds of guys, both flitty and non, and he's locked into the job for reasons that take too long to explain.

His hatred for the bar has manifested itself as a hatred for what seems like gay men in general, and he's starting to show signals of inflating his masculinity: wearing a backwards baseball cap everywhere he goes, adding more ""dudes"" and ""mans"" into his vocabulary, complaining about guys who couldn't pass for straight. These things alone wouldn't be so bad, aside from that last bit, but together they're like he's grasping for gimmicks, ways to hide his gayness. We've been getting into a lot of arguments about how he sees gay men, especially since a lot of his complaints could easily be said about me, because I couldn't pass for straight in most eyes.

Until he gets out of the bar (I'm not even confident that that'll change anything), what do the gaybros think I should say/do?

About 10 months ago I was out with friends at a gay bar and got rather intoxicated.  I met a cute guy at the bar and we started dancing and making out. Eventually he asked me to go back to his place and I agreed.  We had sloppy drunk sex which was completely unmemorable(for both of us I'm sure). The next morning we got coffee and exchanged numbers.  He was really cute so I was hoping that I would get the chance to see him again.  I sent him a message midweek asking him to have dinner with him and he never responded.

Flash forward 10 months, I receive a message on OkCupid from the same boy.  I didn't recognize him and we chatted back and forth on there.  Eventually we exchanged numbers and when I put his number in my phone I realized it was a number I already had and knew who it belonged to.  We made plans to go out and I didn't say a word about it.  I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable about it.  We went out on our 'first date' and after a few drinks he confessed that he also became aware of the situation when he entered my number into his phone.  We both laughed and it was actually a great date.

After the date, I shared this story with a handful of friends who were all shocked that I wasn't offended by the entire situation because he never called me back after our first encounter.  Now I can't stop thinking about it and wonder if I should ask him why he didn't call me back the first time.

I've always been extremely attracted to him, but never acted on it since he had a boyfriend. Still, I fell in love with him. Unfortunately. I had to start avoiding and ignoring him because it was too painful.

I've probably never been more in love with a guy. Even the feelings I had for some of my long term boyfriends are incomparable. So when I heard he broke up with his guy, naturally I got excited. 

We both got really drunk at a party and eventually I ended up in his bed. We had a good time, but while I was pulling off his clothes, he said that he ""wasn't ready for anything serious"". At that moment I was drunk and I didn't care, pure excitement was running through my veins. 

The morning after was pretty cozy. We had sex again, cuddled, made some breakfast. Afterwards we went over to a friend to chill out and get over our hangovers. All was good.

I didn't want to be pushy, so I decided not to text or to call him. I genuinely thought that I'd hear something from him. I didn't.

Day after day I felt worse. I couldn't stop thinking about what a stupid decision it was to have sex with him. For the last two nights, all I've been doing is crying in the arms of my friends, rambling about him. 

My friends were alarmed by how emotional I am about this. I'm not really the type of person that likes to show his feelings, but it just kept pouring out uncontrollably. I've probably never felt more shitty.

While talking to one of my best friends, who is also my ex boyfriend, I found out that he asked his ""permission"" to have sex with me the day before it happened. I was shocked to learn that it was all premeditated.

Last night we saw each other again. We didn't talk about it. He was just nice to me like he always is. I felt even worse. I can hardly believe that he isn't aware of how I feel. 

My friends convinced me that I need to talk to him about how I feel. Even though it's a terrifying thing to do, because I realise that he'll break my heart more than ever. Still, as soon as I got up this morning, I courageously texted him that I really needed to talk things over. I haven't heard back from him.

I don't know if anyone can give me some useful advice. But if you do, or you went through something similar, please tell me.

Throwaway account by the way, because I'm still paranoid about pouring my heart out to the internet.

I'll get straight to the point.

Do any other uncircumcised guys have problems with getting over-stimulated and completely shutting down during sexy times? It has happened to me on several occasions now and its really frustrating. I am accustomed to moving my foreskin back and forth when I am sexing myself up, and it works really well; but when a guy tries to get things started he will just move the foreskin out of the way and move his hand back and forth over the tip. This quickly evolves into me shaking and spasming and then shutting down before reaching orgasm, and at this point the moment is pretty much dead for me. The same thing will actually happen when I replicate the same method on myself. And seriously how is it even possible that a guy could somehow make it difficult even to get himself off?

I have tried bringing it up once, but the guy seemed to get all confused and awkward for some reason; since then I have been reluctant to start coaching people in bed, as I don't think men are accustomed to other men having difficulty climaxing.

If anyone else has had any similar issues, I would appreciate any thoughts or advice.

When he looks at his circle of friends to hang out with, only one friend is left out of all of his high school friends (lots of fallout and drama) and he lives several towns over and is engaged. 

One weekend while I was away, our roommates were heading out for a couple nights and as they were leaving, they asked my bf if he had any plans to hang out with anyone. His one friend was busy so he didn't have anything to do...literally nothing to do the entire weekend. My roommate just told him straight up that he needs more friends and my bf agreed with him. 

He's been absorbed into my circle of friends, they all love him, but he's not close enough with my bff to hang out with him without me, and the rest are women. He doesn't have his own group of guys to hang out with. I told him he needs to start going out and meeting people, but how do you do that as an adult? He's too shy to go to a bar by himself and strike up conversation, he doesn't have any coworkers his age, and he's not in school anymore to meet classmates. It's like his own personal ""I Love You, Man"". He just needs to find more people to hang out with.

A few days ago, my ex suggested I come over and talk to him about some problems he was having. I realized that this might result in sex, and I was okay with that. After we talked, he almost broke down into tears. Later we were just laying in his bed in silence, I rubbed his back a little and he eventually took my hand and placed it on his junk. We then proceeded to have sex, and I was initially consenting to that... but what we ultimately ended up doing was not anything I would've consented to. He started having really rough sex with me, sticking his fingers in my butt while he topped me, punching/slapping me in the face, hitting me in the chest, calling me a whore, pushing my head into the bed, biting me very hard, pulling my hair very hard, etc. I wanted to tell him to stop but felt that if I did, he would hurt me even more. I was really scared. He didn't kiss me - after there was no affection. He just rolled onto the other side of the bed and fell asleep. In the morning he left a towel on the bed. I took a shower and got changed while he played video games with his roommate.

I've never felt so awful and disgusted with myself after having sex. I don't ever want to see this person again. I'm not really sure what to do at this point... Was this rape?

So here's the deal. My best friend and I are both married and unhappy. We originally bonded over this displeasure for where we are in life as well as our wives are so so similar. Anyway, about 2 years ago we both kinda came out to eachother. We have both felt same sex attraction for most of our lives, and ended up going through the motions of dating and getting married because we thought being gay was wrong and would go away (really conservative families, we both still hold our faith in high regard, which is confusing I know). After that ""outing"" we got pretty close, always meeting for drinks or coffee to talk about how we are trying to cope with these lives we feel trapped in. If he gets a divorce he'll loose his job too (it's complicated) and I have 2 kids.

Anyway, for as long as I've known him i've had a huge crush on him. Everything about him is what I want in a partner, plus he's amazingly attractive. I think I might actually love him. Well on New Years Eve he texted me and confessed that he has feelings for me and fantasizes about us being together and intimate. This totally rocked my world, right? So we texted until the wee hours of the morning and then ended up meeting for coffee when we woke up. Awkward conversation made us retreat to the car to drive around. And he kissed me. And my world exploded. We drove around a bit, groping eachothers cocks and making out a ton. Then parked and he climbed on top of me and we starting grinding. And then we stopped. Both scared that this could ruin our friendship. It was like we were caught up in this new revelation and our hormones took over.

Now I can't stop thinking about him. I want him in my arms again. I want to feel his lips on mine. But at the same time, I have a wife and kids who I love. But I feel zero connection with my wife, physically. Actually even emotionally lately. He's probably going to divorce his wife, but he's afraid of loosing his job. What I'm most scared of is loosing him as a friend. I love him deeply, in what way I'm not sure, but I care. A lot. 

I'm at a coffee shop, waiting for him to come in an hour and I don't know what to do. We haven't really talked since our make-out session two days ago. I think he's scared and trying to back up and salvage our friendship. But this is a game changer right? I mean, what do we do? Where do we go from here? I want him to know that I really care, but I don't want to totally scare him away.

Oh, and I did send him a journal entry I wrote... https://penzu.com/p/a9b445fd

So... if you made it this far, can anyone help me? I don't want to loose him. But I might love him.

So recently I decided, bugger it, I'll bottom then! Of course my expectations of feeling less manly has not materialised so I'm quite happy except for one problem. My boyfriend just has no drive at all to make our relationship work on sexual level. 

Example, tonight he came in, I had prepared myself, douched, had a wee play to loosen things up and he complains about my brothers plans for tomorrow without batting an eyelid, or showing any sign of excitement, of course by this point I'm feeling abit despondent. I then mention we need more lube and could he get some tomorrow and he just complains how it is so expensive and that he has better things to spend money on, essentially saying that sex with me isn't worth time or £10. 

So now I've lost my horn and I'm raging. I feel like our relationship hasn't advanced at all sexually in the last 2 years and I don't want to just wank next to someone and the occasional blow job for the rest of my life. I need more, I've said this multiple times! 

I love him, but it is getting to the end here, I don't want to be a cheat but I'm feeling pushed into that corner so I'd have to dump him :( I cannot believe I'm thinking about it because I do truly love him. I'm so stuck.

This week my boyfriend went away for a week for work, and it also happens that I've gotten my results. Turns out I have chlamydia. Worst news of the year so far if you ask me. 

So here's the deal, it's quite easy to treat and I'm not to worried about my health or his health. Thing easy I need to tell him. He's away and he does have anxiety issues, which are treated, but I fear telling him will have horrible impacts on our couple. 

So I do I tell him? Do I wait for him to come back? And even so, how do I deal with his anxiety? I'm kind of getting scared this is going to make a huge mess in my life...

Advice needed.,OMSK91,22,4,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1ei3qd/boring_relationship_advice_needed/,"I really never thought I would be feeling like this and even less asking for advice for something like this; so please bare with me. 

I'm 3 months into my first relationship with someone. For a long time I always thought I would never find someone... So this is kind of a big deal for me. At the beginning of this relationship I kind of felt a bit hesitant about the guy I was seeing (I even asked for your advice before). My feelings towards the guy started growing more and more. I really really love this guy. Problem is... I feel like the relationship I'm in is kinda boring... I just kind of feel like I do more than him. 

Let me explain a little more.... 

It's always me the one that is trying to talk about something. 

It's always me that arranges when we're meeting or what we're doing 

It's always me taking him to new places or events  

I know he enjoys being with me but if I don't talk he doesn't try to talk. If I don't ask him when he's free to meet, he won't ask me or tell me when we're meeting. If I don't plan something he would just want to do nothing. If I ask him something or tell him to plan something his only response is ""whatever you want"" or whatever you like. If I ask if something is okay with him he says as long as I'm okay with it. 

I know I may be overreacting. I feel bad (really bad) that I'm feeling like this about the relationship because I love him and I know he loves me. I just don't know if I'm expecting too much or I'm being unreasonable. It's just frustrating that he doesn't seem to put as much effort as I do or he is not as direct and demanding with me as I'd like him to be. 

I'm not really sure what to do. I do love him and really like him. I feel bad that I may be overreacting. 

Any advice?

I'm a twenty year old uni student and I have a friend (lynch me later), and who's awesome and straight. He came into my life about two months ago, immediately following my first heartbreak and our 'bromance' has just snowballed since. 

We spend an obscene amount of time together and on several occasions, he has paid for my night out, and not expected anything in return. I'm pointing this out, because this completely different to the friendships that I have with my other male friends.

The reason I'm looking for advice is because, I have fallen for him, he knows this, and yet, despite his saying that he is straight, I feel like we have this weird sexual charge between us.

I can't seem to figure him out though and we've spoken about this and he insists it's just a crush and it will pass. I've also suggested we don't hang out so intimately, but we seem to wind up back together again. There have been a few examples of where we've gotten really close (although not strictly sexual) we've had drunken kisses, we've shared the same bed (he insisted, despite my suggestion that I could walk home) and he convinced me to sleep up the top with him and we ended up spooning. Recently however, we were watching a film and we'd both been drinking. I had begun to get quite tactile, without being invasive, just attempting to stroke his hair or arm, but he didn't reciprocate, stating that he was ticklish etc. I left it and ended up walking home. The next morning however, he apologised to me for being boring, which has completely confused me.

Short story, I can't figure out if this guy is into me, or simply just looking out for me, and he's going away tomorrow for 15 days, and this will have been the longest we've not seen each other.

For example, he was really nervous about meeting me to the point where he almost flaked on me (he was really late the first time and he said it was because he was in his car, building up courage. He hasn't been late since, though).  

Initially, I thought it was cute.  But then it began to rear its ugly head again.  He got weird at a party we went to because I had to leave him alone for a few minutes while I went to pee.  I came back, he's nowhere to be found... Except in my effing car where he went and pouted because he didn't feel included.   He's done shit like these twice now and each time, he initially comes at me as if I'm not doing my part.  Guys, I practically surgically attached him to me and made an effort to introduce him to everyone.  Fuck, he met at least 20 people both times.  

Guys, I'm just an average dude, nothing special.  I'm not the '10' he calls me all the time when compared to his '3.'  He's not even a 3, I find him *incredibly fucking sexy* and I don't know how to get him to realize this.  Sex doesn't help, either, which is almost funny considering we have fantastic chemistry betwixt the sheets.   However, he makes an effort to wear clothes when we do it and he'll have the light off.  The sex is still good, but recently, I've been having problems enjoying it because while I love topping him, I don't like it when I feel like he's covering himself.... Does that make sense?  God, the last time we had sex, I went through the motions like a robot.  

(For the record, I'm not complaining about someone finding me attractive, I have a problem when its exaggerated with a layer of... assumption?, ie. assuming I'm just itching for someone 'more attractive.')

He stopped with these pedestal comments for a while, but a few days ago we're at a coffeehouse that's right smack in the middle of the gay village, right?  Suddenly, it's all about how guys are secretly wondering why we are together.   He says because a guy smiled at me, people don't assume we're together because he's so ugly.  His words.  This drives me insane and makes me sad because he's really not.  He might not be conventionally attractive, but none of that matters and I've sat him down and been really serious about conveying this to him (in addition to how I feel about him, how my friends like him, how he's nowhere near as awful as he thinks he is).  He doesn't seem to get it and I'm at a point now where I'm wondering if I've exhausted all my options and its time to move on.   What do you guys think?

Because it's a wall of text I'll include a **TL;DR:**  A guy I'm seeing is awesome except for his insecurity, which makes him very socially awkward and constantly having the expectation that I'm going to leave him when I realize he's not good enough for me.  Which isn't going to happen unless he stops with this, so I want to help and feel like I'm going about it wrong.

I've [25] been dating an awesome guy [24] for about 4-5 months now. We have a blast kicking it. And this is the longest relationship any of us have been in. I've dated guys in the past (he's dated a ton more) but I still feel pretty fresh to this.. 

So he's much more into the ""scene/lifestyle"" than I am. And I sometimes feel he defines himself way too much by his sexuality.. When I know there is so much more to him than that, I've seen it. But when we are out with friends or meeting new people he always seems to pull the gay card out left and right..

At first I thought I should give this guy a chance, because he's really cool, and I should open myself up to someone a little different and maybe learn something about myself. I did and he definitely grew on me. But as time goes on it still continues to bother me and we've talked about it, he's aware of it and recognizes it is an insecurity of his etc.. After months of dating I am at the point where I wonder if this relationship is worth continuing, is it fair to both of us if I'm not really feeling it the same way he is.

The date was originally for six but we were worried about getting into the venue since they had stopped taking reservations. Having figured this out finally, I messaged him around 4 oclock to say we should bump it up half an hour to 5:30.

Unfortunately, I got there around 5:15 and spent the next 10 minutes trying to convince my phone to send a message to him to let him know I'd arrived in the area. When it finally came through the response was panic: he'd lost track of time.

I decided to stick around and wait for him but never got a response or indication of when he thought he might arrive. There's only so much to do when it's -20 degrees outside, so when 6:00 rolled around and he hadn't shown up, I expressed my condolences and left for home.

When I came out of the subway about 30 minutes later, I had 5 missed calls and a voicemail, apologizing and hoping I'd go out to dinner with him instead. By this point I was almost home (did I mention the cold?) so I sent him a message suggesting we reschedule and left it at that.

I haven't chatted with him since that night and I'm just wondering two things:

Anyways, I'm gonna be heading back to college on Wednesday. I just came out this past May, so I'm still new to being out... anyways, I go to a small college (~7,000) in Central Illinois, and I have no idea how to go about meeting other gay men. I'm much more interested in a relationship than just casual sex, and Grindr hasn't been much help. We do have a gay straight alliance, but it's essentially just a group of students that want to run pride parades all over campus.. not really my thing. I'd really like to actually start dating now that I'm out, but I have no idea how to go about finding other gay men.

Theoretically Grindr could become much more useful once everyone is back on campus, since they would show up due to the proximity, but I feel like Grindr is pretty much exclusively for NSA sex... :/

I am 21 and a student at X.

To date, I have told two people I'm gay. Both of them are female and the situations are pretty identical. While downtown freshmen year, they both started hitting on me. Both times, I ignored it and pretended like I didn't notice. By the end of the night both times, the girls were drunk and pretty assertively told me that I should come back to their dorm rooms. It was to the point where I would have had to tell the truth or flatly rejected them. Not interested in losing friends, both times I drunkenly whispermumbled to them that I was gay. I felt bad, as they both seemed slightly put off by it and were probably embarrassed that they had been coming on so hard. Both times, I felt 1000x more embarrassed than they did and also felt pretty ashamed, anxious, sad/angry. Both times, I found a reason to leave pretty soon after I told them. 

My freshmen year, I met a group of guys that are 2-3 years older than me. They are what I think of as typical straight guys at X, into trucks, hunting, fishing, football etc (I am also into a lot of these things, we also have similar tastes in music and drugs). I became good friends with the group of guys and was hanging out with them regularly. 

One day, one of the guys commented on how many ""hot girls"" I knew and that were posting to my facebook etc.. He asked why I never brought any around and I made up some bullshit about how they weren't into drugs/whatever and so that's why I didn't.

Later the same day, the same guy and I are driving to get some stuff. He brings it up again and basically says that there is ""no way"" that someone has that many platonic relationships with attractive females and asked if I was gay. I haha'd and said no. He wasn't convinced at all and told me that it was fine, he didn't care. I reiterated no and we never talked about it again. 

Several months later, I find myself hanging out with them less and less. I pretty much stopped initiating contact. When they do, I have found reasons to be busy. I really don't care if anyone knows, but I am also not interested AT ALL in discussing it with anyone. **Is it acceptable to let someone know that I am gay and also that I don't want to talk about it?** 

In the past, my coming out experiences made me feel anxious, depressed and angry - certainly not relief or liberation. I *really* do not want to tell them that I am gay, however I also really don't want to be the obviously closeted kid. I know that if my friend asked, it's because he has a strong suspicion. I also know that I have been ostracizing myself from them since the incident because of my own pathetic insecurities and I fucking hate it. Is there a low key way to let them know without ruining our friendship?

**TL;DR** Since coming out to someone for the first time 2 years ago, I feel like I am further in the closet than I ever have been before. It is like I am so afraid of being rejected that I feel unable to even put myself out there to be rejected in the first place. But like I said.. I really just don't want to discuss it with anyone and it actually makes me angry/anxious that I have some sort of responsibility to let everyone know I like dicks in my mouth. I also don't understand why I was literally unable to say ""yea"" when he asked me if I was gay. It was like I was a deer caught in the headlights and instinctually blurted no.

sidenote: I have been at parties with them were girls have brought obviously gay friends along. They aren't rude but they certainly aren't friendly and there is obviously a certain amount of disdain felt. Don't tell me things will stay the same, I know they won't.

My bf and I have been together for awhile (about 1.5 years on-and-off) and things have been going very well for the past few months. I am completely out to my family and friends (who are all 100% supportive), and he has met them several times. To his family, though, with the exception of his two brothers, I am just his ""friend."" He claims that they have no idea we are together, and that they would be very against it. His family is actively involved in their church, and he has said that he would eventually marry a woman instead of ever coming out—edit: he knows that this isn't true, just putting it out there to show how black-and-white he's looking at it. It seems to him like his only options are to either come out to his parents and have his life fall apart or just stay closeted forever and keep them blissful.

Besides his parents and immediate family, he is pretty much fully out. We're university students and all of our friends here know, and we even have gone with friends to pride for the past two years. His brothers (one older, one younger) both know and hang out with us often, and everything is pretty much out in the open all the time except when I'm with other members of his family, where I have to be careful not to so much as say the word gay.

From my perspective, it seems like his parents and close relatives are all pretty aware, and even if not it seems to me like they'd be pretty quick to come around and be supportive. His aunt, for example, pulled me aside to ask me if I was his ""roommate,"" then gave me a smile and a wink when I avoided answering. His mom, too, said ""wow, we've been seeing a lot of you lately,"" the last time I saw her, with a sort of *mom-knows-everything* tone in her voice.

We have tried to switch hit. And according to him, I am fairly good at bottoming. It is not painful or uncomfortable, but it doesn't ""work""? I get almost jo pleasure from it.

About a month ago I told my best friend, who was receptive to it. Huge thanks goes out to you Gaybros for that, you guys gave me the courage and support to finally make it happen! Fast forward a month, and I finally decide to go meet someone that I met through Grindr. 

I spoke to him for several days. We kept the conversation pretty clean, but it was clear we were both very interested. He's 23, I'm 21, we're both very masculine, and we're both still working our way out of the closet. 

He's dated guys though, and I've never even kissed a guy before. You might question ""how do you know you're gay if you've never been with a guy?"" But that's a dumb question. I just know. 

I meet him on his way back from work one night to see a movie, and he's dressed all nice in a buttoned up shirt and slacks. He looks just like his picture, very handsome. I shake his hand, he smiles, and we make some small talk going into the theater. I was nervous as hell, but I didn't think I let it show much.

The theater only had a few other people in it. We chatted some more during the previews, and when it started we just sat and watched it together. Movie was really good though (Oblivion). Got up and left, and spoke a little more outside. 

I started walking to my car slowly, and he walked with me. We get up to it and I let him in, he had to park kinda far away at the other end of the lot. I drove around and stopped by his car, put it in park. I looked over to him to thank him for coming out to meet me, and he leaned over and kissed me!

As soon as it registered to me what was happening, I guess I blushed pretty hard... he stopped, and his eyes eyes sort of smiled and he half laughed, ""Don't be scared!"" Then he kissed me again, just for a few seconds. He stopped, got out and thanked me back, and I told him to have a good night. 

We've been texting/calling each other for the past few days. We want to do something again, and maybe go a little bit further :) 

This was the first time a guy has ever kissed me, or been intimate with me in any way. And damn, did it feel good.

**UPDATE**

So amidst all of this, I've also been preparing to move out of the apartment I'm in now and into one a little bit further from work. Today I moved most of my stuff, and I'm planning to finish tomorrow. Need to figure out how to move my bed...

Anyway. I get back to my current address and I start messaging this guy again. He works late and he was on his way home. I asked him if he wanted to hang out and watch a movie, maybe have a few beers. He was excited at the idea, so I texted him the name of my community, and he called me. He really wants to, but he suggested we do it another night because we both have to get up pretty early for work tomorrow. Plus I'm a little bit out of the way coming from his job to his house, and he described where he lived.

And it's **LITERALLY ACROSS THE STREET** from the apartment community I'm moving into!!! We couldn't stop laughing over the phone. 

I'm so stoked, bros. This is mind-boggling. Had to share.

A little quick information about me. 21 year old male, with ED. I've had ED for quite a few years it would seem, since about 16/17 (though without quite really... realizing it, as I always just bottomed). ED is just one of those tricky things that can be hard to find a root problem. I have low testosterone, and so I have just recently started working on replacement therapy with my shit-tier urologist (who is shortly being replaced). And while I am ever hopeful that one day I can unleash my inner top at long last, I am trying to maintain a sense of realism that this may... well. This may just not be the fix I need.

Here's the situation. I just recently met a phenomenal guy. He's cute and quite a catch, and everything just feels easy with him, which is a nice change. But here's the rub - he's a bottom. While he says he has topped some, he really just has no interest in it, which I totally understand (That and he has a dangerous curve that would make anyone squeal). Fortunately enough, he is being quite the doll about all of this, which is really putting my mind at ease a ton for the time being. However, I'm concerned - It is one thing for him to be cool for the first bit while I wait for my testosterone levels to regain a sense of normalcy (and hopefully fix my ED), but there is no guarantee this will work, and it may be back to the drawing board for me.

So I guess my question here is two-fold. Do any of you bros have an experience with ED? I am trying to just... get an assessment of all of my available options and concerns I should pursue to make sure that I have all of my bases covered. And of course, what should I pursue with him specifically? I am not really interested in opening the relationship, but instead want to make sure I am doing all I can to show him I am attracted to him and care about him. 

It should be noted I have a script for Viagra at the moment, which is great and works some wonders, though it worries me that I may just have to be on that... forever, especially considering my young age, its limited supply, and ridiculous cost. For you bros who haven't been on ED medication before, it is quite the little hassle, as it does sort of take a little bit of planning, and can really take the... random and spontaneous nature of sex out of the equation, which is sort of a damper. 

And of course, to others reading, if any medical advice be provided, do note that reddit is not your doctor and the advice given should not be listed as fact.

Thanks for all the insight. Just want to make sure I'm doing anything and everything in my power to make my body and this relationship work :).

It's hard enough just being trans*, but being interested in men when I don't have the 'right parts' on top of being short just ends up in  crippling insecurity and I've never actually been able to ask a gay community about their opinion on this subject.

So my question for you guys, is would you date a short trans*guy? Or a short guy in general? Though I admittedly wear lifts to make me 5'5"", I'm still completely below average and I can't wear shoes 24/7 either. It seems like all girls want is a tall strapping lad and that's the only feedback I've gotten from society in general. Are short boys as much of a turn off for other guys as it seems to be for women? And would it be too difficult to deal with the fact that I don't have a real dick? (and don't plan on changing that) I like being a little androgynous and I do enjoy girly things, it just all makes me really shy and insecure about my identity and I'd love some feedback of any kind.

Ok, so, I am a fella that is not afraid to admit what he enjoys, etc. When I'm walking in public and see a hot girl, i have the normal ""man the things I would do to her"" type of thoughts. When I see a guy, I can admit if he is good looking/hot but not to the point where I start thinking about having sex with him.

That said, I often fantasize about what it would be like with a guy, even though I'm not attracted enough to any guy to want to fuck them.

That being said, I often fantasize about what it must be like with a guy. I am curious what it must be like to blow a guy &amp; swallow as well as bottom and have him unload inside of me.

So, I suppose my question(s) are, how are those two things? Is it normal to have these thoughts, and if I were ever seriously want to go about it how does one meet a guy thats ok with doing this and nothing more?

I'll go first.

Armpit hair. It seems like a popular one to me. I think it's because women shave their armpit hair, so it's viewed as very masculine to have a forest under your pits. 

Master-slave. It can get old to always be the submissive one and vice-versa. But there's something so sexy about a power discrepancy in sex, agreed? I think it's because being submissive can be really fun because you get to feel the sheer masculinity of the guy you're with.

Let me tell you a bit about myself first.

[Here is a link to the Me Monday I posted this past Monday.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1j9sah/me_monday/cbcpo5k)

Skipping the info from that post, I am a pretty laid-back guy. I work out at least 4 days a week. I'm pretty tech savvy(I can figure my way around most tech devices). I may be kinda quiet at first but I don't take too long to loosen up(No pun intended). I have great friends, all of which know I'm gay and couldn't be any cooler about it. That's where the true intent of this post comes in.


I came out this past March. I have been pretty certain about being gay for a long time but in my mind I didn't really want to be. Before that, I was pretty in denial. I always told myself it was a phase or that I would just need to be with a girl to change my mind. However, I've never really had a very good self image of myself which sort of stopped me from ever pursuing someone. It doesn't help that I'm not very vocal about my sexuality and by looking at me you probably wouldn't be able to tell. All my friends were pretty surprised when I told them I was gay. Being out about my sexuality hasn't changed my personality at all, which why would it, but my point is that although I came out to my friends and family, I don't feel its necessary to tell everyone else I meet, and I feel this will hold me back.

As I'm getting older and seeing as I have never been in any type of relationship, I have been really wanting to meet someone to be in a relationship with, and I feel this is the next logical step in my life, but I just don't know how. I'm completely comfortable with being gay and the thought of meeting a guy and being with a guy couldn't make me happier, but I just don't know how to go about doing that.

I am aware of of those apps such a Grindr, but from what I have heard is that most all of them are pretty much creepy hookup apps and that's not what I want.


So what do you guys think? Am I being too insecure about myself in not wanting to put my sexuality out to new people I meet? Should I maybe be more vocal about it since I am not very noticeably gay as it is?

Sometimes guys (who are usually white as I live in Massachusetts suburbia next to an 1800s replica town) will message me and, before I message them back, I peruse their profiles. I don't message them back if they have ""Yes"" checked off for the question that asks if they would strongly prefer to only date people of their own ethnicity. I just don't know why they're messaging me in the first place. I'm obviously biracial and I don't date guys who are only interested in white men.

I just worry that I'm missing out on some guys, but I am not gonna date someone who only considered me because I'm white enough or something.

Early in the day, everyone was out getting prepared for the party, so the only ones home were me, my mom, my brother-in-law's 12 year old brother (lets call him C), and his mother.

C and I were in my room alone by ourselves. I think we were wrestling or something like that, when he asked to show me a trick. Thinking that he was going to hurt me really bad, I declined. A few minutes later he asked me again, and I said okay. he then pulled down my pants and his dick inside of me. He thrusted me for like 3 or so minutes and then quit it. I don't know if he came, or anything like that. Afterwards, I felt really awkward because even though I was only 7, I knew he made a sexual move on me. I went under my bed for a bit trying to understand what just happened while he stayed in the room and completely dropped the subject and started asking me about lending him some of my games. Not trying to be weird about it, but my ass also felt weird, and I went to the bathroom and wiped myself because it just felt weird back there.

After that, I sometimes felt like he had told other people about it, maybe thinking it was a joke. I remember one time a guy came up to me at this party and asked me if C made me faint, to which I didn't reply. I don't know what that meant. Possibly that C had done it to other people, or that his friends thought it was a joke to behave that way.

A few months after the incident I could recall having my earliest sexual fantasies about men. I became really attracted to some of the male teachers at my middle school, and before I went to sleep I would think about men having sex. I always thought it was because I had that sexual encounter with C.

I hear a lot of people saying that you can't be nurtured into your sexuality, but I feel like I was.

I don't see C too often these days. I can probably count on my hands how many times I see him in a year. I think he is straight, or at least acts that way since he had a girlfriend for some time that he almost married. We have never talked about it once, and he doesn't seem to be into talking about it at all.

I've been an anal virgin by choice. Even though I've had plenty of opportunities to lose it (both topping and bottoming), I've always stopped myself from going all the way. A part of it has to do with being scared of catching an STD, but it has more to do with convincing myself I should save it for the ""right"" guy. I still remember my first kiss with a guy, and my first BJ, and I feel like I'll always remember the first guy I went all the way with, and I just hope the memory will be with someone special to me. 


I'm 24 and just out of college now. I'm just starting to come out to more and more friends but haven't started dating yet. Moreover, this has lead to a lot more opportunities to have sex. Most of my friends are really supportive and encourage me to save it until I find that special guy. However, I feel like I'm losing out on my youth and all the fun I could possibly be having. 


I'm not religious at all and have no problem with how other people express their sexuality. I guess it's more just a personal conviction.

If you were dating someone, and you learned that he was a virgin, how would you feel?

He asked me if I'm chatting with anyone else and I said yeah, I'm playing the field right now. I went over to a friend's place yesterday and he asked if that friend was straight. If I don't reply then he'll keep sending me texts until I do.

I don't know, the guy seems to mean well, but he just seems really insecure and wanting to jump into something serious, which I would rather just let come about from a friendship/someone I'm actually dating.

I was impressed with his stroke technique, as most of the swimmers struggle keeping their head in the water while swimming. I get ready to leave and he was in the hot tub, and left for the locker room right as I got out of the pool. I get to the locker room shower and change, I don't think he showered, but finished changing and was walking out of the locker room in front of me. He stopped at the door and held it for me, had to wait a little while for me to get there though which was kind of awkward. I said thanks and asked him if he swam in high school since his stroke was pretty good and he said he didn't, but had another student help him out with technique last year or something and we chatted while walking out. I ended it with ""I'll see you around.""

I saw him one or two more times and then he came in with a girl, talked with them a bit, she wasn't used to swimming and was spending a little more time on the wall. So while he was doing a lap I was talking to her and asked how they knew each other to see if they were dating. She said they met in DC through a mutual friend, and just so happened to go to the same school. They left at the same time and I still had a good portion of my workout left. 

I had just finished warming up today and he walked in so we talked a bit. This is where it gets interesting. He says something along the lines of ""I'm in a massage therapy program and was wondering if I could practice massaging on you in exchange for some swim lessons to help with stroke technique"" I was kind of shocked when he said this but said that sounded like a fair deal. I used to give swim lessons so I'm familiar with it, and wouldn't mind massages from another guy. He's got good freestyle technique, but could definitely use some help with other strokes. I gave him my name/number when I left and he's supposed to text me whenever he's going to the pool next so I can try and get there the same time. 

So this is where I need some advice, do you think he's gay/bi? 
If I were him and I was straight I would have asked a girl if she'd let me practice on her, seems like a no-brainer, instead of a guy that I've only met a few times and talked to for maybe 15 minutes or so. But I guess you get comfortable with someone pretty quickly when you're both in speedos. I don't like gender stereotypes but being enrolled in a massage therapy program doesn't necessarily scream heterosexual to me. 
Should I tell him that I'm bi (true) in order to eliminate any potential awkwardness if he somehow finds out (even though I'm only out to 6 people) after he's given me massages?
Do I ask him if he's gay/bi?

I grew up suspecting I was gay, yet reassuring myself that, because only 4-10% of the population was, I probably wasn't, and feeling pretty disappointed when I realized that I was. I came out to my family &amp; friends when I was sixteen, and I'm 22 now, still remarkably uncomfortable with my sexuality, maybe even less comfortable with it than I was six years ago. I know there's nothing I can do to change it, and those around me were, and continue to be, very accepting, but I don't think I ever accepted it in my head.

I've hooked up a few times and have even been on dates, kept in close contact with romantic partners, etc, but whenever I'm with a guy, I get the awkward sense that people must think we're just friends or something, or this isn't right, or whatever (almost like a very mild homophobia). Although I share a few characteristics that society would ascribe as ""typical gay male"" like enjoying show tunes and harboring pretty intense emotional feelings for other people (and being fine talking about them), I get very alienated when I'm with a date or whatnot and he's, at all, swishy. I think it's fine to act that way, I really do, but it makes me feel weird about being gay myself. I completely don't identify with that effeminate stereotype. I think this goes beyond accepting myself though, and I think it has more to do with where I see gay people in my community and in the world. I find it hard to see where we fit into the cultural milieu when the societal ""normal"" is so plain to see.

I live in Boston, went to school at an ultra-leftist college in Minnesota, where the reality that I didn't know many other gay men repeatedly bit me in the ass. All my friends were straight. All of them. Very liberal, open-minded people, but straight nonetheless. It made me jealous a lot to see them pair off one-by-one, but I think they wanted to see me happy with someone who really loved me. Now back home in Boston, I'm rediscovering how daunting it is to find someone on a dating site or in a bar or something similar at this age.

But I'm not sure how to feel.,nomoreideas,19,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1fgfiw/a_random_guy_on_reddit_accidentally_convinced_me/,"Get comfy, guys. I will refer to myself as A during the story.

I'm in my 3rd year of university and it's the pointy end of the semester. I had a lot of work this week, culminating in a 5000 word French essay due Friday. I have been incredibly tired all week, due to stress and general lack of sleep - but something really incredible happened on Reddit during the week.

There was [a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1f74dw/post_a_voice_clip_and_guess_the_ops_background/) on r/linguistics the other day in which people were posting recordings of them saying something, and others had to guess their accent. I am an actor, and as an Australian thought I'd give my best standard US accent a go, to see if I could fool anybody. I posted the link, and the next night I went back on Reddit and had a reply. This guy had told me I sounded a bit like a French Canadian, and linked me to a video of [Xavier Dolan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Dolan), a gay québécois film-maker. It was nothing incredibly profound. I closed the laptop. Decided it was bed-time.

Lying in bed, I just couldn't settle. I was welling up with tears and I couldn't quite figure out what was happening. What had occurred to me was that if I ever wanted a shot at happiness - this was it. I had to be honest with myself. I've known for a long time what I am, but fought it so goddamn aggressively, because it wasn't a life that I could see myself in. I always backed honesty in other people, and have repeatedly given advice about self-acceptance, and being who you are and not giving a fuck about the rest of the world. But it was advice that I wasn't entitled to dole out. I wasn't following it, despite believing it with my whole heart.

I didn't sleep a wink. I was too scared that if I fell asleep I would wake up in the morning and forget how resolute and determined I felt about changing my life and being honest with everybody. I fought off sleep until 6am, when I took a deep breath and walked into my parents room. Dad was at the gym, mum was lying there half-asleep. I crawled into bed next to her and before I could even *try* and broach the subject I began to cry. Real deep, hacking, ugly, awful sobs. I'm not an easy crier but I didn't manage to pull myself together throughout the whole ordeal - I weeped as I told mum that I hadn't been honest with myself and others about my sexuality. 

My mum was entirely fine with it - I knew she would be. In fact, my whole life she has said that whoever and whatever I am she will always be proud, and I recognise how lucky I am to have such an outstanding parent. My dad wasn't, and continues not to be, but he did say that he supports me no matter what, although rather begrudingly. He can't really look me in the eyes or speak to me at the moment but I'm not angry with him. I'm sad that he is so upset, but I understand, sympathise and forgive him. He comes from a foreign culture where it is seen as unnatural. He'll come around in the end, I know it.

I sat my sister down to tell her, and she guessed without me really saying. She asked me if that meant we could go shopping together and I punched her in the gut. She took it as a no.

In the same day I told my two best friends. A female friend of mine living in Mexico (Skype was not my preferred platform, but there's not much one can do) and my hetero male friend. The girl reacted wonderfully (and also guessed outright - still trying to figure out if I'm offended or not) and told me that my happiness was just as important as hers, and she was so glad I was becoming my real self. I was scared shitless about my male friend. He's incredibly chill, and has gay friends, but weirdly, moreso than his reaction, I was scared about the actual interaction, and the saying of the words. He was high when I told him, which wasn't amazing. But he also reacted positively and said something which (again!) almost made me cry.

""You will never be my gay friend A, you're always going to be my friend A, who just happens to be gay'.

Right in the feels, that one.

Anyway, I've now come out to all of those close to me. And after having done it, I *do* feel somewhat better. I don't feel incredibly liberated, like I have often read. I still have a lot of people to tell, most of whom I am sure will react in a positive way. But, again, I'm not worried about their reactions - I just am scared of saying the actual words out loud to people.

Something I have realised is that I still feel a bit ashamed. I spent so long hiding, covering up, putting an enormous amount of time and effort into being straight because I was so not okay with who I really was. And now, even though I'm out to my immediate family and best friends, I still don't like to say the words. You might have noticed that I haven't used the word 'gay' yet to describe myself. The reason is, I don't like saying it about myself. I'm trying really hard to discuss it with my mother, but I hate saying things like 'coming out', 'gay', 'homosexual' etc. My mum said to me something that started with 'Well now, A, as a gay man', and I felt so uncomfortable. I know that this is just a part of who I am now, but actually saying it and being it scare me so profoundly. The words feel dirty when I say them.

I guess what I'm asking is - did you guys also feel this? In theory I am happy to be gay, but I still feel that were there a magical pill that 'fixed' me I would probably take it. Not because I hate being gay, but it would just save me a lot of heartache in the short term. A lot of hurt. And I wouldn't have to think about *how* I am going to have kids, or *how* this is going to affect my career-choices, or *how* I am going to tell my grandfather. It still feels a little bit wrong to me, even though I've taken the right steps in trying to be honest and out.

I would appreciate your help/reassurance. Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR:** Redditor on r/linguistics inadvertently convinced me to come out as gay when he mixed up my fake american accent with that of a French Canadian, particularly a gay filmmaker. Came out to close friends and family, but still feel like 'gay' is a bit of a dirty word when talking about myself.

**tl;dr**

**A guy is developing feelings for me faster than I am developing feelings for him. This is the result of a combination of my life experiences and that we have only been able to see each other once. At the end of the post, I've got some options I'm considering.**

I'm in my early 20's and will finish my undergraduate degree in 1-2 years. After that I'm off to grad school - probably in a different state. I'm a double major (in the natural sciences) and regularly take 20+ hours per semester because I think it's fun. I'm the guy that finishes the homework in a couple hours that took everyone else days, then makes himself available to help out anyone who asks. I also make time to party every once in a while.

I *like* caring about people, and it is nice to be part of a support group like that. What usually happens is that people start to consider me a friend quite a bit before I start considering them to be a friend.

When I was growing up I was bullied for being different and the kids I made friends with betrayed me. It got so bad that I had to switch elementary schools. It wasn't until middle school that I made friends I actually kept for a long time. By the time I made it to high school I'd learned how to read people and figure out whether I could trust them, but it still takes a long time for me to become emotionally attached. If I'm not around people I consider friends, the emotions I show are very measured and calculated. I don't make myself emotionally vulnerable.

I have around 7 friends I consider myself close to - the ones I can talk to. I have talked to them about this, but I was wondering if any of y'all had some advice.

I am sexually active. A lot of guys consider me good looking, but I'm not the kind of guy who enjoys my own image. I'm skinny with a little muscle. When I hook up with guys, it's usually bears/cubs in their 30's and 40's. I'm ... well ... into that.

A little over a month ago, I decided to start looking for a long term relationship. Online, I found a very nice guy just a couple years older than me and my type. He is a very good person, and I know he is someone I could fall in love with. The process of me getting to that point is not easy, and could take years. It takes about a year for me to consider someone a close friend (~2-4 months for me to think of them as a friend). He makes me happy - I find myself smiling when talking to him on the phone or texting. We text a lot. Whoever gets up first will usually message the other with a good morning, and whoever goes to bed first will say good night and text *hugs*. Whenever he's having a problem at work or in his life, I try to be there for him as best I can.

He lives about 90 minutes from where I go to school during the year, and 3 hours from where I have a summer internship. Travel isn't really an issue for me since the hours at my internship are very flexible - I get Saturdays and Sundays off, and I can choose one work day per week to get off with very little notice. He lives with his mother currently - but soon won't, and has a stable job. His mother is not okay with his sexuality, and will not let me come over. So he has only been able to make the trip to see me once. We play online games together, and usually Skype so we can talk.

I have some feelings for him (at no point have I tried to keep myself emotionally distant with him as I normally do others), and it has become obvious that he already has more feelings for me than I have for him. He called me a few days ago drunk and wanted to talk to me. He said no one - not even his former boyfriends - had been as nice to him as I had. Just before hanging up, he said he loved me. He woke up the next morning and said he didn't remember what he'd said.

So now I know that he loves me, but I don't love him yet. I'm not sure what I should do.

There are several options I'm considering, but I'm not sure which one (or combination) is best (or if there are others I haven't considered):

1. **Seek professional help.** I'm not sure how normal it is to keep myself emotionally distant from most people, or if it is healthy to interact in this manner. I consider myself emotionally stable, and have healthy outlets for anger (both in friends, games, and writing).

2. **Tell him that he said he loves me.** I don't want him to think I'm not interested - just that it takes me a while to really warm up to people. Should I be up front about what he said and that I do not feel that way yet?

3. **Seriously date other people.** I've never seriously dated anyone before, and I've still only gone on one date with this guy. We are not exclusively dating - I've already confirmed this with him. It is possible someone else might be a better fit for me. Also, while I may be the right guy for many other guys, there might only be a few guys that are right for me in ways not immediately obvious.

4. **Tell him to back off / slow down.** It is possible he will try to move the relationship faster than I'm comfortable with, so I may need to make it clear that I need to move more slowly than other people.",,False,,t5_2vgfw,False,,,True,t3_1f1hpj,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1f1hpj/guy_i_met_is_getting_feelings_for_me_faster_than/,

I never, ever want to be in a relationship with him, but i also still want sex. am i a bad person? or is this the inherant feature of ""friends with benefits?",,True,,t5_2vgfw,False,,,True,t3_1eoew8,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1eoew8/help/,

I want to see what others think, because I have told close to no one, and it's a sensitive topic to me.",The8thFrontier,16,1,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1dgvxx/my_fetishs_rather_mild_but_strange_i_want_to_see/,"Hi there world of reddit, particularly all you gaybro's out there. Quick background, I am male, gay (no hang ups with it either), and 23. I will start by saying **there is a tl;dr version at the bottom** if you wish to skip to that now. I will also say that I am using a new/sock account because on my main one people could figure out who I am quite easily. This is something I am very private/sensitive/shy about. Finally, if I posted this in the wrong subreddit, or you know of one that might be better suited, please tell me. I wanted to post it in /r/gaybros, but I wasn't sure if this would fit there.

I have a... unique fetish. I have met ONE person online over the past 10 years that almost exactly shares my interest in this. It's mild compared to some of the crazy stuff out there. Nevertheless, objectively I can see this is quite bizarre. To put it simply, my biggest fetish (and strongest sexual turn on bar none) surrounds big hands, big feet, and off-kilter body preportions. Further, the idea and concept of each or all of these growing to rather large size. As a little child, I was fascinated with the size of mens feet and hands. It made me very shy, and I dare not speak anything of it, but something about it gave me that little childs butterfly in the stomach feeling when ever I saw someone who possessed them. On one particular occasion that stands out in my mind, I remember the raw beginnings of watching power rangers when I was 4. In it, the power rangers grew to huge size. I stared fixated at the tv, gripped with awe, fear, and excitement. My grandmother noticed this and asked if I was ok as apparently I was dead still. I didn't speak of it. In that moment it made me super protective and shy of this desire.

Later as a teenager and around when I hit puberty, this became a sexual thing for me. I was initially *fascinated* by puberty and how everyone around me was changing and growing. I was enamored by all the boys, in particular the ones who were ahead of the game. It didn't take long for me to figure out that I was gay.

Fastforward to now. I've grown into my sexuality, refined what I like and don't like, and discovered the magical world of the internet and it's limitless supply of every type of fetish material you could think of. I have many spin-off's that have developed from my initial fascinated with abnormally sized hands, feet, and height, but I am going to focus on the first two mostly, since they are the strongest.

I wish I could articulate properly what I find so sexually appealing about big hands and feet, but it simply just *is*. When I am out and about checking out guys, after looking at their face, the first things I look to next is hands and feet, and how big they are, and if they are abnormally large for their height. (time to get descriptive! yay! I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous...) When I look at them, sometimes in my head I imagine their hands and or feet to start growing bigger and bigger. Feet bursting out of their shoes, hands growing to the point where they can't use keyboards anymore. Imagining how they'd react to this, how being touched by hands that large would feel. The strength they'd have, the weight they'd posses. Then seeing how their stride would change. How they'd have to swing size 25 and beyond feet to the side to walk forward. How they'd have to change activites to accomidate for their new apendages. It creates a feeling of longing and out in public I usually don't let myself imagine such things, lest I get hard in public. I have to be attracted to the guys face for any of this to be appealing, but it's a minor detail.

Then I'd imagine it happening to me. Ultimately, I wish I had monsterous hands and feet. It's truly my ultimate wish (although I am omitting other parts of it). I would want to have my hands grow to 2 foot long, bulky, meaty mits. Then have my feet grow out to 30"" by 12"" or bigger. Over the course of months, or years, or maybe a few hours. I want that to be me, more than I want to see it with someone else (although I would love to do it to a boyfriend). Then have to live with it, adjust my life to accommodate for it. How even navigating my home and dealing with daily things would suddenly be a huge challenge. How just feeling that sheer level of size would be like. It's a hugely sexual turn on. I will state that I know this will never happen, and I have done work on myself to not become disillusioned by it all. It's still a desire though. It's still a want.

I already have rather big feet and hands for my height, so I am ""content"" enough, but I'll always want them to be bigger. On a realistic level, big hands are by far the biggest turn on for me in a guy (big feet is a close second). They don't necessary have to be longer than mine (which is a mild challenge to do), but thicker than mine. Just being able to hold hands, touch, and be touched does so much. Big feet is another close second. Ultimately I have found that I like strangely shaped guys. It's been heavily influences by these innate attractions.

Here's a visual aid (for science) for what I am talking about, as it's a  good illustrative example [click here to see](http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/2138/cgdfsgsdf.jpg). I commissioned someone to draw this for me.  it basically personifies most of my fetish interests in one (muscle, very short legs, and long upper body, thick stocky build, long arms, over-masculine face), but the hands in particular are highlighted for obvious reasons. Given the option, if I could become this, I would without a second thought. Instantly! Or if I could do it to a boyfriend of mine, I would.

I have only ever told this stuff to people online, and people who share parallel interests, or are in general sympathetic to ""TF"" (transformation) type fetishes. Why? Cause I am super shy/embaressed about this.

* **TL;DR** I have a sexual fetish attraction to inhumanly large hands and feet, and having them grow to huge size beyond ones control. It's something I am super shy about. Yet, I also hate hiding stuff that has an emotional meaning and I'd like to eventually confess this to a boyfriend (which I might get soon!)*

So yeah... that's my fetish (or the most major one anyway)... what's your reaction/thoughts? I want to see how a general gay audience reacts to this? I am braced for anything, so please be honest and open with your opinions.

Also, I will be happy to answer any and all questions for you. If you made it to the end of reading this, THANK YOU!!

I told him about my depression, that I had started taking antidepressants for the first time in my life, and that my level of job dissatisfaction was causing me to resent how fulfilled he is in his career. I opened up. I put all of my cards on the table and told him how I felt. I had never been that vulnerable in a relationship before. Shortly after this confession, I attempted to be intimate hoping that would make me feel better. I wanted to feel a connection in hopes that I would know he cared and that I was important to him. Instead, he rejected me. Shut me down and left town for the weekend. We broke up as a result.

We had been dating for almost 7 months and I have never been in a relationship that moved as slow as this one. It took a month and a half before we shared our first kiss. Almost two months before we even started toying with the idea of becoming boyfriends. He told me that intercourse was something that was very important to him and it was not something he could rush into. I told him that I was willing to wait because he was worth it, we were worth it.

After seven months, I feel like I gave him everything. I introduced him to my friends, my family, and my running club. I planed trips and adventures, cooked and cleaned for him, watched his cat when he went out of town (which was quite frequently). I did everything I could to share my life with him and after seven months, I feel like he wouldn't open up, he wouldn't let me in, he wouldn't put out, and he wouldn't share his life with me.

I feel like my depression cost me my relationship. I am completely heartbroken and I am still completely in love with him.

The funny thing is, I have this fantasy where I go to his house, knock on his door, he opens it and I grab him. I kiss him deeper and more passionately than I ever have before. I pick him up, carry him into the bedroom and show him how wonderful my love is and how wonderful it can feel.

He is the last thing I think about before sleep and the first thing I think about when I wake.

So what do you think gaybros? What do I do here? Do I fight for someone who doesn't want to fight for me? Do I keep calm and carry on hoping that eventually I'll move on?

I also felt, er, different down there in the morning. I kind of feigned a little more memory loss than I had and texted him asking if we did anything ""new"" that night, and he said no. He also joked around about me forgetting, claiming he remembered it all.

Then last weekend, when we had sex for the first (?) time, I knew once we got started that it was what I remembered happening before. I stopped him and asked him again if we did it that night, and he said no. I said something like ""Are you sure?"" and he seemed kind of hurt and asked me if I thought he would lie to me, to which I said no. At that point I kind of put it out of my mind and enjoyed the rest of the night.

But now I'm starting to get a little concerned. I simultaneously believe him when he says nothing happened, and mostly remember that it did. I honestly don't think he would lie to me and he seemed genuinely hurt when he thought I didn't believe him. I wouldn't exactly be willing to trust my drunk memories if it weren't for the leftover physical sensation in the morning. I just don't know what to do. I'm not sure I'm ready to let it go if there's the possibility that he's lying to me about something like this, but at the same time, he's explicitly denied it twice and if I bring it up again it's sure to cause some trouble. I don't know if it's worth it for something I can't be 100% certain of.

Should I confront him about it for a third time? If so, how should I do it to minimize the issues it could cause for us? I'm just kinda confused right now.

To be clear, I'm not considering this an issue of rape or anything extreme like that. I know myself and I know that if I was drunk, which I was, I would be totally ok with or even initiate sex, even if it was my first time. I'm not concerned about him having taken advantage of me. That's not the issue. It's more an issue of trust that I really want to get straightened out.

I've been out since I was 15 and my family is and has always been incredibly accepting and supportive. 

My youngest brother just turned 11 on monday. We have always had the feeling he might be gay too, he reminds me a lot of myself at his age. Obviously because he's so young we don't know for certain if he is or isn't. My parents have sort of left it to him to figure it out for himself, but made it obvious that they couldn't care less what sexuality any of their kids are as long as they are happy.

Anyways I'm home for two weeks with the bf and he is hanging out with us a lot. A few hours ago he was laughing and telling us about how his friend was shocked I was gay and had asked him if me and the bf actually kissed etc.

He suddenly got very sad and told us that some boys in school say that he's gay. I was taken by surprise and all I could manage to tell him was that they were stupid because there's nothing wrong with being gay and they were all so young that any of them could be gay when they grew up.  

My heart is breaking for him as I know exactly what it felt like at that age. I knew I was probably gay but was desperate to be normal like all kids, trying to tell myself it was just a phase etc. 

I get the feeling that he has an inkling and wants to talk about it with me. You would think I'd know what to say but I was expecting him to be older when and if this came up. I feel like I should have said more to him.

Bros how would you approach this?

But I'm not *proud* of it either. It's just there. What I'm trying to say is that how can you be proud of something you were born with? A trait, like any other? You didn't achieve gayness, or became gay. You were already that way, since the start. *Because* you're gay you were forced to either deal with it and accept that part of you or completely deny it. That's all.

I mean, I don't go praising my white skin or my right handedness. It wouldn't even make sense, right? So why is that different when it comes to sexual behavior? I wanted to ask this because it's seen like such a natural next step when you come out, to be proud of being gay as if it was the healthy and right thing to do.

Now. To those who say they need to show pride in order to make ""society"" believe they're normal and have to be treated as equal. **First**: When you say ""society"", that includes yourself, whether you like it or not. If you want to tell *society* you're equal, start by telling it to a mirror. **Second** : It's not just the gays who fight for their rights. Marriage equality is supported by straight people too. That means they too are in favor of gay rights, but there's no need for gay pride to make a stand.

Shouldn't we be proud of how courageous, persevering, kind or generous we can be to each other, rather than just saying how great it feels to have gay sex? Aren't a person's qualities a more important judge of character than simply their sexual orientation? I love being gay; that just doesn't mean I'm *proud* of it or that it's a huge thing in my life (why should it be?). I learned to be comfortable with my sexuality.

We agreed to be more truthful in our relationship. All's well that ends well...

Until tonight, that is. I was talking on the phone with a friend, and she asked after the bf. She ended up googling him, and she found someone that seemed similar to my boyfriend, but too old for my description. So, she sent me the link, and the pieces started falling together. 

How he said he immediately deleted all dating profiles after our first date ""because he knew he wanted to be with me."" Why he doesn't have a Facebook. How his beloved parents and grandmother were quite so old. I saw a number of little lies and disjointed truths that fit together in the bigger picture. There's no medical condition affecting his skin. He doesn't have low stamina sometimes. His work position isn't so prematurely achieved. It's just that he's 41 when he said he was 34.

Hey Gay Bros; I've been going on dates with this guy (Let's call him Jake), and things are all gung ho on that end. The issue seems to be his room mate (We'll refer to his as Erin). 

Everytime after Jake gets home from our dates/hangouts/whatever, Erin goes mental on him, saying they never get to spend time together and that Jake is trying to replace him with me. Erin is in a 5 year relationship, and lives with his boyfriend. Apparently about a year ago Jake and Erin were interested in each other, but Erin made the choice to fix things up in his relationship instead of persuing Jake. 

Jake's told me a few times now that when he's gotten home, Erin has gone off and started drinking, and starting up arguements with him, because of me. I just feel awkward about the whole situation. The last night we hung out, Erin called Jake and told him he was a huge wreck and he needed him, so Jake had to take off. 

Jake's said multiple times that Erin has no right to feel or act the way he does, because he had his chance, and he made his choice. I'm just kinda at a loss at how to react to it all. The first few times, I told Jake he could invite Erin along, but Erin always just blew the invite off, saying he didn't want to be a third wheel.

TL;DR
Potential BF's Jealous Roommate doesn't like me. History between Potential BF and Roommate; but Roommate chose someone else. Constantly starts arguments with Potential BF about spending time with me. Potential BF has said Roommate has no right to feel or act how he is.

Right now I'm dealing with a very feminine 19 year old co worker, (I'm 28), who is deep in the closet (has a fake girlfriend who he brings into work [you're thinking of Easy A]), who blatantly kept asking me if I wanted to hook up. I kept telling him he was too young, but continued to talk to him and form some sort of friendship. Finally I couldn't take it after a few weeks of him coming on strong, and sent him a text saying that nothing would ever happen. Next day at work he's going around work telling everyone (including my boss) I'm gay, that he thinks I'm disgusting for being gay, and not to look at him (because ""he knows I want him""). 

This has happened to me before.

Right now I'm ignoring it. I'm too old for this shit. I have too much to think about other than some teenagers unhealthy reaction to rejection.

My best friend for almost 5 years is gay. I am a straight girl. He is open, but not necessarily ""out"", if that makes sense? He is closed off to coworkers and some other social groups. He will not outright deny it and make things up, but usually avoids the ""gay talk"". If someone asks him ""are you gay?"" he usually responds with ""haha, what makes you think that?"" Instead of an outright ""no"" lie. I understand completely why he does this, as he is a very manly gay man and works in construction/industry, so being ""out"" usually results in some negative backlash. It would be hard to know he was gay unless you knew him and had a good ""intuition"" for it. This makes it very hard for him to meet people. He is attracted to manly men as well. Most of the time the people he is attracted to are straight. He persues them, maybe gets a few mixed signals, and then heartbreak. I have seen it happen many different times. He often tries to attribute it to him being undesirable or ugly. This is incredibly frustrating because that is not the case, it is just the fact that they dont like penis. I cant tell if his behavior is attention seeking (compliment fishing) or he really feels this way. We go to pride events together, and gay bars. People usually think we are together. I try my damnedest to get him to socialize and talk to people but he is a very shy/reserved person and has the ""well they wont like me anyways"" mentality. He wont go to bars without me. When people do meatgaze him, he makes up excuses as to why he doesn't want to pursue them ""he is too old"" ""his shoes are gross"". And then I get to hear ""no one hits on me ever"" when we get home. He isnt looking for sex, I think he is looking to build a relationship. Part of me thinks a bar isnt a very good place for that, but on the other hand I know alot of gay couples who met in the particular bar we frequent. I tell him he needs to try to be more outgoing and maybe lower his standards a little bit to allow himself to get to know someone....but he tells me that its unfair for him to have to lower his standards. Well, what the fuck. I have lowered my ""standards"" before and have met an incredible man because of it. Social media is out of the question. He is incredibly shy(wont make the first move).

Sorry for the rant...my questions are:
What can I do to help him meet people?
What can I suggest for him to do to help him meet people?
Where do ""manly"" gay men typically go to meet others like them?
Is it unfair to tell him to lower his standards?

I have accepted that I am gay and I've even come out to some of my friends from university. But lately, I have been struggling with my identity and how it relates to my sexuality.

I feel that being gay comes with a type of baggage I can’t yet manage. I feel that society, my peers, the community want to me to stick to one facet of my personality. It feels as if I must decide who I want to be; what kind of gay, per se. I really don't want to give up part of who I am just to subscribe to someone else's ideas of homosexuality, yet I can't help feeling the pressure to do it.  

I enjoy being flamboyant when I feel like being flamboyant. At the same time, I am masculine whenever I feel like being so. Other times I am neither one nor the other. Before coming out, I was just me. It was simpler. But after coming out, I feel as if I am expected to radically change who I am, when there really is nothing to change. I still am the same person! I have the same values and I handle myself in pretty much the same way. Accepting my sexual orientation was tough, but I find that reconciling it with who I was and how it fits, now that I am out in the open (somewhat), is a lot harder.

He then told me that he was on zoloft but he stopped taking it a couple weeks into our relationship, so as to increase his libido, but he felt he needed to start taking it again due to his anxiety and depression setting in again. He told me this so I don't misinterpret his lack of sex drive as him not liking me. I am completely fine with this since I have completely fallen for this guy, and I can get myself off if I need to. But over the past couple weeks he has become much more emotionally distant, from just refusing a little kiss, to bringing me my own blanket when I stay over with him (he is the one asking for me to come over). He apologized to me a few days ago for being a prude (his words), and asked me to come over after work to talk about it, but his friend was there so we couldn't talk and again when it came time to sleep he had another blanket set out for me. This is making me emotionally crazy. I often feel now that he is not interested in me anymore, but then he will randomly do something that throws me off, like kissing me awake, or just hugging me from behind for 10 minutes while telling me how great I am. I don't know what to do, or if it related to his medication. I would hate myself for messing with his well being just so things get better for me because I really care for this guy.

ps thanks to the previous post about anti depressants, it helped me get a better idea about what he is going through, but I don't know what to do on my end.

**UPDATE:** Things are getting much better. We have had a few good talks, and got a lot more out in the open (granted we could both open up much more).  He seems to be doing much better, and seems to be getting a bit of his spark back.  I am feeling much better as well, and I am more okay with the thought of things not working out (it does seem to be working out btw).
We haven't had sex for a few weeks and I am realizing that he is embarrassed about his lack of libido, so I have been giving him some space in that area so as not to make him uncomfortable.  He is still a bit emotionally inconsistent but I can tell he is working on it.

Am I an asshole?,bermuda74,15,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1eo9to/a_story_about_a_relationship_that_i_ended_am_i_an/,"hey guys, so this is a story that happened about a couple of months ago that I'm still pretty ambivalent over, so I decided that sharing it might help me get over it, so here goes!
I met this guy on OKCupid and he was pretty cute. He sent the first message, and we kept going back and forth until we exchanged numbers and facebooks (this was about day 3 of chatting on OKC). After chatting on fb and texting, we started calling each other and talking until the night ended for about 2 or 3 days or so. I felt like I was really connected to him even though we hadn't met yet. Keep in mind that this guy is about 2 hours away from me. So one night I'm texting him while he's at work and he's having a bad day, so I invite him over to talk about it and brighten his day a little bit (technically brighten his night because he came over at about 2 in the morning). We agreed on ""watching a movie"" which snowballed into sexytimes that lasted till about 4 in the morning (we didn't go all the way, but we both came pretty close). After we both erm... finished and started to clean up, all I could think about was how to get this guy out of my apartment... I realized then and there that we didn't have a connection further than the novelty of a first kiss (which made me physically sick later because he smokes, which might have contributed to me wanting him out). The next morning, I told him I had to go to an event with one of my school's organizations, which started at 1PM, but I lied and said it started at 11AM. I made him breakfast (because I'm a fucking gentleman), and we both watched some netflix until 11AM came by and he finally left. During that morning we made out a bit and I didn't feel anything. In fact, I didn't feel anything initially when we first kissed the night before. Right when he left he kept sending me texts about how amazing I am and how his friends have a good feeling about me, and how I'm so different and all I could help but think is ""dude, we just met face to face once and now you're falling for me?"". Every text he sent me after that night was just a chore for me to read that I replied with single word messages. This continued for a few days until he got the hint that I wasn't really interested anymore. I then told him via text messages (I'm not so gentlemanly anymore, I know) that I wasn't into this relationship as much as he was and that I feel like we moved a bit too fast and I guess it made me freak out. I know that at that point I crushed him because I saw his statuses on facebook later that day that hinted at how depressed he was.

It was weird to me, so I ended up blocking him and deleting his number (this was a couple of days ago). He hasn't texted me since this.
Idk bros, I don't really have any regrets about this because I realized just how much I wasn't into him after I met him in person. I want to be happy, and I just wasn't happy with it, so I ended up leading him on. Does this make me an asshole gaybros?

I think I have a fart kink.

I have a thing for humiliation, and smells, so obviously, this is a powerful way to get at both.

I've tried looking for just sexual relationships. Relationships where both me and the other person are aware we're just meeting for kinky sex. This makes me feel bad about myself. I'm a hopeless romantic at heart, and when I realize I've spent so much time chasing dirty sex, I feel sad, to put it bluntly.

That said, it seems laughable to me to think about telling a guy I was in love with ""Hey so... Wanna get really aggressive and do some fairly humiliating things to me?"" It seems like a quick way to turn him off. It's also not a mode I'm ALWAYS in. I don't like to be a submissive sex slut all the time. It's a mood. I don't want to be seen as being defined in this way... when it's just a mood I go through for a week or so from time to time.

I'm posting this cause I don't really know what to do about it. I'm gonna try to make this as short as possible. By the way, this may be relevant, Idk, but I'm 21 yo, 145 lbs, 5'11'' and this is a throwaway account because I'm shy about my (few) problems and needed to vent about this one cause I'm pretty tired of keeping this to myself.

I've been out to most of my friends for at least 4 years now and about a year to my family. I've had my first boyfriend for 5 months (which is now my ex since about 4 months) to whom I've lost my «virginity», by that I mean that I had my first sexual relations with him, but I haven't had anal yet. 

I'm kinda interested in more chubby and hairy guys, I'm more of a twink, less the extra-feminine attitude. Exept, I'm kind of ashamed of this preference I have, further more, I also have some serious sexual problems. I'm really shy and uptight about sex, I do not like to talk about it. Even thought I have sexual urges, like anybody else, I find the actual act of sex pretty animalistic and primitive. I feel bad about having sex with anybody and I fear that I can't find someone who will respect the fact that I don't wanna have sex on the first few dates. I do masturbate to porn, but I'm not comfortable talking about it or letting people know that I do it.

I do wanna find a husband one day and solve those problems, but I don't know how and I'm pretty afraid of going to gay bars where bears hang out in Montreal near where I live (and they are mostly 35-65 yo, so a little to old for me IMO). I've been to an ordinary gay bar (Unity) in Montreal and found that most people there where only looking for sex, which is not what I'm looking for at all. I know some people are gonna tell me to use dating website, but I kinda find it weird for a relationship at 21 yo and I'm afraid people will find my account.

I know I may need a therapist for my problems and that they won't go away in a second, that I will have to work for it and will have to make effort to meet new people, but I really find it scary. 

So anyone with similar problems/solutions or have anything to say that might help me? Sorry about grammar and orthography, I didn't spell check and english is not my native language... 

EDIT:

 Thanks for all your posts :) And I gotta tell you, I'm not that shy about sex... I can talk about sex in general, about my friends having sex (not too explicitly I guess, but it's a start) and I can get pretty vulgar when it's time for a joke, but it really is when it comes to talking about my sexual life and what I prefer and like and how I feel that it gets complicated... So I'm not THAT desperate, I just feel like I should really open more and get more out there and date and try to find someone good for me instead of just being shy and alone in a corner....

I met this guy last year after a production i was in for my school (i'm a dancer) and he came on to me pretty strongly, like without having  to ever really talk to him i knew he was gay. He and I started talking, and eventually i brought up sexuality, and he told me he was straight. We became friends, started seeing each other in school and there was some THICK sexual tension between us, and I knew he wanted to hook up or SOMETHING but was still unsure due to him being so adamant on being straight.

Fast forward a year, i go to his house for a party and we end up fucking, however immediately afterward he basically threw my pants at me and made me go sleep in another room. I was definitely hurt, because i really had started to like him and i knew he felt something for me. We woke up the next day and he said he didn't remember a thing, and didn't say anything to me about it. I decided to move on and just chalk it up to him being a confused closeted guy who just did what he wanted and hooked up with whomever he felt like. a month later we hung out again, and ended up fucking two more times over that weekend, which at the end i was just so confused about and just got uncomfortable with. same story, he ""didn't remember"" those nights, and by this point i was *done*. I decided to stop fucking him, and just drop him a a friend for not being able to talk to me about any of it, but i also was still genuinely confused as to why he felt like he couldn't talk about it. In asking one of his best friends, i found out that he has had a long history of hooking up with guys and then badmouthing the shit out of them when they were finished. He's literally so terrified of being gay, and he hates himself so much for it, and just kinda does what he wants without worrying about the consequences (ie. hooking up with a bunch of guys) and the thing is he and i were actually friends i think, before we started fucking and i just feel so sad for him and just want to be his friend and help him through it all. 

It sucks that i'm caught in the crossfires of his confusion and everything and that i'm directly involved, but i just need to know what i can do or if i should even try and get involved with handling this further, because i really like him and do think he is worth the trouble but at the same time i have to watch out for myself. I know this has been an incredibly long read, but any help/advice you could give me would be much appreciated.

So, I've been with my boyfriend for a few months now, and we're pretty serious. It's all going well. We've been together a few months and we're commuted to our relationship. About a week ago I noticed he still had Scruff and another app, can't remember which. I was extremely displeased. However I had realized that we had never discussed this kind of thing. I pretended to try and open one or two jokingly and he very firmly refused to let me. That made me angry, but again we never discussed it. So I decided to- instead of making an issue of it-to tell him that I wasn't comfortable with him having those apps or using them and that i really didnt like it. He agreed that we had never discussed it but that it was fair of me to tell him, so he deleted them all and the issue was left alone. 

Yesterday night while I was leaving his car I noticed that again he had OKcupid and another app. I was leaving and I didn't want to argue or say anything on my way out. But I'm extremely unhappy. I feel that at the very least he ignored my feelings on the matter-as a matter of fact it really hurts me. And obviously I can't help wondering what he's saying with these men, if he's exchanging cock pics, if he plans on seeing one of them-if he already has, if he doesn't think we'll last and he's simply planning ahead. 
He told me those apps where just there and they didn't mean anything, but if he brought them back on his phone-especially after I told him I didn't like it, then I can't help thinking its not nothing. 
All things considered, my asking him to remove them was reasonable. It wasn't a fight, we had a simple discussion and he agreed. But now they're back, and at best it hurts me that he ignored my feelings and wishes on this matter and I can't help thinking about the worst. I trusted him a minute before I saw that but now....

So I want to know, am I overreacting or being unreasonable?
If I'm not, then how do I address the issue?

I'm still in the closet, and I never had any sexual experiences with other guys before, and for some reason I thought it would be a good idea to hit up craigslist for some fun. (Damn you, hormones)

Yeah, I know. 

I ended up finding a guy a few years older than me; we talked on the phone, traded pictures and chatted. He seemed nice enough and we got along so we eventually both agreed on a meetup date. Before we met up, we both set limits on what each of us were willing or not willing to do. Pretty run of the mill, when it comes to online dating.

But, as soon as we met up, he started pressuring me into doing things we never even talked about. He played the guilt card on me with all the ""I had to drive so far"" and ""I'm doing this as a favor to you"" and other BS like that. He was older than me and stronger too, so I was kind of scared. When I objected to anything he said, he would always get really flustered and assertive. In the end I just got pushed into doing a lot of awkward and weird crap that just made me feel horribly stupid and uncomfortable. 
To make it even worse, this guy just won't stop texting me right now, and I really need him to be out of my life.

Coming out to the authorities against him is not an option, because if my parents ever found out about my sexuality they would for sure kick me out of the house. Not that I can't live by myself or anything, but I can't bear disappointing my family. I worked my ass off these last four years to get accepted into a good University, and I feel like I'd be throwing it all away for nothing.  

I feel like I screwed up my first sexual experience with a guy. I feel like I screwed up my future sex life entirely. I feel like crap. I'm scared of this guy, but more scared to come out against him. I feel like I'm backed into a corner now.

I've never been to /r/askgaybros, but it looks like a better place to have dropped it for advice in the first place. My plans are to leave night shift again, but I'm not really sure what to do after that. There's a gay bar near me I could potentially meet friends at but I've always hated that kind of atmosphere, even with normal bars.

---

I've always shown signs of being different, even as young as around 7 when I was the only boy who played with girls instead of other boys on the playground. None of the other boys knew or called me gay, but I was still picked on for being different and too afraid to defend myself.

My earliest sexual fantasies were of other boys my age when I hit puberty, but I tried to drown the mental images out and was ashamed of having them. Oddly enough I distinctly remember one of those fantasies basically being oral, but I didn't have any knowledge of what a blowjob was at the time which I can recall. Around the age of 13 I heard someone use the word ""porn,"" but I don't remember the context. I went to my computer to Google the meaning of that word, and what happens when you Google ""porn"" happened. Safesearch can't block an outright adult word and still give results. I got into porn young, but would make myself look at straight porn only, still trying to convince myself I'm straight. (After a while, I stumbled on vclart.net, a really old and now unpopular furry site, and on a herm section in particular. Herms were easier to look at without admitting anything. Furry art turned into a fetish which stuck with me, but that's another issue altogether). I could not feel orgasm at all when masturbating. Everything mechanically worked, but I would have no good sensation. Teenage hormones were the only reason I still did it. Around the age of 9, I did feel one before when laying on the floor in a way which grinded my penis between my pelvic bone and the floor, so something ""broke"" between 9 and 13 when I became sexually aware. I know now that it was being caused by my internal turmoil and rapidly degrading mental issues, and it didn't affect me when I accidentally did it at 9 because I didn't understand why it felt good and didn't associate it with sex.

In freshman year of high school, I used to hang out with a group of gays, but I wasn't always nice to them. One even saw through me somehow and knew I was gay, but when he opened up to having a crush on me, I immediately lied that I was straight, flipped out at him, and broke his heart. From the burning internal conflict I was ignoring, one day I would be friendly, and the next I would throw names at them, openly calling them ""faggot,"" and not caring who sees me pick on them. Looking back, I think I did this out of envy. I'm surprised they always forgave me afterwards when I would go back to being friendly. Maybe they were either so used to it they ignored it, or didn't actually forgive me but didn't want to show it. High school is when my mental state started to noticeably fall apart. I was on Prozac for a while, was extremely easy to make angry to the point of being dangerous, and even ended up having my first of several panic attacks while in school. Lying to yourself like this is dangerous. Since I didn't ever speak of this with anyone, even the therapist, naturally there was no human way for them to know the real cause.

I've been in two failed relationships, both with girls. My first one was long distance and since we were obviously not sexually active and the fact that we were hiding behind text, it was much easier to feed into my self-lies. My second one was with a tomboyish girl. My denial was so strong, I still denied being gay after having sex with her and being incredibly grossed out by it. We did this a couple times, and I silently dreaded it every time.

It got increasingly difficult to lie to myself now that I had a relationship with a girl which wasn't long distance. I distinctly remember the night when I stopped. It was 4 or 5 in the morning and I still couldn't sleep from my mind being so active. I was distraught to the point of being suicidal, but each method of doing it which I was thinking of horrified me. I started to silently cry with the second girlfriend asleep next to me. I don't know how she woke up, but she heard the way I was breathing apparently and knew I was crying, cuddling close to me so I was little spoon. She didn't know I was thinking of suicide, but she managed to calm me down and her doing that made me think of everyone who relies on me and cares for me. I'm not sure if I would have gone through with it, but I credit her with saving my life.

At this point, I’ve broken two girls' hearts because I couldn't accept the truth. I’ve gotten in touch with both so I could apologize for leading them on for so long. I'm still friends with both. At 20 years old, with my social bridges to every gay guy in the area burned and everyone still thinking I'm straight, I naturally have never had a boyfriend. I've had a bi-curious male ""friend with benefits"" and two guys I had one night stands with, but no actual relationships. I'm 22 now and I've both given up and created a self-fulfilling prophecy by switching to night shift and stopping my searching for a nice guy, focusing completely on work.

I think part of the reason I wanted to be straight is because of my dad but I'm not sure. I've also still not confronted him about it and he still thinks I'm dating the second girlfriend. Part of me still hates the idea of being gay. I switch back and forth daily between feeling okay and hating myself. I can't even explain why I feel this way. I'm not religious, and there's really no reason to. A few months ago when I was on my last date with a guy, I couldn't even get myself to hold his hand in public, ashamed of myself. My anger issues, panic attacks, and inability to orgasm were gone almost as soon as I accepted the truth, but something is still eating me.",,False,,t5_2vgfw,1361994599.0,,,True,t3_19ccwh,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/19ccwh/im_a_lonely_selfhating_gay_man_and_its_completely/,

So my husbro and I have been having some issues with the bedroom.  He just doesn't have quite as active as a sex drive as he used to.

About 6 months into the relationship, we start having fights and the romance isn't really there anymore, but I had fallen madly in love with him, so I tried my best to mend the relationship.

This is where I went wrong. We had some pretty bad fights, where I would end up bleeding from him slapping/punching me in the face and pushing me. I felt so ashamed that my own boyfriend would do this to me, but for some reason I would always forgive him. He started cheating on me, and that's where I would get fed up and try to leave. I decided to also ""cheat"" and then our relationship became an unstable one where we would get back together, cheat on each other, have fights where he would break my stuff or hit me, and I am always too scared to hit him back.

The worst part is that we signed a lease together for a year, so I have no idea how to get out of this situation. I try to leave as much as I can, but when I come back home, he tries to cook me dinner and makes me watch tv and eat with him. This is where my feelings for him rush back. I don't know what's wrong with me. I know in my head that I need to get the fuck away from him, but being in a situation where I live with the guy, I don't know what to do.

Well last week, we ""broke up"" and I told him that I didn't want to be with him anymore because he had been acting more strangely than usual, and I just got fed up with how selfish and self-centered he is. He only thinks about himself and his needs, so I just told him we shouldn't be together.

Last night is the reason why I'm writing this. He saw me kiss a guy at a gay bar, and immediately flipped out. He was at the gay bars picking up guys, too, so I didn't understand why he got so mad. Well he goes home and breaks my laptop and my phone, completely DEMOLISHED, and he left all the pieces in a paper bag for me to see. He continues to threaten me and I just ask him to leave me alone. Unfortunately we sleep in the same room with 2 beds, so I decided to go sleep on the couch. He wouldn't go to sleep though. He just kept standing in the living room, and I got really scared and had no idea what to do. My phone was broken, my laptop was broken, and I just felt like crap. The only thing I had left was my ipad, which he got furious at when he saw that he forgot to destroy that too. I began recording our conversation without knowing to get evidence that he broke all my stuff, which I did. However, he figures out what I'm doing rather quickly. He knows all my passwords, as I do his, and he erases everything on my ipad remotely so that I couldn't retrieve the recorded file. At this point, I was afraid for my life, but I carry a pocket knife with me so I was ready if he tried to attack me. Apparently I fell asleep on the couch and wake up before him. I take his backpack, take his phone, insert my SIM card from my broken phone into his and now I have his laptop and his phone and using them as my own. And I get the hell out of there after I quickly packed my stuff. Now I'm somewhere safe, and this is where I need someone's help.

I just want my old life back. I was such a happy, optimistic person before I met him. I have no idea what to do now. Other than screwing him over by taking all his school stuff, his laptop, and his phone, I don't want to get revenge. I just want a life free of him. Please someone help me.

For the longest time I believed it was just bad timing and things would get back to normal eventually but I am now coming to terms with the fact that he really is just not interested in sex. 
It has had a negative effect on my feelings towards him. He will tell me how much he loves me and I think “Fuck love! I just want you to lust after me!” I would bring up the issue to him and he would either get angry and we would fight or he would be apologetic/self-deprecating and would give excuses as to why he wasn't in the mood very often (some valid excuses, stress of grad school and deadlines, some rather lame, eating too much dairy and being ""the worst boyfriend ever"").

It wasn’t as eloquent as I had planned for, but it’s done and I can at least get that weight off my back. Their initial reactions were encouraging; my mom, dad, brother and sister all said they didn’t care and they love me and support me. I went to bed feeling pretty good and was glad I told them. The next day, though, things weren’t as easy, and I need some advice from you guys on how to handle this. 

My mom and I talked about it a bit in person the next day before I came back to Austin, we talked for about an hour on the phone when I got back, and had a pretty rough conversation this morning, about an hour ago. My dad, who was clearly shocked and didn’t talk to me about it before I left, sent me an email early in the week saying he was busy all week but that he owed me a phone call. We talked yesterday and the conversation left me feeling pretty shitty. Brother and sister haven’t said anything to me directly about the issue but both texted me this week about random shit.

I realize that this will take them a lot of time to come to terms with. It took me most of my life to this point to accept it. But at the same time, their entire focus seems to be on not accepting that it’s true and I don’t think they will make any progress as long as they won’t understand that this is something I have accepted as who I am, something I can’t change, and something I am ok with.  My mom told me that both my brother and sister told her they won’t tell their friends, and my sister asked my mom to ask me not to tell anyone. 

This is a list of some of the things they have said that I really need your advice on how to respond to. I thought most of my responses to them were good but my mom has told me I don't seem to be trying to answer their questions, so I am obviously not addressing it well enough.

* HOW DO YOU KNOW? I really don’t know how to put words to this one.
* Do you think you can change?
* People will tell you to your face that they are ok with it, but they won’t really be.  Everyone will look at you differently, you will be ridiculed, ostracized. 
* You won’t be as successful in your career. (Point to Tim Cook, Lord Browne, vice-chair of Ernst and Young (my dad's partner at another Big4, so that may help) but do you guys know of any more? That's the best I could find on Google)
* Why is it important to you to tell people? 
* Why is your sexuality anyone’s business? I don’t go around telling people I’m heterosexual. (To which I have LOTS of examples of how, yes, they very much do…)
* Why haven’t you tried to at least have a relationship with a girl?
* How can you be sure if you haven’t had a relationship with a guy?
* You just expect us to blindly accept that this is true. You won’t even try to accept that maybe it’s not.
* Is this just something that you are deciding because you are unhappy? Because you haven’t found the right girl yet?
* You say that it’s important to you to share this because it will make you happy. So you’re saying that your whole life until now you have been unhappy?

I have found some good literature published by counselors that specialize in this that I plan to send them, and I plan to link them to PFLAG as suggested to /u/jayobear. 
They keep telling me I need to talk to people in real life, in person, because talking to people online doesn’t count. My mom says people online aren’t “real people,” which I can’t even begin to explain….  

Anyways, Gaybros, this is long and I know it’s a lot to ask. I really appreciate any advice you have.

I have a bit of a quandary. 

I have seen the young cousin of a friend of mine on grindr. I know him and we have had several conversations. He's a good guy but a little mixed up. 

But I know he isn't out to his family. 

I know that he has seen me on grindr and his account disappeared. I just know he freaked out. 

I though of contacting him (we're friends on facebook) to say, ""I seen your profile, I'm cool with it (of course), but I will not say a thing to anyone"" but then I though that it wasn't my place and did nothing. 

That was a couple of months ago. 

I then today saw his profile back again, this time his face was covered but I recognised his tattoo (it's in Italian with a weird grammatical error) and I'm thinking of sending him a Facebook or grindr message. 

My intention is that he can put his mind to rest, explore his sexuality, without fear that he'd be outed by me. But I don't want to make things difficult for him. 

What do you think?

Ive been dating this bro for a year now. Everything is amazing except the most important thing in a relationship, he doesnt trust me.

We are both in our mid twenties, live separately and have good jobs, he actually makes a lot more money than I do. According to others, I'm a decent looking guy(I model on a side), and constantly get hit on by both genders. The bro is not that fortunate, he might be a 5 or 6 in everyone else's book but he's perfect to me... hes my exact type and he turns me on like crazy. Hes very confident in himself, just doesnt like the way he looks and wants to improve his skinny body. He doesnt have self esteem issues, but the fact that Im better looking, makes him question everyone I hang out with.

A a month ago, we stopped using condoms, which took a long time to convince him and multiple checkups. Well that lasted until few days ago....says he cant trust me and just wants to be safe, which I totally understand but the ""cant trust"" part enrages me. He always been dropping these little hints about me sleeping around since we started dating and lately hes been very passive aggressive about it even though we confirmed several times that we are exclusive. 

I do care a lot for him and I go out of my way to make him happy, more than he does for me. I'm very family oriented person. I never had a random hookup in my life and I dont really give him any reasons to think that I'm cheating...well, except my gay friends, he dislikes every single one of them. He hates the scene, he doesnt go out with me. A lot of times we just go out with our own friends. But I'm constantly meeting new people and making new friends, adding them on fb or getting phone numbers, because living in a big city is all about networking. A lot of them expressed interest but I politely decline and I can tell that it annoys the shit out of him. He has access to my phone when Im around but doesnt go through it, I have nothing to hide and I tell him everything.

Im not really looking for a solution here, just wanted to vent. I know what I have to do eventually, it just sucks because this relationship is not progressing anywhere for some time now, and it makes me really sad...

Sorry for the long post. 

So, this past weekend I did a hiking/camping trip with a guy I've been getting to know. We meet off grindr about 6 weeks ago and have been hanging out a bit in our city and done a few hiking trips. We have a lot in common except for a few things- I'm older (I’m 38, he’s 24), more set financially, have a career, and have been out longer, more dating experience. He just came out in December and is still finding his way. I’ve found myself attracted to him and we’ve hooked up 5 or so times, done a couple sleepovers. We’ve had great chemistry, fun sex. 

This past week I asked if he wanted to do another trip to the mountains and he said he’d love to. Shortly thereafter he replied and told me he’s been chatting with a guy from OKCupid and is excited about him, see where it might go, etc., and that it was refreshing to meet me, and he and I will be great camping buddies. I told him I was a bit conflicted about things too (could it even work?), but that I really enjoy his company and feel some good chemistry. I was disappointed.

Anyway, so over this past weekend we hiked all day Saturday till we found an amazing campsite under a mountain, next to a lake. I brought some whisky and we started drinking a bit before dinner and he surprised me with wine. I don’t ordinarily drink that much, but thought what the hell. Had a good time chatting and hanging out till bed. This is where things get hazy…. I’m not the best sleeper especially in tents and brought an Ambien to knock me down. I’ve taken it with a few drinks before (I know that’s bad), but maybe never when I’m drunk. I needed sleep and he passes out immediately. I recall looking at him thinking “I want sex”, but he wanted to sleep. 

At some point the alcohol/Ambien combo took over my brain and I don’t remember anything until I woke up. In the morning, I asked he how he slept and if I said anything embarrassing in my sleep (I sometimes talk). He said “no, but you tried to give me a blowjob”. I don’t have any recollection at all. Evidently, sometime in the night I woke him up, started kissing him, ripped down his briefs, and sucked his dick. I said all sorts of dirty things about trying to get him to cum, etc. I even climbed on top of him and said I was gonna fuck his ass. He said for a few minutes my cock was actually inside him. He said he kissed me for a bit, but would try to rollover and show he wanted to sleep. He didn’t say if he ever said “no” or anything explicit, but it’s clear (now) he wasn’t game. Neither of us ended up cumming and I’m sure I just rolled over and passed out at some point. 

The next day he teased me a bit and seems to have a good sense of humor about it (Brokeback/Bareback Mountain jokes, etc.), but I’m extremely embarrassed and ashamed with my actions. It feels like I crossed a line and jeopardized our friendship and whatever miniscule romantic potential we had. I’m not sure what to do now. I told him I never would’ve done that to a random tent mate, but we’ve had sex before and it was pretty good. 

How would you guys handle this? I’ve apologized, but I can’t get it out of my mind. I’m tempted to go quiet for a while and just wait to see if he contacts me, makes plans with me, wants to see me. I know part of this is I’m disappointed he doesn’t want to date, but I also will be happy to have him as a friend especially since so few gay dudes like this outdoors stuff. I keep ruminating on this and feeling bad. Shame spiral big time. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

I am out about 5 years now. I can honestly say I still have no idea what I am doing when it comes to dating. While I was in college I had a boyfriend (my first boyfriend, probably my only) for about 6 weeks and it felt no different from the single life.

I guess what I am looking for is more a companion; someone who wants to go with me on trips to new places and try new restaurants or even stay in and marathon a series of movies or a tv show; someone to cuddle with when I need to be held and someone who wants to seek comfort from me when they are have a bad go of it. 

But here is my problem. I have zero confidence when I am at a large social scene. I am a very shy introvert. I have a tendency to just lock up in large unfamiliar groups. When I am at a gay bar or a club, I try and get a scope for the room, look around see who is there, try to get someone's eye contact. Whenever I do this, it seems quite eerily like everyone is actively avoiding my eye contact. (Is that normal, or is that just me?)

I feel as though I am physically attractive. I am tall.

I do feel good being alone most of the time (I am an honest for goodness introvert) but, after so many years, the loneliness is really starting to be burdensome.

I was almost proud of myself for stepping out of my comfort zone back then and really trying something new out. But now it's like, I get a whiff of his BO or see my pants on the floor and it makes my stomach upset. 

Maybe it's because this time was at my place so I can't escape it? Or that I knew him before as just friends? Or I'm worried it will be awkward when we see each other again? 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get over this feeling? I hate feeling like this, uncomfortable, queasy, guilty, like I can't believe I just did that. 

**Update:** So today I spoke with him about the situation and I feel a lot better because I know his point of view now, too. I mentioned how I just want to stay friends and how I'm not looking for a relationship or anything because I'm about 80% sure I'm going to be moving to a new city in a few months to accept a job offer. He was cool and understanding, but then he apologized for being so forward and if it seemed like he was taking advantage of how drunk I was. He said he was drunk and things just happened.

I decided to set a deadline of when I on holiday, to tell all my closest friends

On Monday, I came out to a friend. I'd invited him around to my house, and afterwards, when we we sitting at the bus stop I told him. ( I actually said it in my head, then heard my mouth say it a few seconds later, very surreal). He was completely accepting (He told me he was bi, so apparently I made a good choice of who to come out to first), but had absolutely no idea beforehand. I was expecting to feel relieved or something afterwards, but I just felt empty, knowing that I still had to tell all my other friends.

Today I met up with some other friends, and had been planning to tell them. But I just couldn't get the words out of my mouth. I now feel absolutely terrible, lightheaded and dizzy.

You guys probably get posts like these all the time, but I just needed to talk to someone. Sorry that it's not really a question

Update: The whole of Thursday at school, and at prom, I couldn't do it. I just couldn't summon up the courage. So today, I was spending the day at a friends house, with four of my closest friends. I took a piece of paper with the words ""I'm Gay"" written on them, in case I couldn't get the words out. I ended up folding it into an origami swan, because that's something I do when I'm nervous.  I struggled to do it the whole day, but about 30 minutes before I was to leave, we went out to muck about in the garden. After a few minutes, I handed the swan to a friend, and told him to unfold it. He said, it says ""I'm gay"" but they all just laughed it off. A lay in silence for a minute, then said, 'I wasn't joking'. One of my friends then came up to me and said, 'If you were going to come out, you would have done it in a better way than an origami swan'. He then gave me a look and said' You confuse me', when I didn't say anything (I just couldn't think of what to say). We then continued to muck about with some footballs for a few minutes, and then we all went home. I'm pretty sure they didn't believe me. :(

I started dating this guy about a month ago. Over the course of this month, we've had a really great time. We've spent every possible hour that we can with each other over the past two weeks, which isn't much due to schedules. Nonetheless, it's clear we really like each other. We've made major efforts (and late LATE night trips) to spend what little time we can while his schedule is hectic.

With the last guy I dated, I was an anxious mess by this point. Constantly worrying, constantly nervous, basically always on edge and over sensitive. For whatever reason, that didn't happen with this guy and I had hoped that maybe last time it was because it was my first real relationship, and now that I've done that I'm more relaxed.

Nope. It all hit me full force yesterday. Suddenly I was over analyzing every text he sent, every word he spoke, every iota of body language. It got so bad that it made sex subpar last night, as opposed to fucking fantastic which it has always been. I never vocalize any of it, I internalize it all and silently scream all night as my inner anxiety monster chips away at my practiced smile. It's the same thing all ever again. Just like the early days of my last relationship, he asks me ""What's wrong,""  and I smile and say ""Nothing!"" And we go back to cuddling. Meanwhile, my brain is working overtime.

I know I should probably say something but I just don't want to. I really like this guy and I don't want to dump all the crazy on him so soon and scare him off. I want to be sure I've hooked him before I reveal the crazy, so the crazy seems silly, or just part of the package.

Oh, also doesn't help that I'm a recovered anorexic, body dysmorphic 25 year old, and he's a 22 year old Greek god with a lithe, statuesque body, a six pack, and is incredibly attractive. Confidence oozes from him, in that ""I used to give many shits, but it was detrimental to my health, so now I give none"" kind of way. 

I just want to be able to enjoy this, with the occasional pang of anxiety, like sane people do. This was going so well, and now I'm scared that my brain is going to fuck it up, which makes the anxiety worse. It's like not being able to fall asleep and being angry at yourself for not being able to fall asleep, which keeps you up longer.

What in fuck's name can I do here? I want to just date this guy without wondering whether or not he actually likes me or not. I want to be able to cuddle naked without worrying that he thinks I'm unattractive. I'm tired of being sick like this. It's driving me insane. Help, please.

I am 100% a gaymer though. Are there any masculine men who like men who are not super macho but not flaming. Some guys mentioned they like more feminine men here, but I'm more in-between.  
  
I also like men who mostly top (although top/vers is more preferred because sex isn't fun if you can't switch it up every once in a while). I feel weird thinking that I like being the one in a relationship who will cook, clean, bake, etc. because I like doing those things. I also want to pamper my first boyfriend and later future husband(s). I also can't wait to have kids. Am I weird for wanting a heteronormative relationship where one guy is more masculine? It just feels like that would work out well for me. However, I'm not closed-minded and I am open to men who don't fit what I want because that would be stupid and would close off the potential for something great.

I do not really have any gay friends and so when I get advice its coming from straight guys and straight girls.  

I met this guy-Sam-a couple of weeks ago and we got along great. The first night we hung out, he made a move on me and thats where it started. We hooked up, but did not have sex as I wont have sex with someone I do not know (I'm not in college anymore and I'm over that). I told him this and he was like ""I don't want to do anything youre not comfortable with-we can do it whenever."" Awesome. 

So the next day he was going on a business trip for the rest of the week. We proceeded to text all throughout the week-nothing overtly sexual just normal texting. When he flew back from his trip the next Friday, he asked me to come over and hang out, which I did. We had a great time, went out for a little bit, came back to his house and hooked up. The next morning he made me brunch. We hung out all day. He had friends visiting that night, so I said I had dinner plans.  Later he texted me to meet up and we all hung out. We went back to his place and we crashed in the same bed together even after this girl was trying to get him to sleep with her (she tried hard enough where she walked into the room we were in and tried to convince him that the other bed-which was his own bed-was more comfortable...wtf?). I'm glad he stayed in the room with me bc I would not have been happy regardless if we werent hooking up and just sleeping.

The next day he invited me to a baseball game with one of his best friends. Then he went on a business trip again and we facetimed one night for like an hour while planning a getaway for this past weekend.  

Ok, so this weekend. We drive north and get a hotel-his idea-go out to dinner. Middle of dinner and several drinks in we start talking about our exes, if we've been in love, whatever. I don't have any clue how we started talking about that shit, but I didnt like because I get crazy jealous.  I know we're only 2 weeks in, but I never like anyone. Honestly, never.  I just started being open about dating guys, but he is the first one I've wanted to really pursue something with...I know hes playing games with me though bc thats just the way he is.  Its keeping me interested but also making me crazy a little.  With that being said, I had to excuse myself from the table and lock it up, because I was going to flip out---which is a bad idea. Everything is fine, we go back to the hotel, hook up and then I basically make him say he likes me (which I think is kind of crazy, but whatever). We have sex the next morning-yesterday-and he's been with his family all weekend and all I can do is think about him. We've only exchanged a few texts since I last saw him and I really feel like hes testing me....How do I handle this situation? Are things going well and I'm just psyching myself out? I just feel like I never find someone that I'm interested in! I literally havent had sex in over 2 years. He knew all this btw. In fact, the first night we hung out I mentioned I can only have sex with someone I like. So...unless hes a sociopath and/or running some long game on me...I don't understand whats going on, despite the fact that the signs seem to be indicating he's into me. This is my first reddit post btw, so I'm sorry if it's kind of shitty. I'll get better. I'm just curious how the beginning of dating goes for people...do you play games to test the other person? try to make them jealous? want to be with them all the time? I hate it and love it at the same time.

Update: After not texting me all day, which clearly made me nuts, he just texted me and asked me to see a movie with him tomorrow. Thank God man bc I clearly could not stop thinking about this all day.

I wanted to get some advice/thoughts from you guys about a small problem I'm having with my current boyfriend. We both got tested three months into our monogamous relationship (and both been relatively safe with prior partners), so we bareback.

When I top him, his rectum is pretty tight and I'm quite thick. This causes a bit of an issue; I'm uncut, so his rectum pretty much grasps my foreskin and my head doesn't get much stimulation. Basically, his ass is grabbing onto the foreskin and penetration feels like my foreskin going back and forth with the head not getting much feeling from the moment.

I'm not sure if other guys have had this problem - or if this makes sense. But for those who might have a similar issue, what was your fix?

I am sort of coming to terms with being a possible gaybro. As most of you would know, it's a pretty stressful time in ones life, and it is something that is taking a large part of my mind away from what is relevant (work/living/driving etc). 

What I want to know is - Should I try before I buy? 

In other words should I give dating bros a chance or should I tell everyone first? I am somewhat of a manly man (or like to think I am). I am not completely sure, but I really want to know before I go by the stereotype. The stereotype where I come from is still of the feminine type (nothing wrong with that, but I don't want that stigma on me for the rest of my life especially when I do not at all feel associated). 

Basically, my Dad is the first person I would want to tell, followed by my Mum and sister, but I haven't ever worked up the courage. Dad would be the hardest obviously.

Coming from Aus, my parents say they don't care and are very open - But my main thing with this is also children. I have always wanted kids, and to me I would be devastated to never have the opportunity to never be a father and give my parents grandkids. Is there a chance I could have kids?

So... any advise to what I have posted above? I haven't really asked anything, and I want to sort of vent which feels amazing. But, I have never mentioned the ""three words"" to even myself which I know will change my life forever. It will never define me, but it will be a major part of my life.

Also, I live in an area it is not really acceptable ATM. At the end of June I am moving back to the East Coast where it is more acceptable... so was thinking of leaving it until then.

One of my best friends died about six months ago and it has been a really hard half a year.  The first year we met and became friends we spent a summer in Hawaii.  That was 10 years ago now and I am heading back to Hawaii this week for an unrelated reason.  Hawaii still holds a very special place in our friendship, it was also where I first fell in love with my friend and realized I wasn't straight and could have feelings for a another man.  This eventually turned into a cliche'd I am in love with my best friend, but we eventually got through that and remained incredibly close until his death.


  Here is where I need help.  Because Hawaii is so meaningful one of the reasons I went on this trip is so I could take some time to memorialize my friend and our friendship in the place it really formed, and I am hoping this brings some closure on the emotional rollercoaster I have been on since his death.  The problem is I don't know what to do.  My only plan thus far is to buy a bottle of nice scotch and head as close to the beach as I can get to drink it.  I don't know if I should leave something personal behind so a part of him stays in paradise?  Write down my thoughts and memories and send a bottle into the ocean?  Anything?  Is there anyone who used a symbolic ceremony or event to help get over the loss of a loved one?

TL:DR- Friend died and want to memorialize him at the beach, need ideas.

First I should say that I've been a lurker for a while and I really appreciate the community present here. Please excuse the throwaway as my girlfriend knows my normal reddit username.

I suppose that should raise a few red flags, no? Girlfriend. So yeah, that seems to be my problem at the moment. Several months back I started dating a rather close friend of mine (and a very close friend of many of my friends), and since then we've had a great time together, enjoying each other's company, sharing (many but clearly not all) secrets, and even spending some time together under the covers. I'm in my early twenties. This isn't my first relationship and I've been down this path before. I'm generally not an overly expressive or emotive person, but the small swings in my emotions seem to have a greater impact on me because they're somewhat unexpected and very noticeable to me. Almost every time I have entered a relationship, I have begun to doubt what I am doing with the woman and wondering whether I'm lying to myself and others about my sexuality. The relationship will last a few months, and in one case a year, before I break it off. In the past, especially way back when in high school, I passed it off as boredom. I just wanted to move on from a relationship that wasn't going anywhere, right? Well, the relationship I'm in now comes after a much longer break between girlfriends, and it'd given me a long time to consider who I am and what I'm attracted to. I'm not sure if this extra time has actually made a difference, though, or whether the build up to the initialization of the relationship just makes me feel differently about where I am right now. I've always had a very deep emotional connection to women, and towards the beginning of high school I also began to determine whether I was sexually attracted to men. Without getting to detailed, it's important to know that I am aroused by the sights of both the male and female figure. I've also increasingly grown fonder of the idea of being with a man, emotionally and physically, but haven't had the opportunity (let's face it: courage) to see if it was really for me. Regardless, I'm sure I'm attracted to men - I check them out all the time. I suppose the reason I'm here at [1] /r/askgaybros here tonight is to see if anyone has had similar experiences with their evolving sexuality. How did they remove themselves from the hole they had slowly dug themselves and ""come out."" I've told a small handful of my friends that I might be bisexual. I live in a city and community that would be very supportive of whatever sexuality I choose. And I'm almost certain that my parents just really couldn't give a bigger shit who I choose to bone. Nevertheless, I feel like the biggest fucker because I've ""led on"" my girlfriend for the past several months and shared countless intimate moments with her.

tl;dr: I need to get out and explore my sexuality, but how the fuck do I tell my girlfriend without risking my friendship with her or others?

And he responded 'Certainly, maybe I can come to your place next time?'

And that was that. Later that evening he texted me saying he had a really good time, and wanted to see me again. He just wasn't sure when. That made me glad, because I initially really liked this guy - and still do.

Tell you they're interested, but then when further interaction comes up - they ignore the living crap out of you? If I don't feel like it clicked - I tend to tell the person politely.

So it finally happened; I found a guy. Met him through growlr, had four dates so far, everything's going great. except, not quite. you see, I'm a virgin (er, was very recently a virgin? More on that later). I failed to explain this to him on our third date, which ended how most third dates do. Except for most people, third date sex probably comes naturally and easy. I, however, found myself with my pants around my ankles, confused as all hell, and so anxious that I lost any sign of an erection in all of thirty seconds. In short, had bad sex. I tried to fuck him, but my dick was a limp noodle. about the only thing I did right was making out with him and blowing him, both of which I seem to be pretty good at. add to that that my dick hasn't changed size since I was 9 years old, and the condom was so large you could fit a fucking human being in with my dick, and you can see how humiliated I might be. 

I messaged him on Facebook later apologizing for the bad sex. I told him I felt like shit. he assured me that it was fine, and he had fun. I tried to get over myself, but was depressed as fuck the whole night. BUT, he's still texting me. that's good. I didn't completely turn him off. fast forward a couple of days and we're on our fourth date. we're starting to get to know each other better. conversation is easier. cuddling feels more natural. later on, we start making out. its better this time. more intimate, more enjoyable. but then I remember, ""oh shit, we have to fuck now."" same problem with the condoms. I mention my size to him this time, apologize for not being larger. he says its fine, as long as you know what to do with it. except I don't know what to fucking do with it. 

this time, I actually get in! feels great, except for the fact that it feels like I'm covering my dick with a damn grocery bag. but all of a sudden, Mr boner decides to leave us, and I'm left with a limp dick again. keep in mind, he doesn't know I've never been in anyone, and vice versa, and I advertised myself as a vers top. so, naturally, he asks me if I'm ready to get fucked. so I give in and tell him the truth. the half truth at least. I tell him I've never had anyone inside me. at first he's a little surprised. he's assumed all this time that I was vers, and while I've always been open to the possibility of getting fucked, it hadn't happened up until that night. keep in mind, he's 18 and I'm 21. I'm the third guy he's been with, he's my first. also keep in mind that he has a huge dick compared to mine. I won't go into too much detail, but suffice to say he only got halfway in me. and the night ended same as before. he came from jacking off. I didn't even bother. I almost feel like I didn't deserve to come for being so bad at this sex thing. I just feel like I don't live up to what he expected me to be. so with all that in mind, I (finally) come to these three questions: (1) why does my dick keep getting limp during sex? when we make out or cuddle I'm as hard as a rock, but when we get down to business its gone. (2) should I tell him I am/was a virgin? I feel like maybe it would clear the air and explain to him why the sex has been so terrible on my part. and (3) just...how do you fucking not feel inadequate? this guy is amazing! he's hot(ter than me), he's smart(er than me), and I just feel like I don't deserve him and like I'm holding him back from being with a guy that matches his quality. gods dammit, I thought being with someone would make life easier, not make your flaws all the more obvious.

I have a serious problem. I need to break up with my boyfriend, but I don't know what to do about it.

This is my first major relationship, and I'm still incredibly in love with my boyfriend. He hasn't cheated on me. He hasn't been a piece of shit. I actually love my boyfriend. I really do.

However, my boyfriend and I are long distance (two hours... peanuts I know) and he is completely incapable of using a cell phone. We've seen each other once for less than 24hrs since January, and I simply can't do this anymore. It's like he's absentee. His mind wanders and I know he *means* well but he can't do it. He simply can't pick up his telephone. It's like I'm a second thought for him and at some point I have to have some pride in myself.

The worst bit about this is that he's a great guy. I honestly do wish him the best. I like him a lot. However, we've had chat after chat after chat about him changing his behavior. I've taken responsibility and taken pains to remove my flaws, but he simply can't do the same. Even worse, his family is basically falling apart and, had we met a year later, things might have worked out better. I try so, so very hard to make it work and he simply isn't able to do the same.

I'm actually completely heartbroken that I have to end this relationship. As I write this, tears are sort of coming up and I'm not one to cry, but the sole thing I really want is to cuddle up with him on a couch and I just can't take the separation any longer. It's like pouring salt on my soul.

So I have been contemplating this situation for a while and I thought I would throw it your way to hear some of your opinions on the matter seeing that the thought of it keeps floating around my head anyway.

I'm 23 and there is this guy(henceforth Zack) who I have known for about four years. Six months ago I found out that Zack identifies as bisexual.  He is the type that is very flirty and he has always flirted with me both privately and publicly, but before I knew he was bi I assumed it was just part of his *keep you on your toes, anything goes, get a rise out of people* style.  Now I'm pretty sure he is into me(he has even sent me a nude picture of himself in a crazy pose holding something in front of his package, when he texts he calls me ""qt"" etc.) but he doesn't know outright that I am gay (neither do most of my friends for that matter[im telling my good friends next week{that's another story}]) although I assume he is suspicious and he continues to flirt and feel the situation out.

So Zack is one devilishly handsome, tall, fit, dirty blond scruffy haired mother fucker and me thinks he wants to bang!  I am pretty partial to the idea of sleeping with him myself ;-) and I even had a sex dream about him last night.  He is pretty sexually open and kinky(I know from stories he has shared) he sometimes talks about how he is perpetually horny and I know he would be wild and all around pretty fun in bed(hes got a pretty sizable dick too) but here is the issue.

1) Zack has been known to have a big mouth and share peoples personal business with anyone who will listen.  Being that we have mutual friends I am concerned that he would out me to them before I have a chance to do so on my own terms, although telling him explicitly not to do this might suffice(for a little while at least)

2) Zack doesn't really have any close friends and two mutual friends of ours confided in me that in their opinion he didn't exactly have an easy childhood and he doesn't know how to be real with people on some levels.  He is very smart(we have great intellectual debates that I cant have with many other people) but I think he still feels inadequate in some ways and he try's to compensate by being crass and pretending not to give a fuck about anyone or anything in a sort of nihilistic fashion(which, perhaps oddly, kind of makes him that much more attractive to me) , one of my friends is even of the opinion that Zack is somewhat of a sociopath.  In my opinion, however, I think he just needs some good friends who steer him in the right direction and don't just have him around for the entertainment value of cheep laughs.  I am by no means looking for a serious relationship with this guy and I am not trying to be his 'Dr. Phil' these are just my observations of the situation and I think that by staying platonic friends we could both benefit (we would be each others only LGBT friends/wingmen and he could benefit from a close friend who isn't a douche)  and by sleeping together we might mess up the friendship. But a friends with benefits situation would be the optimal outcome I suppose ;-) 

At first I had told myself that I wouldn't sleep with Zack despite my being attracted to him, but lately I feel like I might regret it if I don't take advantage of the opportunity.

**TL;DR:** I have a hot bi friend who wants to bang, I wanna sleep with him but im worried he might out me to friends before I have a chance to do it myself/we might be better off friends.

The idea that some women are madonnas (pure, chaste, whatever), and some are whores (sexy, dumb, objects for gratification). It's obviously not a good way to see the world, but especially because it causes some damage to relationships where men can't get off with their Madonnas because they seem them as pristine and can't date their Whores because they don't respect them.

Anyway, I apparently am a victim of the gay version. I love nothing more than fucking the shit out a trashy little twink, but I have no desire to date any of them. However, when I meet a super-hot, super-sweet, super-intelligent boy that I actually want to DATE, all of my animal instinct flies out the door. More than occasionally I have trouble keeping an erection and all of my *sex skillz* fizzle out. My nerves kick in, and I worry about treating them respectfully. That often just ends in cuddling because I'm not ready to go. I know that I should be able to fuck a guy like a whore and then treat him like a gentleman the rest of the time, but I'm finding that juxtaposition difficult to sit with...

I want to be with a boy who I respect and cherish in the street and can confidently screw like a whore in the sheets, to paraphrase an Usher lyric. However, once I start being able to fuck a boy without hesitation or self-consciousness, that usually means I've lost interest and will be breaking up with him soon...

FYI: I've never had a successful long-term relationship that didn't end shortly after we started having sex, mainly because once I had sex with him I started thinking of him as a Whore rather than a Madonna. I've started putting off sex as long as possible to avoid this.

Any advice?

It is definitely easier to brush off my nerves and worry less about ""respect"" when I'm a little drunk (not too drunk, that gives me whiskey dick). It also helps when we're doing it doggy style so I don't have to look at his face and can just think of him as an ass to fuck. However, that only lasts so long before we start having more sex and he starts wanting me to be the big brute masc top I want to be too... but can't so long as I respect him.

Anyways, I've been seeing a guy for the past few weeks, and fooling around with him has gotten me thinking. I've been with several guys now (13, I think), and hooking up with each one of them has involved blowjobs, handjobs, etc. However, I've never done anal with a guy. I want to, and I'm not saving my (anal) virginity for anything special, but for whatever combination of reasons, it just hasn't happened yet. 

The guy I'm currently seeing has said he'd be willing to help me lose it, which I'm totally cool with, if we end up choosing to do so.

Here's my problem: whenever I've been with a guy and we get into ass stuff (namely fingering), I just can't do it. The first finger is usually fine, with a little discomfort. But as soon as the second finger goes in (or god forbid a third one make it in), the pain becomes unbearable. I break into a sweat and become unable to keep a hard on, and only can take it for a few minutes before I have to tell the guy to stop. Even if he's being slow and considerate, it's still too much for me. This has happened every single time I've ever been fingered.

I've read the blogs, the other posts, etc. I know to relax. Whenever I practice by myself with my own fingers or small dildo, I have no problems and it feels awesome, perhaps because I know every move I'm about to make. When I put another guy in control, my body freaks out. 

What am I doing wrong, bros? Am I cut out to be a bottom? The thought of getting impaled by a hot guy has gotten me off for as long as I can remember, but even a little fingering is unattainable for me. Is there something I could be doing to get better at this, or do I just need to suck it up and power through the pain? Do I just not want it enough? Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

His pics were very cute and we had a lot in common based on his profile, so I was pretty excited. We started messaging a bit and added each other on Facebook, but at some point the messages kind of died down and he didn't seem to be messaging me back with much enthusiasm; he wasn't being mean he just seemed to lose interest. I was disappointed but that happens and I didn't blame him, so I just moved on. 

Well fast forward a few months and out of the blue I get a fb message from him that says, ""I feel like I should apologize for Facebook stalking you :P"" Now this through me for a loop because I had assumed he wasn't interested, but that is also a message you wouldn't really send to someone you aren't interested in right? So with new hopes I started messaging him again. I found out that, like me, he plays League of Legends (an online game) and so we exchanged Skype names and in-game names and started playing together while chatting over Skype. We've been doing that for awhile now and having a great time. He lives pretty far away from my hometown (but close to my school city) so when I happened to be driving through his city I asked him out to dinner. We went out and it seemed to go really well in my opinion, he asked for a hug at the end, and said he'd be interested in doing it again. 

A few more possible dates/hang outs came up but he ended up unable to go each time for one reason or another, and I started questioning again where he was interested, but then (I think) he actually asked me out, (he invited me to go to a concert with him and offered to get us tickets). I agreed, and also invited him to my birthday celebration next week. The concert isn't for awhile either. I decided that at my birthday celebration I'm going to try flirting a little more to test the waters and see if he's interested, but the suspense is killing me. I'd really like to just know if he's interested or not. So here's where I need advice: I'm tempted to send one of those typical messages confessing my feelings and seeing if he feels the same, just so I know. But I'm not sure if I should, and I'm not sure about the timing. I feel like I shouldn't send it until after my bday celebration so it's not awkward if he doesn't feel the same and so I can try scoring some points while we're hanging out, but it's also killing me to not know. What do I do?

I'm a 24 year old guy, been in the military since I was 17, and raised in a Irish Catholic home. As far back as I remember I've known I've had an attraction to guys. I started dating women around the age of 14 or 15 and to keep them happy down the road, I would end up having sex with them. I enjoyed it, never had to much issue performing, but I never really had an emotional connection to any of them.

Due to my upbringing and time in the military, I never went after guys, although a there were a few instances where guys would come onto me, and that's the only experience I had with guys until recently. I felt myself actually being attracted to them in those situations, and it was so much better for me than anything I've done with women.

Now that I'm getting out of the military soon, I felt like I can finally be honest with myself and to my friends. I've told a few close friends that I am bi, but now I'm not so sure. After reading some of the other posts, and talking to  a few friends of mine, I'm thinking I may be gay. 

tl;dr So my problem is, that I only feel a connection to guys, and not to women, but I've had no problem having sex with women. I'm worried now that I'm coming out that I may be hiding behind the possibility of being bi, rather than just coming out as gay. So does it sound like I'm bi or gay?

The best way I have to describe how I feel is with these lyrics :

''(Oh) Is it my faults?

You fell into the illusion you've been living discretely.

(Oh) Should I blame you in the end?

Did you ever think the sketches would take over completely?

(Oh is it my fault?) [x2]

Just die!

You are filth!

Choke on blood as your knife ends the show! Writhe the pain you thought you'd never know!

I don't think they dig graves close enough to hell for the likes of you! [x2]

I handed you a knife and my heart (oh, oh),

I handed you a knife and my heart (oh, oh), and now the dream is over...

And now the dream is over...''

This has a lot of signification for me because I remember once he asked me what was my biggest dream and I answered ''To be happy, which you are making me feel right now.'' and he did everything he could so I would be happy for the time we saw eachother, and all of a sudden he just destoyed everything.

He's my first boyfriend of two months and he's had another boyfriend who he has had sex with. I;m still pretty damn new to it. I haven't been able to top so I tried to bottom.

I've tried topping and I couldn't stay hard, then I read a Dan Savage article where he suggested someone to bottom first and then topping would feel better. I'm jacking off a couple days ago while I'm really into it, and I felt like I could have a dick up my butt. I fingered, but the need to poop was there when I got to my second sphincter.

So, I ask my bf to try topping me. He rims and gets to fingering, I'm getting used to it. He finally tries to top, I'm still kind of tight. He's getting it in, it still hurts. He tries thrusting slowly a couple times, but it still hurts so I tell him to just stop. I probably should have just taken the pain. Anyway, before he stopped be thrusts quickly a couple times and it hurt pretty badly. 

That just took me off guard, I'm still getting used to it and he does that? At first I thought it was kind of funny, he likes to mess around sometimes. Then I figure it was going too far, but I still kind of liked that he went that far and it wasn't excruciatingly painful. (Maybe I could have gotten used to it, I thought). It also felt like real sex. Also, there was shit involved. I'm not sure what time it came out, but it was a little. That didn't bother me. The fact that he trusted while I'm still getting used to it still bothers me. Maybe I'm just being a baby and I should have taken it. He did reach my prostate, but it felt like I needed to pee and eventually a little good with pain.

edit: I forgot to add that I did let him know right after we cleaned up that it hurt and that it bothered me since I'm just trying it, but also that I kind of liked it just not now. I also let him know that if he asked I would have said yes to more aggressive stuff to try it out. He said sorry and promised to not do it again.

I'm 23 years old and over the past year or so I've finally become comfortable enough with myself to come out to my closest friends, and the whole process has been fantastic. These friends (mostly straight bros) have been completely supportive and awesome. I asked them to keep my being gay to themselves, so even though a handful of my friends know, I'm still mostly closeted. I'm almost at a point where I'm ready to just throw caution to the winds and just come out for real. What I'm wondering is: how to do it? I don't really like the idea of telling close friends and then just letting it percolate out, and having other people hear it second-hand through the gossip-train; I would rather people hear it from me. But obviously that's not practical or realistic when there are hundreds of people I interact with in my life. I could make a post on Facebook, but if I simply posted ""hey all, I'm gay"" or changed my ""interested in"" to ""men"" I know that people will think it's just a joke or a prank (even my best friends thought I was joking when I told them I was gay). Also I fear that this might be a little too personal for something like Facebook -- I'm typically a fairly private person and the thought of posting something so personal there makes me a little uncomfortable, although it would certainly be an easy way to get everyone on the same page. I've been tempted to post a little essay on facebook just kind of explaining everything, but that seems a little trite. 

My straight bros are discouraging me from making a post on facebook. They say that the point of coming out isn't to necessarily make every person around me know, but to simply be comfortable with people finding out naturally and not being evasive about it.

We had been hanging out a lot and bonding and he trusted me with the information. When he came out to me about it we were actually at a gay club and he took me aside to tell me. I had so many questions for him because this was the first person I really knew who was HIV positive. We took the conversation into the bathroom because he had to pee and I couldn't hear him that well over all that thumpa thumpa. Then his boyfriend of several months knocked on the door and we opened it and he thought we were hooking up in the bathroom or something because he got mad and threw a huge fit. It really caught me off guard and surprised me. I thought his reaction was just fake at first. I am not at all attracted to my friend and he is not attracted to me in that way and all of our friends know this (we are both bottoms and Kiven is a potato queen). So my friend's boyfriend has caused this huge scene and runs out of the club in the middle of downtown and we chase after him. I tell my friend Kiven, why don't I just go up to his boyfriend and tell him the truth that we were having a heart to heart conversation about his HIV status. Surely he would understand. But Kiven tells me not too so I just let it go. Actually the next morning I find out Kiven and his boyfriend broke up.

So now that I have found out about my good friend's HIV status I start to think about everything he has told me in the past - about all of his prior sexual partners he's bragged about. There's this hairstylist who his good friends with our group of friends that Kiven has bragged about having bareback sex with as a hookup. I didn't think anything of it at the time because I didn't know his status. I assumed the hairstylist was positive as well because why would they have bareback sex, right? Anyways, I ended up telling the hairstylist a few weeks later about it when he tried to hit on me on grindr. I asked him his status and he said he was negative. I was like ""well have you been tested recently because I know you had bareback sex with Kiven."" He said Kiven didn't tell him about his status at all.

So not long, actually quite soon after my friend Kiven has broke up with his ex, he jumps into a relationship. He's one of those guys that can't be single for so long. They ended up dating for 6 months. Last night I found by surprise that they broke up - I noticed my friend Kiven was on grindr. One of our good friends told me he actually ran into Kiven on a date a few weeks ago during the time when he was still together with his boyfriend. So I ran into Kiven's boyfriend (an older rice queen) at the gay club last night and asked him if they broke up. I had seen him out two days prior and everything about their relationship seemed fine then. He said they did and I asked him why. Then, I don't know if I was drunk, I don't think I was *that* drunk honestly, but I asked him - ""was it because of his status?"" Kiven's boyfriend is known as a worry-wort about STDs. It is revealed that after 6 months of dating and having sex, Kiven had not told his boyfriend about his HIV status. I basically outed someone's boyfriend to them.


I feel like I definitely crossed the line and it was not my place to tell Kiven's ex-boyfriend about his HIV status. I love my friend Kiven, a lot. He's really funny, a little older than me, and I look up to him. Kiven has been calling and texting me, he knows what happened because his ex told him last night about everything I said - so we, Kiven and I, need to have a conversation. What I need help with is how to approach this conversation. I feel like I did wrong but then another part of me felt there was an ethical component to what I did. For me personally, I would hate it if someone slept with me willingly withholding their HIV status. I know I shouldn't care about other people's relationships but I feel at unease when my good friend is always making jokes and always bringing up his hookups and sexual conquests. One of my friends suggested I just blame last night's admission on the alcohol. I wasn't trying to maliciously harm my friend Kiven or ruin any relationships I was just seriously concerned. I don't think Kiven will see that though.



How should I approach this conversation? What should I do? I still want to be Kevin's friend.

It was difficult at first, I was kinda heartbroken, but I've moved on since and been proactive, I hid his newsfeeds from my facebook too so I wouldn't be reminded of him. I was at a point where he occupied little to none of my thoughts.

Also, I've had a big crush on this guy (always have thought he's really attractive) and my ex knew that. I have since also hid my friend's newsfeed so I don't come across anymore of their communication.

So I'm currently going through some major changes in my life right now.  I'm getting out of a relationship, with someone who I've been in with for two and a half years.  There's a very good chance I'm moving to Canada.  I'm finishing my job and going back to school full time as a 30 year old student and pursuing a masters degree.  To add to the list, there is a potential love interest as well.  

All in all, I'm happy with these changes.  It feels like my relationship ended few months ago. It has at least ended emotionally.  Sex isn't the same.  Furthermore, my current partner is exuding off a negative energy.  Which can suck an individual's energy.  Mind you it also could be a two way street.  I get tired of putting up with the negative shit.  I get pissed off. He gets pissed off.  And now we have more than what we started with.

Moving back to Canada makes sense to me.  Not for the reason there is another guy there (will discuss this later).  But it's cheaper for me to live, compared to NYC.  The tuition is cheaper.  Plus, I can actually work in Canada as a student, since I'm not allowed to make any money as a student in the States.   With my overall goal of being able to be self-sufficient, this is what it seems like I need to do.

Now, the potential other guy (we will call him G).  This is where I'm getting anxiety from.  I've known G for 7 years now.  I originally met him on Gay.com.  During those 7 years I never physically met him, we talked off and on during that time.  We helped each other through each other's relationships and just life in general.  In March, he was coming into the city and we finally met.

Our time together was brief. He had to go somewhere with his friend.  But the time we had together was amazing.  Furthermore, when he touched me, I never had that feeling before.  My whole body tingled it seemed.  We had to part ways, sadly. But we said we'd meet again.  Fast forward to May!

I had to fly back up to Canada to get business shit done.  So I met with G a few times.  There was nothing sexual (as in intercourse: oral or anal).  There was kissing and cuddling. That was it. 

 Anyhow, I always known I had feelings for G over the 7 years.  But when our paths first crossed, I got a taste of what there was.  Then back in Canada, it was solidified that my feelings for him were much more than I anticipated.  

G and I had a talk about our situation.  We both concluded now that it is best to be friends for the time being.  Due to my situation of not sure where I will be and ending a relationship.  And his situation: he has been burned before he says, in a similar situation.  This guy means a lot to me, and I don't want him to be the rebound guy.  It's not fair to him in the slightest.  So we decided to wait and if we are ready for something in a few months, a year we will explore our feelings for each other.

The part that kills me though, is he says he's not ready for a relationship.  He has commitment issues. The last two guys who wanted to be serious with him he shut down and ended what the had.  Yet, on the other hand, he told me he has been single for 3 years and he can't wait.  It's also weird for me, that I have to ""battle"" for a relationship.  My past two boyfriends where all about ""you like me.  I like you.  Let's get together!""

My biggest fear and that I may not get to explore my feelings for him and he may find some other guy.  Thinking about this upsets me somewhat. But I concluded what G and I have is something we can't rush, and it has to take its own course.

So yeah, that's about it.  Some big changes in my life, and more about some guy

Possible NSFW",yewww,14,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1dzbu1/confused_about_my_boyfriend_and_our_relationship/,"Sorry if this ends up a little long winded, but it's been playing on my mind for a little bit now. I've been going out with my boyfriend for nearly 8 months now, and he is pretty much everything that I could ask for. Intelligent, ambitious, caring. However recently (probably in the past 2-3 months) I have noticed he is a lot less affectionate and intimate towards me, and sex has pretty much fallen off the radar.

We are both 23 and he is my first relationship (and first dude I have even kissed) whereas he has had 2 boyfriends, and hooked up with a couple of dudes before me. When we first had sex he told me had lost his virginity, only as a top though. 2 months down the track he tells me he actually lied about that, and that I was his first as well.

So, I had problems topping him (performance anxiety when putting on the condom) so I would always bottom more or less, with him trying to help me out topping him. I would consider myself a 99% bottom, with the odd urge to top once in a blue moon, but would always attempt it when he was keen because I wanted him to experience bottoming.

So about a month or two ago I topped him. I couldn't cum but he eventually did. Usually we would have a laugh, cuddle, kiss and what not after sex as you usually do, but this time he seemed a little distant and went straight to sleep. I figured he must have been tired and what not so I thought nothing of it.

For the next two weeks he became kind of distant, where usually he would invite me out for drinks at the pub with his mates, he had a couple of parties on where he didn't ask me, but I just figured maybe he wanted some time with his friends, so left him be for a little bit. After not seeing each other for over a week (little weird for us) he said he would pop around my place if he had time after work, to which I replied 'no problem, can crash at mine too'. He came around for like 40 minutes, and ended up going home. We had dinner a couple of days later and watched a movie in my room where he stayed. I started kissing him, things got a little heavier, then he moved from kissing with tongue to closed mouths to just pecks. I got the hint and went to bed. We ended up going to dinner and one of his mates places a couple of days after. I initiated sex, he was rock hard and drooling precum. He didn't engage any type of anal, I came from a handjob, but he said he couldn't cum (only happened once before, and he had a lot on his mind thinking that perhaps I was going to get over him and regret that I had never hooked up with anyone but him).

After that I didn't see him for a week again. It was his birthday so I took him out for dinner. We end up back at his watching a movie, I start stroking his shaved chest hair, he tells me to jokingly stop, I keep doing it, then he gets kind of angry so I stop. We kiss innocently and cuddle for a bit, and I am stroking his neck. He tells me to stop again, kind of forcefully. It all seems a little weird so I ask him if everything is alright. He replies yeah, everything is fine then puts his arm around me and he goes to sleep. 

I had to leave in quite abruptly in the middle of the night due to family stuff. He was really helpful the next couple of days, messaging me all the time, making sure I was alright, offering for me to stay at his if need be, call anytime I needed to talk. I met up with him mid week and explained why I left in the middle of the night, made sure it had nothing to do with him, and then asked if there was anything on his mind. He said that he really didn't enjoy bottoming, like not at all. He didn't want to say it, because he thought it would be a boring sex life for me if I couldn't top him, but I said I don't really get much out of it, and we decided that I would be the bottom, him the top. I'm happy with this. I also mentioned how he had been distant the past couple of weeks (he said he didn't realise) and that it felt like I was always initiating sex. He said he was just acting weird cause of the whole top/bottom situation. 

I figured this might have solved all the affection, being intimate, sex problems on his side. So I told him he could stay at mine Friday night. He kind of went all awkward, shuffling around and said 'ah i've got to cook some wings for your party tomorrow... (long pause)... oh and wash my bike'. I figured he would jump at the chance to have sex after this really honest conversation, and that the excuse he gave was pretty damn lame. 

I message him saturday morning asking if he could bring some stuff for the party, and says he will after he washes his car (yet he originally said bike) He comes over and mentions how he went to his friends uni recital thing on Friday night in conversation to one of my friends. I pass it off as just a change of plans or something. Were all drunk as we go to bed, and to be honest this is usually the only time he has seemed to really want and initiate sex (besides the first 2 months of lust), but instead we kiss for a bit and we go to bed. 

Last night we go to the movies, I of course am the one to kiss him hello, he doesn't touch me, hold my hand, or anything the entire night and I kiss him goodnight and he goes on his way home. 

Now what I have said here might seem extremely high school and stupid to you guys, but this is my first relationship and I don't really understand whats going on here. It just seems so weird going from having sex like 2-4 times a week, to literally once a month if not longer recently. I honestly feel like I have the sex life of a 50 year old married couple. With the past couple of weeks and the lack of affection and sex, I have honestly felt like we are nothing more than friends, because if we are hanging out, we have a laugh and have fun. I know sex and affection and intimate type behaviour is going to drop off a little bit after 8 months or so, but surely it shouldn't be like this with two dudes in their early twenties. It can't be an attraction thing, as when I do initiate and he partakes, he is rock hard and oozing pre-cum. Also, not to sound arrogant, I have been told I am a pretty attractive guy. Is it simply a case of him just not that being into me anymore, and he is too scared to break it of? 

I could use some input here from anyone who has experienced something similar, as it is doing my head in.

I told him that I was actually kind of busy with studying, and feeling a bit overwhelmed with school and that I am excited to see him tomorrow. He seemed a little peeved in his response, saying he was just going to come by for a minute, but that he'll see me later.

So my question is, am I unreasonable to expect a few afternoons 'off' every week? He works out of town on weekends, so I already know that I'm going to be free then, but I'm SO used to my independence and having my alone time that I was just getting a bit overwhelmed with this so suddenly.

I didn't allow having multiple partners [addition at first, I wanted our relationship to be monogamous until we get financial independent]. But I'm open to do anything (yes, anything for him and anybody he involves) for him now. I love my boyfriend more than myself and I care about him more than my life.

My mom threatened me [infront of him] to send me to jail without having any proof at all of our having a sexual relationship. He said the same thing, [recently]. He even tells me to die. I always say the opposite that I want him to live forever! And its amazing how the things he hated about my mom are exactly those things which he is saying [now]. But this is another matter. The issue is VERY clear in my mind, I cannot live without him. Believe me, I've thought about it many many times. But I cannot overcome the feelings he gave me plus my history and his history is very very close to me. The history is layered very deep, I fear recalling the happy moments, I want to recall them but I fear the worst.

I'm a type who CANNOT leave. Why? Because in my childhood my parents fought a lot. And I promised myself I'd never do that! But somehow, I become that idiot that everybody starts hating. Not exactly hating but somebody who ""pesters"". In the beginning they like it and then I become the childish-bad-person. Anyway, now my story.

My gay boyfriend went away to study in Germany and then UK. I had no previous sexual experience. And neither I ever wish to make any after him. [The emotions I went through were enough to make me a commit for life.]

Now it has been two years. He says, he does not want to come back. And that he hates me. We were in a relationship for two years. And add a year 1.5 in which he did contact me to his heart content. He has simply told me to ""move on!""

Now, I'm missing him BIG TIME! And I've no way to express my feelings. He has cut all contact. Now he says, when I try to contact him that I ""pester him"", ""I don't need you any more"" and very sad stuff like that.

I just know that I will NEVER and WILL NOT want to have any relationship other than him in my LIFE.

My gay boyfriend was abused as a child for over 2 years by an older guy. I, in my teens started taking interest in big burly uncle type men (which he didn't like!).

I've so much common with my BABY! And I so much want him. And I know this FEELING inside me will never end and I cry day and night!

And the country I live in, will take a 100 years to accept me let alone we as a couple.

He is very very very emotional. I'm very very very emotional too. And he keeps on disconnecting the call and sometimes for weeks he doesn't even let me contact him by any means.

I've allowed him to have as much fun as he wants. ""Just don't leave me"". But it seems, I'm just helpless. Its just sad and sad and sad.
I've no urge to continue living by the way. And this break up has continued at a time when I'm doing my research work (humanities) and I've not written a single word for more than a month now.

Breakup occurred because I didn't visit him in Berlin and now he is London where he is living with his family. I was studying that's why I couldn't visit him and he was studying as well. 

And basically we needed money to apply and we couldn't ask from our parents. Everything according to his standards should never be known. 

It's just sad. I'm not a person who'd hide anything from my family. And because of this situation, I had to confront my family. And I did. No positive outcome, but they know at least. At least the female members of my family. And two friends. 

""I LOVE YOU! WITH ALL MY HEART"" if ever my boyfriend reads it. This is for him. My life, he I keep on breathing will be spent searching for him. I hope no Gatsby [The Great Gatsby] scene occurs at the end. He would even hate me writing about it. Though, I've mentioned nothing that reveals him.

I'm new to the website and decided to kind of vent and get your opinion on what's going on with my life. Here's the background.

I'm currently 24, black, single, and never been in a relationship; I've always known I was gay since I was 13 years old. I'm still not out to family and most friends. For most of my life I've been super focused on academics and extracurriculars; volunteering, graduating at the top of my high school class, sports, etc. I had the opportunity to attend a great university majoring in engineering. It basically took up my entire life, so I didn't have much time for socializing and at least having the gay experience/awakening at college. Again, I was focused on academics and a little naive to what was out there.

I had no idea about a gay community until my senior year when I became close friends with a guy I was interning with. We talked everything and sexuality naturally came up. I suspected he was gay, and I ended up telling him that I was, but never acted out on my feelings. He introduced me to Grindr, which opened up a place I never knew existed in society. I experimented very little, but it was still an eye-opening thing for me.

Fast forward a year, I'm in the middle of bumfuck Texas with a great paying, stressful job. Obviously in that location there wasn't a lot of bros, so I went out to Houston on the weekends, but it's just not the same as having a network or community nearby. Whenever I was out in Houston, I never really got much attention at bars or on any apps, got rejected, but I kind of shrugged it off at first. I'm seriously lonely, stressed, but making great money at my job, but the environment I worked in was very toxic and homophobic and it came from people I depended on learning from. I never really said anything about it but it cut me even more deeply. I start looking up opportunities, and eventually took a position in MO that pays a lot less, but somewhere I think will be a better social environment. I've been here for around two months and I just went out in the gayborhood tonight and I feel/notice a recurring issue that I did before: I don't seem to be an attractive person to any guy. 

Bottom line is that I'm having a lot of trouble meeting decent looking, professional, smart guys that are into me. By all means on paper, I'd consider myself to be a good catch. I'm young, have a good job and stable income, driven to do better in life, stay active and workout regularly, and consider myself to be good-looking. I'm blessed to have had the opportunities and to be in great health and sound mind, but it's not comforting in my loneliness. 

I'm not limiting myself to any race and only prefer masculine guys. A relationship would be idea, but I'm not limiting myself to that either. Great friends to go out with, a FWB, or even a hookup would be great. I'm just having no luck with any of them. I know Grindr and other apps aren't the best ways to look for guys, but even tonight when I went out, there was this air of pretentiousness among the guys at multiple bars/clubs that I wasn't good enough. I joined serious dating website; no luck with that either.  

I'm afraid that I made the wrong decision to move up here, primarily with the hopes that I would be able to find THE guy, and have a network of gaybros that would somewhat complete my life. Does anybody have any advice or done anything similar in their lives? Am I doing something wrong or is there something I could improved? Even though I don't know anybody's racial background on here, are most black guys not considered to be attractive (or the preference of choice) by other races? Am I wrong in my reasoning that my relationship and friendship options are severely limited due to the lack of black guys in the gay community and how we are looked at by others in the community?

Looking for some advice on a situation that a lot of us have seemed to struggle with: 

In a rough patch with my boy and wondering what's the right balance between sharing feelings vs. playing it cool? For me specifically (if you want to see background below), or just in general...

I've been ""seeing"" a fellow bro since last fall. We never gave it official labels, but we became pretty close. Usually text every day (or close to it), sleepovers most weekends, movie nights, some dinners, etc. We've met each other's friends, and both of us said we don't like the thought of each other getting with anyone else. 

Now we seem to have hit a rough patch and haven't gotten together in a couple weeks and our typical back-and-forth texting has also dropped way down. 

I'm not oblivious to the signs... But I've asked him a couple times and he's said everything is fine and there's nothing to worry about. Just bad timing and a tough schedule. So now I'm torn. 

Do I choose to believe him and back off a bit? Play it cool and give it some space to see if the situation improves? Even at the risk (if we're drifting apart) of losing a last chance to tell him how much I like him and try to make it right? 

Or do I lay it all out? Tell him how much I like him and that I want him in my life regularly, and seriously, for the long haul? Even at the risk of coming on too strong and scaring him further off? Or seeming overly clingy? 

Anyone have experiences like this? Is there any way to balance the two?  To lay out some feelings, but in a way that isn't overbearing and likely to backfire? 

This bro is torn and confused by the whole situation, so I'd appreciate any advice, strategies, or lessons from similar experiences. ",,False,,t5_2vgfw,False,,,True,t3_1cnoyr,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1cnoyr/playing_cool_vs_sharing_feelings_balance/,

Pros VS Cons [Albany NY],Elranzer,14,0,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1clzci/should_i_move_to_an_exciting_bigger_city_or/,"Alright, for science [this is me](http://i.imgur.com/xdcuJhg.jpg) (name's Will, 30 years old, how are you??) and the city I am based in is Albany, NY. It's a mid-sized area (metro area,from Albany to Saratoga, is about 800,000 people). I'm 30 and I've lived here all my life, from birth to college to all of my professional jobs. (Also, [this is my cat](http://i.imgur.com/OYJwV.jpg), Tiger).

But I'm getting antsy to move, and it's mainly because the dating pool here SUCKS. Though most of my dating experience is online-based, that could be my problem.

The most common piece of advice given around here is to move to a bigger, better city. And I'm totally for that, for myself, and giving that advice to others. But do I consider reasons other than a shitty dating scene? Here's my pros and cons...

Pros:

* My parents are still alive (and only in their early 50s), still together, still living in the house I grew up in, and I have a great relationship with them. They don't plan on moving.
* I have many friends (most of them straight), some of which go back to my childhood. So we're talking about 25-year friendships still going strong. They have no intention of moving.
* I have a steady, middle-class IT/library job. I have healthcare benefits, it's full-time, Mon-Fri, 8-4, my paid vacation and sick leave are two separate pools, I'm in the NY State pension system (which recently froze off for new employees), and my boss doesn't care how long my lunch breaks go, and I don't have to clock in or out. I'm even unionized.
* Albany is *very* convenient. We have three highways that circle the city, so you can exit the city on one side, take a short highway drive, and be anywhere else in the city with 10 minutes. No crazy driving or traffic like DC, SF, and other places. It's like NYC Jr as far as grid-like roads, but with the bonus of highways circling the city.
* Albany has a ton of great places to eat. A lot of NYC people, along with Buffalo, Montreal and Boston people, move here for the cheaper cost of living and bring their big city cooking skills and open up great restaurants.
* It's a short, easy drive or Amtrak train ride to Montreal, NYC or Boston. In 2-3 hours, I'm in one of those big 3 awesome cities that's 100x better than Albany but without having to deal with their cost of living.
* Flights out of Albany International Airport are relatively cheap, thanks to Southwest, and many are direct flights. I frequent to Orlando, which has non-stops between it and Albany.

Cons

* The dating scene sucks.
* The snow also sucks.

So... what do you think? Is shitty dating scene enough of a reason to move when the rest of my living situation is... alright?

Does anyone know an easy and affordable solution to this?  I've used an electric razor, but I'm not very flexible and it's such an effort to get it all.

We have a lot in common, and I know we both like spending our time together.

He's very open when he's drunk, and we've drunkenly talked about being in a relationship. On Saturday, in our last drunken pillow talk, we decided we wouldn't hook up with other people. I asked him today if he remembered our talk, and he said yes. I asked if that meant a relationship, and he said he's never dated a guy before and is nervous about putting a label on things. Although I've been out for quite some time, I've never actually had a genuine relationship, either. 

My worry is that it's hard for him to open up and tell me what he wants when he's sober. I find it hard to ask him questions about us and us doing things together (sleeping over, cuddling, etc) because I'm never sure if he only likes it when we're drunk, or if he's okay with it when we're sober too.

I'm fairly confident this all stems from him still being somewhat uncomfortable of himself being interested in men. He identifies as bi, which is completely okay with me. He's assured me that he does in fact have feelings for me, and would like us to keep seeing each other. I told him we don't have to put a label on things until he's comfortable.

Has anyone else been in a situation like this and has any advice? I'm hoping he gets more comfortable with me as time goes on, and that he realizes he can say what he wants when he's sober as well as drunk.

Just turned 20, studying in college bi(lean towards gay) and with ADHD and I feel completely and utterly alone at the moment.

This year started off kind of great, living with my best friend and his girlfriend (stupid mistake but I guess I have to experience it to learn from it.) It was good except things started to go south (no pun intended) with my ADHD habits coming out especially with houseworks (note that the best friend also has ADHD but undiagnosed.) And s*** just got worse and worse. We haven't talked for 2-3 weeks now with him trying to kick me out (legally he can't but haven't explained that to him yet knowing he wouldn't be able to understand it with his naive and somewhat ehem, stupid, mind.)

And I don't have anyone I can talk to, college counseling is next to useless, not a great family relationship (haven't came out and they are against homosexuality) and with exams piling up, I can't ask my friends to always be there for me (which is what I need to not breakdown every fifteen minutes or so.)

Besides, on the outside, I seem to not have any worry in the world, a top in the class student, a president of a big club, summer internship opportunity (I'm honestly not being narcissistic, I'm just trying to put things to context because I do hate talking about shit in my life and pretty much always end up talking about the positive part and helping other people with their problems.) But nobody knows that I'm breaking down inside. Nobody came to my birthday this year (bad combination of timing and emergencies and some delayed flights) and so I spent my birthday drinking by myself in a bar. Pathetic right?

What should I do?

Things got weird, and I had to kiss his neck (for reasons not entirely worth going into).

Anyway, a short time later, he asked me out, and I gave him my number. We texted the rest of the night, and he met back up with us for bar close. I walked him to his car, and we hugged. He seemed really excited about our date, and I was too.

On Monday, when i saw him at the group, I said ""how's it going?"" All I got back was ""Eh, it's monday.""

Nothing the rest of the night. He didn't talk to me, look in my direction, text me, anything. I went home thinking he wasn't interested, and figured I would check in on Wednesday to see if our plans for Thursday were still there.

Tuesday morning, he texted me and told me that he had made plans previously that he couldn't get out of, and that he was really sorry, but he had to cancel. I wasn't surprised, and told him it was ok. He kept saying he felt really bad, and I told him I understood, but that if he ever wanted to try again, he should hit me up.

I found out later that he had injured himself on Monday, and that may have explained the mood change, but I'm not sure.

Now, I'm assuming he wasn't interested, and that he was trying to politely blow me off. I don't want to come off as paranoid, so I don't know how to ask him that. This isn't something I'd avoid him over (the same thing happened before with someone else, and now we're great friends), but I don't want to hold out hope that a date will happen when it won't.

What do you guys think? Did I get blown off? Should I ask him, and if so, how?

I'm pretty embarrassed about it, but I need to ask to see if I can get some guidance on it.

So, I'm 100% I'm gay, I definitely like men, but when it comes to anal sex I've been having some ""issues"". I've heard some people say that anal sex is not for everyone, I honestly don't want to rule it out yet. When I watch it on porn it turns me on, and when I simulate it and pretend to do it while rolling around in bed with a guy it turns me on. 
But when I get down to doing the actual thing I've got a lot of improvement to do...

I've tried to top twice and I honestly can't get hard, I lose my erection really quickly...I don't know if it's a mental thing, but I honestly get soft when I'm about to do it. 

I've bottomed three times, with two different guys. With the first guy, it felt kinda uncomfortable and I asked him to pull out after about 2 or 3 minutes, he did. I figured, since it was the first time it would feel uncomfortable, and that was just normal. 

Recently, I've bottomed two more times, with this guy I'm currently seeing and who I really like. I've found that my favorite positions are either missionary or where I'm on top of him, those are my favorite because I feel the most comfortable, but I have yet to feel any pleasure per say. I guess I like the fact that he enjoys it, that makes me feel good, but I don't get a feeling of pleasure from the penetration. Instead, and I hope I'm not the only one who's experienced this...when I'm getting fucked (and especially when he thrusts at a faster pace) I get the sensation that I'm going to basically shit...it's really weird, uncomfortable and nerve-racking...so much so that I ask him to slow down not so much cause it hurts but because of this sensation and it worries me about when might happen. I've taken precautions and make sure I watch what I eat and I douche and clean up down there before getting down to business, but I still worry that something might happen because of this feeling...and it gets to the point that I loose my erection cause that feeling bothers me so much. I don't want to tell him, cause it's a huge mood killer to be like ""um yeah, when you fuck me I get this feeling where like I wanna go do #2"" haha...So my question is how do I get to the point where I actually enjoy bottoming and don't have this overwhelming feeling and fear that I'm going to take a shit? I really hope this is common, haha...I've thought about buying a dildo and trying that out and getting used to bottoming with that at my own pace.

Slight backstory first: My current boyfriend of almost 2 years is my first guy. Him, on the other hand, he is pretty experienced. He always tells me stories about this stuff he did with this guy and that guy, etc. Now, I know it's all in the past, but I can't help it from bothering me. But it's not so much bothering me that he's slept with so many guys. It's more the fact that I haven't had any of those experiences. So I try to create some stuff with him and me, but he just isn't fully into it. Yes, we hook up. But he always says he's ""older"" experience-wise so it doesn't interest him anymore. He just wants the normal stuff.

Now on to last night. We went to the gay club for Mardi Gras. We've been to this club before and I had a great time. And I had a pretty good time last night too. It's just that, he is constantly getting hit on by guys all night. He was literally just standing at the bar with me behind him. Some guy swooped in past me and started talking to him. I was slightly okay with it because some guy had just walked pas me and said something, so I was feeling better about myself. But then, we decided we wanted to leave. As we were walking out, some guy walked past him and grabbed him, said something to him, and then kept walking. We got out the door and had a bottle of water with us that we were told we couldn't bring outside. So we went back in to finish our water. When we got back in, my boyfriend said ""good, maybe I can go talk to that guy now."" This set me off. I told him sure, go ahead. Go do what you gotta do. He usually doesn't fully go through with going to talk to whatever guy, but this time he did. So after he walked off, I threw my water away and left. I was pissed.

But...I wasn't really pissed that he was going to talk to the guy, well I guess not really. I was more pissed that he just has to sit there and he can get every single guy in there, while I don't get anybody. I know it sounds weird that I *want* guys to hit on me and try to pick me up with my boyfriend there, but I've just never had anybody pick me up before, and [I think I'm a pretty decent looking guy](http://i.imgur.com/8MEQ9Y8.jpg).

As the title reads, I am a submissive bottom, and I enjoy being dominated and, of course, fucked.

The sensation however is not as pleasurable as some have described. I've read posts of even straight guys going in for prostate exams and getting an instant boner upon penetration, and then an intense hands-free orgasm during the exam/massage. (Hot stories by the way)

But I'm not getting that. I can get hard from the initial play, but once I've been penetrated, I lose it. I can't keep the stiffy while bottoming and the sensation can sometimes not be super pleasurable. It seems like what I enjoy from bottoming is the gratification of pleasuring my top.

I've played with specially designed toys to massage my prostate and I can never get myself super stimulated from it or give myself an erection from it (while inside).

Am I alone here? Is it a gradual build up with practice? At the end of it all, how do I make bottoming more pleasurable for me (ultimately, in order to stay hard)? I just want to be a better bottom, for myself as well as my partner during sex.

Lets just say she can be loud in bed. The walls are thin at my apartment, but even if they weren't, she would still be easily heard.

Earlier, the three of us were hanging out at our apartment, and they say they are going to his room ""to listen to music."" Needless to say, they probably weren't paying attention to the music, and I could hear most of what was going on.

I guess I was just a little peeved that they knew I was leaving in less than an hour to go skiing for the rest of the day, but decided they couldn't wait. I wouldn't care if I couldn't hear, but I was already in the farthest room away, and could STILL hear her moaning.

My roommate and I complain about the people who have loud sex above us, so I know he is well aware that I can probably hear.

Do any of you talk to your roommates about this kind of stuff, or do you just let it go? 


TL;DR Roommate didn't wait to get jiggy with his loud girlfriend when they both knew I would be leaving the apartment in an hour. I don't much like listening females moaning in the throes of passion. I'd prefer not to talk about him sexing up his girlfriend, if possible, but maybe it's unavoidable, and not so awkward.

Am I wrong for finding it a bit rude that they can't wait just a few minutes for me to leave? And should I talk to him about it, or just let it go.

It's not the first time.

My name is Eric and I am a gaybro.

I feel like many of you out there probably have the same problems as I do and i've been asking friends etc on how to help but to be honest none of them can really help.

I'm cute (my mom told me so), i'm funny, i'm nice, all in all i'd do me. However what i'm not good at is attracting guys. 

Pretty much all of my friends are straight, and we go out to straight bars most of the time, which i am totally fine with. I have a blast. We've gone to a gay bar a couple of times and had good times there too. (btw im kinda shaking typing this cuz i dont know what to say really, im always the guy helping people but not knowing how to help himself). 

I feel like an idiot asking for help finding guys since i know its not something you just go out and do. But i feel like im doing something wrong. After asking all of my friends they've all come to the conclusion that its pretty hard to tell that im gay from the way that i act etc, hence the gaybroness. I feel like that may be part of the problem. I know im approachable since people always feel ok to talk to me or to ask me directions or to ask me to dance (girls mostly), but i dont think i even throw out a gay vibe to the possible man candies out there. 

I am doing and have done the grindr thing, as per usual its mostly fucked me over. Im on okc, but unfortunately for me i do feel like i need a certain attraction to the guys that tend to message me on there and so far that hasnt brought forth anything. They all seem to be super nice and some of them have shared interests etc with me, but just noone has jumped out. 

I live in chicago, just moved to Logan Square. I dress pretty normal, or so I think. I play a lot of video games, i love movies. I want what any gaybro wants. That husbro of my dreams. Im 22, and yes i know thats young but ive been through an awful lot in my life and just want the real thing. Not to mention the toughest part is being a straight acting bottom that wants an even straighter acting top (open for flipping time to time too :P). I just honestly am not sure what im doing wrong if anything. I guess i just need some advice/positive affirmation. 

Ask anything you think will help or if you just wanna know, im not ashamed of anything and am an open book.

Now, I'm in a relationship. My BF never ever had a gay experience before (dated/slept only with girls). We've been together 5 months now. And we have not had anal sex because we don't like it/don't know how to.

1376779816.0,12,self.askgaybros,1kkouy,I'm really lost.,A_Bewlay_Brother,14,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1kkouy/im_really_lost/,"I'm not sure what's wrong with me but it has been for a long while now, this isn't entirely to do with being gay but this community is one I feel will be the most understanding to what I have been through for the last 10 or so months. I'll try and be as chronological and not as rambly as possible. If you aren't interested in a wall of text I apologise in advance.

I started university in September 2012, coming from a small island with an almost non-existent gay community I was so excited to be moving to London, to finally be myself (not that I wasn't out but to have true freedom) and explore my sexuality, find myself and truly discover who I am as a person. Maybe even meet a guy to be with if that's not so much to want.

I was very nervous though moving to university, terrified even. I was scared what people may think of me and I wasn't sure as to how I should be to others. In the end I just tried to get on with anyone and everything, being polite and civil; friendly and pleasant and ultimately, in my eyes, a bore.

I was so crippled with nerves I was afraid to be myself in a way, I didn't know how people would react to me. Whether they'd think I was funny and nice or a loser to mock. I never hid my sexuality because I thought I was comfortable with it, but I'm not so sure now.

I've never really had a gay friend, of course I've met other gay people but we've either not had much in common or just haven't gotten on. As comfortable as many may be with themselves, for me I find this quite lonely, I don't have anyone I can just talk to about, to talk about guys I like and sex. It's tiring being a novelty for people, sure I can have a laugh about it but when I say ""Ah I hooked up with this guy last night"" and the first reaction from a friend is ""Ew"" it's not the most pleasant. It's not that they're homophobic or intolerant as bad as it may sound, but I think it's because they don't know how to react to it. On the other side, I've always been a bit self-depricating, one because it is a sense of humour and mockery, but on some level I think it just eases anxiety I have about my sexuality when the majority of people I know are straight.

So I was plodding through university, not quite sure how to just 'be' and feeling like I had nothing to say to anyone. Just feeling unimportant but polite. A nice guy with no substance. I pretty much ended up hating myself by November.

Now, I haven't been diagnosed or seeked councilling out of fear and demotivation, a sense of worthlessness and futility about everything. But I genuinely feel that from November to possibly as recent as July 2013 I suffered from depression. Constantly fearing what people thought of me, suffering excessively from anxiety and trying to second guess the comments of people and subtext that may or may not have been there.

I had lost myself.


Come Christmas, my sister comes over and we go to Soho. I had an awful time, in a dark place of introspection and self-doubt. It ended up in an awful argument that nearly ruined one of the best relationships I have in my life.

Although I never attempted suicide, I contemplated it almost daily. Staring from the edge of bridges down at the river, crying for no reason when I tried to resolve my issues with pen and paper out of sheer frustration. Attempting to confide in a friend and ending up saying ""I just don't know what I mean.""

I felt like I hit rock bottom, a point of true nothingness, pointlessness and self-loathing.

I couldn't even make it to university. I'd never be able to sleep and come dawn I'd sleep to wake up in the middle of the afternoon, struggling to see the point to get out of bed. I remember a while ago writing a post saying a bit of this but not to this extent on /r/gaybros and I was invited to a London gaybros event, although I appreciated the gesture I just didn't want to burden anyone and so never went to anything organised.

Although I somehow passed my assessed work (trust me, I have no idea how considering my attendance can't be more than 60%), I went to Australia to see where my mum and step-dad had recently moved. Coming up to the days of my departure from London toward the end of May I was telling people I had spent my year with ""Just wait until I'm back, you haven't really met me yet."" A self from the past filled with optimism and happiness, someone who could take a joke whether an awful pun or a dark joke. I believed that being with my family I could make it back to my sarcastic and friendly former, unfortunately that wasn't the case.

One evening I remember trying to talk about this with my mum, this feeling of futility, of expressionless and lack of personality. A shell of myself. Someone that felt like a burden on everyone, ranging from physical, emotional, social and financial. I said I wanted to see someone, thinking that I might have been suffering from depression. She replied with ""Well if you think you are a burden, how much do you think seeing someone to talk to would cost?""

I cried all night without a wink of sleep that night, devastated that my own family couldn't even provide a sense of peace for me. I felt trapped on the other side of the world finding nothing but disappointment and just more people to condescend and judge me. We tried talking on many occasions, but ultimately it deduced to arguments and rhetoric of ""How can you say you are depressed when you haven't been diagnosed?"" or ""Get over yourself, stop being such a child.""

Then, some people who I spoke to on my course invited me to live with them next year. I was ecstatic as I always felt they took pity on me in a way. I took the offer. 

I wasn't able to find work in Australia so I went home to live with my dad, who now lives in a bedsit.

I should have said before, even though my mum and stepdad have moved to Australia. My family are completely broke. Both my mum and dad who are separated. Struggling to make rent on both ends to having to quit smoking (I know, it's bad for you) because they cannot afford it.

I returned home and lucked out with a job to start trying to fend for myself. However coming back to find my dad in a bedsit I feel almost obliged to help him. Now, my relationship with my dad isn't great but it's not bad either. We love each other, but there's no relationship there, there never has been and unfortunately that's still there. We just can't speak to each other.

Since being home I feel the need to help him financially even though I am a student in debt. I feel like sometimes I care too much, both in caring for others and caring too much about what others think of me. I try so hard to be a good person and I just feel empty, just someone there in the background with no distinction or personality. A boring sod who burdens and dampens the fun and joy of a night out.

I go back next month to university, an experience that has utterly shattered my confidence. Although I feel much better now than I did say 2/3 months ago, I just feel bland now, I feel like I just can't contribute to any conversation whether serious or jovial. I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't know how to fix it. 

I'm really lost at the moment. Any advice or even understanding would be greatly appreciated. I just don't know how to go about day to day business anymore.

I think I was lucky enough to have a father and mother who, while un-accepting, never did anything beyond lectures and lessons on why being gay was horrible. Even so, there's still a part of me that really hates my parents.

Here's some background. I came out to them several the times over the course of high school. Each time there was a couple hour lecture on the perils of living the homosexual lifestyle. And how terrible the liberal media is for worming their way into the minds of the children to recruit them to the gay political agenda. My father always tried to back it up with psychological ""facts"" and origins of homosexuality. Stats and what not. According to what he tells my sister now, he was trying to keep me informed about the struggles I'd face. According to what I've experienced, gays make him uncomfortable and only looked up facts to back up his view.

My mother was more adamant about her hatred. She bonded once with her friend about how disgusting lesbians were. Every time I acquired a male friend her response was ""Well is he Gay? You shouldn't be friends with him if he is."" She told me I was making worse decisions than my sister at my age. My sister, at age 16 was heavy into drugs, partying, and had an abortion at one point. Three years ago, my mother ended up dying from cancer which left the gay thing essentially unresolved.

Ultimately, I think about it and there's a large part of me that hates my parents for it. I don't really trust my dad, and have no desire to share with him my personal life. I even tend to get annoyed at him when he talks to me too much, or tries to help me out with something and repeats himself. 

I always have worried that I won't be able to comfortably bring my boyfriend home to dinner or something, especially not to my dad's side of the family. But I went to my sister's with my boyfriend and he fit in wonderfully with my sister, brother-in-law, aunt and uncle. This kind of made me more disappointed/angry at my parents.

Soooo quite a few months ago (Mid March) I had a pretty bad spell of anxiety start, I didn't really masturbate at all. I'd get really anxious thinking about sex and stuff, anyway I started seeing a therapist for anxiety and panic attacks, I'm going to go back in August when school starts again. 

Anyway, I began feeling a lot better and eventually, sort of made myself masturbate - it took a while to get it up even if I used porn. I didn't get nearly as horny as I used to get (back in January/February, I was such a horndog). [It's important to note that I have been with a guy once - we jacked off thats about it and that was 2 yrs ago  (When I was a senior in high school) about to be a junior in college now.] I also had began taking Citalopram (it's an ssri), and I've noticed that when I masturbate, it's pretty much because I sort of make myself. Like I rarely ever ever get hard/horny at all ever - this makes me really worried because I don't wanna lose my sexuality, I can look at dudes and say ""oh yeah he's attractive, etc"" but it feels very different, almost as if I have no REAL sexual desire....I also think I suffer a bit of death grip from when I masturbate. I recently read an article about how SSRIs can make you lose sexual performance and keep you from ""falling in love"". I've been talking to some guys in the past few months (thru Tinder...I know it's just an online thing, I'm not expecting much from any of them) but I haven't had ANY desire to get to know any of them better at all - which is not how I've been in the past. I'm just sort of starting to come out sort of as a part of getting over my anxiety problems, all my friends are suuuuper supportive and don't care at all. But in the past, like even in January, this wasn't the case at all.  I also used to work out a TON in the past and was in super good shape in January/February, when I started having anxiety problems, I definitely ate A LOT less healthy and exercised A LOT less, and have definitely began to see myself as a little less attractive cuz of it haha so maybe that has something to do with it...

Sorry this is so long, but I guess I just need some advice on how to get back into being my own horny self, I feel like my sex/romance drive is broken, and I'm worried it's just gone. I also am not as socially active as I was before either...anyway just wondering if you guys had anything similar happen to you or had any advice!!! Thanks broskis!!

There's a bunch of issues for me to untangle, and I probably should be using a throwaway name here, but what the hell.

First, a bit about me.  I'm 30, single, and just recently coming to terms with my sexuality (within the last few years).  I'm just now moving back to my hometown to take a new job after seven years living in the middle of nowhere farm country.  I've got pretty high walls - I'm a bit of a loner, and probably kept it that way intentionally to avoid being outed, etc.  Eventually, it just kind of became habit.

While I'm working on my social life (slowly but surely), moving back to my hometown has temporarily forced me back in to my parents home until my own home sells (fuck you, depressed housing market).  

So, like any good Jewish mother, it's killing my mom that I'm not married with at least one kid and a white picket fence (compounded by the fact that my brother, who is three years younger than me, is already done with all of these things).  She's pressuring me to meet people and meet girls, but the problem is, obviously, that I don't want to.  I'd love to get out there and meet guys, and I'm trying to, but I really suck at it, and that's an issue for another thread.  Also, like any good Jewish mother, my mom is horribly judgy and closed-minded, and would definitely not understand, and would probably react in anger.  I had a friend growing up who ended up being gay, and every time my mom talks about him, she talks about how she doesn't know how his mother can deal with someone like that.  Also, about how it's a choice, and weird, and whatever, and it's so disgusting.  My dad is kind of a wildcard, he'll be a peacemaker, but he's not really a consideration either way.

I had planned to tell them this year, but I was planning on being far away, still in my own home when I did it.  Now that I'm here, I'm not really sure what to do.  The combination of lying (and fighting - because my singleness is the cause of many-a-fights in my home), and my otherwise social awkwardness is manifesting itself physically - I'm becoming depressed, lethargic, otherwise sickly.  A change needs to happen, but I'm not sure how.

I'm financially stable enough that I could afford to live in a lower-end apartment or share an apartment with someone if I had to while I waited for the sale of my house.  But it would tighten things for a while, and put me in a pretty precarious financial situation in an emergency.  But I'm not sure that I'm emotionally prepared to have this battle with my parents while I'm living here, and working through a new job.  I'm also not sure I'm emotionally or physically capable of letting this drag out.

Four years ago, I was 19, I was broken up with. He wasn't an amazing guy. In retrospect, I realize he was a decent guy who could be a bit of a jerk sometimes, but either way I fell for him hard. The relationship was never amazing after our honeymoon phase, and it didn't work out. The first year or so after, I thought I lost the best guy in the world, until my current understanding set in.

My heart's completely walled off now. The thought of dating triggers severe panic attacks. i let someone in, and he dealt a blow to me that left me reeling for years. My unconscious motive is to ensure that no one will get the chance to do that to me again. Two years ago, I was talking to this guy, and after two weeks I told him we couldn't interact anymore... because I would lay in bed crying at the thought of having to hang out with him or log on to Facebook and see a message from him. A year ago, I found a fuckbuddy. We fucked three times, no strings attached, and after each time, I walked around outside alone, for an hour, sobbing.

The thought of dating makes me cry, having sex makes me cry, everything involving a promising boy triggers major anxiety. I am so afraid of intimacy. I've learned to live in isolation. My problems, I work on and solve alone. I'm very very successful in other aspects of life, because I'm spending NO time on romance.

*In fact, about 90% of the porn I watch tries to convince me that the guys identify as straight and either (a) are just doing it for the money, (b) have always wondered about what it'd be like with a guy, or (c) are under the impression they'd be doing it with a girl and she didn't show up or that it'd be a solo scene*

My concern is I have no idea what to expect.

I would honestly appreciate it if you managed to read all of this.

A bit about me: I am 22 years old, I just moved back to Ottawa from Montreal. As you’ll probably gather from reading this post, I have a low self-esteem, and while I would hopefully say I’m attractive enough, you won’t be seeing me modelling on any magazine cover or billboard. I like to consider myself intelligent, I love reading, discussing and debating (arguing). I am very outspoken and opinionated. I love architecture and urban planning. I’m bilingual English-French, but I’ve learned Italian (my dad’s family is Italian) and as I enjoy language (I used to be crazy about them) I used to try to learn new ones all the time, like Japanese, Mandarin, Korean or German (there were others but you get the gist). I consider myself simple, I like to go for walks and explore, try new food, and while I can’t cook well, I love to attempt cooking. :P I would like to say I enjoy travel, but as I’ve never been able to afford to do it, I love reading about other countries and cultures. One day when I can afford it, I want to spend months at a time in many different countries (particularly Asia). I’m not athletic, but I’m starting to go to the gym because I want to get in shape and be healthy (I’m not big, but I do have a layer of fat that I want to get rid of). I’m not really confident of my body though, and I am hairy (being part Italian-Irish). As far as my interests go, I’m open to trying new things. I may not be a fan of sports, but if you ask me to play a match or something I’ll do it because I find it fun. I am really shy and awkward when I meet new people, but when I’m comfortable with you I am very open and friendly. I’m no longer involved with the queer community, as I don’t feel it’s such a great place anymore (long story), and I’ve never felt comfortable/ enjoyed clubbing. I’m not into drugs, and while I drink socially, I’d rather not as I don’t like the feeling of drunkenness. I’m not the most masculine, but I’m more neutral/ambiguous now. Overall, I feel like I’m a decent enough guy. But I’m having some problems, and that’s what I’m hoping you can help me with.

I’m sort of trying to start my life over (or so it feels like). I want to study architecture in school, so I’m enrolled in math, physics and art courses independently to learn and improve my abilities. I am reading tonnes of books on architecture, urban planning, design, construction. I intend to speak to professors and departments in colleges and universities. I am now a member of my neighbourhood’s zoning committee (we’re almost downtown, and are seeing an influx of highrise development, so we try to make sure that the neighbourhood benefits properly). I hope to work in construction sometime next year so I learn about construction methods and materials for architecture school. I’m trying to do things that are more adventurous and not what I would normally do (I’m going to do [Edgewalk]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KkK35y8MAA) next week, and one day I want to bungee jump, skydive, and climb Mount Fuji, despite my incredible acrophobia. I’m trying to improve everything in my life, but there are certain things that I just don’t know how to fix them, particularly my non-existent lovelife.

I came out at a very early age: 11; and from middle school all throughout high school I was active in my city’s queer community, even starting a GSA in my high school. I was relatively prominent, having done several things that got my nominated for an award. However, despite being an active member, no one ever seemed to want to be interested in me romantically (or few people were explicit). 

There was an LGBTTQ youth group in my city that I would attend every so often, but I never stayed for long because I felt out of place, uncomfortable. I am shy and awkward but always friendly; but once I get to know someone and am more comfortable I am able to be my real self with them, and made great friends. I would either sit in the lounge or kitchen area, and talk to whomever else would stay out there, usually a group of people that would eventually leave and do something else downtown. Now, this youth group was never a dating service, but you would often see people from the meetings have sex or start dating, and then eventually some new guy or girl would join and they’d be “off the market” shortly after. 

As my city is small, it was impossible to not know what the other people were up to. They were always having sex with someone we knew. This made me feel like an outsider. I never understood how they could date or have sex so much, or better yet at all. It was such a common thing for them, that they were truly nonchalant about it. I really wanted to have a boyfriend or even have sex, but it never happened for me. I felt like I was ugly, as though I was undesirable, that the only thing people could want from me is to be friends. And while having friends is never a bad thing, I wanted something more. I wanted someone who liked me; who found me to be attractive enough; fun enough; want to spend time with me; and despite all my faults, someone who thought I was special and worth it. 

I dated 3 guys when I was in high school, and all the relationships lasted under 2 months. One cheated on me twice, but I should have known better, as he was just in the process of coming out and he should have been given some space to explore his sexuality, rather than enter into a closed, monogamous relationship with someone who had been out for a long time. The second one was incredibly superficial (and not very bright), and he broke up with me because he did find me attractive any more and grew bored of me. It was hard dating him because he lived in foster care without a phone or computer, so I could hardly get in contact with him. The third suffered from depression, caused when he fell for his straight friend and could not get over him. He was a skater-bro, and at this time I was effeminate (not flamboyant, but you could definitely tell I was gay). He told me he normally didn’t like guys like me, but for some reason he did. It lasted only 2 months, but he was my most significant boyfriend. The thing is, it wasn’t a healthy relationship. Not that I want to blame his depression, as it’s something I have as well now, but he was always criticizing me and my interests, he would put me down for things I was proud of. I was very sex-positive, and while my sex-life wasn’t anything special, I was upfront about it. He thought I was a slut because of this, and he told me so, even though my sex-life is pathetic (in the past 10 years, I have had anal sex 5 times with only 2 guys, and I gave blowjobs to another 6 guys). Despite him complaining that we were having too much sex (we only had anal 4 times) and him putting me down, I decided not to break up with him because I felt like… well, I liked him and I wanted to make it work. He broke up with me, citing his feelings for his straight friend, that I was overly sexualized, and that with certain things I did I wasn’t helping his depression.

He was the last guy I ever dated, and that was 5 years ago.

Fast forward a bit. I graduated high school that year and moved to Toronto to attend UofT. I was very proud of this achievement, as I had worked really hard and got into a great school in a huge city. This was a boost to my self-esteem, as it meant to me that I was intelligent. Toronto has a huge queer community, as most of you know, and while I was there, I did not meet anyone (I met a guy in residence, but that’s a complicated issue that never came to fruition). I stopped being involved in the queer community, as I no longer felt it a welcoming environment because people were not always nice to me/ catty bitches, and I didn’t date or even have sex at all (I lived in res, and never got to take advantage of my new-found freedom and that room). I moved back home after that to work, and then transferred to McGill in Montreal. In the two years that I was there, I did not meet many guy men, and the few I did meet weren’t into me. Some were potential, but something happened where they just stopped talking to me, so that didn’t really help me feel good. 

To deal with my celibacy, I convinced myself that relationships and sex were unnecessary; that I would focus on school and work, and everything would be hunky-dory because all I need was to be intelligent and successful. But I became lonely, I wanted to spend time with someone. I wanted to love someone and even have sex with them. But not just sex – the most mind-blowing sex imaginable. The sort that no one would ever want to complain about, the sort that they would want to come back again and again for more because they actually enjoy it. The sort of sex that makes them proud and happy to be with me. It’s obviously a fantasy, as none of this is probably realistic, but I just want someone that I can make happy. I’m happy when I make other people happy.

Anyway, this is getting long so I’ll end it soon. 

My friends tried introducing me to some guys they know, but nothing good came of it. One guy I started to like, but I found out that he had just started dating someone a week prior and it was going well. When this happened, I fell into a deep depression that made me flunk out of school. It wasn’t because of him, but I just felt so incapable of continuing. I lost interest in my program, I wasn’t happy living in Montreal, I felt like I wasn’t smart or attractive. It seems like an overreaction to a simple rejection, but it wasn’t just a rejection for me. This was four years after high school, and the loneliness and undesirability that I felt when I was younger came back and made me realize that my life would not get better. People don’t see me as anything more than just a friend. And this pattern continues over and over and over again, I have probably 100 (not very close) friends because of this: they don’t see me romantically or sexually, but that I’m a “chill” guy they want to hang with. Just a few days ago, my friend tried to introduce me to a guy, and it happened again, which deepened my depression.

At this point, I don’t know what to do. I obviously have no diploma or proper career, I have no real adventures to share with people that would make me seem amazing and worldly (I’ve read a lot, if that counts). But worst of all, I am single and celibate not by choice for far too long, and I want to find someone. At my age, I should be meeting lots of people, hooking up and dating, as I’m practically at my peak. I’ve not had a real/ long-term relationship and considering my sexual relations were few and subpar, I worry that I’m never going to learn and improve, and be really good. Looking for someone either through friends or online hasn’t worked for me, but not searching and letting things happen hasn’t worked either. Those are just things people say to make others feel better. I don’t have Grindr (no smartphone), but as much as I’d like to have casual sex at some point, I don’t feel comfortable with that right now (my mother is Irish-Catholic, and while she allowed me to be raised atheist, because my dad is Buddhist, her beliefs regarding sex and relationships has made that a shameful thing). For now, I’d like to have something more than sex. I've never had sex with a girl, but I'm at a point where I would like to have sex with one if I had a chance because I feel it would be easier to find then men and would relieve some of my pent-up sexual frustration. 

What do you think? What am I doing wrong that makes people see me as only a friend and nothing more? (I realize that you haven’t met me in person and this might be subjective). For someone who doesn’t like clubbing, who no longer feels comfortable in the queer community and hasn’t had much luck with online dating, how do I meet people, date, and have sex like everyone else? How did you manage to meet your SO or past beaux?

**TL;DR** I recommend reading it to better understand, but being single and celibate for 5 years not by choice, want to date but have never had any luck, and it's made me depressed (but I'm being treated for it, and I don't let it impede my social life).

Now, you can probably imagine my surprise at the weird feeling in my brain regions when a friend of mine who lives in the same neighbourhood as my ex called me to let me know that he saw my ex being active on Grindr. After explaining that we were in fact no longer together and that I was fine, he apologised for jumping to conclusions and left me and my befuddled feels to myself.


The thing is, I'm not sure why this is bothering me. First of all, just because my ex is on Grindr doesn't mean that he's actively looking for hook-ups. And even if he is, since we're not together anymore, I'm not really allowed to care. Just because I'm not ready to jump back on the horse (or the cowboy) doesn't mean that he shouldn't be.

When I confront him I always feel bad afterwords as he gets upset but can not help but feel he has gotten very comfortable in the situation where he wants for nothing and never has to put his hand in his pocket. He has in the past tried to help out with cash but it usual is after a row and lasts for that month only.
The long and short of it is I feel very used, which has lead to me getting friendly with one of our friends who I have been chatting away with about this for a while and started to get to know each other better and he asked me out on a date not a hey mate you board lets grab a coffee, but I want to get to Know you and see If we have something going date. Which I wouldn't mind considering the rut my partner and I are in. Yet at the same time I am guilt tripping over if I should go for it or not as I would have to tell my partner and break off with him first as I just won't be able to go behind his back like that, and at the same time am worried if it is just a rut and we will get passed it and is it worth trying to mend our relationship again ?

 I am so lost I have no clue where to turn or how I should go about things, Please help guys.

Sorry for trowaway, but my bf knows my real username so...

But I have been together with my BF for 7 months. Things are wonderfull when we are together. But we are only together once every 2 or 3 weeks. We only live about 10 km from each other, but his excuse is that he is busy with school etc. He is also the kind of guy that don't really enjoy texting, so there can go weeks without contact. And frankly I can't take that. He also cheated on me atleast 1 time.

I have thought multiple times about ending it, but everytime he comes over I forget because it is so lovely when we are together. I have come to terms with, that those few days once or twice a month, does not make up for the 30 days where I either miss him, or is thinking about breaking up with him.

I don't want to be one of those guys that does it by texting. So how do you break up with someone in this situation?

Bonus info: He is my first BF. And I can't just cut all contact after the breakup, since he have borrowed for about 300$ worth of electronics from me.. Sorry for rambeling.

So I'm new here! Just finished sophomore year of colleg. Bout senior year of high school I told some of my close friends that I was gay (mostly cuz I had messed around with one of our already out friends and it felt right) and told myself I'd be (a little more) open in college. Long story short, I didn't at all, I got caught up in making friends and such that I sort of just forgot and then it felt too late. 



Anyways now I've a decent set of friends, most of which I would see as being accepting. I've had pretty bad problems with anxiety the past 2 months (I have obsessive compulsive disorder among other anxiety problems most of which haven't been a problem much until this year). So after seeing a counselor and whatnot I suppose I should really start figuring out my sexuality. I've been really interested in trying to meet people and have people to talk to (my close friends are away for the summer I'm at school alone till july, sad haha). The guy I did stuff with as I mentioned earlier and I aren't really friends, drifted apart, and I don't have any other gay friends. I basically hang out with a bunch of my frat bros and a few girls.



Soooooo how do I go about this whole thing? I worry about getting out to meet people and my friends hearing that I may be gay rather than me telling them and I honestly worry about my own acceptance of my sexuality as well. I am worried that I'm not ready for being open or I will regret it. Ah I have so many thoughts I just can't figure it all out! Thanks guys!

I know this is a really basic question, but I want to solicite opinions.  I've been seeing this guy for a few months now – chatted and hung out a bit in November and December, and started to become really close in January/February.  I have really strong feelings for him beyond mere horny-ness and lust.  He's about to head out for a job that will see us physically apart for most of the summer.  I'm not scared of this, because I think we communicate well and are used to living about 30-45 minutes apart. Not to mention, we've been expecting this since the beginning.

Anyway, I think I want to tell him that I love him.  I've come very close at times, but I'm really afraid of scaring him.  I don't know why he'd be scared, but I don't want to make him uncomfortable.

So I guess my question is, when did you tell your love that you loved them? How many months into the relationship?  And is 5/6 months too soon?

But in all seriousness here is the situation and why I need some guidance.  
The backstory:  I have been with my bf for a year and a half.  We have a close relationship and (I think) great communication (for the most part).  We have had minor ups and downs.  And one MAJOR set-back.  Last summer we were having a great relationship.  Taking vacations, hiking, climbing mountains, playing tennis, just all-in-all spending a lot of quality time together.  I was on the cusp of telling him I love him.  We were on top of a mountain having climbed it all day when he told me he loves me.  I didn't respond.  I didn't want to be cliche and say it back and make it seem less important.  So I didn't say it back.  A few days later we were hanging out the night before he was living town for the night.  The whole night it was on the tip of my tongue to say it to him.  Looking into his eyes repeatedly, looking away as I backed down from saying it.  He went away for the night without me saying it.  When he got back we met up that day.  I went to kiss him and noticed a hickey on his neck.  We were at a mall.  I walked away from him - my heart was pounding in my eyes and I couldn't focus.  I KNEW it was a hickey and it was making me immediately sick to my stomach.  Long story short, while away for the night he got drunk and had sex with some random friend of a friend.  He regretted it (or regretted getting caught) and after a lengthy and messy it we got through it.  But it was all him trying and me not wanting to see him.  Eventually he said he was scared because I had never told him I loved him back and he just wanted to feel something from someone else.  I think its an excuse and a cop-out to blame me for his cheating.  
Since then we have built our relationship back up.  Its been hard work.  How one 20 min action can have such a lasting impact  over so much quality time together seems ridiculous at times, and also makes sense at the same time.  
Recently we've been watching porn together or making comment on hot guys and the idea of a threesome has come up.  We've both said how it would be hot to have one and what would be hot about, etc.  
What is a genuine worry for me, is that we aren't stable enough to have one because of the cheating.  And the experience may bring up feelings I went through when the cheating happened.  
Recently we had a heated argument and somehow or other a comment was made along the lines of me being with someone else and how he wouldn't appreciate that.  And his response was that he wouldn't be bothered if I cheated.  That one statement opened a can of worms and we discussed our views.  I told him I could never give him an open relationship and he said that he wouldn't want to be with anyone else, but if I was with someone else it wouldn't bother him, and he would only be with someone else if I were there and it was a threesome.
Now I think I'm pretty level headed and think things through and am open minded.  The idea of a threesome with him seems like it could be fun and we would both enjoy it (we've both had them in previous situations), but now with the cheating the revelations of the heated conversation I just don't think having a threesome would be a wise choice for us.  
Has anyone experienced these situations before or have some insight or prospective that I might be missing?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 
Cheers

I just need some advice, feeling lonely and pretty low recently and this gaybros feed makes me feel better for some reason.

So I just got out of my first relationship (2 years) with a great guy, I think we can all attest to the fact that it is HARD as FUCk to find some one who A. is masc B. fits your idea of attractive C. can mesh into your lifestyle (Friends, family things) the list could go on -
Anyway after 23 years of watching my straight friends find people, date people, leave people and basically just living life while i sat around and waited for mine to start, I live just north of NYC about 30-40 mins, and in the suberbs you have 2 kinds of guys, the obviously gay and flamboyant ones, and married/daddy men. I like fem boys its just that my dick wont get hard for them, I am by definition a vers btm and masc, so I have spent my life hoping to find someone, wanting to know what its like to have a boyfriend and when i met ryan, the term head over heals seems like a fraction of what i really felt for him, he was hott, masculine, liked the yankees and rolled a great blunt, we dated for 2 years.
 
He was a strict top, and I didnt hate that, actually It worked perfectly for me, he liked to hold the door for me, drive the car and do somewhat more manlier things although I am not fem I did gravitate to the more subordinate in the relationship. I am and was already much more comfortable with my ""outness"" than him (which I think is due to the liberal town and great group of guys i call my best friends) although he wasnt ""closeted"" he was still dealing and learning a ton about being himself. He always had said things like ""the beginning  to the rest of my life started with you"" ""we have the most amazing sex"" and we did, im talking passionate, sweaty just awesome sex where he was a top, he never had an issue getting hard and staying hard"" we would fall asleep in each others arms, it was exactly what I had been waiting for my whole life.

Ill get to the point - One day we are on the phone, I was with him earlier and called as i was brushing my teeth to say goodnight when i heard a noise through the phone - it wasnt just any noise - it was the notification noise from either adam4adam or manhunt - not sure but neither of those are the site he was using to look for a one bedroom apt for us. I reacted strongly and the next day we had a ""talk"" I loved him so much that his story that he ""just likes to look"" was enough to convince me. Anyway I asked him to see the confirmation email that he had canceled his profile on the gay meet up site. He sends me his login and pw, the inbox had about 8 months worth of missing emails, and the trash had been completely wiped, there was things in there from craigslist and what not all dated 2010 - 2011 , not a big deal, till i realized he had forgotten to delete the sent folder.

what I found has destroyed me, he was out meeting up with MULTIPLE people Multiple times places and everything, he even worked at New York Sports Clubs (a gym) and was meeting men in the sauna after his shifts. In every encounter that I read, he was a bottom, one guy wrote him and said ""I hope your not some little breakable boy, I am a bigger man in every way"" - he responded ""awesome see you at 330 in the sauna"" I even read one encounter where he got fucked by a guy, the email was dated FEB 15th the day after we spent the best day of my life together...a day called valentines day, that I have always hated, loathed even, I used to think i would never enjoy that day, i would forever get a card from my mom and some candy...until i met ryan and my whole outlook on valentines day changed, well momentarily since i again HATE valentines day...

This KILLED ME, Im actually tearing up writing this - anyway I wish i could say i left him but i didnt, I dont know if im crazy or what but I was so in love with him and us and what we had i didnt want to go back to my lonely life of me myself and I, I stayed with him a couple more months, they were hard I started having night mares and we were fighting all the time not to mention more lies had surfaced. As of April 2013 I am single, Im devastated im never going to find someone, i will be alone for a good amount of time, and it just makes me think, can i be mad at him, as someone who is more comfortable with them selves and knows exactly what I want, can I be mad at someone who is still figuring it out?

Im really sorry for the length of this one guys, tear me apart, do as you please but how can someone just do that? Mulitple times! oh and he got fired from nysc I supported him on my lowly junior account executive salary, while he spent his days meeting up with dudes. Im broke, broken, and all around just unmotivated, depressed and questioning the entity of human life. he still begs me to come back... what do you guys think? Was I just a science experiment for him, his first dip into the man pond or what? can someone change? can someones fantasies be supressed? and more importantly - How can we really forgive if we cant forget?

I'm 19 and he's turning 25. Things were pretty good in the beginning and he would occasionally spoil me since I'm a poor college student and he has a full time job as a teacher. Everything was great until we got together when I starting noticing his temper tantrums and clingyness. I've had a few boyfriends and being a quiet introvert I have NEVER got into fights. However with him we would fight about the smallest things, (me not apologizing cause the signal was bad on the phone) or one time when he got no texts or worried messages from me when his phone died for an hour. 

Since then we've had many many fights some of which I said I wanted to breakup, right when I do he becomes a completely different person saying how much he needs me how happy I make him feel, how lonely he is ( he works 2 hours away and lives there and we see each other every weekend). I do still deeply care about him and his well being but I just don't think I can take the pressure and responsibilities of being his boyfriend anymore. I literally have no time to myself since he pretty much has no life, he just goes to work goes home afterwards(he has no friends there) I'm pretty much skyping with him all day long whenever I'm not at school or with my friends ( which I rarely are with now because last time he got pissed at me cause I chose to spend time with then rather than with him)

I have expressed a couple times to him that I was not happy and he just said ""we'll work on it"" personally I just dont want to work anymore, I dont think that I should have to work this hard to be happy in a relationship. I just don't know how to bring it up when we're not fighting and how to just ends things cause he will just want to ""work it out""

I was incredibly nervous when we first met, mostly because I had never been with anyone seriously, and he had an extensive history that co-workers had warned me about. But he seemed sweet enough, we hit it off, and made it happen. 

It became very serious, very quickly. We had a small rough patch where we separated for a very brief period because of some communication issues, but we talked those out and proceeded to move in together briefly afterwards. Things were going very, very well. He got a promotion, we lived a very happy life. 

About a year later I suddenly got the chance to move to the big city for my career. It was the only decision to make, since my career was JUST starting and there was no where else to go at the job I was in. We both recognized it as the best decision for me and so, in the summer, I decided to move to the city, 1.5 hours away from him. We continued our relationship long distance, which was okay, but tough for a while.

Long distance became a major issue when the fall season kicked in because that started both of our seriously busy seasons. You see, we both work completely opposite schedules. I work 6 days a week, Tu-Sun with only Mon off, and usually either 9am - 7/8pm or 4pm-10/11pm, and he works a over-booked M-F 9am-5pm (usually actually getting out at 7:30 or 8). 

Seeing each other was almost impossible. I'd go weeks without seeing him and never know when the next time we'd see each other was. We still stayed in CONSTANT contact through text message (like 12 year old girls) which was okay. And occasionally he'd pop down for a night or I'd go up for a night, we'd go to dinner, come home and cuddle or what-have-you, and it was lovely.

Soon though, it began to wear. I started getting really depressed. I had no friends in the city, and my behavior and inclinations weren't allowing me to have friends. I never went out. I always felt a little guilty going out without him, even though he wasn't around. I felt like I just wanted to go home to him, but this caused me to shut myself in constantly. It was an awful feeling. Soon I started to resent him popping in for an evening after I got off work. We'd get three hours with each other, and go to bed because he'd need to head back early, or I'd have to go to work early. I wanted more time than was possible. It only served to make me feel worse.

What was worse was we had no timeline. No ""In a year we'll be back together! For now, we're roughing it."" There was nothing. There was no end to long-distance in the foreseeable future. 

Then suddenly I befriended a co-worker who FORCED me to go out. She had seen me in this pit, had been familiar with the pit, and refused to let me wallow in it. I made friends with her friends and we hung out almost nightly. I was suddenly young and social again and it felt great. 

That's when the feeling of wanting more hit me. It was like meeting these people had opened my eyes to the idea that there were more guys to meet. Here I was, 25 years old, for the first time in NEW YORK CITY, with the ability to meet so many guys, and instead I was nursing an aching heart that was resting 1.5 hours away from me. I don't know what else I wanted, but I wanted more. I've dated one person in my adult life, him, where he's dated 4 or 5. It seemed like I was missing something. We are in two different places in our lives.

So here I am, working in the city he lives in temporarily and staying with him. We've spoken about this and he has stressed to me that he thinks I'm worth it. He wants to make it work. We had no timeline before, but now he says ""2 years and maybe I'll move."" But I don't know if I can do 2 years. And I told him that. 

I love him more than you can imagine. He's one of the most amazing people I know. But I know that this ache for recklessness and freedom will be there forever if I don't fulfill it. I feel like I'll head straight back into that depression if I do this distance for another two years. I can't do that. So my relationship is slowly but surely falling apart in front of me and I'm terrified.

Am I the only one dealing with this?,Kitten_Wizard,16,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1crbuw/is_this_weird_or_unhealthy_am_i_the_only_one/,"Firstly this doesn't have to do with the subreddit's name, nothing to do with masculinity versus femininity, and none of the political shit that I've seen on /r/gaybros about identifying as a bro without being a ""true bro"" as some are saying. Please take this as asking for help on ways to guide myself through my fear barriers to become to person I want to be and feel I am inside.

Excuse the wall of text, formatting, and any mistakes.

----------

I want to be the ""athletic bro"" type of guy. I feel so uncomfortable NOT being that and feel like I have been shoving this personality of mine behind barriers of fear and being crushed by the fears. I just have a social pull toward these types of people. I will be the first to say I do have a romantic attraction to the ""athletic bro"" types but this isn't some lust driven scheme to hook up with these types of guys. I am also aware of an emerging trend that the ""str8 acting"" guys are ""hot"" but this honestly has nothing to do with my feelings. I have always felt this social pull. Way back in grade school when I had no idea what homosexuality was, let alone identified as it, I always had this feeling like ""I want to get to know him, be his friend, and have such an awesome person in my life!"" For a young kid this is a pretty foreign feeling and I had no words to describe how I was feeling. I just knew I wanted to be friends with those types but thought I wouldn't fit in at all so I kept my distance and suffered from the inner conflict. I guess I want to be apart of this group that I have always felt a pull toward but thought I wasn't apart of.

I have always had bad self esteem about myself. Maybe I have always wanted to have specific interests/characteristics (into sports, athletic, outgoing, confident, open to talk to) but felt that I wasn't able to be the person I wanted to be. It’s weird to explain because if a kid is interested in a sport/activity/whatever they usually just go do it and don’t become consumed by how they feel others will judge them, how they expect the situation to play out, how they expect to perform, and the following self judgement of the whole situation. I never had the confidence to join sports and always felt like my performance in the sport meant that everyone was going to dislike me, talk about how shit I am, and basically just want me off the field so the real players can have fun. I guess this is social anxiety? Even at such a young age? I remember being dropped off at middle school and being so emotional and crying that I had to go to the nurse quite often to calm down. My parents have stories of the same shit happening even from the first day of kindergarten. I even have anxiety issues to this day so I guess those were panic attacks as a kid. I guess to cope with these feelings I became a loner of sorts - not really engaging in social events, keeping my distance from most people in fear they would find out how uninteresting, awkward, and ""shitty"" of a person I am. This basically made me feel like shit and truly unhappy all my life. I feel like my whole life has been some fucked up coping mechanism because of my fear as a child which grew and became even worse as I became an adult.

I like the bonding and camaraderie of sports but find that my anxiety about performance and external/internal judgment leads me to staying away from them. Even just the thought of throwing a ball around between friends sounds like a performance test that I will 100% fail and look like a fool. That thought even spirals into that friend starting to distance themselves from me and realizing I am not someone they want to pal around with. I don't judge others the way I feel/think they judge me so it doesn't even make sense why I always feel this way. It's a frustrating and suffocating feeling when all I want to do is be carefree and join in on the fun while at the same time being utterly crippled by the fear of the situation.

Just recently I hit a real low and had a sort of mental shift. Why should I have this pit in my chest - a feeling of longing for something I can’t accomplish. Why should I hate myself for not being able to do what I want to do. Why should I feel like a failure as a human being, as an individual, for taking my wants and goals, and shoving them into a box labeled “Never going to accomplish but lets feel soul shattering emptiness about it.”

Now I am in a way taking this on as a self development. I want myself to get into sports, get athletic, get more sociable, and be that guy everyone likes to have around. I finally feel motivated and driven to be who I want to be. I am kinda worried that people are going to think i'm a fake guy trying to slither his way into the locker room to catch some naked guys showering. Although I find ""athletic bros"" attractive, seeing some naked guys is FAR from what i’m trying to accomplish. 

**I want to change my “current self” and I want to be one of the ""athletic bros"" I have always wanted to be.**

(Relationship Story),NickiTheNinja,16,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1c47bv/im_24_and_i_havent_had_sex_in_5_years/,"I'm not sure where to begin and I don't really have any of this organized, but I'm dying to tell this story.

In May 2006, I was 17 and like most people my age, I had a Myspace profile. I was commenting on a friend's profile when I saw a picture of this guy I found very attractive. He was about 5'8'', light brown complexion, in good shape. He seemed like that straight guy that's probably a jerk around his friends, but a completely nice guy when it's just you and him. For lack of a better discription, he looks A LOT like the rapper Drake. I checked his page and saw that he lived in an area in NYC that was very close to my high school, so I added him. He accepted the friend request later that day, but didn't say anything. I didn't say anything either. To be honest, I was happy just to be able to see the rest of his pictures XD.

About a week later, he sends me a message titled ""Do I know you?"" The text was pretty much what the title said with some additional stuff I can't remember, but it seemed cold, almost like he was bothered by my friend request. So I responded with something like ""I thought you were someone I knew, but I guess not. sry."" At that point I'd given up on trying to talk to him. I figured he was just straight or completely not interested. Then about 2 days later, he replied with ""o ok, well i hope that's not all wanted talk about."" Looking at it now I find that message a bit awkward, but at the time I was just over the moon with excitement. This guy was outrageously good-looking and just my type.

Over the next few months, we've gotten to know each other pretty well (or about as well as u can over the internet) and I've learned a few things about him. He considered himself ""bi-curious"" at the time which was fine with me because I was not ""out"" yet. (god, i hate that term &lt;_&lt; ) We talked about things like having to deal with family and friends, and not wanting to be looked at differently, etc. But I actually had a good number of friends I could talk to about my issues while he genuinely seemed to have none. Only superficial high school friends that would probably talk about him behind his back. I like being the one he could vent to. Gave us a lot to talk about.

Anyway, Sept. 2006 roles around and I've started my freshman year at NYU which was even closer to where he lived, and we decided meet for the first time. This would be not only my first date, but potentially my first boyfriend ever. I had no idea what to do or what was expected of me. But being older and way more financially set than he was, I just felt compelled to be the ""alpha"" I guess. I would pay for everything and just do everything that is expected of the guy when straight people are dating. I didn't know how he would take it being that he was more masculine like myself, but I was hoping he wouldn't mind :P

We'd planned to spend the day together. I took the subway to get to his place where I waited at a Starbucks for him to meet me. I was sitting down for 3 minutes before he showed up. I stood up as he was opening the door and just like in a movie, it was like he was the only one there. I smiled REALLY hard, and so did he. We walked toward each other slowed and just gave each other a big hug. It's weird because even though this was our first time meeting, it was one of those ""OMG Karen, I haven't seen you in FOREVERRRRRRR"" hugs. We didn't even seem to care that we weren't ""out"" either, we were just so happy to finally meet. We talked, and got some drinks before leaving the Starbucks. We walked down the pier for a bit (Near the West Side Highway for those familiar with NYC) while talking. Then we took a cab to Times Square where we did just about everything. We went to the ESPN Zone, Broadway City Arcade, Lazer Park, Yankee's Clubhouse, The Toys 'r' Us with the Ferris Wheel, we even made it over to Rockefeller Center and visited Nintendo world. Throughout the course of the date things just seemed to get better and better. He was funny, cute, and relatively smart for someone in high school :P.

We finished up our date the traditional way with dinner and a movie. We went to see Step Up. It was literally the best choice at the time, but we actually enjoyed it. We took a cab back to his place where I walked him to the front of his building and we said goodnight. I noticed he looked right and left first, so I kinda new it was coming, but we kissed. Nothing gross and tacky, but a nice 4-5 second kiss. Then he looked a me and smiled, and went inside his building. The moment he closed that door, I knew I was in love with him. He was no longer just an avatar on the internet, but the physical manifestation of everything I wanted.

We made it official after the next few dates and he even moved in with me at my on campus apartment when things got bad at his place. It wasn't under the best circumstances, but I was glad to have him there either way. He was a great distraction from the stress of school work, and I genuinely loved being around him all the time. It was also great because he and I were basically sex addicts. In the morning, when I got back from class/work, in the shower, before dinner, after dinner. ALL. THE. TIME. I was completely unreachable on the weekends. This was the best time of my life and I was glad I could be there for him when he needed it. I supported him, and even helped out his Mom when they were facing eviction. I literally would have done anything to keep him happy.

So Fast forward two years, the relationship is going pretty well. He's in college now and also dorms there (In Brooklyn, NY). I was a bit sad to see him go, but I also understood that he just wanted to experience ""dorm life"" for a bit. It became pretty hard to reach him and sometimes I wouldn't even hear from him til the next day. The weekend came and he showed up to my place (He still had a key of course) and we got into a big fight. I raged about him ""ignoring"" me and he responded with how he didn't think it was that big a deal. The argument escalated and I said some things I never should have. I made him feel really small as a person, and he left my apartment on the verge of tears. When he closed the door behind him, I knew the severity of what I've done. My pride wouldn't let me chase after him. I called him several times over the next couple of days. Leaving voicemails. Apologizing. He never answered. I went visit him at his dorm on Tuesday morning hoping that I could talk to him before class. I was ready to beg, crawl, whatever I had to do to keep him. I met him as he was leaving his building and asked if I could talk to him for a moment. He listened, but it was clear his mind was made up. He pretty much just said ""thank you for apologizing.. but I'm done."" I was stunned. I knew it was coming, but I still wasn't prepared to hear that. I looked away for a moment, looked back at him, nodded and said ""ok."" I walked off with a pretty blank expression. I went straight home skipping class and work that day. The entire day had this lump in my throat that would not go away. I wanted to cry so badly. But I never did. I just replayed all of the amazing memories over and over and over again in my head. And thinking about how I'll never have them again. I can't even think of the appropriate word to describe how miserable I was. I'd fallen out of contact with my ""good high school friends"" after the whole moving on from HS, deleting Myspace, changing my phone number chapter was over. My only friends now were college friends, people I play video games with competitively and co-workers. None of which knew I was gay and I would NEVER bring personal drama to work. EVER. I had no one to talk to.

Over the next couple of days. I went to class and work as per usual. But After work, I went hanging around bars like some weirdo looking to hook up with any guy I was mildly attracted to. I despise bars since they're usually crawling with drunken people. I don't drink alcohol and some people just go to far. But I was 20 at the time and could not get in to the bar, So I just waited outside. 6 nights in a row, I'd bring some guy back up to my place and just fuck his brains out. I had a lot of anger and frustration to get out. The first five guys just fucked and left. No questions. It was with the 6th guy that noticed I had a picture of my ex and I as my screensaver. He mentioned it after sex though I know he saw it before that. I told him it's a long story, but that we're through. He wanted to know what happened and although it would have been an excellent chance to talk to someone about it, I just didn't have the energy to relive everything in that moment. I just said that's a story for another time, put my arm around him and we went to sleep. It felt nice to have someone sleep in my bed again. That morning, I hope up before the other guy in my bed did. I didn't want to wake him up and kick him out. That's not my style and quite frankly, any company was better than no company. He woke up as I was making breakfast. We ate and talked a little. He said ""My name's Bryan by the way"" as he sat down at his plate. We both laughed and I told him my name as well. He asked if he could take a shower before leaving to which I replied ""sure."" He took a shower and as he was leaving, he gave me his phone number. Said I should call if I wanted to talk. After closing the door behind him, it hit me that I was left alone with my thoughts again. I spent the entire day thinking of my ex. I knew it would only make me sad, but I wanted to be sad. I was looking through my desk to clean out some junk and I ended up finding the movie ticket stubs from our first date. I kept them and put them in wallet. I never wanted to forget that day.

Months went by and I've literally thought about him at least once everyday. It wasn't til about a year and half later that I would have lapses in days where I thought about him. And yes I would actually think ""I don't remember thinking about him yesterday.. .. hmm."" 5 years later, I still thought about him occasionally but didn't miss him quite as badly as the first few years. It wasn't until I went to a video game convention with some friends in Boston, MA called PAX East. It was a 3 day event with literally THOUSANDS of people. But of all people, I NEVER expected to run into him. I was checking out the Marvel booth and as I was turning around to go somewhere else, both of our eyes meet. Just like when he opened the door to that Starbucks. I wasn't sure for a moment. He looked a bit different, let his hair grow out and had gotten taller. But then he smiled just like I remembered and I smiled back. It was kind of a tired smile, but I was actually pretty tired, and shocked as hell. He asked how I was doing, and gave me a hug. Maybe time did some healing because this was not the reunion I would have ever imagined. He seemed genuinely happy to see me and even a little flirty. (He felt my abs XD) We talked a bit about the event and caught up a little. He was with friends and I could tell they were trying to get to another booth. So we split and I got on the next shuttle back to my hotel.

PAX East was Mar. 27th, 2013 and I've thought about him every. single. day. since. All of my old memories came back. I miss him more than ever. I found him on Facebook but I didn't add him. I guess you could say I'm stalking him. From what I can tell, he's currently single. Obviously the thought has crossed my mind to contact him. But I don't want to go through a depression like in 2008. This guy has such an effect on me, I don't even know how. I'm actually very emotionless about pretty much everything. But not when it comes to him. I always thought high school boyfriends were supposed to stay just that. But he's changed me in so many ways. I used to be so outgoing, and confident. Now I really don't give anyone the time of day. I've had guys hit on me, and sometimes even hit on some guys as well. I never went through with anything. The last person I've been with is Bryan. Btw, I called him a few weeks later to hang out. We're really good friends now :) We haven't done anything since that first night though.

Anyway, that's my story. I've never told anyone until today. I will always regret what I've done. I don't know how long it's going to take before I get over this mental block but I've taken a few lessons from this. I will never become that obsessed person again. The kind of person who throws away a good relationship because you didn't promptly return my call. I didn't even know I had that in me.. but never again. I've since become a very calm person and I haven't blown up like I did since our fight. Til this day, I still have those movie tickets in my wallet. They serve as a constant reminder of the mistakes I will never make again, and someone I will always love.

We actually did watch a movie completely, and then, instead of watching another one, we talked for like 2 hours. He's like a very very good guy and it was really nice. Then, came the time where he asked me if I wanted to stay for the night, because my last bus was in like 10 minutes (time went really fast). So I said yes.

So we went to bed. And he asked me if it was the first time that I was  in the same bed with a guy and I shyly said yes. But he knows that I'm a virgin and stuff.

He then asked me if I wanted to cuddle and I said yes. My heart was beating so fast you have no idea. I tried to relax but I was just so excited. I mean, come on, after all these years of sleeping alone I was in the arms of a guy, try to imagine how I felt.

And still, my heart was pounding like crazy.......and I began to feel something in my back...he was getting hard, and you know was moving his body. I thought I would die of a heart attack. Okay, yes I didn't come to his place for the dick, but I mean, I really was excited, like a good excited.

And then....we kissed, and oh my god, I can't believe it but I sucked him and he sucked me. But my mind was so out of control that I couldn't get hard.

The next morning we barely talked, it was really early I must say and he had to go to work and also had to go very early. So I just said, well, see you later! And he said yes. We texted for a few minutes, he said he was sorry because I didn't come to basically have sex, but I said it was okay. 

I really want to see him again to complete what we did not complete, I didn't get to really text him today because he was working and I was working.

While I can say ""I am gay"" I cannot come to terms with it.
But Back to the question, I ask because I think I realized a large block that's keeping me from realizing my sexuality. I have tried looking at the stereotypical ""hot guy pictures"" (without being explicitly pornographic) and trying to judge my own reaction. Only on rare occasions do I find an instant attractiveness. This leads me to the conclusion that maybe I'm not gay. I mean sure, if Beckham dropped his pants I would be turned on, but just a picture from stomach up is just ""interesting"". I think I'm perpetuating the ""if I'm gay, then I would be dry humping any guy with a six pack"" mentality, which is obviously not true. 
So did any of you guys ever go through a similar thought process? Sorry if I'm not being clear, but its hard describing a feeling a hardly understand.

I have some straight friends that I go out to the bars on weekends with, and that's totally fun; I never feel self-conscious, because I'm with a group of straight people in a straight bar.

Where it falls apart, though, is when I deal with these two guys who could more legitimately be called bros. One was on our university's swim team, and we've had lots of classes together. He's a hunk, and he's nice to me. He's also really huggy, especially when he's drunk.

The other one is a guy who I have only had one class with, and who is even hotter. He's an actual frat bro, but without all the attitude. He's really sweet and always says hi to me in the hallway, knows Japanese, takes graduate-level classes as an undergraduate, and has a chest you could bounce a quarter off of.

I've actually hung out and played beer pong with the first guy, and stuff like that. With the second guy, I've only really chatted with him a few times. In both cases, neither guy has ever made a big deal about me being gay, but I always feel very self-conscious about it when I'm around them. I'm attracted to them immensely, but I know they're straight, so I don't want to accidentally hit on them. Especially with the first one, I like getting to do normal bro stuff like play beer pong and get drunk, because he doesn't care that I'm kind of a nerd.

My question is, how do you get over crushes on your straight bros? How do you invite them to hang out without it seeming like an attempt at seducing them? How do you turn off your sub-conscious flirting mechanisms?

Is there any way to overcome this?

1363698292.0,10,self.askgaybros,1al98t,BF wants open relationship - I'm traveling soon,idontreallyknowwhy,17,7,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1al98t/bf_wants_open_relationship_im_traveling_soon/,"
TL;DR – New relationship. BF wants it to be open. I'm traveling for two weeks. Not really sure how I feel. Looking for advice on how to make it work without getting hurt myself down the line.

So I've been seeing this guy for the better part of two months. We are in a really young relationship that's honestly been going great. Except for one thing that's been sort of in the background since the 2nd or 3rd date. 

He made it pretty clear that he is pretty sexually charged and really thinks he needs to be with a variety of partners to feel satisfied. At the time we sort of deferred the conversation since it was really early on in the relationship. We have had a pretty accelerated and awesome two months. We have sex about five or six times a week and spend a lot of great time doing various things outside of the bedroom.

Fast forward to now – I'm going to be out of the country for two weeks starting this weekend. 

Laying in bed last night he asks me how I would feel about an open relationship. Specifically, occasionally having ""meaningless-sex"" with safe partners. (Read: People he knows specifically for this purpose.) It appears to be a variety thing for him and all his prior relationships were open. In-fact, his last relationship, he never had sex with his BF of two years. Apparently they just weren't compatible and he was fine with that. 

Our situation is a little different (or so he says) in that we honestly have really good sex. Really compatible, we change things up and no two nights have been the same so far. He says he has been satisfied (even before we had this conversation.) However, its now going to be two weeks w/o any sex.  

Thing is – I'm not really sure how I feel about the situation. Mentally I feel like I should be upset – raised and always had mono relationships - but - I guess I would be okay with it, part of me thinks I would be more okay with it if I really didn't know any details. 

I think I'm more bothered by his phrasing than anything else. He basically summed it up as - ""I just don't understand why you wouldn't be okay with it. It's just sex and I want to be in a relationship with you. However if you feel strongly, I want to be in a relationship with you so I'll make it work."" That makes me feel like I'm the obstacle in the way of him being fully happy and satisfied. 

The thing is – I really like the guy and I would frankly be okay with letting him do it. My fear is, I really don't know how I would react, and I don't want to ruin the start of a good relationship because I later feel strange about the situation.  Honestly its two weeks and I almost feel like he seems like he would like *the option* to have sex without me. More like a freedom thing that as long as it's there he is satisfied. I just don't know.

Anyone go from solely monogamous relationships into open ones? How did you make it work (obviously a lot of communication, but what if I don't want to know?)

1363448647.0,12,self.askgaybros,1aeuyx,I need some help figuring something out about my childhood. long post ahead.,lekdatank,14,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1aeuyx/i_need_some_help_figuring_something_out_about_my/,"I really need help to figure out what exactly happen to me so I can move on with my life. thanks in advance for reading and commenting. I guess I should start with some background information. I was the 2nd of 4 boys born to Indo (India Hindu) Caribbean parents. We immigrated to the US in the early 80s. I was the forgotten middle child (my youngest brother is 8 years younger than me; there is 1.5 years between my other 2 brothers), so I tended to act out and misbehave, a lot, to get the attention of my parents. I was born in late September and I was under the school start age. Hence I was older than all the kids around me.

I was 7 or 8 when I discover jerking-off on my own. On the way to school there was a bakery. One day while my mom was walking us and she was talking to my brother, a lady came out of the bakery and winked and blew a kiss at me. She was the hottest lady that I have ever seen. It was the first time I felt the feeling of lust towards anyone. Later at night, while I was thinking of her, my penis got hard. I was exploring my penis, wondering why it was hard, which led to my discovering jerking-off. It’s great when your younger cause nothing comes out and there is nothing to clean up. You just have a dry organism. So that continued and I added other women to who I would think of when I jerked-off.

During this time, my aunt, who was living in the apartment next to us, got cancer. She didn’t have a lot of money, so she did what a lot of people do; she went back to our country and looked for someone who was willing to pay to marry her to get a visa into this country. The guy that she met and married, also, had a son, Danny. They immigrated to this country during the spring when I was 9, Danny was 12 or 13. He was a cool older kid that wanted to hang out with me and my brothers.

Ok so this is the part I need figure out.

I guess the first thing that happen was my older brother, Danny, and I compared penises. Base on other guys’ statements, this type of stuff appears normal. I was fascinated by Danny’s. It’s much larger and he also said he could make cum. I never saw cum before, so my brother and I left Danny to jerk-off alone. We came back a few minutes later and saw his cum. During this summer, he would frequently show his penis to us like it was nothing.

On day while my parents were busy cooking, my older and younger brothers were watching something boring on TV and wouldn’t let me change it. So I got mad and decided to sneak out of the house and go next door to Danny’s without telling anyone. My aunt’s apartment and our apartment shared a kitchen wall. I decided to hop on the counter to try and listen to see if my parents notice that I was gone. Danny approached me and said “Do you want to try something?”, I responded with “Sure”. He kissed me. My first kiss. I kissed him back. I liked it. It was exciting. We then started to make-out. We eventually made our way to the kitchen floor. He removed out clothes and soon we were groping, grinding, and making out. He flipped me over and started to grind his dick between my ass cheeks. He wanted to penetrate me anally, but something inside of me did not want that to happen. I clench my cheeks really tight and told him that I didn’t want to. He continued to grind on my butt and eventually I got tired. So we got dress and I went back home where no one notice I was gone. (That part makes me more upset than anything else)

I would like to say that was the only time, but it wasn’t. It went on like that for the entire summer and fall. It came to end not because someone caught us or I told. The following winter my parents bought a house. My aunt was going to move in with my other aunt to help take care of her. Danny and his Dad were going to live with some relative a few states away. They would visit and we would hook up like before. They stopped visiting when I was in the 6th grade after they got their permanent visas. My aunt passed away when I was in the 11th grade and I meet up with him again. Nothing happen, but he was married and living a normal live and still is to this day as far as I am concern.

I grew up in the era of the “A very special episode” of TV shows. They would talk about drugs, AIDS, child abuse and sex abuse. After watching these shows, I told myself that I was a victim and molested. Danny took advantage me. He had to. If he didn’t, that would mean I was something that was the worst thing that you could ever be in school or home. A faggot. My parents always talk badly and made fun of gays and so did guys at school. I couldn’t be one. Danny made me lust after guys. He turned me into this. I’m just a victim. He’s the reason why I like and look at gay porn and check out guys. Prior to Danny I was thinking about women. It had to be Danny. He was the monster. But I couldn’t tell anyone. If I did it would destroy my family. To this day, you guys reading this are the only people outside of Danny and me that know about this.

I did everything I could to be invisible. I wasn’t the mischievous kid that always got into trouble. I turned in to the good little boy that always behaved, did all his homework, and was a straight A student. I didn’t want anyone to notice me or take an interest in me. I was really good at turning any attention towards me onto others. Hence I did make friends, some really good ones and was never bullied. Everyone like the guy that gives credit to others and make them shine. So that what’s I did.

I want to stop thinking of myself as a victim and stop being invisible. I look back and wonder, “Did Danny help me discover another side of my sexuality?” I never allowed myself to think about that growing up. Every time those thoughts would pop up I say he inserted those ideas into my head. I never let myself think about what happened. I spent the better parts of two decades trying not to think of what happen to me, but lately I spent a lot time reading other straight, gay, and bi men’s stories about growing up, including erotica and that made me think about my childhood. Many guys say that knew they were different from an early age and had a friend (or fantasize about a friend) when they were younger that they would fool around with. Then something clicked. I realize that in order to prove to myself that I didn’t have sexual feeling towards men I made Danny into pedophile. He was only 4 years older than me, barely a teenager himself. I would like to say that he initiated all the encounters, but he didn’t. I initiated most of the encounters. Were there times when he wanted to hook-up and I didn’t? Yes, but the inverse is true. Whenever one of us wanted to stop fooling around we did. To be honest, it seem like it was a mutual desire on both of our parts.

This thought process started when I was forced to watch “That’s My Boy” with my friends. They talk about how lucky all those boys are that get to hook-up with their hot teacher. I would tell them that she was a predator and the kids are victims and will grow up fucked up (like me). It shouldn’t be treated differently because it was a woman that was the abuser. My friend said to me “They grow up fuck up cause everyone tells them what they did was wrong.” That was the second light that went off. I spend my entire life thinking I was a victim and being a wallflower cause I was led to believe that doing anything sexually with a guy was wrong. If Danny was chick, imagine how popular I would be telling the other guys that at age 9 I hooked up with a hot 13 year old girl? Everyone would pat me on the back tell me that I was “the man” most wouldn’t believe me. Why shouldn’t my frame of thought be “I am a lucky bisexual man that happens to hook up with his first guy at age 9 and not get the shit beat of him?”

Most of my previous experience is in being a bottom and I like to think I'm pretty damn good at it, but I consider myself versatile and really like to do both. My boyfriend is pretty exclusively a top. The few times that he as allowed me to try and top him have been largely unsuccessful.  

A couple of months ago, we had a discussion and I told him that I wanted to be able to top more.  He was actually very reasonable and told me that he wanted that too, however bottoming is just very uncomfortable for him. Since that conversation a few months ago, I have only topped once and have had many failed attempts. He can barely tolerate even one finger inside of him before he is in too much pain and asks me to stop. I don't really understand how a finger could possibly be painful, and as I'm quite a bit bigger than a finger, I don't see this situation improving much.

I really like this guy and we get on really well, but this issue is making me seriously question our relationship.  Whenever I try and top him, I try and take it extremely slow, but he just seems unable to bottom.

Has anyone had a similar experience?  Does anyone have any advice?

Original post here:

So after a night out drinking with him, I went home and wrote an email ... explaining that I'd had a thing for him for a long time, and that when he flirted without meaning it, it was kinda painful for me. And other stuff, but that's the gist.

He responded with, more or less: it's a lot to process; I don't ever mean to hurt you; I didn't intend to flirt, this is just how I am; sex is cheap, but good friends are hard to find. 

Et cetera.

And the next morning flew out on a two week vacation.

So, yeah. The hopeful part of my brain says, ""oooh, he never said *no* or *I'm not interested*, did he?"" 

While the realistic part says, ""he just nicely told you he just wants to be friends."" And, if we're gonna be frank - he's a great deal more attractive than me. And his boyfriends are pretty shiny twinks, while I'm more of a hairy otter.

Walk into my sixth period, boom, super cute gay-looking kid in my English class. I liked him immediately.

I wasn't sure if he was gay, I wasn't sure what to even do with myself. I was too excited, lol.

I was partnered up with him and stuff and it was awesome.

Anyways, turns out Zach is Crystal's little brother.

Crystal is the head of the cheer squad, and she LOVES me. Slow motion hugs in the hallways and stuff, we call each other besties, etc. She knows I'm not straight, and she still loves me.

2 weeks go by, I'm still starry eyed.

First home football game, he's sitting with his family and some of our mutual friends.

I go up there to spend some hangout time with Zach, and end up talking to his parents the whole time. About sports and the school and whatnot. You know, working my parent charm.

They loved me! I was making them laugh the whole time and we had a conversation for like 30 minutes.

After the game, they asked Crystal about me cause they liked me so much. And she told them I was gay.

Zach's dad is a pastor.

And boom like that, I was Satan.

But also after the football game, Zach texted me and told me he was so glad he saw me. first time he had said anything about liking me, really.

And then one of our mutual friends confirmed that Zach was gay. Zach told them that they could tell me.

The thing is, Zach is super obviously gay. His voice and personality and even his body language gives everyone a clue.

His parents obviously don't know he's gay. He said if he ever told them they'd disown him.

Time goes on and on, we start talking a LOT. Like constant texts and whatnot. Not really much in school though, the only time we ever saw each other was in sixth period.

Then one weekend, he asked me out. :::::)))))

Annnnnddd I said no.

said that we need to spend time together in school and stuff, even out of school.

And then we came back to school, and it begun. We hung out between every class, spent time together before school, and bonded in sixth period.

I asked him out four days later and of course he said yes. (: all was well, except we had to hide from his sister.

It was great, dude. We exchanged necklaces and wore them all the time to be reminded that in a year when his sister wasn't at the school anymore he could be open. Mostly to have each other with us all the time.

Cute stuff like that, all the time.

About two weeks later, we kissed for the first time. It was the perfect day.

It was amazing. Best kiss ever, dude.

After that school day, we were texting like normal, and then he randomly stopped without saying anything. This wasn't normal.

He didn't talk to me for the rest of the day. My friend Ali had talked to Crystal cause they're friends and stuff, and Crystal told Ali she was ""having family issues"" and to pray. Ali told me and that's when I started to get suspicious.

The next day at school, Zach wasn't there. Crystal was, though.

And when I had my normal run-in with her in the halls, she just looked at me, and then looked at her feet and walked by.

Yes.

I was about 80% sure Zach's parents found out somehow and were torturing him. I was worried.

Turns out I was right.

The day after he was absent, he was there. In the morning we met in our normal spot and talked.

He told me what had happened.

He told his family everything. They didn't even find out, he told them.

Crystal was hysterical. His mom grabbed him by his shirt and shook him.

His dad screamed, his dad cried, his dad got on his knees and screamed and cried and then threw up more than once.

Then his dad took action.

His dad took everything from him. He sold his phone and iPad after going through and reading all of our text messages.

He took his ""gay seeming"" clothes and burned them, lol.

Told him he was going to receive Christian counselling.

Told him he was going to change, or he was not allowed to live in their house.

And then his dad went up to the school and started raising hell.

He got Zach switched out of his sixth period, just because I was in there.

He got switched out of his World History class, just because the teacher is very openly pro-gay.

He sort of ""recruited"" teacher lookouts to let him know if they ever saw me and Zach together.

And then Zach said that it'd probably be better if we weren't together for now, which probably wasn't a bad idea. I was sort of really upset at the time because he gained all that courage to tell his parents and he didn't even stand up to the ridiculous but expected consequences. He was actually complying with all of that stupidness.

I gave him his necklace and stormed off. Dramatic stuff like that.

And then he wrote me a note. And then I wrote him a note. And then he wrote me a note. And then I wrote him a note. And then he wrote me a note. And then we started sneaking around and meeting up places between class.

It was hard, but at least we were still basically together. Every time we got to talk or touch each other, it was super special since it was so limited.

That went on for about three weeks, actually. And then he left a note and his pocket and his parents found it.

Of course they did.

I'll tell you what happened next.

Mind you, I didn't yet know that his parents found out for a second time.

I call this part of the story ""The Ambush"".

I went to go see Zach before fourth period, outside the library. One of our normal meeting spots.

I see him, and I run up to give him a hug, then he stops me and he says ""I need to talk to you.""

And then mother fucking Crystal walks out from behind a bush. What the hell, man.

I had gone from like best friends with her to total enemies without a word, and this was our first word.

Okay, here goes the dialogue of The Ambush.

It starts off with Zach saying as gayly as possible, ""This weekend, I gave my heart to God"".

I sorta giggle and say okay.

And then Crystal and him both tell me I need to like stay away from Zach because I'm his temptation and he's trying to change.

Retarded dumb shit like that.

And then Crystal was like, ""and I didn't want it to seem like I was being mean to you, I just felt like you were stealing my brother away from me, you know what I mean?"" And I rolled my eyes, laughed, then I said ""No. I don't know what you mean."" Then stormed away. (I like storming away)

Then after that, I was pissed. I was done. I didn't deserve any of this. Was it even worth it?

So like every time I saw him in the halls I'd sort of give him a sort of disappointed or sad look, and he'd give it right back. Or I'd totally purposely make him see I was avoiding eye contact with him.

But finally I cracked. We were walking by each other. We were totally prepared to give sad/mad looks to each other. But I just couldn't do it, and I gave him a giant smile and he gave me a giant relieved smile.

And then walking down the halls became a special thing and those smiles are like the best smiles in the world.

Still no talking though.

No notes because the 'lookouts' now knew to look out for the notes.

Everyone in the school loves us so lots of people help us out.

Our friend Caitlin, let's him use her phone all day to text me during school.

On the way to fifth period we go in the exact same direction at the same time so we walk really close together and talk.

Our friend Priscilla conveys messages all the time.

And Zach got switched into yearbook.

So he's always running around doing errands and taking pictures.

And he goes out of his way to come into my classes and stuff. :')

Like he convinced someone to give him the band page so he could get to spend that little time with me.

And now we've started to have little meetups during school again. It's crazy, really. If he gets caught with me again, he'll almost definitely get kicked out. His parents (mostly his dad) said that it'd be like he was choosing me over his own family.

Since Zach told his family that he is straight again, his dad wanted him to prove it. By getting a girl friend.

Now he's ""dating"" this girl. Katie. She's in on it, at least. It's not a real relationship at all. But they walk around holding hands and stuff. Needless to say, his dad and sister are happy and very proud.

I'm not sure they'd be very happy if they found out he dropped the L bomb on me.
This went on for a little while. The girl and him “broke up.”

Then this final week- the week before Christmas break- we didn't really talk or see each other.
We didn't really talk and therefore didn't really arrange any times to see each other.
I didn't talk to him because i wanted to sort of space myself from him before the break so I wouldn't miss him too much over the two weeks.
But I wasn't really sure what was going on with him.
So on the way to class the day before Christmas break, I caught up with him and had a very casual conversation.
me- ""Hey remember me?""
""Yeah. I can't talk to you anymore.""
""uhhhh why""
""my parents found out again.""
""uhhh how""
""they wouldn't tell me.""
""uhhhh okay... well.. uhhh bye!""
And that's literally the last time I've talked to him.
Or made eye contact with him.
I was okay. I was sort of happy. I was mad he wasn't going to tell me that BEFORE Christmas break. If I hadn't went and talked to him, I would've thought we were still a thing over the break.
I heard from one of his friends that his plan was to just not talk to me and hope I'd move on so he didn't have to have confrontation. Something along those lines.
But yeah, wasn't really upset at all.
Heard nothing from or about him over the Christmas break because, you know, his dad doesn't let him have contact with the outer world.
Okay well school starts again.
And apparently he asked this girl out with flowers(Courtney).
And she said yes. And apparently it was real.
I'm really good friends with this girl and I'm still good friends with this girl.
She eventually breaks up with him because you know, he’s gay. A month into the relationship, the most they had done was hold hands.
Time passes on and on with us avoiding eye contact and acting like we didn't know each other.
And I've been okay with this.
But I've started to have dreams about him.
And people have started talking to me. Including his best friend Amber.
And she's basically told me that he's still crazy about me.
And truthfully I'm still crazy about him even though I shouldn't be.
The girl that he supposedly dated, Courtney, now likes me. She's really cool and I kind of like her, too. And the plot thickens.
She realllllly likes me. She wants to date, and I kind of want to date her too. She asked Zach if he'd be okay and we dated and he got mad because he still likes me. He sort of had his re-coming out, because he had swore up and down he was straight.

Now I have no idea what to do. I like Courtney, I could see myself dating her, but I REALLY still like Zach. It's wrong, I know, but something about him I can't let go.  

Please, I need some kind of advice or guidance or something. But we need to stop liking each other. I don't know.

1361751052.0,12,self.askgaybros,195s7e,"Long post: I have a rare disease that limits my activity and ability to lie down, along with other issues. Should I expect to have a love life?",anongaybro,13,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/195s7e/long_post_i_have_a_rare_disease_that_limits_my/,"Hello bros, I'm fairly new to Reddit, but I was hoping to get some opinions on my situation and see if I should put myself out there or how to go about it. It's rather complicated, and I type lots, so this will be a long post (a very long post, I'm so sorry). I'm also stupidly tired and only here because I looked at Grindr for the first time and was bummed out because I want a boyfriend, but I'm not really able to engage in physical activity without dying (this includes sex) or even lay at anything less than a 45 degree angle. And I'm chubby/fat. I've always been a video game nerd and not really went outside much. Now I can't do much to try to lose the weight, and I've been depressed.

I've not dated much and only been with a few guys, I live near the Missouri/Arkansas border, so there are about (hyperbole ahead) 10 gay guys within 100 miles of me, 3 of which I've dated, 5 of which are 50+, etc.

If you want to know, I'm 24, 5'10"" and 240lb. I read in my CT Scan reports that I have Gynecomastia (woman breasts), but more on that later.

But the issues that make me reluctant to put myself out there and try to date anyone (if I can find anyone to date) are several. The fact that I'm overweight and with so few guys around there is a slim chance any are chasers. I took a picture a moment ago, but I am reluctant to share it on the internet. Since I've been depressed I've decided to let my hair and beard grow out, and so I look like a chubby unkempt hobo. This will probably not last, as I don't think I have a face capable of looking good with Arin Hanson's glorious locks AND Jon Jafari's beard. It's too much for one man to possess. Plus my beard trimmer broke, so the beard is... Untamed. Much like a wild stallion, such beauty and power.

The biggest thing is that I have a very rare auto-immune disease that I was diagnosed with about 18 months ago. It's called Fibrosing Mediastinitis, and it is caused by exposure to the Histoplasma Capsulatum fungus (Histoplasmosis). 1% of the people who get Histo develop this disease as a result, from what I've read. Originally, I was told with 90% certainty that it was cancer: Lymphoma. But after several biopsies and a Mediastinoscopy, it was discovered to be a granuloma. Basically, my body overreacted to the fungus and went crazy with its ""healing"" and the effect is a bunch of scar tissue around and in my vitals, like someone poured concrete into my chest cavity.

This scar tissue is occluding my arteries and veins so that my blood doesn't flow well to my right lung (pulmonary artery) which has deteriorated some, or back down from my head (superior vena cava), and squeezing on my bronchial tubes and esophagus to some degree. I used to cough up blood a lot. The scar tissue may continue growing until it succeeds in killing me as well. However, it seems to be stable for now. I have to get yearly CT scans from now on to monitor it, although there isn't anything they can do really. It's all bonded to my organs and stuff, ""like melted plastic was poured into [my] chest"" one doctor put it. If they try to operate to remove it or whatever, there's a good chance they'll have to take my lung, and that I could very easily bleed to death on the table, since it's all over my arteries and veins around my heart. I believe the vena cava is supposed to be something like 15mm diameter, but mine is squeezed to ~1mm.


This means that I cannot lay down, bend over, or be very active (having my blood pump harder) because the blood stays in my head and accumulates, causing headaches, vision problems, swelling, possible anyeurisms, etc. I also have chronic chest pain that is sometimes pretty bad. This upper body swelling is known as Superior Vena Cava Syndrome, but mine is rather mild (because it doesn't happen at all times, i.e., when I'm standing) and only really noticeable when my head isn't elevated enough. I sleep in an inclined hospital bed and have been put on a CPAP (sleep apnea device) for my breathing/oxygen levels when I'm asleep. I also have blue bruised looking spots on my chest where my body is trying to grow ""collateral veins"" to reroute past my blocked vena cava.

As you might imagine, being unable to lay flat or bend over (doggy-style anyone?) makes sex and cuddling type stuff rather difficult. I can tolerate being in compromising positions for a short while, but I get bad headaches and my vision starts to ""blank-out"" and turn white, as happened the last time I tried to have sex (yes, it was doggy). One of the doctors at the Mayo Clinic told me that if I stay too long in a bad position my head will ""literally explode"" because of the pressure of all the blood being unable to get back down to my heart. Obviously it wouldn't be a dramatic explosion, but you get the idea. As long as I have a couple pillows under my shoulders/head though, I am mostly okay.

Bonus health story: I've also recently had a Cubital Tunnel Release performed on my left elbow because I had severe ulnar neuropathy. It turns out I had an extra muscle in my elbow pressing on the nerve (something &lt;5% of people have! I'm so good at lotteries). I might regain feeling in a few years. In the meantime I have a retard hand that likes to hit caps lock sometimes.

Unfortunately, due to medical bills and said health, I live with my parents, of whom only my father knows I'm gay (my mother's family are messed up backwoods bible thumping types from Arkansas). At the advice of family and friends, I have applied for Disability, but I do not know if I will receive it. My dad also lost his job during the middle of all of this, it was a mess and things were pretty bad. Both my parents were then trying to find jobs, my mother had left her job at Wal-Mart some years before when my nephew was born, against my advice that she couldn't just quit her job to hang out with her grandchild all the time. Thankfully, my dad just found a job about a week ago, so we aren't going to all die or live in a cardboard box just yet.

**Anyway... It feels good just to talk about this, this is my first throwaway account. I realize I tend to ramble and maybe expound too much, I apologize. I like to use words and not omit things (also parantheses).**

Point of this post: Should I continue to make do with a Fleshjack, or is there hope of a loving, cuddly relationship with a cute, stocky, smart, funny guy that likes to play video games?

I'm gonna be going away for the military soon, so it's probably the last time we'll go out together. 

Anyways, drinks were had and we all did some flirting with some ladies. It eventually started to die down and one of my buddies was a little drunk and got kicked out. My other buddy stayed back so I went with my other friend to watch over him.

There was nowhere for him to go and I didn't want him to stumble into the middle of the street or get into a fight. So we just walked a bit, and I'm holding him up / guiding him. He can always get kind of affectionate and he kept kissing me on my cheek saying that he's gonna miss me an things along those lines.

We grabbed some food and then we took a cab back to my place. Now I have other room mates who were sleeping and had work the next morning so I just brought him into my room and it's no big deal to share a bed with your friend of 8-9 years.

I'm going to say this now, that I've never really done anything gay. I don't identify as gay, and my buddy has never identified as gay (at least to me and our circle of friends, he has a girlfriend).

Well soon enough we fall onto the bed and we're kind of close and he's once again going on about how he can't believe I'll be away. And uh...we kind of have each other in our arms, rubbing our heads, and he say's something along the lines of ""You can do anything you want with me and I won't mind.""

I kind of laughed and asked 'what about a massage?'

He readily agreed so I started on his back/body as he's on his stomache.

Eventually I asked if he really meant I could do anything and he said yes, so I started to get a little more bold with my hands.

We were still talking this whole time about random stuff.

And well, I could tell he was hard, and my hands were in the area. He was obviously liking it and I just went for it. So I kind of pulled his cock out and he was still okay with it, and very hard. And I started to stroke him, but then after a bit, he kind of jumped up and said something like:

""No, wait a minute? You're actually touching my cock?""

Well I got really shy and nervous and I stopped and pulled away.

I told him I was sorry, and then a wave of regret and shame kind of just hit me.

I moved myself away from him, and kind of just felt like the biggest piece of shit in the whole world.

So I told him again that I was honestly sorry and that I shouldn't have.

He said it was okay, but I still felt bad about it.

He told me to come closer to him again, so I did. He put his arm around me and he was rubbing my head/hair.

He said that I shouldn't be sorry, but I told him again that I still feel really bad.

Soon enough, he just took out/guided my hand to his cock. Inviting me to stroke it. Then he pulled it out more and pulled his jeans down a bit.

I kept stroking him off and he said ""Don't be sorry.""

So I went down and started to suck his cock.

Soon enough, we're both naked and I'm sucking him a lot.

He gave me head also, and then I was on top of him.

I let him fuck me, and then we 69ed.

This all went on for a while, but then we got tired and went to sleep.

Well...we woke up naked, next to each other. And he went to feel my leg and then he looked over to me and said something like ""What the fuck man, I just thought you were (his girlfriend)?. Oh man, I remember what we did last night.""

I'm not so sure how he felt about it. We were making jokes about it, but still. When he first got up, he said he didn't wana look at me in the face. It did seem kind of like a joke, but I think he was a bit ashamed. 

I said that we shouldn't make it a big deal and he agreed. We said something about not telling anyone, and some more jokes.

He said that he didn't believe it was my first time, but I told him that it honestly was.

I got him some water and what not. But he did say that he blamed me for last night. This too, came out a bit like a joke, but we both knew there was some truth behind how he felt.

Well, we're both up and soon he has to leave to go to work and he tells me to call him later.

We make some more jokes and it seems like everything is fine.

We texted a bit throughout the day, some more jokes about last night, but then he kind of just stopped answering.

I'm not going to keep texting him and calling him like crazy, but he told me to meet up with him and our other friends last night, so I figured I'd call/text him to figure it out.

He didn't answer my first two texts, so I gave him a call. No answer there also, so like an hour or so later I tried again, and he didn't answer.

He is cute and fun and smart. I said I'd be his friend, give him advice, etc. Over time he pushed to meet me and I said fine, we met in a public place and had a good talk. His maturity seems 10 years past his age. I find him attractive but have always been really clear I'm not looking for anything. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago when he comes up to visit his mom. He asks to meet up and says he wants to see my place (shocking, I know). We talked for a bit and then he pounced on me. Made out, messed around for a bit- it was really laid back and fun with good chemistry. Again I said this was as friends/fun and he said he understood. 

Haven't seen him since then but we still chat, it gets flirty, and he surprises me with his perspective on things, work ethic, worldly-ness, etc. I find myself thinking about him a lot and he says we have a connection, etc. I feel something, but feel conflicted too. I just turned 38 and while I'm fit and look younger, I'm 16 years older with a lot more life and experience under my belt! I told him I feel kinda creepy about anything more and am afraid I'd hurt his feelings. 

What do y'all think? Should I listen to my logical side or my emotional side? Sometimes I feel I'm interested because the attention is exciting, but I genuinely like him and want to talk and see him.

I'm emotionally shutting down. 

I love this guy (my ex). He's the only person I've ever been able to see a life with. The thought of being near him still sends chills down my spine. I still see him for a few hours once or twice a week, due to circumstances that can't really be changed.

I've dated 4 guys since we broke up. Two of them, I called ""boyfriend"" and we were exclusive for 4-5 months, until they realized where they rank in my life. I didn't love any of them. I got tired of being alone, I really wanted to cuddle, so I put myself out there, pretended to be not broken, and lured them into a relationship with me. I feel absolutely horrible when I think about the things I did to these guys, especially the two I seriously 'dated.' I knew I was just going through the motions while their feelings were genuine. I just really wanted someone to hold.

I can't genuinely fall in love. I can fake it, I can go through the movements better than just about anyone, but in the last five years, I haven't felt real love for anyone other than my ex. I want to stop hurting other people. So, I'm romantically shutting down.

Career wise, I'm finding tremendous success. When I think about my life moving forward, I think about my work. Relationships haven't worked out, but I'm poised to be a pretty decent teacher. My thoughts are becoming more and more ""Enjoy your work. Enjoy your students. Buy a dog.""

No one here though, and I talked to this friend.....and he asked me if I had lost it already, my virginity. And of course, I lied. I said yes and made up a story. Which was extremely painful for me now that I am accepting. He was happy, he rejoiced for me......

My friends and I were all drinking and I guess I had a little too much because 30 min of that night I do not remember - the first thing I remember is that everyone else from the living room is gone and I'm just chatting with one other friend who's there.  We keep talking and he makes an excuse to go into his room, when he closes the door he just asks ""So you're gay, right - and our other friend is gay too?""  and then goes on to say how its not fair that society pressures us to like girls etc, etc, etc.  We talk until 5am and come back to that topic when he says that he's confused (he's had a girlfriend before but that didn't get too serious) and just doesn't know.

I woke up to 3 txts within an hour asking what our code for the downstairs lock was...he actually wanted to come sleep in my bed.

Since then it's been a little awkward and we've never talked that seriously before, but usually on weekends it'll be us staying awake all night just hanging out together (he taught me how to solve a rubix cube this weekend haha).

It's really hard to get him alone because 1) none of our friends even have a suspicion that he's bi 2) his bedroom is right next to the common area where everyone hangs out in our house and 3) our friends have a tendancy to hang out together all. the. time. so its really hard to just get alone time.

I'm feeling anxious after losing my virginity.,dpimh,11,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1kj6vz/help_im_feeling_anxious_after_losing_my_virginity/,"I know that this is a long post, but I don't have any close friends to talk to about this and I really need to get this off my chest.

**TL;DR: A guy came on me. I rubbed his semen on my stomach then jerked myself off. How worried should I be about an STD/HIV?**

I'm a 22 y.o. long-time lurker and a first-time poster. I just had sex for the first time earlier this evening. I just began coming out to friends a few months ago and I haven't been actively looking for sex, so when I woke up this morning I had no idea I would be sitting here tonight writing this post. Here's the deal:

There's this guy at my gym who I've noticed checking me out a few times before. Earlier this evening we were alone in the sauna and we started flirting. I agreed to go back to his house to play. This guy is the type of guy who I've long fantasized about; he's in his 40s, handsome, hairy, and well built. 

Anyways, we both showered and got dressed then I followed him home to his nicely restored historic home in a fairly upscale neighborhood. I tend to be a very risk averse person, so of course I was a bit apprehensive about following a stranger home without telling anyone else. 

We chatted for a bit and I noticed a stethoscope on his foyer table. I find out he's a doctor and I get the sense that he's a pretty nice guy. I told him that I was a virgin and while he did seem a little taken aback, he was fine with continuing our little ""experiment.""

Once we were upstairs, we chatted a little in his bed and slowly our clothes started to come off. With it being my first time and all, everything was a bit awkward. However, he turned out to be a really sensitive lover because before he did anything new he explained what he wanted to do and asked me if I was OK with it. I feel lucky that my first time was with this guy because the whole time he kept making sure I was OK with what we were doing. I assume that because of the 20 year age difference he wanted to make sure I didn't feel like he was taking advantage of me.

We did all the usual things I suppose guys do together: we kissed (my first time romantically kissing anyone ever btw), rubbed dicks together (no penetration), and gave each other blow jobs and hand jobs. I told him I didn't want to do anal and he was perfectly OK with that. 

Everything felt really good and he was really hot; unfortunately, because of my nerves I went soft a few times and was not able to orgasm.

**Here's what's bothering me**: I let him come on my stomach while I was laying on my back jerking off. In the heat of the moment, I rubbed his cum all over my stomach then continued jerking off with both hands for another minute or two. Could I have exposed myself to HIV? Should I seek post-exposure prophylaxis? 

I know that everything we did was pretty low risk, but I can't help but think that there is a chance something could have been transmitted when I jerked off my dick after touching his cum. I do know that there is a risk of transmitting things like herpes and HPV when doing what we did, but I'm mostly worried about HIV.

In retrospect, I know that hooking up with a random guy like I did probably wasn't the best idea, but I think things turned out fairly well considering the circumstances.

So this summer I came home after my first year of college and took a great summer job at a place that I was involved in a lot in high school. My job responsibilities mostly include general maintenance, keeping the facility looking nice, and completing any tasks that any of the supervisors see that need done. So the guys I work with are basically the handymen at my work, and very macho, but still friendly.

They invited me for a night out, and I was thrilled until I found out it's at a strip club. They are not going to take no for an answer, even though I keep trying to say it's not my thing. I recently came out at college, but no one at this temporary summer job knows I'm gay.

My dilemma is, I don't know what to do...just go along with it and be uncomfortable and nervous the whole night, or tell them why I don't wanna go and risk what would happen. Dudes, what would you do? Anyone have experience at a strip club while closeted?

So what happened was that I was sleeping over at my best friends from Saturday to Sunday, and we are incredibly incredibly close. We both acknowledge one another to be the closest we are with another person ever. But he is also kind of touchy-feely. So this eventually lead to the night being spent with him tickling me a lot, us wrestling, and kind of laying near each other while I rubbed his back or hair. One of the larger moments being me kissing him in order to make him uncomfortable enough to get off of me from tickling me. (Although, I did this before the first time we ever hung out because we were playing a game to see who could go the longest while everyone else made the person uncomfortable, and that is what I did to win). And he is only really seeing how bad all of this is now after the fact, what this could mean to his girlfriend if she knew we did all of this. Furthermore, him and I have cuddled a lot before and regularly hug and tell each other that we love them. I haven't told him I made this post asking him for help, and I do not want to because he is the type of person who wouldn't care for it, but I need the help myself too.

What do you all think could happen? 

Is there anything I can do to help?

Just general advice on what to do please.

It was great, I like the guy, he knew what he was doing, and despite having a huge cock (I bottomed) he didn't hurt me too much. We had a pint of beer, but that was it (I normally don't drink before sex).

The thing is, I didn't have an orgasm or come close. In fact, I didn't feel much pleasure or pain (after a while). And this isn't the first time it's happened to me. (I'm cut, but don't believe my circumcision is to blame).

It began with nipple play. He loved it when I played with his nipples - licking, sucking, nibbling, twisting/massaging. He tried to do the same with me, but I could feel a whole lot, and we just decided that I didn't have sensitive nipples. I joked that it must be the distribution of nerve endings: I am extremely ticklish, but he isn't. I don't have sensitive nipples, but he does. He kissed, licked, sucked on my neck and I normally like that, but this time I didn't feel much.

He also sat on my dick (which he doesn't do because he's a top, but he said he liked my dick). The thing is, I've never topped so I tried to fuck him, and I had trouble staying hard and getting it in. Oddly, I could barely feel with my dick... I couldn't feel if I was in or not, let alone pain or pleasure. I've heard so much about how great sex/ using one's penis is, but this one I felt like I was doing more for him and nothing for me.

The majority of the time I bottomed. He had a huge dick and it hurt at first, but after a while it was... It wasn't bad, but I didn't feel much pleasure either. Rather I enjoyed the feeling of his dick actually inside of me, I enjoyed seeing his body move, and I find it hot when the other guy gets off. 

Oddly, this isn't the only time. Every time I've bottomed or received a blowjob, I can't feel much. The only things I enjoyed were getting rimmed and having my neck sucked. And for masturbating, I have to be quite vigorous.

I don't know what's up, and am wondering if this is common. What is sex supposed to feel like? Do tops enjoy it and cum, do bottoms cum too? How does one enjoy it? What should I do? I don't want to say the guy was bad (there's too many people I've hooked up with and had the same outcome).

Just to add to the problems, every time we manage to get over the initial pain, I cum way too early not giving him enough time to finish himself off.
Has anyone had a similar experience and found ways to make it more enjoyable. I've heard the whole thing of ""just relax"" but I can't take my mind off how painful its going to be when he goes in.

 I have a couple issues and questions I guess I would like some help with. Been a lurker for a while now over on r/gaybros but thought I would finally ask something. 
Basically my question is, ""why are all my attempts at dating failing miserably?""
So to start I have been told I am attractive(cute), funny, smart, educated etc. etc. so I am pretty sure that is not the issue with me and dating. I have been told I am a nice guy, very considerate and loyal. Been also told I am shallow, stubborn and kind of standoffish. So maybe it's a personality defect.
I meet most of the guys I go out with on ""OkCupid"" and ""Grindr"". I know Grindr most likely isn't the best place to look but I have met some really nice guys who I have been interested in dating and not hooking up with so who knows. Regardless after talking to someone the general process below tends to ensue.

1. A party expresses interest
2. Party either accepts interest or declines
3. Assume party has accepted interest. We plan a meet up
4. Chit Chat, dinner, drinks, etc.
5. Go our separate ways for the evening after both expressing interest in meeting again. All interest seems genuine.
6. Keep texting.
7. Everything falls apart for seemingly no reason.

Is this standard? I can't say I have a ton of dating experience so maybe this is how the world works and I am just missing something.

Thanks for any help and opinions.

Edit: I guess I will also ask if anyone has any tips or thoughts about closure after dates. Is it okay to ask if they are interested if things seem vague?

I'm one of the kinds of people I just described, and although it never really bothered me, lately I feel like I am really missing out by not being in a romantic relationship. I'm 24 and have never dated anyone :( . What kind of frustrates me about this, and leaves me at a loss is that I am introverted, but I am not super socially awkward. I make new acquaintances and some friends fairly easily. And although I am kind of hard on myself, I would not classify myself as unattractive; my point being I am not overly self conscious about my looks. 

I know the first thing many here will say is that I NEED NEED to be ""out"". The thing is, I don't have a concealed personality or traits that I need to let out, although I'm sure someone will insist that I do. Coming out would not change me, only other people's perceptions of me. Unless there is a secret sign that I only get by being out, another ""Bro"" wouldn't even know about me anyway, so what difference would being out really make? I've been to gay clubs before, so I am not scared of being in a gay centered place, but these places are not really who I am. To clarify, I don't avoid gay clubs because they are ""too gay"", it's really just not my thing. I've also had no success using dating sites or any of that stuff.

So here's the breakdown:

Since I was a teenager I had mostly straight male friends. So I am used to hanging around with people outside my dating scheme. Sure there was a crush or two, but as a teenager I just jerked it out.

Time Jump: I am now living in a big city with a new circle of friends. 
Still having mostly straight guy friends and my gang of two very close girl friends. The only thing that has changed, that somehow my boys are all a few years older and already stopped living the party hard 
lifestyle., which I as a 24 old student love.

So I am hanging out with the boys in the evening and going drinking with the girls at night. It is exactly the wonderful confusing growing up in a big city I always wanted.

Until Joe showed up.

He just moved with his girlsfriend to the city and joined my theatre group. He is kind of the exact opposite to me and at first we didn't get along very well. But as timed moved on we grew closer as friends. We would go out partying alot and would have the magical conversation only bros could have.

He grew more and more on me. I was even more content with my life now I had a guy friend like in my teenage years.

I have no idea when I realised that I am madly in love with him but since then I feel miserable. I can barely find sleep. I can not concentrated on my work. I stalk him everyday on facebook. This stupid little nerd has turned me, someone who drinks, smokes and swears like a sailor, into a giggling school girl.

That the problem: It is not a crush anymore it is love. I don't want to see him naked and have manly steamy sex with him. No I want to marry him and raise wondeful children. It is horrible. I am stuck in this Disneyesque Daydreams. It has renderd my complete lovelife non existing.

So what can I do?

I don't see me telling him. Telling him ""Oh and by the way you are the man of my dreams so please turn gay now."" would make everything a little bit more akward. Moreover I will see him in my theater group and the group is very important for my social and emotional life so I can't quit. He is 100% straight and happy with his lovly girlsfriend.

I am pretty sure he has no clue. Nevertheless there was this night when we all talked about our dream kind of partner. Being that very talented bastard of an actor we did a spot on impression of my favorite accent, which made me extremly crazy and he enjoyed me kicking and screaming to stop it and the fact I was very turned on.

I found that whenever he made me feel like he was in control or in charge it made me really weak in the knees, like a feeling I'd never had in a relationship with any girl. It's hard to explain, but all of my previous experiences didn't cause me to feel that, I was just sort of indifferent, and dating for the sake of dating. I explained to my boyfriend that I enjoyed him being more guyish and dominant than me in and out of sex, and all hell broke loose. He go pretty pissed off, and said ""that's what all of us [gay men] really want"". And he said he didn't want to be with someone who didn't accept that. He then broke off all contact with me and pretty much ended our relationship. I understand that his reaction was probably a but excessive, but it nevertheless made me feel awful. It's made me feel that if I find being the dominant person in a relationship unfulfilling, that I'm being selfish and a bad partner I guess. The whole experience has scared me away from relationships for the time being, and it's made me pretty depressed to think that what I want is wrong.

On top of all this, I don't really want to come out. Drawing that kind of intense attention to me and then revealing something so personal takes confidence. Confidence I don't have.

The first time I ever messed around with a guy/girl wasn't until I was 20.  And it was pretty much just me being super drunk laying there, as this guy tried to jerk me off...looking back it was super awkward.

It wasn't until a year later that I had a chance to talk to a guy I really liked.  It was probably my first ever ""date"" situation.  I went up to him at the bar, started talking, we made plans to hangout the next day ect.  We ended up going to the park all day and then sat at the beach and watched fireworks for the 4th.  I was too afraid to make a move, we we ended up going out for a drink that night and then coming back.  We get to my room, and I couldn't get it up...I didn't even jerk off for 4 days.  End of it all we just cuddled, but of course, right when he fell asleep while we were in each others arms I started to pop one.

Fast forward to one year later, I got a really spontaneous bite at a Halloween party with a really hot ""straight"" guy.  After a few hours of him asking me questions like ""when did you know"", ect, he came to my room.  We messed around for hours and hours, but the entire time I wasn't able to get it up.  I was super drunk and tired, but even in the morning nothing.

Since then I have been trying to get more exposure around guys.  I was VERY flaky at first in the bar/app scene.  But in the end, the guys who come up to me are not my type, and the ones I try to go after never seem interested.  At the same time, Im afraid to come off as ""slutty"".  I am over 6.5ft tall, fit, bearded, hairy.  I get a lot attention from of the young twink types thinking I am a top.  But I know I am pretty sub/bottom and I like guys who are also slightly older and the hairy type.  Age isn't a +/-, I am comfortable from 2 years younger to 10 years older.

Within the last month, I saw an older guy who was ten years older then me, and we met up about 9 times since first meeting him.  I fell for him HARD...I can't even describe how I felt around him even when we would just cuddle at night.  But even with all of those feelings, I still couldn't get it up, every time.   I would wake up in the middle of the night very aroused, but whenever he would get naked and start putting on the moves I couldn't get it going.  I later learned that he had multiple ""boyfriends"" and was a huge whore, but I am emotionally over all that now.

Is it weird for me to think that I can only get over this problem if I am in a relationship where I can consistently see the same person?  I feel like if I was able to see someone on a regular basis, I would eventually get more comfortable with them...I was 120 pounds heavier then I am now, Im still a virgin, so lots of negative self image surfaces every once in a while.  The other issue is that, if I know I am talking to a guy who sleeps around a lot, it is a total turn off as I am super paranoid about STDs.

**TL;DR**:  
I have been out for 2 years.  Messed around with some guys, wasn't able to get it up.  When the fooling around stops, I can get it up.  Still have some self image problems.

So i've been seeing this guy for about 3 weeks and just last week we had sex for the last time.  He's honestly so sweet to me and always says the right thing at the right time.  He always sends me the nicest texts and genuinely seems into me and I'm into him too.  He can be really sketchy with his texting though and oftentimes won't respond for a day or two with some excuse.  I don't overly text him at all and generally just wait until he texts me (typing all of this out reminds me of how much i hate texting).

Anyway, we had plans to go see a movie together and he has a jacket of mine at the moment, and makes a jokes like ""since I have you're stuff you'll definitely have to see me again haha,"" yet he doesn't ask me out ever and I feel like I always initiate hanging out.  I don't want him to think that I'm over pursuing him or overly interested, it's just hard to see someone once a week and really develop a connection if it's only through texting. 

My main thing that I want advice on is whether or not I should ask him if he wants to be something more serious/date exclusively or what.

My problem is that I keep forgetting to text, or reply to my bf's messages. I told him that I saw the text, but I was doing something else, so I forgot about it. He keeps getting mad at me because, as he said ""I don't care about him."" 
And while we're having sex, or kissing, I keep looking at other things in the room. He would always ask me if I were cheating on him, or I don't find him attractive anymore. 

It also affect my relationship as a whole,  I've been in relationship with 3 guys, and many hookups, and I just realized there is a pattern in all my relationships; which is that I was really interested in them at first, but after 2 or 3 weeks, I would get bored, and not interest in them anymore, then we broke up, and I start seeing another guy, and my friends would always call me a ""man whore"" for that.

Plain, simple, and direct. Although, in my defense, I think the gay environment may have something to contribute to my douchbaggery.  

Sometimes, when I ask guys out, and I do ask out a lot of guys, they are afraid of just saying, ""No, I'm not interested"" or ""I'm flattered, but you're not my type"". These are responses I personally would prefer to receive, instead of the ubiquitous, ""I'm super busy"", ""I'm tired"", ""I think I have something planned"", or my personal favorite, ""I have to go feed my cat"". These remarks are all valid responses, as life typically throws unavoidable shit at us. Trust me, I've been at the receiving end of some pretty fucked up diarrhea. However, as gaybros, don't we have an obligation to be upfront and direct with each other?

I've gotten to the point where I can smell bullshit a mile away, however, for our newer and ever optimistic gaybros, these remarks often promise false hope. For example, after a response of ""I work till late tonight"", I used to respond with, ""No worries, let's meet up Friday for drinks at (name of local bar)"" or ""Sure, just let me know when you're up to hang out"" 

Later, the disinterested party starts to ignore your texts until the inevitable truth sinks in that he just wasn't that into you. I understand that it might make you feel bad rejecting someone, but consider who's the negligent one. In a court of law, you'd be considered the least cost avoider and be deemed liable for damages (thank you Judge Posner). 

Thanks to a background in economics, game theory specifically, combined with studying law, I came into sudden clarity today: **directness in one's intentions saves both parties time, effort, and energy.**Thus, statements like, ""No I don't want to date you"", ""I find you more of a platonic friend than a romantic interest"", or even ""You're touch disgusts me"" are all far better responses than the ""courteous"" response of ""I'm super busy this week""

Having been direct with people, I found out I'd like that same directness given back. Thus, when I'm romantically inclined towards someone, I ask them out. When someone I don't like asks me out, my go to response is, ""Thanks, but I just don't think it's going to work out"" and if they're are persistent (a trait I admire), I revert to ""Please fuck off, I'm really not interested"". 

If you're not interested in me, I don't want a speech of ""it's not you, it's me and my (insert lame excuse)"". As guys, we know that if you're interested in someone, you'll move mountains for them. I mean I once called every ""G. Davis"" in my freshman orientation book just to see if he wanted to grab a ""cold beverage"" with me. Yes, I'll be disappointed that you're not interested in me, but I am a big boy and will get over it. In fact, I might even fall a little more infatuated with you because you were direct.

I mean, so far as people knowing this thing about me is concerned. But I'm really just not trying to advertise.

I think I kind of assumed that the information would trickle out or something and I would find myself maybe meeting people or something. I feel pretty stupid for thinking that it would. 

Well, no such thing has happened, and I realize I don't have the faintest clue how to do this. I've never been with a guy. In fact, I'm not sure I can think of a time where I ever engaged in a conversation with anyone that I could confidently assume was a possible partner.

All my best friends are straight guys. They're perfectly comfortable with me, but I find myself becoming really attached to them, which comes and goes, and takes a massive toll on me emotionally. Particularly because I need to keep those feelings to myself.

It's a lot of pressure and I'm pretty bewildered.

I've always thrived on relationships developing organically, in a 'from the root' kind of way. I've made a lot of friends that way, everyone I've ever dated started that way.

I have a situation that I could use some advice on. There is an incredibly Christian and conservative member (James) of my very liberal friend group. We have all been friends for about a year. Being the only anti-lgbt member of the group, he gets a lot of spirited debate from the majority of our friend group. He is also one of the nicest people any of us have ever met. He approaches the situation with conviction and maturity that even my more liberal friends don't share. 

Things got a little dicey when DOMA and Prop8 went up before the supreme court. He was posting all the reddit-like things you see on the front page that supported inequality in the inane ways. One of my gay friends (Luke) messaged James in a fit of rage. James' response was filled with the message of the love of Jesus, but the ultimate immorality of homosexuality. He then sent an additional message saying that he wasn't as different from Luke as he may have thought. He had been struggling with homosexuality his entire life. He would continue the good fight.

This breaks my heart. I remember my days of deep spirituality, fighting against my homosexuality. I remember how lonely, unhappy, but determined I was. I also remember how resistant I was to help. 

So, my question for you bros (particularly you bros who have shaken off either religion or anti-gay-religious-though):

How did you come to accept that you weren't going to change? 

How did you distance yourself from that religious thought?

Could any other person have been helpful in your self realization? How?

I'm very confident and outwardly warm, welcoming and funny but internally I'm very insecure about how to be gay when I can't be a part of the community. I apologize in advance for this being long but it's a long story and needs full detail. Also, if the person this is about reads this... sorry... I didn't know you were a redditor. Call me?

My story is this. I go to a small, liberal, northeast school with a sub-4,000 person student body which means that within weeks after arriving you've noticed and been in relatively close proximity with almost everyone. When I came to college it was fun to look around at all of the hot guys and hope to be noticed and ask/be asked out by one of them. For financial reasons (homophobic parents paying for college), social reasons (my sport which I have invested 15 years into is incredibly homophobic) and fear of reprisals I had to remain in the closet which meant I couldn't date anyone and my contact with my fellow gays was limited to craigslist/manhunt/grindr hookups only. Being able to dial someone up on Grindr and get my rocks off 20 minutes later would generally do it for me most of the time but more and more frequently I began looking for someone to have an actual connection with. Throughout all of this there was one guy on campus who was a year ahead of I that continued to catch my eye and every time I'd see him I would think to myself that he was the most beautiful guy I'd ever seen and what I could deduce from observing from afar was that his personality was even more attractive than his 9-10 looks. He's a very flamboyant character with lots of friends and always seems to be laughing or cracking jokes. Combine that with Abercrombie-model looks and a solid brain on his shoulders and it was an instantly strong attraction that I hid well and would ponder on from time to time in the ""if life was perfect we'd be together and happy and have amazing sex every night"" way. 

Life went on like this for the first 3 years of my education. I posted good marks, made lots of friends who thought I was straight and had lots of meaningless (but safe!) sex with people who never really were an option to connect with. Finally, with 2 months to go before mystery guy graduated I grew enough stones to post an anonymous message on our school confession facebook page describing what I thought of him, how much I admired him and what I'd like to do to him in bed. A few days later a past hookup of mine and mutual friend of mystery guy asked if the posting was me because apparently mystery guy had been talking about it and was hinting that he was interested in making something happen. As the hopeless romantics among you can appreciate I was well over the moon at this and with time running out I figured that it was my last chance to do something. After a week-long confidence building period I added him as a friend on facebook out of the blue and was quickly accepted. Another week of stressing, writing, rewriting and panic attacks and I sent a message owning up to the posting. To my delight it was very well received and we got to chatting through facebook about all sorts of platonic stuff on and off for 2 weeks. A busy schedule meant I never thought about nor had time to ask him to get coffee or something but we sort of got to know each other through our semi-regular conversations and it was clear that we were both interested in the other person. In retrospect not asking him out on a date is what I regret the most because what happened next might 

As finals started coming around everyone at campus gets stressed and, since it's spring, horny as fuck. Seeing the clock ticking down to his graduation I finally decided to nut up and at least try to get something out of it and volunteered that we could get together and blow off some steam if he was stressed. This obviously hit a chord because within minutes we're sexting back and forth and things are getting really hot and heavy and I then get an invitation to come over to his place the next night. To save time I'll just say that I did indeed go over and that the sex was mutually amazing. Lots of laughing, smiling, moaning, giggling, screaming and adorable pillow talk. We both seemed to have serious chemistry and by the end each of us was expressing expressed interest in keeping something going in the future. A kiss goodnight and I was headed home. The next day he had to work and I had to move out so that night was the last time I saw or spoke to him. 

We're now living 3 hours apart and we've both started summer jobs but we're both on facebook all the time. A few days later, before he graduated, I sent him a facebook message with my phone number telling him that he could text or call me any time. Facebook listed this message as seen immediately afterwards but I never got a text or a reply. Graduation weekend is hectic so I just figured that he was super busy and decided to message him after life calms down. Last night rolls around and I sent a pretty generic ""hey, how are things going?"" message and, again, got no response despite the message being seen.

So with all of the back-story out of the way here's my questions? It's obvious that I'm either being blown off, ignored or being sent a message. What the hell do I do? I like him and he seems to like me and we both had fun and we both wanted to keep something going. Normally I would say that this is how a one night stand ends but that didn't seem to be what either of us wanted. Am I being too suffocating/crazy even though it's been 6 days since my last message? Is he saying ""yeah we had fun but I'm moving on"" by deliberately ignoring my messages? Should I just let it be for the summer and try to strike something back up when we're back to living half an hour apart in the fall? Is it too forward of me to think about messaging him in 2 weeks or so just to try and hope that one day he'll respond? I like this guy a lot and don't want to lose out on something which could be fun. To date he's the only guy I've ever met who I would actually come out of the closet and torpedo my life for and it's a little upsetting to think he doesn't reciprocate those feelings because I'd love to finally make a romantic connection with another human being. 

TL;DR: Long-term crush on a guy, manages to start talking to him, amazing sexytimes ensue, we both want to keep something going afterwards, total radio silence on his end since the second we kissed goodbye. WTF Do I do?

I went on a date with a guy I met from OKC this past weekend. I don't go on many dates, so dating etiquette at 26 is completely lost on me, and I would appreciate some advice.

The guy in question is older than me. I wonder if that should change anything, ie, who contacts who first, or, whatever, even though I think that rules/games/etc are, well, bullshit. I'm conflicted because a friend of mine tells me that I shouldn't have sent a text the day after, that I should wait to hear from him, etc...

We made plans to hang out a second time before the end of our first hang out, something that I feel very positively about. However, I haven't heard much from him, save a response to a text I sent on Monday. My plan is to just go about my week and wait until the day before we're supposed to hang and send a text to confirm that we're still on for the next day if I haven't heard anything.

Part of me is somewhat worried, I guess, but I'm prone to over think things. I don't think I would be so worried were I not genuinely interested in this individual. We got on well, we have things in common, and I found that I enjoyed being around him.

He is also gay, more of a [gaymer](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers), and we get along famously. Like, we could not talk or talk forever and still find things to not talk about. 

No but seriously, from the first time we met it's never been awkward and we always have a fantastic time hanging out together and we both really enjoy eachother's company. And he has told me several times how much he values our friendship and how glad he is that he has found someone who seems to understand him so well. It's just a very natural and deep friendship. But I realize now that I want more.

So I was hoping you fine folks could give me some advice. Any advice at all. It would kill me to lose this friendship, so my plan right now is to do nothing. But I also know that soon enough the regret of not saying anything will also kill me, so basically I am a coward and hopeless and emotionally paralyzed.

I've only ever met one of them in my life so it makes me wonder whether they are common or not.

**2. Should I tell my parents before I go?** My gut tells me 'no.' They have no idea I'm gay and I think that going to college before I tell them will let me figure my shit out before I break the news. They would totally accept me but i think it would change my relationship with them as my dad would just think its me being rebellious (which I'm definitely not.) Should I tell my friends before I leave?

**3. Can I be openly gay and viably join a fraternity?** I think the Greek system offers a lot of unique opportunities and gives me a good network of friends. How should I handle rushing at a frat as a gay man?

**4. What would you tell a guy in my position about his college experience?** There are things I'm definitely not knowledgeable about/experienced in and I'd love to know as much as I can.

My fiance and I have been dating for just over 5 years, engaged in January.  He's been out of state since March staying with family because one of his parents is dying.  I've been driving out once a month to be with them, but couldn't get time off from work to be there the whole time.  

In the last couple weeks, I've had two people who I've never met message me on facebook and tell me he's been fooling around with people on Grindr.  I didn't believe it at first, we deleted our Grindr apps a while ago and agreed we had no use for it anymore (we had used to together in the past, but just to chat with people, never hooked up with anyone).  

This morning I had a THIRD person message me and say the same thing.  At this point I was getting really worried, so I downloaded a gps spoofing app so I could login near his location.  Waited all day, and lo and behold, he logged in an hour ago and messaged my fake profile.  I didn't see it in time before he logged off, so I sent a message back and am waiting for his reply.  Two things:  his profile does say engaged, but it also says looking for relationships and dating.  This is besides the fact that he told me he wasn't using Grindr anymore and hasn't mentioned that he has been since he left.  I intend to wait for him to log back in and see what he says to my fake profile before I confront him about it (if he is cheating I want hard proof before I confront him).  

I'm heart broken and feel so betrayed.  He gets jealous and angry if I do something as benign as say a character in a movie is hot, but has no problem using a gay dating app behind my back??  

I don't know what to do.  I thought I was going to spend my life with this man.  We share everything with each other.  I've never caught him in a lie before.  I feel sick to my stomach and can't stop shaking.  Please help bros!!!!

I had kind of know I was different through middle school and had liked girls but never really knew why I had similar feelings for guys. Then when I joined the football team freshman year I made two friends. Lets name them ""Mike"" and the other ""Phil"". So we were grouped up in football based on our height and weight and so Mike, Phil, and I were paired up because of our similar body types,and we were relatively big but not like fat, (I was the smallest of the three lol). We all instantly became good friends, mostly because it was high school and u wanted to try and make new friends so you weren't the loner lol.

Well I started getting close to these two but I had a particular liking towards Phil (and now I realize it was cause he was Mexican and I love mexican guys lol). We started hanging out outside of school and our second semester we had some classes together. Sat next to each other all semester and he was shy but I thought it was really cute. It was during the spring time that I realized I had a crush on him and that's when I set out on determining his sexual orientation. 

At this point I had not told anyone that I liked guys so this was my attempt at trying to find someone that was like me so I could feel normal in a sense ad that i wasn't alone. We started hanging out even more and I started walking him home. We had our laughs and similarities like about tv shows, video games, stuff like. I was having a hard time figuring him out. 

I later came out to one of my friends from since I was in 3rd grade about him and she was shocked cause I guess she had no idea haha. But she wasn't any help to me and even said I should talk to a counselor to make sure about myself. So in a last ditch effort I came out to Phil to see if he would come out too. Sadly he didn't and we start to drift apart. We were still friends but after sophomore year we stopped talking cause we didn't have classes and yada yada. But even though I was a little heart broken, it finally lead me to realize a part of myself I had been hiding so I am very greatful for the experience =)

What were your guys' first crush like? Did anything happen or was it a flop like mine?

Tl;Dr Made a new friend freshman named Phil and we started getting closer once we had classes together. I realized that I really like him and tried to find out if he was gay. Found out he wasn't and we drifted apart. In the end it sucked but it was a great experience because I learned about myself

This is my first post here, but I lurk on /r/gaybros a lot, and all the bros here give out great advice. Just reading through old threads has been beneficial for me and you guys have already helped me indirectly before. Thanks for that. I also know there are a lot of posts like this  a day, and Im sorry to contribute to the fire, but here it goes. 

I've only been out for a year, came out to my parents a few months ago.  They weren't very supportive, and while they will talk to me they will not acknowledge my sexuality. The past two years have been hard on me as I spent a lot of time avoiding my feelings and general interactions with people. I ended up resenting a lot of different things about myself that I'm still trying to work through. 

A little bit more back story, through out all of this I had a crush on my really good friend who also happens to be gay. Even though I was telling other people I was gay I held off from him, and finally came out to him last January. He said he had a feeling, and asked if I liked him because he had been into me for about a year. I said yeah, and we ended up making out. So we went on dates, ended up hooking up a few times, and it was awesome. I wasn't feeling so shitty, and those things I hate about myself were starting to dissipate. We were getting along really well, and taking it slow because we both didn't want our friendship to get strained. On our last date he asked how I felt about being his boyfriend officially, and said I would like it. It was really starting to blossom, and made these past few months feel fantastic. 

Last night he calls me, and just ends it. Says he doesn't really think he can do this anymore, and tells me about how after we go our separate ways on dates/mornings he just feels guilty. I kept asking him about what, and he said he didn't know. Ke kept telling me that he wants to know why he feels this way, and how hard it was for him to make this phone call. He was getting pretty upset, and told me he still wants to talk to me because like me he feels like no one really listens to him...and I said not for awhile.

I just dont know what to do. I feel really alone. Everything has been so bad and it was just picking up. Guys, how do I get over this? The only person I would have talked to about something like this was him, and I can't really do that. I just want someone, anyone, to give me some advice. 

Thanks, any response would be appreciated.

I am a 26 year old gay guy. I have been out to most people for about 3 years, I am 100% masculine (you wouldn't know to look or talk to me) and I am 100% cool with who I am.

I told my friend in question about 3 years ago I was gay. He said at the time and continually does that he never has and never will have an issue with it and I believed him. We actually moved into a really cool apartment with another friend about 6 months ago and all was perfect until Friday night.

My friend had a celebratory night so I knew he was going on a big one. He got a bag of coke (7pm) and sniffed it with another friend and then they left to go to a bar.

They arrived back (12pm) to me chilling on the couch with a lady friend (with a certain amount of history) and we had smoked 2 spliffs.
He arrived in the door and launched into a coked up rant that last 3-4 minutes, only stopping for air briefly. Then he turned and said he will proceed to ""wrecked our stoned buzz with my coked up buzz"". So he waffled and waffled and waffled some of the most vulgar shit I have ever heard.

I have manners and would never talk the shit he spouts let alone in front of girl. In short he was saying how girls are cum-buckets who are only there to service his massive slong......(not that big, I have seen it!)
So he see the awkwardness in both myself and my lady friend and basically says he doesn't care what we think as ""both of you are the only girls in the room"". This was said with a derogatory air about it.
A few moments later he made an effort to call me lesbian but was quick to reel it in when I made eye contact with him mid sentence. Additionally to this he made other statements to me ""to wreck my stoned buzz"" that aren't really relevant to the title but he was out to humiliate me on those.

He generally has a loose mouth but its never been directed towards me before this.

Now, I am good looking guy who can/has/done/continues to pull much more aesthetically pleasing ladies than he has or ever will. I have a cool job that I have been working towards since I was 15 and have ended up as an ""industry leader"" at a young age.

He is a 28 year old, trainee who has been living out of Mum and Dads pockets his entire life and basically bitches and moans about hard work.
Both myself, himself and our housemate/friend were going to go into business together. The business in question strongly relied on my skills much more than theirs and had the potential to be a great earner for us. He viewed this as an easy way to make money and for bragging rights for the ladies.

FYI - The business venture is well and truly off the table now.

I haven't spoken to my friend in question since Friday night (apart from slamming my door in his face of FEAR on Saturday afternoon). He knows I am pissed off, he has never seen me pissed off in 8 years of friendship (yes, I am that happy with life) but this has pissed me off on a scale I can't comprehend.

So I have a few questions to Reddit....

Am I over reacting to the him calling me a girl/lesbian? 
Is the blame it on the coke response he will give me valid? 
Should I forgive, forget and move on? 
Or..should I take this as an early warning and underlying issue, cut my loses and forget about him?

I'm 23 and 4 months ago I found the man of my life (I might be overreacting but it really feels like it). He is my first boyfriend and first person i have intimate relation with. (He had sex with several guys before, but haven't been in any kind of relationship with them). He is like 10/10 for me (little chubby bearded redhead). 
Last month we started having some fun in bed. But unfortunately I have problems with getting hard. At the beginning it felt terrible. I felt useless and almost cried each time he asked me if he's doing something wrong (he was doing perfect). Actually at some point I have to jerk myself and let him finish when I was close (last night it took more than 3 hours!)

I think I am having problem with the fact that my whole life I was masturbating a lot and I am not used to other person doing that. I love him and I want him to see how much I enjoy that. We talked a lot about it and he said that he completely understands this and will help me to deal with it. But I am having doubts.
Do you think that I will be able to eventually deal with this? Will time spent with him help me? 
Do you have any kind of advice that could help me?

Last summer i started talking with a dude, let's call him Matthias(same age as me, 20) he looked cute, fun and friendly so i thought why the heck not and met up with him. Fast forward 2 weeks and we were really hitting it off, having fun and stuff so one night i told him how i felt about him.

He also said they were going to meet up tomorrow so he wanted advice because he was nervous. I started giving him some advice but i slowly felt a piece of anger rising inside me, i didn't want him to date with anyone else, i just want him to myself. This didn't happen with his previous spouses.

What the fuck. I thought i killed these feelings.

I kept at this for a while until it got to the point where every minute or two it would happen again, until I was dripping in my own fluids. 

Now this was all very enjoyable, but I've read other people's descriptions of prostate orgasms, and I certainly didn't have one. I am doing the right thing?

I'm pretty socially awkward and shy in general, but nothing too extreme, and there's always a pretty good flow in conversation. Anyways, I'd ask them later if they wanted to meet up again, and no dice. They'd either come up with a series of excuses or just not reply all together. This would even happen when I was just trying to get a conversation going over text.

I'm 29, and just getting around to this whole coming out thing. I went to college close to home with most of my friends, so it was kind of hard to break that mold and come out. After college, I moved to a small town and got really involved in my work, so I never really made time for it. Long story short, I'm now 29, have started dating a little bit, and am ready to come out to my family. But there is a little bit of a complication.

I have told a few friends, but since I'm still in a small town, I'm kind of careful who I tell, what with the way people talk and all. That's not even my issue. My real issue is with my parents. My mom is kind of judgy, and wound't understand. Coming out would destroy our relationship in the short term, but I guess I'm prepared for that.  I've been taking my brothers temperature on the topic, and my sister-in-law's favorite aunt is gay, so he'll be fine.

However, my bigger issue is my father. Since I was 10 years old, I've been finding gay porn on my dad's computer. Also, being pretty savvy with computers and distressingly curious, I've been able to track him through gay chat rooms, and most recently, I've seen him on Grindr. I don't know that my dad is gay as well, but he's definitely got more than a fascination with the subject. I also know enough that he's at least talked about meeting guys, if not done a bit more. So, here's the issue - if I come out to my parents, I risk outing my dad in the process. The end result would be the destruction of my parents' marriage.

I've been considering putting something up for a long time. I don't have anyone else to talk to about these concerns I have, and this seems to be the right place for it. 
Mainly these are some of my more personal issues that, after thinking about them for as long as I have, I still don't have a good answer.

* I was diagnosed with a form of Autism when I was seven, and while I'm high functioning it still remains a part of me. So how would that come into play? Specifically: How long should I wait to tell a guy I'm interested in about this? I don't want to introduce myself as autistic, but I don't want a guy feeling like I tricked him into dating me for too long until I told him.
* I haven't had the best life. I had to move to a new Middle School due to abuse by some of the staff, went through a deep depression afterward that lasted all my teenage years (I'm 21 now), bullying from (mostly boys) at school which still makes it hard to trust guys my age, and I have a bit of a dysfunctional family (love them and all, but they are not healthy minded people). Another thing I'm wondering about when to tell anyone about it. I know how easy it is to fall into pitying yourself, and flinging the shit you've been though at anyone who'll listen. I've done pretty well at stopping myself from doing that, but again I don't want to wait too long.

* I'm still not certain if it's even worth it to come out. Like, I've practically decided to do it at one point, but (and I realize how spoilt I sound here) I feel like I've already gone through enough in life. Like, I've worked years and years finally be accepted as more than, ""That retard in special ed."" and now I'm worried that I'll lose everything I've worked for up to this point. I'm also worried that I'll be forced into a situation that I can't cope with (even though I'm familiar with confrontation) 'cause of bigots being bigots.

I was at a concert this past Monday, and I got pretty much sexually assaulted by two different chicks.  The first time, this girl walked in front of me and straight up grabbed me by the balls.  I shot her the dirtiest of looks and she quickly moved away into the crowd.  The second time some girl came up and just started dry humping me from the side.

I think the worst instance occurred at a different concert a while ago.  I'm a big raver so I was at a Knife Party concert at Terminal 5 in NYC and some 40 year old woman who was rolling on E kept trying to grind with me and wouldn't take no for an answer.  Eventually I had to run away through the crowd so she would leave me alone.  Needless to say, it was utterly horrifying.

Look, I love dancing as much as the next guy, but how about saying hi first before dry humping me to death.  Do any bros have any tips for chick repellent/a surefire way to get them off of you?  I know this sounds like such a bitchey, whiney, first-world problem, but it honestly annoys me a lot.

Here's the rub. Even though he likes having sex with me, he's really into the idea of having a third person into the mix.

We've both said our pieces and he's afraid that the third one might snag me or something so he is generally aversive to the idea of building a relationship with the third guy albeit a friendly one (which is awfully sweet, but c'mon, I like the idea of loving two persons who love each other as well).

I was never out in either scenario and moving literally a thousand miles away from home was a conscious decision for me to be able to live a little bit in the way I never had in my past. 

I've made a friend off grindr, he's a good guy and has been showing me around the scene here and I'm just completely boggled at how to behave in gay bars and such. I've always been a really stoic, controlled personality. Drinking doesn't make me uninhibited, it just makes me clumsy.

There is a 16 year age difference between us. I am 52, he is 36. Age isn't an issue between us.

He was diagnosed 2 years ago. Even though we have been together for almost 10 years and never practiced safe sex before we found out his status, for some reason I am negative. He is now undetectable. He contracted it before we met. We didn't test because we were monogamous.

5 years ago I cheated on him in a drunken stupor with a bi friend (no, it isn't an excuse). It meant nothing to me emotionally. We worked through it, or so I thought, to the stage we were married. I am completely committed to (emotionally and sexually), and supportive of him.

He is only now starting to tell family and friends he is +. But he has very low self esteem (even before HIV because of hiding he was gay) which has now brought our relationship to crisis. He has always run away from his problems in the past and now he has brought back my cheating as a reason to leave. He has said he can't trust me, even though I have moved heaven and earth in the past 5 years to prove I will never do it again. He also feels he ""didn't do enough to deserve getting HIV"" and now feels he wants to just leave and have as much random sex as he can. We're trying to work through this, I think.

He has been unemployed for the past 5 months and has had nothing to do but think, get stoned and dwell on the negatives of his situation. We live in the country so others with HIV for us to talk with are scarce, +/- couples even rarer. We have just taken the step of contact with an AIDS group in a local city.

I thought our relationship, although not perfect, was secure. Today he has enrolled in a 2 year college program in that city 1.5 hours away and will be living with a good female friend. I support it completely. I think it will be a way for him to gain confidence and give him the ability to gain some perspective. He partly thinks it's also a way to escape.

I believe it is his state of mind that is causing this to happen and not how he feels about me or what I did in the past. He says he loves me and doesn't ever want to not have me in his life. He wants his cake and to eat it too, in his words. He thinks counselling doesn't work. He tried it for his depression after being diagnosed. If you don't think it will work, it won't. So couples counselling is out right now.

I guess what I want is advice on what I can do to help keep our relationship together. Are there ways I'm not supporting or helping him that I could try? Are there things I should be saying or doing?

We are talking a lot now, but what he sees as problems seems to change every day. Today he is willing to give our marriage a shot, but that was only after I agreed we would discuss a relationship where we had the option of adding a third person to sex occasionally. In effect, he can sleep around, but we do it together, never alone. This is a huge change for me.

There is a lot of good in our relationship and I do know the feelings he is experiencing are common the first few years of diagnosis.

I want our marriage to work because I love him with all my heart. I know when he gets past this stage he will regret any rash decisions he has made due to self-loathing, shame and depression.

He has said that starting to tell people has made him feel better and more empowered.

It's 2 am and I can't even sleep. As always, I have too much in my mind. There's something that I didn't get to think until now. 

I've known I'm gay since I was a kid. Grew up lying about it (and I still am to a point). I'm 22 and I started developing depression when I was about 10. I grew up sad, angry and somewhat cold. I turned into the shy and awkward kid. I've always had a problem communicating and connecting with people. I just don't know how to describe it. It seems I've been good at hiding all this bad emotions because so far not many people see all this I have inside. 

I'm not good at making friends. I have this ""easiness""  to forget and just stop any connection to people. As of now. The only friend I have is my boyfriend . I don't even talk to anyone else other than my family (because family right?) and him. I've gotten used to being alone and feeling lonely. 

I'm out to some people that are not even in my life anymore. I'm out to my brother and sister (they both were ok with it). Not out to parents. 

I actually moved to the US to go to college, so I live with some relatives; parents live in a different country. So far, I was able to make some friends but I (being myself) just stopped talking to them. 

My depression got really bad last year. I was able to see a counselor at school but they told me I needed 'major' help. I never followed up with anything (I can't afford it and telling my parents or relatives would mean opening up and telling them I'm gay) . Right now (surprisingly) my depression is not as bad but I feel it still doesn't let me function properly. What do I know anyways, I've had this for over 10 years. I don't know better. 

Since I've grown so disconnected from people, I tend to separate myself from everyone. The other day,  a relative talking about me said he thinks I'll dissappear once I'm done with college. He doesn't see me sticking around. I didn't say nothing but it is somewhat true. I've always felt that once I'm more independent I'll just slowly cut communication with my family and everyone I once knew. 

So the question for all of you and that I hope you could help me with.

Is it fair that I do that to them? Is it fair that I relate them as a part of all the emotional pain when they don't even know how I'm feeling? I have a feeling that I'm being selfish. 

I've been thinking that if I ever comes out to them and they don't approve I will just move away and they'll  never hear from me. It's not that hard for me, I think. Since I moved out, I talk to them once in a while and it's because they contact me.


Sorry if this question bothers anyone or it seems stupid. I really am confused with what to do.

i'm a 30 yo guy - fairly 'straight' fella here.

i've had feelings for guys in the past (since i was ten probably), but i just thought they were ""good"" friends. never were the feelings of a sexual nature, until maybe college.  i'm now thirty and since about 22, i've realized that it's not just a phase, i'm interested in being with guys as well as girls.  i know ppl say this is a phase, before i truly come out as gay, but i seriously can have love/affection/lust/fulfillment for women and men.  i've only had one 'encounter' with a guy and while i was nervous, it also felt right.

so, i've got trouble reconciling my feelings.  i was brought up christian, so, it's taken me about 10 or 15 years of just shaking the stigma for me to even begin to 'be myself' and just let whatever happens, happen.

so, i'm not ashamed about being bi (or gay, if it ever turns that way - which i'm not sure nor do i care if it does), but i definitely am conflicted about how to ""come out"".  first reason being the ""bi"" thing and even some of the gay guys i've talked to / hung out with - have immediately dismissed me upon hearing i'm bi (how's that for annoying/childish/selfish?).  secondly, i guess, comes more into play due to my family situation, i'm a triplet and I know there will be a million questions from whoever i tell - how come i'm bi but my siblings aren't - blah blah blah.

the last part is - part of me feels like i'm lying because i'm NOT saying anything when people ask ""how come you're not back in the dating scene""/etc. (I was in a LTR with a girl for 5 years).  but the other half of me says ""eff it - why should i HAVE to come out?!?"" it's my life, if I want to be selective who i tell of IF i tell, i should be allowed to be.

thoughts/suggestions/etc.  so far, i can't even get up the nerve to tell my TWO best friends, let alone my family.  although, i've thought about it for a long time.  i know coming out isn't easy - and i've literally now spent years grappling with the thought of it.

Basically, I just can't to seem to control my emotions at all. I'm currently 17. The first guy I liked (at 15) - I Facebook stalked him and basically became some obsessive delusional person during that period of time. Not to mention it showed through social media (due to my inability to keep my mouth shut), which caused me to become 'infamous' per se. Worse off the school I was in was really homophobic overall, and the guy in question was some devout religious douche. (no offence, but that's how I would describe him) 

I thought that was over, that phase of me, that I could learn to be more mature and not rash in my decisions, in a new school. But no it seems that I will never learn. 

Recently I noticed this guy in my school which is my type to a T, stocky, with a muscular profile and cute to boot. We've talked before, but no more than a few passing sentences. I discovered his ask.fm, which basically is the trend for teenagers it seems nowadays to have a platform to answer questions that anonymous people can ask them. Basically we talked on ask.fm for awhile, and it was nice. But one thing led to another, and it led him to figure out my identity. Basically it became awkward after that whenever we crossed paths in school because it was clear I had a major crush on him. I still continued to use the site as a ways to interact with him though, until I slipped.. once again, [here.](http://imgur.com/y5LtIpP) sigh. 





Anyway, I'm rambling. To the main point of why I am writing this. I feel like I can't control my feelings for people, and that I'm too open about what I do about such stuff that should be private.. Also I feel that I'm a drooling pervert to this people because of my actions that are just way creepy..

One of us just didn't ask the other out again or we pretended that nothing more than friendship had ever occurred between us. 

I met this guy on OKCupid and we have been seeing each other for about 2 months. We really hit things off on our first date but after that night every time we went out his roommate and the girl she was dating would always end up with us at some point. It was fine at first but when he started asking me to stay over after I got off work (because of our conflicting schedules not allowing us much date time) I would show up and we would just sit there talking to them until he had to go to bed for work. Any time we would go out for dinner they would be there, every time I would come over to catch up we would just sit and talk with the girls and it was ALWAYS their inside jokes I had to have explained to me.

He would never come to my apartment because he doesn't want to come to Brooklyn and about 2 weeks ago his sister came into town and although he is older than I am he isn't out to his family so we didn't talk for the duration of her visit. After that I stopped sleeping over. I had to have surgery this past week because I've been sick but he texted me the day before asking me if we could actually hang out when I recovered or if I was just blowing him off, I wasn't intending to at the time but in the past few days as I've been recovering I realized I may have been...

There is another guy I know who I've been talking to recently but mostly I just hate how boring the relationship got so quickly and I really disliked how much he told me I would have to work to get his friend's approval and then when I had been ""approved"" we were never alone together unless he wanted to fool around. 

I know I don't see a future with this guy, there are just too many things about him I'm not for, so, basically what I'm asking is how do I let this guy know that I'm not interested anymore? We met online so can I just text him and say how I feel or do I have to risk us hanging out and breaking up with all 3 of them at once?

The thing is I have a hard time meeting guys I'm compatible with that I find both mentally and physically attractive.

I'm not a sports guy, I'm way to clumsy for that. I used to make and effort and play volley ball in the park with friends, but like I said I'm clumsy so it often ended poorly for me. I also don't like watching sports, I don't even watch the Super Bowl, the Play Offs, or the World Series. I get exposed to World Cup coverage, but that's because I come from a family of soccer nuts and it would be hard to avoid. 

I'm also not a fan of what I would consider trash TV. I don't Like reality TV. I don't watch any show of the format ""America's Blankiest Blank"", nor do I care what ""The Real Morons of Who Gives a Fuck"" are up to. 

I don't' watch Drag Race. I know precisely one song by Rihanna  because it was featured in Wreck it Ralph, and I can't stand going to night clubs.

Whenever a guy starts talking about any of the above topics, be it sports or for lack of a better descriptor the interests of your average 14 year old girl, I can feel myself losing interest in him. 

On top of that I've made a point not to hide the fact that I'm a total geek. I like what I like, and I don't feel the need to apologize for it.

 I tend to carry on at length about comics and movies and the parts of nerd culture that make me happy. Even on a first date it's not unusual for me to tell and anecdote that involves my love of Twilight Sparkle or a quote from Adventure Time. I don't try to bring these things up, but if you ask me what I did today and I spent the day watching Young Justice and Bravest Warriors on my computer I'm not going to lie just to save face. 

I also like doing physical activities that don't require high levels of coordination, but are still physically demanding. I spend most of the summer in the pool, I go on 3-5 mile long hikes and I like to ski and.. well you get the picture. I'd like to have a partner that can join in those activities as well. 


I know it's hypocritical of me to judge guys based on their interests, after all  I don't want someone looking down on me for playing nerdy table top games. I just can't help it. I tend to find that if someone can't keep up with me mentally I lose interest in their company rather quickly. And if a guy can't keep up physically I tend to stop calling them too.

I'm not saying I'm a perfect 10, and I'm not saying I want a guy who is. I realize that there are not many mountaineering well read otaku out there. I just don't want to settle.  

So, what do you you guys say? Am I a judgmental douche bag? Am i perpetually single because I have unrealistic standards? Should I just settle for either brains or brawn and quit insisting on both?

My goal is to move out and find a place to live somewhere that isn't here, I'm not sure where would be best to go for a lonely gay guy like me but I've so far considered going to either Newcastle or Edinburgh since they're both close to home.

Let's start with location, location, location. I'm not terribly bothered where I move to, all I want from the city are places that offer plenty of entertainment and a great LGBT community where I can meet plenty of other people like myself (I don't have many gay friends, or friends in general at the moment) but is still affordable to live in. 

I only have a part time job in a supermarket at the moment and I'd like to get another job but in the city I'll be moving to. The problem with the job part is that I have no idea what kind of job I'd rather do and I have very little experience apart from six years worth of Customer Service, I don't really want to go back to a job like my current one because I'm absolutly miserable there. I'm not sure if there are places that can train me up and give me a job doing something completely different and unrelated to what I'm doing now, I've always wondered how people go from one job to another that's completely unrelated to each other and with little experience.

This is very important to me because my current situation is making me majorly depressed; I've been single for a long time and get no attention from other men, I have very few friends  so I don't often hang around with anyone and my job is making me even more miserable for various reasons.

**TL;DR:** Want to move to a new city but have little job experience and very limited funds, my current situation is making me miserable and desperately need out.

I am here again in need for advice. **I** actually **am** sorry for this so-fucking-long post(800 words), but i have nowhere else to ask for this advice, my only friend that I could talk about this, does not even know all details yet, because I don’t want to impose this burden on her in one take.   
Tl;dr: After we had our [epic night together](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1gkzkv/first_time_i_was_and_got_cuddled_got_raging_boner/) he has been reserved for me super~~(is this a thing in English language / can I say it like that?)~~ and seems like he does not want to tell me something straight, or simply - anything.  
  
Longer version(actually really long one..):  
We had our night together a month ago. From that day we have not met. He said that he has all this *job thing to do*, in which i have no doubt, i trust him with that, but it has been a month. He has said that he has to do a lot of others stuffs, like, hang out with friends, go to official or other parties, like, friends birthdays etc. Then he had to spend day with sisters children, something like nanny I assume. That is okay but then he has mentioned that he had free day where he just drove to beach with sister just like that. I was not pleased, because i have mentioned like it has been – I really want to see him, I want to talk with him. .. Mkay.. Then he had this vacation *thing* more like camp he had to be on, that is fine by me too, but today, as i am assuming, he is back from this camp and when in *facebook type thing*, that we have in our country, i asked him simple question like „Hi! :) How was it, was it interesting?” and he just answered in the lines of „umm it was really really good!”. And that’s it. Before our night he usually replayed with question *a long the lines of* how was „your days? What did you do?” or something. He usually used smileys too..before.. before that night we both were in „same position” in ‘who will start conversation’, now it’s all about me, i have to make him to contact with me, and he mostly even don't really reply, just sends me some kinda message and that is it. Phone messages are useless now, he does not even respond to those..  
The worst thing – once a week we have this skype convo’ that I start (obviously) and he mentions things that I want to have, like – I started serious-type conversation about how I really want to(more like with subtext – need to) talk with him eye to eye, in real life not in social portals or over messages in phone, and he answered with „eye to eye.. hand on hand. Like that, right?” and then I melt and have this feeling „oh, he still likes me..! All hope is restored!”. Seems like he is doing that with intention to keep me alive just for a little but more; like not completely killing, but slowly taking away my oxygen and then pumps me with it once a week so I don’t die.  
Another thing ~~(I am sorry if someone reads this and is bored!)~~. He easily drives to beach, to places, he even mentioned that he likes to drive just some blocks from home to shop rather than walking, just because he can and here comes this thing – he would not drive to me when he would want to (he has implied twice or three times that he would „now” drove to me in middle of night) but after a while says that he is not going to and one if his reasons(only one that he has told to me) is that it costs him about 10$ one way (that would be converting money, I don’t live un USA).  
Are my explanations rational – he is actually pumping me with oxygen once a week so I would not completely die or i am just over-thinking this too much because of affection i got from *that night*?  
P.S. Week after that night I had this thing that we have in our country – name day, it’s some kind similar to birthday, but to a name you have. And he did not congratulate me, not like I really celebrate that day, but I really wanted only his congrats that he did not deliver not even after a week when we had a chat in skype.  
P.S.S. – I have acknowledged that I was too into-it-all at first, as it was my first experience in this kind of relationships. I have detached a bit and acknowledged that I have to lower my expectations as low as possible, but still, he has not met even those like meeting me in real life just for 30 minutes. Neither do i write to him every day, I usually write to him once every two-three days, when I want to.

I am all about fooling around, however I work M-F 9am - 6pm as a manager of an apartment complex so when I get home I want to cook dinner relax and enjoy my evening.
A perfect example of this problem would be last night. He works in health care so he had work until 11 pm last night so when I got off I came home made myself some dinner and started watching TV. Around 8 or so I fell asleep on the couch and didn't wake up until around 10. When he finally got off work he came over and joined me on the couch. Well with him there and me still being tired I fell back asleep while a movie was on. He woke me up around midnight and told me to go to bed. Once we were in bed he started to let his hands roam and since I was so tired I told him I wasn't in the mood and needed to rest up for work tomorrow. This morning he had to work the morning shift so he was up rather early. While he was getting ready I could just tell he was in a weird mood and was mad at me which leads me to believe it was because I didn't participate in last nights activities.
All of this leads me to the question: How often do you and your partner get intimate together? I'd say we have sex 1-2 times a week and then fool around 2-3 times a week. Is this ok or am I not participating enough? I love this man to death and really want this relationship to work out so I am willing to do whatever it takes.

But he sort of feels kinda guilty afterwards, because he never wants to be a top anymore.. I don't know why, because sex is really great.. Not just for me.. He really likes bottoming for me.. But after sex, he feels kinda guilty for not wanting to top me.. That doesn't bother me at all, but it is affecting him somehow. And I'm afraid it could spoil our relationship.

I preach about body acceptance and self-love, but I'm not attracted to overweight people (I do *love* a cuddly belly though ;P) and I could never date someone who was obese because I'm vegan, I workout daily, and I take a very holistic and preventative outlook on my health/lifestyle. I don't care about abs or muscles, just health. Although I tend to be attracted to bodies like the Bodybuilder Matt Sallis. I also tend to only like men who are at least 6'.  
  
I say there's nothing wrong with fems and I get angry at men here who berate them, but I am only attracted to masculine men. I also rejected someone on grindr last night because his eyebrows were so tweezers that they looked like one pencil stroke over each eye.  
  
I treat every person with respect and have done lots of volunteer work, but I can't date someone who is unintelligent, uneducated, or poor because of laziness (certain circumstances I completely understand).  
  
Also...although I say size doesn't matter and I'm actually average myself, I love huge dicks. But a smaller dick wouldn't actually turn me off in a relationship and I would get just as much pleasure from a smaller one. But they just look/feel powerful. I was raised on porn, so this is probably why...  
  
Can I not help what I'm attracted to or am I just another sheep following the herd? I feel like a bad person... :(

I have no pics of my self on Facebook so this was a bit unusual. we chat for a few hours, decide to hang out and work on some cosplays together. We set a date, awesome.
So we continue to chat for a few days and find we click on almost every level with the exception that I dont drink or smoke. we send face pics and compliments (no perv pics boys), and we start to like each other. or so i was told anyways. we eventually decided wed turn the hang out into a real date. the night before, just before we went to bed he told me ""if we click this well in person id be willing to do anything to make this work"", in reference to he lives about an hours drive away. granted I shouldnt have read too much into it and it did move a bit quick but i replied in the same manner.

Next was the date. usual stuff, hanging out, went out to eat, caught a movie (how horribly cliche), and over all had a great time. Now there where some awkward quiet moments through out the day (maybe 3 or 4) but I thought it went really well over all. we shared some stories on the way back to my place to get him directions home, hugged, and saw each other off.

more than a few hours later i get a message close to midnight from him saying he enjoyed the day and would love to do it again, but he feels we should just stay friends. he says its the drive and the fact that he doesnt work, and as a result cant pay for gas or dates (though i paid for everything that day, not that it was a bad thing), and we should just befriends until were both in ""a better financial state to do so (date)"". Id love to just stay friends as thats what i was looking for to begin with, we just happened to click, but i cant help but feel that getting this response after ""id do anything to make it work"" that i somehow fucked up somewhere during the day?

Exodus international has been the number go-to resource for pastors, parents, and others who have a person in their life who thinks they might be gay. Exodus would hold yearly conferences, as well as fund local satalite ministries to set up counseling and therapy sessions. Since the 1970's they have asserted that THEY COULD HELP A PERSON WHO IS GAY BECOME STRAIGHT AGAIN. I myself was once guided to their ministry but luckily didn't get involved because I didn't support their ideas. They have been known to not only propagate anti-gay sentiments around the world but have also been accused of eltro shop thearpy and other now commonly denounced practices in the psychology world. Even with this torrid past, up until this year, they were still considered the default ministry for churches worried about someones sexual prefrances. 

Well just this past week Alan Chambers the president of Exodus International announced that the organization would be shutting down. This came after he publically apologized to the LGBT community for the pain and lies perpetrated by his organization. In a recent episode of Our America on the OWN network, a group of former Exodus survivors as well as Mr. Chambers and his wife, had a candid conversation about the group and its future.

About two months ago I began exploring what it's like to be gay. I knew for awhile, but I came to a point where I couldn't stand not telling anyone. I started by telling my best friend. He said it made no difference to him, to my relief. Ever since then we haven't spoken that much though, and it's made me reluctant to tell anyone else.

After a few weeks of feeling miserable, I asked him if he was sure it made no difference. He assured me it didn't, he just has a lot going on with school and preparing for an MCAT. And that's fine, I know he's being honest. But I wish he would at least take a minute to see how I'm doing... It was hard telling him, and I really need some kind of support. The problem now is I don't have anyone to talk to about everything I'm going through.

I'm upset that I won't be able to have kids on my own. That my parents won't get to meet any grandkids from me, and tell them which parent or which of my sisters or cousins they resemble most. That I'm afraid to even tell my parents who I am until I'm financially secure, even though they tell me how proud they are of the man I've become. That a good friend made the effort to set me up with a really beautiful, fun girl whose number I'll probably never call. That I shamelessly went home with a few guys out of loneliness to see what it was like, and I still feel guilty about it. And finally, that I'm not sure I'll ever find the right guy because I don't know where or how to look.

It's all I can do not to just go to my room and bawl my eyes out. Meanwhile  I'm stuck at my parents' house watching my sister while they're out of town, I have a test on Monday and two papers to write, and it's raining outside.

Do we all go through this? How do you rise above it and learn to be happy? I'd really appreciate any advice or encouragement you guys have to offer.

As we're in the midst of Pride month, I was hoping we could enter into a dialogue about advice, Reddit, and life.

On a typical day, I'd just blow it off and ignore them, but today, I'm ticked and ready for a full on diatribe. Below is the PM I sent them. Let me know if I acted out of line/turn. 

*I was wondering why you needed a throw away account if you were going to post something on your ""real"" account with the same premise? Did you not get the answer you were looking for, or, just looking for sympathy? As a gaybro, I hope that you answer this as honestly and directly as you could.* 

*On a related note, by reading your post, you're looking for someone to just say ""break-up with your boyfriend because he's a tease and doesn't want to have as much sex with you"". My response, as with all my friends who play these games is this: you already know the answer to your own question before you even ask it (questions relating to your relationship). I guess this is also presuming that you have a boyfriend and that you, yourself, are a gaybro.* 

*In addition, I think that this username is also a throwaway account, so if you don't respond to this or read this, know that some people read people's post and generally try and give their best advice and true life stories.

Well, here I am again, potentially over analyzing shit once more. I was here before bugging out between dates one and two about not having heard from this older gent (20 year difference) I've been seeing, but it turned out I was just being a bit of a dipshit and things went ahead as planned. And they went pretty well, eventually planning to have a third date, with somewhat regular contact in between.

On our third date (last Friday) we also had a good time. Spent a good while talking, eventually got down to sexy times (really hot and passionate) and cuddling, chatting, then we went out to eat. I had to be somewhere the next day, so there was relative disappointment on his end as he expected me to spend the night. He drove me home, chatting and laughing along the way. When we were finally outside of my house, we kissed, he told me ""we'd talk"", and I went inside. However, before heading inside, I asked if it would be alright to call him at some point, to which he replied ""you can call me at anytime, you wouldn't be bugging me"". Cool stuff, dude.

I got a text the following night from him asking how my thing went (a family event of sorts). He's a bit short on texts and email, so we had a brief exchange. It struck me as thoughtful, though, and was relatively reassuring. The next time I'd hear from him would be this past Monday. He had a thing to go to that night, career related, so I sent him a text early afternoon saying ""Hey, have fun at your shindig. Maybe I can call you later?"", to which he replied ""Thank You."" and nothing else. I found it odd, figured he's busy, and left it alone.

Wednesday night I tried calling him around 8:30-9:00 (once), but no answer. I left a brief message (""Hey, how was your thing, how are you, talk to you later"") and that's been it, no calls, no texts, no emails. I'm not quite sure what to do from here, how to initiate contact and set up a fourth date, or if I even should at this point. I guess the last text makes me feel a bit...less hopeful that things are cool there.

Someone asked me in my previous thread if I'm expecting a constant stream of telegrams, and the answer is no, I suppose not, but I guess I'm just not used to guys maintaining radio silence and being relatively weird outside of dates (and it's easy to over analyze shit for me). I'm probably freaking out long before the point where most normal people would freak out. Some people, this gent included, aren't so jazzed about phone calls, texts, emails, and I'm trying to maintain a certain level of respect for that, but it kind of throws me for a loop when you consider that everyone I've dated and have shown an interest in maintain a fairly regular stream of contact. It presents a clear conflict for me internally, because I start to analyze why I'm so distraught over no contact, who this guy is to me and why I am seemingly desperate, despite the fact that I want to move slower than I have in the past and feel things out. I'm not looking to call this dude, or anyone, my boyfriend anytime soon. With that being said, I do know I want to see him again and explore that realm of possibility, and the idea that I might not be able to is just fucking me up a bit, I suppose.

When we are together, we have a great time, share a shit load of different things with each other, connecting over music, art, movies, esoteric/occult stuff, and I genuinely enjoy being around him. It would seem the feeling is (or was) mutual, so I'm thrown for a loop. I do find him interesting and somewhat worth pursuing, but I know no guy is worth all of your dignity. If I realize it's going nowhere fast and I'm just being dicked around, I'm going to say ""well, I tried. Fuck this"".

I guess I'm wondering, from an outsider perspective, if I should wait to hear from this turkey, send a simple email at some point, or just leave it. I'm painfully clueless with this crap. People say to follow your gut. Well, my gut says send an e-mail. Say ""Hey, I called you the other night. Wanted to see if you were down for hanging out next weekend. Let me know."" and keep it simple. No response? You have your answer, fucking get over it, listen to Theologian and use the subsequent anxiety to make artwork. Positive response? He was just busy and you're making mountains out of ant hills, would probably do well to relax about it in the future with this guy and others, go listen to Theologian, use the subsequent anxiety to make artwork.

I've never been on an antidepressant before infact, until now I'd never felt depressed in my 27 years of life.  


It seems one immediate side effect is that it's already affected my ability to orgasm.  I tried tonight, for like 40 mins and while I was mostly hard I just couldn't get there.  I gave up, went and had a shower and while in there, decided to add a bit more and um, slip a finger in at the same time and then I was enjoying the happiness of an orgasm in a matter of minutes.


The latter part is great, but I don't want to be stuck having to rely on that every single time.  The doctor has given me three months worth and if this isn't just a temporary thing while my body adjusts then I think not being able to get to an orgasm (and especially embarrassing when I'm with my guy) isn't a good trade off and may just go back to toughing out the issues without the drug.

Important parts in following paragraphs. I'm 20, a bibro, and I've been single since last Summer (a year ago). Last fall I tried hook-ups for the first time. I found out that I'm not a really a fan of anonymous sex myself, so my experience in that area (FWB/NSA) is extremely limited.

OKAY so the story: I went to a multi-band concert and met two 40-year old guys with whom I made casual, non-sexual, non-charged conversation in between sets (we mostly talked about Dungeons and Dragons). I find out towards the end of the night that they're gay, have been partners for 6 years, and live in my same super-conservative neighbourhood. I'm like, ""Sweet, I have gay mentors!"" We exchange email addresses and part ways.

A week later after casual emailing, they proposition me for a 3-way. I have no idea what to do. On one hand, I do find them both attractive, and they find me attractive, and I've had fantasies about 3-ways. On the other, they're twice my age. That doesn't really bother me, but some part of me thinks it should. Plus, I'm worried that if I engage in a sexual relationship with them, I won't be able to have a mentor relationship with them (though they assure me this isn't the case). They haven't pressured me one way or another, but I'm still very confused about it. Help, Gaybros!

Its weird sometimes when you feel like you don't have anyone to talk to about what is going on with your love life.  I dragged a friend out for a pint, but we barely touched the subject.
This is the situation in short and why I need advice:
I've been in a relationship for a year and a half.  While celebrating our year and a half anniversary last weekend, we finished off the night with a lot of sangria. While cuddling and watching a stand-up show I took his cell phone to change his wallpaper to a cheesey picture of us.  As soon as the phone turned on his email was loaded open and had three (or more?!) emails from Man Hunt.
Now we don't have an open relationship.  He cheated once a year ago and we moved past it.
I chose not to freak out and ruin the night, but couldn't sleep all night and ended up going to sleep on the couch.  Today I finally asked him about it.  I was calm.  He freaked out on me and told me I knew he was polygamous but was trying to be committed to me and deleted the account right away and did nothing.  I believe him.
The reason I am bothered by this is because he went behind my back and went through with the thoughts and actions instead of talking to me about how he feels and what he needs.  It's not what he NEEDS, but how he was going about it.  That makes me really up set.
I'm torn about what to do.  I love him.  He loves me and says he does and I believe him.  He just wants his cake and wants to eat it too (weird saying I think).  
I feel like we worked hard to build trust back into the relationship only for him to bring drama to us and take away all that trust and what we have.  
Am I over reacting or not?
I can only see two options:  Ending the relationship, or having threesomes with him.  
I just feel like I've gotten threesomes out of my system when I was 19 and he's had them too so its not about him wanting to try something new.
I'm not sure what to do.  I don't expect someone to be a 100% sexual match and I get that all relationships have compromises.  But what do I compromise and when is that crossing the line?

I know this probably gets asked quite a bit, but idk, everyone's case is different, so hopefully you can bear with me.  I'm vers, and I love bottoming, but I've been having trouble with digestion/regularity so it's making the chances of a mess a lot more of a gamble than I'd like.  

I heard about taking metamucil, so a few months ago I tried taking a generic CVS orange powder equivalent to it, and for awhile, I was taking the best shits of my life.  Recently though, my stool has been a lot less consistent, and I haven't had a good hard, well-clumped stool in at least a month.  I've gotten to the point where I'm trying to take things out of my diet to see if they are causing the problem.  I initially took out aspartame (which was in a drink at my dining hall), and then coffee (cup a day), and I try to grab fruits and vegetables wherever they're available.  I'm about to try switching back to regular milk from soy milk (absolutely no reason why I drink it, I'm neither vegan or lactose intolerant), but at that point I don't know what else I'll do.  

I was initially taking about a lumped-teaspoon of fiber powder twice a day with water, and I *thought* perhaps I had ramped it up too much, so I cut back some, and tried taking it *after* meals (supposedly it also can speeds up the rate at which food travels through the digestive track too much) to allow food to digest first before clumping, and that hasn't helped either.  

Anyone have any ideas?  Regardless of whether I bottom ever again or not, I'm really not enjoying having my stomach rumbling and getting extra gaseous right before I have to go take a sub-par poop.

  I am 25 yrs old and going to MATC for liberal arts transfer.  One of the classes I've chosen *posted on the title* is dance class.  Now as in class I notice that my gay dar has gone haywire on some of these guys, but one guy in particular I cant guess him out.  One reason being that he always dances with this one girl in class, so I assumed they were together.  

  With that in mind I try to enjoy the eye candy as much as I can but later I notice he has thrown some looks at my general direction, mostly smiling.  *note: I didn't stare at him*.  When I look back as he stares at me, he looks away.  At this point I'm confused/doubtful because I had a lot of experiences were I attracted people that I was NEVER attracted to.  So attracting a guy I am also attracted to feels very foreign for me D:  
  
  Now some progress news with this.  As I was putting on my shoes after class I notice he was waiting discreetly.  As they were on started to walk outside, interestingly enough, so was he.  I did muscle up the courage to go up and talk to him and with this convo I later learn that the girl is just a high school friend.  That sparked my spirits and hope to pursue this guy. 
 
 I stutter a bit after I found out that info, show my dorky side, but we talk for a little bit and asked for his name.  Got his name and from there, part ways.  I found out he is into snowboarding *and has the body to show it*  so I am hoping to use this for my next convo with him. 

 Now to finish this off. *thanks for the people that have read down to this point*  The problem I have is, I have been very introverted most of my life and I feel like I have missed a lot of life lessons because of it.  I'm not sure if this guy is being friendly or interested in me.  I am afraid of assuming the worse, but for the first time in years, I've had my heart pounding for another guy.  He is totally my type, cute, silly carefree and comes out to me as very adorable.  I don't want to mess up this if this would spawn a friendship or more.

  So I come to you guys for some feed back on the situation, I really could use some.  Please......

His response was that he knew I was crushing on him and to work on it and not make a pass at him. We've been really close friends for the past five years and I've had a crush since day one.

Fast forward to today, I'm seeing a therapist, especially since we work together and therefore spend an insane amount of time together. During this morning's appointment the therapist points out that little if any progress has been made, but that he wasn't expecting me to perform magic either.

This Saturday it's his birthday, a day that is usually spent around our friends (we share the same circle of friends) at a bar or house party. It also happens to be the close to the birthday of another member of said circle. Therefore we do one party for both. I was excited about said party, it was to be followed with a trip to Daytona beach on Sunday with everyone.

However when discussing Saturday plans with him, he starts to talk nervously and says that I am not welcome to go to the Saturday event because someone will be there that doesn't want to see me. However, I am still invited, and welcome at the Sunday event. He later explains that a previous friend of mine, who is also gay and now hates me (because I told his bf that he was cheating) will be attending the Saturday activities. Mind you this person doesn't know anyone in our circle of friends whose only ties with my friend is that he works with said friend's wife. This person never talks to or hangs out with my friend, but somehow his appearance at said party takes precedent over me.

I was quite shocked, especially since I had not heard of this ex-friend of mine's name in quite some time. I try to play it cool, but I just become quiet until its time to leave work (15 mins). This time was filled with ""are you mad"" and ""why are you so quiet"" remarks, which only made the situation worse. Needless to say that I was a tear filled 25 minute drive home.

During said drive I reflected on my life and I now just feel lonely. Our shared circle of friends was actually his circle of friends that I was brought into when my friend and I began to hang out, therefore they are mostly his. I was always the +1, after his wife, to any hangouts with friends. I have no friends outside said group. I am trying to desperately distance myself from him, as I feel like I will no matter the outcome end being hurt and emotionally drained. To add insuly to injury, we work together, in the same office, 40 hours a week. I also don't have a boyfriend, or any significant other, and it's not because of a lack of trying. I have very little in common with my family and although i still live at home, i dont usually do anything with my parents or sibblings. In other words, I'm alone. I don't know what to do. I'm horrible at making friends, and my attempts at dating and looking for people online remind me of [early NASA rocket launches](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13qeX98tAS8&amp;sns=em), so now I'm looking for advice. I'd love to pick up and be in a new job on Monday, and have a new set of friends, possibly someone to date, but realistically I know that's not going to happen.

The fight is the same every time. This is the 5th or 6th time and each time it gets worse. Here's what we fight about.

I used to own a house. After 3months he moved in to help me pay my mortgage which I was having a hard time paying alone. I also had my younger brother living with me who I was helping get on his feet. Times got too tough and he was stressed because it was not a good location for his work. I decided to sell the house and we started looking for a new place together.

During this time we went to a BOH concert and got into a fight. He was upset because he had some kind of expectation of the night which I didn't live up to. Then he said he wasn't sure if he was right for me. This comment changed everything. I freaked out and could not commit to living with someone if they feel this way. When I met him he was living with his ex and I saw how crazy and awkward it was. I was not going to be in that situation. I told him 3 days later we needed to find separate places but I still wanted to be with him. He did not take it well but came around and got his own place and I moved in with some friends.

My boyfriend drinks, a lot. He drinks everyday. I like to drink too and drink with him but he doesn't know when enough is enough. This is when he get's mouthy and upset and starts going off on me. He yelled at me last night he's bitter about me ""kicking him out"" even though I explained why. Moreso he's tells me now he's upset more that I live with my friends which to me is irrelevant.

As I've said each time we have this fight it gets worse. Every time he's said the same thing. ""I love you but I don't know if I'm right for you. I don't have to be with you. I'm an awesome person and can find someone else."" I find this ironic since not 5min later he was crying saying he was never gonna find someone and be alone forever and that every relationship has been a waste for him and he has nothing to show for it. I find this to be self-loathing and pathetic and I feel sorry for him.

To me if you're right for someone you'd never say this, especially every time there's a fight. Last night it even broke down to we should have broke up when I sold my house and we moved out.

After the fight I had to drive him home back to my place since we carpooled. He was shitfaced but was smart enough to know not to drive. I let him stay at my place but I should have slept on the couch. Early morning he was half-crying saying how sorry he was and he loves me etc etc. It gets a little creepy to me too because he's like, ""I'm sorry baby. I love you with all my heart. Please hug me, please kiss me, say something nice to me"". It's the same story every time that it's predictable. I don't even know how to reply to this and I can't stand it. 

I'm fairly certain in my heart I need to break it off even though I don't want to. I do love him a lot and I get sad thinking of living without him in my life. I'm afraid of continuing to ""try"" however when I know it never changes or gets better. I try to keep confident and think someone is out there for me. I had hoped it was him. I'm afraid I'll regret breaking up with him and passing up someone that I know does love me.

I forgot to mention I'm meeting him tonight to ""talk"".

1364810992.0,10,self.askgaybros,1bewxx,I found out this weekend that my BF has quite the slutty past- and he has slept with most of his friends. Halp.,throwawaygay87,11,1,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1bewxx/i_found_out_this_weekend_that_my_bf_has_quite_the/,"Hey Bros,

I have been dating this wonderful guy for a month now, and we recently decided to be exclusive.  We have actually known each other for about 5 years, but we haven't connected until now.  Anyway, I found out this past weekend (he told me) that of his three close male friends, he has been in a longterm relationship with 1, he has drunkenly made-out with one, and he has slept with and dated his current roommate.  Most of this went down several months ago, and he has been close friends with them ever since.  They all see each other about 4 times a week.

I am a bit old-fashioned, and sex is a huge deal to me.  However, he recently told me that he did not see sex so much as an emotional expression, but rather a really fun activity (he has also frequented in more 1-night stands than he can count, always being safe, of course).  I don't look down own that sort of thing, but that assessment has undermined the intimacy that we currently have and is now really challenging my worldview of the relationship.  I have also met these friends, and as someone who does not have casual sex, I find it extremely awkward to meet his old sexual partners.

So my question is this- has anyone been in this situation before?  How do you deal with meeting lovers past and knowing that he has friendship-love but not romantic-love for them?

**TL/DR:  My new BF has a slutty past with his friends, and I am a really traditional dude who finds it awkward.  Halp!**

**Edit/Clarification**
The term ""slut"" I now regret using.  That was his word, not mine, and I will ask him to refrain from using it as it does undermine our intimacy just a tiny bit.  I like to think I don't look down on him, but I am sure there is something deep inside of me that does, so I'm going to soul search a bit.  Feel free to add to my comments or offer any more insight.

I wore a pink and purple polo with a navy blue cardigan to a buddy's house. His words were along the lines of ""so I think this is the first sign that you're going full-blown gay?""

We used to joke that ""at least Greg isn't one of the over-the-top gays"". It was funny to begin with, but with new wardrobe, and new clothes, and lost weight and some confidence, I'm eager to try dating. Talking about it with my straight besties gets mixed responses - one is very cool and an ally, the other gets uncomfortable and doesn't like to bring it up. I just asked him if he'd think less of me if I hooked up via grindr or a4a (as I'm a virgin and living in the midwest, it's a bit hard to put myself out there successfully), and he never responded.

Shit's been pissing me off. I'm not a fucking femme because I'm wearing pink you fucking idiot. And it's cool that I can't talk to my friends about shit like hookups without them getting weirded out?

Now, I'm really starting to regret this as my friends now encourage me to talk to my parents about it. Telling my parents is all I ever think about now.

A bit of background: when I was about 12 (I'm 19 now), I started looking a pictures of guys online — not exactly naked, but still quite suggestive. I was raised to think homosexuality was wrong and gross, but I didn't equate what I was looking at online to homosexuality. In high school, guys never really caught my eye, but I knew I wasn't sexually attracted to girls — at the time, I played that off as my ""Christian values to respect women"" (I'm no longer a Christian btw). There were a few girls that I knew were interested in me but I was never interested in them. I had sex with a friend (girl) just to say I lost my virginity, but I had a difficult time keeping it up and couldn't finish.

After graduating high school and become more independent, my attraction to guys started to increase. I drunkenly admitted to a gay friend of mine that I wasn't quite sure about my sexuality and asked if I could cuddle with him. For some reason, I still didn't really think I was gay because I was just drunk, but I think in this case the booze brought out the truth. Then the *actual* gay porn started to intrigue me, and I was very easily turned on by it. I started crushing on male celebrities. I started looking at guys and noticing little things, like how I was attracted to a guy by the way he carries himself in addition to appearance. I'm crushing on a few guys that I know are gay. I have a strong desire to kiss, hold hands, cuddle, and have sex with a dude. Pretty much the entirety of homosexuality, right?

My mind is pretty messed up though. Sometimes I think that once I started noticing my attraction to guys, I played along with it and my feelings are inauthentic. Or that I just do it for the attention. I'm worried that if I told my parents, I might be lying. Or that this whole thing will blow over and leave me in an awkward place with everyone I've told I'm gay. There's been a few clues since puberty that I've mentioned, but most of my feelings arose just in the last year.

How can I stop these doubts?

I don't know why im sad. He took it very well I suppose. He smiled a lot and kept acting as nice and awesome as always.

However, I came out right before we were supposed to both go home, and shortly after there were other people with us who didn't know. So... we didn't really get to actually talk about it.

Other bits of information:

* In the week since I've told him, it's quite obvious that he doesn't think anything bad about it because he's been acting basically the same.

* We work together so I see him basically everyday and normally also at least once every weekend.

* I have a major crush on him, but I already have a boyfriend so I definitely do not want a relationship with him, I want to keep the whole thing platonic I guess. I'm not even sure if it would be fair to call it a crush, he is just the coolest most awesome guy I've met in a very long time, and I know for a fact that the feeling is mutual (at least up to recently, hopefully also after my coming out).

Here are the problems:

* We are so similar and because of many little things I truly thought he was bi. But he hasn't told me anything so... I must now assume he isn't (or doesn't want to embrace that side). It's a bit dissapointing but obviously this isn't why I'm sad, I love him as a person regardless.

* We used to always flirt, flatter each other and be touchy feely with one another. Now that he knows I'm gay I feel uncomfortable doing any of this because the last thing I would want is for him to feel uncomfortable around me. It's almost as if him not knowing my sexual orientation gave us a layer of protection that meant whatever we said or did was OK because we were just really good friends. Well, this layer of protection isn't there anymore...

* Now I am overanalizing and overthinking every single thing he does or says to try to see if anything has changed or not. I now always feel a bit nervous because I conciously try to act the same as always. I am normally a funny person around him and this is making be quite the opposite lately.

* I have never told this to someone I care so much about... and now that I did I somehow feel clingy, like I was expecting us not to be the same, rather to become even closer. One thing I knew was preventing us from becoming closer was the fact that we never talked about sex or relationships. I thought that by coming out we could start talking about anything. However, not only do we not talk about those extra things, but also I haven't even mentioned at all anything about me being gay. So far I'm basically pretending nothing happened....

* I am pretending nothing happened because he is a VERY undramatic chill and uncomplicated person and so am I. Maybe that's why I hate this situation and these feelings so much and why he's the first non-gay person I ever tell :(

Throwaway account here, because my BF knows my original Reddit account..

So I need some help with this relationship.. We have been together for almost 5 months now. We live roughly 10 km apart, and neither of us owns a car, so we rely on public transport so we can't just see each other like that. He is a student, and I work. Due to his studies we are never together on weekdays because he have to do homework. Sometimes there can go weeks between we are together, because sometimes one of us need to do something else. However when we finally are together everything is perfect. Nothing to say there.

However when we are apart I feel like I don't have a BF at all. We rarely write to each other. When we do it, it is I that initiate the chat 80% of the time. He often don't answer at all. And we can't chat about ""nothing"". We can't just chat out of boredom. There need to be something, like what we are going to do the following weekend etc.

I know that he loves me, because he have told me multiple times. I love him as well, but I get really confused about the mixed signals I'm getting.

The thing about his homework.. He sleeps at his friends sometimes in the weekdays, so I have begun to question that as well.. I don't know how to handle this :(. I don't know how to tackle that ""I-don't-have-a-bf"" feeling I get between the visits :(.

I'm sort of very confused right now, and would like some advice as to whether what I'm feeling has been experienced before.

By now, I've come out to around half a dozen people. I know it's sort of early, but I'm pretty damn sure I'm gay.

My situation: this year I became really tight friends with a senior girl who I share a class with. In a matter of week, she became my best friend, but she didn't know I was gay until she confessed feelings to me. I came out to her, we had a laugh, and became closer than ever. However, over the past few months that we've spent time with each other, I think I fell in love with her. I know being gay isn't exactly black and white (is it?), but I've pretty much confirmed my homosexuality after realizing that no amount of straight/lesbian sex thoughts turned me on. But is it possible to be only sexually attracted to guys while being emotionally attracted to a girl? Does this mean that I'm bisexual?

I don't go out very much. Until recently, it had been a few years since I went out to a gay bar. Couple weeks ago, myself and a couple friends went out. Last night, for the first time in a long time, I went out by myself. I had a good time and decided I would go out tonight. 

I live a little over an hour from Ft Wayne, Indiana. My area is rural, so no gay bars. Hell, hardly any gays. I made the drive and arrived at After Dark around 11. As I approached the bar, I could see the place was busy. Cars all over the place and hardly any parking. 

My heart started racing at the prospect of walking into the club with so many people there. I drove around for a bit, and then decided to head to Babylon. Logic told me if AD was busy, Babylon likely would not be yet. I was wrong, though.

I parked my car and fucked around with my phone for a few minutes. Logged into Grindr and checked out the faces that were nearby. I started getting messages from people and quickly logged out. Mustered up the courage and made the trek towards the door. It's raining slightly at this point.

I approach the door and there is a guy standing outside, listening to music and dancing beneath the awning. The door is right there, and I can hear the music bumping inside, but I walk right past. Right past the dancing guy and right past the front door. I stop at the corner of the building and realize the smoking patio is just twenty yards away. I hear chatter and some girl laughing. I imagine she is laughing at me.

I turn around and walk back towards the door. And I walk right past it. The dancing guy is ignoring me.

I stop at the other corner of the building and pull out my phone, pretend to be using it. After a minute, I head back towards my car. There is a smoking patio in the back of the building, and despite the fact that there is a tall fence shielding the parking lot from view, I feel dozens of eyes watching me walk.

I got in my car and made the hour drive back home. Came in the house, put on my sweats and a hoodie, and now I am going to watch and episode of Battlestar Galactica. After that, I'll watch some porn and jerk off in bed, just like I do every night of my pitiful life.

I said already that I went out last night and had a good time, and I did. I was getting looks, and I realized they weren't looks of derision. But last night I had a crutch. I arrived at the bar a tad early in the evening, and right when I walked in I saw an old acquaintance, a drag queen that performs there regularly. He wasn't performing last night, but he would be tonight. I would not be able to shadow him like I did last night.

On the way home, I was listening to Fox Sports radio as they talked about the Denver/Baltimore game. The host was talking about some hockey team that had the slogan ""safe equals death"" hanging in their locker room. And I realized that what I was doing was ""safe"". In fact, pretty much everything I had done in my 37 years of life was ""safe"". Don't take risks, don't take chances, don't put yourself out there.

Eventually I jokingly ask him out and he says ""sure this weekend."" Well that doesn't happen so I ask him to come study with me at the library since he expressed interest in doing that at some point. Again he can't. 

So I don't get it. He responds to my texts, jokes around with me, but it looks like he doesn't want to see me ever again? Who does that? I don't even want a relationship--I just think he's a cool guy. And I've never put so much effort into seeing someone before and quite frankly I really don't like it. It makes me feel desperate or something. 

That being said, I haven't texted him in over a month because I don't play these games. He hasn't talked to me either so I assumed he wasn't into it at all. But honestly I've never had a gay friend like that before and now I want to try again. We got along so well and after college who knows if I'll make friends like that again. So I want to text him again. Is that a bad idea? Is he clearly uninterested? If so why would he keep joking around with me? Ughhhh fucking douchebag. Please help.

I have some questions of etiquette and I was wondering if some of my more season gaybros could help a new guy out?  

1. If someone messages you and, based off their message and profile, have no interest in dating them, do you usually respond or just ignore?

2. It seems most people who message me say very little - usually something along the lines of ""Hey man"" or ""You seem fun"".  Is this pretty common?  It makes it harder to get the conversation rolling because they basically just left it in your court.

3. If you find someone who seems fun to hang out with, but you don't have any interest in  dating them (you may not find them attractive, or maybe it's something else), and they say they are looking for new friends, is there a good way to go about establishing that?  I guess, meeting up with them but making sure they know it's on the friend level?

4. I'm a jolly fellow and so the humorous profiles really catch my eye.  However, as I'm browsing others profiles I rarely ever find them.  Is it common that funny/humorous people are really bad at translating that onto print? Everyone seems so...serious! Is it just where I am? I tried to make my profile somewhat funny (but not all of it - some is serious too), should I avoid this?

Anyway, if you have thoughts about one or any of these I'd love to hear them!

I know the guy he was with and he is HIV+, but I don't know a lot else about him or how safe he is.  Later, the party was over and we all left (no hookups for once).  We got in the car I asked him if he had fun, and we laughed.  Then I asked what he knew about that guy.  He knew his name and that he was a student.

Thought I'd share my story with you guys, and see what advice is in store for me here. [Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/10qvvf/how_to_deal_with_a_crush/), [Update #1](http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/11pvjp/update_how_to_deal_with_a_crush/), [Update #2](http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/12atg0/update_2/), [Update #3, kinda.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/12cw3b/what_a_complete_turn_around/)

**Background:** I pretty much figured out recently that I'm bisexual. I am so into this *one* guy. We just met this year, and we've become pretty close pretty quick. Thing is, I just completely fell for him. At first, I thought I was crazy and hated myself for having such feelings. I learned to accept it, and it has made me 100% happier. Now, my feelings for him blocks our friendship from time to time. He doesn't know, and there's a good chance he'll never. 

**Update:** So, I guess I'd go ahead and update while I was in the mood. Things have been going good I guess. I quit being the first to initiate conversation all the time, and he started. So, now the ball is not always in his court. Good.

He confuses me so much though. He touches me, a lot. He doesn't do it to any other guy. He'll poke me randomly, or ask me to pull his shirt down so he can pull his hoodie off. Thing is, there is other guys and *girls* around. He's also been joking about me and him, together. In a way. One time, we squeezed between two desks and he looked and me and said, ""Nut to nut."" So many butterflies.  He looks at me and smiles at me a lot too. Ugh.. I have no idea what he's meaning by it either, if there even is a meaning. He doesn't understand how attracted I am to him, and that pretty much everything he's got is a turnon. -_- 

Even with all the confusion, I am so happy with the rate our friendship is growing. We talk on FaceBook everyday, grab seats by each other when possible, and we honestly can't even look into each others eyes without cracking up. Such an improvement from my first post when we were pretty much strangers.  He makes me so happy, and I hope I do the same for him. I see a good friendship in the future with him, and maybe -hopefully- something more. 

Still the other problem persists though, he never wants to hangout. I don't know why, but I'm patient and don't want to rush things. Maybe one day it will happen. Our class dance is tomorrow, and we had plans of hanging together with our dates (I know, ironic.) and his birthday party is Sunday and he invited me himself. So this weekend is going to be fun! :)

Fast forward a year and I realize i'm gay and start coming out. My brothers were pretty much accepting but you can tell that being a gay brother wasn't something that was ever intended.

I'm scared to really even discuss gay things around them or it's just extremely awkward. It's at the point where it's like I never even came out and never mentioned. Is that bad? I seriously was considering just quitting the fraternity but when you come to a school with no friends the ones you have from your life as a Greek ends up permeating your entire life. If I left the fraternity literally every single aspect of my social life is affected and the university is SO small that I'd never get away from the brothers. 

I'm back in forth in my head because not all the brothers are like this. Some are very supportive and I can't help feeling like me quitting would be like a slap in the face for those that were actually there for me. Fast-forward two years and here I am today still going back in forth in my head. It's really gotten to the point where my college experience has become defined by this state of existence. 

I can't talk to my brothers about this obviously and I can't talk to my family because i'm not out to them. I'm 21 and terrified of coming out to them. Everyone is saying that i've changed and I feel like i'm starting to resent my brothers and my relationship with my family has deterioriated so much that doing anything with them just feels like a chore.

I know this is pretty long but I really just wish I wasn't gay or hadn't come out because it's just been 3 years of regrets, anger and sadness. I KNOW things get better but nowadays i'm just counting the days until graduation which makes me feel even worse, ya know? I should be enjoying my undergrad years but i'm not really. I do have other friends that I can be open with but its hard getting close to them because like I said, the University is ridiculously small and I don't want to vent my frustrations if others will find out because everyone knows everyone. 

I don't really know what i'm asking here but what's the solution? Am I stuck in this rut until I graduate?

So basically, I top my bf, and whenever I try to loosen him up I eat him out, but whenever I try to finger him, he says my nails are too sharp.  I have cut them back to where it hurts me to cut them any further.

A few things:

* I do not have any toys, he doesn't either.
* I have tried letting my nails grow slightly and doing it
* I know fingering isn't for everyone, but I have no problem fingering myself with my nails.
* I want to loosen him up more so that he can have an easier time taking me (even though I am not that big)
* I have never bottomed (and my bf hasn't wanted to top me) so I dont know that much about bottoming at all.

And second thing, I have a slight curve on my dick that goes downward (kinda looks like gravity is taking over).  We are able to do missionary, but whenever I try to move away from this, it seems he just cant work with it at all.  I have tried him on top (cowboy and reverse cowboy) but it doesn't work at all.

What's wrong?",Khaki_Shorts,11,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1izt47/topped_for_the_first_time_it_wasnt_that_great_i/,"My bf and I are both 19, he's my first bf and he has had one ex and a fling before. We've been together since April.

Well, my bf and I just started sex about a month and a half ago. Long story short, after fooling around and jacking off a couple times he wanted to go further and he admitted he wasn't a virgin and that he did go all the way with his ex. This unsettled me and made me very anxious for a couple weeks. I had high expectations for myself and was kind of jealous he started his sex life sooner than I did. I tried to to top the next day, but was too nervous to keep a boner. My bf and seemed to bottom easily (fingering) and keep a boner when he tried to top. It pretty much screwed my mind up for a while. Eh. I'm pretty much over it now.

After I got some advice here and there, I figure I should try to bottom first. I got it after a couple times and actually really enjoyed it. I've done it twice recently. The first was some slow thrusting and me getting used to it. The second time was pretty much full on sex. It was great :)  I was finally able to do it! We were both proud. That was a couple days ago, actually.

I wanted to try more and actually top him today. I had tried to top him a couple times before, but I failed. I actually stayed hard enough and managed to go in all the way today. I also thrusted for a while, however I felt myself getting kind of soft. I pulled out and noticed I was only just semi-hard, that happened a couple times. Also, it didn't feel that amazing; I didn't get much pleasure from it to be honest other than getting it in. That felt good though. 

Maybe it was because I was getting soft? I'm not sure. Maybe it was because it was my first time actually topping? I really don't want to think I'm some kind of exclusive bottom, that doesn't seem right. My boyfriend says he lasts a long time; we went for about 30 minutes and he wasn't that close to cumming. He does enjoy it, though. I asked him about his past experiences and he said he has never came from topping. He just finishes by jacking off.` Maybe, I'm similar to him?

Any advice on this?

It's also bothers me we didn't get much done today. He couldn't top me today, he was getting soft too soon for once. Part of me kind of wants to prove I can take a dick, and he wasn't able to give it. He was able to take like four fingers of mine without pain and I couldn't prove I was able to. Topping wasn't that great either today. I'll stay patient, I guess.

Edit: I also don't think I was doing a very good job topping. I m cut and 6.5 inches so I think I probably should have pulled out more when thrusting to stimulate my penis penis head more. Eh.
