Who wants free software?",thestamp,105,9,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/comments/o7by1/i_am_about_to_publicly_release_a_lan_party/,"If you're in the southern Manitoba region, you may have already heard about it!  


LanHUB is a software suite I developed to make the hoster's life easier, whille engaging the players.  


Tournaments, chat, radio,  achievements, tallies and filesharing tools are just some of the features that help events of any size.  Text messaging, barcode, and paypal account support help larger events save time. I'm always open for more feedback, the point of LanHUB is to make YOUR life easier and have a fun-filled event!


So, to the goods.  Because home lan parties are so essential, LanHUB will be free for all home lan parties when it is released! 


LanHUB and tournamentHUB is already in use in 6 recurring events annually as a private testground, and i feel that its time to release it to the masses!


I'm already in talks with LanPartyEh, and am looking for more partners to spread the word on this! I'll gladly demonstrate it for you for your event, and i will be hosting 2 webinars in a couple of weeks.  http://www.facebook.com/pages/lanHUB/184330371033?sk=events

If you're planning to or have run an event, how can your event run smoother and be more enjoyable for your attendees?

This may be downvoted to oblivion for advertising. Hefully not though, im looking to have a good discussion about what makes a lan party great!

TLDR; Free Lan Party software to download when its released, wants feedback!

**For more information**
Check out the [facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/pages/lanHUB/184330371033), my [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/lanhubcanada), and [the website](http://lanhub.ca) for complete details when its released!

**Edit:** As requested, here is the tentative feature list. [PDF Link](http://lanhub.ca/files/lanhubfeatures.pdf) [PNG Link](http://lanhub.ca/files/lanhubfeatures.png) Note that the Advertising support (not my ads, YOUR ads!) will not make release, neither will ladder support or free for all matches. Those will be added after release. At this point I want to make the code as stable as possible. If time allows, i'll add them back on the checklist.

**Edit 2:** Here is a post outlining the new features as of May 2011. This might give you an idea of the UI until the webinar hits! [Baselan 21 LanHUB changes overview](http://allyourbaseonline.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=23720)

1356175354.0,30,self.lanparty,159zgg,I made an intranet for our lanparty and I published the code on GitHub. Feedback would be awesome!,Risse,35,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/comments/159zgg/i_made_an_intranet_for_our_lanparty_and_i/,"&lt;https://github.com/Krisseck/Lanparty-Portal&gt;

So, I [talked here earlier](http://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/comments/zhjug/what_website_software_do_you_guys_use/c64qv02) about building an intranet system for our lanparty. Well, our lanparty is coming up on the 28th of December and I have (hopefully) released a working version of it! The code is up there on GitHub.

Warning though, it is NOT ready yet! Not even close. Especially the installation procedure is bit... finicky. If you are not familiar with LAMP/WAMP do NOT try and install this. Also you need to use a lot of MySQL, since the admin-panel is almost nonexistant.

Much more documentation can be found at the GitHub-page, like features, installation manual etc.

Demo site: &lt;http://demointra.urbanlan.fi&gt; username: admin, password: demo.

Why I built this in the first place? That is a great question. There is a couple of reasons.

I feel the current lanparty intranets are bit lacking. ALP-website doesn't seem to work at all. LanHUB looks alright, but it needs a downloadable client? Pass. The old systems also don't really take advance of the tournament websites, like BinaryBeast and Challonge.

The main reason though why I built this though is tracking users at the lanparty. So, our Net Crew had the problem: ""we know this one IP address is downloading a shit-ton of torrents, but we have no clue where in the sea of 300 computers he is!"". That's why this was built. Every user registers their seat on the system and it saves the user's IP to the database. In the Admin Seat tool (login as admin, click ""Admin""-picture, click Seatmap) you can see everyone on the party. The search is also awesome. Just type the torrent-asshole's IP address there and it pulls up where he is sitting. Works other way too, if you need to find some guy on the party, type his username there and his seat lights up.

I am planning to have much more functionality on the website, like pizza ordering system, tournament participation &amp; bracketing etc.

Phew, that's a lot of text. Anyways, send some feedback / fork the repo / report bugs, anything, I would really appreciate it! We are having our own lanparty in one week, so I am expecting to find a TON of bugs then.

We're doubling our record capacity to 500 seats!,musical_hog,34,7,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/comments/z2wqv/event_lan_war_xxiii_indiana_university_were/,"Friends, the [Gaming Club at IU](http://www.iugaming.com), here in beautiful Bloomington, Indiana, has just locked down some *major* local sponsorship from our amazing friends at [Smithville Communications](http://smithville.net), allowing us to go off-campus for the first time in our illustrious 12-year history. This means we will be able to host **500** gamers for LAN War 23!

Our last several LAN War events have been tremendous successes -- we literally sold out of 225 seats in 3 days flat -- and we hope to take that interest and push it toward filling all 500 seats for this momentous and monstrously awesome LAN.

**Some highlights of our event:**

* Held at the Monroe County fairgrounds

* 24 hours long, 12pm Saturday, October 13 to 12pm Sunday

* $20 entry fee

* Dinner and energy drinks provided for free

* Free-to-enter tournaments in the hottest games (keep an eye on our site for more information about which games will be chosen)

* Thousands of dollars in generously donated sponsored prizes

*****

Registration is now OPEN for this awesome event. I highly suggest you guys come check us out if you're in the region. We have devoted fans in Illinois, Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and even beyond that. It's well worth the drive!

Part of the fun is screaming across the room to the other team, instead of just typing cursewords. Or if you're on the same team, being able to lean over and plot, or scream wildly.
So, what gives, /r/Lanparty?
Are these photos just being taken at bad times? Are you aware that you can already play WoW with strangers?

we played age of mythology, UT2K4, and ended the night with tribes ascend.

It took us about an hour to get the internet to work for my router so that we could all get internet, but after a pizza run we were off to the races.  Also we all played skyrim for a little while.

Help?,personalmgt,25,5,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/comments/oudui/lan_party_crowd_getting_harder_and_harder_to/,"I organize a regular LAN Party in our province and it is the only LAN Party scene in our place. We usually hit 25-30 attendees and usually starts at 12PM-2AM on Saturday. This happens every month but I fear I do not have the interest anymore to organize another one for 2012.

I have been organizing this for the last 5 years. At that span of time, I would rather categorize the people that join the LAN Party as Generation A and Generation B. Of course, generation A came first.

Now Generation A was my ideal crowd. Everybody always had fun, they were real gamers that didn't care about hardware and played along when I tell everybody to play any game that I shout. The only problem was that we usually hit 11-15 people.

Generation B was a mix of both. Some people go to brag hardware, some people look to play games, some people look to just socialize and we hit a usual 25-30 heads. I gotta say Generation B came in about 2 years ago. The first year with Generation B was fine, when I say we play a bootlegged MW2, we do; when I say we play a bootlegged TF2, everybody does.

The previous 5 LAN Parties have been very hard for me - I swear. I keep a stiff upper lip whenever somebody says ""Good job organizing that LP, it was fun!"", the truth was that I was actually disappointed. It isn't that the same anymore that when I shout a game to play and I start up a server, only 20 percent of the crowd joins and the game is short lived due to the small amount of players. Sometimes, nobody even joins!

When I look around and observe what people are doing, they're just playing on their own, some are playing single player bootlegged MW3/BF3, some are crazily leeching files, some are just talking and shit. This only infuriates me but I restrain my self from any sudden reactions.

The previous LP was the worst, as described above, we also had like 10 newbies and I wanted them to have fun but the veterans are too busy doing their stuff. I don't want those newbies to leave with a bad impression.

To be honest, I do not have a problem if people just want to do their own thing. I know this is what a usual LP should be, only much much different and bigger than generation A. But when you know that whatever they're doing is now hurting a good impression of what an LP is, then it's time to do something.

I don't think I have the motivation to organize the next one.

PS: Now before you call us dirty pirate scums, I'd like to inform you that I live in the Philippines and piracy is a very big issue here that nobody really gives a shit. I have original games, some of the attendees do have, but most people here are just cheap fucks that wants to have fun. We can file share as much as we want, only a few here has a moral compass when it comes to pirating.",,False,self,t5_2rggr,False,,,True,t3_oudui,http://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/comments/oudui/lan_party_crowd_getting_harder_and_harder_to/,

* Have you ever experienced something at a LAN that other LANs should pick up on.
* What is one thing organizers definitely should not do.

* What would your ideal lanparty look like? (features, location, seating, competitions, sales, prizes, sleeping accomodations, etc. anything provided by the organisation) (please try and stay a bit realistic, giving every participant a new gaming PC is not.)

I work for a gaming news/review site, and we've started bringing a few of the products that we've reviewed with us to the LANs we attend. We should have roughly 40 different products to check out from various companies (NZXT, Razer, Corsair, SteelSeries, etc). We'll have a demo PC where people can test out things like keyboards, mice, and headsets. We'll also have things that people can check out, but can't really test for obvious reasons, such as cases.  

So my question to you is how interested you'd be in checking out these sorts of things while you're at a LAN. Not all of these products can be found at local stores, and even if you could, you can't exactly sit down and play a game of BF3 before you buy it. Since we already have these products on-hand, we want to give fellow gamers a chance to sit down and test them out.

If you saw a demo area like this setup at a LAN, what would you think? What would you like to see? How could we make it more interesting for you?

As far as editing policy goes, try to maintain a consistent voice, use correct grammar, etc. In addition, we're not trying to replace our friends at Wikipedia or the PC Gaming Wiki, but to add supplementary information. Try to focus your editing content to LAN party related material, at least until we have enough active volunteers and content.

**Community Subreddits**

Some of you may have noticed these already. We're beginning to promote individual LAN party discussion areas, not the least of whom includes Intel LANFest, who [have put us in a category among the likes of Penny Arcade and ESEA](http://lanfest.intel.com/?page=community).

**Organizer Flairs**

If you organize a large (open to the public) LAN party in your area, and would like recognition for your actions, or a way to distinguish yourself from normal posters, message us, and we'll add a special color coded flair next to your username indicating the size of the LAN event you organize.

I just moved to Royal Oak, MI this last Saturday for a new job (yay!).  However, I don't know ANYONE around here, and while my last experience where I went to a bar alone to meet people went alright (that story can wait for another time), it obviously didn't make me any lasting friendships.

So here's what up:

I'm 23 years old, and pretty chill.  I've got a two-bedroom apartment that I rent alone.  I've got a completely open spare bedroom that could easily seat 5-7 people (probably more, I'm being conservative) with additional room in the main room (don't have much furniture yet).

I've also got a decent internet connection http://www.speedtest.net/result/2003713231.png

I'm a PC gamer, but I'm completely down with whatever people want to play.  My game of choice is SC2, but I'm also a big fan of LoL, HoN, Dota 2, etc.

Anyone interested?  

EDIT #1:  Seems like there actually is a bit of interest, which is great.  A couple of points:

* To people that have to work - I feel ya.  I work 40hours a week so I understand that.  It would definitely be on a Saturday/Sunday.
* Parking around me is free, provided you can find a spot.
* Royal Oak is awesome, so there would be amble activities if people got burned out playing or needed a break.
* Additionally, great food around here, as I'm sure many people already know.

If you REALLY think you could make it in the next week or two (next weekend, or the weekend after) send me a PM and we'll make this happen!


Edit #2 : Looks like I've got the interest I was hoping for, now for logistics!

As I said, I live in the Royal Oak area.  

I'm thinking that this weekend (6/12/12) would be the best for the most people here.

So far I've seen a lot of interest for LoL and for some FPS.  Not much for D3 or SC2, which is fine.

You FPS'ers, what kind of FPS do you play?  PC or console?  This event could hinge upon your answer!  Let me know, make new posts, whatever.  

Also, remember, PM ME IF INTERESTED!  Thanks.

**Edit Thrice**

Dreamhack this weekend.  I'm not sure if that would make it the perfect weekend or the worst weekend for a lan.  On one hand, we've got plenty of gameplay to watch.  On the other, we've got to watch the games.  Thoughts?

**FINAL EDIT, I THINK**

Ok everyone.  Here is what I think is going to happen:

A lot of people want to do this immediately, so...

**Any last minute developments aside, the LAN will be THIS weekend.  That's right, 6/13/12!**

If you can make it, and you want to come, **PLEASE PM** me so I can give you additional information.  
 
You will want to bring your console/PC/whatever and maybe some deodorant.  People start to smell after a 12 hour+ lanathon.  Snacks would also be good.  I'm going to buy a bunch, but I doubt I can feed a horde by myself (nor do I really want to).

If you plan on staying longer than a day (i.e., you want to crash at my place) **that is ABSOLUTELY FINE** so long as you're ok with sleeping on a hardwood floor.  Your choice.

I thought I would pick this subreddit's brains on their solutions to this annoying problem.

When you have a small LAN of friends (10-14 people) it's relatively easy to get people games and get them all playing the same game.  Once you cross the ""16 person"" line, it seems like it's impossible to get a game going with more than 8 people.  There are always people  playing some single player or MMO game by themselves.

In my mind this is caused by 2 factors, 
1) They don't want to play the game... but why are you even at a LAN party if you're not going to play the multiplayer games that everybody else is?
2) They don't have the game... I tend to stick to easy-to-install free multiplayer games in this case (Savage 2, TF2, etc.)
3) They're shy and don't want to ask for help... and they don't know how to find the game on their own.

How do you other LAN organizers deal with this problem?  How do you all get people into the same game, so you can have an awesomely sized server?  How do you educate people so they know where they can find game installs and patches, and how do you SELF motivate them so that you yourself aren't spending 75% or more of your time babysitting people who are installing the game?

I have done a couple before with some friends (The total at this one will be 10 including me) which ran rather well apart from a unfortunate period of downtime due to connection issues. So, I am wondering if it will be worth investing in a LAN switch to allow for direct connect, and if this will near-enough ensure little to no down time.

Furthermore, I am also wondering if there is anything I have overlooked in the planning section of the LAN, so far we have TF2 and LFD2 to play, we have also invested in Age of Mythology. I have also prepared an external hard drive with the Sauerbraten and Track Mania Forever installers. Are there any other game suggestions you have? Preferably for 10 players, as we have had issues in the past with people playing purely single player games...

I am from Gator Gaming, we video game club at the University of Florida. Twice a semester we host a LAN party for the entire university and by extension all of Gainesville, Florida. Our very next LAN is November 19 2012 in the University of Florida: Reitz Union. This LAN party is quite large actually, we have an average of 700 people attend each one. I hear that there are sponsors that roam these boards so I thought I would ask here as well as through email and applications. If you aren't a sponsor then you can always attend for fun.

GatorLAN is huge LAN tournament event at the University of Florida. We at Gator Gaming are extremely passionate about eSports and host 2 GatorLAN's per semester with a minimum attendance of 700 per LAN. Our LAN in April 2012 had the biggest turnout ever with over 1000 people attending.  There will be tournaments in Starcraft 2, League of Legends, Halo 4, Call of Duty: Black Ops,  Super Street Fighter 4, Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, Super Smash Brothers Brawl &amp; Melee, NFL Madden, FIFA, Persona 4 Arena, Tekken Tag Tournament 2, DOTA 2, and Counter Strike:GO. All tournaments are free to enter and top finishers will receive prizes &amp; trophies. The tournaments will follow the most recent competitive rule sets from MLG and EVO tournaments. The event runs from 3PM to 1AM and all tournaments are ran on the day of the event. PC and FPS tournaments are bring your own equipment. We provide the equipment for fighter games.

All tournaments are free to enter and prizes are given to top competitors. The tournaments will follow the most recent competitive rule sets from MLG and EVO tournaments. The event runs from 4PM to 12PM and all tournaments are ran on the day of the event. PC and FPS tournaments are bring your own equipment. We provide the equipment for fighter games.

We promote these events throughout the year in various ways. Our GatorGaming email list serve has over 1100 emails. We do tabling through the year, especially before the events to help promote it.  The University of Florida has over 50,000 students and we post flyers throughout the campus classrooms and dorms.  We also send out emails through the UF dorm system which has thousands of people on their list serve. We have an extremely passionate eSports community and on average we have 700+ people attending our LANs. Our most recent LAN in April 2012 had over 1000 people in attendance. We even attract members of the Gainesville community that do not attend the University and we also draw players from all over Florida as well.

Sponsorship opportunities include but not limited to: Web banners, advertising on our website, flyers, booth space and banners at event (banners are extremely helpful and effective as we put it at our registration desk so every person entering the LAN will see it), mailing list announcement (over 1100 people on mailing list), posters/signs throughout campus (over 50,000 students at University of Florida), and local newspaper coverage. We can also name our events the ""XXXXXXX Starcraft 2 tournament"" or ""Starcraft 2 by XXXXXXXXX"" if XXXXXXXX wishes to sponsor a particular tournament. We will be giving shoutouts to all of our sponsors throughout the LAN via loudspeaker, and during the award ceremonies we will announce prizes donated by sponsors and tell the attendees to check out the sponsors. There will be streaming for many of our tournaments and in the streams, there will be overlays with the sponsors’ logo on a large projector.

The types of prizes we usually get from sponsors that we distribute to winners include: PC hardware, gaming peripherals, cash prizes, promotional items such as t-shirts, posters, and pens. 

I won't leave my name here but if you want to contact Gator Gaming for more information about the LAN check out our facebook page. And if you are a sponsor PM me on reddit and I will PM you back with the proper email.

I've hosted a bunch (5) of smaller LANs in my house, each with 20-30 people. I am now well aware of some of the problems you can run into with a LAN that size especially inside my house with power. 

I'm now looking to expand my LANs to be more full-featured - This next one I plan to host will have about 100 people, for charity. I was wondering if there are any pitfalls when going larger that I wouldn't have encountered in my smaller LANs? These can be anything, ranging from sponsors, to electricity, to networking, to anything.

My equipment:

1. A Dell PowerConnect 2816 as the backbone. (16 gigabit ports, managed, also does DHCP)
1. 5 Linksys srw224 (24 10/100, 2 gigabit uplinks to backbone, table switches)
1. An internal webserver, ftp server, and game server, very powerful (2 ethernet ports).
1. A shitty pfSense server (only 1 ethernet port)

I have no experience running pfSense, so I'm not sure if pfSense NEEDS 2 ethernet interfaces to work. I could switch the two servers, but I don't want my most powerful computer to be dedicated pfSense, since I need a computer to host some game server.

I do have a sort of team, but I can tell I will be doing most of the work.

**TL;DR I'm hosting a 100 person LAN, what are some pitfalls that I don't know about?**

 * Sharing. A more distributed way to share files would be great. Does anyone have experience with D-Lan?
 * A way to broadcast messages, for general announcements and to tell people that they have a game they need to join.

The brackets are really the main thing I want to see. I looked at lanhub, but I can only find a limited beta right now. Is there any other software yout there right now?

First - Thank you for reading.

I figured this was the best sub to ask, I just discovered it by searching through reddit. I've run into the couple of threads that discuss LAN sharing, but I'm so noob I have no idea which program to use. It's not my first LAN, but we've previously failed to deliver file sharing (and I really want to!). I will most likely be hosting more events in the near future, so I don't mind putting in some time to learn (except full time EE student). I have extra computers for testing/server, managed switches, ect. I don't mind testing a couple programs before the LAN, but I would really like some suggestions to go off. 

**TL:DR** **Need appropriate file sharing solutions**

~30 person LAN this weekend

-managed switches, 100Mbs

-I can make them load software

-tournament features not necessary

-preferably free

-DHCP preferred, if that's an issues or worth noting

**EDIT**: I **really** appreciate the feedback from this everyone! The switches [cisco 3500/2900 bought used] are rather smart, but I'm not and that's another story. I recently acquired a cisco console cable, and will be attempting to resolve some separate issues with the switch IPs through CLI.

For starters, I've gone direct connect. Started researching/downloading/installing various hubs/client softs, but I'm finding the gap between my better-than-average-knowledge and most of the existing guides and documentation quite large - an issue exasperated by the lack of layman's support/intimidating CLIs/lack of existing tutorials/forums full of unresolved connectivity issues/ect. I believe my current issue involves a lack of forwarded ports, still learning as I go. When I'm done with all of this, I promise I'll do my own tutorial for future people like me!

Since [I guess] I want ADC, I've narrowed my options to those hub/client softs. Plan on testing ApexDC++, DC++, StrongDC++ for clients and DSHub, ADCH++, ADCH++ GUI for hubs. 

D-Lan, from the feature list, also looks nice. I'm not sure if it requires a hub or if everyone just installs D-Lan. I'm really not sure about anything at all. Thanks again for reading.

FAP - for what it is, seems like it'd be a great solution in another scenario or case I can't get anything else working ;)

**FINAL EDIT** A big thanks to all!! I love the warm welcome and help I've received in the sub, you definitely don't find that everywhere. For the curious, we successfully used **ApexDC++/YnHub** (for the gui mainly, though it's old). We were only getting around 10Mbs though, which isn't bad I just expected a little more (probably my cables :p ). I'll continue to test other solutions such as D-LAN and FAP, while I also got in touch with the LanHUB and look forward to testing that as well.

Typically we play the same games.  UT or CS for FPS, Age of Myth for RTS, Diablo II for action/rpg.  I would like to try something different this year and have some guide-lines.  I would appreciate feed-back within the guide-lines for new and interesting games.

Guide-lines:

1.  Game must support (8) players either co-op or vs (co-op would be nice)
2.  Game can be through steam but can not cost more than $10, can cost more than $10 if a steam 4-pack is offered that results in the individual cost of the game being about $10.
3.  Must hold the interest of 8 players for approx 10 hours.
4.  Must be playable through LAN or Internet with support of all players through just ONE IP!
5.  No turn-based, haha.  I love so many turn-based games but not realistic for 8 players.
6.  Must run on 3 to 4 year old hardware!  Think core2duo ""era"" with probably circa 2008 vid cards that could definitely not run SC2, Diablo 3, etc.

Preferences:

1.  Game that has character advancement/development.  I think this would keep our interest.  A game like Dung Defenders is a perfect concept for us but only 4 players so nixed for 8-player LAN.

2.  No FPS, we are not huge FPS fans unless it's really unique and supports continuous leveling/character building of some sort.

No:

Demigod/LoL - been there, done that

Minecraft - We are not ""creative"" people, open sandbox is cool but we would get bored creatively building and ultimately Minecraft doesn't have much other point.

Considering:

Torchlight II - if only six players show vs eight

Terraria??? - I haven't played this but it looks like it might be great character building, collection, exploration game?  Would need feed-back on this one.

Serious Sam II - but only as a switch later in the night when we are too drunk to focus on an exploration type game, still need primary game recommendation.

I have played some great indie games lately like OMD, FTL, Dung Defenders and I know there is a cool 8-player game out there calling us.  Please help us find it!

First off, congratulations to the community for making a very big stepping stone of reaching 4,242 gamers! Perhaps this will be the answer to the universe, life, and everything? Maybe not.

**The Wiki**

In regards to the wiki being read-only, it really isn't. You are actually required to have gained 100 karma and have an account 100 days old to contribute to the wiki. This steep requirement is to only allow true contributors of the subreddit to further contribute by helping with the wiki.

Yes, I am aware that there are some broken pages in the wiki. I am trying to get that sorted out! Apologies!

**Lan Party Software**

There has been an exciting number of new projects, and it would really benefit the community (and you) if you promote it on our [Useful software wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/wiki/usefulsoftware). There is a minimum contribution to the community before you can edit, so help us out, and we'll help you out!

Also, feel free to message the mods (or myself) so I can give you some flair, so event coordinators are reassured that they are speaking with the official team of that piece of software (just like my flair).

**TLDR**

The future is bright for this subreddit, and for Lan Parties, thanks to the initiative of those who are developing great Lan Party Software!

1358476263.0,12,self.lanparty,16sjem,Has anybody ever tried to host a participation-based LAN tournament that spans the entire event?  ,TheSambassador,12,0,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/comments/16sjem/has_anybody_ever_tried_to_host_a/,"I've hosted/organized LAN parties for years, and every one that goes above 20 people starts to degrade in quality.  It's extremely difficult to get a full game going (unless it's Counter Strike or TF2, since everybody seems to have them).  As LAN organizer, I also end up spending a huge portion of the LAN party walking around and trying to get people to get in the currently hosted ""main"" game.

The LANs that are the most fun, in my opinion, is when everybody is playing together, and it's this giant shared experience.  LANs that I go to which consist of 1 CSS server and 1 TF2 server up, then a bunch of random people playing WoW or LoL, just aren't very FUN, at least for me.

I, personally, also love playing a variety of games, though I understand that some people love just LANing WoW or LoL all night.  Whenever I get those people into a new game though, they almost always enjoy it.  I haven't found anybody who has HATED Pirates, Vikings, and Knights.

I'm curious if other LAN organizers have tried to mitigate this, specifically by hosting a participation-based tournament with great prizes.  Here's what I'm thinking:

* Full game list posted before the event, the actual ""participation tournament"" starts about 2 hours after the event starts (give people plenty of time to get the games installed).
* 1-2 ""official"" games going at once, changing every 1-2 hours or so.
* I keep track of, either manually or through some sort of script, the names of the people connected to the game, and maybe other stats (like overall time connected, their score, etc.)
* We have raffle prizes going that only the people in the current official servers can win.
* At the end, people who participated the most get prizes!

People still don't HAVE to play in the official servers if they hate a game, but this way it's significantly encouraged to have a game installed prior to the event and have people actually JOIN games other than their favorite games.

Starcraft II is taking a prominent role at this LAN party, with an exclusive Starcraft II tournament being the headliner - you won't be able to play in other tournaments until you're knocked out of Starcraft, but we'll be having both double elimination and best out of threes for SC2.

Other tournaments on deck this semester include Team Fortress 2 (6v6), League of Legends (5v5), and Dota 2 (5v5). These tournaments will also be double elimination, so there will be a more competitive atmosphere than at previous BSG LANs. The cost is $20 (pre-pay only), and dinner on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday are both included. We'd love to see you in Mount Pleasant for an awesome weekend of video gaming!

Why I am here and not there is that there was a little electrical fire near (but not in) our event site. This then took down power to our site, the backup generator only had enough power to run the lights, and even that ran out of gas after a short time. We were there sitting in the dark, many residents from a nearby dorm and taken shelter here when the fire alarms in their building went off, and then the madness starts. RA's (student Resident Advisers) started barking orders that made no sens, their bosses and campus security show up to find out what to do. Eventually we are all told to walk across campus in fear of people getting to cold while the heat was off. An hour later power was restored, we get to go back in but have to close up in case there are more power issues. We got everything cleaned up and went home.

Everyone in attendance was very chill and went with the flow. The other people who showed up proved they needed a crash course on crisis management, first in identifying what is and is not a crisis; then in what to do and what not to do. We were escorting people out with flashlights when one of the university employees started to yell at people to leave despite of their boss, and the public safety officers gave clear directions for a calm and ordered clearing of the building.

This is the only time our group has, in its over seven years, had to shut down an event. It is also the first time we didn't cause our power problems, and we didn't even get a chance to turn anything on.

To date I've been running the network off a 100mbit down/5mbit up (half-duplex) cable connection, but at the last event I had to actively monitor upload and null-route connections/transfers to keep latency at a minimum.  Thankfully the cable provider is our sponsor and we're able to get a second circuit, issue being I have very little experience load balancing connections and no high-end gear to do it with.  More so, do you think that's even the right solution?


I've looked into implementing popular torrent/xfer ports in attempts to limit upload use, but have had very little success.  What are other groups doing to try and keep their internet connection running smoothly?

Lately, though, I've been looking to expand. Ideally, I'd like to host somewhere other than my house. I've considered booking private rooms in pizza joints, conference rooms at hotels, and computer labs at my college (which I did once and it was a great turnout but it felt super disorganized and we're lucky that nothing got stolen!). I feel like wherever I think of, there would be complications, such as having to end when the pizza joint closes instead of going all night, needing to hire some sort of security, etc. It's kind of intimidating to plan these out all on my own, so I'm looking for advice.

Where are some good places to host a LAN? What do I need to keep in mind for certain places (security, etc.)? How likely is it that a computer store (or something similar) would offer assistance, sponsor the event, or perhaps even host?

Here is some information of the tools for the LAN party:
    
* Everyone coming will be running Windows so a batch file or .exe file will be fine. 
    
* I am hosting the games on a workstation that has raided hard drives and dual gigabit ethernet so speed won't be a problem when installing over a network. 
    
* Most of the games are backups of CD's so they are in ISO form on my workstation.

Again my general goal is to have an streamlined installer to help my less tech savvy friends with in the install process. Instead of giving them constant instructions it would be very helpful to have a small file that they can click and do most of the work for them.

Currently I'm living at home and have hosted a few with a little over 10 people. But seeing as I'm going to be leaving for college next school year I want to get my own equipment, as I won't be able borrow my Dad's stuff.  

Items of import:

* 10 medium length Ethernet cables
* gigabit switch with at least 10 slots
* power strips(extension cords?)

These items I currently have available through my dad who is a computer contractor that works at home and ran the wiring for our house(i hooked up the outlets among other things). Since I'm doing this for myself the needs are slightly different.  

Is there anywhere to get bulk deals on ethernet cables? I see them decently priced individually on newegg, but it stands to reason that buying a pack of 10 or so would be cheaper. Also I noticed on wikipedia cat*6* cables being mentioned, has this completely superseded cat5 cables then?  

I don't know how differentiate switches besides the gigabit classification and number of slots. Anything else to consider?  


Finally power strips. Is there anything to keep in mind for strips that will have a bunch of power being used up?

This time round we're doing tickets for 25 quid - nice and cheap to get things rolling.  Not looking to make any money this time - if we're lucky enough to have cash left over after paying venue, desks etc. the change is going into a bar tab for everyone.

Game selection is going to be an awesome range of free / super cheap LAN friendly games.  There's gonna be PEWPEWPEW on a projector (which has to be played to be believed), Trackmania, Armagetron, TF2, Soldat, and any other amazing LAN games I've forgotten.  Probably lots.

First off, I have a gigabit switch and everyone has rj45's so we are set with the networking hardware.  Also it is myself and 3 very close friends who Play minecraft on my server all of the time.  So my question is, should I open the world file from the server in single player and then open to LAN? If so, will the player files transfer over? Any thing that could cause issues (like firewalls) that I should keep I mind if I do need to troubleshoot?  
I am hosting and playing on my gaming pc, hosting to a iMac and two laptops.  I'd appreciate any tips or help you can offer.

Oh also, we have are long used SMP map but I feel like that might get boring.  Any ideas for gameplay.  I was thinking spleen or something and an adventure map.

For a lan at home anything will do. But especially above that I'm curious what you picked and why. 

I'm currently planning on a LAN for about 60 people, so I will need at the least two switches. 

My eye is currently on either two Dell powerconnect 2748's 48 port gigabit. But this is a smart switch, so no snmp just web interface. 

On the other hand I have the option of going for three d-link des-3526 and 3326's which are 24port 100mbit with gigabit uplinks. These are fully manageable with snmp. 

Price wise the d-links will be a bit cheaper, but not much difference overall. 24port switches would be easier to divide over tables. But gigabit is tempting on the other side. 

Long story short, which would you go for?

My buddies and I have been having LAN parties for a little over 10 years now. We play, essentially, the exact same line up as we always have. We have a LAN coming up in a couple weeks and I'd love to try and mix things up a bit with some new titles. Suggestions? For reference, we're all playing on PC (no consoles).

**Here's some criteria:**

* Would prefer things that are easy to pick up and start (Magicka, for example).

* In the past we've thrown down mostly team matches/games and not so much free-for-alls.

* Co-op would be nice.

**Here's what we've traditionally played:**

* Counter-Strike

* Team Fortress Classic for VIP mode. Wish CS still had Assassin maps &gt;.&lt;

* TF2

* Worms (World Party, Armageddon)

* HL2:DM

**Occasionally we'll throw down:**

* Rocket Crowbar (mod for HL)

* WC3

* Hunted/Border One (mods for QuakeWorld, old school)

* Unreal Tourney (the original)

* Soldat

The humongous organization [Dramhack](http://www.dreamhack.se/) earlier held a LAN-event in the northern Swedish town of [Skellefteå](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamHack#DreamHack_history).

That's where [Nordsken](https://nordsken.se/infoeng) and my friends at the local campus steps in. To make it simple, we take the earlier humongous BYOC area of 800-1000 attendees to a more mundane ~400 seats. The rest of the area in the convention center will be fitted with boardgames and cardgames. 
 
And my role in this will be power distribution. To say the least, i did not know that computers could suck that much power.

We are Tampa eSports, a grassroots organization whose goal is to grow, promote and showcase the esports scene in and around Tampa Bay.

This July 27th we are having our Summer LAN event, our second LAN event this year (with many more to come hopefully). Our last event drew 100 people with 80+ computers connected at one point. [You can check out our post-event write up with pictures here](http://tampaesports.com/so-we-had-a-lan-this-past-weekend/).

This time a round we're holding a Starcraft II: Heart of the Swarm tournament and a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tournament side-by-side. We are not formally holding a MOBA tournament due to the venue capacity constraints, however we will have organized 5v5 play at our general gaming area. There will also be a coaching corner for Starcraft II, raffles, giveaways, free red bull and possibly free pizza! This is a BYOC event.

I'm hosting a laptop-friendly lan party at my university, UFV, looking for input for all aspects :)

Expected # of players: 10

Games List:

CoD 4;

Halo 1;

AoE 2;

MOHAA + expansions;

Bf 1942;

FEAR Combat;

CS 1.6;

Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter;

Soldat;

Our university has good wifi coverage, haven't checked if it is lan-server friendly.  On the chance that it is not, the plan is to bring my ol Dlink N300 along with a 5 port gigabit switch.  I have had 5 xboxes play with 10 people online before, so I'm hoping that router will hold up (lan only, no internet access with this setup).

For game distribution, I have a USB 3.0 external harddrive...I've noticed while torrenting that at about 3 MB/s I get drive overload, yet when transferring whole completed files from my primary harddrive (SSD) to it I get ridiculously high transfer speeds, so a question would be, would sharing the games folder on the network and letting everyone copy off of it be the fastest method, or just handing it around to people be best?

I'm just going to request people bring 2 litres/chips so we will have some snack food.  

Potentially we will have a laptop available for dedicated server hosting, I know with minecraft it is very beneficial for games to be hosting on ramdisk (if no SSD available), would ramdisk be necessary for the games I've listed?

Any thoughts?

Of special note for the lan was internet being up extra early - the day before the event was a record and a godsend for me as a caster.

The event is part of the Melbourne PC User group, which means that there were a lot of interesting and oddball special interest groups who popped by to see what us lanners actually get up to. Things like microelectronics and video - should be a good future!

Everyone including the event organisers were very friendly and even with the usual lack of sleep handled things fine.

I'd like to invite my local redditors to join.

We have permission to utilize an 300,000 sq/ft closed factory (owned by our friends' family) [Seen here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZyKhNvjUYA).  We do have running water, male/female bathrooms, a refrigerator, as well as AIR conditioning. A 50 MB/sec business class router will supply our internet juice.

This summer, we moved into a bigger area of the 'office', and are looking for a few more gamers.    We mostly play steam games: CS 1.6, CSS, TFC, TF2, HL mods, LoL, and most frequently, DotA2.  

During the last 5 AthensLANs, we've consistently had around 20 gamers. This year we have room for 50+ PC gamers, as well as 20+ console gamers.

It's an informal setting. No scheduled tourneys or prizes, just whatever we come up with on site.

* BYO Computer, xbox, atari, gameboy, etc. Extras may be available.
* BYO food/drink/etc.
* Must be open to 21+ y/o culture. 
* No children allowed. 
* Drinking/smoking permitted.
* Cost: ~$20 for 3+ days of 24/7 gaming (covers the 50 MB line, electric, water)
* Sleeping onsite **may** be available (on the floor in extra office rooms).

But, we don't really know just how everything works out. We're driving there, bringing our towers/laptops, and we're planning to be there the whole event. So one of our major concerns is money. We're only students, so we don't have unlimited money. How much money would be a good idea to bring along, wanting to buy food 3 times a day, sodas, coffee etc. And how much should we bring in reserve for, say, hardware upgrades, games or new peripherals? 

Next thing is security. We're two people bringing tower and 1 monitor each, and one guy coming with a laptop. I've researched, and it seems that Kensington locks are the best to use. What locking system would you recommend for a setup with 1 monitor with a K-Slot, and a tower without K-Slot, but with holes such as watercooling holes for running the wires through. 

Lastly, sleeping and storage. I know there's sleeping areas there. How are they? And if I want to store some of my stuff somewhere, say the box I'm bringing my tower in, where can I put it? Or will it just have to live under my desk for the duration of the event?

I hope you all can help me out here:)

Currently installed games include CS:S and SoF2:DH, but CS is too slow-paced, and SoF isn't a great game. Since we have no money to actually buy games, they a either have to be free or crack-able.

I had tried to install JK3, but frequent crashing and possible incompatibility rules it out of being played. Someone else claims to be working on cracking SWBF2, but I'm not counting him. I'm currently working on Blazing Angels 2, but the ridiculous Ubisoft DRM concerns me slightly.

One day I'd love to travel to Europe for Dreamhack, but for the moment I am stuck cruising around Australia. The largest LAN I've been to was [Reloaded LAN](http://www.reloadedlan.org/index.php), Adelaide, Australia - I think there was about 450-500 BYOC attendees and a number of consoles. I loved the atmosphere of the event (especially when the power went out at 3AM on a very stormy night).

The [LAN I am involved with](http://www.respawn.com.au) comes a close second. We peaked at 450 BOYC attendees, but decided the squeeze in the hall wasn't worth it, so we dropped a row of tables and went back to ~400.

My question is, what are some good ways to connect with my fellow gamers in town? A Game Stop just opened a few months ago, but other than that, there aren't any other gaming stores in town. I suppose word-of-mouth is the best way with a dose of Facebookery for good measure.

* What are some reoccurring questions you see in the subreddit/misc. forums that you think could be answered by a wiki article better than individual advice?

I am just curious as to whether anyone knows of any fairly popular LAN parties that get set up here in Colorado. I used to own a LAN center with my parents and we would have lan parties frequently. I'd like to work for/with someone who can get a decent sized LAN party started.

I have about 10 years of experience with computer hardware (and to a lesser extent software) and I am currently taking multiple networking classes in order to earn certification (CCNA) in Networking.

I've thrown a few small lans over the years (10-15 people), but kept it mostly to close friends.
These days it's hard to get 10 of my buddies in a room to lan, so it might be time to recruit some new players for our group.

I'm moving at the end of January, and want to have a small lan sometime at the end of February.
Probably around 10 people, but maybe more depending on interest.

My group sticks to a few core games, L4D2, TF2, LoL. But of course you wouldn't be limited to just those.

Let me know if anyone is interested, and we'll make this happen!
I'd love to make this a regular thing, bi-monthly perhaps?

***UPDATE***

Having some power issues at the new place. A few days before I moved in someone broke and and stole as much copper as they could under the house. As a result we didn't have water for a few days, and have some electrical issues they're working on.
The lan will still happen, will just be at a later date.

Good news is, though, there's a 200 man lan in Seattle about the time we were planning on having our lan.
So if anyone is interested hit them up. Maybe all us Redditors can sit near each other.

I'm from RedFlag Lanfest in Perth, Western Australia. We run a LAN party for around 400-450 people over a weekend, 4 or 5 times a year.

RFLAN #37, our biggest LAN in terms of both attendance and floor space yet, will be taking place next weekend (17-18th) and will include the following competitions:

* Starcraft 2
* Counter-Strike: Source
* Heroes of Newerth
* Team Fortress 2
* Dawn of War 2
* Call of Duty 4
* League of Legends
* Minecraft
* Super Smash Brothers
* Trackmania

RFLAN currently takes place at Curtin Stadium (at Curtin University, in Bentley, Perth).

This LAN coincides with the Starcraft 2 Blizzard Cup, hosted by GomTV, and as such the people at Perth Barcraft will be coming along to view the finals at the LAN. Spectators of this will be allowed free entry to the LAN, so even if you haven't got a ticket, you can still come along to view the games.

However, now for the unfortunate news... we are actually **sold out** for this event :(. But that doesn't mean you can't attend another time, so these are our dates for 2012:

* February 25-26
* April 28-29
* July 14-15
* October 13-14
* December 15-16

However, if you already happen to have a ticket, then we hope to see you down there next weekend! Otherwise, hopefully we will see you at one of our events next year.

We would need some game which keeps the motivation up. We are 4 or 5 players. Competitiveness could prove nice to bring in some excitement

games we played already were: Company of Heroes, Call of Duty 4, Quake 3, Age of Empires 3, CoD5 Nazi Zombies, FlatOut 2, Warcraft III and that's basically it

Any ideas? Genre doesn't really matter, I just imagine if we play something like Unreal Tournament, things where you only play stuff like Deathmatch and the better players just win everytime it gets boring too fast.

Next question, If do end up getting this connection running, will we be able to play StarCraft 2 on it? or does starcraft use servers only?

I've been tasked with some of the logistics.

The party itself will be held in a rented cottage 2hrs north of where we live. We are going to this place to Ski, when we're not fragging the heck out of each other. This has introduced some complications, including storage space in the cars on the way up.

There will be 8 people attending, so we are planning to have 4 Xboxes and 4 TV's. Acquiring the Xboxes are not a problem, but the TV's are proving to be problematic.

So I ask of you:

* What can we do in the ways of TV / Monitors? I've looked at renting TV's for this purpose, but the rental companies are asking $100 per set, which is prohibitively expensive. I have a 24"" desktop monitor I can lend, which is definitely usable, but everyone else is a laptop user without such equipment. And as I mentioned, space is at a premium so bringing our own 42"" flat screens and lugging them up is not an attractive option.

* What are some games that we can play 8 player split-screen on a LAN? This group of friends regularly gets together to play 4-player local Halo, so we have that game covered, and I understand that Halo will support 4 xboxes on a local LAN with 2 players per box. However, that's only one game. What about COD or Battlefield? Do any of them support such a set up? And is there ability to include bots in any of those games?

Looking forward to hearing any suggestions you may have.

Thanks

Just wondering what you all use for an intranet at your LANs. At our LAN (LANmineSA), we originally used our website as an intranet (we have internet at LANs). Then used http://challonge.com/ to organise and run our comps. 

We now use Autonomous LAN Party (http://sourceforge.net/projects/alp/), which for the most part works very well. But it is no longer developed, so there is no support/community (that I know of?) and it is starting to age.

Then the other day, I came across this: http://lansuite.orgapage.de

Looks amazingly powerful with some really cool modules, except by default it is in German. Google does an OK job of translating it, but I wouldn't want to trust it in production for a LAN. And the built in translations appear to be lacking.

Has anyone that runs an English speaking LAN's had success using LANsuite? I'm worried about putting in the effort in to get the translations right, and then a new LS version comes along and we either can't upgrade, or have to do all the hard yards again.

Look for to hearing how the pro's do it!

I'm from RedFlag Lanfest in Perth, Western Australia. We run a LAN party for around 400-450 people over a weekend, 4 or 5 times a year.

RFLAN #39 will be taking place on April 28-28th (from 9AM to 12PM) and will include the following competitions:

* Starcraft 2
* Counter-Strike: Source
* Team Fortress 2
* Call of Duty 4
* League of Legends
* Minecraft
* Super Smash Brothers
* Trackmania
* Guitar Hero (Trial Tournament)

Last event we upped the anti, and gave out over $1000 as prizes, on top of all the prizes that we got from our sweet sponsors (at the bottom of our website, check them out!), and we will be continuing this for this event.

RFLAN currently takes place at Curtin Stadium (at Curtin University, in Bentley, Perth).

Below are our dates for the rest of the year as well:

* April 28-29
* July 14-15
* October 13-14
* December 15-16

Hopefully we see you down at the event in a couple of weeks! Otherwise, hopefully we will see you at one of our events later in the year.

Those machines are not the greatest computers and they will be a first come first serve option. You can also rent a computer from Constellation Computers.

We've got varying skill levels are our LAN parties. People like RTSes in general, but with games like Starcraft you've got people who are great, and people who suck, which makes it hard. We're thinking Warcraft 3 might be better since it's less complex (Warcraft 2 is hard to get going on modern machines). Are there any simple RTSes that anyone can pick up?

For FPSes, we're going Serious Sam 3 since that has co-op so skill levels matter less. Shootmania might be something for us to look at. Maybe Killing Floor since it's on sale.

Lastly, besides Torchlight 2, are there any good 6 player dungeon crawlers?

I've recently started a Minecraft club as an activity at the school I work at. I've been using a student's router for the past few weeks but as we've expanded (to around 20 students now) he's worried his router isn't going to cope.

Can anyone advise as to what I should purchase to do the job?

So I'm thinking of doing a LAN Party at my school and need help on figuring out how to set-up the network for it. I've started looking into switches since I would like everything to be hard-wired for one, and for another I doubt a simple wireless router would suffice for the amount of people I'm hoping to have which is about 30ish perhaps a few more. Now the majority of the LAN will be console gaming, with a select few being PC gaming.

I've done a fair amount of research and learned that layer 2 switches are not capable of DHCP, which I would be forced to manually setting the ips? but if I were to connect say my home wireless router to the switch would it be capable of the DHCP? 

So I guess what I'm asking is for the amount of people I'm hoping to have what type of switch would I need? Would a layer 2 switch work just fine? or would I need to connect my wireless router to it? Or would I need a managed switch?

So I'm setting up for a small LAN with my friends (3 people) and I'm using an old spare router to act as the network for all our computers. Now this router isn't connected to the internet (which is what I want), but I am also wirelessly connected to another router which is. However, whenever I turn on the router which isn't connected to the internet (the network one) and I am connected to my proper router which is connected to the internet, I lose connection to the internet completely (still says under Network and Sharing that the proper router has internet access).

so here is my question,

what games do you all actually prefer at a LAN party?
so far the games i've been considering are
TeamFortress 2
Minecraft.
Garry's mod (Build Tournament with judges)
and possibly a game like warcraft 3 or C&amp;C Generals / Zero hour,

Other new things we now have include a flashy new logo, organized home page, and organized categories for each article. (to add an article to a category, simply add [[Category:**Categoryname**]] to the bottom of any article)

In addition, April brings a new week, and as a result, [a new article to write](http://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/comments/rmqtg/writing_the_wiki_one_step_at_a_time_1_networking/)! Feel free to help us out if you know anything about [networking at a LAN event](http://www.lanpartywiki.com/wiki/Networking_at_a_LAN_Event).

**Flair Colors**

People who have PMed us about getting custom flairs to designate events or notable sites they manage now have colored flairs! If you find you still have a boring, plain colored one, modmail us the attendance numbers of your event and we'll update it accordingly.

Original Post:

Hey guys, I've seen many people post their small projects and big ones too. Many people code from the ground up, others have had projects passed along and added onto them.

I like to keep things simple, really, really simple, like wordpress simple.
I've hosted my small (30-40) person LAN intranet that is a work in progress for you all to see, and if anyone is interested I'm happy to throw together a somewhat distributable copy.

The project is named Swanky, mainly for lack of a better name, partly because the end product should be swanky.

I'm reserving rights on the admin area at the moment, I'm open to criticism, both constructive and critical. I want your help to make it bigger, better, faster and stronger.

Images on the slider are irrelevant at the moment, they just fitted the resolution, and the site is currently Chrome/Firefox aimed, as opposed to Internet Explorer, though compatibility will be increased as it progresses.

We're about to run a working bee, where we unpack, sort and inventory all of our power and network cables. While we have the time to do it, I'm considering the possibility of labeling the cables in some manner. 

So I come to you.

A) Do you have any labels of any kind on your cables?  
B) If yes, what labels? (""owned by ... "" tag, length indicator, asset ID, other)  
C) How useful do you find them? Do you *actually* benefit from it, or just talk about hypothetical ways it's cool?  
D) If you had your time again, would you still put labels on your cables?

**When:** Doors open at 5:00 PM on November 2nd, and the event will run all the way through into November 4th.

**Where:** The Amana Colonies RV Park, 3890 C Street Amana, IA 52203. We have rented out a pair of their buildings to host the event.

**What do you need to bring:** A computer with everything needed to actually use it. Aside from that, here are a list of some good ideas-

&gt;Power cable (though power is provided, I try to bring a surge protector just in case)

&gt;Money (for the entry fee, food, spending money at local shops, etc...)

&gt;Games (please have these patched/up-to-date)

&gt;Sleeping bag or Blankets

&gt;Inflatable bed (w/pump), Cot, Camping bed, etc...

&gt;Pillow

&gt;Toothbrush &amp; toothpaste

&gt;Shampoo &amp; Soap

&gt;Towel (yes, the almighty towel)

&gt;Deodorant

&gt;Extra clothing

&gt;Food &amp; Drinks

There are free showers at the event, complete with hot water. The second building we have is for a sleeping area if you don't want to fall asleep in your vehicle.

As for food, you will be mostly on your own. There will be some people at the event selling food at pretty cheap prices, and there are also grills and fire pits if you want to bring and cook your own food. Be warned that if you bring any coolers or anything, they can not be blocking any walk ways. Fire hazards and what not. Also please do not bring your own person mini-fridge or anything of the sort. There are some places to pick up food nearby, if you want to leave the event and come back.

We will be supplying tables, chairs, and cables to hook up to the network/internet. 

**Fee:** There is a link at the bottom of this post where you can preregister for an amount of $30. You can also show up at the door, but the fee will be $40. This money is to cover the cost of renting the space, the equipment, as well as prizes.

**Tournament Games:** While this list isn't 100% complete, there are some games that we know for sure will be involved

&gt;CS:Go

&gt;Battlefield Vietnam

&gt;Halo

&gt;Doom 2

&gt;Perfect Dark

&gt;Quake 3

&gt;League of Legends or Dota2

Now, there will also be a classic fighting game which hasn't been decided on as well as another PC game. It should also be noted that these are only games that will be part of the tournament part of this event. There is still plenty of downtime in which we are free to play whatever with whoever, and enjoy a large LAN party.

**Final Bullet Points:** A few other key things to note about this event. There are teams to this, so bringing a group of friends is always suggested. If you don't have anyone else coming, don't worry! We usually have some pick up teams that we form at the event, or you can easily be added to an existing team.

Each of the game tournaments will award a team points, which will be tracked over the course of the event. At the end of the Event, we will award 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place with trophies to award their skills. There will also be prizes for winning events, and as part of a random give away at the end. 

There will also be a ""Real Life Rogue' event, as well as a Scavanger Hunt and a PC Demo Derby. Don't worry, we won't be hurting your computers.

My questions:

1. Do the event organizers typically coordinate with local power 
companies prior to the event?

2. What kind of hardware do they use to supplement
 such a large load on the grid?

3. Will any venue work, or are there certain facilities that are 
optimized for large draw in a concentrated space? If so, what measures
 are taken to accommodate that much current?

4. What are some good rules to abide by when organizing an event 
that requires several computers in a small space?

5. I am an organizer for a convention that has almost 100 
computers running simultaneously and increases every year. When should
 I start seeing issues with power and what should I do to resolve those issues?",,False,self,t5_2rggr,1342461940.0,,,True,t3_wnkmy,http://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/comments/wnkmy/rlanparty_what_precautions_are_taken_for_power/,

I don't want to link directly to [reddit.com/r/gaymers](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers) as some of the content is NSFW.

At the moment, our target number is 30 people, venue maximum is 50 (there is another room in the bar with a larger capacity, but larger minimum spend), but in the past we've had low numbers show up for the bar crawls, we haven't had more than 15 people show up for a single event, [a board game event I organised in March](http://sydneygaymersmarch.eventbrite.com.au/). At the moment Facebook is our only marketing tool, but I don't want to be at a loss if no-one shows up and I'm left with the catering bill ($15 pp) and hire fee ($150) for 30+ people.

**What**  
  
- It’s that time of the year, we’re hosting another LAN in our closed factory in Athens OH.   
- The space is ours to do with as we please, hence this LAN will be for 18+ year old ADULTS ONLY.   
- The LAN will be running 24hrs/day for the weekend. You may sleep in the side office rooms of the building (if you require sleep).  
- No formal tourneys or prizes.

Typical showing is 25-35 people. This year we’re expecting more than 40 (coming from Scotland, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, Ohio, and New York).  It’s not a public LAN, and is not advertised anywhere.  I figured I’d post up on Reddit again (did this for our summer LAN), and invite a few people. Please PM me if you’re interested.  
- The most popular game in our crowd is DotA2. Counterstrike, LoL, TF2, TFC, HL deathmatch, and other steam games are common.  

**Where**  
  
- Athens, Ohio.

**When**  
  
- Jan 18 – 21st. (21st is MLK holiday in the US)

**Bring**
  
- A computer, power strip, and an Ethernet cable (Cat 5/6)
- Sleeping bag and pillow.

**Provided**
    
- 50 MB unthrottled business class cable internet connection
- Desks, chairs, router, switches, bathrooms, two big screen TVs for consoles, separate rooms for sleeping, refrigerator, parking.

I work for a school within Birmingham as an ICT technician that will be setting up a stall for the forthcoming Christmas Fayre which will take place on the 7th of December 2012. Just as a course of gathering information and some insight I was wondering if anyone within the community has had successful experience in trying to obtain merchandise, promotional material, equipment for stalls, LAN parties for social events.

A year ago when we first started this venture, a colleague and I visited a few Game and Gamestation stores to try and obtain such objects including a full sized statue of Gaz and Mastercheif from the Call of Duty and Halo series. At most of the stores we were promptly turned down. Other than obtaining a few posters out of pity we did not get much for our previous event (2011). As with any sequels we are trying to make this event bigger and better and are hoping to incorporate more posters, visual displays and perhaps even tournament prizes for the students and visitors to our stall.

The school has gone through a tremendous revolution and its setting up events like this that helps to strengthen the bond of student teacher relationships. As well as gathering support from the life blood of gaming industry that we all hold so dear to our heart.


We are using about 60 machines over two class rooms with the partition wall being removed  for a duration of three hours. There will be four projectors used showcasing the games so they can be viewed by visitors. As its a secondary school we cannot play anything above 16 age limit.

We have the following games available: Halo, Team Fortress 2, Street Fighter IV, Need for Speed Most Wanted and Fifa 12. Any help in sponsorship would be much appreciated.

Here is a picture of the smaller event that happened last year.

* [Leach LAN 8](http://www.swlans.co.uk/leachlan-8/)
* [Westwoods Centre in Northleach](http://goo.gl/maps/jI6d)
* 1800 5th July -&gt; 1800 9th July
* £50
* Good facilities
* 30/80 places filled so far
* I will be your bitch all weekend

After a lovely little LAN which was slightly cramped but very easy to get to in north Bristol, we are glad to be returning for our main event - a full weekend 96 hour LAN in the very well equipped [Westwoods Centre in Northleach](http://goo.gl/maps/jI6d). Onsite facilities include:

* Limited indoor sleeping, plenty of outdoor camping space
* On site bar (I'm assured prices shouldn't be too far from £2.50/pint)
* Nice on-site toilets, showers and changing rooms
* Spacious seating for ~80 people
* Consoling specific area
* Plenty of parking

Aside from the obvious gaming which is most certainly going to happen, we're aiming to throw in a few bonus features which you won't find at any old LAN. First off, on Friday night we'll throw a **free BBQ** (assuming the weather holds out of course!) and on Saturday will be a pub quiz whatever the weather! My job it to do everything to make sure people come back for LL9, and I've decided that the best way to do that is to spend the weekend being everyone's bitch. Free hot drinks delivered to your seat? No problem! Cooked breakfast (subject to a few quid changing hands) to wake up to? No problem! My well practised voice is at your disposal if you need to find some people to play games with, and I can normally suggest a game or two if you're out of ideas and don't fancy whatever we've got scheduled. Anything else you can think of I'll at least consider doing.

We're aware of the venue being a little difficult to get to by public transport, but it's not impossible to organise a pickup from a local station if that's the only thing holding you back from joining.

* Create a Steam community group. All PC gamers should have Steam already even if you don't like to purchase games with it. Steam is a very useful social networking tool that you can also use to host events.

* When you send your invites, make sure you have a list of programs for your guests to have installed before hand so you don't have the group waiting around for someone who came unprepared. Steam, Hamachi, and even some cheap/free fallback games like [Quake Live](http://quakelive.com) are a good start.

Our idea is to try and get our local Holiday Inn to let us rent out their conference room for a day or even two so we can try and get this tournament hosted, but we don’t know how to go about this, or what we’d even need to get this going. We’re looking to have a small entrance fee to cover the costs/prizes for winning the tournament and we’re also looking to cast this over Justin.tv or own3d.tv; again we’re lost in the details.

Unfortunately I believe our eyes are bigger than our stomachs in this whole thing, we don’t necessarily have the funding, nor do we have the sponsorships, so I come to you guys for advice.. HELP!

Initially we couldn't even find each other, then we figured that out and then the games would just stall and lag out on us. Now the games keep giving out of sync errors. Any suggestions on how to make it work properly.
The networking stuff: Cisco e3000 router and Cisco 2950 series 24 port switch.
We tried all connecting wireless... that didn't work very well and the games lagged out. Should we just all run static ip's to the switch and call it good? If anyone has a quick way for us to set those each time we play, that would be cool. An .exe or something to that extent.

March 2nd - 4th: 200 Person LAN @ Atlas networks datacenter
[http://g.co/maps/crfvg](http://g.co/maps/crfvg)

**200 Person LAN:**

After selling out in /hours/ of my garage LANs I got to thinking... There hasn't been a large scale LAN in Seattle in a very long time. So me and a few LAN buddies got together and after countless hours of searching we finally found a venue in downtown Seattle and can make this happen!

**Cost is $45**
(We are running this at zero profit. Any excess $$ will be donated to charity. Likely Child's Play since we all have close ties to Penny Aracde)

Full 48 hours!
Start is 5pm on the 2nd
End is 5pm on the 4th

**JIMMY JOHNS sandwiches provided on Saturday! **

You get 32"" of table space and 3 amps of power. If you need more space or power than that then you are welcome to buy multiple seats.

A seating chart will likely come later, waiting on the visio drawing of the space.

**WHAT TO BRING:**

Computer,
Monitor,
Keyboard,
Mouse,
Power strip (no daisy chaining power strips please),
Cables,
Headphones (no speakers allowed),

You can also bring a cooler (as long as it fits within your space under the table) as long as there's no water ice.
Additionally you can bring your own chair if you want, Just try to keep it out of the way when you aren't at your desk.

**PARKING:**

We have 50 spots reserved in the Starbucks Center parking lot out front for attendees, plus there is lots of free street parking around the area. We will likely be providing a parking pass for those parking lot spaces, first come first served at time of LAN checkin. It would be advisable to carpool!
(We tried to get more but they needed at least 60% left open for the business in the Starbucks center that are open on the weekend)

**NEARBY HOTEL:**

Need to sleep? Yeah... I know... Sleeping at a LAN... Lame... But some of us are getting old!

We might have an area set aside for some crash space. It wont be a separate area though so LAN noise will likely interfere.

But if you want to get a hotel there's a Silver Cloud Inn .8 miles north, On 1st Ave, next to Safeco Field
[http://www.silvercloud.com/seattlestadium/](http://www.silvercloud.com/seattlestadium/)

**DIRECTIONS:**

Google map link to the Location:
http://g.co/maps/crfvg

To get to the actual LAN space is a little more complex.

Go all the way to the end of Lander St, turn right at the train tracks, follow the road along the tracks (on the west side of the starbucks center), You will eventually make it to a small parking area. That is the Load/Unload area. Entrance to the LAN is on the loading dock (you will see the gathering of geeks).",,False,self,t5_2rggr,False,,,True,t3_pq4rx,http://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/comments/pq4rx/200_person_lanparty_in_seattle/,
