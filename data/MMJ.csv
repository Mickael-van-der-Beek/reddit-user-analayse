Here's the state of [/r/Project420](http://www.reddit.com/r/Project420) as of December:

---

The ""Cannabis: Legalization, Education, Acceptance, Reform"" Agenda: 

To increase the public awareness and political importance of the issues listed here:

-the harms of cannabis/hemp prohibition

-the benefits and relative safety of cannabis/hemp

-the alternatives to cannabis/hemp prohibition

-the means to implement those alternatives

-the massive public support for this issue

Project420:

An attempt to further the C:LEAR Agenda by uniting any and all interested groups to organize massive, world-wide, peaceful demonstrations on April 20th, 2012.

[We have an instructional guide for organizing a pro-cannabis demonstration in your city](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B5dE1uUgOQHrY2MxODJkMGYtODJhNC00YzdiLTk0ODYtODlhZjAzZjZmYTNh).

**[PM TrouM4n if you'd like to organize a rally in your city or want more information](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=TroutM4n)**

---

We have a domain name registered, which currently redirects to the /r/project420 subreddit:

[http://www.clearagenda.org](http://www.clearagenda.org)

-Right now, we're working on getting our website up and running to solidify and professionalize our web presence. It will provide a central location to organize our volunteers and a professional public face for our efforts. Anyone looking to help out with the website please [PM TrouM4n for more information](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=TroutM4n)

-We really need to get more people involved in organizing their own demonstrations. We have over 1,600 subscribers in [/r/Project420](http://www.reddit.com/r/Project420) and so far only 9 of us have volunteered to organize a rally in our hometowns. I know it can seem like a daunting task, but what we're talking about is exercising our right to free speech in order to educate our fellow citizens about an unjust law affecting us all. The great part is that you won't have to do it alone. If you reach out, there are quite a few people and organizations that will be willing to help with guest speakers, promotions, etc.

I’d like her to try pot, so please share you marijuana &amp; cancer stories – it might just prolong her life.",mymotherhascancer,22,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMJ/comments/sd2u9/my_mother_has_terminal_cancer_but_not_eating_is/,"Xpost from askreddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sctav/my_mother_has_terminal_cancer_but_not_eating_is/)
Please forgive the multiple xposts – looking for both a wide and targeted audience.  
Members of Reddit, a favor.  Can you please share with me stories and anecdotes around marijuana use and the treatment of cancer.  Whether it was/is you or a family member, I’d love to compile them and present them to my mother.  Although I’m in favor of encouraging her use, I want to present a balanced and fair opinion, so don’t just give me the favorable stuff.  Any experiences, good and bad would be most welcome. 
Backstory:
My mother has terminal cancer.  While breast cancer has a 80% survival rate, it seems that my mother will not be one of them, as the cancer has metastasized and spread to her lungs, liver and bone mass.  This may well be her last year with us.  I love her and will miss her dearly.
Her treatment is going well, and managing her illness as well as can be expected.  However, her nausea is extreme and her weight is dangerously low, she can’t bring herself to eat or keep food down when she does.  They are exploring options for how to get nutrition in her, all of which in her condition are dangerous.  
My parents are upper middle class, educated, law abiding, scientifically-minded people of some means.  They are, and have always have been, opposed to recreational drug use (alcohol aside).  I have been an on again, off again pot user for almost 18 years now, and a fully function happy adult with a nice house, wife and kids.  My extended family is somewhat aware of this.  

I want to encourage my mom to consider marijuana to treat her eating difficulties.  I live in MA, so use is not a crime anymore, though far from legal.  
I would like to collect lots of stories, hopefully positive (but want to present a balanced view if my mother is to consider it) and present them to my mother in the hope she will try it and be able to live a better quality and longer life than she is at present if she does.
Many, many thanks in advance.

Apologies for the throw away, but of course this is a relatively private matter and since its somebody else’s privacy at stake, it seemed best just in case.  

TL;DR – My mother is dying from not eating (and cancer) and I want your pot vs cancer stories to help her decide if that something she should try.

1370233000.0,22,self.MMJ,1fk8gi,An explanation of why cannabis is a medical drug for the purposes of treating disease. -xpost,Mach10X,22,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMJ/comments/1fk8gi/an_explanation_of_why_cannabis_is_a_medical_drug/,"I recently took the time in another subreddit comment to write up an argument against the the those that argue cannabis is not a real drug, or that it should be treated any differently from other drugs.  Many will say that cannabis does not prevent, treat, or cure any disease.

It certainly does **treat** many diseases, I wonder if the people making these arguments have done any research on what diseases cannabis does treat.  Perhaps they believe that cannabis only treats the symptoms and not the cause of a disease but this is hardly grounds to not call it a drug by pharmaceutical standards.

Wikipedia has a couple of great definitions for what a drug is.

The broad definition of a drug:
&gt;A drug is a substance which may have medicinal, intoxicating, performance enhancing or other effects when taken or put into a human body or the body of another animal and is not considered a food or exclusively a food. 

And the pharmaceutical definition of a drug:
&gt;A drug is a chemical substance used in the treatment, cure, prevention, or diagnosis of disease or used to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being.

**Here's some examples of commonly used drugs and how they work:**

* β-lactam antibiotics kills bacteria by interfering with the construction of their cell walls
* antiviral drugs kill viruses indirectly by effectively neutering their ability to reproduce or enter a host cell
* opiates work by altering your Nociceptor (pain receptors) so you feel less pain
* SSRI's help depression and anxiety by inhibiting  presynaptic cells from absorbing seratonin
* Simethicone cures gas yet has no interaction with your body chemistry or cells at all: it simply decreases the surface tension bubbles in your digestive system yet it's still a drug.

**Here's a list of diseases or issues that cannabis treats: [LINK to a full list here](http://www.unitedpatientsgroup.com/resources/illnesses-treatable)**

* Cannabis treats multiple sclerosis and other immune diseases by interacting with the CB2 receptor and effectively calms the immune system from attacking nerves (myelin).
* Cannabis assists in cancer treatments and controlling tumor growth by selectively increasing apoptosis and TRB3 expression in tumor cells but not in normal tissues.
* Cannabis treats glaucoma by interacting with the CB1 receptor and works by decreasing intraoccular pressure.

I can keep going on, but I feel that I've made my point.  Perhaps with a bit more understanding of what drugs are and how they operate at the microscopic level people can gain some understanding of why cannabis is a powerful drug.

I'll leave you with this quote by the DEA's Chief Administrative Law Judge Francis Young from 1988:

&gt;In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume. For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response. By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death. Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest **therapeutically active** substances known to man. By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care",,False,self,t5_2qood,1370234054.0,,,True,t3_1fk8gi,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMJ/comments/1fk8gi/an_explanation_of_why_cannabis_is_a_medical_drug/,

The pot leaf’s image pervades popular culture, from Bob Marley T-shirts to billboards for Showtime and the Ohio State Buckeyes. So what the problem with legalizing it.

(Repost because it's more relevant here).,blakgodaftermath,21,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMJ/comments/9tmmh/la_city_atty_trying_to_shut_down_dispensaries/,"LA City Attorney, Carmen ""Nuch"" Trutanich, has been all over the media trying to convince Los Angeles that a pesticide used to kill Mexican fire ants is evidence that medical cannabis provided by dispensaries is poisonous and supporting Mexican drug cartels. Having abandoned the flawed interpretation of the California Supreme Court's decision in People v. Mentch, Mr. Trutanich and LA County District Attorney Steve Cooley have now latched onto toxic reefer as their latest justification for shuttering LA's pot shops.

According to Trutanich, three samples of medical marijuana from ""controlled buys"" by undercover LAPD were tested by an FDA laboratory. On these samples, Mr Trutanich said the lab found high concentrations of an insecticide used to kill fire ants in Mexico. Trutanich claims this Mexican fire ant insecticide is evidence that LA medical cannabis is being supplied by the Mexican drug cartels.

Except...

There are no Mexican fire ants. There is the notorious red imported fire ant - solenopsis invicta - but that's from Brazil, not Mexico. Those fire ants were accidently imported into the US in the 1930's then spread across the southern United States. Fire ants were never found in Mexico, until they crossed the Texas border into northern Mexico a few years back. But even if expatriate Texan fire ants have decamped to Mexico, what does that prove about the origin of marijuana in Los Angeles dispensaries? If a cannabis dispensary uses chopsticks to pull marijuana buds from jars does that mean that the marijuana is being supplied by Chinese spies?

Pesticide testing is not a trivial exercise. It requires big, expensive, exquisitely sensitive machines that are capable of detecting just a few molecules. More importantly, pesticide testing requires a large plant sample to produce precise results. EMA, the largest testing lab in California requires a minimum 200 gram sample. So, did Los Angeles dispensaries sell Mr. Trutanich's undercover cops three half-pound bags of weed? That's an interesting scenario... ""I'll take a brownie, an eighth of Kush, and... throw in half a pound of that Sour D."" It's more likely that Mr. Trutanich would have had much smaller samples tested, with a much higher risk of error in the testing.

But what's this insecticide poisoning cannabis patients in LA? Well, it's a bit more complex than Mr Trutanich would have you believe. The insecticide that Nuch found in his big bag of herb was bifenthrin. Bifenthrin belongs to a very common class of insecticides called pyrethroids. The most common pyrethroid is pyrethrum, which is made from chrysanthemums. Pyrethrum is considered safe enough for use on organic fruits, herbs and vegetables throughout the world, including cannabis. See, most pyrethroids aren't all that toxic, except to fish and some insects. However, they're not that good at stopping fire ants. Nothing is.

What's with this whole Mexican angle? Mr Trutanich claims that bifenthrim is not used in California and by implication that its use is restricted to less enlightened places, such as Mexico. But Mr. Trutanich is dead wrong. According to pesticideinfo.org, California farmers used 107,000 pounds of bifenthrim on their crops in 2007. They used it on corn, almonds, strawberries, even wine grapes. Fifty tons of it.

What messages should we take away from Trutanich's Cassandra call? That the City Attorney and the County DA will say anything in their attempt to close LA's medical cannabis collectives and that you might wish to keep medical cannabis away from your aquarium. Remember that in June 2009, state drug warriors had their budgets slashed 20% in Sacramento. Medical marijuana remains the lowest hanging fruit for prosecutors and narcs to make cases and boost their stats. Certainly easier than busting those Mexican drug cartels.

Trutanich stated to FOX NEWS ""it's not enough to say conclusively that this dope is coming from here (Mexico), okay. but? but, you know, if it quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, you know, chances are that if you look a little closer, you may be dealing with a duck.""

Well... if it thinks like a duck, it might be the LA City Attorney.

California cannabis patients should be protected from contaminants in their medicine. That protection comes from intelligent regulations, something that the City Attorney's office has been stalling for two years. Perhaps it's time we stopped wasting tax money busting legitimate medical marijuana facilities and started researching how cannabis can be used more effectively as a medicine.

INFO: On Tuesday, April 6, the California Senate Judiciary Committee approved Senate Bill 129 (SB 129), which would protect medical marijuana patients from being fired by their employers for consuming their medicine during off hours. 

As State Senator Mark Leno, who introduced the bill, put it: **""When Californians approved the compassionate use of cannabis, they never intended for it to apply only to unemployed people.""** Indeed, SB 129 will ensure responsible medical cannabis users keep their jobs, while also containing specific language against on the job impairment and exempting from the law safety-sensitive positions such as health care providers, school bus drivers, and operators of heavy equipment. 

Now, SB 129 moves to a vote in front of the full Senate. We've got to ensure our senators understand the broad support for this common sense legislation. ",,False,self,t5_2qood,False,,,True,t3_gr0rx,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMJ/comments/gr0rx/californians_please_sign_this_petition_support/,

My Uncle has been suffering from MS for about 10 years. We're not that close, only see each other on Christmas and Easter, and he is also my Uncle through marriage (married my mom's sister). I have noticed his quality of life slowly deteriorate: he is not social, is rarely happy, and according to my aunt, is in constant, chronic pain :( This makes me really sad and I really want to recommend cannabis to help him out.

I'm not worried about what my family or anyone would think of me for bringing it up (while they don't know the extent of my ent-status, they know I have used, that my friends use, etc). I just want him to take me seriously. He and my aunt and, to be honest, my entire mom's side of the family, are very conservative politically and also uneducated (I'm a first generation college student, represENT). I know that his doctor suggested it but that he shot the idea down. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for how to talk about this in a serious, persuasive way? Maybe anything he could read? He has two kids, 12 and 10, so I would imagine that a lot of his concern would be them. Also, he works for Fuji Film and travels a lot for work. He probably feels that he wants to be on top of his game all the time. But honestly, if he is in chronic pain, how can he be?

Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated!
Thanks so much in advance &lt;3",,False,self,t5_2qood,False,,,True,t3_pa4ot,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMJ/comments/pa4ot/help_recommending_medical_mj_to_my_conservative/,

Also would it be recommended to take MMJ and therapy? How would I go about getting a card and what would be the cost? 

**Edit**: Thank you all for the informative responses and discussions. I had a mental health evaluation done and they told me I had some social anxiety, some eating disorder, and chronic depression. They told me that counseling would be able to help me with these things a lot but I might need to take some medication.

A gram lasts me over a week.

 I had put a few drops of [Frankincense 20% essential oil blend](http://www.nowfoods.com/Personal-Care/Products/Aromatherapy/Blends/Frankincense-Oil-1oz.htm) in a foot bath w/epsom salts and suddenly found myself grinning like I had used a few inhales of a regular strain. OK... didn't know if it was coincidence what so I tried it several more times and finally dabbed a few drops on achy muscles (frankincense makes a mild warming relaxing sensation on the skin). The grin and mild intoxication hit faster when directly applied. oh, and when an enteric migraine started to hit and vaping mmj didn't help fast enough I put a couple of drops on my temples and wrists and was rewarded with faster pain and nausea relief

I have googled my best to find out if others have this effect and only found this account [here](http://herbs.mxf.yuku.com/sreply/25709122/Frankincense-has-Psychoactive-Properties)

so I am curious am I an oddball or is this a common but unreported effect among those who have used frankincense.

1365592628.0,12,self.MMJ,1c219v,"The Illinois House will be voting on MMJ this week, House Bill 1. So I sent this email to 89 members of the House and Senate (every email I could find of theirs on the internet). Feel free to modify it and use this letter in campaigns in your state.",HillZone,15,3,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMJ/comments/1c219v/the_illinois_house_will_be_voting_on_mmj_this/,"The letter is too long to post here (15,000 character limit). 

So here's the part of the letter where I summarize, I think it's quite powerful. If you like it, feel free to use it:

Let’s review the facts:

1.  Cannabis contains many cannabinoids; THC is only one of these. THC is already FDA approved as a schedule III medication. Ironically the only cannabinoid people fear is this legal one. The other cannabinoids have medical benefits far beyond the scope of mere THC, and people deserve access to them.

2.  The FDA cannot regulate cannabis. It does not review unpatentable plants, as per their guidelines. Cannabis is an herb and therefore considered a “dietary supplement” by the FDA.

3.  Smoking is not required.  Vaporization, eating, and tinctures are preferred methods of consumption. Smoking marijuana, however, does not cause lung cancer. And as shown by UCLA’s Dr. Donald Tashkin in 2006, it may actually offer a slight protective effect against lung cancer compared to non-smokers.

4.  The body produces endocannabinoids, the “brains own marijuana” as Scientific American referred to them. Cannabinoids tap into this important homeostatic regulation system in the human body, and this explains why cannabinoids work so well in treating so many conditions that non-cannabinoid medicines cannot.

5.  The word “marijuana” was a Mexican slang word adopted to make cannabis and hemp sound foreign. Marijuana was first outlawed on the Mexican border and in the South. Even though racism is unacceptable today, we still use the word officially today and it should be a reminder. Cannabis wasn’t banned for scientific reasons, but rather for racist reasons. The word “marijuana” is even revealing of drug war racism today – a new Jim Crow.

6.  Cannabis is objectively, scientifically safer than alcohol, tobacco, and most pharmaceutical drugs. In 1988, the DEA’s administrative law judge Francis Young called cannabis “the safest therapeutically active substance known to man.”  However, we know the DEA ignores all contrary evidence. With a clear financial incentive to maintain the status quo, the DEA continues to claim cannabis isn't medicine because there isn’t enough science, while simultaneously restricting research to the NIDA supply. Police are not doctors or scientists, and should not be making medical decisions.

7.  Alcohol prohibition was a failure, and marijuana prohibition has failed similarly. States are beginning the inevitable process of legalization, one by one. With $16.5 trillion in national debt, and with yearly budget deficits, this change cannot come soon enough. Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron estimates that marijuana legalization is worth $85.6 billion per year in savings and new tax revenue. 

8.  Legalizing marijuana does not increase use according to the data in MMJ states and in other countries where it is legal for recreational purposes. This is because a legal market gets rid of the forbidden-fruit effect. MMJ states have also seen decreases, not increases, in traffic fatalities, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, as well as a lower suicide rate.

9.  Medical cannabis improves quality of life for terminally ill and seriously ill patients for which conventional medicines offer little or mediocre relief. Cannabinoids kill cancer cells, and medical cannabis can save lives.



___________________________________
And these were my closing statements:

In Illinois, HB1 will be the strictest MMJ law in the United States. National support for the MMJ issue is at over 81%. On Monday, Maryland passed their medical cannabis bill 42-4 in the Senate and will become the 19th state to legalize MMJ. The first medical marijuana dispensary is opening its doors in Washington D.C. this month. There is no reason to let Illinois fall behind on this important issue.

Perhaps one day you, a colleague, a friend or family member may benefit from this legislation. Terminal illness can befall anyone at any time, and nobody wants to imagine the government making life even harder when on the brink of death. Just ask L.A. City Councilman Bill Rosendahl. After a cancer diagnosis he began using medical cannabis. He recently said “life is now worth living” thanks to his medical cannabis regimen.

Our laws should be based on science, reason, and compassion. Please support HB1, the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act.

Thank you, and I look forward to reading your response.

I was bounced from doctor to doctor for more than five years because they could not figure out what I had until I met my current neurologist. He was able to diagnose what I had within a few minutes and worked hard to help me figure out the best treatment. Now he is a top class doctor for females with seizures so many people travel to see him. However, my neurologist does not practice in Connecticut, therefore he cannot help me get my registration card according to the current guidelines.

Since I am not willing to leave my neurologist, my next step is to find a psychologist that is willing to allow me to use cannabis for my PTSD.

What are my rights?,PwninOBrian,12,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMJ/comments/lejuv/was_pulled_over_for_a_traffic_violations_w_mmj_in/,"Long story short, my registration sticker is missing, and I was pulled over yesterday. The officer was very bored, apparently, because he carded my passengers, and pulled me out of the car for a field sobriety test. I was NOT medicated at the time.

One thing he asked me was if I had any drugs or weapons in the car. I had a small amount (~1g) of medical marijuana in my car, along with my prescription. I told him ""no"", however, because I assumed that he would need probable cause to search, and I didn't feel like explaining to him that I had drugs in the car legally, as that would cause further complications.

I'm pretty sure I did this the wrong way, from a legal standpoint. What are my rights? Am I allowed to have mmj in my car? Do I admit this to an officer? I'm under the impression that it's a pretty gray area as to how I should handle it, but I would love any advice/ anecdotes you have.

Symptoms have been intermittent, but I am having a hard time pin-pointing what the problem is...usually I can identify the precipitating factors, but this has been much harder the past while.

I worry that perhaps my tolerance is effecting my medicating? Or perhaps I'm just feeling hopeless right now. I should mention that I moderate caffiene and alcohol and excercise regularly.

This is a repost from /r/cannabis but I want to get the word out to everyone who can benefit.


Hi All,

The bill in the MA legislature to permit medical marijuana is stuck in committee, and has been delayed until next year.

Lots of people went to the State House last week to lobby for it. And the word from MassCann is that committee chairman Sanchez is the ""roadblock.""

Now is the time for everyone to send him an email. Be polite, don't complain, (or refer to him as ""roadblock,"" etc). Just urge that he allow the bill come up for a vote, and speak of compassion for the sick.

If you are a constituent of his (the district covers parts of Brookline &amp; Boston) by all means mention that. But write him in any case -- there is usually no way to tell where you are located by looking at an email address. You could be a constituent. Even with an out of state college address, you might be a constituent away at school. Besides, politicians like to be on good terms with people outside their district. They might run for higher office later.

So get those letters flooding in!

His address: Rep.JeffreySanchez@hou.state.ma.us

Funny thing, doctors, (who do surgery), lawyers, bankers and politicians run free.
 

If the public voted for testing on Politicians, remember, marijuana is a class one drug, the law on weed would change so fast your head would spin. If caught, the politician would lose their job, insurance, and pension, and have a criminal record. If testing was voted in, the politicians would reclassify the drug and make it totally legal.
 

The church should back having politicians tested, we are not asking for legalization, just the opposite, lets just make a level playing field.

So I wonder if they're being cheeky about the fact that it's a damn theft that they can charge you $1000 for some fancy preparation of cannabinoids that you could grow for free. 

Nabiximols (Sativex) is the worst offender, because it's literally just a strain selected hash oil spray with a 1:1 ratio of thc to cbd. Any dispensary in Colorado or California could produce the same thing.

It just takes one email.",P5eudonym,12,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMJ/comments/opfpv/rmmj_yall_have_been_strong_in_promoting_medical/,"The show ""Weed Wars"" brings to mainstream america the many positives of marijuana.  It shows the health benefits of medicinal use, and portrays the once taboo cannabis culture in america as ever permeating.  We cannabis users are not all just lazy drug addicts.  We have jobs, we have families, we have responsibilities that marijuana does not hinder any more than the responsible use of any other recreational drug.  We may suffer from injury or pain in which marijuana is the only medically viable option supported by doctors around the world.  And as always, we are capable of making mistakes just like everyone else, but most use cannabis as a life enhancer, not a crutch.  If a viewer were to consider critically, a cannabis user from the show is just as human as they are.

That's why the longer ""Weed Wars"" is on the air, the better.  Personally I enjoy the show, but it goes deeper than that.  The longer the show is on the air, the more likely the average american will have seen it, and the more likely the show will have been accepted into the television culture of modern america.  Currently some people have never heard of the show, thus never given it a chance.  Currently many people see the show as a fluke, a television stunt that will gain as much credence as marijuana legalization movement itself (in their opinion).  But not if we show that there's a market desire for the show to stay on the air.  Won't you take a few minutes out of your day to [email](http://corporate.discovery.com/contact/viewer-relations/) Discovery with some appreciation for the show and a desire for a second season?  I am unsure whether or not Discovery has a second season planned, but our communicative support can only help convince them that there's a high demand and a strong plurality to keep this show on the air.  This is a path culturally, slowly but surely, we can promote marijuana acceptance on a national level!

I was also smoking cannabis at the time, and eventually had a few strong panic attacks and may have made it worse.   I have found that when I smoke now my feelings of dissasociation are worse the next day and my anxiety is much higher.  

It is because of this that I am interested in trying to treat myself with CBD.  Its anti psychotic and anti- anxiety properties should be helpful.  I am moving to a medical state (Cali) soon but wanted to get a headstart on my research on the subject.

How much of a CBD to THC ratio should there be to help me get relief and not make me feel worse?  Are there any tinctures or edibles that are purely CBD?  If so what are they called and how effective will they be at helping me?  Any and all information is welcome and appreciated!  I can't wait to try CBD cause i have a feeling it will really help me!  I am looking more for products that have very little or no THC and high amounts of CBD.  the more bang for my buck the better!
