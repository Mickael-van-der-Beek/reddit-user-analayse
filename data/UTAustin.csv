There is a scam going around west campus trying to get you to subscribe to the Austin American statesman, the salesman actually works for the paper, and you will get it delivered, but there is more to the picture. In my case, the woman fabricated a story that someone living in my complex was delivering the paper in exchange for a scholarship. The paper would be free of charge for a whole semester, all they ask is that we tip the delivery driver. The catch is that you have to pay the salesman all of the tips in advance, which she claimed was only 20 dollars. Now realizing that it was a ploy to get me to subscribe, I questioned her and she informed me that if it was a ploy, it would be $60. I ended up subscribing anyways, because 20 bucks for an entire semester of papers is not that bad of a deal, and just ignored the little cover story. Come to find out, she lied about the price as well. Its 20 bucks every 4 weeks and the payment is recurring. I contacted the statesman and they confirmed that the woman lied about everything and happily refunded my money.

Artistic enlightenment, proximity to food, and privacy are just a few!  Below, I've listed some of my personal favorites:

**burdine bathrooms** are great: tons of graffiti.  not a great place to really let one rip, but you get some mental stimulation from the debates on whether or not god exists, and there was a fantastic drawing of an anime shemale there a couple semesters ago that really focused a lot on the dick.  Remember: belly laughs help with the digestion process.

**student union** upstairs: this one is more for ambiance.  wood paneling, classy natural lighting, the list could go on.  Unfortunately, heavily trafficked so once again, not good for particularly gassy shits unless you have no shame.  this is unfortunate as there is a chick-fil-a directly underneath.

the ultimate, however, would have to be in the **Sanchez** building.  It's mostly education majors of some sort, which is about 70% female.  This means the men's rooms are ghost towns.  Not particularly inspiring, but a good place to head to after eating a baconator at the wendy's in jester.

Don't help him! He doesn't need your help; he just uses it to guilt you into giving him money.

Sorry I don't have a picture, but he's easy to recognize. He's black and pretty ragged looking. He has crazy-looking eyes (I guess due to being blind) but does not wear sunglasses.

I actually fell for his scam several months ago, and it pains me to see him doing the same to other people.

1345827352.0,51,self.UTAustin,yrfzd,Friendly reminder for anyone who has a bicycle!,BurrDurrMurrDurr,60,9,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/yrfzd/friendly_reminder_for_anyone_who_has_a_bicycle/,"It's a peeve of mine to see so many bikes improperly locked or ""secured"" via a cable lock!
**I'm not sure of the exact statistics but I think UT is in the top 5 (2nd?) of bike theft universities and surrounding areas**

1. Invest in a good U-lock, cable locks are trash and can be clipped in seconds no matter the diameter. I personally carry two locks (nice bike/wheels), Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit ($100) and an On-Guard Bulldog lock ($30). 

2. Properly secure your bike! DON'T LOCK THE FRONT WHEEL ONLY! It takes less than a minute for someone with a wrench to unscrew your front wheel and bam, bike gone. Don't lock like this: [Well at least my front wheel is safe](http://i.imgur.com/tU6xG.png), [Oh no only the frame is left!](http://i.imgur.com/XLhAy.png)
Instead lock like this: [Good day sir](http://i.imgur.com/VCfxr.png). If you rock two locks like I do: [safe](http://i.imgur.com/UFrW3.png).

3. Always make sure that what you are securing your bike to is secure itself! Unfortunately there are a number of rack on campus and **tons of racks off campus (west campus)** that are broken, rusted, loose, not bolted down at all, or otherwise compromised in some way. I have seen, first hand and in the flesh, two guys on 26th hoisting an entire rack with 3 bikes attached to it onto their pickup truck! (We stopped them) 

4. If you live in an apartment complex I'd recommend taking the bike up to your room instead of locking outside your complex. It might seem inconvenient but it eliminates any doubt about your bike over night.

5. **PLEASE TRY TO OBSERVE TEXAS BICYCLE LAWS. ALSO, WEAR A HELMET**. I feel like this advice is vain since I know most people won't do either but please try! I'll buy you a drink (SERIOUSLY!). I'm a guy with short-ish hair so helmets don't really bother me but I even if you are a girl or have long hair, better safe than sorry (Think brain-dead/coma/Oh a fall going under 15mph wouldn't even be bad right? That's what this [guy](http://myweb.cableone.net/edmondsonm/Hpim0507.JPG) said).


6. If you like to ride beyond commuting join the UT cycling club! Or at least call me up for some rides! :D There are plenty of social rides around Austin

7. Register your bike with UT Parking and Transportation. They help as much as they can in tracking down your bike if it's stolen. Also the sticker is a good deterrent! You can do it online [here](http://www.utexas.edu/parking/transportation/biking/bicycle_register.html). Or you can fill out a paper form and get your sticker immediately at the bicycle service stop on Speedway. 


**TL;DR**

1. Get a U-lock. Cables are trash and give you cancer

2. Lock properly

3. Location and condition of where you lock is important

4. Same as #3

5. Don't be a dumbfuck!

6. Ride with me :D Or UT cycling, or social rides. Just ride more.

7. Register your bike with UT Parking and Transportation!

The University knows this and has hired dozens of personnel to scour every inch of campus to find illegally parked cars. Though there is a need for parking enforcement to combat assholes who can think they can park anywhere, UT borders on the edge of profiteering. It would be a wise idea to double-check and triple-check wherever you might be parking, because the signage can be very confusing. (Or you could just ride your bike.)

Also, it is to be noted that UT has a police force that's manned and equipped to deal with a catastrophe on the level of the [Charles Whitman Shooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman), and for lack of better things to do, they spend their time handing out lots of minor traffic violations and public intoxication tickets to freshmen returning from West Campus late at night. This also means if you're a weed smoker, for the love of god, don't smoke on campus because it's VERY easy to get caught and it will get you kicked out of the dorms immediately.

* **Living On-Campus Freshman Year**

Take the conventional time-tested wisdom of staying on-campus your Freshman year (and maybe even your Sophomore year too) as it LARGELY contributes to not just the ""freshman"" experience, but the college experience as a whole. It makes it a lot easier to make and meet new friends when you live and eat in the same place.

It makes dating Freshman year much easier (although I don't recommend that you only eat in, the west commercial avenue of campus, AKA The Drag, has got some neat places well within walking distance).

If you intend to start off your college career living off-campus, you *will* miss out on an integral part of relationship building. There's a reason modern universities are structured this way. Also, if you live off-campus, you can't sleep in ten minutes 'til your next class then fumble out of bed to get there on time. Not that I recommend it, but the option's there should you need it.

* **Living Off-Campus**

I've often found that living off-campus is more feasible and enjoyable when sharing an apartment or house with REALLY GOOD friends (Note: not singular 'friend') that you've made the year prior in college. Someone with the same work ethic and base principles, someone you know you can talk to for help in any form or situation, someone with whom silence isn't awkward, someone who you might eagerly anticipate talking to after a long/exciting day. They don't necessarily even have to be the same major, although that helps too. 

So start making friends the moment you get here, keep and nurture your relationships with the best of 'em, and don't stop until you've a handful of legitimate candidates. I mean, these sorts of people are out there doing the same looking for you.

* **Cafeteria Food VS. Cooking All Your Own Meals**

As per dorm food, students often complain about how bad the food is once they've eaten it regularly. Although I haven't eaten at a dorm cafeteria in a while, the company of the other people far outweighs the supposed mediocrity of the food.

But as a student who has to cook for himself on a small budget, I see nothing for them to complain about. I often have to make long trips to the nearest grocery store by bus, judiciously pick food that will offer decent nutrition for the price, carry all my groceries onto the bus by myself, then finally get home, perform contortions of the most baffling sort just trying to fit everything into my college-staple mini fridge, then finally *cook* my food, and serve it. All of this totaling maybe 3-4 hours. *But damn if it isn't rewarding.*

And I'm not the greatest chef either, so yeah-- the convenience, variety, and value of the cafeteria food should be considered with appreciation and financial perspective.

* **Greek Life**

**EDIT:** My impression of Greek life has been moved to the comments as it did not fitfully address the lifestyle. Read [u/Purplehooloovoo](http://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1cvxr4/advice_for_incoming_freshman_regarding_life_at_ut/c9kllcv)'s perspective on Greek life at UT.

* **Co-Ops**

**EDIT:**[u/carpetstain](http://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1cvxr4/advice_for_incoming_freshman_regarding_life_at_ut/c9krsqb)'s thoughts and experiences of UT Co-ops.

There are a lot of co-ops on West Campus, they're highly NOT recommended for first-years. In my experience, they can be either Greek fraternities/sororities gone horribly right OR downright weird.

* **Additional Questions**

I know my shit. Ask away.

They're $3.50 a box and we'll be starting with all 8 flavors. And if things work out we'll be able to take credit cards!

Unfortunately we can't take online orders or pre-orders. Hope to see you there.

Wow - that was insane. Parked near 22nd and it took almost 30 minutes to get to 24th since we were stopped every few feet to make a sale! Hope we didn't disappoint anyone by being late.

My family has a long health history of weight-related problems like diabetes, heart problems, and other serious complications; the harsh reality of it all started showing up pretty recently, and I'm starting to get really scared and want to adopt a healthier lifestyle now, while I'm still young and capable. Maybe earn myself a few more years to live. 


I'm looking for someone(s?) to work out with who can help keep me motivated, and prefer someone who could use some motivation themselves. My self-consciousness kicks in with some serious anxiety whenever I go to the gym by myself, and I usually walk out with a hung head after a shameful ten minutes on the treadmill. So, I'd prefer someone who wouldn't be totally repulsed at the sight of sweat, wheezing red faces, or jiggly parts.  


Also, and probably most importantly, I'm looking for someone who knows how important (and difficult) sticking to a healthy diet is, and would be willing to kick my ass if I ever reach for a fried chicken leg or something; I'd definitely be happy to do the same. 


I don't really care about age/weight/gender and am open to anyone who's interested and dedicated, but if it's relevant at all to you I'm 21/F/180lb.

-----------------------------------------------------


1) The first floor of the older Pharmacy Building; there are two pharm school buildings and i'm talking about the one on the north side. This one is my personal favorite, I've held this location secret for years. I've been at UT for quite a while and have never seen more than 2 people at a time in there.


2) The second floor of the building that has the Blanton's gift shop and café. Talk about bathroom aesthetics.


3) Any of the odd floors of the NHB. Plenty of stalls? Si gracias Jefe LOL.


4) Parlin Hall. Brown granite/marble stalls/walls whenever the outside hallway is institutional white/seafoam green? Holy trippin balls Batman!


5) The new Bill Gates building. Several bathrooms on each floor + no one really is in that building yet = hnng


6) The second floor of the EPS building (the one on the same side of the east mall as the geoscience building). Even though the guy's bathroom is right next to the geoscience grad lounge, no one is ever there either.


7) Any of the upper stories of Welch, the chemistry building. Similar to above, never any heavy traffic, and a lot of stalls.


8) Bathrooms in the ECJ have a fckin weird white and black checkerboard tiling. Talk about make you go crosseyed while you're trying to piss/10

-------------------------------------------

Incoming freshman take heed: if you don't have time to make it to any of those in particular, just remember one rule: the further you get away from traffic in a building, the less occupied the bathrooms are. If you're in the SAC and you need to go dance with Deuce Bigalog, just go up a few stories and the bathrooms will be much less in use.

&gt; 
Colleagues,

&gt;As many of you may know, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) will no longer fund research at institutions that do not have a ""tobacco-free"" campus policy. Facing a deadline of March 1, 2012, The University of Texas at Austin is currently working to evaluate and adapt its current ""No Smoking"" policy, which will ultimately preserve tens of millions of dollars in funding for cancer research. In the days ahead we will consult the leadership of groups representing UT faculty, staff, and students.

&gt;As a premier research institution, UT considers cancer research to be vital to our core mission and our goal to help save lives and enhance public health. We will be working to develop policy that is consistent with the university's commitment to promoting the health, well-being, and safety of our students, faculty, staff, and visitors. Any new tobacco use policy will seek to complement other university health initiatives including smoking cessation programs, our sustainable green building design standards, and our efforts to adopt a campus culture of wellness for students, faculty, staff and visitors. Student Government passed a resolution in 2011 supporting a tobacco-free campus.

&gt;As we get closer to establishing compliant policy, which must be approved by the UT System, you may expect future communications regarding the details of its implementation. We realize a compliant policy may present challenges to those who use tobacco products. We hope to make a smooth transition with the continued support and resources offered here on campus.


As a heavy smoker, this is obviously going to be a great inconvenience to me, but from all of the egregious lack of smoking etiquette that my fellow students have demonstrated--I really can't blame the non-smokers. Everyday, I see smokers who shamelessly exhale clouds of smoke into large masses of people between classes, and I'm even put off by it on behalf of the non-smokers. They could at *least* find a non-offensive smokers cove or perform the dragon technique (where you cock your head and blow smoke vertically into the air so that it rises above the noses of people). This is mainly due to the fact that most college kids haven't been smoking for long enough to develop a sense of etiquette, but there's also a dash of self-centered-ness at work too. 


Though I think that an absolute banishment of tobacco is a bit extreme (and would would much prefer designated smoking areas),  from an ethical point of view--this argument is completely coherent. If there weren't some sort of cultural factors at work that are encouraging kids to smoke, then I wouldn't have started to willfully abuse my lungs 15 years ago. 


Anyhow, what do you UT redditors think about this?",,False,self,t5_2qy08,False,,,True,t3_piwhf,http://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/piwhf/the_proposed_smoking_ban_on_campus_thoughts/,

Join them in solidarity at the Human Rights Round-up now in the west mall to help make UT sweatshop free!

**Update**: all 18 protesters were arrested and charged with trespassing (class B misdemeanor) at 5:00 when the tower closed. President Powers never came to speak with them.
Back story: UT makes the most money on collegiate apparel in the world. Their over 4,000 factories are overseen by the FLA, who is supposed to moderate workplace conditions. Some members of this board include representatives from Nike, so pretty much the people on the board are the ones making the money from the sweatshops. The whole reason this ""occupy Powers' office"" occurred is because he has repeatedly REFUSED to meet with USAS (United Students Against Sweatshops) representatives and they wanted to make themselves heard. A member of USAS actually traveled to a few of these sweatshops in Central and South America and has video documentation of workers describing their workplace conditions. They are fired if they attempt to form unions and are deprived of even the simplest things such as using the bathroom during 12 hour work days. **The only thing USAS wants to do now is to get UT to stop working with the FLA and to instead work with the WCA (Worker Rights Consortium)** who already works with over 150 universities in the US and promotes fair workplace conditions.That's all they want Powers to do. But he refuses to speak with them. Mu guess is that he doesn't want to upset Nike who sponsors pretty much all the athletic events for UT. But who knows.

The traditional Thanksgiving day game against y'all has always been the highlight of the year for me - it either meant that I could crack a few jokes about it, or I would take a year of merciless ribbing.

I'll stay away from the standard cliches of ""Bad calls by the refs"" or ""you cheated"" or anything like that - it's just not true. The Aggies managed once again to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory as we've managed to do all year.

The main thing I came here to say is ""thank you.""



Thank you for 118 years of rivalry.

Thank you for keeping it classy when the Stack collapsed.

Thank you for the amazing halftime show today, paying homage to the 20th anniversary of Freddie Mercury's death, but also the great send-off you gave us - that ""Thanks ATM"" formation will be one of my most treasured memories, and one of the few pictures of other schools' bands I will keep with me forever.


I am not saying this on behalf of r/aggies, nor am I saying this on behalf of Aggies everywhere.

It is from the heart of one touched student to those who can read this.

Also maybe a tag about who your personal experiences will help the most (obviously if you recommend a bar near campus you might want to include a 21 yr old tag or something like it so freshman do not waste their time).

Food near campus that if you have not had you should try.

It is free admission, free parking, and one of the few places you can find the UT/A&amp;M rivalry still.  It is guaranteed to be a rowdy atmosphere full of college students, kids and family, and local soccer supporters.  If you are any of those, I urge to you to come support us on our mission to win conference.

(Disclosure: I posted this yesterday right before Reddit went down so it didn't see much traffic but here's my second encounter)

This morning, I was buying milk at Orange Mart literally mid-conversation with the Orange Mart cashier about if they were able to recover the license plate from the guy's car in their video footage. Then, this guy comes up next to me at the counter and asks the cashier for a pen and paper to write on, but I recognized the voice. I look up and IT'S HIM. It's the scumbag that sold me the bogus sound equipment.

At this point, my legs start shaking (I guess it's my inner pussy coming out). But there he is: 6' 0"" probably 210lbs (I'm 5' 10"", 150lbs for reference). I give a firm pat on the back followed by a subtle ""what's up dude"". He looks at me and I saw his eyes light up. He recognized me right away. I ask him about the sound equipment he sold me, why it's so shitty, and I want my money back. He says he doesn't have time right now (he was literally mid-transaction with another customer who he was about to con) and tries to give me his number to ""call him later"". Guess what? It's the same bogus number from the first time and I call him out on it. He then gives me another number saying it's his real phone number and I can call him later. So I pull out my phone and begin to call it, and he starts walking out of the store claiming his phone is ""in his car"". Knowing this is more bullshit being spewed out of his mouth I follow him to his car. He had a partner with him this time. The con and his partner get in their car and drive off but I managed to get their license plate and the car make/model:

Silver Toyota 4Runner with black rims and black racks on top. Plate: DT8 R972

IF YOU SEE THIS GUY IN WEST CAMPUS SELLING SOUND EQUIPMENT, DO NOT BUY FROM HIM AND ENCOURAGE ALL OTHERS TO AVOID HIM 

Other than that, ask me anything you want. This is literally one of the craziest/weirdest coincidences to happen to me in my life. I have his plate and I'm going to call the cops (again) now that I have his license plate. Last time, they said it was a civil issue and technically what the guy is doing is legal so they can't prosecute him. Maybe the new information will help.

I said no and he gave me an elaborate story about how he works for UT to help set up sound and audio equipment. The supplier/warehouse had given him an ""extra"" home theater system and he wanted to get rid of it for a deal. I told him to sell it online (Craigslist, eBay, etc.) but he said he had get rid of it because his boss was going to ""take it from him"" if he saw him with it. 

Anyways, long story short I bought the theater system from him for $300. The brand is Nexis Audio - it's a six piece home entertainment system with an MSRP of ""$1795.00"" (in quotes because it's bullshit). He was driving an older, silver/grey SUV with black rims and black racks on top. He was about 6'0"", 200lbs. with a tattoo in his right arm/shoulder. 

If you see this guy avoid him or report him. I like to think of myself as a smart guy, but hindsight is always 20/20 and I fucked up. Don't do the same.

* Need to get into Jester, but don't want to deal with the booths/crowds? Enter through the doors that are across the street from the PCL, near the Wendy's sign. It's generally a lot less crowded.

* If you want to avoid getting flyers handed to you altogether, learn to look ""through"" people rather than directly at them. This won't stop everyone, but it's easier than always having your iPod out. (Not that it's difficult to just say ""no,"" but it can be annoying if you have to pass through the West Mall multiple times a day.)

* This sounds self-explanatory, but if you're stuck on-campus for a long time, make sure to bring food *with* you. Eating on-campus adds up quickly, especially when it comes to snack food.

their email:

Dear [NAME],

We want to let you know that because we are retiring mail.utexas.edu from service, we are removing students' eligibility for this service in order to encourage them to move to UTmail. Alternatively, if you have recently left University employment then you have lost eligibility for that reason. Therefore, as of 3/1/2012, you will no longer be able to send, receive, or access messages from &lt;[MAILBOX]&gt;.

Until 3/1/2012, your UMBS mailbox will remain active, allowing you to:

1) Establish a new e-mail address on a different mail service. Students should sign up for a UTmail account at &lt;http://get.utmail.utexas.edu&gt;.

2) Notify your contacts of your new e-mail address.

3) Forward incoming e-mail from mail.utexas.edu to your new e-mail address until your mail.utexas.edu mailbox is deactivated on [EXPDATE]. (Instructions for doing this can be found on the UMBS Web site at &lt;http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/umbs-e-mail/743&gt;.)

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU

If you want to save any mail from your UMBS mailbox, you must do so BEFORE 3/1/2012. Once your mailbox has been deactivated, you WILL NOT be able to retrieve any messages and we will not be able to reactivate your mailbox.

IMPORTANT: Do not wait until the last minute to save your mail. You may not be able to access you mailbox on the actual day your account is deactivated, 3/1/2012.

If you have any questions, please contact the ITS Help Desk online at &lt;http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/&gt;.

I originally went to a different UT school as a CAP student this fall semester, but I plan on going to a local community college for financial reasons once winter break is over.

Anyway, while I was at the other UT system school, I struggled a lot with making friends. Even during orientation, I felt super awkward talking with other people in my group. Once class started, I guess I eventually got overwhelmed with how large the classes were that I eventually stopped caring about making friends and just focused on school. Not to mention that it didn't help that the university is a commuter school, and a bunch of people that went to high schools in the city already know each other, so they have their own cliques. 

Is it going to be any better at Austin? I'm pretty introverted, awkward, and I have a little bit of anxiety (although it's gotten somewhat better recently). Would it make a difference that I'm a transfer student and not an incoming freshman since people might have their own groups by then?

And if that's not enough to convince you, we also have: 

Big screen TVs,
Free drink tickets,
Raffles for Riot Swag, Razer gear, and more!

~~Lastly, if you're taking **PSY418, Statistics and Research Design** with Spivey, I've got one physical copy of *Statistics and Research Design^custom edition, Jackson&amp;Spivey (ISBN 978-1-4266-5038-3)*. It's custom, and I think the only way you can get it is through the Co-op. For the two required textbooks, the Co-op wants $100. [Some guy on Craigslist wants $63 for both](http://austin.craigslist.org/bks/3200469540.html). I'll give both to you for $30.~~

They're looking for big teams, and are also kind enough to match up individuals/smaller groups with other teams. *[Click here for more  information](http://scavhunt.refsmmat.com/about/how.html).*

If it looks like there's a big enough group here willing to band up and do this thing, I'd be down for being Team Captain; if anyone else wants to help out, having another captain would also be helpful. 


**If you're serious about going through with forming a reddit team**, leave a comment here **AND** PM me with your details (name &amp; email-address) so I can get an approximate headcount in and submit a rough team size.

University of Houston's reddit page is pretty active, and they've managed to form an awesome community outside of the internet. With an event like a scavenger hunt, it'd be great to see /r/UTAustin get together and do the same. We can have a meetup beforehand and I will bring sliced bread.

We have created a new file-sharing network at UT. (A successor to the old Direct-Connect one.) And we are opening it up to the public.

Some features of this new network:

* Complete anonymity (Yes I am serious, for downloading, uploading, **and publishing**.)

* Consistent Megabyte+ download speed.

* Bandwidth usage isn't counted in Resnet or any on-campus access point. (All connections remain on campus.)

* Encrypted and undetectable.

* Decentralized, bittorrent-like structure.


**How is it possible?**


We use a program called [RetroShare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroshare) which uses a PGP 'web-of-trust' model. You only ever directly connect to your friends, and no one else on the network can see your IP Address. (Though they may still communicate with you.)

You can anonymously (Or non-anonymously.) publish files for others to download. As long as there is at least one person in the web who has a copy of the file, you can download it (At very high speeds I might add.) even if you are not directly connected to them.

**Why are you doing this?**


A bit of history...

Up until about a year ago this campus had a file-sharing community that used a protocol called [Direct Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Connect_%28file_sharing%29). In fact, the Direct Connect community was one of the reasons I elected to transfer here. I wanted to connect to the main Direct Connect Hub, but when I messaged the administrator I got this reply:

&gt; Hey I'm sorry man but IT has blocked our access and we are trying to get it online but it's pretty grim

What the **FUCK?!** How am I supposed to download those Java ebooks now?!

[OH SHIT SON!](http://i.imgur.com/I4Zyh.png)

Pretty isn't it? Almost like Limewire except it doesn't suck. This new system is encrypted and decentralized, there is absolutely no way of bringing it down.

**Some other pics**

[Talking to people via pseudo-mail and IM. (All still anonymous.)](http://i.imgur.com/GeZ6V.png)

[Forums (Anonymous and signed variants.)](http://i.imgur.com/KeKN7.png)

[Searching for a collection of files.](http://i.imgur.com/U5DNm.png)

[Downloading a file someone has allowed their friends to view.](http://i.imgur.com/xg1Dk.png)

[Consistent high speed downloads.](http://i.imgur.com/mAmy9.png)

*With certain files like .AVI's you can set the download to “stream” and begin watching them as they download like Netflix does.*

**OH GAWD GIVE ME ACCESS!**

I consider this still in a bit of an alpha phase. I am willing to accept a few different friends who meet the following qualifications:

1. Are users who are technically competent and won't be asking me questions every step of the way.

2. Aren't assholes.

3. Willing to immediately take the effort to find someone trustworthy and friend them on the network. (The more friends you have, the faster speed, more access to files, just choose carefully.)

These users can then allow other people to connect to them. Connecting to someone is as simple as downloading [this program](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/downloads.html) and adding someone's public key. They must do the same to you. Be sure to use nopaste.com or something to share your keys, if you just paste them in reddit's messaging the format gets all fucked up.

**IMPROTANT NOTES**


* When first creating an account, do not use your real name or email, changing the location is annoying as hell, so just leave it blank.
* You **must** change your download and upload speeds to 99999, or else your connection will be consistently slow. You can find this in the quick-start wizard once you get the program set up. (It looks like a wand.) I recommend you leave your visibility to ""Public"", don't worry, you will still remain anonymous.
* When you first download from someone, the download speed remains very slow for the first minute or two before jumping up. I don't know why this is the case, but it doesn't seem to affect groups of small files like ebooks.
* Do not just dump your ""torrents"" folder! For gods sake rename the files so we can search for them properly!

~~Again, message me on reddit if you want access. If you want access from someone else or you want to ask a question, comment to this post. If you are already in the network and need help, search for ""General Discussion"" under ""popular forums"".~~

**Due to the VAST amount of people who want access, I've decided to move the requests into our new subreddit.**

http://www.reddit.com/r/shadownet/comments/pufh9/f1rst_p0st_requests_for_access_here/

**Post there if you want access, me or a mod will friend you.**

Expect more updates soon.

As a roommate, I'm fairly relaxed. I like to keep clean, and I'll be pretty focused on my studies this year.  Video games and reddit are my only vices, so there's no danger of parties or other such noise.

1320267491.0,11,self.UTAustin,ly4n1,9 (or so things) YOU JUST DON'T DO IN THE LIBRARY,,24,13,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/ly4n1/9_or_so_things_you_just_dont_do_in_the_library/,"hey guys.  i study in the biblioteca a lot and there are some things that people do in the libraries around campus and more specifically PCL that make my blood boil.

one. the moment you walk into pcl THE REVOLVING DOOR IS NOT A COMPETITION.  SLOW THE FUCK DOWN.

two. THE FUCKING ELEVATOR: need to get to the 1st or 3rd floor? yes. are you handicapped? no. okay so did you just finish a marathon or something? nope. TAKE THE MOTHERFUCKING STAIRS.

three.  floor selection: 

*if you're going to work in a group to study that's totally cool; go to the second floor commons or to the 5th floor.  BUT THIS DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN RUN AROUND LIKE AN ASSHAT AND PLAY MUSIC IT'S A LIBRARY FOR GOD'S SAKE.

*need some quiet time? why don't you go to the 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 6th floor of the PCL or any of the quiet libraries on campus.  BUT IT'S A MF QUIET FLOOR THAT MEANS NO TALKING. NONE. THIS ALSO INCLUDES CELL PHONE USE. walking a little ways into the stacks does not cut it.  i can still hear you.  i'm sorry you have to pack your things and take them with you to somewhere you can talk but that's just how it is.

four. CELL PHONES: in addition to issues with cellular phone communications already mentioned, these should also be kept in mind:

*for some phones, the vibrate setting is almost as loud as the ringer.  you know who you are. put it on silent.

*NO MATTER HOW LOUD YOUR VIBRATE IS, when you put your phone on the desk you're sharing, EVERYONE using the desk can feel EVERY message.

*speakerphone is NEVER OKAY ANYWHERE.

five. food:  food is totally cool in the library as long as you clean up after yourself.  the only problem i have is when your food smells like ROTTEN FERMENTING POOP CORPSES. 

six. share the outlets.  pay it forward.  it might be a little awkward at first, but it's not like you have to talk to the person or anything.  don't feel like sharing?  want some solitude? GO TO YOUR ROOM.

seven. TALKING (CONTINUED): this one in all all caps TALKING ON A QUIET FLOOR IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE DOES NOT MAKE IT OKAY.  EVEN IF I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, IT'S STILL FUCKING ANNOYING.

eight. sleeping: the library, by its nature, occasionally induces slumber.  totally cool with that.  i sleep in the library all the time.  however, i am a quiet sleeper.  if you snore or talk in your sleep DON'T SLEEP ON A QUIET FLOOR JUST GO HOME.  it's sad how many times i've actually had this problem.

nine. headphones: if your music is audible to the people around you through your headphones, why not just go to a FUCKING quiet floor?

10sih. whispering: be aware of how quiet you actually are when whispering  do you really know how to whisper or are you just making more hissing noises than usual?  if completely necessary, and you're a grand champion whisperer and the person you're whispering to has supersonic hearing, do so.  otherwise, write a note. geez.

anyone have anything to add??

**EDIT:** I just want anyone else who might read this to know that while these are things that actually bother me, I'm not this angry about them.  I don't blow up in people's faces over them or even do anything other than ask someone (most politely) to stop, but only when it affects others too.  I believe a lot of people are inconsiderate of others in public and I thought this might be a good forum where I could express this frustration by JOKING ABOUT IT.  I'm not going to stop studying at the PCL.  You can't tell me that something on this list has not bothered you at least once.  Thank you and I'm sorry if this offends you, but I stand by what I've written.  Just know you should take everything with a grain of salt.

Anyway, I was supposed to be subleasing an apartment over the summer with a friend who ended up getting an internship.  I still want the apartment, but don't want to pay for a 2 bedroom by myself.  

It's a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment on the corner of San Jacinto and Dean Keaton (across the street from the CPE/ETC and across the intersection from the RLM).  We'll be playing $900 + utilities for the whole unit (split down the middle - 450 + half of utilities for each of us), so it's a ridiculously good deal IMO.  I believe we're each getting a parking space, too, if you have a car.

About me:  I'm 4th year CS major (graduating May 2012) originally from Houston.  I have a job and am planning on taking 8 hours of classes over the summer, so I'll probably be gone a lot of the time, but otherwise, I play a lot of videogames (xbox and pc: I don't mind setting everything up in my room if that's a problem)...  Actually, I'm terrible with about me's, but I think I'm a pretty easy-to-live-with / easygoing person... if there's anything specific you'd like to know feel free to ask.

I'm planning on buying most of the common-area things (dishes, silverware, couch, tables, etc), so you shouldn't need to worry about anything but possibly a bed (I may be able to get you a twin to use over the summer if you don't want to invest money in one right now) and anything else you think you'll need. 

If you're interested (or just want more details), post or PM me.  I should be able to arrange a tour or something before you need to agree to anything, so there's no pressure to make a decision before then.  

Thanks, and sorry again for advertising on this subreddit :D

As part of the house meetings every night, we would read out ""Kudos"". I searched around the net to see if there was a clear description of this activity, but to no avail, so I will try to explain it here:
&gt;Kudos describes a community activity based on words of encouragement, achievement, or gratitude. For example: ""kpsfire, thank you for holding the door open as I was struggling with my library books, I really appreciated that."" Or ""Lady in the red dress, your impromptu slam poetry recitation in the Honors Quad was really impressive."" Or even ""Professor X, I have never fully grasped the power of matrices until I took your class. Thank you.""

&gt;These kudos, at least at EPGY, were written on scraps of paper and dropped into a cardboard box, and then read out and the end of the week during a house meeting. Compliments are pretty awesome to receive no matter what the occasion, but it was especially nice to see how many people would nod along or even applaud after a particularly sentimental or gracious kudo (not sure about the plurality of ""kudo/s"", but I'm sticking with this).

I'd like to, if possible, reproduce something similar at UTAustin. I think a trial could be run within one of the dorms, and based on reception to that pilot program I could scale up. Here are my thoughts:

* Start with a wooden box placed in a well-trafficked location, like the front desk of Carothers.
* Provide scraps of paper and a few pens, and instructions on the front of the box.
* Encourage thoughtful, appreciative entries rather than hastily scribbled and shallow ones.
* Related to the above, ask submitters to keep anonymous creeper ""appreciation"" posts on LikeALittle.
* Ask for the name/identity of the submitter, but do not require it.
* On the web end (described below), allow people to ""like"", respond, and comment on submissions.

I'm planning to collect the kudos at the end of every week, moderate them (i.e. throw out flames and off-topic entries) and put them up on the web. At first I might start with WordPress or Tumblr for simplicity and cost-effectiveness (free) and the link to the page would be featured prominently on the box. If there's enough of a response I can purchase *utkudos.com* for ten bucks a year and migrate whichever service I'm using.

Thoughts down the line:

* Facebook integration might help people from submitting annoying responses to entries posted online.
* No commercialization. Ever.
* I may have to jump through some official UT Policy hurdles (i.e. bend over and take it a few times to get this accepted) but I'm willing to put in the effort to read these aloud outside or post them physically somewhere.

I may be asking for help soon, but at the moment I'd just like your thoughts: comments and suggestions. Do you want this?

I am a recent transfer student to UT (this spring was my first semester here - I am from Seattle and haven't met too any people yet), and am looking for a new place to move into at the end of the summer. Being social definitely is important; from what I've heard I don't think the greek scene is really for me, but I've spent the last 6 months living on my own so I'd like some middle ground. Co-ops sound like a great place to meet new people and a cheap alternative to student housing, but I'm wondering what type of reputation they have? I would imagine they definitely vary from house to house, but am curious as to how the general atmosphere is around the co-ops. Or maybe someone has input on a specific house?

It was the closing days of the Civil Rights era, and administrators were so afraid of a liberal uprising that they built buldings around campus (like the CMA and other Communications landmakrs) that were designed to stop objects from being thrown in through the windows, like molotov cocktails. This was also a time when students were cutting themselves, to put their blood on the Tower to put it all in perspective.

Some students still wanted to meet in private, and this gave birth to the ""Eyes of Texas"", an association of faculty and student leaders  dedicated to maintaining a cohesive student power on campus. They were responsible for helping Dove candidates maintain their positions on the Daily Texan editorial board when ROTC kids wanted the board to reflect the views of the pro-Vietnam war politic.

Over time this group has consolidated to oversee most of the influential positions in Senate, Student government and other organizations on campus. From publications to students interests, when the ""Eyes of Texas"" find someone they like, they invite them to a private meeting and induct them. So it goes, the current president and VP of Student gov are new members. They also maintain a large and sizable alumni network.

Anyone hear about this organization? Thoughts?",,False,self,t5_2qy08,False,,,True,t3_xccem,http://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/xccem/the_eyes_of_texas_an_active_secret_society_ut/,

Psych and Neurobio major with a Chem minor who lives over in the 28th/Rio area. I'm taking summer classes and am pretty much just psyched to be at UT and want to take advantage of all the awesome things the university has to offer.

So far I know that:

* I can use Greg for free w/ my ID. 
* Cap Metro and UT Shuttle are free w/ ID.
* The undergraduate writing center offers free help on essays.
* There are something like 13 libraries, which is pretty spectacular. 
* I get 10% off at Amy's.
* There are TONS of research opportunities. Once I'm done with my first semester of summer classes, I'm going to look into getting into research in the fall.

What else? Any great discounts, cool free opportunities, or awesome spots on campus that I should know about?

[edit] I know about ratemyprof and myedu, which I already use to check before registering for classes. I also have a great excel sheet detailing all the classes I need to take with pretty colors and the like, so no worries on that front either. I've met with both my advisers (and my psych adviser twice), so I'm making sure I know what I need to do to graduate. 

Also, is there an updated place to show flair? The thread linked on the sidebar has been deleted.

My fiancé recently got accepted to a grad program at UT Austin and is heading up there in the fall. I am probably going to be going with him as well. We are originally from Hawaii, which as you can imagine is a bit far away. He's visited once and lived elsewhere in Texas for a couple of years as a kid (dunno where exactly) but I've never been anywhere near Texas and have no idea what to expect.

So just looking for some pointers. We are already beginning to look into housing possibilities - but since I'm unfamiliar with the area, are there any places to look at or avoid? Been trolling craigslist a bit and it looks like there are some very reasonably-priced apartments nearby campus, but otherwise no idea.

Also generally interested in what to expect, what the city is like, what student life is like, etc. I expect a bit of a culture shock moving to the mainland anyway, but it doesn't hurt to be prepared!

Anyways just thought I'd make an initial shoutout and see if anyone had anything to tell us :)

If you're wondering about the experience,  our volunteers have gone on to make production companies like Roosterteeth, win tv shows on OWN (Zach Anner), write for Dreamworks, win film festivals, and more.  Our news volunteers get quick success, often getting a tv news job right after or even before graduating.  We have numerous sports volunteers working for Longhorn Network and ESPN in Bristol too.

Our alumni have consistently said working here has given them a huge edge over other RTF or journalism students in the real world.  So we're definitely a big resource for anyone looking to boost their resume and get a head start on his or her career, and also a cool place to hang out and meet great friends, as cheesy as it sounds.

This Thursday at 8 pm in FAC 21, we're having our general meeting.  If you're interested in working on any of our shows, in front of the camera or behind the scenes, come to the meeting.  You'll get to see what each show is about and get to sign up to work on them.  Even though I mentioned RTF and Journalism, all majors are accepted.  We hope to see you there, and we can answer any questions you may have here.

I am slightly worried, so I am thinking of back up plans.



I plan on applying 1st choice as ChemE and 2nd choice as Mechanical Engineering, and then transferring later. Would this be recommended? Or, should I apply for Chemistry in College of Natural Sciences as my second choice?

Also, this is assuming that certain engineering degrees are more competitive than others? (Am I right about this?)
