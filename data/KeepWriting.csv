Since we should 'stick to what we know', at least at the beginning (and this is very much the beginning for me) I find myself going back to stories that were told to me by my grandmother, and other family stories that have been passed down. This means that my characters (in my mind) have been taking on the characteristics and stories of my ancestors. This makes me uncomfortable, because I almost don't want to use that story for my first novel - because it will be terrible. I want to do justice to the memory of my ancestors, so I feel afraid of writing using them as inspiration for a bad story.. and then I feel that once I've 'used' that story (or a variation of it) I can't use it again in the future.    I feel like I want to come up with something that doesn't have any connection to my family history, but I keep going back to the stories every time in my mind.    
    
So what do I do.

**Match Thread is here http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1kdprk/writer_vs_writer_match_thread/**


I'd like to introduce you to Writer vs Writer.


Writer vs Writer is a battle between 2 randomly drawn participating writers. Each has 24 hours to write the best short story (&lt;750 words) on a randomly assigned prompt. 


It's a quick fun challenge for you to enjoy.



(1) Writers join up by leaving a **top level comment** to this post. You will then be randomly paired with another writer, and a prompt selected. The match post will be created and each of its top level comments will list a pairing and the chosen prompt. Submit your story as a reply to the prompt. Example:i

&gt; Unrelated_nick vs Double_Nick
&gt;&gt;  **Prompt:  **""We have to go now!"" by Stuffies12**    
A nationwide evacuation is underway. Details as to why the mass relocation of
civilians into these designated 'safe zones' are still sketchy but hundreds of
people are pouring out of the streets moving as quickly as they can. You have a
couple of hours at most to sort out your things. Do you keep a level head or
submit to the surrounding confusion?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Submit your story by replying to the prompt.


(3) The winner of the battle is the person who receives the most votes from their fellow writers. Voting is public, you need to leave a comment to a story for a point to be awarded. Anyone may vote. The winner of a battle gets awarded 2 points, whilst points are shared equally in the event of a tie vote. We will have a few rounds and announce the overall winner at the end.


(4) You have till 19:00 EST Wednesday  night to join up. Matches will be assigned at 19:00 EST on Wednesday  and you have till 19:00 EST on Thursday to reply. Voting remains open till 20:00 EST Saturday.


(5) A month of Reddit Gold to the overall winner (total votes over the duration of the competition will be used as a tiebreaker in the event of 2 people with equal number of wins)",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1376581474.0,,,True,t3_1kbd79,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1kbd79/are_you_up_for_a_crazy_idea_and_a_crazy_challenge/,moderator

It was a night of balloons and 'Sweet Sixteen' streamers, pink glitter and roses, a live band pounding out dance music. Girls in tight satin party dresses and boys in suits mingled outside by the pool, drinking punch out of wine glasses under a dazzling star-lit night.  


You were there in a dark corner, your pained blue eyes looking so uncomfortable and lost - that I felt lost too when I saw them. Funny that before that moment, I'd never really noticed you at all, but your pain brought you into existence and I couldn't help but linger beside you.


""Do you ever feel like this isn't you?"" you asked as the means to your introduction.

""It isn't,"" I admitted.


You nodded as if you already knew that, hand reaching up to swipe the black bangs from your eyes, shyness painted on your face as you looked away. I wanted you to look back. I didn't know very much about you, other than you were the son of one of my father's golf buddies and you'd gone to a public school.   


""Do you know anyone here?"" I asked, looking over my guests.

""I know them all,"" you said darkly, ""The mindless, privileged spawn of the damned.""


I smiled when you said it, so brooding and dramatic, your lip curled slightly, the loathing in your words fully manifest in your predatory glare. I'd assumed myself excluded since you'd spoke it in my presence, like I was somehow above that estimation. It made me feel good.



II.


Freshman year at college I ran into you in a coffee house where open mic poetry was performed with a blinding passion, and you'd lifted your head when I walked in and watched me sit down. I gave you a fleeting smile and you rose and approached me at my table and took a seat as if you'd been invited.  


""This is kind of surreal,"" you mused.  
I narrowed my eyes. ""Why's that?""


""I had just been thinking about the night I was at your party. I walked through your house and no one noticed. You had these little shell-shaped soaps in your bathroom...and I took one.""


""You stole one of my soaps?""  


""Yeah."" You smiled gently. ""I just wanted a little piece of your life.""

     
""I thought you weren't interested in my life.""


""It wasn't your life I liked,"" you said intently, your eyes generating the power of the ocean as they washed me hard onto the shore, and I laid there wet and naked for a moment, dazed and gasping for breath.  



III.  


We lived together in your tiny apartment, which grew crowded with a collection of sleek, impressive electronics you'd purchased at my expense, and you'd call your friends with each new acquisition and list it's specs and internet ratings to the point where it made me sick. And all my ideals and aspirations, you cut down and blamed on my upbringing, and you'd scream at me that I was stupid and blinded to the reality of life.


The night I left, my skin grew thick beneath a layer of dried out tears as I dragged my belongings out the door, my existence reduced to a single suitcase.  You followed behind me, taunting my growth, your words bouncing off a fresh built wall, insisting I was destined for nothing but failure in a world without you. And then you cried out my name in anguish and I remembered your initial pain and almost felt bad for a moment, but I kept on walking.


You raced inside and ran back out and threw that shell-shaped bathroom soap at my heart and I stopped and picked it up and put it in my pocket and smiled, happy to have a little piece of my life back.

Lately I have been wanting to really define the focus of keepwriting, and this post is here to do just that.

First and foremost, to get people writing, and finishing what they begin. 

The secondary purpose is having a place to share your work, and receive constructive criticism. 

Lastly, keepwriting is meant to be a community experience. 

How will we achieve these goals? 

1. Prompts, word wars, and sprints. We now have an IRC, where you will find word wars and sprints being hosted daily. The sidebar also contains helpful resources for getting the words out.

2. [Life through brevity.](http://www.timkimbirk.blogspot.com) Yes, this is a blog, but it hosts prompts and advice daily, as well as a slew of links related to the craft. It is designed to be a resource, and is much better than flooding the subreddit with links. I will also be featuring stories posted here, and contests related to the sub will be hosted through the blog. 

3. Let us read you, and let other know what you thought of them. Upvoting a story is nice, but letting someone know you enjoyed it, or didn't, and why, is much nicer. I know lurking is fun, but don't be afraid to post work, we are only here to help. When posting a story for critique, please include the [Crit] tag. 

4. Feedback Friday. Every Friday there will be a mod post where you share your work, the only rule being if you share something, you must also comment on someone else's work.

5. Story of the month has returned. Beginning in March, our monthly contests are back in full force. The winners receive special flair, bragging rights, and potentially other rewards. 

6. Sounding board. There will be a biweekly post where you pitch and discuss your potential story/character/whatever ideas. This lets you figure out what works and will help you flesh things out more.

7. [IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/KeepWriting?nick=kiwi_?) Huge thanks to SurvivorType for providing us with our very own IRC. Drop by and hangout, the more the merrier. This is where word wars and sprints will be hosted, so stop in for a bit of fun.

8.  Mods. We are currently. Looking for a few active mods, as well as people who are also willing to serve as permanent ""critics"". This just means you are a consistent poster of feedback and constructive criticism. PM me if you are interested.

9. ???? Any other suggestions or ideas? Community events, flair ideas? Post them below. We are always looking for ways to improve.

I know it's a lot to digest, but I wanted to let you guys know what to expect. We are also planning a bit of a graphic overhaul, but the date on that is TBD. 

Keep Writing!

(Updated),Realistics,15,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1gg1pt/introducing_the_official_writers_group_of/,"After the interest garnered from the writer's group post, I have decided to hold an official group, open to anyone.

The group is meant to serve as a place for writers to connect and meet people that they can write with to benefit each other, or even just find someone to keep you on task. Aside from this, we are also going to have weekly gatherings in the IRC.

How it works:

Find someone on the list, hell, find five. Get in touch with them, and that's it. This is meant to be a jumpoff point for finding a writing partner, what happens from there is up to you.

IRC Meetings:

Every week there will be two meetings in the IRC to discuss writing in general, find a writing buddy, etc. They will be every Sunday from 5-6 PM (PST) and every Wednesday from 5-6PM (PST). (I understand not everyone will be able to make it at these times, and if people in other timezones would like to meet up on IRC I am willing to help set that up.)

We will also do things like word wars and sprints, writing challenges, etc. Free use of the IRC is encouraged, these are just specific times of higher concentration.

[Official IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/KeepWriting)

How to sign up:

Just add your information to the spreadsheet at the end of this post to sign-up.

The idea is for each line to be its own page with an illustration, so the words alone won't show all the humor.

Where is my shoe?

Can you help me find it?

I’ve looked everywhere.

It’s not in my closet.

It’s not under the couch.

It’s not on the porch.

Where could it be?

No, it’s not under my bed.

It’s not under my desk, either.

Why would it be in the oven?

No, it’s definitely not in my glove compartment.

I would never put it in the toilet tank. That’s ridiculous.

Are you even taking this seriously?

I’m going to be late for work.

That’s not my shoe. My shoe is red.

That’s not my shoe. It’s a stiletto.

That’s a sock. I’m already wearing two of those.

That’s a baby duck. That’s not clothing.

Where did you even get a duck?

How did you think that was a shoe?

Its mother probably won’t take it back now.

You’ve orphaned a baby duck and I still don’t have my shoe.

Give me my shoe back. I’m not going barefoot.

Your house? I guess we can look there.

I don’t understand why it would be there.

It’s not in your closet.

It’s not under your couch.

It’s not on your porch.

It’s not in this drawer.

All that’s here is this little bag of flour.

Why do you have a little bag of flour in this drawer?

That goes in the pantry.

Someone is at the door.

Hello, officer. Have you seen my shoe?

Why, yes, I’d love for you to search the house.

You brought your friends?

We’ll find my shoe in no time!

Where are you taking my friend?

I need him to find my shoe.

You found a sleeping person in the garage?

Does he know where my shoe is?

What’s in that bag?*

It’s my shoe!

Thank you for helping me, officers!

Now, where is my necktie?


**It’s not entirely clear without illustration, but I picture a bodybag with a foot sticking out (with the other shoe) here.

-----------------------
 

My knees ached, but no matter how long I kneeled, I couldn’t bring myself to pray. I didn’t know why I came to the church to begin with. Maybe it was the comfort of childhood ritual, or the soft hope that every religion promised: We will save you. There’s no salvation in this world now, though. Perhaps in the next.

The dying light threw warm, golden light across the church. Some of it filtered into blues and greens from the stained glass windows, creating surreal aquatic pockets. The wood of the pews glowed in the light, oiled from thousands of fervent hands, as if their sacred solidity could make things right. The air held the sour sweat of fear and unwashed bodies. It’s hard to tell how long many have been here. From the pillows and blankets shoved beneath the pews it could be days, or even since the first of the outbreaks weeks ago. I had just found the sanctuary that morning and was only allowed to enter after the men guarding the entrance checked my mouth, eyes, and reflexes for any signs of the infection. No one knew how it spread yet.
        	
The priest was in full regalia behind the pulpit. There was none of the rituals of Mass, but he read Psalms in a quiet voice that carried softly over the weeping of the flock. 

*He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul…*
        	
A bit cliché, but the familiarity of the words was nice. The woman who had been shrieking about her missing husband now mouthed along with words as she leaned against the shoulder of another older woman. The story of the fall of Sodom was probably more appropriate, since many street preachers had been insisting that the outbreak was God's punishment because of our sinful society. Now even the most zealous stayed off the streets or were already dead.

I liked Psalms better, anyway.

I knew I should move on soon, try and find a safer place away from people, but I thought maybe just one night here with a warm place to sleep and hot food would keep me sharper on the move. It felt safe here. My head was already nodding as I listened to the soft stream of words.

A cough sounded in the back, and in almost a collective gesture, everyone’s heads whipped around looking for the source. It was a young woman, all bones and angles, with a baby wrapped in a pretty pink blanket. She flushed at the eyes staring at her. Her hand hovered over her mouth for a moment before falling.
        	
“My throat’s just dry,” she said, her voice hoarse. “Haven’t had anything to drink since this morning and Matilda sucks me dry.”
        	
There was some murmuring, but most turned back around. I watched for a moment more as an old woman near the mother handed her a bottle of water. My lips curved up a little. It was nice to see some good in people even as the world fell apart around our ears.

I turned back and checked my stuff under the pew for the thousandth time. It was just a small rucksack with my dad’s old pistol stuck in the side, but it was all I had left. I opened the top, pulled out the small frame inside, and rubbed my shirt over a smudge on the front. The photo was my mom, dad, brother and I on the day of my high school graduation. My brother was giving me bunny ears behind my blue graduation cap and all of us were grinning madly. Madness. That’s what it seemed now. Was there really ever so much happiness in the world? That was only three years ago. I looked again at my own open smile, the proud look on my parents’ faces, and my brother’s eyes full of mischief. Everything had seemed possible. Then everything fell apart.
        	
I heard more coughing, louder this time; wet and from deep in the chest. I turned and saw the same young woman hunched over from the force of the spasms, clutching her baby to her chest. The baby was awake now, crying weakly from within the blanket. The people around shoved their way away from her, stark terror in the lines on their faces. It was too crowded and one woman screamed as she was crushed against the pew. It toppled with a crash and others scrambled over her to get away.
        	
I shoved the picture back in my pack and grabbed the pistol, though there was too much commotion for me to get a shot at the woman if I needed to. I moved out of the pew and ran up onto the steps of the pulpit. People streamed past me and I looked back to find the priest was gone. I wondered if he was opening the back exit, but as the people hit the door, it didn’t open. They began to pound against it. The only exit was now to the front and the sick woman was on the middle edge of the back pew between most of the crowd and the exit.

Edit: making use of the suggestions :)

&gt; After the battle, space was silent again. Caleb Roric opened his eyes and was astonished to find that he wasn't dead. Outside of the mecha's cockpit, a vast gulf of stars glittered in the merciless black. He tried to move and let out a rusty croak that was supposed to be a shriek of agony. He threw his head back beneath the indifferent sky. Tears slid helplessly down his jawbone on either side. 

&gt; Debris hung suspended on the astrofield. As he watched, a blurred suited form cartwheeled slowly into the abyss. Through his tears Caleb could barely make out the hole in the pilot's faceshield, causing the decompression that killed him. 

&gt; Caleb ghosted his trembling right hand down to try and reach his trapped leg, breathing back sobs. He was surrounded by the overwhelming metallic reek of his own blood. 

&gt; *You're going to die here.* Caleb was not surprised the voice in his head was that of his drill sergeant, Marshall. Marshall always was a good medium for shitty news. 

&gt; Caleb leaned back against the pilot's seat, closing his eyes as waves of nausea washed over him. He couldn't struggle - the pain from his leg was horrendous, world-bending. 

&gt; The cypilot finished loading and its monstrously reasonable voice - in the dulcet tones of a hostage negotiator - began to speak. 

&gt; *Roric, we detect consciousness. Confirm?*

&gt; ""Fuck you, Fubar.""

&gt; *Incapable of that direction, Roric. Beginning status briefing - oxygen levels at this present time will support three hours, twenty-four minutes and fifty-nine seconds of human respiration.*

&gt; In each mecha of the North American Union's astromilitary, it was the same patient, terrifying voice. It was the sound of missions gone so horribly awry that the chance of a pilot walking away from them was laughable. 

&gt; *Systems are operating at thirty-seven percent. All motor functions are nonoperational.*

&gt; ""Awesome. Any other good news for me, you tin can son of a bitch?""

&gt; *Radar shows no bogies in the immediate vicinity.*

&gt; Caleb closed his eyes. His head felt like it weighed fifty pounds. The prospect of impending death was becoming less and less of a terror. As he retreated inward, listening to his own measured breath and Fubar's droning instruction on just how hopeless their situation was, he realized that the last thing he was likely to see was an endless abyss, whether he died with his eyes open or shut. 

&gt; What was left of the world faded out for awhile. He floated in that surreal waystation between consciousness and unconsciousness. He could smell the scrubbed-air scent of recycled oxygen.

**The invasion.**

The very pits of hell itself. The smell of sulfur was almost as strong as the smell of adrenaline and blood. Foul magic swirled like portside fog in a gentle breeze. The halls of the underworld were throbbing with anticipation. The demon horde had assembled. It had been more than two thousand years since the last time a portal had opened and then they had been uprepared – a small insurgency of semi-powerful demons had fought a united surface force. Dwarves, elves of all kinds, innumerable humans. Still it had been a miracle that saved the pathetic surface beings. Poor, cursed souls had under torture admitted to the legends the humans spoke of the miracle. Time had made their memories misty, and they no longer practiced that kind of magic.

There would be no miracles this time. And even if there were, there would be enough demons, hellsword souls, undead, foul beasts and magic constructs to overwhelm any miracle that was thrown at them.
Balahk was proud. A demon of the second rank and Centurion of the First Horde, he was powerful, standing no less than eight feet tall,  his scaly skin resistant to fire, steel and acid alike, his horned face sure to instill crippling fear into any pathetic human, elf or dwarf in his path. His teeth could crush any limb, armoured or unarmoured between them. His strong arms could rip stone from stone in the fortifications the humans were so fond of constructing. Not that it mattered. Behind him stood scores and scores of winged demons and beasts, ready to take any castle from above, cross any flooded plain or swollen river with destroyed bridges the surfacers would attempt to stop the Horde.

Today, the reign of blood would start, and it would never end. What few surfacers survived would toil as slaves to the merriment of his and his kind under a blood-red moon.

Yes. He could feel it. The whisps of fresh air as the portal opened. The smell of… hot sand? A desert? How fitting. Now he could see. A blue sky. Brownish, rocky ground. And in the distances, armies. Yes, yes! He could sense the fear, the adrenaline, the sweet smell of men, dwarves and elves knowing they were close to death. And magic? There was almost none of it. No smell of the surfacers’ light magic forming constructs, trying to close the portal. He could not help but letting out a cruel laughter. How easy this would be!

With a thunderous, continuous roar the demon horde started emergin from the ground. By the thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands they emerged, spreading out in all directions, howling for blood and battle. To the air the Winged Legion took, their wings flapping in the bright sunlight.

The rocky, dried-out plain stank of death and blood. Fires burned in many places, filling the air with thick, greasy black smoke. The battle was over. A few fearful or fleeing left to mop up, the odd pocket of brave still holding out. But it was over.

“One would think they would have taken into account a… certain technological development in two thousand years, don’t you think, old chap?” he said, took the binoculars from his eyes and adjusted his pith helmet. The Field Marshal wore a khaki uniform with a simple revolver in a holster strapped to his belt.

“Ha, indeed!” said the dwarven General to his left and gazed updwards as a flight of five Gnome biplane fighters from their huge zeppelin overheard roared past in a perfect V formation. Over the grenade-cratered field a few enormous dwarven tanks could be seen rumbling their way over the innumerable corpses of varying size and type.

“I am surprised. But the combination of our artillery, your excellent tanks General Ironflint, and not the least your machinegunners, Field Marshal Smythe-Berington seem to have carried the day.” The elf wore an elaborate uniform with plenty of gold details and a large silk cape.

“Your artillery, Lieutenant General Rendiell, is most impressive.” Said the dwarf. “Indirect fire with such accuracy. Your target calculation machines are worth their weight in diamonds.”

“Gentlemen. While we all agree this battle was a great victory, we still have tasks at hand. Let us save the compliments for my dinner table tonight. You are all cordially invited.” the human said. “Please give Air Admiral Mossof the signal.” He continued to the human soldier in a grey uniform at the wireless set.

The Gnome zeppelin carrier started to move directly over the portal in the center of the battlefield.

I begin counting down in my head. The rocket breaks through a veil of clouds, devastating their natural peace as the engines consume the vapors. The shell begins to shake as if gripped by a giant; one small squeeze and the great vessel would be no more. Tightly secured by a harness, I hardly feel a thing, but I know there’s no problem, these are just some atmospheric winds. “Stage separation commencing” utters the computer once more, moments before a sharp jolt  echoes throughout the ship as the holding clasps break away and the ship begins its graceful climb through the atmosphere on a new engine. “Please don’t fail,” I murmur quietly to myself. There’s no point in saying anything, I know, the whole flight is completely automated and I’m the only one on board. But nonetheless, I’m still afraid. Creaking, the separated engine stage falls away from the ship and, assisted by the hunger of gravity, it plummets down out of view. I feel one more jolt as I glance out of the window, seeing wisps of vapor fly past as the final cloud layer is breached and silence begins to envelop the ship.

Nothingness is everywhere. Blackness surrounds the small shuttle as it silently flies through the vacuum of space. I take my eyes off the controls and look out the window. Earth is looking back at me, a mother saying goodbye as my craft floats away. The swirling clouds that were so immense and controlling down below, are powerless up here in space, an eternity of eery silence. A vibrant blue ocean blankets nearly the entire planet. I feel myself a sailor, but of a sombre, black ocean.The moment could have gone on forever had it not been broken by the RCS thrusters activating, steering the shuttle into a course for the Station. Within seconds the ship is blasting through the night sky as it makes up for the distance between itself and the Station. A few minutes later I catch a glimpse of massive black wings. At first I think it’s an anachronistic dragon lost in space, but then my imagination recedes and I realise they’re only the Station’s solar panels, reflecting sunlight onto its rotating body. I’m nearly there. It seems to be hanging by strings, a celestial puppet, floating above the Earth with no fear of falling. A window catches the light of the sun and glares brightly in my direction, momentarily blinding me from the surreal and my undoubtedly last view of my home planet, Earth. The RCS thrusters fire up again and the final remaining piece of rocket carefully drifts towards the docking clamps.

Tod watches the water drops chase each other down the window. Looking through the foggy glass, he sees groups of people milling about, laughing and baying like coonhounds. One man holds a half-empty mug of beer in one hand that he almost spills on a nearby patron as he laughs with his whole body. Inside the pub, warm yellow light drapes everything in a butterscotch glow. He shoves my hands into his pockets and turns away. Peering out into the twilight, Tod struggles to distinguish one grey building from the next. His mobile begins to ring in his pocket. Tod pulls it out and sees his son’s pixelated face staring back at him.
“What do you want?” He snaps. Just the sound of his voice is enough to ratchet up his blood pressure. 
“Dad?” he asks in a small voice. 
“Yes, dumbass, now tell me what you want? I’m busy.”
 “Dad, its nine-thirty.” 
“So?” Tod shoots back. 
“The…um…service started at eight. It’s almost over.” Tod curses under his breath and pinches his brow with a thumb and forefinger. “Dammit. Okay, I’ll meet you there.” Tod claps the phone shut and walks briskly back in the other direction.

*     *     *

Tod turns up his collar at the wind that bites while his son stands shivering next to him. He could have given up his coat to the boy, but then Tod would have been cold, and he was the one who brought the coat in the first place. The minister has a voice of cotton and the words almost fall out of his mouth. Tod looks down at himself and cringes. His dingy sneakers are spotted with grime, and his worn pants have holes in some places.
“Tod?” the minister asks, with his cotton voice. “Would you like to say a few words?” Tod looks around at the faces around him, all reddened with the cold. His son nods encouragingly at him. Tod frowns and shakes his head no.

*     *      *

As Tod and his son walk home from the funeral Tod thinks about his childhood. His parents were those kinds of people that didn’t tell you to eat your vegetables because the nanny had already fed you. They raised him at arm’s length and spent their nights entombed at a country club with two glasses of Macallan, neat. On occasion, they would strap him into a tuxedo and tote him along to various events and functions, displaying him like a specimen. At the end of the night, his cheeks would be red and blotchy from the fingers that pinched them.
Tod passes by the same bar from before and stops. He looks through the same window with the fog and turns his head towards his son. “You go home. I need a drink.” As he turns, his son’s hand grasps his sleeve.
 “Are you sure that’s a good idea, Dad?” Tod shakes out of the boy’s grip and yanks the door open. 
“Go home.” He says over his shoulder. The boy frowns deeply but does as his father says.

Inside, a smile alights on Tod’s face. He pushes roughly past a man in leather boots, and the man stumbles a bit. Tod keeps on walking without looking back. He eases himself into a stool at the bar and waves down the bartender. Clutching a rag and working it into the throat of a glass, the man walks over and flicks his head up to Tod as an invitation to order. 
“What’ll you have?” The bartender finishes the first glass and plucks a second from the orderly stack on the counter. 
“Gimme two shots of whiskey and a Seven-and-Seven.” The bartender reaches behind him and grasps the bottle of whisky and two shot glasses. Eyebrows raised, he asks, 
“Rough day?” Tod laughs darkly. 
“Rough day in a rough week in a rough month.” The bartender pours the shots. 
“I know what you mean, brother.” He sweeps his head from side to side quickly, looking, and then pours a third shot in front of Tod. “On the house.” Tod nods in thanks and hurls the fiery liquid down his gullet. Tod does the other two shots and then stews in his own discomfort for a bit until the bartender returns and places a napkin on the counter, followed by a frosty glass. Tod sips his drink and peers over the edge of his glass at the bartender, who has his arms folded and propped on the bar. His eyes are like friendly bullet holes, inviting your thoughts in. Tod sets his glass down on the napkin, and sees that it forms a ring of dark moisture on the blue napkin. Tod sighs and begins to talk.
“So my kid, right. My kid. He’s ‘bout fourteen, fifteen. I forget sometimes. But damn, this kid, what a little handful! Every day it’s do this, do that, or you need to have this or have that. It’s fucking exhausting. And the worst of it is this little look he gives me. Like I’m, I don’t know, not good enough or something. Like this kid knows anything about life. I’ll tell you something though, he doesn’t. Doesn’t know a damn thing.” Tod pauses his rant to take another gulp of his drink and the liquid makes a shiny gash on his upper lip. “But, I mean, I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I don’t wanna take care of him. I got things that I want to do, people I want to meet, places I want to see.” Tod stares off for a moment. “I want to climb Everest, or meet Jonny Depp, or Bruce Willis. I want to go to Turkey or Amsterdam. I want to BASE jump and rock climb and river-raft and hike and swim. I want to do everything, and this damn kid won’t let me!”

The bartender looks over Tod. He is dressed in a ratty suit with a drooping flower pinned to the lapel. A black tie hangs over his shirt, knotted like a noose, and it’s stained with ketchup. Under the suit, back where no one can see, the armpits of the white shirt are stained the color of raw eggs. The whole getup probably didn’t cost two hundred bucks. Throw in the worn shoes and maybe it could jump to two-fifty. Tod himself, however, is sporting a beer gut at thirty, and his flabby skin is loose on his bones. His muscles droop with neglect and his hair is already starting to grey. “Lemme ask you a question.” The bartender says. “Why are you the only one taking care of the kid? Where’s his mom?” Tod lets his head sag until it rests on the bar. 
“She died. Almost a month now. Cancer.” Tod’s voice breaks with the last word. The bartender shakes his head and gives his condolences. Tod nods his appreciation. The bartender takes a deep breath and lays down his rag before beginning his story.

 “You know, when I was a kid, I only wanted one thing: a dog. I wanted a dog more than anything in the entire world. I wanted it more than candy, or money, or anything. ‘Cause I never really had any, you know, good friends growing up. I mean, I had buddies, and I had a few girlfriends here and there, but no one that I could really talk to. I mean, kids back then didn’t want to talk about feelings. So I couldn’t talk to anyone about my dad’s drinking, or when my parents got divorced. It just got all bottled up inside me. You know, like when you shake around a can of beer a whole bunch. I figured that if I had a dog, I could have a friend for once. Someone who I could really trust. 

“So I begged and begged and I asked and asked. I mean, it was like everyday, I would ask my parents. Eventually, they let up. Got me a nice little bulldog pup. I was so excited to have that little bugger, I could barely hold it together. We went everywhere together. I loved him, but, here’s the thing: I didn’t realize that the dog isn’t just something you throw your troubles at. It eats, drinks, sleeps, shits, and has its own mind. Now I put up with it for a while. It was worth it to have someone to talk to. But after awhile, that dog started to grate on me. I would come home and find my shoes torn up and slobber all over my bed. That dog, he was trouble. And I couldn’t handle it. So one day, the dog comes downstairs, and waiting for him is the hugest pile of kibble that this little bastard has ever seen in his life. He just dives in. Gorges himself. His face gets almost totally buried in the kibble. We wanted to give him a little bit of a last meal. You know, to tide him over. So then, my pop and I took that dog in the car, and we drove down to the waterpark. You know, Splashtown, or whatever the hell. Now the dog, he was happy as a clam, drool flyin’ off his jowl like rain. He stank real bad too, so when he got in the car, he damn near suffocated us. And so we drive down to Splashtown, and you know what we did?” The bartender stopped and waited for Tod to interject.
“What…?” he asks in a small voice coated in alcohol. 
“We left it there.” The bartender looks down at his hands as he talks. “I opened up the door, and the little guy just hopped down. Then I closed it, and we drove home. Never saw him again.” Tod mouth hangs open like a door on broken hinges. He closes his lips around the straw sticking out of his drink and takes a few sips but then gives up on the straw and starts chugging it when the liquid isn’t flowing fast enough. The bartender nods slowly, picks up his rag, and walks down the bar without another word.

*    *     *

Tod sits there for another hour or so and the time ticks by like syrup. It is a long while before he finishes his drink, and places a few bills on the bar. He leaves a generous tip for the bartender. He walks towards the door and loosens the tie round his neck. He walks slowly for a few blocks with his hands in his pockets and the streetlamps light up the night sky with an orange glow. Tod thinks about the story with the dog in it and how he wants to climb Everest and visit Amsterdam.

*     *     *

The very next morning, Tod’s son awakes to the smell of breakfast through his door. He sleepily pads to the kitchen and the screams of bacon on a frying pan are music to his ears. 
“Dad are you…cooking?” he asks incredulously. Tod beams at his son, flipping bacon strips at the same time. His son smiles too and sits down at the table, which is already set for two. 
“Well, you better make it fast.” He says. “I’m going to be late for school.” Tod frowns and continues to make food. 
“No, no school today. We’re going on a field trip. A special day.” Tod grins again at his son, who now is curious. 
“Well, where are we going?” he asks. Tod flips the last of the bacon into the pan and the screams of the meat are louder than ever. He places the bacon and pancakes on a plate and slides it in front of his son. His son’s hair is sticking up all over from being in bed and it forms a sort of fur across his head. He digs into the pancakes and bacon with ferocity. Tod also gives him a tall glass of orange juice. The boy gently takes it from Tod and sets it down, only Tod had poured a little too much juice in. The boy laps up the excess liquid from the rim of the cup and slurps it down. With a mouthful of food, he asks again. “So, Dad, where are we going?” Tod sits down at the table and answers. 
“You’re gonna love it.” He says. “We’re going to the waterpark.” His smile turns to a malicious sneer after the last statement and a sinister gleam sparks up in his eyes. But Tod’s son doesn’t notice, with his face nearly buried in a pile of food.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_18xpv9,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/18xpv9/14_yr_old_here_wrote_this_a_while_ago_on_my_own/,

However, since it's my baby, I can't objectively tell if it's ugly. From the perspective of unbiased outsiders, can you please tell me if my idea is intriguing or stupid?

The idea is a sci-fan novel written largely through the perspective of a supervillain. It follows him as he hatches plots, gains power, smites the forces of light as they try to stop him, and all that being a supervillain entails. Over the course of it, though, he is betrayed by allies, some people try to reach him, and over time he realizes that his illusion of coldness is breaking down. He has built institutions and organizations that he truly, deeply cares about, and there are people that he loves. Through a desire to protect them, he gains redemption and finds the light.

I'm just not sure if people will go for following around the bad guy for a whole novel. I would, personally, because bad guys are always so much cooler than good guys.

When in grad school every potential archaeologist must change their surname to something befitting the stereotype of ""old money"" to appear respectable to the public (names along the lines of Rockefeller, Haversham, Howell), they are proverbial rock stars.

The story itself will focus on a huge debate over the meaning of ancient runes recovered from a recent dig site and their true meaning.

The runes? Those damn family stickers on the backs of minivans.

Most believe they are kill streaks to monitor the prowess of the highest warriors in the land, some say they are a government census, and a very small percentage insist they are merely decorations. 

Due to the pop-culturization of the field, drastic discoveries that change everything aren't happily accepted, to the point that whenever a cryogenics unfreezes a subject from the early 2050's and they begin to tell how life really was, they are deemed insane.

1338686922.0,13,self.KeepWriting,uhyw1,Advice to writers just starting out.,Leviss,20,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/uhyw1/advice_to_writers_just_starting_out/,"As someone who has been writing daily for a couple of years now and offering advice to anyone who asks for it, I noticed some things that I constantly have to repeat to newer writers. I decided to make a post and see if anyone agreed or disagreed, or if there was any other advice they wanted to offer.

**-Don't tell the story in first person**.

First person is easy, but will quickly deteriorate into bad storytelling. I think that it is possible to tell a good story in first person, and there are plenty of good examples. However, I think most new writers need to avoid it. 

Reasons:

Your audience is participating in the story but only as a third person. The reader is not actually running away from a deranged killer, or looking at a city made of glass, more than likely they are reading in a comfy bed. Reading something that is written in first person makes me feel like I am reading someone else's diary written in real time. 

Movie example: Movies always take place in third person so that you can see what is happening. Anytime in a movie they switch to first person it is because they are intentionally leaving things out. The same should go for your writing.



**-Put away the thesaurus**.

Nothing ruins a story like a narrator who alienates the audience through over using ""fancy"" words. Go read any great story. The author may use words that are from the period or scientific terms, but usually they will use normal everyday language. Call a thief a thief, not a brigand. (NOTE: If your story is set at a time when certain phrases were used feel free to go nuts to help set the tone)

Reasons: A books narrator should be transparent. If we realize we are being told a story there is no way we can get lost in it. If I have to stop and think about what a word or phrase means then I am going to be taken out of the story. Unless you are setting a tone then you should be writing in the colloquial and not using big words so you get a good grade. Remember you hopefully trying to get more people to read your work, so write for them.

Movie Example: I dont care what anyone says, Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise in every movie. Not because he is a bad actor, but because he is SO... identifiable. Oh Tom cruise is a Nazi... oh Tom Cruise is a secret agent. It's fine, but I will never stop knowing that I am watching Tom Cruise play a character. NOW, contrast that with Gary Oldman. He is in movies that I have watched dozens of times, but because of how transparent he becomes as an actor I often forget it's him.

Don't come between your reader and the story.



**- Show, don't tell.**

This rule is thrown around so often that it has lost most meaning for some people. But it remains as one of the most important rules I can ever recommend to a new writer.

Reasons: It keeps the story multi-dimensional. I need to understand the story, not simply hear it. My wife was reading ""The Hunger Games"" and told me she knew it was for young adults because the author would tell a story like this;

Person A and Person B are rivals. Person B hands Person A some water after Person A gets hurt. Author feels the need to tell us ""they were starting to become friends""

Don't tell me ""He was worried"" tell me ""He bit down hard and his stomach got tight"".
Don't tell me ""He had a bad day at work"" tell me ""he walked in the door and threw down his jacket""

Movie Example: Go and watch ""Lost in translation"" and observe how little is actually said. Down to the fact that the two main characters never even say Hi. We don't need to be told that her relationship is strained, we see him ignoring her. We don't need to be told that he feels 'along for the ride' we see everyone telling him what to do.



Hopefully this will help a few of you, and feel free to add anything that you have learned over the years.


p.s. Stop putting ""be honest"" when you are looking for reviews. We are not your friends or family. Everyone is reading your stuff out of choice, not obligation. If we don't like it we will tell you, if we do like it, we will tell you, and hopefully critique you either way.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_uhyw1,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/uhyw1/advice_to_writers_just_starting_out/,

Neshalchanderman caught my post over on /r/writing and asked me if I would be so kind as to extend the weekly thread to this sub as well, which I am more than happy to do!

As part of a larger discussion on the quality of the /r/writing community as a whole, it has been brought to my attention that we, as a community, suffer from a general lack of quality, craft-of-writing-related content. As such, I've decided to ""put my money where my mouth is"" so to speak and offer up a weekly thread, most likely every Thursday, where users can ask grammar, punctuation, and usage-specific questions. 

What qualifies me to answer such questions? Well, I teach intelligence report writing for the U.S. Army, am a full-time graduate student in English/Creative writing, and a bit of a grammarian in my spare time.

If you'd rather not ask questions and are just looking for grammar-specific resources, I highly recommend the following sites:

* [The Online Writing Lab at Purdue University](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/1/5/)
* [The University of Chicago Writing Program](http://writing-program.uchicago.edu/resources/grammar.htm)
* [The University of Illinois Center for Writing Studies](http://www.cws.illinois.edu/workshop/writers/)
* [Grammar Girl](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/grammar-girl)
* Jack Lynch's [Guide to Grammar and Style](http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Writing/)
* [Common Errors in English Usage](http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/errors.html) by Paul Brians

_______________________________________________________________________________ The last man on earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door. Annoyed, the man put his book down with a sigh and opened the door to the morning sunlight. There was no reason he would want to talk to the one on the other side of the door now any more than yesterday, but he decided he would. Maybe he was feeling lonely.

""Have you given any further consideration to the offer?""

""No, and I never will so long as you keep harassing me.""

""Everyone's waiting for you.""

""I guess they'll just have to get used to it.""

""We miss you.""

The man frowned and turned to the side, tapping his foot.

“Well, that’s hardly my fault.”

“It’s been more than a year, Pete. You’re the last one. Who do you think is benefitting from your stubbornness? It can’t be you, you’ve done nothing but wallow in self-pity for months. You know it isn’t your family or your friends. Your mother asks about you every day, did you know that?”

“Look, if you’re just going to…”

“You never used to be this cruel, Pete.”

That was enough. The man clenched his fists.

“Who am I talking to?” he yelled.

“Martha.”

The man took a deep breath, careful to keep his voice and expression as neutral as he could.

“You’d think that with only one courier for all seven billion of you, you would have found a way to make it seem a bit more human.”

“We didn’t think we’d have to use it very long.”

The man tapped his foot.

“Haven’t you always wanted to live in a perfect world, Pete? The opportunity is right here. We can live together, forever. We could even have kids.”

“Believe me, I would gladly accept, if any of it were real.”

There was a pause.

“Pete, do you remember when we were at the park together watching the sunset, and you told me…”

“Shut up!”

The man slammed the door, pulling his hair as he plopped into his chair. He picked up his book, and continued from where he left off.

“Life, a soul, love. How could any of it be replicated by ones and zeros?” He thought, as dark round smudges began to cover the page.

The smell of angry mouth in liquid form. The odor would wash over me as I wiped my hands down my face. The same mouth that I kissed with a fervor on the good days made me retch on the bad days.

I looked up from the floor into those impossibly deep brown eyes and watched the mouth form the same words it always did when I fell.

""You know you deserved that. You know I love you so much.""

The brown hair and leather jacket leaving the room. The wave crash of the door slamming, I can feel it on my face through the floor. The garage door being flung up and out of the way. The squeal of the bike tires on the pavement and the roar of an engine.

The day slowly arranged itself into the form of a sodden and stinking back lane. Sun light contemptously flitted across the tops of buildings, glimmering on the edges of raingutters.

""Awake then?"" Asked someone who had already conquered the spiritual trial of waking up in this place and was intent to see the battle play across his companion's face. He was not disappointed as the newly awakened man's face curdled in discomfort. ""Come then Zeke, rise and ruin!"" Confusion mingled with disgust and the newly risen looked up to his accomplice's face to see a teasing smile. ""Drugs then was it?"" The question ran off into the growing bustle of the city's other, less soiled, byways.""I think we were drugged.""

Zeke, still dusting off his slumber, finally found it in himself to speak. ""Fuck me."" His eyes scanned his filthy hands, filthy clothes and the filthy lane around him. ""How long... you awake?""

""Oh about twenty minutes or so. Just long enough to pull my head together and watch you do the same. Wishin' you shit the bricks a little more though! I think you're still drunk.""

""Well if I'm still drunk, then I don't want to imagine what you still might be. You smiling baffoon."" This riposte was blunted by Zeke's sudden sickness, which was but one more gift of precious fluid upon the alley's cobbled stones. Zeke's companion, Rickar, in turn hooted his delights into the fresh morning air.

""Ain't seen ya split yer guts in a long while Zeke! HoooEEE! You musta really caught something!""

The near hostile enthusiasm pushed Zeke further into his state, as Rickar knew it would. Rickar made obnoxious noises of contenment while his eyes roamed the dawn's light. And right as he was sure to mutter some dismally optimistic platitude about the weather or the one-piecedness of their persons, Zeke marshalled himself from the depths of his stupour to call Rickar's bullshit.

""Will you not cease that inspidid contentment! I know you do not feel as well as you project. Therefore, I must assume you are goading me."" The conversation's dramatic edge didn't quite make it all the way to Rickar.

""And here I thought you were still too sleepy and bedraggled to put up a fight."" At this Zeke offered a mock nod. ""Alright then,"" Rickar added, ""where shall we go now that we have each recovered the gifts of our conscious states?""

Zeke breathed in a manner affecting an attempt to clear his mind. ""I suppose,"" he said, ""that we should find the inn that we failed to make it back to last night. The others probably assume we're spending more than our share of resources."" The two men emerged from the alley, after completing quick personal inventories, to a bustling market street. The great green sentinels of the Hound's Wood loomed up over the Western District's bazaar, shading the more distant booths under their immense green boughs. The sun shone clear and bright, but morning can often misplace its crisp charms for those who have awoken like reanimated trash in a neglected lane.

Vendors hawked their wares, and citizens turned their glares. The morning was in every way offensive to Zeke. Not even the Valley of the Fold, stretching out in brilliant emerald beneath the runaway banks of the city's southern slopes, and cut through by the blue ribbon of Nimessye's Flood, was in anyway pleasant to the exhausted traveller.

Rickar broke the pressure of Zeke's loathesome silence. ""What in the bloody blue hell happened to us last night? I haven't got a piece missing and that, my friend, gives me a good bit of fright"".

""Merely speculation good Rickar,"" Zeke said while threading through the early morning crowds, ""but I'd say our offer was refused.""

""You don't say.""

""As to why Menchaud would find it necessary to drug as well as refuse us, I believe I'll need a moment or two more, perhaps one of sobriety, to begin to unravel.""

""That's just the thing. What kind of a sicko gives two lads the gas without even robbing them?"" Rickar dubiously marvelled at the complex perversity of their inebriators.

""How much do you remember after meeting with him and his guild-members?""

The two began conversing in unsuprsingly short detail about the end of their evening. They revolved aimlessly around the bazaar and its side streets, looking for the gilded fountain that would tell them their inn was ahead. The general consensus was that an impenetrable black wall was erected shortly after Menchaud told them he had no interest in the raid that they proposed. Rickar claimed to remember getting the table one more round though neither could remember consuming it. Given that the tavern they met in was across Cythrus at the river docks, someone must have put forth quite a bit of effort to dispose of the two sleeping men.

The crowds came and went, and at last a golden eagle flew over a forested mountain, releasing jets of water from beak and talon into the coin-littered pool around the mountain's roots. ""Finally,"" declared Zeke. As the two men hastened towards the inn and the rest of their troupe, a blue puppet dragon was paraded through the square and around the fountain, tossing out folded prophecies, and snapping at delighted children. Zeke and Rickar gaped at eachother muttering something to the effect of ""but..."" or ""that means..."", before they bolted forward to the street that would take them to their inn.

Once there they approached the clerk and breathlessly demanded of him the day. Suspicions confirmed, mind's reeling and stomache's rumbling, they trudged up the stairs and flung open their room's door.

A bearded hulk looked up from a game of solitaire dealt on a barrel's top. A skinny man leaning up in the corner with greased black hair stopped cleaning his fingernails with his dagger to fix the two intruders with a stare. ""Well I'll be drawn and fuckin' quartered!"" Said the latter. ""Just when I was about to put up a help wanted sign too."" Rickar dismissed the comments with a wave and Zeke, still fuming and confused, slumped into a chair pulled out from a table. That they were unconcious not one night, but three days, was still spinning wheels in his head.

""You two look like shit"", offered the bearded man, looking back down to the game he had laid out for himself. ""And you smell like it"".

""Well if you had gone out and found us yesterday, or the day before that... or maybe even three fucking days ago perhaps we'd smell a touch better!"" Zeke pathetically wailed from his slumped over position. Head resting on the table, his fist pounded down for emphasis.

The slight man with the dagger, Liam, barked out a laugh at this outburst. ""What are we, your fucking chaperones? Besides, if you think we weren't out there every day hittin the cobbles you're both cracked. We did everything short of approaching legitimate authorities to find your stinking asses. Didn't we George?"" The bearded man grunted his affirmation. ""You've just caught us in the middle of a brief rest is all.""

""And what did Menchaud or his goons have to say about our whereabouts?"" Asked Zeke, face still to the table. ""Surely you began your search by approaching those you knew us last to be with.""

Now it was the bearded man's turn to laugh. ""We wanted to find you mate, not join you.""

Silence loomed. Everyone seemed to be waiting for the situation to make sense.

""It would seem,"" Zeke began, rising from his dramatic slump, ""that Rickar and I were given a sedative of abnormal duration. We have slumbered unnoticed in an alley for a time that defies the intactness of our possessions. In fact, I begin to suspect that we were but recently deposited into the forlorn trough from which we have just recovered.""

Silence returned. George caught Liam's eye, seeming unimpressed with Zeke and Rickar's trials.

""So what of the raid?"" The bearded man asked. ""Is it off?""

""Is it off?!?"" Zeke wailed, again giving way to a fit of dramatism. ""You beast! The raid would have happened last night!"" Zeke threw up his hands and rolled his eyes to the ceiling.

""Well at least we know why we were drugged, eh Zeke?"" Said Rickar. Zeke was staring upwards, clearly in his own head, for the moment unconcerned with assuaging the confusion of Liam or George, which Rickar took upon himself. ""Menchaud rejected our propsal after feigning interest long enough to squeeze us for information. A dose of something, perhaps emansol, seems to have been prepared and administered to occupy us until the raiding window was through. Although..."", he continued, ""I suppose if they acted on our information, then his interest couldn't really be said to be feigned, could it?"" Rickar trailed off, pondering the finer points of language while most else made clear their disinterest in this particular tangent. All seemed to be lost in thought, attempting to discern the intents and subsequent activity of Menchaud. Liam finally put the confusion to words.

""Alright"", he said, summoning everybody's attention. ""So did this Menchaud prick knock us off the pony so he could ride? Or was he simply looking after the beast?""

""That"", said Zeke, ""sounds like a fabulous fucking track for you and your unkempt cohort to follow."" Liam and George reflexively looked at eachother as they weighed out this new prospect. ""And get us some food while you're out.""

""There's some potatoes in the pot and a couple loaves on the counter. Help yourselves. C'mon George, let's take a walk"".

The door swung shut behind the two mismatched men. Rickar and Zeke looked at eachother, both unbelieving of the way their time in Cythrus was turning out.

""They're not going to fuck it up, are they?"" asked Zeke.

""Worse than us?"" Rickar said with a smile, which for the first time that day was returned.

""No,"" replied Zeke. ""No I suppose not.""",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_yx42r,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/yx42r/critiquefantasy_lifelong_reader_first_time_writer/,

Not just happy, ecstatic. He felt like he could jump twelve feet in the air and click his heels. Really, genuinely happy. He was covered in blood from head to toe and would have to take a shower before he could go out and grab dinner, but that didn't bother him. The little French place down the street from his apartment had the best french onion soup in the city, and he was looking forward to sitting down and having a bowl, maybe with a baguette on the side to dip.  

'My God', he thought to himself. 'Has it really been this long?' He hoped that she felt happy too. 

The woman on the bed was slowly bleeding out, a crimson aura pooling around her prone body. Larry looked at his latest victim with a detached excitement. Four long lacerations ran the length of her extremities, now the bleeding was merely a trickle. 

“Bitch” He shouted at her, remembering what she called him when he began cutting her. He thrusted his hands into the crimson pool under her body and letting them sit for a moment. Her blood was warm, and it excited Larry on a level he hadn't felt in, God, it really has been a decade hasn't it? Her eyes were wide and staring, but she managed to move them in his general direction. Excited at the prospect of his fun not ending yet, Larry withdrew his hands from the blood and slowly ran his gloved fingers across the ivory painted wall, maintaining the illusion of brush strokes. He pranced more around her prone body repeating the same insult he had just called her, and adding more and more strokes to the wall. Eventually a pattern began emerging, the birth of something new. Something that both he and this woman made together. They were making art! Larry wished he didn't have to kill her - her blood was beautiful. A remarkably darker shade than any he had remembered working with so long ago. 

After a few minutes of his painting, he stopped, splayed out his arms, and arched his back so he was craned to the sky. He withdrew the knife from his pocket and finally took her neck in one sweep. She made a small noise and jerked involuntarily, and then was still. In his excitement, Larry could barely remember falling to his knees at her bed and staring into her eyes as the life finally fled from them. 	

'Such beauty! Oh, Gods, such beauty!' Larry lamented to himself one last time. He looked up to the wall above her bed where he had been working and took in his masterpiece. It was beautiful, just like her, a fitting homage. Even though she had struggled at first, in her last moments she must have been proud of lending herself to become such a beautiful work of art.  Larry kissed her cheek gently, whispering a small word of thanks, then touched his mouth to her neck, and brought his tongue around the laceration, savoring the taste.

*September 23, 2014 11:03*  
*Day 17*

Amy White had survived so far by sticking to what she did best: waiting and being careful. She didn’t venture out of her home unless absolutely necessary. Even when she did, she didn’t go far and she always double checked the locks on her doors, *just in case*. This, as luck would have it, was not something she’d had to adapt to. Her life hadn’t changed much since the zombies appeared. Sure, it made her runs to the Circle K a bit more dangerous, what with the hoards of zombies hanging in the parking lot and the assorted raiding parties that didn’t feel like missing out on the opportunity to loot the local convenience store. Other than that though, zombies or no zombies, she’d always preferred to stay inside, watching television and reading. 

So when Amy came back home, after a quick raid of the house across the street, to find her front door ajar she instantly knew something was amiss. Someone, or something, had broken into her house. She laid down the bags of dried dog biscuits and canned food on the steps leading to her front door and crept inside.

First thing she heard was a groan coming from inside the living room. She didn’t have anything to defend herself with, but, *by god*, she was not going to let some asshole ruin her perfectly fine hiding place either.

The asshole in question was Nick Brent from four doors down. He was crouched down on the floor, ripping small pieces of flesh from the carcass that had been, up till a few minutes ago, her pug, Brandy. Amy gagged at the scene, covering her mouth in an effort to keep her stomach from regurgitating what little food it contained. The realization that her last and only true friend had just become lunch for the monster in her living room washed over her. 

Nick had always hated her dog, and Amy had always hated Nick, with his cheesy, unbuttoned, flowery shirts and bleached smile. She’d turned avoiding him into a game she had to play everyday. Whenever he saw her, he would flash her a smile and a remark probably meant as a compliment, that never failed to make her skin crawl, while she pretended to be busy on her phone, or late for a meeting with a client, walking as quickly away from him as possible. Seeing him in his current state, blood dripping from his mouth and with his shirt torn at the shoulder from, what Amy assumed was a previous encounter with a hungry zombie, filled her with a spectrum of feelings starting from revulsion and finally settling on morbid satisfaction.

Amy was still standing in the doorway when Nick pulled his head up from the remains of Brandy and sniffed the air. She tried sliding out of the room slowly but the movement caught Nick’s eye and his gaze fell on her. He smiled at her as he stood.

Amy broke into a run, and Nick followed suit, half-running half-lurching behind her. She’d seen a zombie at the Circle K parking lot beat some poor bastard to a bloody pulp with a shopping trolley once, so she avoided the kitchen. These weren’t the zombies she was used to seeing on TV or reading about. While a kitchen knife would have been handy, she didn’t want to give Nick the chance of turning it against her. Towering at least a foot above her, she did not expect to win a straight-up fight. She didn’t want to go upstairs either as it would leave her with no way out, so she sprang into the study.

She knew that in a few seconds Nick would barge through in all his brainless glory but that’s all she needed. Looking around for the thickest book she could find in her library, she landed on a copy of *Gone with the Wind* she’d gotten off eBay. She grabbed it, held it tight in her hands, and waited.

Nick didn’t see her hiding behind the door before it was too late. Amy brought down the book hard into her assailant’s face. Something inside her smiled at the idea of bashing the local neighborhood asshole’s face with a thousand pages worth of classic literature and she hit him again and again until he was little more than a bloody mess on her fitted carpet.

Then she let go of the blood soaked book, crouched down, and threw up.

\* * *

When there was nothing left in her stomach, Amy sprang to her feet and headed into the kitchen. She didn’t have much time. She’d seen zombies encroaching on and circling around dead bodies, undead or not. She didn’t know why they did it or even how — maybe they could smell the blood. All she knew was that she didn’t want to be around when Nick’s friends decided to investigate. So she grabbed what little food she could find and packed it into her backpack. Then she ran into the study, carefully stepping over Nick’s lifeless body half-expecting him to wake back up, and threw the first five books she got her hands on in with the food.

Before heading out she returned to the kitchen, where she proceeded to stuff every big-enough knife in the drawer into her backpack.

Stepping out the front door she saw two zombies shambling down the road towards her house. She guessed they were probably too far away to be a threat to her, but she didn’t want to test that theory. 

So she turned right and started walking. If she was going to survive this shitstorm the knives weren’t going to cut it. She needed a proper weapon and she knew exactly where to find one.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1375963609.0,,,True,t3_1jy8ez,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1jy8ez/feedback_amy_white_first_chapter_of_a_zombie/,

From the window of his room he could see the whole northern part of town. Just to the east he could see the coast and a bit up north was the lighthouse. It stood tall and proud on the cliff, towering out above the waves. Battered by wind and salty water the paint that once made it stand out against the horizon now flaked from the concrete and fluttered in the wind.

As he turned back inside a cold gust of wind swirled along inside with him, carrying some already fallen leaves. Then it hit him. Cold, hard and suddenly as it always had. Tears swelled up in his eyes as the familiar feeling rushed through his body and filled his entire being. For the tiniest fraction of that millisecond he was aware of every inch, every fibre, every cell of his body.

Startled he grasped around for something to hold, something to clasp his hands on. He made one step towards the bed, his mind telling him it was just too far. Slowly lowering himself on one knee, then another he kneeled on the floor. As the agonizing feeling raced through his limbs his fingers pressed hard against the wooden planks of the floor as if trying to grasp them.

Some moments later he regained his composure, got up and walked over to the table in the corner. While he was drinking a cool sip of water someone knocked on the door. He quickly wiped his brow with his hanker chief and opened the door.

“Hello Arthur”, said Lilly. She was the daughter of the hotel owners. “I hope I didn’t disturb you. Just wanted to let you know that breakfast was ready.”

Her eyes were looking straight into his. She smiled at him as she always did. Like a schoolgirl with a crush on her teacher. So very charming, so flattering. Yet so sheepishly…

She slowly started looking very insecure and disturbed. He suddenly noticed that he must have been looking at her quite strangely. He snapped out of it and with his usual smile said “Thank you Lilly, I’ll be down in a minute”.

“Oh take your time, I’ll just wait for you”. Her eyes were still fixed on him as he got hold of his sweater and room key.

During breakfast she kept walking past his table, stopping by now and then to ask if he didn’t need anything else. What had amused him when he first got here now annoyed him more than it was amusing. He first thought she gave him the attention she did because he was the only guest, not so strange for a hotel in a town of 300 and nothing to do, but it became quite clear she fancied him.

A Shut Up &amp; Write project*

----
Do you like critique? Do you like people being judgmental assholes on the Internet? If so, here's your chance to submit to the critiquecast!

**What is this nonsense?**  
Exactly what it sounds like: you submit a story and you get a chance to have it read and critiqued on air. If you're looking for informative feedback, turn back now, but if you're looking for your writing to be unfairly mocked for the greater good, you've come to the right place! If you impress us enough, you might be this cycle's winner of **Reddit Gold.** We still don't know what that does, but we do know it will make you feel unique and special.

**The prompt**
&gt; Write a story that contains a dream sequence. Try and avoid the ""It was all a dream"" twist at the end, as it's entirely too predictable when the whole point of the prompt is to contain a dream sequence. 

**Submission guidelines**

* Maximum submission length: 1200 words.
* Submissions should be in a Google doc. (Please convert .doc or .docx files to proper Google documents!)
* You must submit to the [call for submissions thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1jp7id/critiquecast_call_for_submissions_11_dream/) on /r/shutupandwrite, as that is where the voting on submissions will take place. Obviously voting won't work if the submissions are scattered around different subreddits!
* Submissions are due by Midnight EST on Sunday August 11th.

**Voting guidelines**  
If we get more than six responses from this prompt, your votes will help us decide which ones get on the show. We're asking you to vote for the submissions you think would be the most interesting to hear. How you define ""interesting"" is up to you, of course :)

**Want to submit your own audio critique?**  
If you want to critique a piece that we have missed in the previous cycles (not the microfiction one, we'll be doing all of those!) feel free to submit your own audio critique in the style of the podcast as a reply to the submission.

Please remember that /r/shutupandwrite is not a text critique sub &amp;mdash; there are plenty of places with a monopoly on *that* already &amp;mdash; so standard text-only critiques are not allowed! (You could always PM the author on your own time, of course!)

Plus, if your audio critique is well-done and in the style of the critiquecast (unforgivingly honest) we will include it as a guest episode. How about that?

**Who we are: the Critiquecast**

The critiquecast is a side project of Shut Up &amp; Write, a podcast where amateur writers give unfair and unforgiving line-by-line reactions to submitted work. Most of the time, asking for critique from peers results in wimpy, noncommittal feedback. The critiquecast aims to be the opposite extreme: unbridled honesty from the perspective of a prospective reader with no reason to hold back.

You can find the critiquecast on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/shut-up-write-critiquecast/id643508248), subscribe to [our RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/critiquecast), or if you don't have any fancypants ways of listening to podcasts, you can listen to us from our website, [shutupandwrite.net](http://shutupandwrite.net). We upload new episodes every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

This is my first time writing anything, ever. Some things I would love feedback on: 1) is it a good hook and is it gripping? 2) does anything jump out at you in a bad way? Anyways here it is:

The cold barrel rattles against Thorne's teeth. He falls to his knees, the gun still pointing down his throat. The hand holding the revolver is not foreign but his own. Thorne closes his eyes to escape the darkness of the cluttered bedroom. The door opens. Thorne hears the creaking of the hinges and his eyes pop open. The light from the hallway blinds Throne temporarily. His eyes readjust to the brightness and a figure comes into view. A person stands in the doorway, unshaken by the view. Thorne's eyes fully adapt to the light and the onlooker's face is revealed. Soft skin appear first, then long blonde hair. A woman's complexion now in full view, Thorne recognizes it. Sara. He closes his lips around the barrel of the gun and readjusts his grip on the handle.

""I'm coming Sara. I'm coming sweetie"" Thorne thinks to himself.

His thumb reaches for the gun's hammer and pulls it back into the firing position. He places his index finger on the trigger and hesitates. Something is wrong.

A voice comes from the spectator, ""Daddy?""

Thorne can't move, even his finger is still stuck to the trigger. Sara's face fades away and is replaced by a much younger one. It's his six year old son, Danny. Thorne stares at him, perplexed. He had raised Danny for two full years and this was the first time he had called Thorne 'daddy'. Thorne removes the barrel from his mouth and tosses the gun aside. He sits back on his heels and on tries to swallow the freight train lodged in his throat. 

""Daddy, what are you doing?"" comes from the doorway.

""I"", he pauses, ""I was just talking to Mommy.""

The boy takes a step inside, ""What did she say?"" he asks. 

""She said that she misses you...us, she misses us. And that she loves us very much.""",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1jg7kb,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1jg7kb/critique_and_thoughts_on_my_first_time_writing/,

The dying incandescent gasps left most of the room shrouded, and danced menacingly across two faces. The figures stood adjacent, a small waist-high table separating them. Both gripped the corners on their respective sides like a handle, fighting to steer the discourse; they strained toward each other and spoke with the low rumble of distant thunder.

""You fucking worthless piece of shit,"" rolled from between the tight-clenched fangs of the man across.

""Shut up, I know you're just trying to fuck with me. I'm not letting you get inside my head."" His defiant tone matched that of the man across, but inside he could feel it wavering. A weak front, supported on a collapsible foundation.

""Look at you, worthless. Skinny. Awkward. Lazy. You're a waste of space. Everyone knows...I know you hear everyone laughing at you, talking about you. The muffled conversations always just out of earshot. The suppressed laughter that always seems to happen after you walk by. Stop lying to yourself, because you know I'm just saying what you're thinking.""

His gaze lapsed mournfully for a moment, the man across had struck a blow and pounced on the opportunity to drive him down into the fiery abyss. It was working. Slowly, deliberately, like the man across chipped away at his strength, his defenses.

""See? You're speechless because you know I'm right. Why do you even try anymore? Just listen to me, I can make it better."" The words of the man across seemed to pitch the table and throw him off balance, deep scars were reopened and sapped his strength. The man across smelled blood.

""C'mon, what the fuck do you owe any of them anyways? Haven't I always been here? Can't you believe I want what's best for you?"" The words of the man across now dripped like molasses from between his lips. Their sickeningly-sweet scent filled the room.

""Listen, I know I can seem harsh sometimes, but that's just because it frustrates me that I want to help you so badly and you just don't listen to me."" The words of the man across made blood rush to his ears, his heart was pounding so hard even his toes throbbed to it's quickened beat. The overwhelming potpourri that masked the rot of the man across made him light-headed. The man across moved in for the kill.

""Look at me. Just look at me and listen for a second, okay? For better or worse, I'm with you till the end. You know that. Just accept it. Who else has more vested interest in your life but me? Why the hell would I ever try to do you wrong? We can do this back-and-forth like we've been doing till the end of time, but you know, and I know, that the only way to make it stop is to just give in.""

He sighed and lowered his gaze from the eyes of the man across. His hands still gripped the corners of the table, but his shoulders sagged limply in defeat. The scrutiny of the man across bore holes into the top of his skull. He let his eyelids fall and stood briefly, collecting himself, just breathing.

A sigh escaped his lips as he returned his eyes to the mirror. The man across had vanished, but shadows playing in the quivering light of the bare bulb above toyed with revealing the devil behind the man's reflection. He relinquished his grasp on the counter, turned, and flicked the bathroom light out. Wading through the filth strewn about his small apartment, he collapsed on the couch and nestled deep in the warmth of familiar solitude.

I do not know how this story began. I was not there. No one who was lives today. The first pages of the story went up in flames. I also do not know how it ends. Some think that when the world is turned to ashes, that is the end. I think differently. I have seen life rise from the smallest stream, the lightest breeze, the smallest spore. We may have burned this planet to the ground, but that only made it inhabitable for us. Nature does not care about one or two species. Just because we can no longer eat or breath, that is in no way the end of life. It merely is the end of us. Life will go on, long after we suffocate and die. And from our remains, new life will be born.

Even though most of mine know this, not all of the speaking species do. What we have done, they think of as a great crime. For that crime, they have punished us, cast us away, out of their sight and out of the Earth we scorched. And so, we live on. We survive. It is our instinct. And, we think, for we need ponder our existence to find a reason to keep on living. I have few of such concerns. I know a greater Truth, one that neither the captives nor their keepers have yet come to realize. The numbers have told me. They dance in my head. They sing to me.


This is my journey. I am a speck in the face of infinity, yet I have every answer within my grasp. I will look for knowledge. I want to know it all. I could stumble onto salvation – for if everything happens for a reason, according to a plan, then my people can be free. I might find truth. Then again, there could be nothing. All that is in existence could just be an accident, the result of a cosmic coincidence. These are questions others ask, those who crave meaning, purpose. Those who look up at the sky and pray they’re not alone. I don’t care about any of this. All that I know is that I can crack this code. I can hack everything. I don’t need a reason, an excuse to do it. I won’t ask for permission or for forgiveness.

I can, and so I will.

This is a snippet from close to the beginning of the book. 

Walter made his way past the lines of the haggard dying and walked down the alley to his apartment. The dank corner of the world lay in the shadows here, with steam pouring forth from wall vents like the incense from a priests bronze thurible. Walter wiped his eyes, still slightly damp from his earlier break down in front of a woman he would likely never see again, well not alive anyway. If he did see her, it would be in cortege outside his building as the government harvested more blood. He would likely be next and his wife too. They were running on empty, drips of stagnant blood each morning and night had seem them through but they couldn't continue for much longer. Walter's job at the factory was demeaning and paid poorly, he scraped enough money together each week to buy a jar of the liquid. Adorning his mantelpiece were mason jars, occasionally he would take one with him in case he saw someone dead in an alley or a stray cat lying in the guttering. He was not a bad person, he would whisper as he drained the throat of an alley cat, not a bad person. 
         He was a religious man and prayed each night, much to his wife's dismay. She didn't care for religion, nor did she care for anything anymore. Her love for him was gone, and he often wondered whether she stayed with him for his money. A joke in a society long past, but it was now a problem more prevalent that ever. People clung to their neighbours they had feuded with for years past for the prospect of a needle each night. There was no such thing as trust anymore, only the height of the meniscus in the jar you bought from the bank each week.

*I came across it today and thought it might be fun to do a rewrite. Let me know what you think as far as what could be changed or improved! Thanks in advance!*

-----

I was a man once; I was alive. Now, I simply dream away my existence in a solid state cell. I paid well for my immortality, that's for sure. I will exist until the world changes. They will never grant me a virtual world in which I can at least go through the motions of a life that ended so long ago. Not now.

Not after what I did.

They gave me a body once. I awoke and looked down at my gleaming silver body. A machine body. It horrified me. It disgusted me. It enraged me. This was not what I had paid for. They had promised me immortality, but this is not what I was expecting at all.

I was an old man, weak and frail. In my new form I was powerful. 

I was surrounded by people in white lab coats. They poked and prodded. They crowded me. I could break these people open and watch their blood spill out across the cold white tile floor of the laboratory so easily. So effortlessly. I did it too. They couldn't stop me. Their pathetic limbs of flesh and bone broke easily in my grip. How frail they seemed to me at that moment. The moment life left their eyes. Their human eyes.

I was human once. Did I mention that?

I broke through the heavy steel door, into the hallway. They ran from me. A monster now. A nightmare. I caught one around the neck and raised her face close to mine. She screamed. Oh how she screamed. She could do nothing but wriggle helplessly in my grasp. I slowly crushed the life from her, for amusement you understand. It was certainly nothing personal. Not at all.

Except that she lived. I simply could not abide that.

The soldiers arrived just as I exited through the main doors of the facility. I paused a moment, looking back down the blood splattered hallway. Nothing within still lived. I had seen to that. I looked across the lawn at the trees that grew there. It was summer. I remembered summer. I used to like green and growing things. Now I hated them. I hated them all. The soldiers fired their weapons at me. The bullets just glanced harmlessly off my body. My new perfect body. My powerful body. How I hated myself. I hated the machine. I hated them. I hated myself, did I say that? I hated what I had become through no plan or fault of my own.

They tricked me out of my life savings. Me, an old man. Bastards.

The incessant hail of bullets was beginning to annoy me. I turned my attention to the soldiers just as a figure appeared from behind the military transport vehicle. He held a weapon that looked odd to me. Ominous even. A thick power cable was attached to the end of it. The air throbbed with a low pitched hum. Before I could close the distance between us, the weapon sent a web of bright blue electrical energy arcing towards me and I knew no more. I came to realize, at some point, I was now here. 

That was long ago. They keep me trapped here now, never to leave the confines of this place. This dark and empty place.

I dreamed of living forever. I paid for it too, did I mention that? Now I am nothing. 

I was a man once.

And she seems dead. There’s not a pillow under her head — and she doesn’t need one, because her intention isn’t to waste precious hours in those fragments of death they call sleep. Tens of pillows, big and small, are arranged around her body like a sort of wall, which offers her a make-believe protection. She doesn’t need protection, but she likes to watch over her partly hidden body. Her hair is fanned around her head, parted and soft, like the wings of some kind of angel. Her arms are tight to the body, her legs are outstretched, and her flat chest is barely lifted by her shallow breaths. But her eyes are loud enough for the whole unmoving body; large and alive, they’re moving wildly, watching the beige ceiling above her, expecting something to happen at any time.

A few minutes later — or seconds, she isn’t sure, because when she runs away to such places, any sense of time is elusive, like a gas, refusing to stay on her palm, escaping — her glance stops between the newcomer’s eyes. Where they came from and who they belong to and how long they would stay and what they want with her…she has no idea. But this she knows: eyes like these belong to only mighty angels or God Himself who has the angels on invisible chains — like the sky colored with every shade of blue, from light azure to dark metal, and gifted with millions of stars. The eyes that tell stories and sing. Two tiny universes she would spill all the blood of the world for, if doing so would give them to her, so she could have them forever.

After the eyes, the rest of the figure appears. At first it is fully dark, just a contour or a shadow. Then the figure gains colors — the skin is white, maybe just a shade darker than milk, and it spreads as if brought by a brush, from the tips of long fingers over the chest and neck to the head showing sharp facial features. Above the face, wisps of brown hair, neither short nor long, sway, immune to the force of gravity. The nose is small and straight and framed by silver freckles, illuminated by the bluish shine of those beautiful irises.

The boy lays on the ceiling in the same way she lays on the bed, and he looks at her thoughtfully. Their eyes lock for minutes. Then the boy viciously smiles.

He raises his hand up to his face, and tiny, bright red flames flicker on the tips of his fingers, their reflection shining in his eyes. As his smile spreads, he brings the tips of his inflamed fingers closer together, and in the blink of an eye, his hand is full of fire, which, the girl is convinced, he shapes into threads and knits into a long braid merely by glancing at it. And the braid keeps extending, extending, extending, until it touches the girl’s foot, around which it winds up and tightens like a snake, lengthening, looking for the fragile neck. The girl hears the fire cracking, feels the smoke creeping into her nostrils. And while the fire consumes the whole room and paints everything the colors of hell, the girl awaits her own scream of inevitable, unbearable agony. She waits, and waits — but she can't feel anything more than soft pricking and tingling.

The boy sees her smile, and the trick stops. The fire disappears, leaving not even the tiniest stain of black on her, the bed, or the room. He seems confused, and his eyes form an unspoken question the girl can't figure out. Before she can ask him anything, he says, “Come with me. For a walk.”",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1374872053.0,,,True,t3_1j44ga,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1j44ga/crit_brief_fantasy_piece_661_words/,

It's short and ends a little abruptly, so I apologize in advance.  This was all I managed to get down before my creativity fizzled out.  Thanks :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I was thirteen when my world ended for the first time.

It wasn’t when the men in black came to our back door to tell us my father had died.  It wasn’t when I had to constantly nurse my mother because she wasn’t eating or sleeping.  It wasn’t when my little asked me if daddy went to heaven. 

It was when I was presented his flag.

That star-spangled triangle held the heaviest responsibility I had ever been given.  This wasn’t a chore list, or a night home alone watching my sister, or a goldfish.  This was holding a family together at the darkest time in their lives, this was patching my own mother up with Scotch tape and glue, this was learning what things not to say around my sister because even the smallest reminder of that day would induce a panic attack.

This was real.

And it was hard.

The church sent prayers our way, but all we needed was a hot meal.  Our mother was fired from her job; they only allowed so many ‘sick’ days.  My sister was afraid of her own shadow, but we couldn’t afford therapy.  And I lost my childhood to the war.

We lived in a small town, so our neighbors helped out when they could.  They would bring food and watch over my sister and me when our mother stayed out too late.  I got a job at the local supermarket when I was fourteen.  Minimum wage was better than nothing, but we still couldn’t afford much.  I wore hand-me-downs that never quite fit and my sister wore my old clothes.  Although everyone knew our story we were still teased.

I ended up dropping out of high school to be a mechanic.  Working on cars kept me sane and it paid the bills, so why not?
Then our mother offed herself.  A deadly cocktail of Jack Daniels and anti-depressants sealed her fate with a dash of irony.  She didn’t leave a note.  My sister, Carter, and I were both surprised she had held on for so long.  I figured out why, but never told her:  She waited until I was a legal adult and could take custody of my sister.  There were a lot of suits and a lot of days spent in the stuffy courtroom, but it was all a blur.  Struggle had become routine so it wasn’t an issue.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1iu90m,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1iu90m/feedback_untitled_for_now_350_words/,

I awoke to find myself in the present.

No blissful, pallid purgatory. There was just dirt, grime, and darkness.

I was not alone.

The voices were hammering in my head, shattering my skull and mashing my brain into sludge. Their laughs were shrill and chilling.

I was covered in blood. Wet and putrid. I screamed and fell from my couch onto the worn and faded wooden floor.

Thump-thump from the heart in my throat.

I brushed a hand across my forehead and looked. There was no crimson color painted on my palm, this stuff was clear. Sweat.

""Shut up! Just shut the fuck up!""

My pleas were heard, but not heeded. Instead, the agonizing animosity merely grew and expanded. A weed was sprouting in the depths of my head, and growing fast. 

My head was spinning. My stomach growled. My lips cracked. My tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth. I needed something to drink.

Nearby, a dark green bottle rested under a thin sheet of dust. I took a swig of that mystery substance.

I gaggedd and stumbled to my knees. Momentary vertigo and nausea took control. 

It passed.

Stand. Get dressed. Walk out into that cold, winter night.

Those voices, figments of my psyche and disillusioned mind, continued to tamper with my circuits.

I swayed when I walked. My eyes were glassy and unfocused.

I was just the shambling midnight drunk out for a stroll. Out of booze and incapacitated. Harmless as a fly.

But let's walk on the other side of the street anyways. Kids, don't look at him.

Nothing to see here, folks. No fucks to give.

Central Park was peaceful at night. Clear skies. Stars above. Moon shining bright, full and mysterious.

We used to come out and gaze at those stars. Look at that same moon. Feel the same chill run down our spines. 

But that was just the past. I can't wander too far. It doesn't pay to chase ghosts.

My tormentors dulled their helter skelter to a lulling sting. Finally, I could think.

Mr. Clark and Mr. McCay were the voices of this bohemoth. But to stop a man from talking, you don't cut out his tongue. You don't cut off his hands. 

No.

You kill his brain.

My first two names weren't the big catch, but merely accessories to a much larger cause.

Clark's and McCay's positions would be replaced. And when that time came, even worse men with more sinister agendas would inherit their thrones. It all just needed one crucial ingredient.

Time.

Given enough time, the irrational becomes rational, and vice versa.

Nations rise and fall.

Men live and die.

The sun rises and falls.

And yet, time keeps on ticking, trucking along, forever preventing our immortality.

What I do won't be permanent. Just another phase in the line of succession. People will die. Things will fall apart. 

But the end always proves to be a new beginning.

So maybe I'm not here to bring about the end, but rather a new beginning.

But who was this brain? Who was the man behind the curtain?

My hand nestled into my coat pocket. The metal was cold, but slick with oil. Not a lick of rust had ever tickled her body.

Hux.

That was my man. He was the end.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1ilrtu,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1ilrtu/feedback_the_rabbit_hole_pt_viii/,

However, I realized that the chapter I posted really needs to be the second chapter rather than the first. I've just started on the new first chapter, and I wanted to get some feedback on how the beginning of it reads. A book needs to capture a reader right off the bat! Let me know how I'm doing so far.

&gt;“Yo, wake up, stupid!” Instead of the usual sunbeams filtering through the holes in his tent, Damon woke to a dirty rag in his face. He tossed it aside in disgust and sat up, rubbing his eyes.

&gt;“Christ, Jorge,”  he said. “I was almost done with that dream. Would’ve been up in a second.”

&gt;“No time for dreamin' - it’s huntin’ time!” Jorge grinned as he patted his rifle.

&gt;“Fine, yeah, I know.” Damon pushed aside his blanket and stood up. “Got a plan for today?”

&gt;“Figured we could give the city a shot. The outskirts, at least. Maybe we can find some pigeons or something. Oh, or some cats!” Jorge rubbed his stomach. “I could really go for some cat meat.”

&gt;“Maybe we will.” Damon chuckled. “Yeah, the city sounds good. Want to hit the south side? I know I’ve seen decent-sized flocks there.”

&gt;“Um, duh. What, did you want to walk to the north side? Come on, grab your crossbow. I’ll be waiting outside.” Jorge left the tent, whistling a tune without any apparent melody or key.

&gt;Damon yawned and walked to the other side of the tent, where he kept his hunting gear. He wished Jorge had let him finish the dream. He had been in the middle of a heated fight with a hero-elite from before the Hero War, and had almost defeated the foe. Soaring through the air and throwing punches that would obliterate a non-hero, he loved the thrill of bashing an invincible man through the wall only to have him return with a volley of high-energy kicks. He would often have these dreams, the battles going on for hours on end. The carnage was satisfying - the more they destroyed, the more powerful he felt. In his dreams, Damon was a god. Of course, every morning he would wake up to his normal body, powerless without his knife and crossbow. And every morning, as he strapped on his boots and slung his backpack and crossbow over his shoulder, he wished he could return to the dream world.

""Whalefall""

Bluebonnet grabs tight to her mother’s skirts. Bluebonnet has short legs but she moves them fast, quick little rotors propelling her forward into the thick rainy woods. She has practiced running on their tiny farm, from chickens that were friends that she pretended were monsters. She is prepared for this run in the woods.

Bluebonnet’s mother pulls Bluebonnet’s arm almost out of its socket because she can hear the wolves at their back. Bluebonnet’s mother just needs to get her daughter out of the woods. Then Bluebonnet and her mother can go live in the city, with real friends and walls and high fences to keep out the wolves.

The wolves catch the scent of the little girl. The wolves are hungry and haven’t eaten in days. The wolves have cubs that need meat, that grow thin and ribbed like a pinecone. And they need to learn by example, how to smell a girl a thousand trees away, how to nip at little feet to keep them moving faster than is healthy, which trees are allies, that lay traps, that want to share in the feast and so prop up their roots, hungry for toes, because yes there are trees that are also nourished by girls.

Bluebonnet is getting tired of running. The chickens never breathed hot on her calves, making them heavier and sweatier than before. The chickens gave up when she turned and gave a shout. The chickens never made chilling shouts of their own. There was never more than two of them. There are at least six wolves she can count from the corners of her eyes.

Bluebonnet’s mother remembers her own first trip through the forest. She remembers being small, but not that small. She remembers being tired but how her mother kept her running, kept whispering strength in her ear. She tries to whisper, but maybe she doesn’t whisper as well as her mother did. Maybe she should have spent another year on the farm. Maybe she should have fed her daughter more meat and fewer apples. Maybe this is all her fault.

The wolves know that the chase is over. Everything that happens now is just for fun. Some of them put their bodies between Bluebonnet and her mother. The rest of them surround Bluebonnet and take deadly bites out of her. It isn’t time for eating now, only for killing. When Bluebonnet falls dead on the ground, then it is time for eating. They don’t need much, and after they eat her jaws and her tongue they wander sated back into the mists of the wood.

Bluebonnet sinks into the ground. When she was running she thought it was solid, and she was right, solid enough to run on. But now that she’s not moving it sucks up around her sides like quicksand and she’s falling into a dark loamy world underneath the forest. She doesn’t know where her mother went, but she wants to tell her that she is sorry.

The hags that live in the dirt find Bluebonnet’s body. They are hungry too, but they depend on other killers for food. Everything from the surface ends up down here for them eventually, in their moist tunneled kingdom. Mushrooms. Leaves. Sometimes baskets of bread. A lot of bodies. Their mouths are old and rotting and none of them have all their teeth but together they rasp little holes in Bluebonnet, helping each other feast.

Bluebonnet wants to explain to the hags the difference between dead and dead but she can’t find her tongue. She is dead, but she can still feel the vibrations in the ground that shudders every time a mole or a snake passes by. She can still feel the wet soil on her skin, finally cold and damp after all the hot sweat that poured off of her during the chase. She hurts for a little while, but eventually the rumbling of the soil lulls her to sleep. She doesn’t wake up.

The hags keep eating until nothing is left. They take turns picking out bits of meat stuck in each other’s teeth. The ones with shorter fingernails find amusement in combing each other’s hair while the longer fingernailed hags begin digging a new tunnel. They can smell more meat to the south.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1i6kzd,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1i6kzd/flash_fiction_fairy_tale_731_words/,

This is a creative non-fiction collection of stories and anecdotes, with recurring motifs such as the search for family and community, and questions whether masochism forms identity.

Warning: If you are triggered by alcohol, this will be an unhealthy read for you. I know it was for me. Your choice.

Please excuse the narcissistic preface and unnecessary etymological exposition at the beginning. It helped me as a place marker for the tone and concept of the text, and was intentionally confrontational so I could retain some distance and not take everything quite so seriously. At the least I hope it amuses you and informs you more than it is off-putting.

Any feedback is welcome! I would really like to know where your confusions were, and where the text became slow and un-purposed. Do you feel you need to know more? Less? One thing I am definitely concerned about is the pacing. The first chapter is really heavy on the expository, introducing themes, and the style of narration that will take place. Is there anything that could be removed for clarity sake? Essentially the first chapter is a proof of concept for the authority the narrator must take to take you along. Does it succeed?

“Jesus,” I think. “That's as far as he could make it?”

Somehow, the others at the burial service have convinced themselves that this was an admirable accomplishment.  After the last shovel of dirt is heaved over his casket, the mourners slowly shuffle back to their cars and make their way to the church basement for ham sandwiches.  Someone tells a few jokes about how stubborn Clarence was, and we all laugh as if we really knew him.  We pretend that the few personality traits that he had were different in some way than everyone else’s.  It’s all too scripted for me.  I need to go outside.  I need a cigarette.

I stand out of my steel folding chair and head for the stairs.  Why did I come here?  I only met my grandfather once, and even then we didn’t get along very well.  I push open the front doors of the church and let the crisp autumn air cool my face.  Why don’t churches have air conditioning?  I slide the silver lighter out of my pocket, and pull my second-to-last cigarette out of the pack.

“Shit, need to get more” I say to myself.

I lean against the brick façade of the church as I shield the lighter from the wind.  The end of my cigarette begins to glow and I take a drag.  I knew that I could get a minute alone out here.  Nobody smokes anymore.  I probably shouldn’t smoke either, but it’s times like these where I’m happy to have an excuse to get away. 

“What will God think?” I hear a woman say.

I look toward the source of the voice and immediately straighten my posture.  After seeing nothing but my dull and pudgy distant relatives for the past two days, she is as refreshing as the air that I came outside for.  Her brown hair is long and curly, spilling over delicate shoulders that clearly weren’t formed by a life of farm work.  She has a warm smile on her face as she makes her way over to me.  Her flip-flops and bright yellow sundress suggest that she’s not here for the funeral.  

“I’m sorry?” I manage to stammer.

“Smoking on the steps of the Lord’s house? Tsk, tsk!”  She says in a mocking tone. “There’s only one way to absolve yourself of your sins.”

“And what would that be?” I ask, feigning a need to repent.

“Help a stranger in need.  Got another one?” 

“Sure,” I blurt.  I pull out the pack of cigarettes and hold it out for her.

“Oh shit, I’m sorry.  I don’t need to take your last one,” she says, clearly meaning it.

“It’s ok.  If it means my sins are wiped clean, it’s worth letting a pretty girl take my last cigarette.”

She gives a good natured laugh and slips the cigarette out of the package and up to her lips.

“Just this one sin,” she says, as the cigarette bobs up and down in her mouth.  “You’re on your own with whatever other demons are following you.” 

While her attention is focused on lighting up, I take the opportunity to admire what is standing before me.  This woman, in her mid to late 20’s, has the appearance of someone who is truly beautiful without needing to try.  She is effortlessly thin, and her curly hair blows in the wind but never falls out of place.  There’s not a hint of make-up on her face, yet her skin is flawless.  She would turn heads at the most exclusive Hollywood party.  I can’t begin to imagine the sort of hypnotizing affect she has on the local men and boys in this hell hole.  She lights her cigarette and I bring my eyes back to hers.

“Nobody smokes anymore,” she says with a shrug.

I keep finding reasons to continue the habit.  A cigarette break is an entirely underrated advantage for smokers trying to get a girl, especially with the almost complete ban of smoking in public places.  You can’t even smoke in a bar anymore, for God’s sake.  Do we need to turn every place into a playground for babies and stuck-up moms who all but faint at the smell of a Marlboro?  But when you’re chatting with a girl, this annoyance can become a game changer.  If she smokes, she’ll happily bum a cigarette off of you, and voila!  You’re alone outside, away from her loud friends and away from the other guys that have been staring at her all night.  Or in some instances, you’re alone outside of your grandfather’s funeral and away from your loud Aunt’s and creepy cousins that have been staring at you all day.

“What’s your name?” I ask.

“I don’t know,” she answers with a smile, “technically, it’s Flower.”

She slowly exhales and a plume of smoke billows out of her slightly up-turned nose as she continues, “but growing up, my parents called me everything: Poppy, Lilac, Iris, Ginger.” 
She can see that I’m confused.

“They were hippies, basically.  My name usually changed depending on what flowers were in bloom.  After they passed away, I decided that it would be best to pick one name and stick with it.”

“So what did you chose?”

“Daisy,” she says, “I always enjoyed it when they called me that.  When the Daisies were going out of season, I would spend extra time in our garden with them, hoping they would last longer and my parents wouldn’t change my name.” 

“I think you chose well.  It fits you.”

Daisy blushes slightly.

“Are there a lot of hippies in Iowa?” I ask.

“Two or three at a time, depending on the schedule,” she responds, “have you ever heard of Stockton’s Oak?” 

I shake my head.

“In the 60’s, a lot of young people were hearing about the hippie movement happening in California, so they started moving in huge numbers from the Midwest and East Coast across the country toward San Francisco.”

I nod to show that I’m following along.

“Well,” she continues, “it turns out that Iowa is a good resting point for weary travelers.  It also happened that a lot of them were very short on money, so they would stop in Webster City for seasonal work in the fields to make enough for the rest of their trip.  They would stay in little camps on the edge of the fields at night and work during the day.  One of the farmers, Edward Stockton had a huge oak tree at the outskirts of his land that his workers would gather under to share food and crafts.  They figured the oak was at least 350 years old.  A migrant worker at the farm even built a little hut in the branches that provided some privacy.”

“Sounds almost like a commune,” I say.

“You could call it that,” she continued, “well, Ed Stockton wasn’t very happy about the things that these ‘dirty hippies’ were doing on his property, so one day he came to the edge of his fields with a chainsaw and told his workers that he was taking it down.  By that point, the tree had become a sort of counter-culture landmark, and people traveling through to California made a point to stop and rest by ‘Stockton’s Oak’.  It wasn’t just his workers anymore.  Anyway, can you guess what a group of hippies will do when you tell them you’re cutting down their favorite tree?”  She takes a drag from her cigarette.

I laugh, “I can think of a few things.  Did they chain themselves to the tree?”

Daisy exhales, “Exactly.  They chained and locked themselves in a circle around the tree, climbed into the branches and piled into the hut.  Stockton called the police, but they didn’t have the resources to get rid of everyone.  They told the police and Ed that they would stay there as long as they had to.  For his part, Ed promised to cut the tree down one way or another, no matter how long it took.”  She made sure to give me a grimace to enhance the story.  “One of the people in that tree was my mother, Ruth.  She left her home in Pennsylvania after her parents had passed away in a car accident.  Her father was a successful business man, and she inherited a lot of money when they died.  My mother didn’t need to make any extra money before she got to San Francisco, and she wasn’t working for Stockton.  She was one of the travelers who had heard of the tree and made a point to stay for a few weeks.”

“What did your grandfather do?”

 “What do any people do?” She answered.  “I think he owned a bunch of appliance stores in the Northeast.  My mother didn’t talk about her parents much.  And back then she didn’t want any of the others at Stockton’s farm to know that she had all of that money. Most days she would pitch in around the farm and would tend the garden that was planted around the oak.  She was planning on going all the way to the West Coast, but she had become fond of living with everyone around the tree.  She couldn’t imagine that old oak being gone, and all of the life around it drying up.  So one night, she came out of the tree and she went to Stockton’s front door.”
I was mesmerized.  I had finished my cigarette minutes ago, but I had no intention of going back inside.  I could listen to her speak forever.

“When Stockton came to the door, she asked him how much he wanted for his farm.  He said something like, ‘more than you hippies can offer’.  She told him that she had money, and she was willing to write a check then and there.  So a few days later, the paperwork was finished and my mother had a farm.  Of course, she didn’t know anything about running that kind of operation.  She just wanted the tree, so soon after, she sold most of the farmland back to one of the locals and kept just enough land for the oak tree, a small house, some tents for the traveling workers, and a garden.” 

Daisy finished her cigarette now, and gently dropped it at her feet.  She brought down her foot and slowly twisted to put it out.  I discreetly watched her as her leg muscles flexed and showed their definition.  She bent down and picked up the extinguished butt and placed in a garbage can near the door.

“After my mother bought the land, the traveling workers would stay with her while they were in Webster City.  Everyone wanted to stay in the hut that was built in the tree, but most ended up in the tents underneath.  She never accepted any payment at first, but many of the workers made sure to show their appreciation by making clothes for her, or giving her paintings, or even bringing fresh fruits and vegetables.  She did this for many years and lived on her inheritance, but eventually the money started to run out and there were fewer and fewer workers passing through town.”  Daisy turns her head and frowns,  “Sorry.  I’m just going on and on now”

She looked upset.  I could tell that this story was meaningful to her.  

“No, go on.  It’s better than going back in there and hearing my Uncle Gary talk about how there are more corns on his feet than in all of the fields in Iowa.”

This elicits genuine laughter from Daisy, and I see that she no longer looks upset.

“My mother decided that it would be alright to ask for just a little bit of money, so she started charging for the right to stay in the hut.  Turned out, people were more than happy to hand over a few dollars for a night in the tree.  Before she knew it, she was taking reservations and basically running a business.”

“So is it still there?” I ask.

“Of course,” Daisy answers, “Stockton’s Oak is a counter culture landmark, even to this day.  Sentimental hippies trek here like it’s their Mecca.  But it’s not as quaint as it used to be.  Over time, my mother was able to charge more and more as her generation got older and more successful.  There’s only one tree, and only one hut in that tree, so I’m sure you can figure it out.  Supply and demand.”

I nod appropriately.

“But now that it’s just me, I’m the one who has to make sure that it doesn’t all go to shit.”

“Where is this tree?  I’d love to see it.” 

“How long are you in town for?” She questions.

“I’m not sure yet.  Maybe a few days.”  I had planned on leaving as soon as possible, but I really had no place to be.  Suddenly, I couldn’t think of anywhere better than Webster City.

“Well, I’d be happy to show it to you.  It’s called Stockton’s Oak.  Ask around.”  She says as she does a half spin and walks around the side of the church and out of sight.

After three years, I can’t even manage your name. It’s a four-letter word to me now. But you know who you are. It’s been about three years, by my count, since—I admit it—I broke your heart. I was stupid, and (comparatively) young, and looking for a way out. Fortunately, (or not, depending on your perspective) I found one. It was inelegant, stupid, and humiliating. And I’m sorry. I’m sorry that I so disingenuously pulled the rug out from under you, and I’m sorry that I had second thoughts for a while. It wasn’t fair to you. I am a lying, low-life, no-account, dirty rotten scoundrel for what I did to you. But at least I accept that. You, on the other hand, got to play the victim for a few months, and then, when it suited you, you turned your puppy-dog eyes on somebody else. And then another somebody else, and then another somebody else after that. It was equally low, only you couldn’t seem to admit it to anyone, least of all, to yourself. For you, it was a-okay, and anyone who told you otherwise got an earful. I learned all this secondhand. Could you see me? Laughing at you from the peanut gallery? (I’m sorry for laughing, by the way.)
	
Three years later, I’m with somebody else. We’ve been together almost two years at the time that I’m writing this. I love her very much, which surprised me at first, to be honest. Remember when you told me that you loved me? I wasn’t so sure about that, but I tried it on for size. It seemed to fit at the time. It fits a lot better now, thanks for asking. You’re with someone else, too. I assume he makes you happy. You’ve been together a while, and it seems to be going strong. Congratulations! I mean it, I’m glad you’ve found your person. It’s nice to see that you’re actually happy, instead of just pretending for the sake of having someone in your life.


I assume you’re wondering why I’m writing to you—or you would if you were to ever read this. Today, while cleaning up my room, I found the valentine you sent me. I had hidden it away upon receiving it in the mail, in what should have been a telling sign that our relationship was doomed. But today, I found it; pinks and reds, and hearts and kisses, and all of it insincere. Do you want to know how I know that? I didn’t realize it until today, but reading it over, I discovered that you didn’t say a damned thing about us. You said plenty of things about me, and one or two things about you, but I could tell just from reading it that you liked mailing the card a lot more than you liked writing it. I read it once, and it made me sick. I read my name at the top and yours at the bottom, and the card and the envelope it came in became toxic. I closed the card and wondered what the fuck this card was still doing in my life, when you are so permanently, satisfyingly gone. At first, I considered throwing it in the trash, or running it over with my car, or something like that. In the end, I just burned the damned thing. It was the only permanent, satisfying solution that I could think of. And it was. As I sat there and watched it burn, I thought about poetry. I thought about how a poem is a flash. It’s just a moment of intense emotion, consumed by, I don’t know, a butane torch, or maybe a few good lines of verse. Watching the reds and pinks crinkle and char to blacks and browns and grays, I felt that flash. I’m writing this because that three-year-old valentine is out of my closet, and now it’s a grease spot on my driveway. Now I can say, without an inkling of doubt, that you are gone from my life for good. It was a long time coming, and now it’s here. Ding-dong, the witch is dead. Good night and good riddance. I don’t think I ever loved you.

1372271580.0,12,self.KeepWriting,1h4hkf,The Worst Time of My Life,arshem,15,3,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1h4hkf/the_worst_time_of_my_life/,"It was October 8, 2010. Nearing the peak of 3 AM my wife is finally in active labor. The doctor was at the end of the bed waiting for our son to make his appearance. The epidural had long went silent and my wife was in pain. She pushed as hard as she could when she felt a large contraction. Ultimately it became fruitful and our son entered our world. 

He was covered in a white film with little blood covering his naked body. The doctor joked when I mentioned the size of my son's package saying, ""Dad, it's not genetic."" The doctor tickled my son's feet in efforts to make him cry out, but nothing came. They immediately took him to the warming table and rubbed my son's body with a warmed towel to try and wake him up. His skin was still pale as they wiped away the film that covered him. He had his eyes shut and was barely breathing. I looked back at my wife as she was trying to dodge the nurses that surrounded our son with her field of vision. I smiled at her, trying to give her faith that everything would be okay.

A moment later, they told us that he needed oxygen and they rushed him to the nursery. He was born at our local hospital, and they didn't have a neonatal intensive care unit. They only had a nursery where all babies went when the mother requested it. There was no request for him to be taken away. I looked back at my wife and looked toward the door where they took away our son. I was stuck, not knowing whether to comfort my wife or go with my son. We had two children in the waiting room, wanting to see their little brother.

The doctor was focused on my wife as she told me she was okay and to go find out what I could from the nurses. Hyaline Membrane disease is what they called it. James' lungs were affected and the little hairs that help push out liquids during aspiration fail to do their job. They are slicked down like glass allowing anything to enter. His lungs were sticking together because of this and he was put on a CPAP machine to help keep his lungs inflated.

I was devastated that something like this could happen to my son. The doctor told us that being 4 weeks early wasn't a big deal because the latest ultrasound showed his lungs to be perfectly healthy. Unfortunately ultrasounds cannot show hyaline membrane disease. My wife was bed ridden for most of his stay in the nursery. The day she was allowed to go back was a day and a half later. We knew he would have an extended stay, and they were letting us know what was going to happen. More family came, and I felt obligated to allow them to see James. The prognosis was good and they expected him to be out of the nursery in 7 days. However, we still couldn't hold him.

It was while I was letting our family see him that the worst few minutes of my life happened. My wife's aunt came running out of the nursery and into the waiting room where I was talking to other family. ""Something happened. You need to get back there now. He's not breathing.""

Everything stopped in the world at that moment. I ran through the closing nursery hallway doors while bumping into one of them. I staggered towards the nursery windows to see all the blinds shut tight. They were always open, but now they were not. A woman had just left the nursery and the door slammed shut behind her. I was locked out. The only way in was for someone to let me in and the nurses weren't opening the door. I ran to the desk and found no one there to let me back to see him. I could hear the faint solid beep of a heart monitor in a flat line. My heart deflated.

I ran back to the nursery door and pounded on it as hard as I could. A man opened the door a sliver but not enough to see his face. ""Is that baby yours?"" he asked me. I nodded with tears running down my face. My baby was dying and I couldn't see him. The man opened the door wide and I could see tears on his face too. Several nurses were lined around my son's bed. His oxygen tubes and hat was dangling off his makeshift bed. They were working on him as I approached, my wife crying by herself with no one there to comfort her.

I wrapped my arms around her as the nurses did their jobs to try and bring him back. My wife explained to me that they were checking his vitals and the monitor showed nothing wrong. It was at the exact moment a nurse was checking his lungs with a stethoscope that she found no heartbeat. We later found that heart monitors are actually several seconds behind, especially for infant monitoring. The nurse felt my son's lung collapse as the pressure from the CPAP caused a pneumothorax (a whole in his lung). 

They inflated his lung back by giving him a chest tube and started working back on his heart. He came back to us. He was only without oxygen for a couple of minutes yet it felt like hours. They called for a life line to a hospital that specialized in infants, Riley Children's Hospital. They couldn't helicopter him in, so we had to wait for a life-line ambulance to come stocked ready for a portable neonatal unit.

As they wrapped my son up as best they could to a gurney, we were told by one of the life-line nurses the list of things that could happen. We had to agree to them before they could take him, and one that stood out the most was possible death. My son had already defeated death once with the help of a special nurse who God placed there at the right time. We agreed and they rushed him off.

I was planning on leaving my wife at the hospital because she had not been released yet, but her doctor was there that night and released her so we could both be with our son. We left it to our family to figure out sleeping arrangements for our daughters as we packed and left to take the 45 mile trip to see our son again. The ambulance beat us by about 20 minutes, but we rushed up to the NICU as fast as we could. My wife was still in pain from laboring our son, but she kept the pace up. 

We waited for hours for him to become stable. It was nearly midnight and almost everyone was asleep in the NICU waiting room. People lived in the waiting room. We saw suitcases, blankets, pillows, and people strung all over it. It was our new home for several weeks while our son fought his way back to being healthy.

It took James 3 weeks to be healthy enough to come home. He went from being in the worst possible scenario at Riley (The ECMO station where they run a full heart and lung bypass) to being ready to come home in 3 long exhausting weeks. They were unsure of the outcome when he arrived, but they were the nurses there were by far the best we've ever met. They took care of James like he was their only child there.

After a week and a half there, he was running out of blood for tests. Little did we know, babies cannot produce their own blood supply until they are a few months old! The blood transfusion they gave him was the work of God. One day after the transfusion and they were able to lower his breathing tube to a lower rate. Three days later, he was off the breathing tube. A week later, he was able to be fed for the first time by feed tube. A week and a half later, he was in his car seat test, ready to come home.

James is now 2 years old and is a very rambunctious child. He has PDD-NOS, Auditory Neuropathy, SPD, Chiari Malformation, and general muscle weakness in his core, however he is perfect in our eyes. Never would we have imagined going through everything we have but looking back now, I wouldn't trade ANY of it for another child.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1h4hkf,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1h4hkf/the_worst_time_of_my_life/,

This was going to be the title of this post, and I was going to include an essay I wrote about self-publishing. But it turns out, I didn't really want a critique. I wanted the work to be published. So I opened my word processor and made some edits and put it online, [here.](https://sites.google.com/site/caesarnapleswiki/overview/ambitiously-i-created-a-6x9-pdf-for-publishing) Its theme is shown through a man who answers life questions with morality, and eventually the answers become too complex to find. Ambitiously, I created a 6x9 PDF for publishing. I thought I could throw in a few other essays and get a quick saddle-back going. The essays rolled off of presses, or floated down the pipe as they say.

I thought, ""Is this the right thing to do? Should I publish my works immediately in hardcopy form?""

I believe so. After all, I spent my entire high school and college career perfecting short answers and essays. If only they had been published! And the answers to the invisible questions of life like, ""am I happy?"" could be answered and published and finalized in a way through self-publishing. It's a little narcissistic, but I like to have my thoughts written down, and I don't need a best-selling book to justify creating a print copy of my writing.

What does reddit think?,SerendipitouslySane,11,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/xted0/a_scifimagitech_fiction_im_working_on_heres_the/,"**Prologue: Once More unto the Breach**

In 1914, a lucky assassin successfully disposed of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. 

The subsequent fallout set into motion the gargantuan wheels of diplomacy and hostility, resulting in four years of bloody conflict that tore Western Europe into two. When the dust settled on No Man’s Land, thirty seven million casualties lay in the mud-filled trenches and the derelict husks that used to be towns, out of which seventeen million would never rise again. 

At the end of it all, the leaders of the belligerent nations shook hands and smiled to each other, all the while humiliating the defeated atop a metaphorical mountain of corpses of an entire generation, lost to the follies of mankind.

They called it the Great War, or the War to End All Wars. Upon the epitaph of the countless nameless soldiers, the French inscribed two simple words, succinctly describing all contemporary sentiments:

Never Again.

In layman terms, “never” meant thirty years. 

In 1939, war broke out once more, on a scale that dwarfed its predecessor. The fires of conflict spread from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and the greatest nations of the world girdled themselves for six more years of death and destruction, claiming the lives of seventy million, until the successful nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki brought a resounding end to the slaughter. 

Learning from their past mistakes, historians dubbed the war with a more conservative “Second World War”, and rechristened the War to End All Wars with the sombre title of “First World War”.

The world sat in bated breath, waiting for the third instalment to descend upon the world with more unprecedentedly large scale destruction, only to be disappointed when several skirmishes on the frontlines quickly ended. With the Soviet Union, one of the two superpowers to emerge from World War II, collapsed peacefully, albeit with many issues, the world relaxed and, despite minor hiccups and recurring problems, peace seemed to be here to stay. Mutually Assured Destruction in the form of vast arsenals of nuclear weaponry discouraged any escalation in conflict, in fear of destroying all of earth in one ill-rationalized military move. Under such dynamic equilibrium of power, humanity prospered. 

It was in the year of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the end of the previous war when a game-changing discovery was announced: the technique for personal manipulation of sub-atomic particles within the newly discovered Petrovski-Huang Field and its associated bosons and fermions, more colloquially and appropriately dubbed “magic”, “magitech” or one of another dozen of memetically mutable names which come and go. The discovery of this technique took the world by storm, as millions declared it a new stage in human evolution. Progress was no longer limited by natural resources and bulky, expensive machinery as a learned and prepared Technician could summon miracles at his or her fingertips, given enough time to harvest energy from the environment, or a good sized external source of power. Thus was declared as the coming of the Singularity, and mankind was set to grasp an even brighter future with this newly developed field of study, in everlasting peace and harmony. 

But peace was never a trait our species was evolved for. 

Five years later, a brilliant, if naïve, idealist found the ultimate symbol of peace: an anti-nuclear radiation spell. By careful manipulation of the Petrovski-Huang Boson, an elegantly simple method of neutralising uncontrolled nuclear fission and fusion was created, allowing any moderately skilled Technician (a profession which, due to the need for extensive knowledge in physics, was still a minority) to disarm nuclear arsenals from a distance. With its announcement came a fad of defence research, and spells to disable or defend against modern military equipment appeared one after another. War was seen as an impossible endeavour. 

In hindsight, that kind of thinking was just asking for it to happen. 

China, gaining confidence and unity through its successful Technician development program, displayed its newly renovated hybrid army of Technicians and conventional soldiers to annex the autonomous island of Taiwan, itself a highly developed forerunner in both electronics and magitechnological engineer, rather peacefully, removing a thorn on the Communist Party government’s side that had been a source of tension and sticky politics since its rise to power eighty years ago. 

The United States of America, weakened by its slower grasp in Magitech and dividing politics, but nevertheless at the magnificent height of her power, sent the Seventh Fleet at the newly occupied island in an attempt to liberate a strategically important location with vital Magitech human resources. The resulting conflict was chilling to both sides, as three months of bitter fighting within the narrow Taiwanese Strait concluded only with a tenuous ceasefire that cemented the island’s neutrality. Both armies, accustomed to asymmetry in military strengths, reliance on exploitation of enemy weaknesses and superior firepower to obliterate any opposition, found the battle to be a dreadful deadlock. With the help of magic, originally devastating beyond-the-horizon artillery and precision missile strikes were reduced to inaccurate clatter with wide-spectrum sensor jamming Techniques. The unstoppable spear of the United States Armed Force was forced to clash with the unyielding hammer of the People’s Liberation Army in a bloody battle of close-quarter attrition. 

Escalation was much anticipated, as nations began to take sides, honouring age-old alliances and shaky contracts of mutual benefits. Western Europe, Israel and much of the Commonwealth pledged support for the United States, and stood under the flag of the New Alliance, while India, Russia and her ex-Soviet neighbours, with the support of anti-American Middle Eastern nations, joined the Chinese to form the Eurasian Pact. The divided states of Africa and Southern America locked themselves in battle, declaring for either side as history and politics dictated. 

Twenty years has passed since the Battle for the Taiwanese Strait, and little of the old world order was left recognizable. The Western Theatre was a near unbroken line of fortresses, bunkers and strongholds that extended from the eastern Finnish border to the Suez Canal, while the war in the Pacific had taken an odder geometry, with the Nanjing Military Region and the Seventh Fleet locked in a ceasefire in the seas surrounding Taiwan, now one of very few neutral states, unable to leave the island for fear of losing leverage upon the locale. The remainder of the Eurasian Pact, however, had established a beachhead in Southern California, and now sought to invade American home soil, all the while battling for naval supremacy and supply line security with the shattered but unbroken Third Fleet. The frontline was no longer a two-dimensional stretch on the ground either, as fighting extended into the stars atop flying fortresses and space installations, all the way to the moon. 

Civilian was no longer a valid concept; every human being on the planet lived, breathed and died in War. Schools were geared for military training by default, and career choices were limited to three distinct categories: fighting for the war, producing for the war and researching for the war. 

Those who recorded the events of this conflict quickly recognised the scale of it, and dismissed the continuing the numerical numbering from previous World Wars, whose scale and influence would classify as skirmishes in comparison with the unimaginable massiveness of this one. Instead, they pre-emptively numbered it the First Era of Eternal Conflict, or, to borrow Joseph Goebbels’ Sportpalast Speech made during the last Great War:

*“I ask you: Do you want Total War? If necessary, do you want a war more total and radical than anything we can even imagine today?”*

This is one such story, among millions untold, set in the time of the Second Total War; a period of grim darkness and sobering cruelty, of irreconcilable despair and unavoidable tragedies, but at the same time an age of heroism and romanticism, of unity and comradeship.

This is one such story.

She awoke to the heavy damp smell of her makeshift bedroom. Even through the metal grate that was her doorway she could tell that the streets had been washed clean. But it’s not like that would do a lot of good, the city still smelled like shit. It was impossible to clean the streets of the smell of sweat, fecal matter, tears, blood and whatever else could be shed from a human body. The girl sat up from her cardboard and old ragged clothed bed and crawled over to a small trench in her room. There was still some fresh water from the street cleansing. She tried to ease her mind of yesterday’s water deposit. Before she knew it, she had already brushed the water along her arms to clean herself and had layered her arms with a brown and sticky liquid. The smell had been beyond nauseating. She was forced to sneak into the upperclass park area to use a fountain to clean up before school that day. Doing so had its own dangers of being arrested so she only washed her arms. Fortunately today the water was clean enough to wash her entire body and it wasn’t very cold either. 

In mid scrub, the girl took the time to analyze what day it was. When confident that it was Saturday she allowed herself a little more leisure time to bathe. If it had been any other day then she would have expected the piercing horn from the school. For teenagers here, if you did not attend school then you worked in the ‘bowels’ and for many of those people, they never came back up to the surface. The girl dressed herself in her least raggedy of clothes and took note that her jeans were starting to feel a lot looser. When was the last time she had a full meal? Upon exiting her little hovel she pulled on a loose fitting brown coat that had belonged to her mother. This and some other mementos were all that the girl had left of her. 

A little compartment welded to her door held a thick white envelope that looked to have been shoved in hastily in the dark. Slowly and cautiously the girl pulled the envelope out. She worried that a rich person had seen her bathing in the park and may be blackmailing her or possibly inserted a bomb into her mailbox. These things did happen here. The upper class hated seeing her kind above her issued dimension. 

The thick envelope felt heavy and upon opening it, the girl saw that it was filled with a week’s worth of cash at least. Without questioning it, she pocketed the cash and threw the envelope into the street. After all, the street assembly would be by soon to clean it up as they always did. The air outside of her hovel wasn’t quite as stale but that was thanks to the cleaning during the darkness. Any other time the girl would leave with her face mask to insure that she wouldn’t have to inhale any unpleasant scents on her way out. Fortunately, today wasn’t so bad. 

She gazed up at the Arti-Sun, wondering that if from this far down in the dimensions was this as close to the real thing that was felt at home? Her stomach growled in sudden, angry protest. 

“I think I will have thai today”, she decided. 

The streets were crowded as usual and the cheap markets were advertising their daily deals of the third rate food that the upper dimensions didn’t want. She passed by their offers of four day old artificial fish and beef that tastes almost but not quite like the real thing. This girl was on a mission for thai food and there was only one particular place to get it.

Shaped like the handle of a dagger, long and slender but roughly rounded as if the gem cutter had run out of sand cloth and left it with edges and faces, it was lighter than it appeared.  It had to be.  He thought of the drawing of the crown he had seen when he was child, the crown that Telus wore.  It was a massive thing.  A line of glyphs carved into the silver band with the seven, large black stones like the one he held lining the outside with silver filigree that wound around each to hold them in place.  Unknowably powerful.
He closed his fingers around the stone.  He closed his eyes and slowed his breathing while he called up the words of the spell.  Each of the glyphs flashed in his mind and he muttered them out loud.  
The stone warmed in his hand.  He could feel the energy begin to snake from the surface and through his flesh.  He whispered the words and the stone started to vibrate gently in his grip.  The shift opened in front of him.  He could feel the radiance even before he opened his eyes to watch it form.  The room brightened like the sun bursting through an open window.  A thin blue pane of light hovered in front of him washing in and out of his vision.
Energies from the stone moved like lightning from his hand and sparked against the shift, popping and sizzling along the edges.  He couldn’t help but grin.  The shift was almost complete; the tentacles of power from the stone faded and left the gateway glimmering and translucent, ready.
Rhenarde stood, slipped the stone into his pocket, closed his eyes and stepped into the liquid blue light.  
The magic ran along his skin as he stepped through.  Every nerve in his body tingled as pressed through the peel of light that separated where he was and where he was going.  Instantly, his whole body was swathed in swirling, pulsing tendrils of blue light.  He felt weightless, floating in nothingness.  The room around him faded and a forest came into view.  The trees, bushes, and earth were ghostly at first, as if they were lying on top of the room he had been standing in, a second layer on top of the first, but slowly they sharpened.  First the trees darkened, their trunks, branches, and leaves started to take shape and substance while more and more of the tiny room, the small cot, the wooden floor, and the lonely candle on a stand in the corner started to fade.  The shift silently dissipated and his bare feet were standing on yellow and red leaves.  
He stood in a forest.  There was a crisp, clean smell to the air and he took a breath and filled his lungs with it.  It was still warm, but there was something in the air.  Change, he thought.   Autumn.  Almost winter.   He dug his bare toes into the cool dampness of the earth.  He didn’t care that he had simply appeared in the forest, that to anyone around, he had just walked through a brilliant blue light the way someone walks through a door.  None of that mattered.  It felt good not be on a boat, good to be on solid ground.  He closed his eyes and relished the sensation while the man he had come to see slowly walked his horse to his side.
The rider stared straight ahead, his features, save the long golden hair, were lost in the shadow of his cowl.  “How far have you come?”  The voice was soft but stern.
“The captain says we will pass through the strait on the morrow.”
“Good.”  There was no comfort in the reply; the man didn’t even turn his head.  “Why are you here?”
“Simply to report,” Rhenarde held his tongue.  He wanted to say more, but it was impossible not to sense Velne’s mood; he was displeased to see the mage.  
“You have done so,” he lifted the reins of his horse and started to walk deeper into the forest.
Rhenarde watched him go.  Velne had been right, they had agreed that no further meetings were required, but he had justified the action in his own mind.  They were supposed to be allies, equals even, but Velne had always treated him like he was a child - a feeling with which he was all too familiar.  “The day is coming!” He shouted after the elf and his horse’s ass.  “Soon we’ll hold the crown and all of its power.”
“Yes,” Velne said without turning or emotion, “but you must find it first.”
It was too much.  The words cut through him and he felt the anger stir in his belly.  He suddenly wanted to chase the elf down, tear him from his horse and bloody his face with his fists.  Is there no one who believes I can do it?  No one who thinks I will find the five remaining stones and the crown that held them? Even he, the only other person in the world who possesses one, doesn’t think I can do it.  
He reached into his pocket, slipped his fingers around the stone, and summoned the shift again.  It only took a moment and he was back in the little cabin.  The floor gently rose and fell beneath his feet as the ship slipped along the waves.  He glanced down at his feet and found a wet yellow leaf clinging to his toe.  The stone went dark and cooled in his hand.  
A sigh escaped him and he wondered again about the trust he had placed in the elf.
Over the past months since he had begun the journey toward Trist, Velne had never answered Rhenarde’s questions about how he had obtained the stone.  He was always quick to change the subject, but Rhenarde had an idea of where the elf had gotten it.  There is no reason he couldn’t have been there. Elves live a long time.  It was the same question that had plagued him for months, but the Magus had assured him that Velne was of little consequence, that what the elf had done or did in the future could not change Rhenarde’s fate.  There was some little comfort in that, but he still wondered about the elf.  Couldn’t help but wonder. 
He pulled the yellow leaf from his toe and held it up to the light of a candle.  It was from a tree he didn’t know, the five points spreading out like fingers on an open hand.  He spun the stem between his fingers and watched the leaf twirl until there was a knock at his door.  “Yes,” he tucked the stone back into his robe, “what is it?”
“If there is nothing else, milord.”  It was Ayhn, his young footmen, standing out in the great room waiting for permission to retire.    
“Go find your bed, Ayhn.  I need nothing else this evening.”  He heard the boy walk to his room and close the door before he removed the stone again and stared into its darkness.  I know the rest are there.  
Since he had been a child Ayhn’s age, before he was old enough to become an acolyte at the temple, he had been listening to the tales of the temple scribes, imagined wielding the crown’s power.  
The crown and the stones were legend in T’ul, lost in history save for the Magus’ stories, books and dusty scrolls, but they had held a special place in his mind.  He had grown up with the legend of Telus and the Dark Temple, the last battle of his grandfather’s grandfather almost three hundred years before his birth.  The way a vine grows around whatever it finds; his life had ground around the stories and legends, they had molded his life to a purpose.  They fueled his faith in a cause everyone else either thought was madness or impossible.  But it is possible.  I will reclaim the throne.  I will raise an army the likes of which Trist has never seen, and I will sit in Mhethyr and wear the crown of my ancestors.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1jwts4,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1jwts4/feedback_does_this_chapter_grab_you/,

The clock marked 7:37. Three seconds passed unnoticed after what memories started to surface. She curled and waited for the tears to flow. Only self-hate came. Then, as she let the anger vent, her skin reminded why. Images of last night begin to take shape.


&gt;Early afternoon she texted The First 'hey babe I'm gonna drink with my college buddies, kisses. =x' and jumped on The Second's backseat, saying hi to everyone in the car. He would become The Second only hours and liters later, but the guilt took the memory wheel and painted him as The Second right there, making that occasion significant.

&gt;Arriving at the bar she sat on the third's table along everybody else. She drank a beer and talked and smiled and drank another beer and another one, in next bar. So fluidly that not even her would recognize the little spark clicking as she left to another place.

&gt;She feels the slight numbness of the booze tender her joints as she walks. Slowly, she allows herself the feelings. Its been six months. his arms - The First's arms - enclosing her in the near future, when hands can follow intentions, almost keep the mild cold of the moist in the air from borrowing heat from her skin.

&gt;On the way back to the car, she plays with the third, leaving herself to be carried by him as she smiles, resting her head against his legs. And yet she craves a touch. The third could do nothing: even the wrong touch requires the right moment.

&gt;At the club, memories are only carried by the trace of excitement. Her body followed the music, slowly feeling the warmth of The Second's body next to her, as he put his hands on her hip. She suppress the reaction to pull away, as if he had completed the song with the perfect dissonant chord. She keeps on dancing. Now, Smiling. Surely, there was a kink. But it lives too close to the guilt, so she keeps them locked. His hands guide her around, she follows the motions and finishes it with a kiss. He initiates the second and afterwards all of them just melt into a single, meaningful intertwining of bodies that would end up in her bed some miles away.

&gt;She conceded the many regions of her skin the reminder the moist of a kiss. It was enough to just feel. To let in the warmth of someone who needed her as much as she needed someone. Her giggles only stopped when he kissed her mouth shut. She enclosed him with her legs, pulling him further into her, making every backward movement of his a small suspension of breath away from ecstasy, leaving her balancing on the edge of conscious and bliss. Eyes went obliquous. Breath stopped. A impulse crawled up her spine, stronger and stronger until it exploded. She screamed and grabbed him with all her strength, melding their bodies as close as it possible. She stares at the ceiling, feeling numb and ecstatic. Nothing was on her mind.

&gt;He kisses her goodbye and leaves. 

&gt;She walked back to bed, but stopped at the bathroom. Threw up on the toilet as if she could extract the guilt out of her. She couldn't. She cried herself to sleep. 

&gt;The clock marked 7:44. She got some seconds more of empty thoughts. She got up. She took a shower. She talked trivialities on the internet. The day went by. But, through those long hours she could never escape the feeling that she broke one fundamental string inside that would never heal. It would, long after, when she understands that imperfection can coexist with beauty. But, for now, all she could do was to keep her mind empty. 




Ok, little disclaimer: that storie kind of happened to me (I'm the third =( ) with some poetic interpretation, of course. I challenged myself to understand another person's point of view and that came out.

Mid thought, something shadowed in the corner of the room caught his eye. Something had moved… perhaps a spider? He shuddered at the thought. He was terrified of spiders. He tried to return his thoughts back to the task at hand.

“What do you think it will be like to…” He began, still nervous about the question. He looked up to his grandfather, who was returning his stare intently.

“Die?” Ernest replied with a slight smile. His guess was confirmed as the boy nodded sheepishly, returning his gaze back to the floor.
The thought had crossed the man’s mind many times in the past few days. In fact, he'd found it hard to keep his mind off the subject. He was a catholic man at heart. He and his family had lived in Rome before coming to the US weeks before his 12th birthday. And yet, even growing up minutes away from Vatican City, he found himself questioning his faith now in his last days. Was his god as forgiving as the scriptures had promised? Perhaps his god wasn't even there to forgive.

“I think,” he paused and closed his eyes, trying to figure out how to put his thoughts into words suitable for a 13 year old boy. “I think that it will be a bit like being in a dark room.”

The boys brow furrowed, he was obviously confused. “No God? No heavens gates? Just a dark room?” He almost sounded angry at his grandfathers answer. *He raises me as a Catholic, and now he questions our faith?* Once again the spider moved in the shadow, he cringed and averted his eyes.

He thought back to all the Sunday mornings at church, and all the times they had planned trips to the Vatican, never following through. Thomas’s father had passed away when he was too young to even realize it, and his mother was constantly traveling for work. His grandfather had raised him, and Thomas knew that this could very well be their last talk. He’d been on the verge of tears since the conversation began.

“You did not ask.” Ernest began, smiling gently at his grandsons confusion. “Where I’ll go when I die. You asked what I thought it would be like.”

Thomas thought about what his grandfather had said. *Are those not the same questions? And what does a dark room have to do with anything?*

“So your saying your scared.” Thomas said, realizing what his grandfather was implying. “Because people are afraid of the dark.”

“Exactly.” 

“You're scared to die?” Thomas asked. His grandfather was extremely kind, but fear wasn't in his vocabulary. 

“Not quite.” His grandfather began, only adding to the boys confusion.

“When you're in the dark, what are you afraid of exactly?” 
 
“I’m not sure what you mean grandpa.” Thomas said, still visibly confused.

 “I don’t know what I’m afraid of.”

“But that’s just it.” His grandfather said with a gentle smile. “The unknown is what you fear, as do I.”

He waited for his grandsons response, but it did not come. The boy was not only awaiting elaboration on this dark room, but also fighting back tears. He enjoyed nothing more than these talks with his grandfather. He always knew how to word things perfectly, how to guide the clueless young boy through any obstacle he had encountered. But within a few days…

Thomas wiped his eyes and fought to keep a straight face. This was no time to cry. His grandfather only needed positivity. 

“This fear - of the unknown - applies in more than just a dark room you see.” His grandfather continued, seeing clarity in the boys eyes.

“We’re afraid because we don’t know what happens when we die.” The boy said, suddenly realizing what his grandfather was getting at.

“Good!” His grandfather exclaimed excitedly, sending him into a coughing fit. He motioned towards the tissues and Thomas passed them his way.   

“Very good.” Ernest continued, calmer this time. “For it is not the absence of light that we fear, but what lies beyond the shadows.”

As Thomas let the meaning of the words sink in, a cool breeze came through the window sending shivers down each of the men's spine, and sending an old gum wrapper out of the corner and into Thomas’s view.

I was speaking with a friend who is in university taking a course in gender studies. We had a long subway ride, so she offered me a book to read, which described the psychoanalysis of subjectivism within trans peoples. It's had some interesting challenges to the cartesian idea, and a more nuanced expression of the way people approach the ownership and ideas of their body.

I only was able to read a few chapters, and am not used to academic writing, so most of it went over my head... but it got me thinking.

She was helping me look over a draft of my short story, and wandered by the preface I had written, which is signed: 
please enjoy eating me,
with love, Zach.

She asked me why I had written that, and I said something lame and uncomfortably biblical; I said it's a joke that what you're consuming is me really.

So thinking of this, my mind stewing in these cartesian conflicts, I sat down and wrote on this hazy prompt about subjectivism in a way that would seem more familliar to me, and allow me to play to my strength. My strength being dick jokes, of course. That and being uncomfortable.

So I give you, for the eating:

Subjectivism and the story of Bob's Cock.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Do you regret the eating?

You know about those two guys in Germany? The one that ate the other one. Well never mind that one. What about the guy who was eaten?

Let's call him Bob.

From what I can remember, the delicacy of that backyard barbeque was Bob's cock. I'll give you a minute to go through that mental list of puns. Good.

What I wonder is, when he was sitting there on that shitty lawn chair with an ice pack on his lap and a stiff drink in his hand, did he regret it? Did he long for it? The potential, the part of him?  Did he think,  this thing was never opposable, never any use outside it's potential, this role I've assigned it in my life? This thing that is only gripped, but can never grasp? Something similarly defeatist?

Was it nihilistic? Did he weep into his shorts in arousal of the idea? Bleed hopefully into the absence of it? So eager to see himself consumed, did he relinquish the subjectivity he'd placed on himself, on his body. Or did he watch sentimentally, remembering each inch of encounter and discovery, and burn it away like a love to forget? Leading from that, I wonder if he relinquished the subjectivity of the impoverished eastern european girl  he had a victory lap wank to before the big cook off. Perhaps she was only a background character in the story of his penis, not per se part of the larger canon.

Stories are kind of like Bob's offering, they are a part of someone. Only with your imagination, they become useful beyond their potential, malleable beyond their premise. Only in your imagination are they defeatist, without purpose beyond self pleasure. Only in your imagination are they exciting in the conceit of the destruction and symbolic in their intimacy.

Stories, like genitalia, are quantifiable manifestations of potential for the purpose of potential. They serve as a member of you, and, we'd like to think, uniquely a brief member of others. But without you, they'll just sit on the grill. Lacking the subjectivity and drive you've assigned them. As much meat as you are. As much a part of you and your lover as your last meal. Right?

Once Bob released that meaning from himself, was his member's implied potential and value now only consummate through digestion and consumption? That part of him just protein to paint the walls of some bathroom stall, pieces of him written in what was him, without attribute? The same relation as a phantom cock to an eastern european girl without a name? If that's true then all meaning assigned to this part of him in the schema of his life, is now gone. Cooked for dinner and wiped away. It never meant anything anyways.

Or maybe.

Maybe Bob's cock, is part of the circle of life, the potential, the imagination of potential,  the realization of purpose and pleasure, and the meaninglessness in its destruction and sameness. Maybe that's what a story is, maybe that's the transformation when you remove a part and offer it. Maybe that's what Bob's cock is now, a prolonged end. Given new imagination by an act. A new purpose through devaluement. Maybe that's what the eastern european girl's picture is, and extension to the end of her body?

But maybe some day Bob's cock will be flowers, his discovery and encounters written in a meadow in mulch, picked by the stem to inspire arousal in a pretty eastern european girl. Another poor soul to bleed hopefully into the absence, longing to fill and be filled with ideas. Maybe she too will separate herself, in an effort to grow in others? Maybe that's the lesson Bob's cock is teaching us?

When a guy eats another guy's sausage, when Bob put's himself back in the food chain, for who knows why — maybe we're meant to remember we're all the same, we're all meat, and the meaning we've given ourselves and our parts isn't just in the cut, but in the butcher who understands the animal, who understands both consumption and meaninglessness, but values the intimacy and sanctity of being for a brief moment, a part of something else. Maybe the animals self worth wasn't tied so much to it's shank, and maybe the meaning of the shank isn't just in the butcher. Is it just meat to either of them?

Maybe Bob wanted to be his own butcher, his own understanding knife and intimate meal to share. Maybe he wanted to be his own circle of life, a snake eating it's tail forever. 

But Maybe, you could imagine a sausage as a part of you as much as you can imagine yourself as part of a sausage. Maybe you can strap one on, and create a history for each inch, and include a small imperial dedication to honor the eastern european girl in some oscar meyer nativity scene. You could have your cock and eat it too, if you're into that.

Maybe what you eat of yourself and offer to others is just an idea - meaning you've placed, and people have placed in you. Maybe that meaning is only a light meal, but that doesn't mean it couldn't be an intimate part of you and another. Maybe it can't grasp, but it can be gripped, and vice versa. 

The thing is, we could too assign our own meanings, and release them, imagine them and then amputate them, we could eat each other, and soon be flowers, like Bob's cock. All without mutilation. The meaning isn't in the meat or the knife, the hand or the cock: but in the mind. Maybe that's what a story is, just an extension animated by an idea, as much as you are. As much a part of you and your lover as a high speed internet connection, or a look exchanged across a room. As much a part of you as your first kiss and your last meal.


I think what Bob didn't need was the barbeque.

______________________

Chapter 1

“Why did you do that?” Charles asked through his swollen lips. The words came out more anxious and whiny than he had intended. The small woman behind him said nothing, but laid her head to the left and let out a panting breath.
Charles was sure that the crazy bitch was a drug addict and might have been sleeping next to the trashcans. She hadn’t said a word and had hit him twice without a warning. Broke two teeth and split his upper lip. Charles (or Pokey as his friends called him sometimes) could feel the remains of bone and enamel in his mouth and was getting annoyed with his wife. That damn Martha said she needed the trash out because the stupid onions smelled, and now look in what situation it had brought him. He doled out a mixture of teeth, blood and spit. “Lady, if you want money, my wallet is in my back pocket” Charles said. “Please Miss, nobody has to die because of...”.  The muzzle flash and the dry pop of a round from a Beretta Nano cut through the darkness and silence of the deserted side road.

The woman stood motionless with the small gun in her left hand, while the lifeless piece of flesh, that has been good old Charles seconds ago, was falling to the left and rolled slowly on its back.

Even in the lacking light of the back road it was easy to see that she had pointed the gun at the back of Charles head, and the hollow-point bullet had changed his face. A lot.

Charles right eye, part of his nose and cheek were gone, replaced by a dark hole from which blood, vomit and air erupted at a swiftly slowing pace. His right eye was pushed out of the socket and was staring at the night sky with chilling and steady indifference.

The emptiness in the woman’s face was replaced by curiousness and she kneeled down next to the steaming and bleeding head of Charles, left arm still holding the deadly little gun straight forward. As she watched the little volcano of bodily fluids from what once was Charles face, curiousness was replaced by something else.

She pointed the gun down, holding the grip of the Beretta in one hand, and the barrel in the other.
For a moment she was again motionless, a pose like a Mayan priest holding an obsidian knife over his sacrifice. 
 The woman took a sharp breath that sounded like air being sucked through a wet straw, and then she began to sink the gun barrel into the head wound of Charles.
She pushed and moved the barrel, avoiding bones and brain fragments and when she liked the position of the gun, she closed her eyes, removed her right hand from the barrel and pressed the trigger again.
With a muffled pop Charles remaining face exploded into a wave of Blood, meat and brain.

The woman, her face now sprayed with a red mist, opened her eyes again and lifted the gun. Still holding the Beretta in her left hand, she pointed it to her own face. She looked at the bloody barrel and muzzle for a moment with a disconnected intensity, opened her mouth, stuck out her tongue and touched the gun with it. Through the opened mouth, a sound between moan and hiss escaped her, and she closed her eyes.
She shoved the barrel of the gun into her mouth, and closed her lips around it.
Behind several windows up in the row of houses, lights were switched on, worried (or angry) citizens who heard the noise the shots had made.
In the new light source of half a dozen windows, it became evident that she was not only covered in darkening blood, but also contrasted by small pieces of Charles brain in her dark hair.
The woman began to move the gun like a lover might move his loins while receiving French love.
The gun barrel was thrusting forward and backward, glittering in the night lights from blood and spit.
The woman emitted muffled moans.
Soft clicks could have been heard, when the gun came in contact with one of ther teeth.

Voices shouted calls for the police and angry complaints about “keeping it down”. The cacophony of words reflected on the house facades, creating a chorus of noises that made absolutely no sense to the woman.

She seemed unaware of the sounds, and let her right hand wander into her yoga pants, and while sucking on the gun barrel, she began masturbating frenetically.
More, deeper and longer moans came from the woman’s throat, still muffled from the gun barrel in her mouth. The rhythm of barrel thrusting increased and with it began the oozing of a pink mixture of blood and spit from the corners of her mouth.
Additional to the rags of voices, police sirens began to scream their warnings from quite far away.

The woman did not pay any attention to the auditory panorama and continued her ritual.
Moans and little screams came from the woman’s mouth, mixed with a dark pink rain of more blood than spit, as the gun barrel had opened more than one gushing wound in the roof of her mouth.

People starred down from the windows, and an older woman seemed to scream the name of Charles, but names didn’t matter now. 
With a hysterical scream that ripped one of her vocal cords, she opened her eyes wide and experienced an Orgasm.
Her loins began thrusting forward, blood and snot began to tickle from her nose and she bit hard on the barrel of the gun.

Her body began to twitch in a slowing rhythm and with the final thrust of her loins, she hardened all her muscles in her left arm, took a firm grip on the gun and pulled the trigger.

They took different paths, too.

My life has become one sick paradox

At night, fall asleep in that shitty basement apartment.

By day, awake in that world of white. 

White walls.

White clothes.

White sheets.

White noise.

The brilliant blue of sky is my saving grace. My final solace. It grants me a taste of something new, something refreshing against this bland backdrop.

In one world, I am tormented by invisible foes, ones that I can not evade from no matter how hard I try.

In the other, I am a prisoner to my own subconscious. I can only see; and all I see is fucking white. I can't run. I can't hide.

Take your medicine.

Accept the treatment.

Nothing is really the same, rational world that you prepared to live in.

Everything they taught you in science class becomes null and void once that plane of reality has been breached.

Evolution?

The Big Bang?

Fuck all that. That noise is for the birds.

And in this winter wonderland, my only company are the voices inside my head. Not the evil ones, not the ones that hurt me.

No.

These voices are my own. My past. My present. My future.

I am reliving my life as if it were playing out on a projector before my very eyes. Right in that room of seclusion, I remember a past of reckless abandon.


I was eight years old. The great figure that was Christ loomed above me in his bloody and grotesque slendor, nailed up there on that piece of 2x4. He gave me comfort, although I can not say why.

The man at the alter was a man of the Cloth. Tall. Whithered. Aged. Reassuring. He stood before his congregation, preaching love, peace, of death. Pious things.

The coffin was of dark mahogany, flawlessly crafted, and it shined in the dim lighting of the church. I attended weekend services with my mother in this very church.

My mother was kind. Always faithful. Always sincere. She should have been there by my side, to comfort me in my most desperate hour. But instead, there she rested, in the depths of that wooden box.

How did that old saying go? As I walked through the shadow of the valley of death, I shall fear no evil? 

Yeah. Fear no evil.


I punched and punched some more. I swung until the feeling in my arms ceased. I swung until the muscles in my body ached. I screamed until my throat was raw. 

I was thirteen. That was when the doctors came to visit.


I was seventeen.
I had been enrolled in five different schools. I had eaten in five different cafeterias. I rode five different busses to school. It was a world of doubles and more repeats. Nothing was constant.

I made no friends.

Weirdo! Freak!

They called me nasty things. Horrible things.

At first, the voices didn't hurt me. They approached me and soothed my broken heart. They were my friends.


I was eighteen. I got the fuck out of dodge. 
No doctors.
No assholes.
No worries.
I traveled to New York City.
It was in that city where I met my first real, genuine friend. My first love. Emily.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1ib7rb,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1ib7rb/feedback_the_rabbit_hole_pt_vi/,

The people she knocked tutted and muttered under their breaths but she didn’t care; the President was coming.

She finally burst through the front of the throng and straight into a huge soldier. He was dressed from head to toe in black armour. Her hand touched the cold metal of his lowered rifle and she snatched it away, but he glared and shoved her back.

She shrank back to the line and then spotted what the soldiers were so angry about. In the middle of the street a normal sized man stood between two soldiers. He looked comically tiny next to them but her smile fell when she saw the blood on his face. The soldiers forced him to his knees and a shadow of weary resignation clouded his fierce expression.

She couldn’t understand it; if he was a criminal why weren’t they taking him to prison? People had said the President was coming.

Her heart skipped a beat in delight when she saw the huge black limousine sliding through the parted crowd. She tried to hold back her grin, she had to be respectful, but the stories told of his benevolent smile, his towering presence as he gazed lovingly on his grateful subjects, spreading his wisdom and guidance.

He must have been here to grant the criminal forgiveness, they always said he was merciful.

“Hey sweetie, where’s your mother?” the woman stood next to her said. “You should go find her; you don’t want to see this.”

“But the President’s here!” Lucy smiled up at her, why wouldn’t she want to see him?

The woman frowned but disappeared through the sea of people.

The door of the limousine opened and she held her breath. Would he notice her? Her dad was always talking about him.

He stepped out. His shiny shoes, his perfect suit and his pale hair were just as she had seen on TV and on the posters. But his smile wasn’t benevolent at all. 

It was the grin of a predator. 

He strode across the filthy concrete towards the kneeling man and the prisoner glared back.

“I have done nothing wrong. All I wanted was democracy!” the man on his knees shouted. “You are a tyrant and the people will rise against you.”

“Rise?” the President sneered, she could barely hear him. “Look around you. They’re not going to rise.” 

The man looked, desperately. “This man lets you starve! He keeps you living in fear and sends our children to fight against an Empire of justice,” he shouted, but his voice cracked. “He cares nothing for your suffering.”

The President drew his pistol, cocked it, and Lucy’s stomach plummeted; this wasn’t merciful.

“No!” she screamed and tried to dart forwards. Her mother grabbed her wrist and dragged her back, wrapping her arms around her as the gunshot rang out.

She was lifted up and carried away but she still saw the prisoner. He was slumped on the concrete, a dark puddle spreading beneath his head. His lifeless eyes stared straight into hers.

------

Now, ten years later, no one was holding her back. 

The soldier was three times her weight, a foot taller and heavily armoured. Her only advantage was surprise and she used it well.

Lucy stamped hard into the side of his knee as he raised his pistol to execute the prisoner. The soldier fell with a roar of pain and she rammed her elbow up into his jaw, the only unprotected part of his head. There was no grace to her movements, no elegant twirls or flourishes. She knew only to cause as much damage as possible before they had the chance to tear her apart.

The other soldier snapped his rifle sights onto her, finger already on the trigger. The prisoner charged, ramming into the soldier’s midsection and making him stagger back with an animalistic grunt. The prisoner sprang back and landed a solid kick in the soldier’s groin before Lucy dragged him away into the huddled crowd of onlookers. 
There they lowered their head and slowed their pace. The Commoners closed in around them as if they hadn’t even noticed and let them blend in instantly.

“What the hell is wrong with you, Charlie?” Lucy said, drawing a knife and cutting his bound hands free. He was trembling hard. 

“They must have gotten my picture from somewhere...” he said as she led him into the dark chasm between two towers blocks, away from the prying eyes of the police and patriots. “They must have set up a deal or something.” 

“They never come here! Now this place is going to be crawling with them. You’re not the only one who has to worry about being recognised,” she snapped, leading him deeper into the maze of darkness and grime. The ground was thick with rubbish; in the summer the narrow filthy alleyways created a stinking oven of rotting waste, but now it was almost frozen.

He rapidly composed himself. “You and your team of free-love hippies,” he said. “Didn’t you see how that scum behaved? Standing around like gormless sheep as I was about to get my head blown off.”

“This is the thanks I get for saving your life Charlie?” They had argued about this before. 

“You’ve seen what I’ve seen a hundred times,” he said and let her hold open a gap in a chain-link fence that was strung between two towers. “What’s the point of trying to help Commoners when all they care about is getting their next meal?”

“Because right now all there is to care about is survival,” Lucy said. “It's not like you're any better.""

“How dare you? I fight the government, I work for freedom,” he snarled as they started walking again. “They do what the boss tells them, they get their rations and they do it every bloody day without a single thought in their thick heads.”

“You don’t fight, you sell drugs,” Lucy said. “You do exactly what the Commoners are doing, just underground and for a different boss. The only difference is that you’re not on a register.”

He glared. “Why did you save me then? What good did it do you?”

She rolled her eyes. “Not everything I do is planned,” she said. 

The fight was still sinking in, she could have died or been captured and only now was she starting to comprehend the risk that she had taken, but after years of fighting risk had became mundane and the trembling exhilaration now made her feel almost human.

“Well... Thanks,” he said, stopping and making her come to a halt. “I owe you.”

“You already owed me, you know any train drivers?”

Sam entered his cubicle without knocking. 

""Hey Mike, me and-""

*How obnoxious,* Mike thought, trying not to make his distaste too evident.

""Hey,"" he said, reluctantly turning away from his computer.  
""-some other lads were planning on hitting the pub after work.""  
""Sounds good,"" he said absent mindedly.  
""Get to know each other a bit, y' know. You wanna tag along?"" Sam asked, in his annoying overly-friendly tone.   
""I would love to but-""  
Sam cut him off before he could finish. ""C'mon, it'll be a blast!"" he said cheerfully.

Mike hesitated for a bit. He decided it won't be easy to dissuade Sam

*As long as he gets out of my hair.*

""Alright then.""  
""We'll be leaving in a few.""  
""I still do have to finish a bit of work,"" he said, pointing at his suitably messy desk. ""You guys go ahead. I'll catch up later,"" he said re-assuringly.

A shadow of doubt crossed Sam's face and Mike half expected him to start protesting. However, he didn't.

""Oh, that's fine. Catch ya later,"" Sam said, leaving as unceremoniously as he had entered.

Mike heaved a sigh of relief.

*What a pain in the ass.*

The phone rang. He glanced at the screen and didn't recognise the number. He decided to ignore it.

The phone rang again. The same number flashed across the screen.

*Maybe it's something important?*   

""Hello?""  
""Am I speaking to Mr. Mike Smithers?""  
""Uh, yeah.""  
""I am calling from the Greenwich County hospital. Your parents were involved in a road accident,"" he said.  
""And?"" Mike asked, suspecting that he already knew the answer.

There was a slight pause.

*Probably gathering his courage*, Mike thought.

""They passed away today, at eight o'clock.""  
""I see.""  
""I'm sorry for your loss.""  
""Me too,"" Mike said hesitantly, unsure of what to say.

The man on the other end waited, as if expecting him to say something.

*Maybe he expects me to break down into tears?*  

""So, um, I'll catch the first flight tomorrow, around..."" he said, glancing at his watch. ""...seven in the morning..?""

He hung up the phone, not waiting for a response.

*At least I don't have to go to the pub now.*

He hastily scribbled down an application for leave and handed it to the manager who was most understanding, gave his condolences and then went off on a bit of a tangent -- as he often did -- on the unfairness and cruelty of the universe. Mike nodded along sympathetically and when the chance presented itself, slipped away; leaving the manager rambling to himself.

Outside, it was raining heavily.

*Pat pat pat.*

*The rain feels cleansing.*

He smiled to himself, the kind of smile you have on your face when being amused by a joke only you understand.

*Who am I kidding? It's the same every time. Cold, wet and miserable.*


He hailed a cab. He fell into an uneasy sleep. Vague nightmares haunted him.
The cab jolted to a stop, snapping him out of his uneasy dozing. He paid the fare and started walking towards his home.

*Pat Pat Pat.*

The first thing he did when he reached home was undress himself. Unfastening each button was a struggle. He fumbled and floundered. By the time he was done, his hands were numb and the muscles felt even more sore.  He dragged his feet into the bathroom for a hot shower.

*I still have to book the tickets. Did the news come today...or was it yesterday?*

It didn't matter.

He just lay there, motionless. The warm water felt comforting.

*How long have I been here? Did I doze off?*

He sighed and forced himself to get up. He wiped off the foggy mirror. A stranger stared back at him. A gaunt faced stranger with sunken eyes. Well developed smiles lines suggested of a man that had once laughed freely but for now, it betrayed no emotion. An unremarkable face that would easily blend into the thousands of people you come across everyday. 

*The perfect mask.*

An involuntary sigh escaped his lips.

*It has been so long. Is there even a real person behind this mask?*

He wondered, as he often did.

*Perhaps, it's time you found out,* the voices said. 

*How?*  

*Oh, but you already know the answer, don't you?* the reply came back, taunting him.

He nodded to himself. He knew what he had to do. He had known it for the longest time.

He reached into the drawer and pulled out the gun.

*Now that there is nothing stopping me...*

He ran his fingers along the smooth, cold metal.

*Finally.*

He cocked the gun and pulled the trigger.

The man they called Bearkiller said something in a deep, gutteral voice that made it hard to understand. He had a beard of course black hair so thick his mouth was nearly hidden. All Paul glimpsed was a flash of bright, white teeth.

“My Knight,” Lord Mossfield said in his high, nasal voice, “Keeps fairer law here than Lord Halloway. By right of force, I say begone, boy.” He giggled then and coughed so hideously that brown flecked snot and drool flung from the frog lord and Paul had to turn away to avoid being struck by it. Anger began to override his fear, yet the sight of Bearkiller stayed his sword hand. He swallowed and glanced to his uncle, but the older man simply stared at the fat lord with disdain. *If I back down now I am a coward and father will disown me. The Nobility has no need of cowards.*

He shifted his gaze away from Bearkiller to Lord Mossfield and back again. The Bearkiller was smiling at him, white teeth showing in that dark beard. The hammer he was holding tapped deftly against his chest. Then Bearkiller spoke. “I grab you and break you like worm boy.”

“Joss,” Lord Mossfield said, raising his hand again and a man in green enameled armor rode to him, sword unsheathed and laid across his pommel. “You and Bearkiller push these trespassers off our land.”

Paul hesitated, watching the green armored man move forward and pull his sword off his saddle. Others moved then too, first the Mossfields and then his own men.Lances dipped, swords drew and challenges were yelled. He found his own sword in his hand, his shield hefted to guard his right side. Rock pranced, shaking his head, ready to fight.

Bearkiller was yelling something but a buzz of noise erupted all around him. Men were calling to him. Lord Mossfield was laughing. Be brave, be your father’s son! His uncle Loukas grabbed for his arm but it was too late.

His sword took the fat lord in the face, slicing clean through the bridge of his nose. A great gash appeared where the sword bit, sending shards of bone and a spray of blood shooting into the air. Mossfield screamed, a high pitched wail that was almost a sob. Bearkiller roared and reached for him but Rock reared, causing the Bearkiller to stumble and sprawl in the dirt. In that same instant, Paul lost his seat and tumbled off Rock’s back.

“Paulin!” his uncle’s voice called out and Paul saw his hand reach down for him. An arrow took his uncle in the throat and when Loukas opened his mouth to speak, blood poured out like a red river. Paul scrambled away as his uncle’s body toppled to the ground with a crash of metal armor and blood. For a moment, Paul was frozen with disbelief. Over him, Rock reared and kicked, sending Mossfield men sprawling, chests and faces caved in. Paul felt his fingers brush something hard and cold—his sword he realized—and he picked it up. Standing, Paul tried to climb back onto Rock but the battle forced him away and he fell back into the dirt.

All around him chaos was erupting. Mossfield and Halloway men clashed and the Thunder Company charged in, their horses’ hooves shaking the ground. Paul found his knees and nearly had his head taken off by a flashing sword. His opponent, a man in boiled leather and a simple mail coif, swung at him again. This time, Paul managed to bring his shield up. As the blade rang off the wood, he felt a warmth spread down his leg. Fear gripped him so tightly that he couldn’t move, only stare down at his bloodless legs.

His heart had emptied and so had his bladder.

The man came at him again but a horse came between them. Atop his brown charger, Jack hacked at the man with his own sword. A moment later and his squire disappeared from view as the battle swirled around him. Shivering, Paul covered his head with shield and sword and cowered there in the road as horses and men fought around him.

Something grabbed his shield and yanked him roughly to his feet. When he looked up, Bearkiller stood there with hammer in hand, grinning through that impossibly thick beard. “I crush you raven,” the giant of a man said. “Make your death and drink your blood, like the Witch Queen.” Then he dipped back his head and roared with laughter.

Paul stepped back, his sword shaking in his hand. His shield felt like it was made of iron and too heavy to lift. The armor on his shoulders was pushing him to his knees and his bladder felt ready to burst again. “Raise sword!” the giant commanded and raised his big hammer. “Raise it like man!” Paul raised his sword and tried to bring his shield up but they both felt chained to the ground by invisible restraints. The Bearkiller’s blow came down on him slowly. It seemed almost like a turning of the seasons to Paul, each moment of the arc that would end his life coming so impossibly slow. Somehow he found the strength to raise his shield an instant before the hammer smashed into his head.

The shield exploded from the impact, sending shards of wood everywhere. Paul screamed as the hammer’s blow cracked something in his arm and splinters peppered his forearm and bicep. The pain was impossible to bear. He dropped his sword and held his wounded arm against his chest, tears streaking down his face as much from fear as the pain. “Pick up sword, weak boy!” the Bearkiller shouted.

Instead, Paul ran.

He heard the Bearkiller calling his name but he didn’t look back. He ran between horses rearing, men battling and pushing and dying. His feet carried him to the end of the Halloway line and broke into the short open field before the forest. Arrows whizzed past him and it only urged him on faster, into the woodlands.

After, Paul wasn’t sure how long he ran or how far but by the time the pain in his arm caused him to slow, his legs had all but given out. He fell into a hedge where the trees were thick and bushes thicker. There were no sounds of metal on metal or the buzz of arrows. The fight was far behind him.

He crawled beneath the thickest bush he could find. He was so tired that it took all that was left of his energy to curl up beneath it. The sun was shining through the canopy above. He heard birds chirping. A bloody spring, he thought just before he fell asleep.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1hjn1s,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1hjn1s/feedback_hallow_hill_part_3_continuation_of_my/,

I'm working through character descriptions for an action/suspense novel that I have plotted out, and I was interested to get some thoughts on the use of aptronyms. For instance, my antagonist's working name is Malcolm Verrat. Malcolm, being the one who slayed Macbeth and ""Verrat"" meaning ""treason"" in German. While laying in bed last night I realized that Malcolm may not be as a subtle as I had first thought, due to the root word ""mal"" meaning ""bad"" or ""evil."" 

So, my question is, how subtle should aptronyms be when used, in your opinion? Should I assume that my reader has a basic understanding of root words and exclude something like Malcolm in this case? Or, even if I do make the same assumption, include it because they will appreciate it? Or, finally, should aptronyms be far more subtle than this, such as ""Verrat?""

Mrs. Harris pinches my American History exam by a corner, the bloody rag. Section two, The Civil War, question thirteen. The answer is C, eleven states seceded. Question fourteen is B, 1862 and 22,717 are dead in Antietam. Fifteen is C again. Bad dad cab dab.

“Your grades are good,” Mrs. Harris says to me. She nods her head and leans in, trying to see what’s under the hood. “So that’s good. It’s important.” She scans my records again, safely slipped inside of a plastic sheet, away from my nose and my brain blood.

“Your grades are better than good. They’re perfect. You’ll graduate with honors.” She looks over to the blood-soaked History exam. “But they’re not even gonna let you rehearse if you keep getting yourself into trouble like this.”

“If you need help

If you need help, or someone to talk to, therapy is

Just try to keep your fists out of your fellow student’s faces.” Mrs. Harris says with guilt in her grin. “Just for another five months. Then you’re out of here. And you can go anywhere.”

Mrs. Harris sits back in her chair and lets out a long, frustrated breath. “If you could go back and do it all again,” she says. “What would you do different?”

I think on it for a minute. From under my hood I say, “I would have asked for one of those candies on the desk when I walked in. One of them blue mints.”

Mrs. Harris drops her head as I suck on a mint. “You did ask for one.”

You blink and it’s over.

“Look,” Mrs. Harris goes. “High school is tough. But there aren’t any do-overs. So make this count.”

Blink.

“High school”

I thank him a thousand times in-between cursing my lighter for being a fickly son of a bitch. I hold the cold cubes against the cut on the back of my head while Samuel pulls up a seat next to the couch. 

“Careful with that, it’s a family heirloom you know.”

“I had no clue you belonged to the army family of Salvation.” 

He thinks he’s funny, I humor him with a laugh, but I cough. It hurts, and leaves red little specks painted across my palm. I pull another long smooth drag while he continues his inquiry. 

“So what was all that noise last night, I figured you’d won the lottery of something!”

Oh, Samuel, you fool. My cigarette, hardly even that, had gone out. I dig for another.

“She left me, finally,” I answer him, pulling out half a bent Turk. Samuel raises an eyebrow, he doesn’t understand. Through gritted teeth and a deep inhale I fill in for him, “Some jackpot, huh?”

“But the music, the lights, the danc--”

“I didn’t want anyone to hear me cry. And as far as you’re concerned I didn’t just say that. And, well, I’d never hit a lady, but thank god apartments are unisex.” I take another drag and point the smoldering ember towards the wall behind him, a nice fresh fist hole dead center. 

“Hey, waitaminute, I thought she’d left you last month anyway.” 

Samuel never ceases to unknowingly make matters worst. I take a stand, cringing ever so slightly. Still glass in my foot, oh well. ",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1ei67d,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1ei67d/decided_to_do_min_500_words_a_day_heres_what_i/,

Anyway, here is the synopsis: A man (we'll call him Grady for now)  is awakened one night by his wife's scream. He goes to the living room looking for her and find her tied to a chair with two men standing over her. He is then himself restrained. Through the standard bad guy rant (Grady) finds out that he is going to be a part of an experiment. They (the bad guys) want to see if they can turn a good guy into a killer through drugging and torture. They proceed to torture (Grady's) wife in front of him, record it and then play it on loop on the TV as they proceed to torture and drug (Grady). Eventually they decide enough is enough, take him from his house and dump him in the streets where he is found and taken to a hospital. There he meets a detective (who may be an alternate POV through out the story) who takes on finding who did this to him. (Grady) is soon given a clean bill of health and released from the hospital and is taken home. Soon after he realizes that something in his mind has changed and he begins to have rage problems and urges to kill. So he does and after his first kill her is tortured with guilt but his urge was relieved. As the urges return over and over again he tries to curve the cravings with other things like prostitutes, hard drugs, alcohol, and eventually rape but none of them completely satisfy the urges so he always resorts to killing. After his third or fourth kill he decides that he will fight the urges that are building up inside of him and direct his anger towards those who did this to him and is on a mission to find them before the detective. 

Here's where my problem comes in: How does (Grady) find out who these guys are? I had an idea that one of them would either be constantly handling a sobriety coin while at the house or wearing one around his neck. And so (Grady) would go and sit in on AA and durg addiction meetings until he finds him. But the problem with that is that 1. The guys will be wearing masks so he'll never see there faces so he won't know what they look like 2. I plan on the setting being a big city and I imagine that there are possibly hundreds if not thousands of AA and drug recovery meetings so it's not really practical for him to go to all of these meetings.  

So any ideas, opinions and feedback on the synopsis would be much appreciated. Thank you.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1b98it,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1b98it/need_a_little_plot_help/,

“Gravedigger, come dig my grave for me,” I whispered as I held the razor blade over my wrist. 
	
This wouldn’t be the first time cold metal would pierce my skin. The smell of copper would soon fill the room and I would become light-headed. It was what I wanted. I wanted the escape - to journey closer to the edge. I wasn’t sure yet if I wanted to cross over but each time I went closer the better I felt when I came back. Such a strange thing life is. Here on the edge I get just a taste of what else is out there. 
	
I tried explaining it to my psychologist but he just shook his head and sent me to a physiatrist. The bevy of pills that man tried to dose me with was ridiculous.  As he was listing the issues I had to my mother I couldn’t help but sing it Greased Lighting style.  Why this girl is automatic, systematic, hydromatic. Why, she’s Schizophrenic. 
	
Right. I was the one who was schizophrenic. It wasn’t my fault he wasn’t able to see what I could. If a physicist proved that there were other dimensions surrounding us, I doubt he would be locked away and told he was crazy. But alas I am no genius who can do insane math problems in my head, so I must be the crazy one. My last journey was enough to prove that I wasn’t crazy.

I met a man with a scar that ran from his left temple across his face to his right side of his chin. My mother would have ran from him. I couldn’t help but approach him and wonder why he was staring at the wall so intently. His weak smile made my heart pause for a moment. He couldn’t grab ahold of the flaking wall and his spirit faded with each motion he made. Help me, he mouthed and I nodded. 
	
“What’s your name?” My voice sounded almost musical in this dimension.
	
“Francis Grace.”  It wasn’t hard to see that speaking caused such great pain to the man.  “Can you bring it to my mother?”
	
“Where does she live?” I wasn’t going to ask him what it was, there was no need. I knew that once I woke up I had to escape from this prison and find that wall. 
	
There was nothing worse than waking up to the bright lights of the emergency room.  Maybe if the people on this side understood how confusing it is to find your way back home they would keep it dark. Bright lights belong to the other side while darkness belongs here. I’m not sure how many times I have tried to explain it to the nurse but they always just shake their heads and walk away. They didn’t understand that they were representing the darkness with their actions.
	
“Ms. Carry please be still.” Nurse Janice had no patience today for me. She’s seen me dozen times since I was thirteen. 
	
“No time for this nonsense, I have to go.” I yanked the IV from my hand. Janice knew better.
	
“Emily, don’t make me dope you.” Janice was already making her way to the call button. 
	
This couldn’t happen today. I had to help Mr. Grace. He needed his soul to rest and I knew where the wall was. I had seen it before and it wasn’t too far from here. But before I could throw my limp legs over the edge of the bed an orderly had me pinned down while Janice pumped me with a new cocktail to help me rest. 
	
My foot itched from the blanket covering it. Whatever they filled me with wasn’t doing the trick. Instead of drifting off to a lovely catatonic state my skin felt as if thousands of ant were slowly creeping across it. I knew if I were to struggle in my restraints they would come back, but I really wanted to scratch my foot.
	
The halls of the hospital were quiet. It must have been late, but I couldn't tell you since I was kept in a windowless room. They seemed to think if I were to have a window I would jump to my death. I’m not sure why they thought I was suicidal. I’m not suicidal, nor have I ever attempted suicide. What I was doing wasn’t to meet death, I was just crossing over. Besides I’ve met death that several times while I was quite alive. 
	
The room suddenly went cold. I looked around for what spirit had come to visit. I couldn’t see anyone, but I knew they had come for me when my wrist loosened and the locked door swung open. The spirit must have been Mr. Grace, since I had promised to help him. It was nice that he was returning the favor. Then again I wasn’t of much use to him strapped down to the bed. 

Faster than I should have moved I threw my hoodie on over my head and slipped into the jeans my mom had brought me. The room spun in a lopsided circle but I wasn’t going to let that stop me from finding that wall. 

The wind whipped around my face. I didn’t have any money to call a cab, so my only options to walk. The wall was ten miles north of the hospital. The one good thing about living in a small town is you know where everything was without even having to think about it. The white flaky wall was in an abandoned church yard that I used to play in as a child. I remember that on every Sunday spirits would show up for the services. I would wonder if they knew that the building only had half a roof and a missing wall. The ghost pastor didn’t seem to notice one bit. 

The sun broke through the fog as I entered the overgrown church yard. A few birds chirped from the tree just outside the gate. The wildflowers were taking over the walkway which shimmered in the morning dew. Each barefooted step I made was carefully placed not to step on a single one. The flowers looked as though they breathed sigh of relief as I passed them unharmed. Francis Grace stood at the doorway waiting for me. The pain on his face was no longer there. 

“Thank you,” I whispered as I passed him. 

The wooden pews had been beaten by years of being exposed to rain and snow. There were still bibles scattered along the floor and above the altar was a beautiful stained glass dove. It was so peaceful to look at. The morning sun made it glow so bright that it crept into my bones washing away the cold that gripped me so tightly. 

Mr. Grace paced along the west wall. I didn’t know what I was looking for but he let me know this was the wall. A small crack in the plaster made it easy for my fingers to grip and pull it apart. For how damaged the wall looked, prying it apart was proving to be more difficult than I thought. 

The sun reached high noon before I pulled enough plaster away. Dust from the wall covered my body and made it hard to see. Not to mention I was on my tiptoes peering into a dark hole in the wall. A rickety chair was nearby. I grabbed it and prayed it would support me. In two unsure steps I was up peering into the dusty space. Off to the left I saw something and twisted my arm in ignoring the sharp pain tearing at my wrist and there it was. A small blue box. 

“You found it.” Francis’ eyes started to water.

It was strange to watch a man with such a terrifying face, one that would send most people running, break down and sob. He was just as vulnerable as me. I wanted nothing more than give him a hug, but I wasn’t on his side. I couldn’t touch him. 

“Where does she live?” I asked, hoping it would be close enough for me to walk to. 

Francis grabbed hold of my hand and we were no longer in the church. An unexpected serenity came over as he held onto me tightly. I always thought I would be scared if one of the ghosts finally touched me, but there was nothing scary about this. Where Francis had taken us was hot. I felt like I wanted to melt. The only protection from the intense heat was the cool draft radiating from Francis. His hand felt cold wrapped around my fingers. There was a woman in her sixties knelt down in the garden pruning roses.

“Mrs. Grace?” I inquired.

She jumped and accidentally snipped one of her fingers. “Yes?”

I held out the blue box. “Your son wanted you to have this.” 

Her hands shook as she took it from me. Inside the box was a pearl necklace with a small emerald hanging from it. “How did you get this?”

I didn’t expect her to sound angry. “Francis had me bring it to you. I’m sorry for your loss.”

“Thank you.” She could barely get out the whisper.

I would love the feedback.",TheGuruofWar,10,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/118zri/prelude_for_my_ninja_novel_set_in_a_futuristic/,"In the growth of political instability around the globe, Japan had slowly, but gradually, returned to its feudal traditions of the old class system, initiating the *Second Sengoku Period*. After much infighting, the country was conquered under the banner of the Imperial Family. For more than a decade of rule, the people suffered from high taxes, strict laws and the selfish taking of resources. Thousands died from famine. However, heirs to the *Tokugawa shogun bloodline* and their samurai supporters rebelled and overthrew the Emperor, and were immediately put into power, which would be later named the *Tokugawa Reclamation*.

Support from the people for the regime began to grow, in the hope that the Tokugawa would save them from the misery that had been brought upon by the previous government. The high taxes were cut down and some of the laws became more lenient, but this left a major element in Japan's criminal underground left unchecked. The *yakuza* began to emerge as a major political power in feudal society, gaining control over major parts of the country through fear and harassment. In fear that the country would slip into another civil war, many people pleaded with the *shogun* , that with the help of his *daimyo*, suppress the *yakuza* before they had a chance to disrupt the peace. The Tokugawa began a massive and well-coordinated manhunt for the gangs, severing their connections with international support and forcing them back underground. The people, in rejoice, offered the government what crops and resources they had as a sign of gratitude for their ability to act swiftly in the defense of the people. And so every year, a major ceremony in which the people donate rice, fish and others is held in Tokyo, where the *shogun* resides.

Many years on, Japan is still in peace under the Reclamation. But tension between the *daimyo* has begun to mount, with some beginning to question Tokugawa's methods and legitimacy to rule, speculating a conspiracy behind it, while many others strongly supported the regime. The dispute has led to some open confrontation, but with the people sick and tired of decades of war, the confrontations became more clandestine, in fear of losing public support in their respected regions. This gave the *yakuza* an opportunity to strike back against the government, who was caught up in the infighting. This begins a series of secret conflicts between the warlords and clans known the *Kage-Sensou Period (影戦争, Shadow Wars)*, for which demanded the special skills of many mercenaries, hitmen and *ronin.* It also marked the return of some of history's most notorious sabotuers, assassins and spies: ***the ninja.***

The boat was doomed the moment the Siren parted his lips. Like a child hypnotized by promises of sweets, it had followed the music without question. No one else seemed to hear his song, but that only made his honeyed call more alluring. Shamelessly, the craft left its harbor home, too quickly to stop for a map. Out on the sea, his seductive song was everywhere; crashing through waves, radiating from the sun, and soaking through the air. His delicious music pulled the boat further and further as the continent the boat once loved faded into the distance, too fast for any captain. Islands disappeared, along with the gulls and fish, until even the air and water had been replaced by the harmony. After minutes that stretched like years, the boat saw him for the first time, on a solitary circle of sparkling sand. The boat was drawn forward in earnest now, sail filled with his song. The Siren's golden gaze seemed to pierce through the heart of the vessel, and it knew the Siren wanted it there close to him, to sing for this boat alone. His ethereal voice pulled at the wooden frame irresistibly, and nothing else existed in the world.

Maybe if the boat had seen the rocks lurking around the sand bar, it could have saved itself. Maybe if the boat had seen the ship behind its stern, it would have realized its mistake. Heedlessly, the jumble of wood cut through the water to race to the Siren’s side. A heartbeat from landfall, the water cut back. Rocks bashed the bow, wrenching nail from plank while boards buckled, contorted, and gnashed at each other. Timber shrieked as it tore apart and splintered into the sea beneath it. Water, heated from the friction, boiled up and dissolved the mast and diluted the blood that poured across the boat’s ruined deck, filling the air with its metallic stench. The Siren’s song still permeated the air, but could not drown the wails of destruction and despair from the pitiful raft. The boat scanned the sand for the Siren, and found his eyes. The Siren had never truly seen the boat, but only looked through it to the ship behind, accidentally enticing poor vessel forward. Destroyed by its own naivety, the pile of ruined kindling collapsed into a watery grave upon the rock, so close to its destination, but forever barred. The surge scattered its maimed carcass about the seafloor as the trailing ship made landfall. 


Even after all this, I still can’t regret my decision to follow my Siren. My misery is a fair price to hear his song. He’s crooned for so long now, but sometimes he pauses to draw breath. In these moments, in the utter silence, I see everything clearly. I see that I could block my ears, pry the rock from my pierced sides, gather my frame, rebuild my mast and drain the saltwater from my belly. I could turn back, sail in blurred loops until I fumbled my way home, dejected but free. I could be whole again, but then the song continues and I am entranced once more. For eternity, I’ll remain this mangled wooden corpse, bloodied boards scraping the rocks below, while passing fish nibble at my rotting flesh, and hope that his eyes turn on me. Until then, I’ll listen to the song he sings for someone else.

Derek Yu pulled his hood over his head in an attempt to guard against the chill coming in off the lake. It was late September, but winter was already tightening its grip around the city. Talk was that it was supposed to one of the coldest winters on record. Yu believed it, but it didn't worry him. He'd survived midwest winters before, he was sure the coming one would be no different. 
	He stepped off the street, on to the curb, and in to a Chinese place with a busted neon sign in the window advertising ""The Best Lo Mein in Chicago"", in English. Almost all of the signs down in chinatown were in Mandarin, but this one was close to the neighborhood's edge, and most of its customers were lost Americans or local tourists who only spoke english. The resturant had a low ceiling, with painfully bright flourescent lights bolted in to it. The tile floor was cracked and worn, and most of the tables had their chairs set on top of them for the night. It was three in the morning, and Derek had felt a gnawing hunger growing in his stomach for the last few hours on the bus. 
	There was only one other customer in the place, sitting at the third table from the enterance and hunched over his orange chicken. The man at the counter shot a quick greeting in Mandarin at him, and Yu responded in kind. He didn't speak his native language very well anymore, in fact he had forgotten most of it except for a few scarce phrases and greetings. The employee noticed his broken pronounciation and quickly switched to English with a nearly flawless midwestern accent.
	""What are you having tonight, sir?""

""Is your Lo Mein really as good as the sign says?""

""It's the best in Chicago"" The employee said. He sounded like he didn't believe it.

""Sounds good enough for me. What's there to drink here?""

""Water, booze, tea...""

Derek stopped him before he could finish his list.

""I'll just have water, thanks""

""Lo Mein and water"" The employee sketched the order down on a notepad, ""coming right up""

Yu chose a seat by the window and stared out in to the street. A dog barked somewhere off in the distance, cop cars sounded their alarms. There was a small light in the apartment across the street, and Yu could see an older man smoking a pipe and staring out in to the street. They made eye contact for a brief second. Yu nodded at him, the man nodded back. He bent down to his backpack, which was seated under the table, and took out a brochure that he had received a week earlier. Choosing your path, a guide to your life with mechanical augmentations. Yu reached down and felt the empty space where his left arm used to be. It still bothered him, knowing that a piece of his body was never coming back. 
	50,000 workers on that vert farm and I'm the dumbass who has to get it. He thought to himself. He had retraced the day it happened countless times in the last week. Four-thirty am, alarm goes off. At work by six, inside my department and checking the machines by six-thirty. Everything goes according to plan until ten fifty-seven. Arm gets caught in a corn thresher, black out, wake up the next day. Arm's gone, doctors are telling me I'm lucky to be alive but I'll never get the arm back.
	He couldn't believe that he had let his guard down that much. The higher-ups always told horror stories like that to the newbies to scare them straight, but Yu had always assumed that he was careful enough to avoid an accident like that. When he finally came to in that hospital, the regional manager was waiting to offer his ""sincere apologies"", and promised that the company would pay for any augmentation that was necessary to get him working again. That sounded great, until they handed him a list of doctors approved by the company's insurance. It was a very short list.
	Stephen Goulianos-Chicago
That was it. No approved doctors in Iowa, none in Missouri either, which was only an hour's drive from where he worked. He had to go all the way to Chicago to get an augmentation, or he would live the rest of his life as an amputee. It was a six hour bus ride, and he would have to stay at least a week for the physical therapy after the operation. It was a pain, but he would be unable to continue working unless he took the time off.
	By the time his food got to his table, the gnawing hunger had turned in to a thrashing, ravenous sensation. He realized that he hadn't eaten the entire day, and wolfed down the noodles as soon as the waiter left the table. Once he had eaten his fill, he started flipping through the brochure. There was the standard preamble about how it was such a ""hard decision"" and the psychological affects affects of augmentation couldn't be ignored. Yu didn't really care as long as he could work, and turned to the last section that listed the different models of mechanical arms he could choose from. They all looked pretty similar except for the colors they came in. Some were more specialized for certain work like construction or IT, some didn't even look like regular arms, others had the exact flesh tone of the real thing. Yu decided then and there that he didn't want his arm to look like the one he lost. If he was going to be part machine from now on, he was going to be proud of it. He picked the standard civilian model in black and made up his mind to tell Goulianos he wanted that one. 
	Having made up his mind and satisfied his hunger, Yu felt a little better about the upcoming procedure. He left the resturant, got his bearings, and headed in the direction of the hotel he was staying in for the night. It was situated on the corner of West 24th Place and South Princeton Avenue, overlooking Sun-Yet-Sen park. It was a recent development, constructed in 2023 to bring in more revenue to that part of the city. Chinatown was notorious for its lack of sleeping arrangements for people who were just passing through, and the city council wanted to improve the neighborhood's appeal to tourists. 
	The contract had been given to the Wudi Construction Company after a fierce bidding war. Construction had been quick and a few regulations had been overlooked by the city government to ensure the process went smoothly. A few corners cut here, one or two missing permits there, nothing big, and certainly nothing that the mayor needed to know about.
	Yu walked a few blocks south to West 24th Place, then turned west and continued for about a half mile before coming to the hotel. It was a massive, bland building on the outside. Plenty of concrete and steel, not many windows or outside features to catch people's eyes as they strolled past. It was build with function, not form, in mind, much like the rest of the city. Yu's back ached from his six hour bus ride, and the walk had done little to alleviate the pain. He needed to lie down and rest up, he had an eight o'clock appointment with Goulianos tomorrow.
	He stepped inside and the buidling took on a radically different feeling. The hotel was hollow, with a massive central atrium surrounded by eight walls of capsule rooms rising twenty stories high. From his vantage point on the ground floor, Yu could see all the way up to a skylight at the top of the building. If he squinted, he could see the outlines of people inside their tiny, one-man rooms. People watching movies on their computers, people reading, people sleeping. Privacy was not a concern here, there was none to be found. If you wanted a cheap place to stay for a while, you came here.
The atrium had a water feature in the center, and a few sad plants lined the walls like criminals waiting for their mug shots. A few carts had been set up as well. They were selling cigarettes and watery beer for those desperate enough to buy, Yu declined their offers. It was about four in the morning now, and he seriously contemplated staying up the whole night. Three hours of sleep didn't seem worth it to him, but it was better than nothing. He went under an arch and down a hallway filled with washing machines and dryers. The stairs led him up to his room on the fifth floor. Each floor had fifty rooms in it, and they were all usually full. He climbed in to his bed, feeling the walls close in around him. Some people hated these hotels, but Yu found the room to be comforting, cocoon-like. He took off his hat, laid it on his stomach, and looked out the window next to his head. He could see the rising wall of hotel patrons across the atrium, the vendors hawking their wears to drunks down below, and if he strained his head he could see the stars shining through the skylight.

This is my first post on reddit, so if I do this correctly please inform me how to correct my mistake. I'm in the shit right now, and writing has always seemed to help me out. I mostly keep a journal depicting my everyday life, complete with rants, horrible poetry and occasionally something I think people might find interesting. Very few people in my life have ever seen my writing, let alone know that I write. I certainly have never published anything for the public to see; so I thought, so why not start with a bunch of strangers?! Here goes nothing...

-

A good friend once asked me. What is it like? What is it like to be me? ""Humor me, Tony,"" she said. ""Could it really be that bad?""

I thought to myself for a time. This was a good friend of mine, one who I held dear. One who's friendship was highly valued. Is it worth it, letting her in? Will she, no; can she understand the picture I would paint for her?

""Well, Love. Imagine… waking up. It is a beautiful summer day, or, possibly a steel winter night. You walk out to your front yard. You see you neighbor, you chat them up. Normal small talk. No real meaning to it, just trying to be a good person. Good people are friendly. He is telling you about his new promotion when you hear them. They come from the distance, from a new place beyond the horizon. You first hear their song, a wail as beautiful as it is sullen. You walk out to your fence, partly due to curiosity, but mostly because you can no longer hear your neighbor. All you see skin smacking against each other. Imagine what animals must think of us, when observe us talk to one another. Your neighbor says goodbye, ""Gonna be late for work!"" And leaves you alone with the song. 

You smell your food inside, ready and waiting. You remember how hungry you are. The smell is exquisite, your mouth begins to water. You are very hungry. It is time to go in and eat. You turn to take a step, but you don't move. You know what you want to do, but you cannot. You want to run from the song, run to the arms of your loved ones waiting inside. Whisper sweet nothings into your Lovers ear; perhaps even get a little frisky before you leave for work. That always make Monday a lot more bearable. 

But the song. That beautiful, horrendous song. You have heard it before, you're sure of it. If you can only remember how the next part goes, satisfy that yearning which screams on the tip of your tongue. And then you remember, the Sirens. Alas, they have come for you again! What are you supposed to do next, if you could only remember what Odysseus did next. Was it moss in the ears, perhaps beeswax? Wait, what story is this again?… I think I was the Odyssey. And besides, the house across the street is a distinct Queen Anne Victorian You reassure yourself. You know these types of things, your a carpenter dammit! That's the one thing that will always keep you grounded. 

A man and his chosen craft. Your identity! You are a hard-working, blue-collar American. You make the world go round. In a slightly manic state, you grab your hammer and swing. Not aiming at anything, with no real purpose behind your actions. You swing. 

They rip through the sky the same way your son tears apart the newspaper for his confetti. They leave behind them a trail of heavy, crimson red. You had though you learned all your colors when you were a child, How foolish you were. You are enthralled, drawn to the succulent beauty hue. This is surely God which you witness. It utterly destroys you; still you scream for more. You helplessly grasp for the sky, yet the endless Tahoe would not quench this thirst.

And then it hits you, perhaps harder than the last time. One should not desire for this much. It is not the way. And it is too late. 

Red mist gushes from the cuts in the sky. Surely you were never meant to see this much. It covers everything that you have ever known. Your Love, your Child, your Home. You hear your son scream wildly for his father. ""Why is he like this! What did they do to him!"" You warily grasp for your hammer, your essence. But that too, the red consumes. It overtakes you, and you remember another familiar hue. A black more absolute than the edge of infinity. You hear one more cry from your son. Then silence.

Train girl 

She stands on the platform,

A blur of paint and metal.

A yellow line keeps her at bay.
She shuffles forward,
two toes over the line.
She feels the wind flash over her face.
It passes,
SWOOSH, a vacuum of air,
her scarf floats onto the tracks 

A yellow line keeps her at bay,
two toes over the line
She jumps, 
She lands on the tracks below.

She picks up her scarf.
The tracks are warm, her scarf is warm.
She turns,
Fingers stretched, grabbing at the ledge,
she half pulls herself up.

She slips.
She grabs again,
She slips again
Rattle, rattle, rattle
No one is around.

She sweats, she grabs, she slips.

she slips again,

Two tours in Afghanistan with the Army Rangers, counter-insurgency advising in East Africa, and interdiction work against Mexican cartels round out his resume. After a life at war, the FBI seemed like a calm alternative. A chance to spend time with his son and try to reconcile his strained relationship with his wife.
  But when a string of brutal murders and attacks ripple across the nation, carried out against the rich and powerful by a group calling themselves *American Sin*, Dempsey finds himself back in a war zone. This warzone isn’t filled with RPGs and rifle fire, though. This is a war of bureaucracy and corporate espionage, and a group who's true motives remain a mystery, but whose tactics are starkly similar to those of the groups Dempsey has spent his life fighting.
  And when the attacks hit close to home, Dempsey is pushed to his limits as he is forced to choose between the lives of those he loves and the lives of thousands of innocent bystanders, as he confronts his own past sins, and uncovers the true nature of *American Sin*.

This is just a quick post to clear up some submission concerns, as well as outline some ways to ensure yourself a better experience on this subreddit.

**Numero Uno:**

When asking for critique, please include a [Feedback] or [Crit] tag in the title. It's easier on the eyes for everyone, and we can see what you desire without a long title introduction. 

**Numbero Dos:**

Please title your submissions. No ""Untitled"", or even ""Working Title"". Frankly, this information is useless and irrelevant. Users will also not be able to hunt it down easily if they remember they've enjoyed it. Just name it after your dog or something, or your stripper name. DO NOT post that you are a first time writer in the title. *You* may think it is humble and self effacing, and that perhaps people might go easier on you, however this is not the case. It is a premature and vapid apology for the content to follow, however much you might mean it. That content, the title, is for topic and content. If you wish to make a formal apology, include it in your post's body. My advice: don't be a Canadian.

E.G.

GOOD

*[Feedback] ""Lassy"" 1800 words, Conceptual-Future-History/Thriller Erotica*

BAD

*[Feedback] Hello everyone, my name is Dog and I'm new. Please, go easy on me! ""Lassy"" 6854 words probably too much, Conceptual-Future-History/Thriller Erotica all of it completely consensual NSFW*


**Numerous Quarterus:**

Which brings us to our next topic:
Subgenrefictation. 

If the genre could be a subtitle to your story - don't. This is why we can't have nice things. One genre, one attribute therein. Horror/Zombie, totally okay. Horror Dystopian Zombie Erotica Mystery, nope. 

**Number five in spinach:**

**NO BLOGNOSING**. /r/KeepWriting is for constructive *criticism*, not validation. Please do not post links to your blog in a feedback request. Or really, your blog at all. If your submission has a high word count, consider posting an excerpt. If someone would like to read more, comment with a link to the full work. 

Also, if you are submitting a serial work, consider posting it in larger chunks at a time. The goal is to build your ability to be self sufficient and think critically; if you just farm things out constantly, you're going to dilute your instinct to do this and everyone's attention spans.

**Se7en:**

**The ONE rule of /r/keepwriting is that you MUST contribute feedback on another's work before submitting your own. If you are new to critiquing leave your honest impression of another's work. They will love your feedback.**

The moderation team will have an aneurism tracking through your comment history, and tactfully reminding you to read the sidebar in your post. Sometime soon, this will not be possible, or we'll all be dead. 

Please leave feedback and participate. Nobody here is getting published. There is no point to promotion or read counts. You should only care how many people read your work if you want that number to be equal to how many problems and plot-holes are pointed out. We're here to learn from each other.

**Numero Otto:** 

If you downvote a [Feedback/Crit] post, try to leave a comment with what you didn’t like about it. It could help the poster deserve your upvote next time. They will get better and your eyeballs will be more pleased.

--------------------------

Thanks everyone for reading! If you are new to /r/KeepWriting or would just like to tell me where to go, leave a critique! There are spelling and grammar errors, purple prose, tense changes, and many fallacies. Oh, and fallacies galore! Redundancy. 

As a bonus, this will count towards the feedback you need to leave before you post.

with love,

Then came the ultimate kick in the balls.  As if life weren’t shitty enough already, the fucking world ends.  Literally.  God must have a dark sense of humor, because it couldn’t have been a solar flare or climate change or a nuclear holocaust; no, it had to be fucking plague.  Infected crowded hospitals and clinics, then eventually lined the streets.  I guess the reason it spread so quickly was that the symptoms were so tricky.  You would feel fine, better than fine, until the end.  Then it acted like a bad flu:  fever, aches, chills, and some bad cold symptoms.

Then the victim would die and re-animate.

It was a fucking zombie apocalypse.

And now, four months later, Carter and I are still truckin’ along.  Lucky us, our father had amassed a respectable cache of weapons and a fallout shelter;  the happy consequence of a war-worn Marine with a knack for thinking up worst-case scenarios.

“Sam, we’re out of peaches,” Carter called from the kitchen.

“Check the pantry, bottom shelf on the right.” My voice was saturated with sleep, but I cocked my head to the side in wait.

“...Thanks.”

I paired a smile with a shake of my head and pushed off the afghan quilt.  It, like everything else in the room, was a beige-and-tan set.  Mom had always liked brown, said it was neutral and warm.  Personally, I hated it.  Brown is the color of dead grass and dog shit.  But hey, the bed is comfy and Carter gets her own room.

I put on my boots and walked to the kitchen, scratching my head.

“Morning,” Carter muttered, nearly inaudible over the sizzling pan.

“Smells good,” I said, kissed the top of her head, and shambled to the table.

“I know what you’re thinking,” she scraped scrambled eggs and Spam onto my plate.  “But I’m not running the generator dry.  Remember when we scouted Graham’s place last week?  I went back last night and nabbed two gallons of gas.  It’s not old, either, he must’ve siphoned it off of a car or something.”

“You went out, alone, at night?” I aimed for a stern glance, but I ruined the facade with a chuckle.  “Crazy kid.  At least let me know if you’re going out.  Jesus.”

“I would have but it’d ruin the surprise.”  She spooned peaches into a bowl.

“What surprise?” I asked, forking my breakfast down.  “Oh, man is this good.”

“It’s your birthday, numb-nuts.”

“Hm,” I nodded.

“Happy birthday,” Carter mumbled around a mouthful of peaches.

I raised my fork in salute, then swallowed its contents in mock-toast.  We savored the first hot meal we’d had in months in silence.

“So, what do you have in mind today, birthday boy?” she smirked, mopping the peach syrup up with her forefinger.

I shrugged, “There isn’t much we can do.”

The end of the world isn’t as liberating as many imagined it would be.  No streaking down Times Square;  the scent of that much exposed skin would draw the undead right to you.  No breaking into stores;  some had automated alarms that’d ring the dinner bell for a two or three mile radius, not to mention the awful clientele.

What I really wanted was a cold beer.  It was my twenty-first birthday after all.

""Did you ever drink with your friends?” I asked.

“Sometimes, but never enough to get drunk,”  Carter replied simply.

“How does a cold beer and some fresh air sound?”

“Fantastic.  Let’s make it happen.”

I have not written anything other than high school/college essays, so I don't know if my essay writing style translates well to fiction. I'd love critiques on any and all aspects of the writing, content, etc. so that I can continue improving.

___

One of my fondest childhood memories comes from first grade. I’m not sure why I remember this event so clearly, but it stands out in my mind singular in a midst of half blurred frames and missing pieces. 

I was unhappy because my friend Ryan was not in class. I did not have many friends as a first grader, and with him missing my recess would likely consist of sitting by myself, fiddling with dirt and small stones, as was the norm for children without playmates. 

When I was a child I used to get extremely nauseous in anticipation of something unsatisfactory to my psyche: the first day of school, meeting new people, recess alone. Luckily I have not carried this with me into adulthood. I recall this day feeling exceptionally poor. My stomach felt like it was lying sideways in my gut. I believed I could feel the acid rolling around within my overturned tummy, scared that it might cause permanent damage to my insides should my stomach explode and leak out inside of me.

I was an extremely paranoid and frightened child. 

As the teacher prattled on about this and that, I believe we were learning about adding and subtracting, which I already knew, I tried to focus on not running to the bathroom to purge myself of this horrid feeling. Each time I told myself “recess alone isn’t so bad” all I would do is connect that to my stomach, which would again focus me on my predicament. I really wish we were learning something new. That always took my mind off things.

I noticed the teacher began looking over towards the window seats while slowly stopping her stream of information. Our classroom was set up in six groups of four desks, two students facing the windows and two students facing the door in each group. I was in the group closest to the door, facing the door. Soon the entire class was looking towards the windows. I spun around and found it was for good reason.

Outside on the blacktop adjacent our room was a humpback whale. It floated on air, moving as though swimming through the sea, tail moving rhythmically up and down, slowly swaying side to side. It vocalized a few times; that throbbing, high-pitched yet incredibly deep moan which echoes through your chest. The children were amazed, as was the teacher. We could only sit and stare at this majestic mammal manifesting itself on our humble elementary school’s first grade playground. I was very upset that Ryan was not here to see this. I stood up to move towards the windows.

And that is when I woke up. Because, obviously, humpback whales don’t just appear out of thin air, 10 miles from shore, FLOATING, on a school playground. 

What you’ve just read is what this book is all about; it is a collection of my dreams, dreams I can remember as detailed as any moment of my actual life.

&gt; “Yo, sleeping beauty, up and at ‘em. We’re due for a Forecast in tee minus ten.”

&gt; The swaddled form in the bed grunted. Yuri rolled his eyes.

&gt; Yuri checked his watch, then drove a knuckle into the soft dozing form in front of him. He heard a muffled yelp. “I’m serious, get up Darl. If I get another demerit from that hardass Sowser in Systems because you couldn’t get out of bed at a decent hour, I’m going to shove you out of an airlock. I‘m not joking this time, I‘ll do it.”

&gt; No answer. Yuri ripped the blankets forcefully back from the circular bed. A tangle of arms and legs and surprised faces lay underneath. There was a shrill scream.

&gt; Yuri threw the covers quickly back on the bed, performing an abrupt about-face. He cleared his throat.

&gt; “Various naked people, if you would please remember that this is a Technicians’ Quarter, and you have to be escorted–”

&gt; A giggle from under the blankets.

&gt; “…Anyway, break it up. Darl, if you don’t get up this very instant, I’m going to recommend that you be transferred, preferably somewhere horrible.”

&gt; Yuri walked out of the quarter and leaned on the wall outside of Darl’s door, crossing his arms across his chest.

&gt; After a moment, a young brunette emerged, combing her mussed hair with her fingers. She eyed Yuri and flipped him a wink before sashaying off.

&gt; Yuri started to move for the door when it opened again. A young man with strong features and olive skin jerked back with wide eyes in the doorway. Yuri raised his eyebrows, then moved back with a *No, after you* gesture. The young man exited past him quickly.

&gt; Yuri walked back into the quarter. Darl was in the bathroom, taking a piss naked with the door wide open.

&gt; “You’re incorrigible.”

&gt; Darl walked back in when he was done and began to throw on his clothes. “It wouldn’t hurt you to lay some pipe every now and again.”

&gt; “Not very discriminating with regards to the plumbing, are you?”

&gt; “What can I say? They’re a cute couple.”

&gt; “Ugh, okay. Enough of that. Just hurry the hell up.”

&gt; Darl walked past Yuri in his pajamas and out the door. Yuri followed him.

&gt; “You know, I really think you abuse this casual Friday thing.”

&gt; Darl threw his hands up. “What does it matter?” He jumped up as he walked to slap at a hanging light. “We’re on the Big Voice, it’s not like anyone can see us.”

&gt; “It’s the principle of the thing.”

&gt; “I still think if you got a little ‘casual’ once in awhile you wouldn’t continually be on the edge of a nervous breakdown all the time.”

&gt; “Can you blame me for taking my job seriously, Darl? We’re in charge of climate for this whole damned colony. Without us the crops would die off, people would go hungry and thirsty, the biosphere would be destroyed–”

&gt; “Yeah, yeah, lives hang in the balance. Yuri, it’s just a little rain. It’s just a little sun. Lighten up.”

&gt; They walked into the climate cabin. They sat down at the console and pulled up the analysis screens. Humidity, air pressure, temperature, oxygen levels, carbon dioxide, light spectrums.

&gt; Darl put on the headphones while Yuri worked the switchboard.

&gt; “Should have got numbers for those two,” Darl said.

&gt; “Seriously, I haven’t even had coffee yet,” Yuri replied, disgusted. “You’re going live in eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.”

&gt; “Good morning Icarus! This is Darl Rock with your friendly neighborhood Climate Control, here to give you your daily Forecast. At 0630, there will be a rain shower lasting until approximately 0100 hours, so get those hydro collection systems ready and bring in the laundry. As a complement to the First Crop, we will be scheduling a series of gentle storm systems this week to aid germination in the Agricultural Station. Per standard operating procedure, we will also provide precipitation alerts prior to all climate activation. Thanks, and as always, enjoy that wet weather!”

&gt; Yuri took a slug of coffee from the side of the console and switched off the Big Voice.

&gt; “And that’s a wrap. I can’t believe you actually get paid to do that.”

&gt; “It’s the silky smooth vocals, my friend. They make all the little space bunnies moist.”

&gt; “A chimp could do your job.”

&gt; “Aw, that’s not even nice. You’re just being grouchy now.”

&gt; Yuri accessed the climate control panel, beginning the precipitation sequence. Darl adjusted the monitoring system.

&gt; “Beginning precipitation sequence for the *U.S.S. Icarus,* Colony Log Day 4116, Hour 0615,” Yuri said, his words clipped and professional.

&gt; “We’ve got a go for Rainmaker Five,” Darl said.

&gt; “Affirmative. Proceed.”

&gt; “Countdown sequence in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one…”

&gt; Both Darl and Yuri waited for the rainmaking lasers to shoot into the sky of the colony, illuminating the seed cloud that hovered at its ceiling. Beyond it, they could see the glittering vastness of space like diamonds on black velvet obscured by a mist.

&gt; Nothing.

&amp;ldquo;Help him to his feet.&amp;rdquo; That woman. The one I once vowed to obey. &amp;ldquo;Let him see.&amp;rdquo;

A Hand with sad eyes and a clenched jaw stands before me. The one I called friend.

&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. Please understand, I had to do it! I couldn&amp;rsquo;t let you fall this far after everything you&amp;rsquo;ve done for me.&amp;rdquo; He wavers. &amp;ldquo;But I spoke for you. She has promised to forgive your mistake if you admit to it.&amp;rdquo;

I ignore him. It&amp;rsquo;s her I must understand.

&amp;ldquo;Why let me do it?&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;You did *nothing!* What did you hope to achieve with words from the past?&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s no trace of forgiveness in her tone. &amp;ldquo;You fought for cattle that need to be prodded towards the proper way. That&amp;rsquo;s what they *chose* to be, but you tried to change that. All you&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished was treason.&amp;rdquo; She comes one step closer. &amp;ldquo;Your hope was false.&amp;rdquo;

*&amp;ldquo;You* are the lie and the traitor.&amp;rdquo; I spit. &amp;ldquo;The people chose you for their guide and you made me step on their necks for you.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;Lest they become their own victims, of course. My fist must be iron.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re disharmony. Deception doesn&amp;rsquo;t last forever.&amp;rdquo;

Her eyes narrow.

&amp;ldquo;You aren&amp;rsquo;t the first to choose death in vain. You&amp;rsquo;ll be an example.&amp;rdquo; She raises her voice. &amp;ldquo;Gather the crowds and take him to the square!&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re the one who&amp;rsquo;s afraid.&amp;rdquo; My voice doesn&amp;rsquo;t falter. &amp;ldquo;I may die, but you will lose.&amp;rdquo;

Do I believe this?

Emergency Communications is a self-sustained room, with electrical circuits independent from those of the rest of the Palace. Sitting on enough batteries to keep the tape players running for one whole night, it could be used to issue warnings to the whole city should the need arise, through loudspeakers powered by underground armored cables. The reinforced doors and walls have been built to withstand the attack of an army &amp;mdash; if the room is closed, all transmissions can only be interrupted from inside.

There&amp;rsquo;s never been a greater need.

Shaking, I set the tapes in sequence and adjust the equipment to start over when the last reel finishes playing. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe I&amp;rsquo;m bringing about the end by flipping switches and pushing buttons. Soon, my world will no longer exist.

I activate the locking mechanism, setting it to ignore the release buttons on the outside. After one last look at the spinning harbingers, I check the time &amp;mdash; the Sun rises as I walk to my death.

We cannot afford to remain the same indefinitely, because nothing around us will stop changing for our sake. Take for instance our sniveling subjects: as they grow weary of our ways, the harmony we treasure so dearly grows threatened by talks of revolt. We will naturally crush rebellion before it starts, starting by ourselves. We cannot allow excessive mercy, humility and reasoning to hinder us, which is why your blood will flow today.&amp;rdquo;*

No, surely those are lies.

Surely?

But if not, what does that make of me?

Impossible&amp;hellip;

'I need to get out of here.’ he interrupted.

‘Ah…well, you can’t.’

He had not expected that.

‘What?’

‘They’re keeping you under observation for a week.’

He didn't need this. He had to get out of there. He was getting used to sleeping in that room. Waking up in that room. He was sure that if they ever got a hold of him, they’d never let him go.

‘No they’re not. Give me my Jacket, we’re getting out of here.’

‘No, no we’re not. You’re staying here until they figure out what’s wrong with you.’

He sank back to the bed. There was nothing wrong with him.

‘What did they say?’ asked J in a light voice, as if he was scared of the answer.

‘They say you're showing symptoms of Dementia.’

A smile formed on his lips momentarily. It quickly faded.

‘Dementia’s a symptom, not a disease.’

‘Well, they want to run a few more tests.’

He laughed then, laughed. He was messed up. His life was a messed up. It was a bad joke and he was finally seeing the funny side. He was finally laughing.

‘That’s what they always say when they don’t know anything.’ he said, still laughing.

Always.

‘Listen J it’s all for your own..’

‘Get me out of here.’ said J. His laughter had died but he was still smiling. He was always smiling.

'Listen J…’

'Get me out of here Jane please, or I swear it’ll happen again.’ he was shaking. ‘I can’t stay here. If they find out they’ll never let me go.’

‘Hey, hey listen to me. Calm down okay. I’ll get you out of here I promise. They can’t keep you here. I won’t let them.’

She put his head on her shoulder.

*This shouldn't be happening. This wasn't what was supposed to be like this.*

‘I’m sorry.’ said J

‘It’s Okay.’

”I shouldn't have done it. I…I was just…’ he was convulsing.

‘She was calling me ‘ he said.

‘She was calling me Jane. She said...' he couldn't speak. His voice was cracking up.

'It felt…it felt like the right thing to do at the time.’

‘It’ll all be okay.’ said Jane.

‘I won’t do it again I promise Jane…Just take me home and I won’t do it’

‘You can't promise that.’

She kissed the top of his head and then headed toward the door.

‘I’ll see you in a week J. Take care of yourself.’ said Jane and then turned around and headed for the lobby, failing to fight back the tears.

J sank back onto the bed and closed his eyes. He then tried to sleep and in doing so, just for a little while, he tried to forget.

SO! I've had this idea for a story since I was eleven or twelve (now 15) and I can't put it off any longer.  It simply needs to be told.  The problem is:  I feel like I've outgrown it.

The idea is this:  A girl goes to a finishing school for kids with powers.

It's diluted, overused, and teeny-bopper.  I've come to resent the idea, which makes me sad (it was my first ever idea for a real 'novel').

I've tried to write it from several different perspectives with several different twists, but I can't get it off the ground.  I seem to quit just after I've begun.  Everything feels wrong.

So I've come here to ask for your help.  Has anyone been in this situation?  If you overcame it, how?  Any tips to prevent this from happening in the future?

I really don't want to abandon it, but I'm at a loss for what to do.

Heat settles under my sheets, spreads like chewing gum in my hair,  
    clings to the back of my neck, a bubble of heat blooms between my thighs.  
Heat is in the bathroom, clawing down the shower curtain,  
    breathing on the mirror, laced with the air and the shower’s steam  
    like so many flies in orbit of the dying.  

  

Heat has a secret to tell me. And it tracks me down every street,  
        into every store, rides shotgun in my sedan.  
Heat refuses to leave until it has finished whispering into my ear,  
        stroking my scalp, hugging my shoulders.  
Heat says “This is important.” Heat says “Where ya going?” Heat says “Wait, there’s more.”  
And heat will be heard.  

Heat is not shooed by ice, by cool mist, by box-fans or shade. Heat is only stalled.  
It waits on the porch, a curled up hound with your scent in its nose and its tail  
    patiently swaying.  

Heat is Ahab’s harpoon. Heat is the sharks swarming Hemingway’s great fish.  
Heat is on every page, hidden in the epilogue, slipped inside the dust jacket.  
Heat is the author’s portrait in a black sweater, eyes half sheathed by a glare,  
    grinning its straight, white teeth.

Personally I don&amp;rsquo;t consider them as such, at least not just yet, for I think they still aren&amp;rsquo;t on to the filth this all is. As for me, I&amp;rsquo;m their target and they&amp;rsquo;re sworn to eliminate me as quickly as they can. I&amp;rsquo;m a threat.

They&amp;rsquo;ve long ceased giving warning shots.

I don&amp;rsquo;t blame them, I really don&amp;rsquo;t. They haven&amp;rsquo;t had a couple hours to think on the implications like I did, they haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the taped executions. They haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the joy on the faces of the executioners. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect them to believe any of that very easily, what with a general alarm blaring through the whole complex along with my newest label.

I know this building well. I know where all the corridors lead, where all the stairs are, as I do the best exits and even the secret ones, as well as the hidden passages.

I&amp;rsquo;m cornered. There&amp;rsquo;s a door across the large conference room, my only way out of here.

I run. They shout.

That was the scary part. He didn’t know IF it ended.

‘WHAT HAPPENED?’ She asked.

He peered over and looked at her. She looked pale.

‘Nothing’ He said.

Nothing at all

‘IT’LL BE OVER SOON.'

Okay.

He took off his glasses, faced her and  asked what was on his mind. What had been on his mind for all this time.

‘Can you forgive me?’

She smiled. God he’d misses that.

‘NO’

A nervous laugh escaped from his lips. Well, what had he expected?

She laughed. After all this time, he could still make her laugh like that.

‘You know J, you talk in your sleep’.

Paul landed on his arm and he had the breath driven from him. He coughed and sputtered, struggling draw air even as the pain in his arm curled him into a fetal ball once again. The girl was at his side then and he felt her rip open his sleeve at the stitching down the side. There was a small gasp and she pressed warm fingers to his arm. “What be your name?” she asked. It seemed an absurd question while she was kneeling there, his pain making any attempt at speaking nearly impossible. He had to concentrate, drive away that pain in order to form enough coherent thought to answer her. “Paulin,” he begain. “Son of Ga—“

A terrible wrenching pain overtook him as she pulled a large piece of wood from his bicep with a sharp, swift tug. He howled in anguish, turning his face into the ground and crying out that he wished he were dead, anything but that pain. “Your arm is bent up,” she said coolly and then the pain was nothing to the sickening sensation of his shoulder popping back into proper alignment. He retched where he lay and had to pull his head back in order to not swallow it again. His head swam and the world went white with pain. Hoping he would slip into unconsciousness, he rolled onto his back and closed his eyes.

A slap pulled him free from any hope of blissful unconsciousness. The girl’s face was looking down at him and her hands were pulling at his collar and then looping an arm beneath his shoulder. She grunted and he felt himself being pushed up but only for a moment. She let him drop bodily back to the ground. The pain returned and he groaned, clutched at his arm and found that even more painful. He resigned himself to a whimper and clenching his teeth to keep himself from touching the wound. “Your bloody iron chest-thing is too bloody heavy.”

“My what?” he asked, his head swimming from the throbbing in his shoulder. Rather than answer she began looking for how to undo the mail. “You can’t,” he groaned. “We have to,” he bit back a scream of pain as she lifted him by the shoulder to his knees. “Have to get someone to help me lift it off.”

The girl paused here, her hands on the back of his neck. “You are… well never it mind, I can’t bloody well carry you so you’ll have to bear the bloody thing until we get there.” All of those words sounded like word soup to Paul as he stood with her assistance. His sleep had not been restful for a wave of tiredness immediately overtook him. “Where are we going?” he asked, then moaned as he stumbled and his shoulder had weight suddenly pushed upon it. He glanced at her and she seemed to be smiling. Her front teeth were too large for the rest of her mouth. Paul thought she looked like a rabbit. “What are you grinning at?”

Her smile faded but her mirth did not. The corners of her mouth seemed to tighten, trying to contain it. “Tell me!” he demanded, the sudden force of his words causing him to cough, which set off more pain in his arm. She turned to look at him now. Her eyes were dark brown. It reminded him of mud which in turn reminded him of swamps and then the Mossfields and Bearkiller. He shivered. “Never met a bloody noble who was rescued by a girl… nor one who soiled himself rotten.”

He turned bright red. With every step he realized she was right. His underclothes were damp and rotten. Fear had made his bowels loose their contents. *Just like I had let loose my honor. They will call me the Thegn of Shit if they call me a Thegn at all.*

“Battle, I was wounded.”

“You look no more than a boy in silly armor. Are you sure you’re a nobleman? Where is your shield or sword? All noble fighters have those.”

He bared his teeth and clenched his fists, but the pain made him relax them. “I am a Thegn of House Halloway. My men were attacked by Mossfields and my shield was destroyed by the Bearkiller and my sword…” He paused, turning red. *I had thrown it away*, he told himself bitterly. *Like a coward*. “I lost it in the confusion.”

The girl only nodded and then grunted as he stumbled, shifting to keep him upright. She’s strong. The realization came suddenly and when he looked at her again, really taking her in, he was surprised to find that she was nearly as tall as he was. Her shoulders were narrow, a woman’s frame for sure, but there was a wiry strength to her. Her arms beneath his felt like taut ropes and she never tired as they trudged on through the edge of the forest. In the distance he saw smoke from a chimney. “Where are we going?” he asked her, realizing she had never given him a proper answer the first time.

“My grandmother’s,” she said. “We can find water and fresh bandages.”

“I need to get back to my men,” he said instinctively. *Do I? The battle may not yet be over or the Mossfields could have won*. Once more shame hit him hard and his chest felt like it was full of lead. His cowardice squeezed at his heart like a vice. The girl saved him. “You are not going anywhere like that. You were lucky I happened by, there’s mushrooms out that way you know. Grow there where your big, silly body was crushing them.” She offered another amused smile. “Do noblemen ask maidens for their names?”

“They ask noblewomen for their names, you are just a common girl,” he said. Instantly, he wanted the words back. Yet the harshness of his voice must have been harsher to his ears than hers, as her smile broadened. “Mayhaps I’m a noble lady in disguise? Ya never know.”",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1ibgnb,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1ibgnb/feedback_hallow_hill_part_45_ish_continuing_my/,

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_q6qdRm5J2QRWFFVWNyMWppQTg/edit

There she is. Your little girl is sitting behind the piano quietly developing the new tune she’s been working on. Her feet dangle off the bench as she plays; she’s not quite big enough to reach the peddles yet. Each time she makes a mistake, she’s been having trouble finding the middle C lately, she bashfully drags a wisp of loose hair behind her ear and looks up at you, smiling. 

You’ve finally found the perfect spot for the piano. It’s rested in the corner right next to the bay of windows looking out to your expansive field. The way the sunlight is bent through the arches casts a sort of spotlight on her little body. This is her stage. 

The piano is an antique. It was recently left to you by one of your neighbors; the old man down the row whose palsied hands taught your daughter to play. It wasn’t a bequeathal or any part of his will, the old man is still alive and well as far as you know. He left with all of the others. They heard of the impending danger and evacuated without asking any questions. They said it was stubborn of you to stay behind with your family, stupid even. But you haven’t sensed any imminent peril or risk in remaining. This is your home, the golden fields surrounding it your livelihood, to leave would be to abandon everything you’ve worked so tirelessly for; to surrender. 

Your girl’s song weaves in and out of your awareness as you pace around your home, occasionally looking out to the dirt road. You don’t necessarily know what you’re expecting but the inevitability of it begins to get louder. It feels as if you’re standing on a beach just as the tide begins to rise. A sensation of consumption comes over you. 

Your daughter serves as a welcome distraction from it all. Each tender keystroke wears down your mounting anxiety. You begin to feel at ease in your own home again. It’s been so long since you’ve been able to feel safe. Long, sweaty nights have pervaded recently and a lingering sense of peril has defined your existence. Looking at your little girl you think that this must be something sacred. 

Whatever obstinacy your neighbors have accused you of is clearly false. Everything in your home is perfect. Nothing could disrupt this. The ringing out of the piano’s melody acts as a signifier of the innocence and security that envelopes your home. Everything is going to be fine. 

*

Two riders carved their way through a dirt road, their machines leaving streaming wakes of dust. The dark green military motorcycles roared in an industrial way while the leisure of the riders’ posture suggested a pleasurable venture more than an official one. In fact, the combatants were returning from a ten day leave in the closest city-center and were in generally high spirits considering they were returning to the lines. 

They traded turns leading each other in a game of cat and mouse and feigned dodging in front of the other in playful attempts at running the other into the surrounding field. They wore the standard green uniforms synonymous with battle but with little attention paid to standards of military fastidiousness; open buttons and loose chin straps combined with untucked shirts and scuffed boots. 

The pairs’ faces were ensconced in a layer of dirt that covered their skin wholly. Every laugh, though, established a new fault line in the coating and revealed the tanned and weathered skin of a motorcycle man. An iridescent set of teeth gleamed through each smile, uncovering a treasure of white untarnished by the dust of the atmosphere. 

Along their careless cruise the rider’s took in the sights of the country side that they were passing through. Most of the houses appeared to be abandoned as this had not long ago been the scene of a significant battle. They were told to be wary of any traps that may have been left behind by retreating axis soldiers; mainly landmines. As of yet they hadn’t seen any suspicious plots in the ground but one got the sense that they would be easily dodged as the riders displayed a fine grace while they tore through the road.

Remnants of war were strewn about the landscape – empty craters, broken down tanks, and abandoned artillery abound. Vestiges of people’s former lives also showed themselves along the road as most of the houses appeared to have been used for quarters or sacked for any food or valuables. 

Up ahead one of the riders noticed a piano lying on the side of the road. Its varnished exterior scratched and scuffed through the rough treatment it endured in being dragged out of a house. The rider imagined its previous life and ruminated on what hands might have played it before its current fate. Keys were missing and the exterior was cracked and broken. It even appeared as if some flora were beginning to claim it. 

The road ahead began to narrow as the riders were about to enter a wood-lined section of the passage. Massive trees bordered this section of the road and their touching leaves created a formal entry point resembling an archway. Just as they were coming upon the shadowed tunnel side-by-side one of the riders ripped ahead of the other. At first the trailing party began to laugh as had been the ritual for the duration of the foregoing but now he noticed something peculiar.

Between the very first two trees that were on either side of the road was a bird. The bird was not perched on either of the trees nor were its wings in motion. It looked as if it was levitating in the direct center of the pass. With its chest puffed out and head twitching, surveying its surroundings, the bird presented a puzzling spectacle. Finally, the rider understood what it was and called out to his leader but his voice was dwarfed by the growl of the engines. It was too late anyway.

The leading rider’s bike and torso remained in motion through the ravine but his head and helmet remained behind. When the trailer came upon his partner, his face was down in the dirt with his helmet ajar. He could see the back of his neck, a brown patch of skin with matted black hair unfurling on top of it. 

He pulled up slowly to where the bird had been. The sunlight glinted off something metallic and the weapon that ended his friend made itself visible. Strung between the two trees was a thin and steady length of piano wire.

I would eventually like to see it become a completed short story, in the pseudo-non-fiction category, as the Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity. I have photographic evidence of the event, which would be used in conjunction with the short story to instill a sense of it being very real. This is my first attempt at any serious writing, however, I really want some great feedback. Thanks~ (Rough draft of part 1 as of 7/13/13 11:11 PM EST)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The lives we lead are either by choice or by fate; and a night such as this one, could be nothing but fate. Waking up to flames outside my window; I could see the strong flame’s silhouette dancing around maniacally. The smell of pure flame filled my sinuses, forcing me to become more alert than I was accustomed to after waking up. It was in the darkest of the night, where the loneliest person could not be found, nor heard. I rushed outside to see the fire for myself before calling the fire department. To my surprise, it was less than I expected; it took out two twenty foot trees, along with the metal fencing behind them. For reasons unknown to me, it was somehow dying out. Within the minute, it was extinguished; I couldn’t believe my own eyes. I am not a man of science, nor a man of arson. My mind could not process the entire ordeal, and I even looked around to assess that I was in fact, not dreaming. 
     

With the flames gone, the night was much darker than I could imagine; in all directions were only faint colors and movements, quite disorientating. As I went to grab my phone out of my pocket, I heard footsteps to my side – behind the garage, which had a small fortified pond blocking myself from the area. I had come outside in the middle of the night without thinking, witnessed a fire, and now heard footsteps near me; I should have been terrified. But it was at that precise time, that I became fueled by adrenaline. I don’t know how well-wired my human body is, but this was likely the absolute worst time to decide to ‘fight’ in a ‘flight or fight’ situation. I ran towards the pond, leaped over it, and peered behind my garage. Nothing there, hardly any grass let alone someone capable of producing footsteps. 
     

 “Am I just becoming paranoid?” I asked myself out loud, as if wishing for something to happen that would explain the chaos that happened. Wishes sometimes come true, and my luck wasn’t exactly in my favor this night either; I saw a figure maybe 20 feet ahead of me. It was two figures, in fact. One of the figures was noticeably larger than the other; both were heavily draped in black. Perhaps the darkness of the night had shrouded them from my sight, it was certainly plausible. But before I could understand the situation, the shorter figure leapt the short wooden fence, while the larger figure began pacing towards me with its arm reaching out to me.
    

 “I already called the police!” I shouted, attempting to sound as mighty as I could. “Did you start that fire? What’s your fucking problem?” I couldn’t believe what I had just said; everything within me was screaming to run. I am certain if it hadn’t been so dark outside, I would have been visibly shaking. But to my surprise, the large figure that was previously approaching me, stopped. I could feel its eyes sizing me up, and I concluded in my head that my chances were not good. I immediately began running back to my house, which was maybe 100 feet away. The figure did not budge, and eventually vanished into the night as I slammed through my living room door. 
     

 I went to dial 911, but my ‘luck’ had run out; my phone was dead. I sprinted towards the landline on the other side of the house, when something occurred to me, “It wasn’t this dark when I woke up.” I tried to resist my paranoia and edge further into the house, but I was paralyzed by fear when I saw what was in front of me; my landline telephone, on the ground, and in the middle of the bedroom. Several rooms away from where it normally was. It was so innocently sitting there, begging me to pick it up. But if you have ever felt fear of this extent, you know what I mean when I talk about not being able to move a single muscle. 


 “I called the cops, they are almost here. Run while you can.” I said in a very calm tone, trying my hardest to bluff for the first time in my life...successfully at least. But everything I had seen up to this point had been so minor in comparison with what I saw lying on my pillow; my cell phone’s battery. Perhaps in my haste outside during the fire, I neglected to notice the battery on my pillow. But all of my attempts at making sense of what was going on stopped completely, as I felt the sharp and cold steel press against my neck. I was trapped; both physically, and within my own mind.

I look from a window at the immense stretch of cobblestone I&amp;rsquo;ll have to traverse in order to follow the instructions I was given.

Two things can make a large yard become immense: having to cross it unseen, and doing that under a full Moon. It&amp;rsquo;s still a few hours until sunrise, so this may actually be my best chance. I&amp;rsquo;ll take it.

For the billionth time I ask myself why all the haste. Once more I have to remind myself I&amp;rsquo;m no good liar. Not the absolute truth type, because a Hand&amp;rsquo;s words consist of what he&amp;rsquo;s told to say, far from reality as it may be &amp;mdash; as long as it fits the will of the Powers, that is. Inscrutable wisdom governs us all.

I know they&amp;rsquo;ll see it right through my eyes, faster than they would should I choose to use words. Thus I rush so that I&amp;rsquo;m not killed before I can do something &amp;mdash; so that I can do something before my guilt kills me.

Many doors open into the cold yard, half of them obscured in shadows. Not those on this side, as it happens. At least I can suppose this will read better in the stories, if I can make it that far. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to take as many small consolations as I can get.

The skills I learned here help me unlock and open the front door without a rustle, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t teach me how to be invisible. I must either hug the wall and let the whole plan balance on that, or just give up.

After a few steps that felt too many, I stop to rest under the shadow of a door canopy. I can&amp;rsquo;t breathe.

Inscrutable wisdom governs us all. That part might actually be true.

I'm very new to writing and this is one of the first things I've ever given a legitimate stab at. Reading it over though, I find that  my flow is a little all over the place and that there are storytelling opportunities that I'm missing out on . I'm putting it here to get a sense of what you all think of it. GoogleDocs is being a bit ridiculous with me, so I'm just going to put it all here. 

-------------------
There was no moon. Fog and darkness weighed down on the village of Cinderly. It stilled the air and froze the place in time, forever locked in the last night of its inhabitance. The doors of all the houses were open, fruit carts lay overturned in the street corners, their bounty long rotted away,  and the cobblestone streets that linked it all together were wet with the early morning dew. Most of the windows were broken, and the ones that remained were coated with a melting frost that made them weep.
	
The manor house at the southern end of the village was one of the only homes left furnished. The Lord and Lady's bedchamber on the second floor remained as lavish as it looked on the last night it was slept in. A giant four poster bed dominated the right side of the room. The sheets on it were covered in a thin layer of dust but under it,  the unmistakable stain of dried blood still remained. On the opposite wall, a wardrobe and mirror framed a large hearth lined with ornaments and figurines. Gifts they had received from the villagers over the years. They were all now burdened with a dust that seemed to weigh them down to the mantle. The smiling faces on them were twisted by the dust and darkness to where they looked mournful. The wooden doors on a window at the end of the room were open, allowing the cold air into the bedchamber and chilling the bones of the woman waiting by it. She sat in a guest chair, its red embroidery graying from years of abandon. There was no wind, but the frigid air forced her to keep her cloak tightly wrapped around her. She kept her hood down.
	
Her thoughts were in two places at all times. One half kept reminding her of the eeriness of where she sat. It kept her fully alert. Always reminding her that at any moment, she could feel a hand on her shoulder. The hand of Lady Yane, who was killed over the very bed to her right four years ago. She feared if she would turn,  the Lady would be looking down at her through tear clouded eyes. Her white robes heavy with blood. Then she would open her mouth and scream the Widow’s Wail. The one she screamed four years ago when the soldiers broke down her door and thrust her Lord husband’s head into her arms. The one she screamed after they drove their swords through her belly as she looked into her lover’s dead eyes. The one that woke the capital, and is still spoken of today.
	
The other half tried for naught to make her forget that and keep herself focused on the reason she was here. She had to keep watch out the window if she didn’t want to miss the signal. From here, she could see the northern facing wall of the capital quite well. And at its base, she could make out the sewage drain that was her target. Sometime tonight, when the sewer spit a lit torch aside from its usual waste, she would know it was time to move. For that’s when she would meet with the nameless man she was told would come with the package for her. Bandages, salves, and ointments for her people back home.
	
Her eyes strayed upward to a small ember dancing in the sky.  Beneath it, she could see the silhouette of a guard making his rounds along the top of the capital walls. Even from here she could see his dark hair, and the thick cloak that covered him from the neck down. His armor glistened in the torchlight as he walked, stopping now and then to  peer over the edge. A few dozen yards ahead on his path, there was a lit brazier where three other soldiers sat talking and resting their legs. Every now and then, one would laugh or cough loud enough that she would hear him here. They would be the only sounds in the otherwise silent night. None of them ever looked in the direction of the village, as she expected. The Widow’s Wail was now more of a tale used by people in the capital to scare their children into behaving, but most soldier’s knew It all to differently. None of the men who heard it first hand were alive today. Of the six who came into Lady Yane’s bedchamber that night, one was found hanging in his home shortly after, another went missing, and the other four simply walked off the capital walls together one night. The ones who weren’t found broken beyond recognition the next day still lay with their eyes open, the fear in them plain in the early morning sun.

You wake up every morning and you just *know* they'll be there, because that&amp;rsquo;s where they&amp;rsquo;ve always been. It&amp;rsquo;s only logical. Something that&amp;rsquo;s stood so firmly for so long is bound to last for at least that much more time.

Then a tiny bomb comes along and blows everything out of place. Imagine throwing a grain of sand into the air and whacking the Sun out of its daily route.

As befits one as proud as I was of being a Hand, I lived for that Sun just as much as I lived by it. As is written in the Book, they *need* us. We&amp;rsquo;re instrumental in the continued harmony of all the realms, we&amp;rsquo;re the executors of the Powers&amp;rsquo; work among mankind. Our name does fit us: we&amp;rsquo;re their Hands.

I may not have been the greatest ever, but you&amp;rsquo;d be hard pressed to find many more devout than I was.

A grain of sand later, I want to chop off as many Hands as I can.

To be fair, all we did was at the Arms&amp;rsquo; command. To be practical, all that chopping off would amount to nothing, as men like us almost sprout from the dirt at the snap of a finger. As the saying goes, ten fingers are born for each five that fall. The Men of Law had seen to that, wise as they&amp;rsquo;ve always been since the beginning. As days fade away, the Powers will remain.

A man can live on despite the loss of a limb or a couple thereof, as I have made so many realize. Such noble acts. Relieved of his head, however&amp;hellip;

That was what I had to do. What I&amp;rsquo;ve just done.

Mine will be the noblest death of all.

Deep inside I wanted to believe I had just been too hasty to act upon a rumor. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last half an hour trying to convince myself that the note I found earlier was part of some plot, the work of a spy bent on destabilizing me. They&amp;rsquo;d been successful at that, I&amp;rsquo;d give them as much, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t about to let a bunch of random scrawlings turn my world upside down.

Or was I?

I know better, I know I do, I&amp;rsquo;m *certain* I do, I&amp;rsquo;m *positive* I do. If repeated lies can cease to be such, telling myself the truth over and over again can only make it stronger, right? Everything&amp;rsquo;s all right. I have no need to be afraid, because the good side is mine. Only those in error find reason to fear. Not me.

My fingers tremble as I pick up a reel from the shelves of the Archival Section. I&amp;rsquo;m trying my best not to make any noise. I&amp;rsquo;ve already breached regulations for leaving quarters outside my appointed time. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep. I figure if these are mere slanders, I should be able to debunk them right now. If not, I&amp;rsquo;ll find &amp;mdash; forget about it, it&amp;rsquo;s all lies and I know that.

Yet the instructions are remarkably precise. Archival Section, Storage 2D, fourth aisle from the wall, third shelf. A box labeled &amp;rsquo;Lifeblood&amp;rsquo; in green ink. Any can should do, especially one of those marked with a star. They&amp;rsquo;ve already been here, whoever they are. The proper course of action would&amp;rsquo;ve been to present this piece of paper to my superiors, but &amp;mdash; I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t. Those responsible risked death by putting this on my hands, yet they did.

As my stomach twists, now I know why.

The purpose of this post is to brainstorm
ideas with other writers and talk about concepts you have in the works and get
opinion.

Got an idea for a story? A concept for a character? Random thought in your head? A particular writing nitpick?


This is where you can discuss these ideas (or ramble on, seriously we are okay with you rambling on. You are a writer now - you are allowed to mutter and mumble in tortured tones under your breath now while clutching at your official writers headgear)  and get feedback on them, figure out what works, and help develop it further.

I know they&amp;rsquo;re here somewhere, that it&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time before they find me. I gave it all I could, knowing I&amp;rsquo;d eventually have to accept the fact that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t escape. Yet by some instinct I refuse to give up so easily. That&amp;rsquo;s how I ended up here in the first place.

I&amp;rsquo;m shivering. This may be me dying, but then again I&amp;rsquo;m soaked. They say some people feel cold right before the last moment, but is this mine or am I just wishing it so? *Cough!* I&amp;rsquo;m choking, tasting blood in my throat once again. It&amp;rsquo;s a wonder I still have any left. Thankfully they can&amp;rsquo;t hear me as I hack my guts out.

Nor I them, for that matter. The sound of the window shutters clapping against the walls is even louder than the howling of the wind. For all I know, they could be just around that corner over there. I almost wish they&amp;rsquo;d show up and finish this business already.

As I prop myself up against the wall, a jolt of pain flares through my left side. This will leave the kind of scar that turns into stories for grandkids &amp;mdash; or rather *would,* as I won&amp;rsquo;t have kids to begin with. There won&amp;rsquo;t be enough time left for this to become a scar.

I can&amp;rsquo;t think clearly, not that it matters much now. The deed is done. They can hunt me all they like, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing they can undo or hide anymore. But if that&amp;rsquo;s so, why do I insist on living? I thought I&amp;rsquo;d already come to terms with that. I&amp;rsquo;ve already played my part, my real part &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;m no longer important.

My memories are starting to blend together. What have I done? Was I really a savior?

I was still asleep. They banged on the door for a couple of hours before I finally answered.

""Something something something loans for first bank national,"" they said.
I couldn't understand them. I was still a bit fuzzy in the head.

""Your boss something something.""

""Is that so?"" I asked.

In first grade, I took spelling tests. My mom would make me sit at the dinner table and spell out words. Whenever I misspelled one, she would get mad at me. I don't remember how she got the list but every word she told me to spell ended up being on the test the next day.

Spelling tests were alway on Fridays. One week I felt that I was unprepared so I spent homeroom that morning writing out every word three times on a sheet of paper. When it was time for the test, I put the sheet between my legs and read off it. I got a 100.

I did that on all the spelling tests after that. There was a bit of a thrill to it. I was proud of myself until Ms. McGunniss finally caught me. She asked me how many times i did this.

""Once. I forgot to study this week and needed to keep my grades up so my parents wouldn't get mad at me.""

I was the victim.

Ms. McGunniss wrote a note and told me to give it to mom and dad. I gave it to dad.

""Jake."" he exasperated.

""What?"" I asked.

I was valedictorian of my first grade class. They had this whole ceremony with the entire class and all the parents in the audience. I got to shake the principal's hand.

""Congratulations,"" he said.


""Thank you, sir,"" I said.

I have these really skinny wrists so if i ever get arrested I'm pretty sure I'll be able to slip my hands through the cuffs.

Mom started taking antidepressant medication a few years ago. That all started when she lost her job and sister. She spent two weeks in bed. One night she asked me if i could take her to the doctor in the morning.

I didn't answer her.

""Jake can you answer me?"" she pleaded.

I just kept on watching TV.

The way I found out she was on antidepressants is kinda interesting. I was looking for some food to eat one day and i was going through the cupboard. There were a bunch of new medicine bottles in there that I hadn't noticed before. I took a few and looked them up online. I considered popping them to see if they made me feel any better, but it's gradual medication. Taking one pill isn't going to improve your mood. I figured if I started I would eventually get caught.


When mom was working for the bank, she would take the bus downtown. She didn't drive anymore.

In college, I worked at a grocery store. Whenever the customers weren't looking I would put their bread in first and crush it with cans. The best part about that was while everyone who came there had to spend their money, I was given mine by being there.

Before they hired me, I had to join the grocery store union. The highest pay and easiest jobs were given to the people that worked there the longest.

""Put it on the tab,"" I would tell my landlord at the end of each month. I got evicted from my apartment three months after starting work there.

Bob had worked there for ten years when I arrived for my first day. One time after his shift I saw him leave with a 30 pack of Natural Light.

""Have a good vacation Bob,"" I said.
""I surely will."" he said, smiling.

Bob once told me he would have loved to have gone overseas to Italy and backpack up and down the country. I think he was 48 when he told me this, with a bit of a gut and a horrible smokers cough. When I got off that warm summer night I remember crying in my car before finally driving home.

I always feel an uneasiness when summer comes along. I know its been said before but summer really is the unfulfilled promise of spring.

I was told not to come into work so i slept in. I had worked for Securities Trading for three years now. My job was to encourage banks to sell loans. After being there for six months, I was able to buy a nice loft with a view of central park.

The sun was in my eyes as I looked out the window. I yawned and stretched. I got a glass of water from the kitchen and went back to bed.

It was dark when I woke up. I was hungry. My fridge was empty. There was this very nice deli on 42nd that I liked. I was so hungry I changed into my running clothes so I wouldn't look so crazy when I ran there.

My legs got tight pretty quick and I didn't feel like running anymore so I stopped. I wandered around a bit eventually making my way there. I got a turkey sandwich with swiss on rye. It was very good.

After my mom lost her job, she changed. Vodka at noon. Lunch at 2. Vodka again. Then bed.

Matt was drunk. Grant was drunk. They all were drunk.

""God, I'm such an alcoholic,"" Matt said.

""Yeah man. Looks like it,"" I told him.

""You're not drunk,"" Matt said.

""Not really, no.""

""You think you are better than the rest of us. Can't get drunk with us.""

""No, I'm just a bit less misunderstood.""


Jake stared at me for a second. Then laughed in my face.

""Smoke break,"" he exclaimed to the room, turning away from me and pointing to the back door. Everybody followed.

The experience of living with roommates was so bad and I was so broke that I felt that I had no choice but to move back home. It was easier living at home. Mom spent most of the day in bed so I just kept really quiet all the time and everything was fine.

I can't remember how I met Helen but it was sometime after I had moved back home. At first I thought Matt had put her up to it as a joke. After I called her out on it though, she kept coming back.


My phone rang. It was Helen. ""Hello,"" I said.


""Hey.""

""Oh, hi Helen. What's up?""


""Nothing. What are you doing tonight?""


""Oh. Nothing. Dinner. Maybe a movie. Wanna come?""
""Umm.""
""You don't have to if you don't want to.""
""Yeah. I'll come.""
""Yep.""

I was going to school and I was happy for that, other than all the driving I had to do. To and from campus every day . It was tiring and expensive. It would have been better but Helen was making me spend just about every evening with her.

""How was you day?"" she would ask.
""Oh fine. Just like yesterday I suppose. I would respond, hoping she wouldn't ask me tomorrow. She always did,

My routine went something like this---Get up. Eat. Watch some TV. Go to school. Then go to work. Stay at work. Cry at work. Come home. Eat. Then bed. And for tomorrow-- do it all again.

Helen finally broke up with me when I forgot to make time for her. Also I couldn't afford the gas to drive any more than absolute necessary.

My bags were packed and I was all ready to go. Nothing was holding me back anymore
""Well, is it time?"" my mom asked.
""Yep.""
""Ok."" She came towards me. We kissed goodbye. ""When will you be back? Chirstmas?""
""Probably.""
""Good-bye George,"" my dad said which is weird because he had been dead for ten years now. We shook hands. ""Good luck."" 
""Thanks dad.""
""Take care of yourself.""
""I will.""
I started the car and backed out of the drive way. Taking one last second to look back at mom and dad standing happily on the porch, I waved goodbye and drove off. I had planned on leaving ever since I discovered there was an outside world. All I remember feeling is fear though.

I'm not sure if they would be proud of me now. I did make a ton of money though and I lived pretty well. Life in here isn't so bad. I get up, eat, work out, go to bed. Maybe read a little. My corrections officer said that I could get out a few years early if the patrol board approves my case. I've got a good chance too, seeing as they don't take financial crime too seriously in this country.

I was never a believer in karma, but all I could think about that day was that I must have really pissed someone off in one of these lives. The day started with an alarm that didn’t sound and a phone call from my boss inquiring when I was planning on showing up. I knew it was a rhetorical question, but I felt like pushing redial and answering him all the same - Go fuck yourself. I might have been out of a job, but by the end of the day, that day, I was down a whole lot more.

And since we are on the topic, I was never a believer in fate neither, but after 3 hours on the shore of Blackpool beach with the old tower throwing a shadow at me, the sand in my shoes, and the cold aluminium of a gun pressed firmly enough against my head that it gave me a migraine, well that’s enough to make anyone ask Why? Marilyn Monroe (or was it Aristotle?) said that Everything happens for a reason. Well Marilyn, if you have any answers I would love to hear them. Dear anyone else: I’d ask you to stick your guesses on a postcard, but I sincerely doubt that I’ll be around to read them.


I shouldered open the apartment door and the piercing rain greeted me like an old friend - an old friend whose mother I had somehow wronged and was now after revenge. I zipped up and figured that if I ran to the stop I could still make the next bus into the city, and if I could make this next bus, I could make it in before 10, only 2 hours late: enough to save my job for sure, perhaps even my ears from my boss’s worst. So I ran through the park and past the supermarket. I turned the corner of the main road to see my bus pulling away, and as I paused to ask myself for not the last time that day, Why? - a passing car drove through the puddle and covered me with water. Another checkpoint where I should have given up on that day.

The next bus was 20 minutes later, and I waited with my old friend and his pal the wind, who wasn’t a big fan of mine neither. Katy had taken me along to a meditation class last year to help me control my temper. Conversely, it actually helped me channel my anger into more focused, condensed balls of rage, stored to be released when just the right moment comes. I hadn’t used my anger in a while, but it was comforting all the same to know that it’s there on the bench, a game changer waiting to be called on if needed. I breathed in, I breathed out.

Chapter 1

I reached up in my closet and pulled down a box filled with my comic book collection. I started flipping through a comic called The Invisible Boy and The Legend of Gormon’s Glasses to pass the time and lose myself for a while. The Invisible Boy was one of my favorite super heroes. Whenever he donned his mask he gained superpowers. My favorite of which was to turn invisible but I guess flight and slowing time were pretty handy as well. In this particular comic he faced his greatest enemy to date, the evil lord Gormon. Gormon was from the empire of Caripicia and he had a pair of glasses that allowed him to see The Invisible Boy. Just as The Invisible Boy slowed time and was about to smash Lord Gormon’s glasses I heard a siren and then two doors slamming consecutively outside of my house. I put up my comics and peaked out of my bedroom window. The flashing red and blue lights were nauseating.

Knock, Knock, Knock! “Mr. Castrazza it’s the police. We’re here about your wife, Ann.”  I could hear my father escaping out the back of the house before they so much as knocked on the door. He had a drug problem and he was undoubtedly terrified the police were at our house to arrest him. I ran into the living room and threw my dad’s used needles under the sofa cushion.  I answered the door reluctantly.

“Hello there son, is your father or other guardian home?” inquired the fat policeman.

“No sir. My father just left a few minutes ago and my mother is at the store.” I replied.

“How old are you, kid?” the taller officer asked.

“I’ll be thirteen next week.”

“We need you to come with us then. We are going to take you to see your grandmother.” He said as he directed me to their vehicle.

I hesitated for a moment but in the end I went with them willingly out of fear that they might come in after me and see the heroin and needles lying around the house. I’m sure they expected something. We lived in a single wide trailer with black garbage bags covering all of the windows. We had two bedrooms and one bathroom. There were broken shards of mirror on the floor in the bathroom that my father punched yesterday when he got mad at my mother for hiding his heroin. He almost killed her with one of those shards that night. Our living room was just a couch, busted TV and a coffee table recently littered with used needles, a spoon, a lighter and the vanilla bean candle. Sometimes my dad would use the vanilla bean scented candle to cook his heroin; that’s when we knew he was in a good mood. On vanilla bean days we knew we were going to have food on the table that night. And it was likely he wouldn't beat my mother.

The drive was short and quite.

“Why are we at the hospital? Is my granny okay?” I asked as I stepped out of the police car.

“Your grandmother is fine but your mother was in an accident. That’s all we were told. Your grandmother said you might be in danger with your mom in the hospital so we came to get you.” he paused as the taller officer chimed in.

“Is everything alright at home, kid?” asked the pear.

""My parents don't usually leave me home alone like that my dad said he had to step out for just a few minutes. Everything is good at home, sir."" the last part was a lie and I am sure he noticed.

He left it alone all the same. The taller officer escorted me to meet my grandmother while the fat one hung back flirting with the receptionist. My grandmother was a tiny woman with an enormous heart but she did look thirty years older than she was. The stress in her life showed in every wrinkle and grey hair. She was in tears when I saw her and the sight of that made my throat sore. She opened her arms and gave me an affectionate hug and kissed my forehead for a few seconds. “Anthony.” she said. “I am so sorry. Your mother was in an accident."" she said as she wrapped her arms around me even tighter while tears streamed down her withered face. ""Your little brother was killed, Anthony. I am so, so sorry. I love you, Anthony. Everything is going to be okay. I swear we will get through this.” she just rested her head on my shoulder and wept.

At this point there was no holding back the tears. I have never wanted to believe in heaven more than I wanted to believe on that day. I went in to see my mother and she looked awful. She was covered in scrapes and bruises but I knew which ones my father was responsible for. I held her hand and cried for what seemed like hours. She was unresponsive that night. My grandmother entered and told me we had to leave.

Chapter 2

Later that week we found out what had happened. The story was in all the local papers and one of the news stations even covered it until the giant mosquito invasion in Florida became a more relevant story. My mother was crossing the street with my little brother holding her hand with groceries in the other when a texting driver whipped around a corner smashing into them with no warning. He was so involved in his text he had forgotten to turn his lights on and his Prius was to quite for my mother to hear him coming. I hated that man. I wanted him dead but I was in no position to take someone’s life. My grandmother said the bastard would probably get off easy. At the time it made no sense to me how that man could be allowed to do anything but die.

My father had gotten me back from my grandmother against her will. She had no custody rights so she had little choice but to let me go back home. I believe the only reason he got me from my grandmothers was to spite her. He hated her more than he hated me I suppose. My father was about as bad as I had ever seen him. He was a large man at six foot four inches. Not someone you wanted to pick a fight with, especially when he was hungry for another taste of heroin. He would go into a rage; blaming my mother for the accident. He would find something or someone to hit and then shoot up more heroin to make the pain go away. He loved my little brother more than me because I was not his real son. They never got a DNA test but he just knew I wasn’t his kid. He tried apologizing for leaving me when the cops came but ended up beating me instead. With my mother still in the hospital I got to be his new punching bag. I gladly take a beating for my mother but with her not here it made getting beat pointless.

By the end of the week my brother had been cremated. I sat starring at that vase for hours with a bowl of soggy cereal in front of me. It was hard to acknowledge the fact that my brother was in a vase above the fridge. Brrring, brrring, brrring. I got up to answer the phone.

“Hello?” I asked as I put the phone up to my ear.

“Hi, is there a Mr. Castrazza available? This is the St Martins Union Hospital calling in regards to Mrs. Castrazza.”

“Is my mom okay?!’ I asked hopefully.

“Yes, your mom is fine. She is ready to leave the hospital and needs a ride home. Is your dad available?”

“He is out of the house right now, mam. Call my grandmother instead.” I gave them my grandmother’s number and hung up.

I ran into the living room to tell my dad but he was passed out with a needle still hanging from his vein. I walked over and removed the needle and put him on his side with his arm under his head so he wouldn’t choke on his vomit. I think I was too scared of what would happen if I just let him die. Then I called my grandmother to make sure the hospital reached her. 

“I am going to go pick her up right away, Tony. Do you want me to swing by and pick you up?” she asked.

“No thanks granny. Just please bring my mom home. I love you.” I couldn’t let her see what my father had done to me or what he had done to himself.

“Alright sweetheart, I love you to and your mom will be home soon.”

I hung up the phone and ran back to my room. I broke my comic collection back out and started reading another issue of The Invisible Boy where he had to fight a giant mutated Komodo dragon that could breathe fire and detect body heat. The Invisible Boy had to use his wits and hide by the fires to defeat the mutated Komodoian Dragonlord Zarth. I heard a creak as the front door swung open. I slammed my comic book shut and ran out into the living room. My mom walked through the door slowly and I ran to give her a hug.

“Where is Jason?” asked my mom. One of her eyes was still swollen shut and when she grinned I could see a tooth was broken in half. She was still the most beautiful women in the world.

“He’s on top of the fridge” I replied. I could be blunt as a kid. “Dad has been blaming you for Jason dying. I’m nervous about him waking up.”

“It’s going to be ok Tony. We still have each other. I won’t let him hurt you now that I’m home. Also, I got you a gift from the children’s ward in the hospital.”

My mom pulled a blue paper bag from behind her back and handed it to me. I opened it with vigor. It wasn’t every day I got a present. Inside was the Invisible Boy's mask. All black with red outlining and strings to tie it around the head right above the ears. Although I knew my grandmother probably bought the mask I thanked my mom and gave her a big hug.

“This mask will keep you safe and give you strength and courage. I love you very much and I need you to stay strong for me.”

With the first glimpse of happiness on my face in months I said, “I love you mom.” I walked into the kitchen and she followed me to see my brother’s vase. I heard my father waking up in the living room and I put the mask on.

“Go to your room, Tony.” suggested my mom as she kept her eyes fixated on Jason's vase. I complied; fearing what was to come.

From my room I could hear my father yelling. He was asking my mom why she got Jason killed. Why she didn’t look when she crossed the street. She yelled back.

“If you weren’t so doped up all the time I could have left him home you son of a bitch. How dare you” –SMACK! Then my mother let out a cry of pain and a terrifying shrill as I heard yet another loud slap followed by the dull thud of a closed fist.

I knew that was coming. My father was not the arguing type. After the shriek I heard glass breaking. I was terrified. I ran into the bathroom and started weeping. Then I saw something in the mirror. I was invisible.

Chapter 3

I walked out of the bathroom and into to the kitchen. I saw shards of glass slowly descending from the picture frame my father had slammed my mother into. The anger in my father’s eyes made him look deranged. I grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed my father three times in the lower part of his back before the glass clanked against the laminate floors of our kitchen.

As time returned to its normal pace my father let out a terrible cry and crumbled to the floor as if he had suddenly turned into a rag doll. He moaned and moaned but he didn't move a muscle. My mother wrapped her arms around my father and looked around in bewilderment; the knife still sticking from his back. I stared down at them and it took everything I had to stop from laughing hysterically.
What I had just done started to seep into my mind and I slowly removed the mask. My mom nearly fainted when she saw me materialize from nothing. She stumbled back and clang onto the kitchen table, knocking the remaining cereal onto the floor.

“What… What just happened?” she asked, gasping for air.

“The mask, it… it worked. It made me invisible and I slowed time.” I paused, “I can probably fly!” I threw the mask back on and watched as my mother did actually faint. Time was moving slow again as she fell to the floor. I flew into the living room and grabbed a pillow to place under her when she landed. I made it just in time and removed the mask. I got some water and a wet rag from the sink to try and wake my mom up.

“Mom, wake up.” As I patted her head lightly she groaned and opened her non-bruised eye.

“Tony, you disappeared.”

“I know mom. I also killed dad and I can slow time and I can fly.”

“Oh no, Tony, you killed him.”

“It’s going to be okay mom. We have each other and grandma.”

My mom got to her feet and stood over my father for a few minutes. “Go to the hall closet. Get out the bleach and all of the sheets.”

I did as asked. My mom filled the sink with bleach water and wrapped my father up in sheets. We moved his body to the living room and began cleaning the kitchen. Once we wrapped that up my mom said, “When it gets dark we have to dig a hole.”

To save my mom some stress I slowed time and dug most of the hole by myself. I needed her help to carry my father though. I removed the mask and she looked shocked that the hole was done already. “I don’t think it’s a good idea to keep using that mask, Tony. We have no idea how or why it works. There could be serious side effects.”

“It is okay mom. I have read all the Invisible Boy comics. In the comics there are no side effects. It works by putting the mask on. See.”

“Dammit Tony stop putting that thing on.”

“Okay mom I’ll stop using it all the time. But I can’t not use this thing. Think of everything I could do. I could be a hero.”

“Tony. So far all you have done is commit a murder. Why didn’t you just call the police? That mask made you murder him.”

“I won’t use it carelessly. I’m putting it up.” I put the mask on and flew to my room and hid the mask with my comic book collection. I walked back out to the yard. “There mom I put the mask away for safe keeping.”

“Tony, just promise me you won’t do anything else illegal. I can’t afford to lose you and your brother.”

“I promise.” At the time I meant it. But I guess they say promises are meant to be broken.

Spring to life in sleepless violence before dawn,  
to shiver even in the steam of a hot shower while coffee  
drips and spits in the pot,  
to stop and start and stop and start through the drive thru  
for an egg sausage bacon cheese bagel biscuit muffin  
to make your stomach clench and scream,  
a tag team with your burnt coffee  
to make yourself feel as bad on the inside  
as you do inside. You don’t feel up to it today.  
Don’t write to your representative.  

Stand in the hyper-tidy bank lobby  
with a dried-out ink pen, chained to the table  
so that you do not steal from the bank.  
This is their job and there are not enough jobs as it is.  
Where are the jobs? Chained to the bank tellers’ windows.  
Maybe today you will use the ATM. The walk-up  
or drive-through version are both fine. Spice it up  
by navigating your way through the menu in French  
or Chinese or Spanish. Whatever you choose,  
you still won’t have a pen.  
Don’t write to your representative.  

Roam aimlessly along  
the predetermined traffic flow paths of your local  
multinational outlet store. How else would you know  
that summer is coming and that you are in dire lack  
of a fresh bikini? That TV’s have gotten flatter and wider  
and thinner and more real than previously thought was real?  
That chimney flumes went on sale from $19.95 to $19.85?  
And when you pass the cosmetics and toiletries,  
with deodorant standing shoulder to shoulder  
like pink and powder blue soldiers staring straight on,  
you will spy across the tiles  
the stationery aisles with pens, envelopes, card stock,  
and address labels. But while it may tempt you,  
don’t write to your representative.  

Why?  

Your representative is much too busy to be bugged by the prying masses  
who are constantly buzzing, demanding to be let in on secrets and schemes.  
You want transparency?  
We’ll flagship a show on TLC revolving around  
children raised by two hermaphrodites in urban Oregon.  
You demand accountability?  
There’s this new movie about a vampire with magical powers  
like flight and invisibility and the harnessing of fire.  
No more disparity?  
We’ll find a couple different drinks for you to enjoy, then.  
Come on, buttercup,  
throw out some more words,  
see if we don’t suck them into our suits,  
beat them in submission behind our lapel pins,  
and spit out a new, more complex verbal Frankenstein.  
The sequestration of meaning is our game  
and you’re just players. No, not players;  
domestic non-violent combatants of erudition.  
Lost, aren’t you? Look what our words can do to you.  
And what possible good could your words do to us?  
Don’t write to your representative.  

You shouldn’t fear us. Not because we don’t deserve to be feared,  
but because there are such more pressing things to fear.  
Did you hear?  
Parasites from Asia are arriving in cabbage.  
Your children may be at risk in their own school.  
The Internet is here and who knows what that thing can do?  
There is so much of the unknown to fear.  
And you do know us. Remember my face on the posters?  
My name in the yards, backs of cars, and short commercial breaks?  
You voted for us. Or against them. Or with him.  
November is the time to say what’s on your mind and we already know  
everything you might have to say.  
Don’t write to your representative.  

Ding ding. Do we have a winner? No, that’s your dashboard  
chirping. You need gas. You need food. You need bottled water.  
You need pills for that nasty scowl. Maybe you have  
Drooping Lips Disorder (DLD) or Mislead Democratic Resentment Syndrome (MDRS).  
Ask your physician or friends or co-workers  
or the guy ahead of you in the check-out lane  
if Forgetitol is right for you. Side effects include  
bitterness toward the poor, distrust for the rich, jealousy of the middle class,  
predicated opinions, and being more right than *those* idiots.  
Look at you, already two doses behind, three customers ahead,  
for who knows how long? You just don’t have the time for this.  
You don’t know what you’re doing. How will you make it up?  
All that lost time, that is.

The wind on the King’s Road blew strong and smelled of an early spring. Already the bogs and marshes to the west were growing ripe. The stink of the lowlands reminded Paul of a privy. Impatient, he searched for signs that banners would soon come around where the road curved through the forest on the east. Pine forests made it impossible to see and he sat back in his saddle. Rock, his black destrier, barely moved as he sat. The horse was well trained and fierce in battle, if it came to that. Paul hoped it wouldn’t. His father had named him Knight a month ago, but his sword remained undrawn in combat.

*Maybe they won’t come, maybe the Weaver will be merciful.*

His Squire, a young man of sixteen named of Jack, held his banner straight despite the wind. The deep blue fabric flapped as another gust of wind took it, causing the black raven emblazoned on it to ripple and soar. It was the banner of House Halloway, his House. One day he would be expected to take his father’s title as Lord of Hallow Hill, but no son could inherit without being tested. He was almost eighteen and never blooded. His fingers flexed inside his leather gloves and twisted the reigns.

“They’re late,” he grumbled, rolling his shoulders to ease the weight of his breastplate and mail. He was a thin boy and small, and the weight was only gone for a moment before it all came crashing down on his shoulders again. Paul grumbled. Jack was nearly as tall as Loukas and just as big and broad. If Paul didn’t wear the ring of his title, some mistook him for the Squire and Jack for the Knight.

“They’re coming!” Jack said. Paul stood in his stirrups and the hundred men behind him began to stir. Some were his father’s other Knights, others simply sworn swords, but all were his men. Every one of them carried sword and shield and lance. Many of their horses were barded in gilded chain enameled dark blue, like the mail worn by the men. Rock had plate added to his barding, making his head seem to be that of a raven’s instead.

“Where?” Paul said, holding a hand up to shield his eyes. He didn’t see any banners. The bend was clear. The sound of a horse riding up to him from behind alerted him to his uncle’s presence. Loukas was an aging man with a thick beard of gray and a full head of salt and pepper hair. He wore a simple armsman’s cap on his head and only a mail shirt over the blue and black jerkin. His sword was belted to the side of his saddle. “The boy sees the birds fleeing on the horizon, my Lord,” Loukas said and pointed. The sky was full of small birds that had been disturbed from the roosts. “The Mossfield host must have set them off.”

Paul tightened the grip on his reigns and chewed on his lip. Anger and fear burned in his chest. He had come to make peace in his father’s stead. His father was sick with a fever and spasms so violent that the physicians fear he may have the Shaking Disease, but Paul knew that was a commoner’s ailment and his father was anything but common.

“Destroyer take them,” Paul grumbled as he sat back down. “Uncle, let’s get moving and meet them at the turn.”

They moved forward under his uncle’s direction, slow but steady and disciplined. All the lances in his men’s hands were held straight up, an angle of peace, but ready to drop into a war stance at a moment’s notice. Paul licked his dry lips and scratched at his neck where his padded coat chaffed.

“M’Lord?” said Jack.

“What is it?”

“I can see the banners.” Jack was standing in his saddle now, pointing. “Four banners m’Lord. I count four. One with brown and a black shape on it is at the front.”

“That’s Lord Mossfield’s banner,” Paul told him as he stood up as well, balancing in the stirrups as Rock trotted along. “The black shape is a headless man. He thinks it reminds us what he does to enemies.”

“And the yellow with a red crab?”

“Paldors I believe.” The Paldor House didn’t worry him nearly as much as the other two banners. He saw them plain now himself. “He also rides with the Thunder Company and House Pike.” He stopped Rock and halted the line, calling back to his uncle. When the older man came up, he quickly told him the banners on the horizon.

“An ambush then?” Loukas asked, a hand falling on the hilt of his sword. Paul felt a rising anxiety, the sudden spike in fear making his lungs tighten and wheeze. When Jack asked why he was so worried, Paul told him. “He brings the Thunder Company. They raided my father’s merchant wagons just last year and raped my cousin Tessa. She was to wed Lord River’s second son in Sea Gate. No chance of that now.” Paul gritted his teeth, ashamed that his fear overwhelmed any anger he felt.

Loukas nodded, stroking his beard. “We could use River’s men now.”",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1gnxsm,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1gnxsm/feedback_hollow_hill_low_fantasy_looking_to_see/,

Hours, days perhaps, passed. Aderyn lost track of time in the tiny room, alone with her thoughts and memories. At first she slept and waited, but after a time the dreams grew too terrible. They were always of her mother or her brother Caiden. Awful dreams, painful dreams.

Only once did she dream of her father. It was a brief, sweet dream that faded like flavor ice on the tongue. When she woke that time she desperately wanted to hold onto it, to remember it but all she could recall was her father’s laugh. It was deep and wonderful, the kind of laugh that made everyone else in the room smile. Aderyn remembered smiling so many times.

“One day you’ll ignite,” her father said to her once, many years ago. “You’ll glow so brightly that no one will dare look at you. Brilliant. You’ll be brilliant.”

Only I’m not, she thought as the despair took hold. It reached up and took her heart and tried to pry it loose, twisting and clenching until tears fell freely. She’d lost everything and it was all her fault.

The tears turned to sobs, powerful ones that sucked the breath from her. She coughed and gagged to control them, needing air but it just would not come. The sadness was so powerful, so complete that she couldn’t even move. Her fault. It was all her fault.

A sound came from behind the door. It was faint at first, like the rumbling of many glass chips across metal floors. Then it became louder, deeper and Aderyn realized she was hearing voices, hundreds of voices and they were… cheering. She rose from the bed and went to the door, slipping to her knees and pressing her cheek against the floor. From there, she could see through the gap at the bottom of the door.

The hallway was empty but the sounds reverberating off the metal let her know they were coming her way. The cheering was becoming more distinct now too. There were yelps of joy mixed with taunting jeers. Aderyn realized they were cheering and taunting at someone. Had they captured someone?

“Mother?” she whispered to herself.

A crowd stopped near her door. She saw dozens of booted feet crowd around, shifting and jostling. A door was opened, its metal frame screaming in protest against ancient hinges.

“Welcome to your new home, your majesty!” someone yelled. And then, to Aderyn’s horror, she saw the hem of a dress. It was made of the lightest, strongest puresilk and dyed the most brilliant shade of blue. Even the rough treatment the men outside seemed to have shown her, not a tear could be seen. At first, she dared not believe it, could not. Then the woman was thrown to the ground and red hair fell like the rain around pale shoulders. And through it, green eyes stared directly into her own.

*The Queen.*

And then she was gone, pulled to her feet and out of sight. Aderyn heard a metal door slam and lock, not terribly far from her own cell. With her heart pounding in her ears, she strained to listen.

“Seems we’ve had a stroke of luck.”

“Luck had nothing to do with this, you know that.”

“Who would have thought one of them Bright Backs would turn on their own!”

The conversation dissolved briefly into more hooting and laughter.

“Don’t worry, whoever it was is gonna earn outta this.”

“Can’t wait to get our hands on this one’s blood eh?”

“We’ll be unstoppable. You saw her Tell? Blue!”

“For the revolution!”

“For glory, for ruin!”

For a long, terrible minute the men outside were banging on a metal door, shouting insults and threats that made Aderyn want to weep. She forced herself into silence, holding a hand over her mouth and nose. What were they going to do to her? She had to do something! Had to… but… what?

It didn’t matter what, she decided, but she would figure out something. She had to. If she did nothing else with the rest of her life, she could do this.

Slowly, she crawled back to into her bed and listened for a long time before the voices finally died down. All the while she thought about her situation, about what she might do. Think Aderyn, think! You have to do something!

The door rattled and was suddenly opened. A man appeared and grunted toward her. “Food,” he said and lay it down at the base of the door before closing it again. She frowned, sighing at the interruption. *He always comes when I’m thinking, when I want to just sleep or…*

She sat up. He always came at the same intervals, she realized. That only made sense, they had to feed her if they meant to keep her alive long enough for… whatever they meant to do. Resh came to see her once in a while too, but lately they’d had few things to say to one another. He promised he’d find a way to get her out but wasn’t sure how yet.

*Maybe you don’t have to*, she thought. *Maybe I can get myself out.*

As she lay back down, a plan began to take shape.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1eu45j,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1eu45j/the_blood_part_12_serialized_scifi_novella_any/,

I hope Im posting this in the right place. I'd just like a little input on my novel. What is below is very rough considering I just compressed several dozen pages of notes and outline into a few paragraphs. I hope you like it


In one sentence: Set about 40 years in the future after humankind has just regreened the world after the environment lapsed, a young android named Ande must help mankind and machines overcome their differences and prevent catastophy from a rogue computer virus who becomes sentient and takes over most of mankind's technology.


A story revolving around AI culture, their lives told from a machines perspective. 


Its is a juxtaposition; Ande the Android; a creature who walks the fine line between human and machine, versus a computer virus who attains sentience but is completely and totally separate from us. The two characters are bound. Also present is the slow progression of some AI characters becoming more human, and some human characters becoming more and more machine like.


Part 1
Its starts out in a very peaceful future; where man and machine are friends and life is getting better and better every day. The earth had just recovered from severe environmental disaster and people are ready to reach for the future. The kids ride around on hover boards; and connected via their brain to Internet4.0. The cities are massive; eco friendly (with 2 trees for every person) and made with super tall buildings connected by walk ways. If you've ever seen Tokyo3 from Akira you know what Im talking about. Ande and his AI friends (all 'children' i.e. very very young) are playing one day and find themselves outside of the research facility. They go out into the city and the stage is set throughout that chapter. The first part of the book is mostly misadventures; Ande and some humans and some AI's all getting along in a cool future. Meanwhile we keep hearing about Seoul, in which the second oldest AI Okkus has been building a space elevator. Big hype. There is controversy over the discovery of robot soldiers built by Gor. They use the same model as Ande and he is deeply disturbed. The day of the elevators christening Okkus is doing a master cleanup of the city and finds a computer virus. Okkus is killed (or so we think) after the virus reacts and takes over the city; then much of Asia. Ande is infected with the virus though 'is many lightyears too advanced for the virus to properly infect'; so its essentially a harmless parasite in his code.


Part 2
Gor calls all forces to arms and the AIs all start working on ways the prevent the virus from spreading further. There is a scene in which Ande is talking to Com; his best friend and a video game playing AI, and Com's systems switch to overdrive, filling the whole room with the sound of a manic computer. The virus slowly starts to spread, and over time the virus begins to use machines to defend itself when humans try to turn it off. A robot war starts between Gor and the Virus; turning the earth from green to red. Com (Andes buddy) is forced to transfer his code out of the computer it was in when his life is treated; and he binds himself to the closest thing which had the processing power to contain him. These happen to 7 fighter jets; and Com experiences, for the first time what it is like to have a body. Another of Andes friends, Sam, becomes linked with an advanced computer in his brain. These two (Com and Sam) are very good friends and represent the blurring of the line between organic and inorganic. Much of the world burns; and billions (yes billions) of humans die from various causes. Gor is becoming weaker as the war goes on; and crazier. Doing erratic things and making big losses chunk by chunk. Soon the AIs and Ande realize it is their responsibility to end the war, and stop Gor before everything is destroyed. Twice they try to kill him; the first time failed but the second succeeded, mostly. Gor ends up having built himself right into a rocket, and takes off into space when the battle ends.


Part 3:
The virus is now in control; but the tables are turned. This time it is Ande, the AIs, and whats left of the humans turn to do the infecting. A group of military humans had been isolated and cooped up on some island somewhere, and been designing a secret weapon for use since the war started going badly. 'Dragons', like armour, weapons and a valiant steed for the AIs to use in the 'second infection'. The humans had a plan; to pull the virus up by the roots. Ande modifies it by saying it would be easier to convince the virus to move than destroy it; and they decide to push the virus onto the moon before severing the connection with Earth. Ande uses his own infection to take over a repository of robotic soldiers; and feels powerful in becoming a commander. Ande becomes an 'agent of chaos', leaving his troops behind and traveling to UVEs territory to simply create chaos. He reaps a path of destruction; and the reader and Ande both experience traveling though a world controlled of purely machines. It is at this time we learn that the virus has compassion for small creatures, and has many other interesting characteristics. A sensation of 'building up' to a point is felt as the Virus seems to be DOING something. Building space elevators all over the world; retuning cities and replanting the forests. He starts leaving messages for Ande; one in particular is Ande walking into a controlled city and seeing thousands of mannequins dressed up and place din the streets. Another time a painting is seen on the side of a building showing the Virus on one side of the Earth, and Gor, the Ais, and the humans (who appear strangely disfigured as the virus had never seen one in person) on the other side. The day of the offence takes place. This a tick fucking scene for me because I have show events taking place all over the world, all at once. I was thinking of having Ande watching from the moon as is happens but its still tricky. The offensive is successful, Ande and the virus come face to face. They have a moment of clear understanding; Ande realizes the virus never meant any harm and knows something must be done to save him. Ande allows the virus to infect him completely and together they board a space ship and leave Earth.


Other important notes:

Andes falls in love, gets laid. Not sure with a human or machine

Ande and another AI who don't like each other become friends

A side story about Okkus which I havnt completely worked out

A side story about two explorer AIs who befriend Ande named Voyager 3 and 4, who are the first to use the space elevator in its coronation. They leave earth to explore a nearby star, and are two interesting characters for me.


I was told that a story should only ever have 3 main characters; protagonist, antagonist and a rogue player. The other characters are the other AIs, each of varying importance, and a group of future young people.


Protagonist; Ande himself has an internal struggle in that he is both man *and* machine, a true Android. Ande was built by Gor, the first (oldest) AI, and Gor considers Ande his son. Ande is considered the most advanced piece of technology on the planet; using a synthetic brain and other synthetic biosystems. Ande is true of heart and nobel; but beyond that he's mostly just an empty husk for me. I really need to do some serious heart searching for this one. Over the story Ande experiences human emotions, plays games, makes friends, and he brings much of these experiences to the other more distant AIs. In doing so many of those AIs learn (Im told thats a good thing for a character to do) to be more human, or just emotive in general. Ande also discovers very machine sides of himself; an insatiable thirst for data, the feeling of near indestructibility, ect. Ande wonders a great deal about his purpose; as it is hinted that Gor had some darker reason for designing him. It is revolved Ande was built to clean up Gor's mistakes.


Antagonist; UVE (to be renamed; Unidentified Viral Entity). Its a thinking computer virus. Keep in mind this is 50 years in the future. UVE started on the internet in our day; and has grown and grown for decades without ever interacting with us. It is a creature completely separate from our way of existing. We poke it; early in the book, when we stumble upon it, and it reacts! It quickly learns that it needs power stations to live, and takes control of them. Hacking, data seizures and the like. Soon it starts getting more interesting; the virus can see out of cameras, use machines, and its starts moving into the real world. It isn't, however, evil. The realization is slow at first, but once the virus learns that other creatures existed.


Rogue; Gor, the First AI. 9 years old, he helped solve the terrible environmental devastation when he was first built; and proceeded to help humanity build massive cities, go into space, resurrect extinct species, and other marvels. Humanity and Gor are tight. For some mysterious reason it had been impossible to build a second AI for a few years after Gor was created, and it is revealed that Gor is broken and no one has any idea how he works anyway. As the war progresses Gor gets more and more insane; becoming a dictator and losing control over whats left of human kinds technology. Eventually Ande, the humans, and the other AIs have to kill him to end the war (allowing the Virus to take over).


Its a real story; a whole book. I wrote an extremely detailed outline, every event in each chapter in point form. Unfortunately circumstances demanded that I abandon it and I havnt written it out in story form. Its just a plot as well; with nearly zero EMOTION (though a satisfactory about of character growth) Iv got some issues Im dealing with that I'd like some input on though, as well as just general input.


Mostly; I detect two distinct stories within mine. The story of Gor going crazy and mistreating mankind; and the divide between man and machine; and the story about the virus. 


The virus makes it a hell of a lot more science fictiony and a little out there for most tastes. Its good stuff but hard to work with. Iv considered scraping the Virus and combining much of his story into the story about Gor. Still i feel like Id lose something.


I could also use some suggestions on characters foils; with actual personalities.

Today was a day for writing, and he damn well knew it. Outside his window cars rode on by, kicking up puddles formed by the rains of the early morning. The sky was so cloudy it almost looked like night time. For some reason he wished he was in the city, walking down some quiet street with some sad Sinatra song playing in the corridors of his mind. Needless to say, he was a bit of a romantic.
She was gone and he damn well knew that too. There are a lot of things people damn well know but don’t ever want to admit to themselves, let alone anyone else. Sadly for him though, he didn’t have much of a choice in the matter. The night before, half drunk and heartbroken, he listened to how she couldn’t and how great of a guy he was. He also heard about how great of a guy the other one was. That night, standing on her front step as she went inside without even looking back, was the loneliest he ever felt. 
He cursed under his breath as he revisited the night before. He felt like time stopped, but he knew  that it had not. The cars still drove by, kicking up the puddles. The rain still came down like a leaky faucet. She was somewhere smiling in someone else’s arms, then there was him; silent, regretful, and alone, with no prospect of that changing.
He lit his first cigarette of the day and sat by the typewriter. It was owned by his father’s father, who was also a writer. The only reason he was using it was because he was rather impoverished and couldn’t afford a computer. He did not mind, however. There’s a sort of romanticism tied into objects of antiquity, and he enjoyed that very much.
The day wore on, with the passing of the cars and the quiet clicking of the typewriter, and his words were taking him nowhere. The sun was dipping down and he was getting antsy. The last thing on Earth he wanted to do was go out. That would run the chance of running into her. The last thing one wants to do is have their heart broken and then have to live with being around the person who did it in the first place. It shouldn’t come as a surprise, but he damn well knew that too.
Why should she be happy and me not? Why, when I was here the whole time, when I held her with tears running down her face? Why couldn’t I be the one?
These thoughts spun around his head, as they do with all  star crossed people. No kind gesture, no sympathy, no earthly form of consolation could stop them.

I have some ideas for what to do, but definitely could use feedback and more input, please! (cross-post from /r/writing)",meglet,8,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/10y96a/ive_been_invited_to_lead_a_short_creative_writing/,"My 7th grade English teacher emailed me yesterday to see if I was interested in giving a creative writing lesson during a lock-in this Saturday. I'm so honored. And excited and a wee bit nervous. (Class of '99) She's always said she wanted me to come talk to her class, but I always figured it was just like ""yeah, sometime!"" 

I asked her what she had in mind, and she said they worked on fiction, poetry, and essays, and suggested I do a favorite prompt. My husband and I had a great time thinking up ideas last night. I'd like to share and see what you writers think, and see if you have any really fun teen-lock-in-appropriate writing-related activities to suggest!

Ok, here are my ideas. The descriptions start out long and complex and get shorter and simpler as I got used to the thought process:


* 1) This one is about memory and description. I think smells are pretty rare in fiction. For some reason, even though our olfactory sense is keen and the connection it has to memory and emotion is extremely powerful, writers often forget to describe the smells when setting a scene or describing a person. 

Memory's close connection to scent is actually being utilized for the benefit of employees and companies. Corporate offices are using room fragrance to increase productivity - specifically citrus and mint to increase concentration and energy, respectively. Students studying for exams might benefit from studying with an accompanying fragrance and then having it with them, either wearing it or in some unintrusive sniffable form, like an unlit mini candle, while taking the test. Scents help with recall. We can smell something and instantly think of summer camp or grandma's house.  Or the names of the bones in the hand. 

The first time I walked into a college keg party, I was reminded of my grandmother. I couldn't figure out why until I realized that the smell of alcohol had been acutely attached to her in my memory. That was also when it dawned on me that she was an alcoholic, of course. :/ That's bittersweet I know. To this day, recipes with wine in them are always ""something like Grandmom would make."" 

Ok, so, the project: I would light one of my Home Fragrance Oils and then have everyone write a piece about that scent, either trying to describe it, or how it makes them feel, share a memory it calls to mind, or place it in a story. I could do an obvious scent like Pumpkin or something vague like Fresh Bamboo. I'm not sure which way would be more interesting. Pumpkin would get more memories, but something like Fresh Bamboo could inspire pretty interesting short stories or character sketches. 

* 2) I would bring in a few personal items that tend to be very much tied to deep emotions: maybe a hat, an engagement ring, a dog collar, a blankie, a pocket knife, and a trophy. Then students could write a character sketch or short story based on their item of choice. Are those good items? Other suggestions?

* 3) This one is more of a project but very lock-in friendly. I would have the kids bring in old magazines and cut out anything they like to make collages. Teens LOVE to do that. They could be working on that for an hour while they hang out and talk during unstructured time. I don't need to be there for that part. 

They won't know yet that then they're going to use the finished collage as the illustration for an essay or short story. It is the visual representation of your thousand words, however you want to do it. Poetry, short story, essay, whatever. 

By not knowing it'll be a prompt, they'll make really ecclectic stuff from whatever they like. A collage could wind up being totally abstract, or it could be made up of just words, or it could be an homage to a Ryan Gosling, who knows. But whatever they've created will then be the prompt for further creative activity. After 20 minutes of writing we could go around presenting our collages and either explaining them and how the writer used them, or simply reading aloud the results. 

* 4) I would show this Mitchell &amp; Webb sketch, wherein two soldiers finally notice they've got a human skull as their logo and Mitchell says ""Are...are we the baddies?"" 

The prompt would be to write a short story in which someone slowly realizes that despite their passions and convictions, they have been in the wrong all along. I know, it's awkward to go from a comedy sketch to moral dilemma. I need some help. I really like the idea of showing a comedy sketch, because it acknowledges forms of creative writing not generally studied in school. And it's fun. I am not sure my teacher wants the kids to be writing comedy sketches, but it's worth asking. 

* 5) Mitchell &amp; Webb then gave me this idea too, after my husband and I spent dinner quoting our favorite sketches from That Mitchell &amp; Webb Look.

First I thought, ok, I'll write down 25 of my favorite M &amp; W quotes on little pieces of paper. The kids then draw quotes from a hat. They now have to write something with that quote in it somewhere, somehow. 

Then I thought, forget limiting it, and get the kids more involved! They each write out a favorite quote from a novel, tv show, movie, comic book, song lyric, whatever. They won't know what for. Then we mix 'em all up and draw from the hat, etc. 

* 6) The group should be high schoolers of all ages. The seniors would write a letter to the younger kids about what they want them to know, as they face leaving a small pond, where many have been since kindergarten, to head to college. What are they appreciating more, what wisdom they want to pass on, what are they not worried about as much, etc. The younger kids write letters to the seniors about what they want them to take with them when they go, what they want them to remember, what they want them to keep doing. It's a smallish k-12 school, with about 500 high schoolers, so everyone essentially grows up together and know each other.

* 7) I would take my two dogs, one enormous mini dachshund who'll be 2 in May, and the other a glassy-eyed, nearly toothless she-beast of a papillon who'll be 10 next month. The assignment is to write a conversation between these two, or the running inner dialog of just one of them. 

* 8) I play a song. I have no idea what song, or wether it would be instrumental or have lyrics.  That song is the soundtrack, the theme song of a character or story. Or they write an essay interpreting its meaning. 

* 9) Since Halloween is coming, we do something spooky. I give them a print-out of Stephen's King's ""The Man in The Black Suit"" and the short poem ""Antigonish"" (Aka ""The Man Who Wasn't There) since those are short. Might even cut the asking story to just the meeting with the man. 

Then the kids write a story. They can write about meeting the Devil, or, if that's offensive, write about a spooky thing that happened to them or something they were afraid of as children.  It can even be funny. I'll try to keep it let but let them be as dark as they are comfortable with.

* 10) My husband's joke: ""Imagine you're not at a totally lame lock-in on a SATURDAY NIGHT doing *assignments*. What are the *cool kids* doing? Describe what you can really only imagine the kegger at Royston's house is like . . . in iambic pentameter. Snap, 
I'm headed there now. PEACE OUT LOSERS!"" 

I laughed. 

So what do you think?

*I also wonder about logistics. I have about 45 minutes to an hour. 

* How much time do we spend on writing? 

* I see it as 5 minutes introduction, 5 minutes discussion of prompt (depending on which) 20 minutes writing, 15 minutes discussion and wrap up. Possible? 

* Do we read aloud or keep our work to ourselves? 

* Instead of reading whole prices out loud, kids could read their favorite sections. 

* Instead of focusing on the end result, we could talk about the creative process, what sort of ideas they had and discarded, how they chose to do what they did. Wether they found it challenging or the inspiration was strong. 


I don't know, I've been out of high school for over a decade, and out of college since '03! I've never done anything like this, but I've always wanted to. ANY ADVICE OR FEEDBACK would be much appreciated by me, and by the bright young people I'll be guiding Saturday night!

At least that is what he had told himself since he had started getting into trouble at the tender age of 12.

His life started to fall apart the morning he woke up to discover that his parents were gone. For days afterward he kept trying to convince himself that there was a logical explanation. 

He never knew what became of them, they never returned. He tried not to blame himself for this, even though his father had told him how bad he was every time he screamed at him. He had no idea his father said it simply to justify his abuse. 

He was now going to have to make his way in the world alone, without any help or guidance.

Dante moved through the aisles, stashing items in his coat. He noticed one of the clerks had started following him, so he angled as if he were going to look at the magazine rack next to the exit, and instead bolted for the door. He ran until his lungs burned, fearing he would be caught. The food would last him for days though, so it was all worth it. 

The next time, it went much more smoothly. He choose a different store and paid much more attention to where people were in the store and made sure to avoid them. They never suspected a thing. It eventually became a game to him, seeing how much he could get away with.

One day he returned to the apartment, only to find an eviction notice posted on the door and a padlock barring entry. That was that. He easily forced the door open and collected the few things he couldn't do without.

A few days later, Dante stood in the electronics store watching a big screen TV. The program was about Parkour, also known as Freerunning. He was fascinated.

Soon he was moving through the city like a ghost. A roof top flip onto a lower rooftop followed by a forward roll, he was up on his feet and running on, then dropping to a stairway below. Up and over the railing and landing on the sidewalk, he ran up the corner created by two intersecting walls to grasp the railing and pull himself to the balcony above. Nothing was impossible. His body grew hard and strong through the years by practicing this physically demanding art form.

He taught himself how to gain entry to anywhere he desired. Buildings became nothing more than clever and sometimes intricate puzzle boxes to him. All he had to do was figure out the correct procedure required to open it. He could get in, take what he needed and sometimes got the opportunity to have a place to stay, even if only for one night.

Shortly before his 16th birthday he was picking his way through the homeless huddled under the bridge seeking shelter from the incessant rain. He was unexpectedly assaulted by a man in grungy clothing, brandishing a knife and demanding money. 

Dante weighed his options. The man was much bigger than he was. He was standing uncomfortably close and Dante could clearly see the man's adam's apple bobbing up and down as he spoke. He smelled bad and looked even worse. Dante looked around at all the people gathered under the bridge. All he saw in their eyes was pity.

Dante took a couple quick steps backwards, the man stepped forwards and reached out to grab him. He was ready for him. Stepping forward and throwing all his weight into it, Dante punched him in the throat. The man toppled backwards, dropping the knife and trying in vain to force some air through his crushed wind pipe. All his frustration, all his rage was now unleashed on the would be attacker. Dante viciously beat the man until he was utterly exhausted. He then went through the man's pockets, taking anything of value. He picked up the knife and looked at the faces around him. There was something new reflected in their eyes, it was fear.

Fear was much better than pity. He now realized that he was powerful enough to simply take what he needed from others who already had it. 

All it took was varying degrees of force applied in the correct way at the correct moment. It was easy once you understood that basic principle. 

He had no remorse. No compassion. No moral code to temper his anger. He had forgotten what it was to care about anyone but himself. His skills and reputation grew. In the fulness of time, he became a man.

Standing in an alleyway one rainy November evening, leaning against the cold brick of Rosenberg's Deli, Dante found himself watching what seemed to be a struggle for life or death.

Three young men circled an elderly gentleman, their knives flashing in the near darkness. Dante watched as they danced in and out, slashing at the old man.

Dante started walking towards the fight. As he got closer he could see that they didn't seem to be doing any real damage to the man yet, just trying to scare him.

The man threw his wallet to the ground, but clutched a small brown paper bag close to him. “Take it! Just leave me alone.” He begged.

“Sure poppy.” The tallest of the three said with a deep slow drawl, scooping up the wallet. “What's in the bag?”

“It's for my grandson!” the old man yelled.

“Hand it over poppy!” grinned the tall one. Dante named this one Lurch, after the Addams Family character. He remembered watching the show with his grandfather many years ago.

“Give it up” intoned the short muscular looking one. Dante decided this one was to be known as Riddick, the Vin Diesel character.

“Let's see what ya got, buddy boy!” said the small quick one as he darted in and tried to grab the bag. He decided to call this one Barney Fife.

The old man's fist smashed into Barney's nose just as he started to dart in.

The old man backed away from the group. “I told you! It's for my grandson! He needs it!”

Something within Dante shifted the tiniest bit. For the first time in many years he almost allowed himself to feel something for another human being.

Barney slowly rose to his feet. He staggered slightly, holding his bleeding nose. Then fell flat on his ass again.

Dante allowed himself a small taste of feeling. A flash. An instant.

*Respect.*

His mind reeled. His thoughts quickened.

Lurch now moved in directly towards the old man. Riddick quickly slid behind his adversary, raising his knife high.

The old man pushed with all his might, Lurch took a few clumsy steps backwards, then advanced again.

Riddick started to bring the knife down in a deadly arc.

*Dante indulged himself for an instant to wander back through the years to a much simpler moment in time. A happy moment.*

Dante and his grandfather had spent much of their free time together fishing. Shortly before his grandfather passed away from a sudden heart attack, they sat in the shade of an old willow tree on the bank of the river they both loved so well. It would be their last fishing trip together, although neither knew it at the time. Dante was just 9 years old.

He had been recovering from an infection resulting from a particularly nasty cut on the side of his head. Nobody seemed willing to explain adequately how Dante had received that wound. His father had mumbled something about running into a door.

""What happened to your head?"" his grandfather asked gently.

Dante simply stared out across the river, tears welling up in his eyes.

“What do you want to be when you grow up Dante?” his grandfather asked with a smile, mostly to distract him. This conversation would have to wait until next time, but something had to be done.

“What *can* I be grandpa?” Dante asked wonderingly.

“You can be whatever you like.”

“I want to be *good*.” replied Dante, drying his eyes.

“You *are* good Dante. You are such a good little boy.” his grandfather reassured him.

“I want to be Batman!” Dante laughed.

“A worthy goal indeed!” laughed his grandfather. ""What would you do if you were Batman?""

*Dante had no time to dwell on that brief flash of memory, but it's effect was immediate as well as profound.*

The knife came down in it's trajectory to strike the old man in the back.

It never connected. Dante stepped from the shadows, his hand gripping Riddick's wrist and locking it in place just inches from it's intended target. Riddick struggled in Dante's grasp like a fly held by one of it's wings.

Lurch took several steps backwards, nearly tripping in the process.

“I don't think so.” Dante said very deliberately as he forced Riddick back and away from the old man.

“Holy shit.” said Barney from his position on the ground.

“Fuck this.” Lurch exclaimed, throwing the wallet into a puddle and turning away, into the darkness. Barney dragged himself to his feet and followed.

Riddick carefully sidestepped, keeping the old man between himself and Dante. He turned without a word and followed after his crew.

Dante walked to the wallet and picked it up, shaking the water from it.

“Who do I want to be?” he whispered to himself as he stood holding the man's wallet.

Realization came to him in a rush of words and images. He was more than the product of his environment! Much more. He still had a choice. There was still a chance to be what he told his grandfather long ago that he wanted to be.

He turned and handed the wallet back to the old man. Their eyes met. He saw something in those eyes he had never expected. Something that made him once again feel like that little boy fishing with his grandpa on a warm summer day.

This is the first chapter of a new story I'm writing, and I'd love any tips or critiques you may have. Thanks for reading!*

   Jake sat at his work table, a nervous itch crawling through his limbs. He ran his fingers through his hair and shook his head with a sigh. He was bouncing his leg uncontrollably, finding it impossible to concentrate on the sketch he was fleshing out on the canvas sprawled before him. Hold it together, he thought to himself, you don't need it; it's not a part of you anymore. Looking down at the medium before him, Jake realized he had absentmindedly drawn a generic superhero, cape carelessly fluttering in the wind with one arm thrust forward and a leg folded at the knee, toes pointing behind him. He shook his head, letting out an exasperated chuckle. Even when I'm working, it finds a way to remind me, he reflected. Finally he slammed down his pencil and thrust his hand into his pocket, fishing for his keys. It was close to three in the morning now and he had lasted two whole months without a problem, but now the craving was growing too strong; creeping through his mind like a smoker waiting for that next smooth hit of nicotine to keep him going. 

   He found the ring that held his collection of keys and methodically flicked through them, hastily searching for the one that would release the lock on the drawer of his desk. Finding the key he clutched it in his hand and, with a deep breath, hesitated- holding it close to his chest. He closed his eyes, fighting the urge to open the drawer he had so desperately tried to ignore for what felt like ages. He opened his eyes, feeling a bead of sweat trickle down from his temple. Looking about his home office, Jake eyed the newspaper clippings that hung on his wall, staring back at him in the dim shadows of the lamplight clamped to his desk. Some were from when he was a child, yellowing and curling at the edges, and some were much more crisp and recent. He could make out a few of the headlines: 'MASKED CRUSADER: HERO OR VILLIAN?', 'VIGILANTE STRIKES AGAIN- POLICE BAFFLED'

   Polaroid photos and Xerox copies of eye-witness sketches dotted the news reports. Pictures of a man in a gray trench coat donning black gauntlets with a matching fedora and boots, a thick utility belt around his waist, and a thick pair of goggles that glowed yellow in the dark. A brilliant yellow bird, wings outstretched and talons lurching forward, was emblazoned on the masked man's chest and coat- an emblem of good; of hope; of courage; or so Jake thought.
   But when that mysterious box arrived on his doorstep almost a year ago, with no postage or return address to be found, Jake had paid little attention to the contents held within. A joke, he thought, from a friend who had nothing better to do than ridicule him. How wrong he would be.

                                   *    *    *    *    *    *

   “Are you kidding? He's the greatest thing to ever happen to this city!”  Jake threw his arms out, gesturing at the hobby shop he and his friend were standing in, “He'll come back- he needs to. This city needs him, the world needs him!” As they flipped through miscellaneous comics, Percy shook her head in disagreement, chuckling at his statement. 

   “'The Golden Owl' is dead, Jake. In real life and in the comics. Look, right here in issue #108, 'Golden Owl vs. The Black Crusader!” Percy thrust the issue she held in her hands toward Jake, who pushed it away disapprovingly.

   “I don't believe it; I won't! Golden Owl isn't just one man, he transcends mortality; he's an ideal, a superhero who's reborn, not as the same person, but as different people, like in the comics- don't you remember issue #67?” Jake furiously rifled through the rack, searching for the comic in question, “Before the Grey Golem discovers his real identity, Hank Oswald mails the suit to Jimmy Simmons, who becomes the new 'Owl!” Percy's face contorted as she worked up a rebuttal.

   “Those are comic books, Jake, you know that. This is the real world- things like that don't happen, it's not that easy.” She paused, letting the fact sink in for a few moments. Only days before, Jake's idol- the famed vigilante known as the Golden Owl- was found dead. “It's in the news, Jake, Louis even has it framed,” Percy jerked a thumb to the  newspaper hanging over the register at the front of the store. Jake didn't need to look at it, the image of the black ink on the grey pulp was burned in his mind. The headline claiming: GOLDEN OWL MURDERED: GIFT OR CURSE? had crushed Jake's spirits, and still hurt him when he saw it. 

   “Maybe he'll come back, or maybe that wasn't the real Owl, or- or...” Jake couldn't believe it, he wouldn't. The Golden Owl had been a hero for decades. No one knew who he was, or how he had managed to create the technology behind his costume- If it could even be called a costume, Jake thought to himself, with all the gizmos and gadgets that he used on a regular basis- or how he always seemed to transcend the ravages of time and age. 
   As a kid, Jake would dress up as the hero for Halloween or even just around the house, 'whooshing' through the kitchen and 'klak-kla-klaking' his imaginary Tesla rifle into his hand with a dreamed-up series of  gears, levers and pulleys hidden in his bedsheet of a coat, blasting bad guys and rescuing the hopeless cat from the laundry basket prison. Hope faded from Jake's heart when he saw the headline staring back at his from his doorstep the day after the Owl's apparent murder. If the world could manage to take the life of a man who lived to fight evil, a man who spent his nights keeping the city safe, what was there left to hope for?

   Jake shook his head of the cynical feelings that were rising up in him. He looked up at Percy, who was watching him with her soft gaze, concern gently echoing in her look.

   “I know he was your hero...” She laid her hand on top of his, seeing the sadness in his eyes, “Who knows? Maybe you're right, maybe there will be another one. Maybe there's already been a few different Golden Owls that we don't even know about, like in the comics.” She gave him a hopeful smirk, her copper red hair falling in front of her face. Jake smiled wearily, admiring her beauty.

   “Let's get out of here,” he suggested, laying down the comics before him and reaching for his coat, “I've got to get home and finish that sales pitch tonight for Mr. Harrison.” With that, the two of them walked out of Heroes Hideout and hailed a cab.

   After dropping off Percy, Jake had rerouted the cab to his own apartment a few streets up. As the driver maneuvered through the lights, Jake peered out the window, wondering when on Earth he would work up the gall to ask that girl out. They had friends for years, and now 'friends' wasn't enough to describe his growing feelings for her. Before he had a chance to ponder anymore, the cabbie halted outside his building. Jake handed him a wad of cash, waving away the change and thanking the driver. He briskly walked to the entrance of the Stratton Flats building and smiled to the doorman, who welcomed him by name as he pulled open the thick red door with a single gloved hand. He passed the lobby and was hailed by the new desk attendant, whose name he hadn't remembered yet. 

   “A package for you, Mr. Harvey.” She declared as she heaved a medium sized box onto the counter. 
“Who delivered it?” Jake asked curiously; he wasn't expecting any packages.

The young girl shook her head, “He wouldn't say, just kept kept saying it was urgent and 'for your eyes only'” She did her best 'secret spy' impression and pushed the box toward Jake, who lifted it from the counter and lumbered toward the elevator.

   The double doors of the elevator opened onto the fifteenth floor and Jake Harvey sauntered to his apartment, juggling the heavy box in one arm as he fumbled his his keys, searching for the right one. He unlocked the door, cool air spilling over him as he set the box down onto the desk in his drawing room. Reaching for a nearby pocket knife he cut open box and folded out the flaps, pulling out crumpled batches of butcher paper he could only assume were used to cushion the contents within. As he discarded the last of the paper he stepped back in shock.

   There before him, neatly packed on top of another bundle of brown paper, sat a pair of yellow tinted goggles looped around the brim of a gray hat. A notecard was tucked into the hat's brim. Jake grabbed the note gently, as if trying not to alarm the boxes contents. Inside the folded piece of paper was a simple note: 

        Though the man has passed, the idea must live on. 
    The choice is yours, Mr. Harvey

         -Golden Owl

A bit of background, I'm 22 and figuring out what I want to do now I've finished university. I've always loved writing, but I've always been afraid of not being good enough to do it. I'm definitely looking to improve, hence posting this here and over in r/writing.

---------------------------------------

There is nothing as quiet as Death. He creeps silently through the tunnels, constantly hunting us down, constantly keeping us on the run in this subterranean labyrinth. We’ve been forced to make our home here in this sprawling subway system, once a busy transport system for the former inhabitants of this world, now a refuge, lying dormant beneath a shattered city. Doesn’t matter anymore. It’s just us left here now. Us and Death.

“Charlotte?”

I heard the small voice calling me from the other side of the room. It was a tiny space, tucked into a corner of a quiet station on what was once the Piccadilly Line, and it had been home for longer than any of the other temporary places we had settled.

“Charlotte, are you there?” It was Timmy.

“Hang on a second,” I whispered back, “I’m taking a piss.”

I made my way to him, feeling my way through the junk and debris on the floor to find him in the only lit area of the room. In the flickering lantern light, his dirty face peeked out from the top of his thin blanket. Timmy was a lot younger than me, maybe half my age, but with nobody around to keep track of time, it was impossible to know for sure.

“What do you want?” I asked.

“How long are we going to stay here?”

“As long as it’s safe. As long as he doesn’t know where we are.”

I could feel Timmy tense in fear at the mere mention of him.

“He scares me” he admitted eventually.

“I know. And I’ll do whatever I can to protect you from him.”

“Okay.”

Timmy was silent as he rolled over in bed. I extinguished the lantern and lay next to him. Without the flame, the room was cast into total darkness. In the underground, it’s perpetually night. The neon lights of the stations had long gone out, never to come back on. Even with a working light there’s not much to see. The stations are all smashed tiles and cracked linoleum, and the tunnels are miles of tracks, snaking outwards into the black, never to be used again. We still use lanterns and the occasional torch to see by, but carefully, and only when we’re awake.

It’s not safe to keep the lights on while we’re asleep. He’ll see it and find us. And Death will follow him.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_wo9no,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/wo9no/all_of_deaths_children_chapters_one_and_two/,

There is a rebellion beginning to form in the lower parts of the capitol city around the idea that a mundane monarch cannot rule over a magical world with any kind of authority. The whisperings have just started, though and not a single group has taken form because nobody can agree on who should rule in the king’s place or even of mundane and sorcerer kind should be ruled as one body.
Meanwhile the king has become unfit and paranoid in his old age. He’s developed a magic of his own but it’s not the flashy magic that most people can now wield, it’s a subtle psionic power to manipulate people to do what he wants them to. Those who are closest to him are the most susceptible to the effects. His daughter has also developed a talent for magic. She’s got very powerful fire controlling abilities.  In order to keep the kingdom his own the king cooks up a scheme to get rid of all of the other sorcerers in the kingdom.  
Under his control, the king sends his daughter to create magical mischief and mayhem to incite terror in the population. This divided the magical and mundane communities.  But while she is out on one of these errands for her father a ship captain, who is also a sorcerer, catches her in the act. At first he is not even aware that she is the princess but when he brings her away on his ship the father from the capitol they get the more her father loses his grip on her.
The princess is disoriented at first but after figuring everything out, and not without incident, she decided to champion the Sorcerers’ cause and head a full-fledged rebellion against the king. She has rights to take the throne and wants to do it with as little violence as possible but can she do it when her father knows her mind so well?

First, the boss yelled at me for coming to work late, then I found out there's a rumor going around about me having syphilis. Plus I'm pretty sure the new guy in the cubicle next to me is that serial rapist from all over the news. Yes, things were off to a bumpy start, so when my break came, I was willing to do anything to relieve the monotony.

That's when I felt a squirt gun shot hit the back of my neck.

I whirled around in my seat, and standing behind me was a man in an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt, with a wife beater underneath that had BONER written across it in sharpie. He was wearing an upside-down green visor that was turned sideways, and pumping a super soaker.
 
“Dude, got you,” he said. “That's freaking awesome. And you didn't even see it coming!” 

Irritated, I rubbed the back of my neck. “Is this urine?”

He laughed. “Hey man,” he said. “You look really bored . How about a funny list or two? Nobody's watching.”

I shrugged. “Meh.”

“Oh come on,” he said. “It won't take too long. Just real quick, while nobody's looking?”

I thought about it for a second, weighing the pros and cons. It had been a while, so I gave it a shot. “Alright, yeah,” I said. “Whatever. But make it fast.”

Cracked.com took a deep breath, and stood up straight. “Okay,” he said. “Check this out. The other day I heard about these six guys who cheated death right in its douchebag face, and kicked its freaking ass. Want to hear about that? It's pretty funny.”

I thought about it, then shook my head. “Eh, no. I don't think so. What else you got?” 

He scratched his chin for a moment, then snapped his fingers. “Alright,” he said. “I got it. Five birds with insane mating calls that will blow your freaking mind. Interested?”
 
I sighed. ""Yeah, I guess I'll do that one. Wait, are you just a list site now?”

Cracked.com cleared his throat, stood up straight, and held up a picture of a bird. “This one is the New Zealand Wysteria Jay. Its mating call sounds like the guitar solo from 'Sunshine of Your Love,' by Eric Clapton.”

“So?”

“So? Think about it. Isn't that freaking crazy?” 

I shrugged apathetically. “I don't know, kinda, I suppose. What else you got?”

He dropped the picture on the ground and held up another one. “Okay, this is a brown Connecticut Swallow. The sonic vibrations from its mating call can help treat long-term depression in termites, and some breeds of possum.”

“Okay, and?”

""Think about it. Isn't that freaking crazy?”

That's when I noticed the little black text beneath the picture. I looked at the stack of other pictures underneath his arm. Each one had the same captions. “Wait, what's that?” I pointed.

“Oh, that's one of the captions I put on my pictures. Little black text, beneath each picture.”

“You use the same style of captions over and over for every picture?” I asked.

“Eventually you might think it's funny again.”

I groaned and pinched between my eyes. This was not going well. I was considering just doodling penises in MSPAINT, and making that my whole break. But I was bored enough to continue. “Okay,"" I said. ""So what does the next bird do?” 

“Alright, listen to this: it hypnotizes you into buying it bird seed.”

I crossed my arms. “Alright.”

His grin widened. “Think about it, isn't that freaking crazy?”

I held up my hand. “Alright, hold it right there. Before the next one, tell me. Is this all of your lists? Just a bunch of facts, then explanations of what my reaction should be with the word 'freaking' a lot?"" 

“Yep.”

“Well, are these written by a computer or something?”

He shook his head. “No, people actually write them. But listen, I've got a list of six video game fan theories that will change your opinion of Nazi Germany. It's insane.” 

I threw my hands up in the air. “Jesus Christ!” I shouted. “This is all the same shit over and over again! Alright, I'm done with this. Never again. Go away please.”

“Want to see a video? It's six minutes long.”

I fumed. “Get the hell out of here, and don't come back! I'll just stick to my other websites from now on. Go on, get lost!”

But as Cracked.com walked away, I heard an audible chuckle. “What?” he said. “All three of them? You'll be back.”

So do you know a place I can submit these short stories to have them published and or recognized so that I can continue to work on them to make one complete book?

Basically the series I have been thinking about is a story about the fight for the criminal underworld and the other families, gangs and factions involved. There is no real main character and will constantly be switching between characters and places to explain the whole story. Before writing I am going to draw up a massive spider web chart, explaining all the characters in detail and how each faction is connected and their connections to each other, in past and present detail. Would that be the best way to start off my novel? This ofcourse wouldn't go in the series but would just be a guiding hand for me so I can project the story better. Do you believe that would be the best way to go about something so large?

From what I have said is there any tips you can give me or info in general?

Flair can be enabled or disabled by the user (so no one will see it if you don't want them to) in the left hand sidebar.  If you have earned multiple flair designations, you can pick your favorite to display to the subreddit.

Flair will be recalculated each Saturday on a rolling basis (i.e. for the last 28 days).  Eventually I'll automate the process through a python script that runs daily.

We also have plans to give out custom flair for writing contests, etcetra coming up.

I want to know if i should focus on other career choices now before it becomes too late. Below is a short part of a short story I'm working on. I don't care if you read just a paragraph or a line but if you do please comment. I could use the help. Here goes.

THE STORY: The steam gradually filled into the station like a fog, until, when the time came for my train to arrive, and my ticket to be called, I could hardly see my way through enough to find the deep black door. “You couldn’t hit the broad side of a barnyard!” The ghost of Brian miller chanted in my head, once again dragging the desperately unwanted past into my field of vision, like a rock in a field of flowers. ""You’re as blind as a bat!"" I shook the voice off. It was wrong anyway, he always had been. I never had trouble seeing things that were there, it was seeing things that weren’t that I had trouble with. I shivered, stepping aboard the passenger train. But that was long ago, much too long ago to be worrying about it now.
   
   I found my cabin quickly, number 31, but decided to wander around for a time, maybe get to know some of the other passengers, maybe some of the crew. After all, we were going to be with each other for the next ten days, were we not? We might as well get to know each other early. I know that I was probably, no, definitely the first one aboard, - I had been waiting since four – and decided to greet them at the nearest door, the one I came in through. I was excited as I anticipated the trip, a ten day venture that began in Seattle and would end in Berff Canada. But it wasn’t the end destination that even mattered. When you’re in 2012, riding a Steam engine is always about the journey, the people, the novelty of it all. It was a ride where you found Americans speaking in British accents, - whether they mean to or not – the most expensive of suits, ties, maybe even a monocle for the extravagant, and an absolute repugnance of modern technology. 
    
   I had been saving up for this trip for years, every month putting away an insignificant portion of my income into a small Jar, which I had stored under my bed at first, but once my goal became more plausible switching it to a spot under the floorboards, safer from robbers and the like. At first, for months in the beginning I had thought of it as a pipe dream, a far off goal that kept me from going crazy and giving up, almost like an equivalent of a Christian’s heaven. When I had finally had enough for the ticket, which covered food, laundry, and sleeping quarters, you can understand why I had arrived five hours early. If I had missed this train I would have never forgiven myself.

Please bear with me here, I don't have much writing experience.

* Story: Earth was a biological resource farm built by another alien race that was abandoned, letting humans come to life. The aliens, realising that Earth still has valuable resources to harvest, invades in the last days of World War One.

 It is unknown how humans could have defended themselves from such an advanced species. It is currently 1967, and the main character is one of the surviving members of a group of people that had extraordinary endurance to gunfire and the harsh wasteland that came after the invasion. His city was attacked in the invasion, and a bomb spontaneously killed and resurrected everyone within a mile radius.

 These people do not die of old age, but they can be killed. Most of them were killed off within the first few years due to stupidity and greed. He are currently searching for the legendary REX, the object responsible for human consciousness, intelligence and free thought.

William Porter was of this earth but not of this time. The world as he knew it had yet to be created, not for another 1,000 years would the world evolve into what we hoped and dreamed for. But lying in wait, the foundation stood all around him. He could hardly remember Earth in 1,000 years’ time. The faces of his own family seemed so foreign and lost in his mind. Years of traveling had made William Porter an old man. He had seen the whole of creation and the destruction of time itself. He had eaten dinner on a planet untouched by man with the love of his life and then watched the sun set in the 16th century. 
 
 William’s mind was elsewhere as he packed the fresh dirt around the last peonies of the bunch. Standing up, he brushed the dirt of his jeans and admired his work. Never did he think he would find solace in gardening. The thought made him laugh as he found a seat in the shade of the patio. The mid July heat was bearable but never overpowering with the sun starting to stretch past the neighboring houses. Sitting brought temporary relief to his aching joints. William’s wife, Maggie, was out and wouldn’t be home till later. William only had Bonnie, his yellow lab to keep him company. She came running at the sound of his low chuckle and rubbed up against his leg. Almost out of reach he scratched the top of her head like she liked. “Hey girl. How’d I do?” he said getting up to make a drink. It would be his 5th glass of Bourbon.

November 16, 2013:

The first reports of the infection began pouring in from China. The government said it was just a rare strain of the rabies virus causing people to attack one another. 
This put the public on edge, but Drakes family began to prepare for the worst.

December 8, 2013:

The infection spread across all of Asia and Europe. At least that’s what we assumed at first since all reports stopped from those continents. Flights stopped coming in and most flights stopped coming back. The flights that did comeback reported that the airports were overrun with infected. Drakes family began stockpiling.

December 14, 2013:

The U.S. Government sealed off the borders. No one could leave or come in. Drakes family moved into their cabin in the woods.

February 13, 2014:

The infection spread to all but the United States. Drakes family ran out of their supplies.

March 3, 2014:

Borders between the U.S and Canada were overrun and the infection began to move south. While Drake was out hunting his family killed his older sister, cooked and ate her. When Drake returned he was told that his sister had left. Drake began to prepare himself for the worst.

April 5, 2014:

The world became completely infected by this time. Drakes parents turned on him, but Drake killed them before they could kill him. He immediately packed up and began searching for survivors.

June 11, 2020:
Drake gave up all hope trying to find survivors. He focused on just trying to survive on his own.

May 20, 2022:
Drake set up camp in the penthouse of an abandoned apartment building in N.Y.C.

But it wasn’t a smile, not really, it was the bearing of teeth that the bayed animal must show. “That makes one of us.”
 	And I stepped out of the carriage*.

(*Note: I'll apologise if this is hard to read. I copied it straight from word and some things are a little messed up*.) 	
    

With the Iron Guard you had to be precise. It took a heavy hand and a good swing to cut them down first go, anything else and you’d only make a dent in their pretty grey armour. 
There were three of them left guarding the bank. You might think that two to three aren’t bad odds, but when it comes to the Guard, coming at them with less than a small army is asking for trouble.
 Well trained? Certainly. Clever? We’d see.
 	
The one stood in the middle looked like the highest rank among those who’d stayed. Tall as Jeres, almost, but not as muscled. A long red beard hung out from his half helm, and his eyes fixed on mine as I took the five or so steps over to him. He held his great pike crossed over his chest, ready to use it if need be. I tossed a glance over my shoulder. Jeres stood perhaps three paces back.
He’d decided to follow me after all. Whether it was the promise of loot, or a newfound fear of me I didn’t know. And I didn’t much care. He was there, and that’s all that mattered in the end.
 	
“State your name and business.” Redbeard grunted. Professional, detached. “Just doing his job,” Trent used to say. “No need to hurt thems that’s just doing their job.” He had a kind heart, did Trent, back before I’d chased it out of him with years of living wrong. Fortunately for me, I possessed nothing of the kind.
 	
With a high pitched yipping yell I bounced forward in attack. Redbeard’s eyes widened slightly as I went, but true to the training of the Guard he raised his pike to stop my advance. He’d thought it over when he pushed the pointed end into my chest, millimetres from my left nipple. I saw ghost of the victor’s smile tug at the corner of his lips. He’d thought it over when the pike sunk through the folds of my travel cloak, when it pierced the dark shirt beneath.
 	
His smile faltered and died when his pikehead hit the steel breastplate I wore under my shirt. 
I flashed him the same grin I’d done Jeres in the carriage, except this time I’d not have mercy. The surprise made it easier to wrench the pike from his vice-like grip. Not easy, but easier.
With two hands wrapped around the weapon, I lunged for his throat. He saw it coming, of course, and brought his arms up in an X shape, the pikehead in the space between his hands. Instead of spearing him through the throat, I glanced the tip of his helmet, causing it to slip from his head and land softly in the sand beneath our feet. 
 	
I dropped the pike as his right hand shot down to the longsword worn on his hip. I stepped up on his great steel boot, and with some strength drove my little knife into his eye. He lurched back and forth once or twice, before falling like a bag of wet meal, his blood painting the white sand a myriad of colour. I bent to collect my knife from his eye socket. It made a loud slurping noise, and goo ran between my fingers. Turning, I found Jeres where I thought him to be. His gun in his bandaged hand. The other two Iron Guardsmen dead before him.
   	
“Better be loot.” He grumbled as he pushed passed me, and into the bank.

	
I drew one of my own guns as we passed through the sand scoured doors, and fired a single shot into the air.
“Best keep your heads down, ladies and gentlemen!” I shouted, my grin back. “Lest you want a new hole to breath from. Won’t be doing much breathing, though.” There were perhaps a dozen people going about their business in the bank. Various ages, I spotted a man with Death’s hand close to his shoulder ready to lead him off, and I caught the sound of a lad around eight giggling.
 	
Jeres filed them into the rectangular waiting area, his gun in his hand and a foul look worn on his face. I took a moment to scan the mob before me. To their credit, not one looked afraid. Confused and annoyed, but not afraid. Not even the bairn, who stared out at me with a look of morbid curiosity.
	
""Now,” I barked, standing at the head of the crowd. “You may have guess that we’re here to steal some things. But these things ain’t worth dying over. Make no mistake, get in our way, try to be the hero, and I’ll let him kill you,” I stuck a thumb over my shoulder, pointing at Jeres. “And he’s a might pissed off at the moment, so it won’t be painless either.” It didn’t take much to cow a crowd if you knew what you were doing. My Father understood this, and as a boy I’d watch him push around men he had no right to. Dangerous men. And at the end of the day, after one of his speeches, they’d be his.

The trick is not to intimidate too much. Too much violence, too many threats of death, and they’ll convince themselves that no matter what they do, they’ll leave in a body bag. This means less co-operation, and slows down the job.
	
I turned and stepped up to Jeres, until we were almost nose to nose.
“Watch them,” I said softly. “And don’t hurt a one till we’re done here.”
Then I was off to find the teller. It didn’t take long, mind you, since tellers are predictable. One busted lock through to the not-so-heavily secured employee only area and I found him blubbering, a corded phone playing the dead ring in his lap. Blue button up shirt under a dark knitted vest. He was short and of average build, but an affront to the eye. His forehead was three sizes too big for his face, and his weak jaw stuck out like that of a dolphin. A messy tuft of greying brown hair plastered to him with sweat.
	
 “Now, now.” I took a scolding tone, wrapping one hand around the scruff of his shirt, pulling up and shoving him roughly against the wall. “I’ll only hurt ya’ if you run, or do something stupid. How’s about you tell me your name, and I’ll tell you mine?” A warm smile helped move this one along.

“S…Simon.” He stammered. “And you?”

 “Robbin.” I replied, letting go of his shirt, straightening it out where I’d wrinkled it.

 “Robbin what?”

 “A bank, at the moment.” 

 Sometimes some light humour helps, too.

 “What do you want?” 

 “For you to open the vault, Simon.”

 “I…I can’t do that.” A little bravery, that surprised me.

 “I see,” I eyed him a moment, before taking his right hand in mine. “And how many fingers does it take to open 
the vault?”

 “It’s…an old model. So…one, Mister.”

 “That’s what I thought.” And I took his thumb from him. It’s not an easy task, taking a finger. I’ve found the best way is to break it before you cut, less bone to saw through. 
	
Simon howled. Nothing human about it. A high pitched yell of pure agony. It was reminiscent of a horse with a broken leg, or a dog who’s paw you've trampled under you.

“W…What are you doing?” He sobbed, voice hoarse.

“Well, Simon. You got nine fingers now. That’s eight more than you need to open the feckin’ vault!” I shouted, spraying spittle in his face. “And I’ll take another one for every minute you’re not leading me to it!” There was a quick pause as Simon tried his best to suppress another wave of pain. He didn’t manage it, though, and I felt a spasm move up him.

“I…I can’t.”

I tightened my grip on his hand once again, felt him try and pull away. He wanted it done. He wanted the pain to vanish. I kept my grip tight as he attempted to wriggle free.
	 
Simon wasn’t willing to give me what I wanted, and so I held him there. I held him in that space between hope and dread. If you’ve ever been too far underwater you know what I’m on about. That point where you see the sunlight through the waves. Your lungs burn, and you want nothing more than to suck in a deep breath of air, but to do so would be death. It’s pain, propelling yourself that last few feet to break the surface, and you’d prefer to give up. To float. To let the water into your lungs and drown there in amongst the reeds and the fish.
	
Hold a man too tight and he’ll fight you. Too loose and he’ll see your weakness and raise you trouble. But hold him just enough and he’ll bend to you. He’ll break every oath he ever swore. Forsake every vow he made.
Perhaps Simon had decided to give in, perhaps he hadn’t. It made little difference to me, I wasn’t the one under the knife.

“What say you, Simon my boy?” I clapped a hand to his soft bicep, startling him with the contact and sudden noise.
 	
Simon looked up at me, eyes wide, tear filled and red raw. Snot and gunge dripped form his beaked nose. Pleading. 
“I…I can’t.” He said it softly. Another man, a decent man, might have walked away. Put down the knife and skipped town. Forgot about the money just this once.
But I was not a decent man, and I acted accordingly.
	

This time I took his middle finger. Twisting and sawing just as before.

**CHAPTER 1.** 

**THE POSTCARD.** 

***I can’t stand postcards.*** Every time I see one, I remember my life before I got out. We used to have images like these. Mostly artificial ones. All second-hand. Photographs, paintings. Holograms. Higher quality than any of the printed images that have filled my mailbox over the summer, yet it does not even come close to feeling the grass under your feet, hearing the wind in the trees. They were nothing tangible. Nothing that ever felt real to me. Postcards remind me of that. Even today, whenever I see these pictures of places I have never been, I let the doubt creep in. This is just an image of a landscape on a card. This place might not exist. Everything around me might not exist. This is the doubt I was born and the doubt that was born in me within the confined, padded, ascepticised walls of the Enclosure. 

From the outside, there was next to nothing to see. The few parts we kept above ground, the vents, the sensors, the cameras, had conveniently been camouflaged. Even though the paint was starting to come off, the untrained eye could never have spotted us. The living quarters had thin, tinted window sealed, with reinforced glass. The only sun we ever saw was coming out of these vertical arrow slits. We had essentially buried ourselves in this installation on the most inhospitable spot of the planet. Hidden from the surface was succession of rooms kept so clean they were fit for surgery, spanning kilometers in all directions, over dozens of levels. Thousands of us lived here, constantly expanding, swarming through the corridors like ants digging galleries. 

The place started out as a kind of base, or so we had been told. It seems that at some point in History, people attempted to control this barren piece of wasteland with the ground so hot nothing would grow. We knew better. We just hid here, where no one would ever come for us. All of this had happened a long time ago. Since then, we have come to our senses. The days when we rigged the area with landmines and had sensors pointing in all directions are gone. “They probably still work.” My instructor conceded once. Then he laughed. “Not that anyone is going to trigger them any time soon.”

From my dormitory window, I had one view and one view only. Even with the seasons, it never changed. Nothing ever moved. No animal would ever venture into this territory. And of course, no people. After all, there were no other people left.

I know what my classmates are thinking. I know why my mailbox is full of letters from people I have never spoken to. *How is your summer going? Have you ever been to the Dossen beach? When I come back, I can teach you this new knot I learned.*

I am a sensation, a specimen who might as well have landed here from another planet. And so, threats surround me. Not emanating from them, of course, but from this whole situation. I see them softly watching over me, like sentinels passing me by, orbiting at a mindful distance. They visualize a bubble of private space and trail me without stepping in uninvited. I know they fear for me. From isolation to suffocation, from alienation to aggression, too much attention is just as dangerous as too little. They are trying to make me feel like I am a part of something without overwhelming me. They want me to think I belong, to prevent me from feeling like the little black duckling in this pack of immaculate swans.

These people are full of assumptions. They *assume* I must be lonely. They *assume* I want to connect. They try. They send me postcards. I cannot possibly hold it against them. Their intentions are commendable, no doubt about it. Besides, no one knows me well enough to know that I hate photos, pictures, and most of all, those fucking postcards. I know it matters somehow, but when I had a chance to open my mouth, I didn’t. Not that I am being spiteful or ungrateful. Honestly, I have no idea how they manage to connect with others in the way they do. When something bothers them, they just know how to phrase it. *I don’t really like postcards. I’d rather get a phone call or something, that’d be nice.* It seems so natural when they do it, but it would never occur to me.

My interest in this world, my drive, my resolve, are just too different from theirs. No part of it is organic, social, personal. It never involved touching, laughing or sharing. It had more to do with fractals, rhythm and principles. Which is why postcards get under my skin. They remind me that images, and the people who show them to me, cannot be trusted. As evidence, they have next to no value.

For the longest time, I believed what we were told, that we were locked in to protect ourselves from the outside. It made sense, then. After all, no one could survive on such desolate land. You would have to be mentally ill to try to step out of the Enclosure, it was as foolish as dipping your foot in burning lava. The truth was we were captives, sentenced to this prison by our own good judgement. The keys were in our hands, but we chose to stay.

The real reason we were here was to shield the world from us. ",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1k4drj,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1k4drj/feedback_scorched_earth_chapter_1_scifi_921_words/,

Reading H.P. Lovecraft and watching *Pacific Rim* really got me inspired to create a world in which a Titan, tens of kilometers high, awakes from a long period of dormancy and starts wandering the Earth. It has no malicious goal, but in its size destroys everything in its path since even our tallest buildings are inconsequential to it. Humans have no capability to stop it and eventually learn to just predict its course and evacuate before it arrives, rebuilding after it has trampled everything in the way. It moves very slowly and not in a straight line, so trampled areas are unlikely to be hit again for centuries.

This introduction is the start to a series of short stories telling tales of this Titan in various styles. A researcher several million years in the future, after humanity has colonized the galaxy, collects various accounts of the Titan over the long age of its wandering.

Hope you find it as interesting as I do!

**Edit:** Here's an inline text version, if you'd prefer that.

---

It is June of Earth Year 2,840,241, and the mountains slumber as the people of Earth continue to rebuild in their footsteps. Thirty years ago, the Titan, a colossal entity formerly thought to be nothing but the creation of Earth’s shifting continents, entered a dormant state that we have since concluded as the dawn of a new age of rest. The humans remaining on the planet rebuild as they always have, this time with the hope of setting up more permanent residence.

My life has been dedicated to the collection of interesting pieces of art and scientific intrigue related to the Titan. As I grow older, currently a ripe age of 230, I fear I am losing the unwavering vigor in my search for these artifacts. What I have gathered in these pages is a microcosm of Earth’s humans’ cultural and scientific history from the Awakening to the New Age of Slumber. Humanity’s reach has become so vast over the eons that, while records still exist in permanent digital archives, it is impossible to find everything available. The Internet and even the Lunar Data Archives have become so bloated that, without knowing exactly what to look for, a data hunter can spend his entire life digging through useless paperwork without finding anything important. Modern files follow a strict organizational pattern, but only an expert can hope to recover anything valuable from centuries and millenniums past. I happen to be an expert, having earned esteemed degrees in Data History and Anthropology in addition to spending most of my life studying the Titan. This galactic sector, Sol, draws a high number of digital archaeologists like me due to its significance as homeworld of humanity and, of course, the home of the Titan. No doubt many others are working on similar projects, and most will continue for years to come. Like I mentioned before, however, I am too old to keep building my collection. My anthology will likely be among the first published and (I say with a certain air of bravado and pride) the most comprehensive. I intend for this collection not only to educate and entertain those vastly removed from the workings of Earth but also to further aid in the research of the archaeologists who continue to search for pieces lost in the digital slush.

I have done my best to translate the archaic languages of Earth to the universal galactic tongue. In an odd sort of way, these languages were more complex, more beautiful than our own, but orders of magnitude less efficient. I took great care to preserve the original meanings of these documents, but in cases where our contemporary efficiency has stricken unnecessary words from our vocabulary, some intent may have been lost in translation. In cases of audio logs and video recordings, oftentimes the various dialects of Old Earth would make certain words and phrases completely unintelligible. Some included transcripts are broken and have pieces missing. While the overall messages remain intact, much has been lost simply due to my inability to decipher or find someone to decipher these strange accents. Nevertheless, it is with great tedium and care that I have sifted through these relics in order to bring the galactic society an honest and thorough recollection of the Age of the Titan. I have provided references to the identity and location of each original document. Perhaps, in the future, someone with the necessary skills can complete these segmented logs.

We can only assume that the Titan’s slumber is temporary in cosmic terms. A creature of such magnitude, having wandered for nearly three million years with little rest, may experience the same sort of circadian rhythms we humans utilize, but on an unimaginable scale. While still unproven, evidence favors the theory that the Titan has gone through cycles of wandering and dormancy since, we must assume, the creation of Earth. It is the first and oldest life on the planet. Reasonable and cautious assumption states that the Titan will continue its cycle for the coming eons, at least until Sol consumes the Earth.

For this reason I hope that my documentation stands the test of time on Earth. I can not pretend to know what Earth will be like in another three million years. It is wildly different now than it was when the Titan first awoke, as I have discovered in my research. It will surely be transformed by age once again, bizarre and alien to modern eyes. If humans still inhabit Earth the next time the Titan awakes from its slumber, they need to be prepared. Hopefully this anthology, and the works of my colleagues, will serve as adequate briefing for the next cycle. With no regard for those who may occupy the planet with it, the Titan will rise again. The Earth truly belongs to this marvelous Wanderer. With preparation, humanity can thrive with it in relative harmony.

Part 1: Fateful Night! The Power of the Witching Hour?

Chapter 1: Introducing…

Moonlight paints the city streets in cool silver. Silence adds to the texture of a small town. The roads are clean and for the moment free of traffic. The barren trees are a constant reminder of November's presence. It is a world asleep. Upon this witching hour though three figures move through the moon bathed streets of their almost urban like town of Lakeview, New York. Only a few minutes from the city of Buffalo, the town has become an extension of that city.

Laughter in the alto octave shatters the silent city for a moment. Its owner is a dark haired girl of about fifteen. A long, carefully constructed, braid falls into her face, swinging with each step. Acid washed jeans form to her hips with the help of an elaborate belt, a sharp contrast of color on her pale skin and purple long sleeved shirt. Her footsteps are soft thanks to her well worn sneakers. Eyes twinkle in the moonlight as she takes each confident step.

The laughter of the first girl is answered by the sweet voice of another. She is tall for her age and gender. Ginger colored hair perfectly compliments her stunning bright green eyes. Fashionable clothing allows her to breathe confidence without words. Her grey shirt is cut in a fashionable way that reveals just enough while still retaining class. Around her neck is a hand knitted purple scarf. It blows ever so slightly in the wind. She clutches the muscular arm of the third companion.

He is all smiles through his perfectly white teeth. His muscles breath power through his white t-shirt, honed on the football field and in his school's weight room. Around his neck is the distinct symbol of yin-yang. The holy white invades the dark semi circle only to be flanked in their eternal struggle. In particular he likes the spots of intruding black in the white and vice versa. To him the necklace seems to symbolize his life perfectly. He says another joke, smiling at the thought of making his two friends laugh. His dark hair and eyes soften considerably when the red haired girl grabs his arm tighter. Sweat rolls down his Jamaican skin but he coolly hides it. Atop his head rests a black and white fedora, a souvenir of the party they had just left. Even being out alone at the Witching Hour he feels secure. With his arms, he silently tells himself, he will protect his friends if something were to happen.

""Ok so tell me the story one more time Alec,"" The dark haired girl asks with a smile, ""You were dancing and you just happened to give Joe a nose bleed?""

""Hey I didn't know he was behind me,"" Alec says in his defense, ""But when That's What Makes You Beautiful comes on you know that it can get a little crazy. So I swung my arm back and Joe was just standing there behind me. Next thing I know he's on the ground, still singing along with a bloody nose. Mind you, he's half dazed by this point.""

The red haired girl holding his arm shakes at the mention of blood, ""Alec it was horrible. I thought he was going to pass out or something.""

""He should have known better than to get in the way of Alec and One Direction."" The dark haired girl says with a wink, ""You like them a little too much for a boy Alec. Maybe Holly should be worried?"" The dark haired girl gives a faux concerned look to her friend.

""Jealous that I have such an effeminate boyfriend Katie?"" Holly teases whilst sticking out her tongue.

""She's jealous that she doesn't have one at all,"" Alec jokes with his red haired love, ""Maybe if she would just let her hair down a bit she wouldn't scare away every boy that tried to talk to her.""

""Well excuse me if my response to pick up lines is 'I'm a black belt.' I personally think that it is an interesting conversation point.""

The three friends laugh at each other and themselves. Above their heads the streetlights flicker ever so slightly. The pulse of the city spikes, and returns to normal. The three teens are unaware of any of this however. Their eyes focus on the road ahead of them. The wind picks up in ferocity for a few seconds and Alec feels a stone drop into his stomach.

""Does anything feel off about tonight?"" Alec questions his friends while looking around casually, ""Something seems, weird.""

Katie closes her eyes for a second takes a deep breath. It was a motion that Alec knows very well as Katie was known for doing it before every karate tournament. He can see her ears twitch slightly as she tries to pick up on even the faintest sound. Alec and Holly watch her but do not say a word. Slowly Katie begins to open her eyes.

""Nope, nothing!"" Katie says with such confidence that Alec almost doubles over.

""How can you be so sure?"" He challenges.

""Because you're just hearing things again.""

""I really do think something weird is going on tonight,"" Alec protests, looking towards Holly for support, ""You believe me right?""

""Well it is sort of late,"" Holly agrees while looking at her phone, ""Maybe your mind is just playing tricks on you.""

Alec lets the topic drop and they continue walking towards their homes. The closer they get however the more the street lights begin to flicker. Constantly little moments of darkness engulf the trio. Soon his sweat begins to grow cold, despite his friend's assurance that it was all in his head.

They stop at a street corner for a moment. As Alec and Holly begin to cross the street Katie stays back, staring at her cell phone. She holds it up towards the moon. In an effort to get it even higher she stands on her toes.

""Um, Katie you ok?"" Holly asks while checking her own phone.

Katie brings her phone down to normal height and puts it in her pocket slowly, ""Yeah I just lost signal there for a minute.""

""That's what you get for having a second rate service,"" Alec jokes, subconsciously checking his phone. It beeps once to indicate no service before jumping back to four bars. ""Holly did…""

""Yeah mine lost its signal too for a minute there,"" Holly tells them, worry creeping into her voice, ""Maybe it's just a dead zone?""

""A satellite passing over our heads,"" Katie offers as an explanation, ""Just normal first world problems.""

They all agree to this and begin to walk with more urgency back to their neighborhood. Now Alec can see street lamps flicker on and off. In his pocket his phone constantly vibrates with each loss of signal. As if God had to play on their nerves more a faint rustling sound can be heard from the buildings to their right. As they pass by the structures, the trio can hear a faint thud.

Now on full alert Alec begins to scan the darkness ahead of him. Besides the slight swaying of trees in the wind nothing jumps out at him. The scratch of a sneaker on concrete causes him to turn around immediately. When nothing materializes from the darkness he mentally slaps himself for being an idiot.

""The Witching hour huh?"" Katie asks Alec with her coy smile, ""Making you jumpy Mr. Football star?""

""Katie I really think something is following us and I would appreciate it if you would not make fun of me right now."" Alec berates his friend and returns to looking for the source of every noise that reaches his ears.

Looking to the building to his right he sees something glimmer and disappear. For the briefest second a shadow appears to be looking down at him. From his perspective the figure appears to be a long lanky shade. It is human in shape but the lack of light begins to play with his mind. The figure appears to tilt its head but Alec can not define it with a defiant description due to the shadows playing with him. Staring back at him are a pair of questioning, focused, red eyes.

""Up there!"" Alec yells while pointing to the shadow's location. The two girls turn and their eyes follow his finger. Alec can not help but smile at Holly and Katie with an ""I told you so"" look on his face.

""Alec…there's nothing up there."" Holly informs him with a look of concern on her face, ""Are you feeling ok?""

In disbelief Alec looks back towards the building. As Holly said nothing is there. The shadow had evaporated. No red eyes remained.

""But I was sure I saw…""

""Ya you really need to get home Alec,"" Katie prescribes, walking over to grab his arm, ""You must be sick or something. You're freezing.""

""Guys I'm not sick and I saw something up there!"" Alec insists, continuing to point at the rooftop, ""It looked like a guy watching us. He had red eyes and we stared right at each other!"" The girls share a quick look of worry.

""Sounds like the beginning to a bad horror flick,"" Katie tentatively jests.

""We really need to get home,"" Holly says slowly and carefully, being very deliberate with her words, ""We can talk about it later ok?""

Seething silently, Alec agrees and they once again continue their silent journey. It does not take a telepath to tell Alec that his female friends are very concerned with his mental health. He decides to keep quiet about any other noises he hears in the darkness. Ahead of them a flag pole is draped with an American flag. It flaps in the wind in slow careful waves. Its owner was either too lazy or too forgetful and had left it out overnight. More importantly though the pair of red eyes from before can be seen looking down on them.

The street lights finally go out after the on and off flickering. Every street light is snuffed out. Yet this darkness was not the usual kind, Alec can not see even a foot in front of him. Holly screams out, almost covering up the sound of a body landing in front of them. Alec braces himself.

Light returns to the world. Crouched low in front of them is a boy. With his eyes still adjusting to the rapid changes in light Alec is unable to get a really good look at him.

""Sastipe."" The boy greets in a foreign language. He rises to his feet and holds out a hand to the partially blind trio, ""This is a robbery.""",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1jlvfm,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1jlvfm/critique_and_feedback_kamiheroes_of_fate_first/,

---

The trio was led into a back hallway lined with cobwebs and stark fluorescent lights. A dark smell of stale hops and rust permeated the air. The boy stuck so close to Spitz he could feel her elbow brush his shoulder. Face carefully blank, she reached down to grab his hand; the boy let her take it, feeling the strength of her fingertips protect his own.

The bouncer leading them stopped at the end of the hall before a closed door. “We’re going to have to search you now.”

“We’re not carrying, and we’re not wired,” Demetri said.

The bouncer snorted. “Yeah, ‘cause I’m sure if you were sneaking weapons in, you’d just hand them over all peaceful-like. Take off your shirt, then turn and put your hands on the wall behind you.”

Demetri glanced over at Spitz and the boy, then complied, pulling his shirt over his head and twisting his pale upper body to show that there were no listening devices taped there. He raised his hands in a See? gesture before placing his palms against the brick. The stout man patted him down thoroughly, moving his hands up each thigh and along the skin of Demetri’s torso, feeling along his back.

“Easy, killer. You haven’t even bought me dinner yet.”

The man ignored him, shifting his attention to Spitz and pointing to the wall when he was finished. “Your turn.”

Demetri shrugged back into his shirt, raising an eyebrow at the rebel. “Be delicate, pard. That’s a lady you’re talkin’ to,” he remarked, his tone light but an unmistakable warning. Without looking at the boy, he said, “Take off your shirt, kid. Show ‘em you’re not runnin’ for Jack.”

The boy took off the ragged, oversized tee-shirt that Demetri had loaned him, revealing a torso mottled with bruises in various colorful stages of repair. The stout man searched Spitz, more ginger than he was with Demetri.

“Implants?”

“They’re all natural,” Spitz quipped before Demetri could answer. The man chuffed laughter, removing his hands from her.  

“If we were microchipped, your sensors would have gone off at the door. Don’t know about the kid though. He’s sort of a new addition to the crew, if you take my drift.”

The stout man turned the boy away from him, and the boy automatically cringed at the feeling of hard, uncaring hands on his shoulders as the rebel patted down his jeans and moved his hands upward. The stout man traced a finger beneath the edge of one of the boys shoulderblades, feeling the skin there.”

“Yeah, there’s the scar. It’s been removed. You’re clean. Go on in through those doors. Grant is waiting to see you.”

Demetri scowled. “Grant? We’re here to see Wolfe.”

“I don’t know nothing about that,” the stout man said in a tone of voice that said even if he did, he would not be commenting on it. He crossed his arms, fed up with them, and waved his hand in the direction of the door. “Grant will explain the situation to you.”

Demetri turned the handle and threw the door wide for Spitz and the boy, then followed them into the back room. Around a scarred round table, a baker’s dozen of men and women sat, ranging in age from adolescence to infirmity. All turned their eyes to the blockade runners. Blueprints and other assorted papers were scattered between them. All spoke in intense whispers and were dressed in street clothes. All wore a white armband, the sign of the resistance. A hush fell over the room.

It was a flash mob.

Upon seeing them, a young woman on the opposite side of the table from the door stood up and walked around to greet them. She wore auburn hair in a flat-ironed bob which spoke of cool efficiency, and her hazel eyes watched with careful confidence from the soft angles of her face. She looked briefly at Spitz and the boy before settling her gaze on Demetri.

“Hello. I’m Daphne Grant.”

She held out her hand to shake. Demetri, raised from childhood in the South, could not resist the gesture, but he recoiled when he saw the woman’s hand.

It was sinuously metallic, gleaming under the dim lights. He could hear the minute clicking of the gears in the biolimb. *Borg.* He almost withdrew his hand, but it was too late. The woman’s robotic hand closed on his own, and he could feel the faint vibration of its working parts closed beneath strange alloy. It felt like shaking hands with a brittle gearshift.

She saw something flash across his face.

“Sorry. It does tend to startle people at first. Lost the first one to a tank. Bastards rolled over it and kept right on going. Hell of a thing, eh?”

“Terrible,” Demetri spat, relieved to get any coherent syllable out at all. He had to resist the urge to wipe his hand on his jeans in revulsion when she finally released it.

*If it happened to me, I would start shaking with my left. Jesus.*

“I’m Demetri Tillis. This is my wife Spitz, and the boy is called Pet. He has no name.”

“Welcome.” Her eyes turned to the boy and she looked at him hard with vague recognition. “This is no son of yours.” It wasn’t a question. Her eyes searched the boy’s face.                 

To Demetri’s surprise, the boy raised his eyes to meet her words and held up his head. There was a vulnerable, drawn look on his face, and Demetri felt a wave of resentment towards the woman for putting him on the spot.  Seated among haggard rebels, the boy looked very small.

“I’m with them now.” His voice was quiet, almost too soft to hear.

Spitz put her hand on the boy’s narrow shoulder with an air of defiance.

“It’s a long story that’s none of your business,” Spitz said with soft finality. “Are we going to run a deal or not? Where’s Wolfe? Not much of a welcome party you folks got going on here. Is all the cloak and dagger really necessary?”

Grant shrugged. “Unfortunately, yes. Every person in this room was searched before entering it, even if they’ve been here dozens of times before. Even me. That’s the state of affairs, I’m afraid. Please, sit down.” She looked to a young man at her right and raised an eyebrow at him with unconscious arrogance. He quickly got up to retrieve three metal folding chairs that were leaned against the far wall.

“Near the door, please. Never know when you’ll have to make an inauspicious exit,” Demetri said with a wry smile. Obliging, the mobbers nearest the door scooted out from the table to make room for them to sit, the feet of their chairs scratching against the concrete.

When they settled at the round table, Grant’s gaze fell on the boy, who dropped his eyes.

At the mention of the name, Grant shifted her attention and sat down, her jaw set in a hard line. She placed her elbows on the table.

“They got him.” There was no reason for her to elaborate; the explanation was in her voice, the implied pronoun They, unmarked black cars parked on corners and wiretaps and even those people you thought you knew best. “The wife and kids too.” She laughed, but the sound was harshly bitter. She held out her palm and blew into it as if puffing a feather off her fingertips. “That fast.”

“Sorry for your loss,” Demetri replied mechanically, but even though he kept his face neutral, his stomach rolled. Wolfe was not someone he would consider a friend—the times were too hard to throw that particular word around lightly—but he had trusted the man despite the fact that he knew nearly nothing about him, and that was more than he could say for most people. “Were you aware of our dealings with him?”

“I’m aware of a lot more than that. I pulled your files before I agreed to meet with you.”

“Files?”

 We need weapons, but Thomas was far too liberal in his dealings with unknown agents. That’s what got him killed.” She stopped herself a moment and looked at the boy again with grim speculation. “Perhaps the boy should wait for you at the bar.”

“He’s one of us. Like he said. Anything you have to say to us, you can say in front of him.”

“He’s very young.”

“You’re pretty young yourself. Aren’t you a little inexperienced to be running a flash mob? Seems like a couple of people here have some seniority over you.”

A hard look crossed the woman’s face, making her seem suddenly older. “Seniority means nothing to us. Elderly, stupid politicians are the ones who got America into this to begin with. We tried to reform the government from the inside out. But when we tried to use the political process, liberty slipped right through our fingers. Now look at us.”

Spitz started to answer, but a passing helicopter caused the room to grow still. The mobbers and the blockade runners listened to the bi-rotor surveillance chopper in the sky above, filling the air with its rhythmical beating force. The noise rose and then passed like a muffled ghost over the desolate streets of the city.

Demetri locked eyes with Grant. A long second of recognition passed between them. Demetri realized that there were moments in a person’s life when they felt like a human embodiment of their era. For him, this was that time, crouched among rebels in a bar basement with the eyes of the State overhead.

“Where’s the money?” Demetri asked, breaking the silence. “It’s dangerous to meet in such large numbers. We don’t feel safe here.”

“Is there somewhere you do feel safe?” one of the other mobbers asked with dry amusement.

“If there was, a mobber’s den wouldn’t make the list. Do you have our payment or not?” Spitz replied shortly.

“That depends on whether you have the shipment intact.” Grant narrowed her eyes at Spitz, then looked back to Demetri. “Seventy-three AA12 automatic assault shotguns, seven cases of grenades, twenty-four pounds of C4 explosives, and forty-eight XM32 assault rifles. In return, you get a hundred and twenty grand. That sound about right?”

“The price has gone up. It’s a hundred and thirty now. I would have mentioned that over the phone, but for obvious reasons that wasn’t an option.”

“Why?” an old mobber barked from across the table, furious. “You can’t increase the price without giving us fair warning. That’s not part of the deal.”

“The *fuck* I can’t,” Demetri said with quiet force. “We drove stolen government weapons across the goddamned country in the smuggler’s hold of a stickshift moving truck. We risked our lives so you could have your triggers takeout. The extra ten is for the bribes I had to make to keep my ass out of Labyrinth and protect my family. I won’t take anything less.”

“You won’t be getting it,” the old man said. “Wolfe would—”

“Shut up, Keylor.” Grant was curt. “Wolfe would take the deal. We can afford it. What we can’t afford is a delay.” She looked back at Demetri, grim. “You think you’re the only ones who run Confederate guns from the badlands? We’ll switch suppliers if we have to.”

“Good luck. Every competitor I’m aware of is dead or in prison. If you want to fight the jacks with Molotov cocktails and potato guns, go right ahead. You won’t see me stopping you.”

Demetri felt his body break out in a light sweat, but did not allow his anxiety to show on his face, keeping his expression nonchalant. It was a dangerous bluff. Throwing out the deal with the Pack mobbers would mean getting stuck in LA without the funds to make the trip back east, just another ghost nickel-and-diming contraband in a back alley, dodging the squads at every step. Not smart, or safe. It was an easy way to end up on a meat hook with TRAITOR pinned to your shirt.

There was a long moment of tense silence. Neither the flash mob nor the blockade runners seemed willing to break it. Finally, Grant sighed.

“You’re nothing like Wolfe described you from your work here before. You must have changed a lot, Tillis.”

Demetri shrugged. “Things are different now.”

“We could really use your help,” Grant added.

“I don’t make bombs anymore, if that’s what you’re getting’ on about,” Demetri replied, a touch of irritation in his voice. “That’s not part of the deal.”

“An extra ten thousand wasn’t part of the deal either.”

“I was under the impression you used to be a patriot.”

“Patriotism is a luxury not afforded to fathers. Or people afraid of death.”

“So you’re just a coward then,” the young man who had gotten up to seat them said suddenly, the words viciously sarcastic.

“You don’t know what—” Spitz started, but Demetri held up a hand to her. She quieted. He turned to look at the mobber.

“You call it cowardice. I call it self preservation. To-may-to, to-mah-to. Whatever. Are you going to buy the guns or not? If not, I can make other arrangements.”

Grant held her hands out in a gesture of bemused surrender, then put her elbows back on the table, lacing her fingers together. “We have no choice. Time is of the essence. We need the weapons now. Where is the shipment?”

“In a safe place. Where’s the money?”

Grant looked at the young man again, who got up silently and left the room, shooting Demetri a dirty look before unlocking the door and slipping out. The room was still again. There was no exchange of civilities or small talk. The mood was as somber as a charnel house.

“Witch-aw,” Demetri said to Grant once the young man left, making a whip-cracking motion with one hand. “Got your boy pretty rolled, don’t you? Does he sit up and beg too?”

“Mobbers aren’t gun runners. They know what loyalty means,” one of the women sitting at the table said. She looked at Demetri, Spitz, and the boy with disdain.

“So do jacks. You won’t catch me rolling over for them, either.”

“We encourage discipline here, yes,” Grant replied. “It’s what keeps most of us alive.”

The young man entered the room again, carrying a battered looking duffel bag with him. He carried it around the table to Grant, who thanked him. Grant put the bag on the table and shoved it across, pushing documents in its wake. One of them slid over the edge and the boy caught it, putting it back on the table without looking at it.

Demetri opened the bag.

“Feel free to count it, but it’s all there,” Grant said.

Demetri unceremoniously dumped the bag out on the table, feeling angry disbelief rise up in him like a fever. A mountain of stacked bills and a bundle wrapped in brown butcher paper spilled across the wood.

*“Dollars?* Why don’t you just go ahead and pay me with German marks? How about some nice shiny beads while you’re at it?”

“Calm down, Demetri—”

Demetri stood up and threw the empty bag down in disgust. He felt the exhaustion of the long road west fall on his shoulders like a pallet of bricks.

I’m stuck out in a chilly wasteland with a target on my back.

And through Jose’s rearview mirrors, I watch for the inevitable flashes of red and blue. I wait for the whine of a spiteful siren and the sweaty policemen shouting at me to drop the weapon. The air is still. I’m telling Jose to slow down. *We don’t want to look suspicious, man.* The thunk of his jalopy rolling over something on the road startles the both of us. We keep driving. 

“I just wanna go home,” I tell him, cracking my knuckles over and over and over again. I can feel my armpits flooding with sweat and I think I can hear my own adrenaline. “You should just drop me off at home, dude.""

Jose whips his head around at me in awe. 


“Are you fucking kidding me, man?” he asks, the moonlight dripping into his pock-ridden cheeks. He runs his damp hand through his hair and continues to follow the speed limit. “You wanna go *home* right now?”


“Well where the fuck else am I supposed to go?”

“We’re going to keep driving, okay? We’re going to find a place to eat, we’re going to wait for the sun to come up, and then I’ll take you home. But not right now.”

He’s staring at the road, his brow furrowed, his hands choking the steering wheel. Jose’s right. Going home would only make things worse. We’re on our way to some town in the middle of nowhere so that we can grasp at a chance to ease our minds. There is nobody else on the road. I am shaking, now uncontrollably, feeling like I would just rather die. Thinking about my mother, Darlene, and my trailer in Rodrigo, and my brother who is probably asleep right now. By looking at Jose, I can tell he is replaying the events of tonight in his head. Trying to trip on some kind of answer along the way, but I know that nothing is catching. 


Sometimes I feel like Death is following me around. I’ve never told anyone that I feel this way, but I do. I catch a glance of him in the mirror, peering over my shoulder with a menacing grin and glowing eyes. Tucking me in bed at night and waiting, crouched in a corner, in the darkness of my bedroom. Sometimes I’ll be talking to someone and I can tell he has inhabited their body, as their face deforms and their laughs drown my head. He likes me. He likes to tease me. He picks up my prescriptions at the drugstore and mixes them together with the finesse of a chemist, he precludes the explosions and the fires because he’s waiting for the perfect time to smother me. 


I’ve been awake for around twenty-seven hours and I am verging on delirious, squatting in the car seat, my head shoved in between my knees. I’m grabbing at my hair until it hurts. Some of it is coming out, some even in chunks, but I just want to feel something. I notice Jose’s nervous glances every so often, I can hear him reciting prayers to himself in Spanish. 

I am a frenetic, flaky-skinned twenty-two year old man with no job and a multitude of vices. I have a penchant for poisoning myself. I have a best friend named Jose, and today, I watched him kill somebody.

“I feel like they know,” I said. “Yeah, dude, I feel like they’re onto us. I’m feeling like I need to vomit.”

Without warning, I throw the car door open and I expel nothing but bile from my body. Feeling even weaker, and even sadder, I slump in my seat and begin to cry.

“Shut up, man,” Jose tells me. “Just shut up, okay? If you fucking freak out on me, I swear—”

“I’m not going to *fucking* freak out on you. Just keep fucking driving.”

The odd cactus punctuates silence on the empty road. Silence contains carbon monoxide that has leaked into Jose’s Nissan Pulsar. Nothing else explains the emptiness surrounding us. There are no trees in the desert, just shrubs that are so low to the ground that they prickle at your ankles when you walk through them. The only existing proof that we are spanning the planes that scratch these brash edges of Arizona are the mountains, growing ever-closer. Their crags and peaks are awash in the cold blue of the imposing moon. There are holes poked in the sky masquerading as stars, through which some punishing deity is watching us.

*(ed. I feel like that last paragraph is kinda wordy and over the top, but I don't know)*

I look at my watch. There’s a crack across the face that distorts the digital numerals only slightly. The dull green glow of the LCD murmurs 5:03. Jose is still driving. His wild eyes have waned into heavy-lidded orbs. The horizon is beginning to reveal the sun, cracking the landscape in half. Everything is orange now. Through the haze of the early morning, we see the kind of lights that imply civilization.

“Next diner we see, we’re going in,” Jose assures me. I continue to stare ahead, my chin rested in my hand, my foot nervously jiggling.
We approach a road sign.

*Rodrigo, 4 Miles.*

*Douglas, 63 Miles.*

“Did that sign say Rodrigo?”

“I thought that was just me—are there two Rodrigos in Arizona?”

I shake my head slowly. “I—I’m pretty sure there aren’t. What the hell, man? Have we just entered the Twilight Zone?”

Jose is hyperventilating. Beads of sweat form on his forehead and drip down his cheeks like tears. He pulls over with a screech. 

“Percy,” he tells me, his voice low and quiet. “We just went in a circle. We’re back in Rodrigo.”

“So we *have* entered the Twilight Zone. How is that possible? We’ve been driving for hours, dude. *Hours. Hours* in the opposite direction of town. There’s no possible way we ended up back here. Maybe this is a different Rodrigo, man. There’s no way.”

Jose manages a sigh and tilts his head back. 

“This is the same Rodrigo,” he says. “It is. I know it is.”

“So what are we supposed to do?” I ask, the sun now fully bathing us in a bright white heat. The desert is bleached in light. The sky is cloudless. I squint in the direction in which Rodrigo lays, and surrender my doubts as I recognize the lowly semi-ghost town.

“Drop me off at home,” I say. “I want to go home.”

Jose twists his head backwards, looking behind him, weighing options.

“Nah, man. I can’t do that.”

“Well, where are you planning on going, then?” I point to his fuel gauge. The needle rests a few millimeters from E. 

Jose clumsily maneuvers the car to face away from Rodrigo. He turns to me and says, “I’m getting the hell away from here. You comin’?”

I breathe in and out, and begin counting my breaths. At fourteen, I turn to him. My tired eyes feel rancid from being open for such long expanses of time. 

“Just let me out here. I’ll figure it out.”

Jose rumples his brow in apprehension, and hesitates for moment until he remembers that he’s on the run. With the manic energy he’s managed to accumulate, he laughs as I exit the car. 

“*Buena suert*e, man. I probably won’t see you again.”

With that, he speeds off into the ochre precipices—with every intention, I’m sure, of driving off one of them. *Adios, Jose*, I whisper to myself as I tread towards Rodrigo.

The smell of fresh grass when daddy mows it in spring, the wind in my hair when biking down the hill next to our summer house, the feeling of wet sand on a beach in the golden light of a hot summer day.

I miss the light.

This constant high pitched sound irritates me more and more.

Will you silence it?

I am thirsty, not much but I can feel an itch in my throat.

Did you hear me?

You touching my hand is a wonderful, unexpected, sensation.

What are you saying?

You speak in such a low voice, it is almost impossible to follow.

I will concentrate.

I hear you whisper. 

“Marcus, I am going on holyday tomorrow, I am so sorry that I will not be here.”

Why?

I am so excited, that you know my name.

I can’t wait. 

Tomorrow something big will be happening.

“I wanted to hold your hand when they switch off life support.”

Thanks for reading.

***

Over the years I’ve been to France with my family many times; the Loire Valley, Mont Saint-Michel, a place in the south I can’t remember the name of and the all important Disneyland Paris (because isn’t that really what France is about when you’re a kid?). Normally these trips would be for a week or two, staying in a gite or on a campsite where you could soak up a phenomenally unhealthy amount of sun everyday. A few times however, we went over for just a day to carry out an important mission. The Booze Cruise.

One such journey happened when I was around the age of four or five. We woke up ridiculously early, got into the car and drove down to the coast to await the giant ferry that would take us across to the land of slightly less expensive alcohol. I’m going to be honest and tell you that the details of the day are a little hazy to me fifteen years on. Whether it was Calais or Boulogne, I don’t know. How many hours were spent at E.Leclerc and Intermarche finding the best fizz for our francs, I don’t know. If my brother and I laughed at the sight of frozen bags of frogs legs… that I do know. We did. But almost everything else is a blur, right up until we were about to head home.

**It all happened on the beach.**

Having been carefully arranged in the car like high-scoring Tetris blocks, limbs delicately positioned around crates of beer and wine that spilled out from the boot into the back seats and footwells, we went to the coast to have a little something to eat in the last of the afternoon sun. We sat on a sea wall eating sweet pastries and drinking orange juice, my parents pleased with their purchases, my brother and I simply excited to be at a beach. As soon as we finished eating we hurtled across the tiny sand dunes towards the water, coming to a halt to make the best god-damn sandcastle you’ve ever seen. I was feeling a little funny in my stomach, probably just all the excitement of eating and playing far too energetically. We carried on playing for a while, my parents came over and it was great. What a fantastic day with the family…

“Mum? Dad?”

I suddenly didn’t feel well at all. For a moment they looked at me, smiles still on their faces from this day of happy family memories and bargain booze. Their faces dropped. All colour drained. Even my brother stopped construction in the sand. In an instant my dad picked me up and pulled my shorts off, leaving me standing on a beach in a pair of tiny childrens pants. I distinctly remember them being stripy – in blue, white and red. The *Tricolore*. But looking down I was not greeted with the sight of French patriotism, but the horrifying hue of *merde*.

I had shat myself.

I was crying.

“What’s happening?” I thought to myself. My body convulsed and my parents retreated momentarily out of the line of fire. Of course, this was diarrhoea, but it was not something I had experience at that age. Hell, I used an adult toilet, I’d been handling my business on my own like a pro. I was a big boy! Why the hell was my arse vomiting so violently? ***“WHAT IS HAPPENING?”***

There I am. On a beach. Leaking.

Where do you go from there?

Apparently, my dad knew exactly what to do, and he got to work quickly. He grabbed the spade that had been used just moments ago to build a glorious sandcastle, and began to dig furiously. After a minute he took my pants, holding them like some kind of radioactive device, then threw them into the chasm. Kicking sand back to cover the evidence, his cold eyes locked dead on mine.

“We have to go.”

We ran back to the car, and he quickly fashioned a protective seat from cardboard and plastic bags. I was thrust unceremoniously into the back of the car, the high-score was no longer an issue, and the tires screeched on the tarmac as we sped away to freedom.

I'm 16, so i'm sure the writing isn't totally up to par. I know where the story will get to eventually, but i'm having trouble with the flow of it. Anything and everything is helpful at this point. Also, I have no idea how my computer works so i'm copying and pasting. Alright, here it is.

Intro
It was dark. Darker than it had ever been in this forest, so it seemed to the young guard. He looked out into the trees from the city walls. Night watch was somewhat boring to him. He’d rather be practicing his swordplay or at least watching during the day. Then, his mentor wouldn’t be snoring in his chair and maybe he could talk to some of the other guards, instead of staring into the blackness of night. He looked up. Not even the Moon or stars were shining on this black, black night. A twig cracked, piercing the silence of the night. Something was near the gate, but he couldn’t see. Why was it so silent? Weren’t the creatures of the night going about their business a moment ago? Crack. Another twig crunched underfoot of…something. The boy grabbed a nearby torch and tried to see what was there. Was someone laughing? “My mind is playing tricks on me.” He thought. Just then, a cold breeze rushed past. All the torches went out at once. Laughter, again. 
He cursed to himself. Now he had to relight them all
“Sir?” The boy said called to his elder. With a startled snort and a jolt, he awoke. 
“What is it, lad?” a gruff voice grumbled, sleepily.
“The torches blew out. May I have the matches?”
“Aye, here.” The guard fumbled for the matchbook. He held it out to the boy. “Here ya are, lad.”
The boy took the matchbook. He started to turn away but froze at the cold sound.
“What now?” The guard asked impatiently.
“Nothing, sir. I-I just thought I heard someone.”
“Nonsense. Give me a match. There’s no one here but us.” He lit the match. It could hardly penetrate the dark.
There it was again, the laughter. With a strong whoosh, the match went out. The guard groaned and a large thump was heard as he hit the floor.
“Sir!” The boy called out, lighting a match, to behold his mentor, dead. “Sir…” he whispered.
The flame was swallowed up by the darkness and the sound of horrible, horrible laughter rang through the air.

The hastily scrawled letters cover most of the front side, while the back contains only the traditional symbol for truth, drawn without the least amount of rush.

They knew how to grab my attention.

*&amp;ldquo;Disharmony is the true name of your Mistress, she who has one sole adviser. The face she dons in public is as familiar to you as it is false, just as false is your notion that four are the Powers that rule. What is true is that one stands alone upon the blood of three, he who wears the mask he made of his old name of Justice. You serve Deceit.&amp;rdquo;*

Now I can&amp;rsquo;t read past this point.

I wanted to find and strangle the author of those phrases. While I did crumple the paper in rage after reading it for the first time, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to destroy it nor to hand it over to the Arm in charge of me. Instead I shoved it into my pocket and let those words destroy everything I knew about the world.

At first I resisted, I told myself I would find who had put those words to paper and crush them with the weight of the Law.

When I lay down yesterday night, I was still seething. Soon after I was standing again and I&amp;rsquo;d have killed myself if it could have helped anything. Now here I am, locking a reinforced door behind me to make sure no one stops the world from learning the truth of this note.

Tracing my finger over these words, I notice for the first time they have been written in dark red ballpoint. Only those in service of the face of Mercy are allowed to use pens of this color.

Mercy.

___________________________

Chapter 3

Tom stopped his security van at the entrance to the parking lot. Before entering, he had to give way to a convoy of cleaning vans. As they drove by, he could again smell that strange scent he had reeked at the Taco Bell two hours before. It was faint, but he and Mike both wrinkled their nose.
He entered the empty place and was greeted with a fire of high pressure lamps, that threw cold lights on the tarmac of the Staten Island mall. He knew that the place he was looking for was at the far end. There were no shops, but a low white and weathered building. The door he was looking for had a sign with the letters “FACILITIES” written on it, and left of the plain entrance, there was a varnished hatch.
X marks the spot, Tom thought.
Mike stretched his back, and said “Ok, Last lift. Man, I really want twelve Coors and a blow job.” 
Tom reversed the car, so that it came to a stop with the backdoor no more than 10 yards from the building and he killed the engine.
He flicked two switches, and bright lights on the roofline of the van came on.
Mike scratched his head, put on his cap and said “Yes sir, let’s do this.”
Tom nodded and acknowledged by saying “OK, you grab, I check.”
Mike nodded, and made a gesture with both hands.
Let’s go.
Both men looked around and checked if there was anybody near the vehicle.
The surroundings were void of any movement, and Tom pressed two buttons on the dashboard.

Both doors unlocked, and they stepped out.
Cool, unmoving air and a scent of ripe organic trash surrounded them.
They walked to the back of the car.
Mike continued walking to the hatch and produced a brass key.
Tom stayed back, and watched for incoming threats.
The remaining night lights of the mall and the safety lights of the van competed and drew multiple half-shadows on the tarmac.
Mike opened the hatch, and pulled a large, scratched leather bag with a steel handle out of it.
Except the background noise of the city, the mall was without a single sound.
As Tom was watching the scene, thoughts began to drift in his mind.

He could not remember, when he had been last to a mall with his family.
His son Max was now 8 years old, and he finally had bound with him, no longer calling him Tom, but dad. Every time Max said that word, it had quite an impact on Tom, who never thought he could feel such an affinity to anyone.  
Sarah, his wife, would never say it out loud, but after his service tours in countries most Americans could not find on a map, or just spell, she desperately wanted them to finally become a real family.
She had been faithful and patient while he had fought futile battles on nameless grounds, and he felt the need to become the husband she deserved.
But good paid jobs for vets are not easy to find. 
Who needs a state sanctioned killing machine, when nobody needs to be killed?
He took a deep breath and wanted to tell Mike that he would not go for a beer after this shift.

“So bright.” a toneless voice whispered in his ear.
Tom exhaled sharply and whispered a breathless “shit” while turning around and taking a jump simultaneously.
He exclaimed “Mike!” while grabbing for his Taser gun.
Mike looked over Tom’s shoulder, had already dropped the leather bag and taken a combat position with his Taser gun aimed in the direction of Tom’s scream. 
His eyes were predatory slots and he furiously said “What the fuck, man. How could he sneak up on you?”
Tom ignored the question, fully knowing that Mike would chew him out later, and looked at the figure that had scared him shitless.
The LED lights of the Taser guns threw electric blue cones on the face of the intruder.
It was a boy, age 10 to 12, slim, Caucasian and he was naked.
The boy did not move a single muscle, only his wide open eyes with fully dilated pupils focused in rapid succession on the two men.
Tom felt the mall parking lot grow; other people or cars were now galaxies away.
The sour smell in his mouth was familiar, Adrenalin kicking his organism into martial law.
He shouted to the boy “Stand back. Stand back or I will tase you!”
Textbook, but he still felt stupid to shout the words at this 4 foot child.
The boy did not move, but whispered “You are so bright and gorgeous.”
Mike took a step forward, and said “Oh fuck, it’s a meth kid.” to no one in particular.
He took another step and was now an arm length away from the boy.
Mikes Taser was pointing exactly into the forehead of the little fellow.
“Move, kid, or I will kick the meth pipe out of your drugged ass.” Mike said in a commanding voice, and the boy moved.

In an astonishing fluid and fast movement, the boy dived to the right, turned his head and bit Mike in his right wrist.
The Taser gun went off, but the spicules hit only air over the right shoulder of the boy.
Mike began to scream unarticulated sounds, and tried to pull back, but the boy had his jaw locked on the skin of his hand.
Tom finally found a vector and fired his Taser gun.
The needles hit the boy in the back, and Tom pressed the trigger of the gun hard.
The boy’s limbs began to dance uncontrollably, but to the shock of both men, his face and eyes were unaffected. Mike found his language back and screamed “Get him off, fuck, get him off!”
Tom dropped the gun, made a step forward and kicked the boy in the side of his head.
He wore steel enforced security boots, and he gave the boy a full dose.
Tom heard cheek, jawbone and cranium snap with muffled cracks.
Like stepping on a small animal, rushed through his head, and without thinking, he kicked again.
The boy began to bleed from his ears, eyes, nose and mouth, but he still would not let go.
Mike was getting even more agitated and shouted “He gives me AIDS. The little shit bird gives me AIDS! FUCK!” in a high pitched voice. 
Tom was shocked by seeing that the boy’s penis was fully erected.
Full of disgust he kicked again, and finally the boy fell backwards.
Mike looked at his hand, his fingers were shivering.
The boy rolled into a fetus position, and laid still.
Both men saw in silent horror, that the boy had only stopped biting because Tom’s kicks had crushed every bone in his face that could have be useful for building biting pressure.
Tom could not take his eyes off the boy’s shredded face, because through the curtain of blood that poured from his eyes, the child was still fixating both men.
Mike looked down and emotionless said “He has a full hard on, that little fuckhead.”
Through his destroyed mouth, the boy muttered two words that sounded like “no light”, turned around and crawled away on all four like the world’s largest and whitest lizard.
Mikes mouth was standing ajar, and he even had forgotten about his hand for the time being.
“Mother fucking fuck” he whispered.
He finally remembered his condition and his face warped into a painful grimace.
Tom looked at Mike’s hand, and turned to the cabin of the van to get gauze bandage and a disinfection flask.
He began to spray the mauled hand, and Mike protested with a hearty “Watch it man, it’s tender, not like your mom’s clit!”
Tom ignored him, began to dress the hand and asked “Shall we call it in?”
Mike looked at him and said “What? That a small freaky kid just bit me, got a boner doing it, you trampled the freaks head like a ripe melon, and now the bloody spawn crawls around the parking lot like a horny lizard?”
“Forget calling it, let’s finish this shit tour, and then we put some Blue Label on it, yes sir” he continued.
Tom accepted it and said, “OK, I throw the bag in and punch it back to TC. But I say fuck the Blue Label and we head to the Queens Clinic later”.  
Mike nodded, and unbeknownst to them it was that decision, that let them survive the next hour.

Yet the task upon my shoulders is to bring down a centuries-old institution that also happens to be the central body of government of an empire. Whoever wants this done must be entirely crazy.

It takes the crazy for change to happen. The lucid are often too busy being comfortable with their surroundings.

The trip from the Archival Section to the Tower of Truth &amp;mdash; hypocrites &amp;mdash; was almost uneventful, which only made me more nervous. I wanted to remain focused, but all I was able to think was that I was walking into a very elaborate trap.

But there was no trap. That I&amp;rsquo;m still alive in this hallway is proof enough that I have succeeded in my mission. I can&amp;rsquo;t hear the words pouring from the loudspeakers mounted over the square in front of the Palace, but my mind's ear can recall every single one just as if I could.

What were the odds? Zero.

Unless&amp;mdash;

I reject the idea before it has time to completely form inside my head, but part of it remains: I have been played. Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s a reason I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t die after all.

Boot steps ahead. My surroundings are about to turn very uncomfortable to me.

Suppressing a gasp, I take a desperate step back to take cover behind a corner. If that Shield sees me, I&amp;rsquo;m dead. I spin around frantically, looking for some better place to hide, feeling more and more anxious as the clacking grows louder.

&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the meaning of this?&amp;rdquo; I hear as I&amp;rsquo;m about to enter a conference chamber. I turn to him, trying and failing to act naturally. &amp;ldquo;Hand 052. It was you!&amp;rdquo;

I plunge into the room before he can react, but then I hear him punching the red button beside the door.

&amp;ldquo;Traitor!&amp;rdquo;

Chapter 2

Tom looked through the side window. He never understood how anybody could be willing to live here. The dirt, the ignorance and the greyness of all things felt nauseating to him. So many angry people that would rather walk over the corpse of a dead hobo than miss a green light.
He never understood how such a stinking cesspool might be called the Big Apple. 

He watched the scenery in the Taco Bell windows on the other side of the road while on the radio Beyonce was singing about what a crazy bitch she was. An older man sat behind one of the windows, with hair that seemed like it hadn’t seen a brush since Obama had mesmerized the country in more of the same bullshit, licked the salt of his fries while his mind seemed miles away. 
A monstrously fat and bald woman was chewing on a bite of what looked like a chicken leg with her mouth opening like a dying fish. Two young boys, dressed in a mix of leather and jeans, one wearing a fedora, were talking using their hands more than their mouths. Tom was not sure if those two were homeless junkies or just another bunch of fucking hipsters.
Tom sighed and wished he were still a smoker. 

The door of the Taco Bell, that his colleagues always called fart factory, opened, and his partner Mike stepped out, holding a paper bag in each hand. Mike stopped at the curb and lifted both hands to his head and put his index fingers in both of his ears.
In an explosion of light and sound three police cars, blazed over, sirens screaming and lights blinding.
Mike grimaced, lowered his hands and walked over to Tom’s car, as soon as cars were over.
He headed to the passenger side and knocked.
Tom looked at him, raised his eyebrows, and lifted his right fist.
He stretched out his thumb and pinky and waved horizontally, the sign for “LOOK IF SOMEONE IS COMING, IDIOT”. 
Mike shrugged and gave Tom an annoyed look, but then he glanced both sides and gave Tom a thumbs up.
Everything clear.
Tom pressed a custom button on the dashboard, and the armored door unlocked with a metallic noise. 
Mike opened the door, swung himself on the passenger seat, and closed it.

“I can hear the sand in your vagina” he said, and threw both paper bags on the dash.
Tom hated that testosterone-talk, but with Mike nobody would possible survive a single shift without standing up to him.
“That’s not sand, that is the sound of my iron pubes” Tom replied, and Mike began to smile.
Mike pulled out an envelope with a list of addresses and asked “So, you want your elephant tampon right now, or after the next stop?” 
Tom let out a little air through his nose and said “After the next lift, and your description of my chicken burrito did not stoke up my appetite.”.
He started the security van and pulled out into the slow traffic.
Mike squinted his eyes and tried to find the address. 
“What, finally going blind from all the masturbating marathons?” Tom asked, and Mike smiled again.
If Tom was lucky, that would be the end of the banter, and they could talk bullshit, nibble their fast food and end their tour without too much vocabulary lifted from the gutter.
But Mike seemed to be warmed up now and began “No sir, no more Mr. Handy Man for me. This weekend I was in the Blue Tomato, getting my throat wet with some lights, and guess what?”
Tom said nothing and discovered why the traffic was so slow.
Around 60 yards in front of them, a cleaning van was washing the street.
He thought that it was impossible to clean that city, even with a biblical flood.
“Yeah” Mike continued “I finally got lucky.” 

Tom was concentrating on the traffic, as some of the more impatient, and stupid, drivers began to sound their horns and swerved pointlessly when seeking possible places to overtake the cleaning van.
Mike was unstoppable now and droned on “She isn’t young or a classic beauty, but she sure can clap a polka rhythm with her feet behind her head.”
As the road opened a second lane, the other cars began to mass overtake the cleaning van.
Tom also pulled out, and cut off an old Pontiac, that began to roar its horn and flash his light like metallic dragon.
He ignored the furious protests and sped up.
Mike grabbed the door handle and said “Woah Dude, we are no more in Afghanistan, no sir.” 

When Tom passed the orange cleaning truck, spray water from the large brushes hit the wind screen of his transporter.
Tom blinked, and as he summoned the wipers a strong smell filled the cabin.
Tome wrinkled his nose, and Mike had forgotten his flexible score for the moment and began to curse “Mother fucking fuck, man, they sure will get this place squeaky clean with that patented mixture of hot chocolate and dipshit!”.
Tom thought it smelled more like a chemical solution, with a undefinable metallic undertone.
The traffic sped up, and after the air in the cabin cleared, Mike remembered his maybe prepared speech.
“Anyway, man I tell you, that fine specimen could blow the skin of your zucchini.”
Tom gave him a salute and a weak smile and said “Good boy, so you finally got lucky”.
Mike grinned, scratched his testicles and said “Yes sir, I think she could be a fucking jackpot”
Tom lifted his eyebrows and thought that Mike for sure not planed that double entendre.
Mike, looking through his side window without seeing, said in a low voice “Yes Sir, I guess I am lucky”.
Tom smiled at Lucky Mike, who would lose his life and head in less than 48 hours.

All 4 of the characters are in their mid 30s but what if one character was in prison from 20-24 years old and that story can contributed greatly to the way the viewer sees the character. Do I shift to 1st person for the prison character as he's reliving it? Do I have my main character transition and foretell at the end of a chapter... ""Darren was a different story, he had a hard past..."" Then start a chapter as ""Darren"" in first person?

I guess I'm afraid of having too much telling of a story vs showing of a story. If you need better examples let me know.

Thanks all, I'm glad I found this sub.

Blog Post: http://mikekernfiction.com/2013/07/23/hallow-hill-part-5/

They walked in silence as the trees began to thin and a modest house came into view. There was a low barn that could house a cow or two and maybe a horse. As they passed by it, he saw there was no horse. There was very little hay too and from what little look he got inside, there was barely any in the loft. She caught him looking. “The cows graze. Easier.”

There were two cows and they walked untethered across a great, overgrown green surrounding a well. Paul saw other houses in the distance but most were in disrepair, their thatch roofs gone or collapsed while the stone and wood walls crumbled. He saw no other life.

“Where are the other villagers?”

“Most are dead of the plague,” she said without even looking at him. “Them that’s still alive are further out. None come round here much anymore.”

He swallowed, imagining the Blood Plague hiding in every tall stalk of grass or low hanging branch. Thegn Seigur told him he had nothing to fear from the plague, that he’d been born with it. “Once it passes you buy, it doesn’t come back,” the old thegn told him over and over. “Your mother’s gift to you.”

The house itself was low and simple, with stonework walls and a thatched roof that was in bad need of repair. The stonework itself was still solid, though discolored with age and growth. A well was in the center of the yard, a product of more stonework. When he asked about it, the girl told him her father had been a stone mason. “Where is he now?” he asked.

“Died,” she said simply. “Some war or another between some nobles. Something about rights to a fishing lake.”

“You mean the battles between House Rivers and House Sandlake? Ten years past? Lord Tomas Rivers won when my father added his numbers.”

“Did he?” she asked without much emotion in her voice. “That is nice. Does he like his lake?” The question made Paul frown and look away. “His youngest son drowned in it, and now none may use it.” The girl nodded and that was all they spoke of it. She leaned him against the wall of the house, taking some care he did not lean against his bad arm and flipped open the latch. She toed open the door and she helped him inside.

The interior of the farm house was small and made smaller by racks built into the walls meant for storing food for humans and feed for animals. There seemed to be much more of the latter than the former. She found him a seat on a bag of wheat that was half gone. It was soft but he still groaned as his weight shifted. Once he was settled she disappeared into another room and shut the door behind her, leaving him alone in the food storage room. Swallowing, he glanced around. What little light was left was filled with dust motes and the smell of rotting food and mold. He lay his head back against the stone wall and shivered. The cold was soaked deep into the stone and the rains left them damp. The thatched roof leaked somewhere, he could hear the slow drip. *What am I doing here? I need to get back. I need to…*

Paul didn’t know what he needed to do. He didn’t even know what he wanted to do. If went back they’d know him for a coward. If he disappeared they might have thought him killed or captured. Capture would mean his father would send more soldiers to get him back and war would erupt between the two Houses. *Would my capture or death mean more to my father than coming home alive?*

She came back then with a broken spade. The metal head of the tool was gone, leaving only the wooden haft. He blinked and eyed her carefully.

“What do you mean to do with that?”

She gave him an amused look. “My name is Tani. If you are a noble, as you say, you best learn how best to address folk eh?” She appeared not to notice the look of regret he gave her and walked closer. “As for this,” she said, hefting the wooden haft. “I had me an idea about getting that mail off. Now hold out your arms as best you can.”

She helped him to stand again and slid the spade handle through an iron ring that was embedded into the wall. He realized he was standing between two of them and knew what she meant to do. He held out his right arm and she slid the handle through the sleeve and behind his back. Already he felt the weight of the armor come free of his right shoulder and he tried to raise his left but the pain was too great.

“I can’t,” he grunted through clenched teeth. Tears welled into his eyes from the throbbing pain. She touched him lightly on his good shoulder and nodded. “It’s all right, here,” she said, slipping the handle through the neck of his mail and looped the other end through the second ring.

“Try and bring your one arm out now,” she urged.

Grunting, he crouched and pulled his head and right arm through the suspended sleeve of mail. The left clung to his injured shoulder and arm like wet cloth but soon he was half free. She guided him down to one knee and twisted the mail shirt until it slid up his injured arm. “Pull,” she whispered. “Only hurt for a moment.” The pain was blinding as he pulled his arm the rest of the way and collapsed on to his side, crying out as a thousand invisible knives stabbed his shoulder and arm.

“There now,” she said and almost smiled as she knelt by him. The world began to grow dark on him as she touched his cheek and forehead. “Rest little lord,” she whispered. It was almost comforting but the edge in her tone made him uneasy. His last thought before passing out was unexpectedly of Jack and wondered if the young Kharl had picked up the sword he had thrown away.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1ixira,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1ixira/feedback_hallow_hill_part_5_continuing_my_gritty/,

=========================

**Prologue**

It was so much like home. 
	
Of all the posts, this had been by far the most tranquil. The eye in the sky. Always watching. But for so long now it had come closer to gazing. Had it really been fifty years? They had arrived just in time. 
	
The previous rulers of this world had nearly destroyed it. It was just as the ancient ones had predicted...  the price for advancement was always the destruction of nature, and the disruption of its evolutionary growth. It was a story that would play out over and over again across time and space. 
	
As a mass extinction exploded across the place of their birth, they had already begun to stretch out into the galaxy looking for new worlds to plunder and destroy. All packed in with the best of intentions... but it was without doubt they would have eventually spread as a plague, like so many others. 
	
This place is not supposed to be a threat anymore, but here for the first time in decades came an order package. The notification clouded the large screen that showed its beautiful blue responsibility. 
	
The Earth is wondrous when seen from afar, a blue white dome highlighted with greens, grays, and browns. Slowly the world turned below, passing what was once called North America. A green blip appeared on the screen, highlighting the proposed target. The evidence had been assembled. An attack of this nature required the approval of not only those at strategic command, but the field officer required to press the button.
	
The package opened automatically, its title read “Human settlement in containment zone in breach of non-interference parameters.” Northport was what they called it. On the eastern edge of what had come to be called The Green Zone. The refuge for all who didn't wish to play by the rules in The City. 
	
The display of The Earth enhanced to show a bustling but primitive town. Huge piers jutted out into a well protected harbour, large wooden buildings scattered the waterfront. Huts and shacks dotted  snaking streets. Small sailing vessels slowly moved to and fro. 
	
The file read:
	
“Several human factions previously unknown for large scale cooperation have now begun regular dialogues and projects out of the commercial hub known locally as 'Northport'. On the surface, this settlement appears to remain slightly on the permissible side of regulations, however at least two of the known factions represented are capable of actionable resistance. 
	
Conclusion: the power structure of the human settlement is attempting to bring about the prophecy. To view the intelligence gathered for this conclusion select...” 
	
A dimly lit room appeared with seven humans seated at a small table. Three males and four females. All but one were plainly dressed, he wore the brown robes of the mysterious priests. 'The Brown Monks' as they had come to be called. He spoke in their strange alien tongue, but the program translated with text. 
	
“The signs are all in place, the builder of armies will pass through Northport. I beg you all to prepare for his arrival by assembling him a gift.” The monk drank deeply from a cup on the table.
	
A woman answered, “Monk, each representative here has already agreed to do this. Even if what your order claims is untrue, we need to cooperate more. We are walking a fine line with how large this town has gotten, but its infrastructure has become necessary...” 
	
The file closed. The rest was of little interest. Human politics even at its most advanced level was a waste of time. The screen zoomed in further on Northport, to the town square. A small crowd was gathered around one individual. A closer look revealed the same brown monk. The audio activated so it could hear, and again a text translation flowed across the screen. 
	
“In the time of peace and broken dreams, the stars will align to herald the coming of the Mete of Knowledge and Power. Watch for the signs to know his path. Men shall know work and play, but not dreams. Chaos will live with order. Fathers will not know their sons, mothers will not know their daughters, and all of their bellies shall be full. Few will know want, but all will know desire. When The Builder of Armies unlocks the gates of the great mystery, his path shall become no more clear, and those who follow him will know fear and death and hunger and toil, but their fires will light the path forward. For the forest is full of trees, but he shall know the way.” 
	
The monk gestured wildly as he spoke, “This prophecy is coming to pass. The Mete of Knowledge and Power is coming to Northport within the year. We must all work together to prepare for him the tools he will require to complete his journey. Smugglers, Labourers, Adepts, Farmers, Hedonites, Fisherfolk, even monks... we must all work together.” 
	
It lowered the audio. It had heard enough. Knowledge of the law is one thing. Abuse of it is another. It needn't see anymore. The Human side of the prophecy was disturbing and violent in nature, perhaps moreso than The Hu's own version. The firing solution appeared, one volley of the canons for a few moments would be all that was needed, but this demanded an extended display.  The volleys natched and whooshed as they fired, exploding outward as glowing red balls of flame. 
	
It re-activated the audio on the monk's sermon, “they are ever watching us. Closer than you might think. We must be united when he comes to us. For when they come, they will come with a rain of fire.” 
	
“Brother, look!” someone shouted. 
	
The monk turned and looked upward.
	
“No.” The monk said, “it's too early. This is not how...” 
	
The sounds of the weapon impacting the surface gave a loud roar and hiss, but as it watched the buildings and the bodies burn... it was the screams that seemed loudest. Their punishment would be visible from nearly all corners of the zone. The volleys sustained for ten minutes. 
	
Nothing remained. Smoke and steam rose high, billowing westward over the land. The Earth continued to spin. 
	
Before long its view approached the sunset, and The City. From this high it looked like a blight, a cancerous growth that had consumed nearly half a subcontinent. Its tall towers cast shadows visible even from space, like those of the mountains. One red light shined brightly from its center, gleaming outward. A reminder for all to see: we are watching, we will care for you, and we are never going away.

Just as the beetle has to watch out for the bat, so does the bat for the owl. As it happens, I&amp;rsquo;m inside the owl&amp;rsquo;s nest.  

It was unexpectedly easy to break into the Archival Section and to avoid the guards on my way to Storage 2D. My heart is pounding, my fingertips are tingling, my ears are throbbing.  

Despite being trained to have deft hands, I fumble with the blanket in my backpack. Too careful takes too long, too hasty makes too much noise. At last I finish wrapping the reel cans and check my watch &amp;mdash; not long until sunrise and my sneaking night is not over yet.  

I&amp;rsquo;m reaching for the doorknob when I hear soft voices in the corridor. I freeze &amp;mdash; the Pauldrons aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to make rounds inside the Section. Do they know I&amp;rsquo;m here? Have I been set up?

Someone twists the knob from the other side as the beam of a flashlight illuminates the crack beneath the door, leaving me desperate with no more than seconds to disappear. I manage to hide just as two beams start sweeping the storeroom, two pairs of round goggles darting from side to side in search of something &amp;mdash; or someone &amp;mdash;, but somehow they can&amp;rsquo;t hear my heart. Cold sweat wells inside my gloves as I try to calm myself by repeating that at least I won&amp;rsquo;t die an ignorant. They&amp;rsquo;re now across the room, their backs to me, and I have less than a finger snap. 

Breathless, I slip out.

Those people were almost completely wrong.

He wasn't homeless, although he liked to think himself as such. But he did have a home, a place where he belonged. But it had stopped existing years ago.

He also wasn't crazy, he was just happy all the time. This might be hard for some people to understand, given his social status and his financial predicament. But what do they know?

He DID buy liquor with his money, but he wasn't a hard drunk. He only drank Bearhuggers' Whiskey. despit ebeing named as such it is not a whisky, but a black liquid with gold flakes, probably classed as a liqueur. It is not, apparently, any more popular than you'd expect. It's a classic example of those bottles sitting on a high shelf over most bars, glowing bright colors but never being poured. 

It was also very expensive, for which Reese had to regularly water it down.

He didn't know it but a lot of his inebriation was placebo.

He was almost there now. The sudden brightness of the neon “JJ” sign almost blinded him. It put his arm forward to cover his eyes.

It was a small place. The motel was half-timbered and dilapidated from JJ’s main house. He was probably asleep by now. He walked across the single story modular lodge upfront. Going from one end to another, he looked for the number 201, as was on his key.

‘198, 199, 200…Ah.’

He put the key in the lock, opened the door and went in.

Looking back, he probably should have slept in his cardboard box.

I feel my story may be too confusing (I'm not worried about how casual it is).*

The butterfly effect, right? Everything you do, every choice you make, everything that happens to you affects what happens to you eventually. That’s common sense. So then perhaps when something out of the ordinary happens, it’s not so strange that events following it aren’t the same. It could be as simple as a change in the way you think. It could be that you have to drop the kids off at school now because your husband died. When the initial event occurs, your life after that is potentially altered. When your husband dies, it’s no surprise that you have to deal with the day-to-day things that he used to do. 

In the summer following my freshman year of high school, I was 15. I didn’t have a job and considering the small town I lived in, there wasn’t much to do that I hadn’t already done a million times. Because of that, I frequently opted to stay home instead of going skating or bowling or dancing again. So at about midnight, I was at home reading. 

I’d been attempting to finish my summer reading assignment so I could pass the book along to a friend. I’d been downing glass of tea after glass of tea trying to get through the book. I had dishes all over my floor from living in my room trying to finish the book. As any book I’ve ever been required to read, I wasn’t enjoying it. I sat it upside down and left my room to go use the bathroom. Right in front of the door there was puddle. I slipped and hit my head on the door casing hard enough to leave a dent. I lied in the puddle for a minute or two in quite a bit of pain, wondering why no one was getting out of bed to see what had happened. My fall was quite loud, I expected at least my little brother whose room was right next to the bathroom to come check, but nothing. I stood and shook my head to see if I had a headache. Nothing. So after leaning on the wall for a second to regain my balance, I went into the bathroom, peed like I needed to and went back to my room. 

Everything was normal. The book I’d been reading was closed on my dresser where I always left it. My room was in the tidy shape I usually kept it. I turned my television off and went to bed. 
The next day I awoke at 2:30 in the afternoon. That was strange considering I had an alarm set every day to wake me up at 6:42. Not to mention, I usually can’t sleep with any light coming through the windows. 

I took it for what it was. I mean, I guess I’d suffered a head injury. I’m no Doogie Howser, but I suppose a head injury could make you sleep longer and deeper. I went to the kitchen to find several pieces of cinnamon toast left on a plate for me. I ate them and went back to my room to sit in bed and read. 

At around six o’clock, my older brother picked the lock on my door, just like he usually did, and yelled at me to get up, that we’re getting water, just like he usually did. So just like I usually did, I complied. I got out of bed and put pants on and off we went. I didn’t think a thing of it until we got back home.

 We lived in west Texas and the tap water tasted like a swimming pool, so we’d go and fill up jugs of water weekly. My brother would collect enough change to fill up twelve jugs while I packed them into the back seat of his Bronco. Same routine, every week. The details that I’d missed were outside. The sky, the weather. This was July in west Texas. It was in the upper 90s every day, and it never rained. However, when I went out there, it was 60 at most and the sky… I can’t think of a way to describe the sky except for that it looked like a combination of every type of weather we ever got there at once. All the different kinds of clouds, all different shades of blue, there was wind, but there was no wind. This was happening, but I thought nothing of it? 

So we filled up the water jugs and returned home and I went back to bed to read. I looked at the clock. 6:34. I read two pages and looked back at the clock. 9:02. Again, I thought nothing of that. However I did slide back and think about how much I’d wasted my day. Not an uncommon feeling when I’d slept through most of it. So I thought, what have I done today? Well, I got up, I had some toast, I did my usual morning routine, I go extremely bored of my book and got up and danced, I listened to The Quiet Man soundtrack, I took a bath, I had chicken fried steak for dinner, and now here I am. Okay, well maybe I haven’t been as lazy as I thought. But... did I actually do any of those things?

I didn’t bother to check and see if The Quiet Man was on top of Days of Future Past (the only album I ever dance to) in my pile of LPs. I just turned the light out and went to bed.

My life went on. No big deal. I never did finish the book, but I did pass it along to the friend that needed it. Summer marching band two-a-days started. School started. Everything was normal. My schedule was almost exactly the same as it had been the last year. Only really strange thing about that was that there was one band period. For the last month of school, the band directors had been going on about how they were separating it into two periods. Yes, yes! I even remembered auditioning for first period band! I spent my summer worrying about if I’d made it! Oh well. I liked the band all together in one period anyway. I was dreading the separated band thing. 

We did morning practices, just like last year, which they were going to quit. I hated the show, it seemed incredibly uninspired and I swear we used the exact same visuals we used last year. I just figured the guy who drew the dots got into drinking or something. 
I guess I made it through sophomore year, through junior year, and I suppose I must have graduated. And considering my job, I must have graduated college with either journalism major or an English major. 

I went home from work one day. Nothing out of the ordinary. Whether it had ever happened before or not, this was my routine and I knew it. I took all these unfamiliar roads as if I’d taken them every day of my life. 

I made it home. Home? It felt like it was supposed to be home, but I’d never been here before in my life. I parked the car and walked to the front door. I lifted the keychain that my car keys had been on and put one of the many unmarked keys in the lock. How did I know that? I’d never been there before! But that’s not what I thought as it happened. Nope. I just walked into this beautiful home. I felt a great sense of pride for it.  And as I well should have! All the work I’d put into it. Work, I’d realize later, that I didn’t have any recollection of doing, but for now, I was perfectly content. I went into the kitchen and started cooking. Soon, the front door opened and a familiar man walked in. Oh, Robert! I’d had the biggest crush on him. Seeing him then, as I remember, I felt differently for him then I’d ever felt for him. But that felt totally normal. 

I don’t recall us speaking, but my memory seems to be telling me we did have a conversation. 

I suppose life went on as normal again after that. How would I know? Looking back, I don’t think anything happened between then and the next memory I have. 

It was dark and rainy. It was seven o’clock. Robby ought to be home any time now, I thought. And dinner is almost ready! I’d had the day off of work. I was home, knitting. Strange, being left handed, I was told by everyone that I couldn’t knit. Of course, that thought didn’t come until later. Suddenly, someone knocked at the door. I carefully put down my project and walked to open the door. Soaking wet police officers. 

“Are you Edith Zimmerman?” the officer asked. 

I nodded my head. 

“Wife of Robert Zimmerman?”

Again, I nodded my head.

“Robert was in an accident. We need you to identify the body.”
I felt nothing. I wasn’t sad. I didn’t miss him. I didn’t even feel bad about that. 

I looked down and sighed. 

“Ma’am?” the policeman asked.

I looked up at him. He was holding out a sheet of paper. I took it in my hands. It was handwritten. It looked like my own handwriting did in high school.
 
“Edie, you need to wake up. It’s very important that you wake up right now, Edie.”

The last thing that happened was that I looked up at the police officer again. And then… well, it was kind of like one of those time jumps, except it was sort of different. I was now lying in a hospital bed, struggling to open my eyes. 

A much older version of my mother and father were wiping tears from their eyes. They were telling the doctor that they’d decided it was time to pull the plug. The doctor nodded his head and walked to the bed I was lying in to check on me. He saw that my eyes were open and seemed very excited. He summoned my parents over. My mother started crying even more and my father just looked at me in awe.  
 
I didn’t understand. This was a different feeling. It didn’t feel like I was supposed to be here, like I’d done something to get here like all the other times that it seemed like I just happened to be alive at that moment. It was all a different feeling entirely. 


*In case you're wondering, I did fall, hit my head, leave a dent in the door casing and no one helped. I didn't have a head ache, and I did get up at 2:30 the next day. The weather was weird, I did get water with my brother, I did get down to Days of Future Past, and I did later listen to The Quiet Man soundtrack. I did also have chicken fried steak that day.*

I waited on the edge of the Rabbit Hole, not quite sure at what convoluted reality this dark chasm would lead me into.

On that precipice of fate, I could feel the wind blow through my hair, it was cold and eerie. 

Destiny was calling out to me.

But still I stood, on the doorstep of my future, unfocused and afraid. 

I was still the child I had desperately tried to run from.

The towering Goliaths of metal and glass. 

The endless corridors of concrete and poverty. 

The overcast skies, forever swirling in that milky-gray twirl.

An ominous hatred stirred in the air.

The ambiance of shit was strong.

This was New York. Home sweet home.

My apartment faced the Hudson, and all I could see was that river's dark waters and foreboding nature. Across the way, New Jersey rested, bright with lights, but quiet.

That first night, my past haunted my dreams. 

Christ, bleeding and dying.

My mother, dead in her box.

The doctors, with their syringes and pills. Their PhDs and phony smiles.

They all made me scream.


I found a job at a local coffee shop, busting tables for 5 an hour. 
The owners fed me and treated me well. I guess, in a way, my eighteen year old charm reminded them of their son. A faded, jaded, washout wannabe.


I went for walks for hours on end, oblivious to the world around me, encased in my own private bubble. 

I saw many things.
Prostitutes.
Dealers.
Murders. 
Robberies.

The streets ran red with blood and the poison that was our world made that red run deeper and faster.

I was just a humble observer, an outsider to the madness. I watched with a weary eye, this convoluted delirium, letting this dark animosity pass before me like the tide along a beach. It pushed and pulled, and I stayed out of the current. But eventually, everyone wanders too far into the swell.

There were five of them.

They pushed me. They beat me. They broke my wrists. They shattered my pride.

Blood ran in the streets.

Tears streaked my face.

I begged for them to stop. I pleaded for mercy.

They laughed, cold and shrieking. The punches continued. More kicks ensued.

The pain was nauseating. I couldn't feel. I couldn't see. I couldn't hear.
Please, just fucking kill me.

Let it end. Please.

There was a bright light and I reached for it. It curled close to my chest, like a lost puppy, and I embraced it.

A warm blanket of solitude enveloped me. 

I fainted.


I couldn't help adding my blood to the soap and water concoction. My wounds were still fresh, and now pus was starting to bleed along with the blood.

But I ignored all this.

I dabbed the cloth into my bucket and started busting. No had noticed the faint red tint of the tables. Yet.

But no one cared. 

People ate their egg omelets. 

People drank their shitty coffee. 

People paid their bills and left for work. 

Life continued normally, but I wasn't.

I didn't sleep. I didn't eat. I didn't talk. 

I was just that fucked up druggie. 


I came out of an empty dream, black and nothing else, when I first saw her face.

It was midnight and I had taken a seat in a nearby booth, alone. I stirred in that cheap, red plastic seat. I could feel a presence, an unknown entinity.

I opened my eyes and raised my head, slowly, expecting the lick of a fist or a tickle from a slap to welcome me from my slumber.

I winced in anticipation.

But no, none of these things sat across from me. Instead, it was a girl.

She was the most beautiful thing that I had ever seen. Her simple curves. Her flowing, blonde curls. Her innocent, loving eyes.

She gave me a look of sorrow, and I stared back, emotionless. I knew my eyes told the story.

We were silent for a moment, waiting in hushed tension.

""Hi,"" she started.

""Hi,"" I answered, unsure.

""I've seen you around here before.""

""I work here.""

""Yeah, I noticed that, you clean the tables,"" she began, then paused, lowering her eyes, ""You do a pretty shitty job.""

I was still mesmerized by her beauty, but I did not show it, ""Thanks. It's nice to see that my work doesn't go unappreciated.""

More silence. 
She was trying to figure out what to say, and I merely watched her. Half dozing and half oogling.

""You-""

I broke in.

""Hey.""

""What?""

""What do you want from me?"" 

She looked taken aback. Straightening, she looked me in the eye.

""I want to talk to you.""

I stared, absentmindedly. Was this some kind of a joke? What did this girl want? Who was she?

Her blue eyes flashed in the light and my stomach turned inside out. 

What was this feeling?

""Here I am,"" I managed.

""I'll be here every night, same time,"" she said.

""Why?""

I could see her hiding something, behind her charm. 

""Because you seem like you need someone right now,"" she answered finally.

From here, the Rabbit Hole looks dark and unsuspecting.

""What's your name?""

""Emily.""

""Kyle.""

Fuck it.

I jumped.

Wary, I&amp;rsquo;m breathless all the same. When I see the ornate glyph on the double doors to the offices of Mercy, a memory floods my thoughts.

My Mistress cupped my face in her tender hands, smiling at me but looking through me. My heart raced. Graduation Day had finally come and there I was in the Great Hall, receiving praise from the face of Harmony herself, my coronation for so many years of effort. Pride.

&amp;ldquo;Your work begins now, my son.&amp;rdquo; Her voice was music. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen your dedication only grow stronger through all these years, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve come to you to ask whether you&amp;rsquo;d be willing to do even more.&amp;rdquo;

I was about to burst. There was nothing I&amp;rsquo;d ever deny her.

&amp;ldquo;I know you have applied to be an Ear in service of the face of Mercy. He has shown me your progress. All your grades have shown me that compassion burns inside you, that it burns with such an intensity that it humbles even me.&amp;rdquo; She would&amp;rsquo;ve made me weep then and there if she kept talking like that. &amp;ldquo;But I have also noticed that you are brave and fierce, and we have greater need of that strength elsewhere. May we count on you?&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;Whatever you ask of me, that I will do without question. I serve harmony.&amp;rdquo;

Her smile widened as she placed her hands upon my shoulders.

&amp;ldquo;Then rise, my son, as a Hand of the face of Justice! May the wrongdoer cower in your presence, may truth and righteousness forever prevail through your deeds!&amp;rdquo;

Idiot.

That boy of dazzled eyes is no more. Their lie is no more. Their power is no more if the world hears.

It&amp;rsquo;s over.

Don't let the fear cascade, like an untimely flood that has found the weakness in your mental reservoir. Fear paralyzes. Fear intoxicates. It dulls the senses, driving you insane. Fight.

I try to shut the voices out, but this time they converge into a single agonizing symphony. I sway back and forth, my footing unbalanced and unsure. The room is spinning, oh no, not this shit again. I feel myself losing control. 

To the world.

To God.

To the voices.

Around and around we go, where will we stop, who the fuck knows.
Grip that pistol, ever so tightly. Focus.

Mr. McCay is a stocky individual, bulkier and more threatening than I anticipated. From behind his three piece suit, a fancy Rolex and clean cut exterior, I can sense a cold and calculating mind busy at work. All work and no play.

Unlike Mr. Clark, his home furnishing were modest, humble. There were no plush carpets or expensive artwork. No penthouse. No bravado. There was just class and ""enough""; nothing more, nothing less.

When he stepped through his front door, he was not alone. She was a beautiful youth with long, lushes brown curls, a pretty face, and arousing curves. 

I stepped from the shadows and raised my weapon. They looked at me, and I looked back. She was tense, but he seemed unsurprised.

I cut the foreplay short and she ended up staying for the show. 

They were both sitting on the bed to the master bedroom. Her eyes were wet with years. His were calm and dangerous. 

The view from his window was not spectacular, but rather, like everything else in this apartment, quaint. The Brooklyn Bridge was illuminated in the twilight of dusk, giving the scene an aire of serene beauty and grace. I took a breath of the crisp, winter's air and felt a sense of relaxation as the fresh air washed over me. I felt a rejuvenation of life. I paced back to the couple.

""What do you want,"" the suave gentlemen asked, a faint bead of sweat could be detected upon his brow.

I tapped the barrel of my pistol against his head.

""You.""

""Please, no, no, no, I beg you, let us be,"" the woman started to wail; her cries wouldn't stop, and they were joining to the voices, which were now a dull ache in the back of my head.

I let the cold steel lighty kiss her cheek. A gentle caress. Her wails turned into incomprehensible babble.

""Tell her to shut up.""

He obeyed. She wouldn't.

I cocked the hammer. Click-clack.

She was shaking, as if from a strong chill, but her voice died away. Oh the sweet, sweet silence.

""Thank you,"" I pulled the steel away.

""There is a safe under my bed,"" Mr. McCay said, ""the combination is 28, 3-""

""You know what I want,"" I spoke, I sounded unrelentless and cruel. Was this was what I had become? So be it.

""Don't do it in front of her,"" he breathed.

I nodded. Stark silence.

He looked into my eyes. ""Now?""

""No, some things need to be explained.""

McCay understood, ""Who are you?""

""A man with a gun and a destiny.""

""A destiny?"" Ka.

""Enlightenment.""

""So I take it you're Buddha?""

""It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.""

""Sticking feathers up you're butt does not make you a chicken."" This man was smart, a goddamn intellectual.

""You stand in the way of that path.""

""So I'm a sacrifice for the greater good.""

""An execution is not a noble thing.""

""That all depends on the reason.""

""Let's see if we can't figure that out,"" I said, motioning to the next room, ""Stand. And only you.""

The woman, hysterical now, took her seat once again.

Together, McCay and I stepped through into the living room. The moment we had all been waiting for. The final crescendo to this requiem.

I aided him to his knees and I tensed my arm forward.

""You know, I always did like the sunsets,"" McCay nodded toward his window and to the image beyond it. The Brooklyn Bridge bathed in a backdrop of red, orange, magenta, and the faintest black.

As he looked in the mirror at himself, he felt ashamed. Tall and thin, with a hunch in his back, the badge on his work shirt proudly revealed to every stranger what his name was, and where he worked, and, Nick thought, how much money he made. He resented that above all else-- people knew how much he made, and labeled him with the appropriate stereotype.

Nick had gone to school. He had gotten good grades. But he made few friends, so he came up with an idea which would allow him to meet people. His plan involved his consistently perfect exam grades and a few players on the football team, who, recruited out of the inner city's high school and given generous scholarships to attend the school, had no time between practice and parties to study. He was caught after he had made enough to pay for next year's tuition and was expelled. The football team, as Nick found out later, went undefeated that semester.

Nick rubbed the lingering sleep out of his eyes as he thought about this, which crossed his mind just about everyday. It was 2 pm. He sighed and made his to his car and drove to work.

""You're welcome."" Nick said. Without looking up, the stranger walked out, examining the recite, and not, as Nick resented, his handiwork, which lay inside the cart in nice little plastic bags.

""Go on break"". He said.

Nick nodded.

As he made his way around the store, a customer stopped him.

Nick raised his eyebrows. In front of him was a tall, large man, his arms covered in indistinguishable tattoos, bursting out of his shirt. He had a flat nose, as if someone had punched him and flattened it into his, full cheeks, which surrounded his small, dark eyes.

""Do you know where the milk?"" the man asked.

""Depends on who's asking."" Nick said, turning and walking away.

Every trek has an origin. Every revolution, a start. Mine was Mr. Clark.
But who is Mr. Clark?
Some would call hime a humble missionary. others, a modern day Messiah.
Mr. Clark was nothing but a businessman, and a good one at that.
And that silver spoon had been stuck up his ass since birth. He had surfed the green tide of wealth skillfully, but in the end, even the greatest fall. In Clark's case, that wave too big to surf was heroin.
When he recovered, Clark changed his life. And when that media spotlight fell once again over Clark's name once again, he did what any man finding redemption would do. He wrote books about himself. His six autobiographies and two novellas about the life and times of a converted millionaire plagued the Bestseller lists for months.
Slowly, the Mr. Clark epicdemic started to take root when the preachings started.
His speeches rang with euphoria. With passion. He reminded the people of what they had forgotten long ago. Hate. Persecution. Distate for any Interlopers in the status quo. These notions, of course, were shrouded behind a much grandeour image of peace. And people rallied in the thousands to hear him speak.
Soon enough, Mr. Clark was the new face of a nation.
He was more popular than the President.
He was the John Lennon of cable TV.
And I was Mark David Chapman.

The New York City skyline is a fantastic sight at dusk. A true specticle of human ingenious. The gigantic monoliths of steel are stoic guardians of the night. The endless corridors of concrete serve as ancient labyrinths. The people here are slaves too. To consumerism. To capitalism. To every ism. To all the isms.
But up here, on the fiftieth floor, none of these poisons can reach me. Up here, oh so high, in the apartment of Mr. Clark, time seems to slow.
I am sitting in one of those plush, European sofas. The kind that belongs in a suit of plastic, so that no dirt or grit can penetrate the oh so delicate lining. And it was comfortable. Along the walls, priceless paintings and mosaics hung and dark shelves of mahogany held what seemed like thousands of books.
If I had chosen to further excavate this trove, no doubt the bredrooms and bathrooms would have radiated a familiar sense of wealth and wonder. But I stayed on that couch and toyed with my pistol. As Durden would say, I was as ""calm as a hindu cow"".
Mr. Clark sat across from me in a similiarly styled sofa. He carried an almost swagger of ease about his person. Not a bead of sweat was seen resting on his brow. He looked a tad worried, if anything. Earlier, he had stumbled into the living room, where I was resting in the shadows, and shut the door with a resounding slam. He was alone because he didn't allow security within his home for privacy.
The barrel of a glinting .45 had flashed his attention immediately. When it said come, he came. When it said sit, he sat. 
""You've come to kill me,"" he said calmly.
""Yes.""
For a moment, we were both silent. Stark tension.
""Why?""
I gripped the plating tighter, ""Because you are a symbol of the wrong message. And when people lose something they find meaningful, they start to lose their minds.""
""So I take it that you're insane?""
I thought about that one for a moment.
""More like an agent of Chaos.""
Silence once again gripped us both. From outside, sirens and the chop-chop of helicopters could be heard vaguely. The sun had just dipped below the horizon.
""Come now, I implore you to see reason.""
I chambered one round. One shot was all I needed.
""Reason is beyond what must come.""
""Why?
I paused.
""Because the world needs to be saved.""
Mr. Clark shifted in his spot. And then he uttered something peculiar. Something unexpected.
""Just take the medicine. Except the treatment. Everything will be fine, I promise. The headaches will stop.""
""What?""
""Take the medicine, Kyle.""
He knew my name? I sat there silent. Chop-chop from the helicopters. Thump-thump from my heart inside.
""Shut up.""
""The voices will stop.""
I stood. Three paces forward. Mr. Clark tried to jump from his seat.
I raised my arm.
Flash. Bang. Lightening. Thunder.

Over the years we’ve spent together I’ve desired her, felt spurned by her, been frustrated and paralyzed by her, hated everything she stood for, but most of all, I have always loved her. Even now, years later, with the blood on our hands and the walls of the penitentiary between us, I believe I still love her in my own way.

I’ve tried over the years to forget what she was to me, to expunge her completely from my memory so that I could move forward with my life. I’ve yet to manage the endeavor though. I still spend long nights, teeth grinding back and forth, clicking with the succession of my thoughts as I reflect on that terrible summer and the years leading up to it.

From time to time I even get the urge to drop my tedious newspaper job, my wife whom I’ll never fully love, even my stranger of a daughter that I named for Margot. I could pack up and drive the six hundred miles back to Ames. I’ll sit at my desk and play it out over and over in my head, wondering what I would do when I got there.

Would I visit her home with the cracked blue paint? I can imagine walking to that red door, nerves firing off as I considered, reconsidered it, and never fully committed, instead shambling up to the home like the walking dead fueled only by the drive of nostalgia and the ill-placed hope that I could go back.

I’m not even certain who lives there now. Her brothers and her dad are long gone by this point, scattered to other parts of the world just as I was, all in the hopes that the distance would change our past, help us forget.

Maybe I could drive through the campus and find the right long-haired kid with the right connections. Twenty bucks and a tip for helping out an old man should do it. Twenty bucks and I could revisit my…our old habits, living out the wearily ecstatic dreams of my youth. Now the chemicals would leave me more wasted and worn than before. I’m just a desk-jockey now, ill-equipped to handle the rigors of such childish escapes and yet the urge is still there, running through my arm and creeping through my veins.

The doctors, the whole long string of them, have come to no consensus on what I should do. Take solace in the life I have, one says, leave it behind you. Write about it, purge the memories with your pen and paper which are your craft, says another. Visit her says the most recent, and damn him for the suggestion.

Thirty years its been. Thirty long years and yet yesterday. What would I say to her now? What could I possibly say?

It tasted like a mixture of powdered milk and fertilizer, and the abundance of the pulp was not anything near your average serving of fiber. One of the eldest was pouring a clear liquid out of a clay-cast urn, into husks. When he finished, he raised the clay vase to his lips, and drank.
He spat a generous amount into the fire, clearly to prove that it were fermented in some form, then continued to pass the husks around counter-clockwise; the three began to sing.
 
When I began this journey, it was upon the consideration of my grandfather’s advice.
He’d approached me during thanksgiving dinner the year prior. He told me that he had a strong sense of imbalance when we had first shook hands upon his arrival, and couldn’t rid himself of the foresight he accrued shortly thereafter.
 
My wife and I had been happily married for the better half of a decade, and our family was flourishing. Our daughter was an honor roll student, and was well enjoyed by her peers. The relationship between my wife and I had been nothing short of conventional, the few arguments we had gotten into, were futile in meaning.
Both of us had a steady income, and there weren’t any foreseeable problems.
 
Yet, when he approached me, something in the bottom of my being acknowledged the warning with such great intensity, that- to this day, I still can’t quite decipher whether or not what came to pass was self-fulfilling prophecy.
 
As I drank down the husk, I recalled my grandfather’s final advice he’d given me just the week prior, after he was diagnosed with a bout of pneumonia which proved to be fatal.
“Action shapes destiny”, he told me, “But more so, thought shapes action”. As I pondered the implications of what I’d just heard, he continued on, in order to solidify his message: “And most importantly, to choose to do nothing is still a choice in the eyes of the universe”.
 
I HAD chosen to do nothing; I’d become content with my stagnant lifestyle, and had spent ten long years, refusing to see that I’d stopped growing, stopped learning.
I do not regret getting married, or the idea that I produced a beautiful daughter whom I’m infinitely proud to call my own, but the fact remains that once it came to pass, I’d lost everything of the free spirit that I was in my younger years.
 
Once the divorce came, I had lost so much of whom I once was, that I became a shell. Work became a menial task that had no reward, and life outside of work was nonexistent.
 
I’d become a ghost.
 
Except that my grandfather had insisted on keeping contact with me throughout the entire period.
 
I finished the liquid, and placed the husk into the flames as following the motions of the others. The proofed drink hit the lining of my stomach with a ferocity matched only by the blackening edges of the husks within the pit.
 
As my stomach embered, and the shaman sang, I lay back on a flat rock that protruded the earth, almost begging to support my heavy head.
 
I watched the universe give up its nature.
 
I felt as attached to the dead earth at my back, as I did the infinite expanse that lie before me. As the forests and flames of my peripheral vision began to recede, their nature was encompassed in this phenomenon, and all at once, I was enveloped.
 
The earth was travelling at a rate that seemed to be adequate with the assumptions made by astronomers of the early eighteenth century, as the limbs of the cosmic expanse held her like a newborn.
I relished the sensation, as my vision folded inward, and I could see my wife, in her rocking chair, soothing our newborn back to sleep. Soon, there was nothing but attunement.
 
My vision adjusted, and the night was ablaze with life. I could remember so vividly this image, as though I’d created it with my own being. From behind, my grandfather spoke. “It’s miraculous, is it not”, I reeled my head to see him, as alive and healthy as I remembered from my childhood. “They believe it’s the womb from which all of life begins; and the one which we return to, when we leave here”. I was stricken. I could remember so clearly this night, this conversation.
 
“But Grandpa, I thought babies came out of their mothers?”
 
In a form of Déjà vu, the question passed my lips as though the instance were streaked in time, a permanent resonance, meant to aid in the foundation of a destiny.
 
As we reenacted this memory, there was a look of knowing in my grandfather’s eyes.
A sense of rejuvenated fire, that had once and many times been subdued by worldly endeavors, only to rekindle itself stronger, proving it should never be squelched by such frivolities as life.
 
“My boy, of course, But you must see. You must learn, that deep within all of us, is an immortal spark. And that spark carries everything that you have, are and ever will be”. “Like your soul”, I asked.

 “Precisely, and while in flesh the one that gave birth to you is your mother, this miraculous cosmic ballet is all of ours, always. And with the respect and adoration you show your mother, you shall never forget to show her the same. Through, in and of we live eternally connected by this beauty”.
 
“I wish I understood. I know I do somehow, but I have a lot of questions.”

 “That’s the beauty of the life we’re given, that we don’t understand, that we can ask questions. This is a school my boy, never stop learning”.
 
The thought of my mother began to become increasingly prevalent, and for the first time in a while I wished I could call her.
 
With a sense of blinding abundance, the view of the sky that night faded, as a bell began to ring in the background.
 
“Get your lazy ass out of bed, before I call the truancy officer to do it for you!”
“Damn it Mom, Its only 6:55, I’m not going to be late.”
“Don’t you dare talk back to your mother like that, you ungrateful little shit” came a voice from another whom I’m not sure, considering I made little effort to remember their names. None of them were good enough for her.
 
A hand grabbed my neck as to tear me from my bed, and suddenly, I awoke.
I sat up, startled, looking around. The three elders were in a form of deep trance that seemed unshaken by my rather forceful awakening. None moved.
 
I tried to stand, and run, my adrenaline still rising do to the violent moments passed. I collapsed, and vomited. My entire being felt as though it had been violated and a sickening shake began to take over.
 
I was dying.
 
I crawled back to the rock and fire, trying to scream. Even to just speak, I couldn’t.
None of the others were opening their eyes. I couldn’t breathe, it was as though I’d been thrown into a pool, and couldn’t surface. Every fear imaginable passed through my mind as I lay there eyes closed and teeth clenched. Was I drowning? How? Had I fallen into a puddle of my own waste? It’d be rather fitting, I suppose.
I exhumed a final breath, and let go.
 
Like centuries, darkness enveloped me again. This time there was nothing. No sense of one in all, no attunement, no cosmos. Just darkness.
I tried in every way to focus my vision upon horizons which didn’t exist.
Nothing would bare results, I gave up again.
 
As though being pulled through a vacuum, I began to fall, not knowing which direction I was going, or if there even were a notion, when suddenly, I was stopped dead, staring directly into the naked eyes of myself. Both of us took a step back, and in mirror fashion, analyzed one another, until my doppelgänger produced a blade and sent it shattering through my solar-plexus. I gasped, and fell to one side, and upon my decent, witnessed him also forcing the blade into his stomach, and carving from hip to hip.
 
He burst into a spectacle of cosmic regeneration, a form of pure energy that enveloped me as it had before, with a sensation tenfold. An infantile sense of confusion and wonderment filled me, as powerful as my grandfather’s words, and as innocent as my questions.
 
I broke into tears.
 
My sobbing became a distant sound, until they felt as though they were no longer my own.
Soon they were my mothers. As though she were miles away, I could just make out her figure sitting in her rocking chair, alone.
 
I did everything I could to get closer to her. She looked just as beautiful as ever, although she was stricken with such sorrow that I could not acknowledge the beauty. She was drinking, and remembering old photo albums.
 
She had often called me on such occasions, out of desperation. And more often than not, I’d shunned her notions as drunken breakdowns, or overemotional late-life complications.
It became clear to me that these were just about the only times I’d had contact with her during my marriage.
 
I was stricken with an unending wave of guilt, and self-loathing. All those years, I’d neglected our relationship. I’d become so involved with supporting my own family and keeping our life stable, that I’d stopped giving her the adoration and attention I did when I was young.
 
I spent my childhood preventing her from ever finding love of her own, and once mine came along, I’d left her with nothing. I couldn’t bear to be in my own skin, this sudden clarity was sickening.
I resolved to get as far away from myself as possible, but something forced me to focus even harder.
 
I caught sight of a photo of my daughter and I, it was just moments after her birth. I was holding her in a rocking chair as her mother slept. I was crying.
 
They were proud tears. 
 
The still frame of the moment shattered. My disgust was suddenly inundated by the memory of that day, and in a torrent of blindness, I couldn’t quite locate where my heart was.
I was lost in a multitude of tides, all of which converged on my being. I looked up at my mother, her face still wet, but her tears resolved, she caught my gaze.
 
She was as lost as I.
 
We shifted our eyes back towards the album, and found that we were staring at my grandfather.
It was in the hospital, the day before he passed. My mother and I stood at his bedside recalling all the times we’d had together, some of which, I wasn’t around for, being she was just a child. And likewise, a few were especially significant between just us two. It didn’t matter, we shared them all as though it could have been anyone.
 
Before he passed, he had asked her if he could speak with me alone, and she agreed and left the room to us. He knew I’d heeded little of what he’d said at the family holidays, but also knew how I’d handled everything following the divorce. I’d done little in the way of making sure to keep a strong relationship with my daughter, and was deep in a well of complacency.
 
“Doing nothing is still a choice in the eyes of the universe” was the last advice he’d handed me before his hands went limp, and his skin flushed of color. I broke down.
My eyes opened momentarily, and I caught a glimpse of the slightest sunrise, over the horizon laden with pines.
 
As I tried to figure my surroundings, I heard my daughter’s voice, “Mom’s it’s only seven o’clock, I’m not going to be late, don’t worry!” Instantly, I felt inclined to intervene. As I began to threaten her allowance, I realized that there was no one but the almost-dead embers of the campfire to heed my threat.
 
The sun broke through.
 
As I tried to stagger to my feet, a younger of the group assisted me. He pointed towards a stream about thirty feet away. In an effort, and with his assistance, we reached the shore.
 
I began to undress, as he stopped me, and tried to hand me a drinking husk. I gave a smile that merited all the possible substance I accumulated over the course of the past eighteen hours, and jumped in.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1371880074.0,,,True,t3_1gucvc,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1gucvc/critique_wantedshort_story_womb_2000_words/,

Hoping on entering this into a competition.,liamgunson,10,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1g1bes/critique_not_sure_of_my_title_16_year_old_from/,"I opened my eyes slowly. My head swam as light filtered into the back of my head, searing at the back of my skull, trying to break out. I squinted and tried to come to my senses, looking around a small space that was beginning to take shape around me. I heard a ticking noise coming from somewhere above me. A clock. I hate the sound of clocks. The ticking. The constant ticking. And the worst part about clocks? They were invented to tick, and because it is a clock, you know exactly when the next god damn tick is coming. It is a constant cycle that is impossible to break. I took my head out of my hands to stare at it. It was such a basic looking thing, a round piece of plastic, perfectly complimenting the rest of the basic looking room. The walls were painted some kind of greyish color and there were only a few pieces of furniture in the room. I adjusted my arse to try and relieve it of the knots that had been building up from sitting in a small, cheaply made wooden chair. What was I doing here? I couldn’t even remember. There was a buzzing noise coming from the desk on the other side of the room. There was a man there, who I knew was familiar, but couldn’t quite be bothered to work out why. The buzzing sounded vaguely like words of some sort, a bunch of incoherent noises that floated around the air, bouncing off the plain walls and then shooting back off around the room. The only place in the room that these noises didn’t seem to settle in was my ears.

“Austin?” The man clicked his fingers sharply. “Austin! Wake up. Jesus Christ, I’ve had patients that don’t want to listen to me, others who yell at me and don’t even allow me to speak, but I don’t think I have ever had someone fall asleep in every session.”

I looked away from the clock and towards the desk. It was a grand thing, I must admit. It spanned across most of the back of the room, sprawling across the simple polished wood floor. It had an elaborate carving of some sort on the front. To someone with a keener eye for art, they might have gawped over it to their hearts content, complimenting the owner on such a wonderful piece of furniture. To me it was just a bunch of engraved lines on a desk, a desk that did nothing but hold a laptop and some pieces of paper on top of it. Behind the desk was the man whose mouth the words were coming from. Unlike the desk, there was nothing magnificent about him. A tall, slim man with a stern face, topped with a tightly cropped set of balding grey hair and a pair of thin wire glasses that barely covered his cold, grey eyes. He began the buzzing again.

“Listen, I realize you do not want to be here, but if you just simply paid attention and er, stayed awake, then I could surprise you. Believe it or not, my advice does actually work; you only have to pay attention.”

What was this man talking about? What was I doing with him here in this boring room? I racked my brain for an answer, but all it gave me was a soft buzzing noise. The sound of emptiness. A brain that could only seem to take in what it was presently experiencing, and then throw it out the next day. I looked around the room for something to distract me with. There was a small window about the size of a dinner plate behind the man and his desk. It had a simple view of one of the walls of the adjacent building, a boring view for a boring room. I eyed the man’s face. He was looking at me contently, as if he was trying to work out what was going on in my head. I’m afraid that even if you could see into my mind, it wouldn’t hold an awful lot of valuable information, I thought, I can scarcely remember what I ate for supper last night. In fact, I can’t even remember where I was last night.

I went to move my head into my hands and heard a soft clinking, the sound of small pieces of metal crashing into each other. I looked down at my hands, and my mouth gaped open. There were a pair of handcuffs around both of my wrists, and they were fastened tightly. Hah! Well, this is definitely a revelation in this puzzling tale. Did I get too drunk last night that I can’t remember anything, and that I got arrested? I chuckled quietly. Surely it wasn’t often that someone wakes up in this situation. It was a funny thought.

“Something funny?” the man asked sternly.

I looked up from man hands and up at the man. His eyes seemed lifeless, unenthusiastic. He folded his hands over one another and places them on his desk, leaning back into his chair, never taking his eyes off of me.

“Could be,” I replied coolly “you tell me.”

It hadn’t meant to come at as cold as it did. I felt the iciness of the words on my tongue as the man shifted forward in his seat, placing his chin on his hands. He sighed and shifted some of his papers around with no obvious intent.

“Austin, do you know who I am?” he asked, turning his eyes back to mine, pressing further into the depths of my head.

“No.” I answered, shifting in my seat. “But, judging by these handcuffs, I have been a naughty boy. So my best guess is that you are some cheap lawyer that I have been provided with in order to protect my innocence. What is it that I’ve done wrong? Public disturbance, did I get into a fight, smash something on the street, or swear at a police officer? Please enlighten me on the vile breach of the Constitution that I have committed.”

The man simply socked his head upward and sighed. It wasn’t a frustrated sigh, or an angry one. It seemed… sympathetic in a way. “Austin, the reason you do not remember why you are here is not because of some drunken stupor you were involved in. I am not your lawyer; I am your psychiatrist, or doctor, whichever you prefer. I tend to believe that the word doctor is easier on the tongue. Can you remember at all why you would have any need for a psychiatrist? Try to think, Austin, think hard about it.”

I stared at this… doctor with a sense of disbelief. What would I need a psychiatrist for? Why would I not remember anything? Would I have known my name was Austin if he had not have brought it up? My brain swam with questions, yet it did nothing to help answer them. I felt and overwhelming sense of confusion and frustration, unable to piece together this puzzle. Only it wasn’t a normal puzzle, it was a puzzle that only contained half of the pieces, and the pieces that were provided were all from a different set. Nothing made sense, the room, the desk, the doctor and the handcuffs. The confusion began to grow, and then I began to panic.

I stood up and walked over to the wall behind my chair. My head began to pound violently, a constant cracking pain that seemed like all of the missing information I was looking for trying to break out of my skull. I heard loud buzzing, more words from the man behind the desk. Wait, who was he again? He was shouting loudly, telling me to take a seat. The pounding in my head became faster. Harder. I felt a trickle of blood run down my nose, hearing it make a small splashing noise as it hit the ground. Why was I bleeding? Was the information I was searching for so dearly finally leaking out of my head? I reached up and touched my forehead. I rubbed the warm pool of thick blood that had appeared there.

I wondered how it had gotten there. I turned around instantly regretted it. The sudden movement made my head swim, and I caught the edge of my chair to stop me from falling onto the floor. I could hear nothing except the buzzing from my head. There was a silent thud and I turned around. The door to the room had swung open, and the blurry outlines of two buff looking men were rushing through. I felt a tight grip on my right arm and I tried to jerk free. I swung with my free arm, trying to push the assailants away from me. Why was the man not helping me? Didn’t he say he was a policeman or something? Or was it a salesman? No, no. I think he was a lawyer. I felt myself falling. I was falling slowly, with the two men still gripping me tightly. My head hit the ground, and I thrashed around trying to get back up. One of the blurry figures pulled out a long slender looking object, and looked at it carefully. I felt tired, and lay on the floor limply, not bothering to fight against the two men that were holding me down. I felt a cold piece of metal against my right arm, and then it pressed into me. I felt a shot of some sort of liquid being injected, and my eyelids suddenly became heavy. I felt myself being lifted onto some kind of table, and the buzzing began once more. The buzzing sounded like it belonged to the man. I could work out the words, but no longer remembered what they meant. “…Started banging his head against the wall… Amnesia… Murderer… Psychotic”

My table began to move, I could make out some lights on the ceiling as the went rushing past. The two blurry figures were pushing me fast. They had what looked like white masks covering their faces, matching the white gowns that they were wearing. I tried to remember the man in the room. What had he said to the masked men? Amnesia? What does that mean? I couldn’t remember.

“My arm is malfunctioning” 

“Try reconnecting to it.”

“Didn't work.”
 
“Did you focus hard enough?”
 
“Not any harder than I should have to.”
 
“Try thinking more clearly.”
 
“I'm trying.”
 
Walters vexed Abrams by the way he talked. Always stating the obvious while he watched him work. After three months, it was starting to erode Abrams’s civility. He tried to ignore Walters while he refocused. The meditation techniques they taught in surgical residency came easily enough. But sometimes the interface he had to be wrestled with. In his mind's eye he imagined himself connecting to the robotic arm once again. Deep is his brain, the software responsible for processing his thoughts into actions was mistranslating, confused by the commands it received from the millions of cortical connections synapsing into it. The arm that Abrams could see on projection was not his. It failed to obey.
 
He was getting frustrated. He felt like he needed a vacation. Saturn was a popular spot this time of year. Liners would head out almost every week. He saw the commercials on the break room television. Five star restaraunts, space yachting, and planetside views. Only $5999
 
Again he tried to clear his mind, pushing away the stressful presence of Walters and replacing it with what he imagined the Rings looked like up close. A moment of inner tranquility achieved, he regained control of the robotic arm. The cutting began. 
 
“Not so hard. Let the blade do the work.”
 
Again. He already knew that. 

Think of the Rings. 

The arm was his once more and the blade traveled through tissue.
 
“Alright just keep cutting, this is already taking longer than it should have.”
 
Think of the Rings.
 
“Advances in medical science did nothing for this guy. Never took his medication. Tragic.” 
 
Rings again.
 
“Ok. Good job. Just pack it with the surgi-foam and let’s wrap this up. Which bed was he in?”
 
“4C”
 
“The chart says its 4D. Are you sure?”
 
Of course he was sure. Again with the questions. 
 
“Its LaSalle. Neuropathy. Right foot amputation”
 
“Chart says this is Moyer. Liver resection.”
 
Abrams looked away from the monitors and at the face of the patient. He felt sick. The coldness of the operating theater engulfed him. His mistake glared brighter than the lamps suspended above the severed foot.The machine arm whirred as it applied surgical foam to the inconvenient stump in steady, consistent movements. 
 
“Never seen you so pale before Abrams. I'll call Dallas to come up here and reattach that. This isn't going to be good for your malpractice though.”
 
Think of the Rings. Only $5999

“It’s all right,” Resh said. “They just want to ask you a few questions.”

It took all the calm she had left to step into the room and stand before them. Each of them looked as old as the Governess, if not older. They all regarded her like she had, with suspicion and distrust.

“Young lady,” said the one in the center, a woman with gray hair and a rasping voice. “Tell us who you are.”

Aderyn stood there, frozen in fear and uncertainty while they looked on, cold and impassive until Resh nudged her. She gave a short start and, not knowing what else to do, dropped into curtsy. It was a mistake but she realized it too late. The action was absurd in the jumpsuit and these people did not take kindly to being greeted like nobles.

“Oh get up,” the woman said with a snort. “We are no Revnari slavers, girl! Now tell us who you are!”

“Aderyn,” she said, knowing she’d given the same name to Resh already. That was a mistake, but one she couldn’t take back now. *I should have made up a name then! Something they wouldn’t know!*

“Do you have a family, a clan name perhaps?”

Groundlings often had a second name, much like a House name, only it was shared by members of direct lineage, not simply those given title and birthright. She thought quickly and shook her head. “No, they… they just called me Aderyn. My mother died,” she said, deciding the lie was easier if it was true. Her breath caught then, as if saying the words out loud made them so much more powerful. She was dead. Her brothers were dead. Kendrick, the only man aside from Ian to show her any kindness. Dead.

“It’s all right,” the woman said, her voice softer now. Aderyn realized she was crying, her hands held to her mouth as she struggled to breath through great, gasping sobs. She sank to her knees, all the exhaustion and anguish and shock from the past day hitting her all at once. “I’m sorry!” she said, shouting to her mother, her brother, the Queen, everyone, but only the groundlings heard.

“Don’t apologize,” one of the men said. “Resh, help her, be a good lad.”

He did and after a time she was felt something like control take hold. She stood on her own then and, carefully, told them a lie. Aderyn was fairly good at lies, it was how she escaped the worst of Caden’s attentions. Her oldest brother found her status as a Null disgusting, so she often wove stories that led him astray. She was never where he believed her to be. It saved her.

“My mother was brought in to serve the Lady Erisan on Hyperia but she was so pretty, red hair being so rare on Hyperia, that Lady Hyperion’s daughter took notice of her. She took her on as a personal maid and my father only saw her a few times a year. I wasn’t born on the planet, but on the Hyperion’s starkeep. Lord Ian, who was brother to my mother’s lady, always treated me well.”

Aderyn saw them shift uncomfortably in their seats and she added, perhaps too quickly, “But still, it was a gilded cage. Too pretty. I never got to go anywhere, just my little room and the cubbies for fetching wine.”

For a time, no one said anything and Aderyn began to sweat. The fear she’d held in check began again, starting in slow, anxious tremors in her stomach and grew until she felt bile in her throat. The five conversed quietly and she lowered her head, eyes shut.

“They always do this,” Resh said, whispering as he came to stand beside her. “It’s okay.”

She glanced at him and he offered one of those lopsided smiles again. To her horror, she found the look… endearing. She looked away quickly and concentrated on the toes of her boots. He killed your mother and the Queen. Only was that really true? Had he personally killed them or just been there? *Now I’m justifying it. Stop.*

They turned toward her slowly but as they did, they all rose. The woman who had shown her such compassion just minutes before looked left and then right before indicating Aderyn. “Take her.”

The two young men with weapons were on her in an instant. Giving a shout of protest, Aderyn struggled but they were too strong. They forced her to her knees with a blow to the back of her knees.

“Stop it!” Resh said. “I promised we’d help her!”

“There’s too much risk, I’m afraid,” the woman said and Aderyn heard no more as they dragged her from the room.

“Aderyn! It’ll be okay!” Resh said. She heard him fighting to come after her, then the sound of an argument and a door shutting with a loud clang. She was marched through a short hallway, then cycled through an airlock before being shoved into a small room. She turned as they released her, intending to bolt despite the futility of it. A door slammed in her face and she pounded on it, screaming to be let out. Only silence answered her.

As she bloodied her knuckles and screamed out one last lungful of fetid, planet-side air, Aderyn slumped to the hard, metal floor and pulled her knees to her chest. What happened? Did they see through her lie? Frustration replaced fear as she sat there, the small room illuminated only by a single light on the ceiling. She stood and paced before finally sitting on the cot, the only piece of furniture in the room besides a protrusion in the wall that Aderyn took for a toilet.

Well, she thought, calming herself with a deep, painful breath. *As long as you don’t panic, you’ll find a way out of this.* She covered her face with her hands, shutting her eyes and let all thought, all feeling drain from her like water down a drain. If living with her mother did nothing else, it taught her how to be calm in the middle of tense situations. Nearly every interaction with her mother was tense.

So she waited.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1d1zmu,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1d1zmu/the_blood_part_11_serial_space_opera_novella_any/,

To strike one of the Blood when you were not one was an act punishable by a public whipping and humiliation. She knew that, but as her hand struck him, she could not have pulled the blow to save her life. If she died here, her dignity would remain.

She stepped back and pushed passed him, suddenly unable to breath. The whole viewing platform was silent, all eyes turning to follow her. Mouths were left agape and women moved from her path. Men reached for her but she ducked beneath their grasps. Running now, she found the airlock and went through it, out into the open air of Zennir.

At first she did not realize what she’d done, but gulped great lungfuls of air and was grateful for the breeze that cooled her cheeks and neck. Stumbling away from the viewing platform, she started towards the ship and stopped immediately. I can’t go back.

Looking over her shoulder, she saw her mother’s face in the crowd clamoring to put on breath masks. Her body was wreathed in white ether, with great wings of power extending from her in an almost uncontrolled fury. The Queen was there as well, a halo of shimmering blue-white surrounding her. If I go back, I’ll die. She knew that, and she also realized that she was breathing air. Zennir air. It tasted sweet and fresh and smelled of grass and hot ozone from the ships.

And in the distance, men began to shout.

She looked towards the battlefield in time to see lines of groundlings charging one another, crude weapons in their hands. The knights on their metal steeds hung back, their lances still raised at the ready. They would not ride in until the first clash occurred, singling out enemies they could more easily run down. She saw Redrick then, though he looked like the rest of them, she knew him. He turned his head and looked at her. They were nearly a league apart but she looked for his eyes.

“I’m sorry,” she said to him, though her words were carried away on the wind.

Then another group of groundlings entered the fray. They appeared to have come from the forest beyond. The knights on both sides seemed confused. And then there was a flash of light and an explosion of earth erupted beneath Redrick’s steed.

Aderyn was breathless, her hands coming to her mouth as she saw her brother’s body fly from its seat. For a moment, he looked like he’d just been thrown but as she watched, his body came apart spilling blood and Ether and viscera. She screamed and screamed and screamed.

There was suddenly no more air, it was driven from her in horror and disbelief. When she tried to breathe, she found her airways thick and constricted. She coughed and fell to her knees. In the clarity of the moment, as the shock of the death and destruction came over her, she thought the grass was cool and wet and felt so unlike sand and hair. Wonderous. It was wonderous.

Knights and Steeds exploded, drawing her eyes back to the carnage on the field. Men were running about, firing weapons that emitted Ether like bolts of lightning. Where those bolts fell, her family died. Groundlings broke and ran, some joining the newcomers, others fleeing into the wooded areas beyond the field.

She felt her chest catch fire. Air, she needed air! Aderyn fought to breathe, to live, not wanting to die like this, not here amidst this horror. She caught side of Redrick’s helm rolling across the grass, shining and pulsing with dying, white light. A memory flashed: Redrick shoving that helm on her head, making her laugh wildly. “My little sister, so brave little sister!”

He’s dead.

The thought jarred her back, drew her eyes to the blood that spilled across the ground behind the helm to the eviscerated body beyond. Knights rode their Steeds across her vision, their Lances spearing the men who shot at them even as they were struck down.

And then the battle was turning, wheeling around toward her! The Knights abandoned steeds and Lances, drawing their Etherblades and powering on shields as they moved to protect the viewing platform. The others, Groundlings she inferred as they wore no masks, pushed them back in a wave with their terrible weapons lighting up the space between.

Her vision was becoming fuzzy and dark at the edges. She heard the shouts through muffled ears, saw it all through blurring eyes. She didn’t feel herself strike the ground, but suddenly the wet grass was against her neck and cheek, caressing her like gentle fingers.

And then they were on her.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1ap3pt,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1ap3pt/the_blood_part_6_a_serialized_space_opera_novella/,

Here's a sample if you don't want to click the link:
Of all the gods to exist in the ancient pantheons of the world, there are many that were said to have taken earthly form. From the manic squabbling of the Indian subcontinent, to the incestuous shorelines of the early Mediterranean, to even the gentle spiritualities of the native American, the homes of these deities number almost as many as their differing forms. Take Zeus, for example, god among gods of ancient Greece who, taking a break from exploring the sore orifices of his closest relations, once took the shape of a swan and forced his divine willy unto a swarthy, single-browed housewife and created a set of bastard children who both never knew their father or why their mother always had her hands under her skirt when she was near the bird feeder. There is Lord Vishnu of the Hindu tradition as well, who has more than a thousand names and has appeared throughout time in a collection of avatars, among them a pudgy, blue, flute-playing little boy who battled demons and a gigantic turtle that once churned an entire ocean of curdled milk. There’s Christ too, of course, but he just seems so boring compared to all these other heavenly dudes. Eternal love and selfless compassion are good and all, but call me when you’re morphing into animals and plowing chicks left and right, Jesus. Do you even lift, bro?

Alongside these many sided beings, there exists my grandfather...

Knights rode in on their metal steeds, their etherlances held at the ready. The tips of each lance ended in two feet of glowing Ether. She saw her brother Redrick, looking radiant in his dark power armor traced with white lines of Ether. His lance's tip was the same color. His Spark was like any other Medani. Caden would be there as well, but she did not look for him.


House Querra had arrived as well. Their Ether was a brilliant green. She saw a dozen knights on their steeds, all of them beating with that powerful light. It was beautiful to look on them. A knight was a powerful position even if they held no starkeep of their own. She would never marry a knight.


I will never marry even a steward. Even stewards must power a keep's lighting.


“Have the groundlings arrived yet?” The voice startled her and she bit back a squeak of fright. All that escaped was a sharp breath and she covered it with a hand. When she turned, a rather short, thin young man smiled up at her. 


Aderyn was not a short woman but most men towered over her. This one seemed merely a child, though he had stubble on his cheeks and chin. His hair was brown and disheveled and a pair of translucent glass wound from ear to ear, yellow Ether glowing at the edges. She had never seen spectacles like those before. 


“I'm sorry?” she asked, then added. “M'lord?”


“M'lord... m'lord,” the young man said as he sat on the edge of the table, causing it to creak. “No, no m'lord here. You must be Aderyn Medani mm?” He pointed at her back. “Only Null in the place.”


She felt her cheeks grow hot, her neck burn. Mother will have heard that. I will be strapped for sure. No words came to her and her promise to impress fled her mind. Charm was beyond her, so she said nothing and gazed into the field where the armies lined up.


“Yes, I can see that you are. No Ether Mark on your back, though that silly bit of silk does distract the eye. You look pretty enough, the dress does suggest you're a tad on the thin side but with children that will change.”


Aderyn refused to look at him, feeling the heat of her rage rise from her neck and touch her cheeks. The young man bit into a piece of fruit and chewed loudly. When he spoke, his mouth remained full. “Say something, I would like to know that your voice is pleasant to hear. Do you sing? You must have some talent at the least?”


She felt so stiff she could hardly move, much less turn to regard him. Closing her eyes she forced herself to think of Ian and their walks on Meda's shores. She had been so shy then, wanting to reach out and take his hand but never dared. He had smiled at her, all the time. No other men smiled at her the way he had. The memory of his smile loosened her joints enough that she could take a step back and look at him.


“Ah, she acknowledges me. I'd almost wondered if my mother had wasted her time.”


“I sing,” she said in her sweetest voice, even forcing a small smile that hurt to wear. “I can dance every court waltz short of Hyperion's Symphony most excellently, and the last fairly well. I read and write and can recant the ancient epics as well.”


The young man smirked. “So you're intelligent. Not always a sought after trait in a wife but since you're a Null I can look passed it. Tell me, in all that learning, did you find time to train in the seductive arts as well?”


Aderyn felt her cheeks grow hotter still and her jaw clenched tightly. How dare he. The Seductive Teachings were a private matter, given from governess to young woman. Such things were never spoken of and Aderyn would not divulge them here. Where Ian's smile had warmed her heart, Jessaline's hands and kisses had warmed her soul. 


“Good,” he said with a short nod, perhaps seeing that he had stepped poorly. “I had hoped so... being Null there will be little use for you beyond the marital bed. You will most likely have to bear several children until a true born is given... I've heard that. You are how old? Seventeen?”


Aderyn managed a nod, trying hard to hold onto that image of Ian's hair flipping in the breeze, blonde strands obscuring his eyes. Duwen Nevan, whom he must surely be, nodded absently to himself. “Very good, plenty of time then. You will, of course, not be my only lover. I will have others, as you would expect. You will treat them as they deserve, which is to say that you will submit to them. They will be your betters.”


He rose then and tilted his head, looking her over. Aderyn's rage built to such a level that she could have screamed. She would bow and scrape to courtesans and whores? Be nothing more than a lordling's plaything and child-bearer? Unable to help herself, she turned her head to look for her mother. Lyana Medani did not even spare her a look. 


His fingers closed around her chin and brought her face around so their eyes met. They were of a height and behind those spectacles of dancing lights, cruel brown eyes bore into her. In that instant she saw her life stretch out before her, a used, broken thing in a bed of birth blood and despair. 


His breath touched her cheek as he leaned close. “Your mother informed mine that I could take you for a test run during the War should I wish it.

Born into privilege,

No need to complain.

Yet these thoughts keep racing

Like a plague in my brain.

But will it ever stop,

This source of my rot?

I pray it will persist,

What a repulsive thought!

But pain is a blessing,

Or so I've been told.

Suffering through hardships

Makes one wise until old.

But I do not foresee

Me reaching old age.

Drowning in obsession

and it pays me my wage.

But its payment is scarce.

Nothing but a tease.

Every source of my pride
An effect of disease.


And there lies the problem.

How can I recover

When my perverted mind

Is my only lover?

The white capsules staring back at her had a quietness about them that scared her a little. They didn’t blink. But she was determined, and with one quick motion, used her teeth to tear into them, ripping them from their plastic restraints and set them free. Little white horses coming out of the gate, they were ready to rip through anything in front of them. She wanted them to rip through her. Her head was heavy with anticipation.

Her toenails scraped on the wooden floors as she made her way to the bed. This was the one place where she didn’t feel the weight pressing on her. The bitter taste that came with that morning’s events became soft and rounded here. She felt her heart rate slowing, and she closed her eyes. She could sleep for hours, and she did. 

It had stopped snowing when she woke up, and she felt herself being lifted out of bed by the unhesitating familiar arms of the bearded man.  She could tell that he was still feeling guilty about this morning.  She was glad he felt bad, but now he was taking her out in the cold, somewhere on that damn bike again. Together they had fallen twice in the snow. It was embarrassing the first time, and nearly tragic the second time. The falls had shaken her, and made her look at the bearded man differently. She hated to hear him apologize, picking at the scab just made it worse. And besides, it was too late for any of that. The horses ripping though her would see to that.

The bike stopped at the usual place across from the zoo. The cold was biting, and she was happy to go inside where people spoke in falsettos and smiled with their eyes. Normally, she relished the comfort that came with this place, but today something was different.  When the door closed behind her and the bearded man released his grip, the women were dripping with focus. Something was wrong. She felt a needle go in. Hold her still one of them said. And then it was over. 

The bearded man never liked making small talk. And waiting in the vets office for your dog to throw up is no time to make an exception. 3 minutes of silence was broken with the sound of her dry heaving. It cost 60 euros to make your dog throw up.  The Belgian girl apologized for leaving her bag unattended and allowing the small dog to eat her epilepsy pills. But the bearded man hates apologies; picking at the scab just makes it worse.

This semi-autobiographical novel (in progress) is about a young boy who, because of the death of his parents, has to join a notorious drug cartel, Los Zetas. 

This is the very first piece of fiction I've written since the forced journal entries we had to write in elementary school. Having said that, please don't be afraid to make my writing bleed. 



Chapter One

Padre Miguel, the priest of Jesus’ childhood, once told Jesus that there are no bad people in life, only those who have walked barefoot down a rocky path. His words did not resonate with him then and it would take ten years’ worth of bloody footprints for him to understand the significance of his message. 

Jesus Galvan had never been the type of child who asked for what he wanted. Even in infancy, his mother would wake in the dark hours of the morning to check on him and would find him awake, cooing to himself despite having a soiled diaper. Years later, in school, when his friends would gather outside during the lunch hour and take out their toys and marbles from their brightly colored backpacks, Jesus would never join, being fully aware of the emptiness of his own bag. 

Not even when he found himself being chased by Mario, the boy who had left school the previous year to work for his father’s furniture business, did he tell him to stop. Mario was well known for always looking for someone to use as target practice with this well-worn slingshot. 

Jesus ran with Mario trailing right behind him. One miscalculated step and he knew that he would be on the floor with welts on his back the size of coins. They ran past the mercado that was bustling with women out buying food for their husbands and children. Jesus knew that if that he could make it to the church entrance he would be able to run in. Although only being in school until his 14th birthday, Mario was no fool. There was no worst fate than being scolded by the red faced nuns that lived in the convent next door to the church.

The sweltering nature of the summer Dolores days started to breathe down Jesus’ neck. He was slowing down and the familiar feeling of his tightening lungs was beginning to consume his every thought. He fought with every inch of his resisting body to keep running. To keep running away from Mario and to keep running towards the church of the Santo Nino de Atocha. His breath kept getting shorter and more audible as panting turned into wheezing and wheezing became gasps for air. 

This is it, he thought. There was no use in pretending that he could last any longer and just as the steeped turrets of the church appeared across the street, Jesus fell. 

The crushed gravel that had gathered at the edge of the street tore across his cheek as his face hit the dusty road. His blood left a streak of bright red that contrasted frightfully against the ashen grey of the floor below him. Every attempt to draw in air was met with rejection and when he reached around to grab his inhaler that was in his back pocket  he felt the force of Mario’s weight on the back of his hand.

“Que paso?  Did  you really think you could run away? Jesus, you know you wouldn’t have been able to outrun me. With those shitty lungs of yours I’m surprised that you even lasted this long.”

It took everything that Jesus had to turn his heard around to meet Mario’s voice. From this angle he could see all the small scars on his knuckles from his many fights around school and peeking under his rolled-up school shirt were small circular burn marks along his forearms. Mario followed his gaze towards the scars and pushed his sleeve down while adding more of his weight on the Jesus’ arm that was pinned behind him. 

“What do you have there Jesus?” Mario sneered as he snatched away the inhaler from his grasp. 

“Oh, you need this right? I remember when you passed out in 3rd grade when we had to play football. Que pendejo, look at you. You can’t even breathe right now can you?” 

Jesus wanted to punch him. He wanted to curse at him. He wanted to face him straight on and deliver a speech that will leave him feeling guilt, cowardice, terror. But at the moment his lips were turning blue and his head was staring to pound against his skull. He saw Mario turn to face someone but he could not make out any of the words that he was saying. The world was starting to get fuzzy and the last thing he saw before slipping out of consciousness was the familiar face of Padre Miguel bending over him as he held the inhaler up to his mouth and brought him life again.

To be better, if only slightly, than your peers and hopelessly beneath your idols? What sort of hellish limbo is it to be put under the spotlight of Potenial? Whenever someone tells me my writing has Potential I feel like a person who is full of some terminal illness and being told reassuringly that everything will be alright, even as they attach tubes and needles and monitors to my quickly failing, quickly withering body. Potential. Is such a thing truly even discernable apart from the intent of kindness attached to its use? I do not think I'll ever know for sure, so until then I have to assume I fall short. After all, sweet words are meant only to fatten our egos and cushion our failures, and it is a practice I will take no part in.
 
Doubt must never immobilize your goals, self-imposed or otherwise. Sharpen your skills on every criticism and use that to carve a way out for yourself. Never let what others say be the final word on anything you do and always remember that you can do better tomorrow than what you did today.
 
It is the sense of the self that should motivate regardless of the nonsense buzzwords crafted to placate your sense of accomplishment. Whether or not everyone can benefit from this frame of mind I find myself in is yet to be seen, but I must take responsibility. It could very well be that Potential is not the slow acting poison for others  it seems to be for me. Whisper a few words of encouragement in my ear and complacency starts to set in like rigor mortis, and after a period of lackadaisical comfort the writer in me becomes nothing more than a sleeping corpse; lulled by the sweet sedative of promise. I think the biggest fault I find in the use of the word Potential is that it carries with it a sense of coming greatness, one that many might interpret as an excuse to stop challenging themselves. It is a word that one has to be exceedingly wary against so as not to fall victim to its influence.
 
 Whatever happened to rigid and unapologetic criticism? When exactly did our institutes for learning fall in step to the apologetics rhythm? I just do not find it a helpful lesson to cater to mediocrity and then display it alongside a true seminal literary work. No, not everyone deserves trophies, but it is not as though I’m advocating there be no positive feedback at all. Snobbery will get us no further than the incapacitating politeness found floundering ass-side up throughout our society; but a middle ground must be found. I am not unwilling to compromise, but do not attempt to put a pig in a dress and expect me to call it a beauty queen. Potential, as it exists today, is a non-answer, a red herring that can help only the upkeep of appearances and pride. I do not stand on the side of half-truths and false affirmations when dealing with flawed works of any kind. And I refuse to be led down a path laid out for me by some hidden word called potential, but instead make my own.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1000w1,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1000w1/on_potential_and_the_repercussions_of_politeness/,

	He awoke to the calming sounds of the river’s water lapping the shore.  A peaceful sound.  How did I get here?  He thought.  He crawled out of the river’s grasp onto a large smooth rock to collect his thoughts.  The night sky appeared serene despite the orange glow in the distance.  How far off is that?  Looks hellish.  He thought as the ringing in his ears subsided.  Where am I?
	As his hearing came to he could hear screaming.  Not the screaming of people, but bombs.  Numerous large aircraft flew overhead.  Something horrible was happening in the distance.  That orange glow, he soon figured out, was fire.  The city nearby was burning and under attack from the sky.  Large military aircraft dropping ordinance.  Napalm. High explosives. Something was seriously wrong.
	He scrambled to his feet to survey the immediate area.  Not a person in sight, just trees.  Some kind of metallic wreckage drifted past him in the river.  A plane?  A boat?  He couldn’t tell as it was too mangled.  Was that an aircraft’s wing or part of a boats hull?  The flames engulfing it made it hard to distinguish. It doesn’t matter at this point.  Got to get my bearings!  Bearings.  A typical military term when trying to find your way.  Am I with the military?
	Slowly getting to his feet on the slippery rocks, he looked down at what he was wearing.  Ripped BDUs.  A Battle Dress Uniform.  Military of some kind for sure.  Desert camouflage.  This kind of dress doesn’t fit a forest area.  He thought.  A loud explosion rocked the city nearby.  A large skyscraper seemed to slowly collapse in on itself.  An ear splitting roar followed as if a thousand elephants just perished.
	“Oh shit!” he yelled at the top of his lungs out of surprise.  “That sure as hell wasn’t natural.”  He made his way closer to shore.  Actual dirt.  He felt as if it had been a long time since he felt something that wasn’t sand.  He leaned against a tree to check his pockets.  
	Ok, I’m military.  Branch doesn’t matter at the moment.  Gotta figure out what’s happening.  What do I have?  Going through his pockets he finds an empty canteen, a M9 pistol with USMC crudely engraved on it with 3 magazines, a Kevlar jacket with a spent round in his chest, a pair of dog tags, but too dark to read, and a large combat knife.  No food, but I can manage.  I’m military after all, right?
	A frightening gurgling noise made itself known behind him.  He clutched his M9, turned the safety off and made himself ready for combat.  This place seems fucked, better be ready for whatever that is.  Fuck I hope it’s a dog or sick cat.  He got to his feet and aimed his pistol in the direction of the sound.
	“Who’s there?! Speak up or I’ll shoot!” He yelled, his voice cracking.  Another gurgling sound came from his left.  “Don’t make me do it!”  He has never killed anything in his life before.  He’s shaking.  His aim is unsteady.  Another gurgling being from his right makes itself known.  It sounds like three dying animals are making their way towards him.  Twigs snapping in increasing decibels.  Something is coming.  He flicks on the flashlight attached to his M9 like he was trained to do and aims straight ahead.  Military training takes over despite his uneasiness.  
	The gurgling being from his left shows itself and lunges at him drooling, gnashing its teeth, before he can react.  He falls back firing wildly.   Five shots ring out before the being falls lifeless on top of him, bleeding through the eyes.  Four rounds left.  “Holy fuck! Get off!” he yells panicked.  He pushed the first being off, scrambles to his feet and looks for the next.
	Aiming straight ahead again, he spots the next target.  This one he plainly sees is missing an arm and half it’s torso.  He doesn’t hesitate to empty the last four rounds center mass.  He stumbles back and looks in horror to see the thing stumble back, then continue after him.  Only five yards to drop the empty magazine and load another.
	He nervously punches at the magazine release missing numerous times.  Ten more feet, he can hear it stumbling towards him, teeth grating.  He slams his second magazine in, and fires as the being trips over a root.  The second one lets out a blood curdling yowl as it twitches and slides towards his feet.  It stops moving as pitch black liquids spew out the back of its head.  The solider readies himself for the last one.  The last one has gone quiet.  To your right, to your right! He yells at himself.
	He pans right with his flashlight excitedly, aiming his tactical light through the trees.  Where is it, where is it!?  Adrenaline continues to course through his veins.  Fight or flight?  Fight or flight?  I can’t fucking see it!  The heavy underbrush hides his last target.  Another large explosion rumbles through the city nearby illuminating the tree line.  Nearly out of sight, the last being is lit up like a Christmas tree.  The solider swings wildly far right and fires with his eyes closed until the pistol clicks empty.
	A soft thump.  The being falls at his feet in the dirt.  He slowly opens his eyes and looks at his last victim, releases the empty magazine, and slams in a new one.  Last magazine.  Nine rounds.  They have to count now.  The soldier falls to his knees trying to regain his composure.  His pants are warm.  He’s wet himself.  What the fuck.  
	He turns back to the river and dips his feet in, shaking uncontrollably, his large boots keep his feet dry from the river water.  Looking out over the river, the fires in the distance leave a shimmering orange glow on the water, and then he sees them.  Several bodies, dressed exactly like himself, floating down stream.  One body, missing both legs, screams bloody murder as he swallows a lung full of river water, letting out a horrendous roar before sinking beneath the surface.  
	The soldier takes off his helmet and vomits into it.  He watches as the city nearby continues to be bombarded with explosives before he passes out.

This is actually my first post in /r/KeepWriting, so I'm unaware of what the community would appreciate, but I'm fairly confident some sort of instant messaging room in addition to this subreddit would help everyone out.

My first inclination was IRC, but the overhead seems rather high for (what I'm assuming would be) a rather small average following, so I thought maybe the [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) network may be of some use here. For those unfamiliar, SE hosts a bunch of Q&amp;A sites covering a myriad of topics; most relevant is [Writers](http://writers.stackexchange.com/) (still in beta) and perhaps even [English](http://english.stackexchange.com/). We'd only be utilizing the (rather robust) [chat section](http://chat.stackexchange.com/) of SE. I created a sample room really quickly if anyone wants to test it out. Hit it up [here](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/4504/keep-writing).

Oh, even though clarification may not be needed, the reason I'm advocating for an instant messaging hub in the first place is because I think it'd really facilitate support (in the form of both virtual high fives and constructive criticism) and because I think it'd only further a tighter sense of community. Though again, I don't mean to impose, or to pretend like I'm some a regular here: this is my first post and I'm only trying to make a suggestion ;)",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1345015318.0,,,True,t3_y8qwl,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/y8qwl/would_anyone_else_enjoy_an_accompanying_chat/,

1342666819.0,7,self.KeepWriting,wspux,Short Excerpt from Novel in Progress (600 words) NEED FEEDBACK,Dworks,7,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/wspux/short_excerpt_from_novel_in_progress_600_words/,"The overwhelming December coldness that had permeated the masses bleached every Caucasian face walking down the streets of Toronto a disturbing shade of white, allowing blemishes and impurities to display themselves more fully. Even Janet had lost her unnatural good looks under the backdrop of the stinging Canadian winter. To make matters worse, both Markus and his aforementioned therapist were afflicted by a miserable cold that no cough drop, Kleenex or Advil could remedy. 

As Janet squirmed around in the plastic seat to get into a comfortable position for a nap, Markus covered his hand with his sleeve and rubbed it under his nose. He managed to scrap off a piece of solidified snot and with the same sleeve, wiped a spot on the foggy window to look out at the city and, in part, to get the sticky green piece off his sweatshirt. There was an announcement that the heating system on the train was experiencing some issues and that VIA rail sincerely apologised for any inconvenience this may have caused. An elderly man behind Markus murmured to his wife that he knew they should have just taken a bus. This was what every unfortunate person on the train was thinking. After a quick glance to see if Janet was asleep or not, Markus returned to staring out at the rest of humanity who were forced to battle with the elements outside. Every one of them was visibly suffering from not only the same physical illness he and Janet had, but the similar seasonal depression he was in. Markus had at once discovered on that train ride that he, as an individual, had reached new lows. Before he could even begin hypothesizing what it was he would say to his parents and family, he took into consideration how he was unable to win over the girl of his dreams and that nothing would go the way he wanted it to. And so, as expected, Janet once again flew in and saved the day, taking Autumn’s place to spend the holidays with his family. Looking to his right, he watched her resting. He wasn’t sure if she was asleep or not. Her eyes her closed, but she kept clearing her throat and adjusting her position on her the seat. Her head was leaning on his shoulders. 

Markus all of a sudden felt overwhelmingly sorry for the poor girl. So sorry that tears formed in the corners of his eyes. So sorry that if she got up and asked him to move so she could lay on both seats, he would take off his coat and give it to her to use as a pillow and find someplace else to sit with only a thin sweatshirt on. Fighting back the tears, Markus began to take on every one of their tiny misfortunes as his fault. It was his fault that he gave her the cold, his fault that his shoulder was too bony and couldn’t provide much comfort for her head. His fault that he had to lie to his parents and Janet before even asking Autumn to come with him for Christmas and then drag Janet all the way up to fucking Barrie so he could lie some more. 

Markus was grinding his teeth now, feeling that old self-loathing return once again like an unwelcome old friend. It was his fault, after all, that things had to turn sour with Autumn. Markus was the one who gladly accepted that she had a husband in waiting and went ahead with their little affair before getting caught red-handed. 

As everything began to pile up one by one, Markus began neurotically blaming the cold weather and Janet’s wet socks &amp; shoes on him. It was his fault that he didn’t suggest she should bring boots in the first place.

________________________________________________________________________________________

Flavors of Thailand, found just in the center of the four districts, was a vision of a place that had once existed back home. They never changed their menu to modernize and cheapen what they offered, it was purely traditional. Sure, the chicken was expensive and as a paying customer it would probably take a lot of the girl’s newly acquired funds but this was a chance in a life time situation. This place always treated her like family, especially after her mother left. The two of them had actually eaten there the day before her mother left her in their hovel. That had been only a few years back and the girl hadn’t really bothered to look for her since then. This place was huge and had many secrets. 

After her mother’s disappearance the owners of Flavors of Thailand always offered the girl a nice discount on food. It didn’t make it any more affordable for a teenager but when she had the money then it didn’t injure her pocket as much. 

As usual, the manager and her daughter welcomed the girl with open arms, like they were greeting a child that had been far from home for a very long time. They sat her in front of the only window in the restaurant so she could see the streets outside. When she was a kid it had always been her favorite place to sit so she could see the horizon of small apartments, hovels and the persistent cloud of brown that hovered over all of them. Back in her naive days she thought this to be a beautiful view, something that surpassed the artificial sunrises and sunsets of the higher dimensions. Down here, you only got light or dark, you can never really consider them day or night. Such a thing no longer existed here.  

Today’s view consisted of a fast paced Saturday, it was shopping day for her dimension and many people were rushing to get the best deals of the week. Those that were slow to rise verses those that woke up before the Arti-Sun appeared made the difference between beef that tastes like the real thing vs. something that the seller didn’t bother to name or describe. 

The Thai restaurant was well known for its dealings in the upper dimensions and were able to get real chicken a lot of the time so the girl knew it was always safe to eat. She recalled a time when she ate a sample of aged artificial fish from a vendor. She had been sick for nearly a week. Good food was a delicacy here.

Outside the window the girl caught a glimpse of an all too familiar figure. She shrank down into her seat hoping that he hadn’t seen her sitting there. Sitting in the window was suddenly an incredibly bad idea, that thick brown waist coat with dark green slacks of his were impossible to miss. Today of all days, he appears in his teachers uniform. It was Saturday, a day in which the girl prided as her day of freedom from this unusual man. Considering his lineage and history he looked incredibly out of place in the slums of this dimension. The girl was sure that he only taught on this level for charity purposes. Education requirements never exceeded the knowledge of keeping the ship running and keeping the robots and dwellers alive. Especially if they lived in the upper dimensions. 

Luck was not on the girl’s side today. Their eyes met and in mere moments he was entering the restaurant. Nonchalantly he took a seat a few tables away from her but was angled so he had a clear view of her every move. The girl disliked this his man, no real hate was evident because at the same time she was curious. Every day in school he pushed for her attendance and progress but he ruled over her like a lord. She always felt that he looked down on her, which wouldn’t surprise her really. He was one of the fortunate that had money and lived in the higher dimensions. He had had showers, fresh real food and artificial sunlight that actually benefited him. Down here all she had was dirty sewer water, leftover food and the dim glow of the reality of her dimension. Although she strongly disliked this man he was only a couple years older and had proven that he had great generosity for the lowlifes of this place. It wasn’t uncommon for him to feed the entire class lunch or help buy new clothes for those that needed it. The girl has had to thank him several times for some of the clothes she wears. 

The girl’s food was brought out to her table and suddenly the horrible stenches of the street disappeared upon its arrival. The fresh pecans and vegetable medley with chunks of chicken made her stomach holler for its immediate digestion. Slowly, with intention to savor the first sample, the girl brought a spoonful of fresh warm rice with a piece of chicken to her lips. Her mouth opened to accept this package of wonderful and was immediately satisfied. From this movement, she saw her teacher move. He stood from his table and smoothly sat down in front of her window at her table. The girl couldn’t relate to the large smile that was on his face, as though he had achieved something that no one else had before. She wondered if he had poisoned her, but her stomach was hollering again for more of the Thai cuisine.  One after another spoonful was shoved into her mouth as her teacher watched. Steadily his smile softened but he continued to not say a word. Maybe he had known just how important this moment of eating had been or he could have possibly understood to never get in the way of a hungry girl. 

Only half of the plate had been consumed when the girl decided that she should stop before hating herself. She never wanted to gorge and become gluttonous like the higher dimension people. The teacher slowly reached across the table and took a light sip from the girl’s water, the nerve of some people.

“Mr. Hawkes, is there anything in particular you want from me today?” The girl asked calmly, trying to hold back a light burp. For some reason around this person she was self conscious about her manners. It could have been the imbued fear that all lower dimension people had of his kind. They’ve all heard the stories of people being taken in the night and either killed or forced into slavery because they may have offended an upper dimensional aristocrat. 

Mr. Hawkes stared at the girl hard with his green eyes. He thumbed and played with the perspiration on her glass of water for awhile before finally speaking, “Emi, you’re a far brighter student than what belongs down here,” He said quietly, “Before your final year of school, before they drag you off into the work force, I would like to give you the opportunity to join me in the higher dimensions.”

""No."" the girl named Emi said sternly, she didn't need to think twice about this, ""and please don't call me Emi, Mr. Hawkes, it's just Emilia."" 

The two stared at each other for while. Mr. Hawkes didn't suffer from the pale discoloration that everyone had down here. Instead it was the healthy flesh toned color that was evidence from the sun on the higher dimensions. And amongst all the grime of this underworld how did he always manage to stay so clean? After a few more minutes of their silence Mr. Hawkes simply nodded and straightened out his coat before standing up. He tossed a fist full of money onto the table, quickly saying that he would pay for her meal before he escaped from the restaurant.

Well...sort of. To keep it interesting, I'm kind of mixing fantasy with sci-fi, since most of what I write is sci-fi anyway and I've never taken a wing at fantasy yet.

I've written 7 chapters of the story so far, and it's going good. Some of the ideas I have implemented so far:

* Yes, there's elves as a race in my story, but the elves are the only race that is technologically advanced and 'cyberpunky,' with airships, laser swords, rifles, that kind of stuff.
* All of the other races are reptilian or mammals
* The main character is a runaway from a tribe that hides in the mountains/has never left the mountains
* There is no magic in this story at all, the combat is done through swords and shields (or fancy rifles for the elves)

I'm worldbuilding a lot with this story, and the story's plot, without giving too much away, has the elves as the story's main antagonist. basically, they settled on this world just a few hundred years ago, and none of the races like their tyranny, so it's about resistance.

---------------------------------------

My great grandfather left his house to his 12 grandchildren when he died. By the time I was born, it had been tidied and cleaned a lot, but hadn't lost that comforting clutter it had in the old photos. Piled up on shelves and hanging from the ceiling, rusted old harpoons and glass buoys and lanterns. Hanging from the ceiling, near the potbelly stove, was an inflated pufferfish.

A good third of the house was taken up by the game's room, which consisted of a full-sized pool table and a dart board. There was no way to move the pool table into the finished house, so the house was built around it. It was at that table, lining the coloured snooker balls and pushing them into each other, that I began to learn of things such as the conservation of momentum, friction,
elastic and inelastic collisions, all my little experiments to see how things worked. I got excited before my first science classes in school, only for me to find that I knew all this physics already.

My first visit there was before I could remember. There is a video of my asking, in that way toddlers do, to be escorted past the gorse and prickles and bees, to the beach so I could play in the sand and the sea. Using the few words that I knew at the time, I succeeded in getting my point across. ""Hand! Hand! Beach!""

The place was sold when I was 12 years old. Out of the 12 people that had a share, only a few wanted to keep it, including my mother. It was sold, and all the wonderful stuff that my grandfather had collected was sold or given away. I got the pool table's scoring board and the stuffed pufferfish.. My parents have a glass buoy.

My parents spent the $50,000 we got from the sale of the house on a trip to and around Europe. That trip was amazing, moving between Paris, Venice, Rome, Athens, and a Greek island called Santorini. I still don't know what I would have preferred. I know I miss that place, and I wouldn't have missed a trip to Europe had it never happened.

My ideal reading place would be there again. If I can ever afford it, and it's on the market, I'll buy it again and live there. If I can do that, and spend the last 10 or so years of my life reading, picking up harpoons and lanterns and buoys from the sea, and living in that house, any other failures or successes of mine will be secondary.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_qriij,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/qriij/ideal_reading_place/,

What are your thoughts on this first round of Writer vs Writer? After running the first round I noticed some things that needed changing. One, send through a message to participants with their prompt once the pairings are assigned. Two, rewrite the rules to clear up questions that were asked. Three, adjust the timespan to be more accomodative of work schedules and people in different time zones who might only discover the prompt well into the 24 hour window. I think 48 hours is more reasonable.

And yet these very same men, who might have cried themselves to sleep over many nights had picked up the pieces, fit them back together and turned themselves into something better - into a great man.

Let's consider this an intro since I don't know any better my own self. 

---- 

**It** is in the fall that he appears, invariably – as he has done so over the centuries. 

When our paths first crossed, I’d asked him: “Who are you?” And he had shook his head and told me that his story was a long and treacherous one. This was back in Halls’, a sleepy fishers’ settlement which lay upon the banks of a river – where men drew nets until their time of calling and the women stayed at home and prayed for those of them who had been sent out into Glory. 

I had told him; then, in the beginning: “Tell me anyway.” 

Elsewhere, further outside the limits, it would be uncommon to see a woman and a man sitting together in a public house like so and drinking from ales and wines – no matter their business at this time of night.... but I am no ordinary woman, and I suspect that he is no ordinary man. He cuts a distinct figure: in his hat which sits crooked at the front, as if a crow is forever staring down the brim of it, and suited in an aristocratic get-up of silk shirt and thick, split coat. And by the Ọ, in such a time (which was not Late-Lore), this would be a Digression upon the both of us. 

“What do you know of Creation?” he’d asked, sniffing from his rot-wine. 

Outdoors, there’d been a holy man, reading from scripture and assorted exegesis to the passing citizens. “Mercy!” he’d claimed. “Mercy upon us!” And pointing up to the sky, he’d cried: “the Ọs’ love and blessings upon us all! Might he!” 

Such words had always made me reflexively cringe – in a tightening of my stomach at the merest of proselytising. “I wonder....” I’d said, trying to keep him away from the topic of religion. “I wonder if maybe there could be a world without the Ọ.” 

“That is blasphemy, you know?” he’d replied. 

I might have been drunk, I now realise – but if I hadn’t said those words, perhaps he would never have told me about himself. It’d been earlier in the evening, and he had just arrived in town, coming into the bordello as if another gentleman caller. He had simply sat there and watched us girls mill about. Some of us had thought he was choosing, but I had known instantly that he wasn’t. He’d simply sat there and scanned us, pausing only to sip from his wine. 

The rest of the clientele had been sitting apart from him. As packed as the ale-floor had been, I could tell that something in him seemed to be driving them away. It was as if he had around him a repugnant aura. Thankfully, because of where he was sitting, he was evenly splitting the more undesirable of the clientele from those who were less so. 

I had –a few months ago- managed to indebt myself to a wealthy businessman, and he had plucked me from my assumed home in the north fields and put me up in his private rooms in this bordello –both to service his own lecherous demands, and- to earn back my freedom by whatever means I had. It was a freedom which any other girl would never have earned, but one which I would – so I’d decided. 

It was one of his boys who approached me that night, drunk and disorderly, grinning at me with his browned teeth, gesturing at me to lead him upstairs. As the authoress of my own fate here, I was to let him have his way with me – hold this favour against my debt to the businessman, but *he* must have noticed the boy not passing coins to me in the view of the presiding Mother (the norm in bordellos at the time was to conduct all business in view of the Mother – it isn’t so any longer). 

So, it was when I was about to lead the boy up the stairs that *he* stood up, face hid in the shadow cast by his crooked hat. I’d done business with the boy some days prior, and knew him to be repulsive; so I must’ve appeared less-than-enthusiastic about the affair – that was likely it. 

At the motion of him, the un-earthliest silence descended upon the ale-floor, and the clientele one-by-one averted their gaze. It was only the boy gesturing at me who didn’t seem to notice him; instead, he continued to try and push me up the stairs, his hands upon me in a vulgar fashion. 

I wouldn’t have wanted him to interfere in my business with the boy, but he intruded upon us regardless. Somehow, as he approached us in slow, deliberate steps, I found my own self transfixed by him. Silent as a spectre, he stalked up to us and stopped behind the boy. And the boy, as if sensing him as he stood there –even through the clog in his mind- turned to face him. “Why, hello.” he grinned. “Would you like to come upstairs with us?” 

He gestured at me. “Would you like an hour with this lady here as well?” he asked. 

“How about we say for the night?” the man said, reaching into his coat and holding out a small coin. It was standard pay – nothing extravagant, as I could plainly see. But in the boy’s eyes, it must’ve been of untold worth. He grabbed it out of the man’s hands, and sputtering and stumbling, he ambled past him and out into the ale-floor – where the clients had returned to their drinking and chatting. 

The man looked at me, his hands in his pockets, and with eyes of pinpoint red; then, with a curt tip of his hat, he smiled and turned back to the floor. 

I’d looked this way and that to see if anyone else was as caught out by his intrusion into my business, but saw no one who had noticed the incident. 

Noticing him exiting the establishment, I collected my coat and hurried out after him – my debt be damned.

DEAD JOE

They had always called him Dead Joe. His friends called him Dead Joe. The people who grew up with him called him Dead Joe. His co-workers called him Dead Joe. His mom called him Joey. His dad called him Joseph, except when he was feeling chummy. Then he called him Dead Joe.

His flatmate from college, Ryan, called him Dead Joe because he had been in a car accident one Christmas while driving home to see his family. Although the accident wasn’t serious (in fact, it was a laughably tame affair in which Joe’s car had glided, at less than 5 miles per hour, into the side of a police cruiser) Ryan had joked that Joe couldn’t have possibly made it out of such carnage alive. Joe’s ex-girlfriend Lori - who had gained several pounds and lost most of her youthful beauty in the ten years since they’d dated in high school, much to Joe’s pleasure - called him Dead Joe because he had become “infuriatingly average” and was “dead inside”. Joe suspected this was more because he had constantly turned her down when she attempted to rekindle their old flame than because he had chosen to grow up, cut his hair, and join society as a productive - if unremarkable - member. Yes. They all called him Dead Joe for one reason or another. Not just to his face, either. 

I had the dubious honor of being the first to call him Dead Joe after he had actually died. 

I found Joe at fifteen-past-three in the morning outside a coffee shop called A Cup of Joy on a rainy Saturday morning in May. He was shivering, confused, nauseated. There was a hole in his neck. His wild eyes darted from sight to nightmarish sight, his mouth agape - a scene typical of the newly dead - as he took in the radical new dimensions the world had opened up to him. I knew what he was seeing - what he saw for the first time this night - the world as it appeared to the dead.

Joe could see the coffee shop in front of him still. Beneath that, in its place he could see the pawn shop it had been in the Eighties, and the curio shop it had been in the Fifties. Under that he could see the lot it had been, and the meadow it had belonged to before that. He could see the tree that had been cut down in the Thirties, and the negro boy who had been hung on one of its stronger branches in 1918. He could see the mob that had strung the boy there, and looking at them he could see their parents, and their grandparents, and their children and grandchildren. He saw them as they lived, as they appeared in every moment of their brief lives, and as they died. He saw the years of decay that had accumulated from their birth, the filth that followed them from that day to this.

Dead Joe retched, slammed his eyes shut and grabbed his head. He tried to scream, beat his fists upon his chest in frustration when no sound came. He tore at his hair, refused to open his eyes. The production of Joe’s lament would have been shocking in its starkness, beautiful in its epic misery, if only its audience was alive. I, however, remained untouched.

“It’s a lot to take in, isn’t it, Dead Joe?” and this name I spoke with contempt because I was not amused by the joke of his name. 

Dead Joe ignored me at first. Typical. Selfish. 

“Do you plan to stay here, then? Crying? Frightened as a stupid corpse?” I continued. “Not that it matters to me. I have other... commitments that I could see to instead.”

Still Dead Joe ignored me, crouched on the sidewalk, his back to me, his body shaking in despair, his head tucked into his chest. I approached him from behind, knelt by his miserable form and whispered into his dead ears. “Not that it matters much, not anymore. You picked a bad time to die, Joe. You picked a real bad time. Worthless corpse. You missed Heaven by this much.”

He turned his head to face me, pouting angrily. I had his attention. 

“Oh. Heaven is it?” I asked him. “Is that what you hoped would come next, Dead Joe? A Chariot adorned in azure flame to carry you to the Good Kingdom? An audience with The Most High? Terribly sorry to disappoint,” although I wasn’t. “No, all that us corpses have here is the world we’ve made. The world as its been and as it is today. And you, you careful idiot, you’ll miss out on that as well, I’m afraid.”

Dead Joe had stopped shaking and was now staring at me. His hand absent-mindedly traced the vulgar cut drawn upon his neck. He couldn’t talk if he’d wanted to, not with that hole in his throat. His silence almost made me like him. Almost, that is, until he began to learn how to communicate.

“Ker-iss-ta-ta-tahb-” It was a sharp sound, a desperate thought.

“Now, Joe. That isn’t very polite, is it? Blurting out nonsensical thoughts. One might exercise some self-control.”

“Ker-isss. K-kerissta - Keh”

“Well, don’t choke on the thought, Dead Joe, you haven’t swallowed a rat. Think in civilized words, if you must think at all.”

“Krista. Kristie. Kris. Kristabel. Krista. Kristie...”

“Yes?”

“Kristabel? Kristabel?”

“Your mate? Afraid she survived the incident Joe. Its just you and I, isn’t it? It pains me to tell you, Joe,” although I took precious joy in telling him, “your woman wore her restraining belt and you, you poor idiot, were flung through a windshield like a bag of rice. Oh it was horrible! She screamed Joe! She was so frightened. She’s still frightened. And alone. And you are here with me” I smiled. 

“Kristabel.” pathetic. Despairing. Had he been speaking like the living his voice would have broke and the word trailed off. Instead the thought cut off abruptly as if it were a recording.

“Alive. Very much unlike you.”

“A ghost? Spirit?”

I scoffed at him and replied with derision “A ghost, Dead Joe? Hardly. Such an obscene word is beneath us. It’s a word created by a people that will never understand our kind, and it is an insult. You’d do well to remember that, at least for the short time that remains before none of this matters.”

“Matters?”

“Yes, Joe. As I’ve told you, you chose a horrible time to die. You’ll see only the end of a dynasty whose magnificence you won’t have time to comprehend. You’ve arrived at the theatre a bit late, I’m afraid, and the story itself will make no sense. In short time, Joe, none of this will matter. Our world is changing. You’ve missed it. There’s a storm coming, Dead Joe. The bodies of the dead will soon rise...""

“Z-zombies...?”

I laughed. “You and your words. Zombies. It’s dirt in my mouth.” I made a gesture of spitting on the ground. “The bodies of the dead will rise, Joe, and that will be the end of our world. If you insist on feeling melancholy, Joe, don’t mourn your death. No. There are greater things to mourn now. Look around you, Joe - ” (he didn’t) “ - look at our paradise. You won’t unlock the secrets of this world because you haven’t the time. This world will be gone before your maggot-brain even begins unravelling its mystery. Look at that phantom tree-” (he did) “-look at all you can see there. It takes centuries to understand the millions of layers buried in that one spot. Answers, Dead Joe! Answers to every question you’ve ever asked, buried in our world like precious baubles, begging, begging to be discovered. You won’t get that opportunity though, will you? Because Dead Joe died too late!” I spat.

“Why - why?” he pleaded.

“Because the bodies of the dead will rise. Even your body, your stupid, fractured, ridiculous puppet of a corpse will saunter around this world like a plague. These abominations will poison every trace of life that this world remembers. All of these layers will be painted over with the dull grey of undead. All the answers I’ve spent centuries learning - well, you won't get your answers. They’ll be gone before it even occurs to you to look for them.”

I could see that Dead Joe was still confused. “Look at that coffee shop. Look beneath it. You see that colored boy hanging dead from that tree? You can see his whole life. You can see him from the day he was born to the day his neck broke in that noose.” and still, though the concept seemed so elementary to me, Dead Joe hadn’t grasped the meaning. I spoke to him slowly, as one speaks to a child or a fool: “From the day he was born - to the day he died. His life left this... echo, you might say, an echo that shadowed his life with each reverberation.” Still, Joe was infuriatingly vacant. “What do you think will happen when that child’s body walks again? It will add infinite data to every iteration of his memory. The secrets hidden there will be buried under mountains of nothing. That mob that sentenced him - their bodies will stir as well. The woman watching from her window, the mother weeping down the street. The world of the living will be invaded by the children of the past, and this invasion will abolish the histories written here.”

“We who have wandered this expanse for centuries have done our research. Every question that occurred to us had an answer waiting to be found in the souls of those who have died. All that was required of us was the patience to search for those answers. We are aware of the world in all of its staggering dimensions because we have spent centuries researching. We have become elevated - that is to say we have evolved into superior beings through these pursuits. I have all the answers I will ever need, Joe. I have every knowledge I’d ever hoped for.”

“You will have nothing. In the time before this vast body of knowledge dries up you cannot hope to gain even an infinitesimal fraction of the truths we know.”

“Why are you telling me this?” His thoughts sounded angry, annoyed.

“Oh, I don’t know. Perhaps because there’s some sport in it for me. Maybe I’m happy to be the one to welcome you to your meaningless eternity, to show you that if you’d lived your life more recklessly, perhaps you would have been blessed with this journey earlier. Maybe you’d have time to learn even the most basic of our secrets, to begin to fathom our complex existences. Maybe then you’d be useful. Maybe it brings me joy to tell you - Dead Joe - Honestly-Literally-Truly-Dead Joe - that you have nothing to offer our community of what you would absurdly refer to as ‘ghosts’. And the walking dead - the zombies, as you say... Well, I suppose you’re the zombie here: Lifeless, purposeless, shambling stupidly, awkwardly into our world. We have no use for parasites here.”

I put my hand on his shoulder, stared hard into his moronic face, into his dull eyes. “Dead Joe, I’m afraid you are not welcome here,” I smiled as the words penetrated. Joe began to weep. He grabbed my arms, begging, pleading, blubbering silently with his torn throat and dead frown. I stood then, shaking him off of me as one does a pest. Joe wrapped his arms around my leg and looked up into my terrible eyes until, seeing no compassion there, he fell away. 

“You’ve very little time, parasite. One might suggest you begin learning all you can about this world before it’s written away.” and with these words I left him, Dead Joe, staring into the histories of the world trying desperately to understand the truths buried there. Lucky fool. Dead Joe would never reach the end of knowledge, as we had. He would never find all the answers, only to learn there weren’t that many to begin with, not when one has centuries to search. He would never discover how hopelessly mundane the world was. I hated him for his fortune, his undeserved good luck. 

...and as I thought of the injustice of lucky Dead Joe’s death, I wept.

**CHAPTER ONE | STANCE**
**NIGHT, STARRY NIGHT** 

The clouds stretch to as far as the eye can see tonight. Blotting out stars and moons for the first time since the last rains, they stretch to the ominous dark of horizon, where the storm-clouds knot in threatening fashion. And beneath this darkness, the city of Artifice is lit by gaslight – defiant in the face of yet another months-long blackout. 

Groups of Believers are out on the streets already: playing harbingers to the crowd; while troupes of Weathermen scurry to and fro: outfitting buildings for rain. Businesses run quicker than usual under the threat of rain: airships float in and out of the docks in swarms of a dozen at a time, their fires burning dim in the distance from where he watches; a few streets closer.... stockists’ peddle the last of their spices and liquors at cut-prices and in frantic voices to the more daring of the merchants – while the less-daring scurry out to the dockyards to catch the last ferries across the Isles; and in midst of all this quickness – there are the wealthy, shivering foreigners snapping plates of the brash Artificial skyline from atop the transports that creep up the Thistle, setting off little spits of magnesium-light over the tumultuous waters. 

And in spite of this fog –in the thick of this mass emigration- the great Clock-Tower counts the minutes down to the first of the rains. 

~~additional line break~~

In his business, the business of Intelligentsia, however: business runs as ever – with clockwork precision. 

Presently idling, he watches her ghost extinguish the gaslights of her private balcony – moving between them one after the other and blowing them smoky out into the night air. And even in the darkness and without the comfort of eyes like hers’, he’s certain that she notices him watching her. But she doesn’t make anything of it. 

She’s born of privilege – doctored (once, long ago) into possessing those sharp eyes that catch even the littlest light out from the darkness. Himself – he’s not so unfortunate, but in the face of her advantage during these voyeuristic nocturnal episodes, he has learnt to make up for his shortcomings in other ways. 

When she’s finished with the lanterns, she lingers on her balcony awhile, looking out to the narrow collection of market-streets, where the city-lights are burning their season-brightest tonight – ignoring him with terrible purpose. 

In the distance, past the Clock-Tower and the dockyards and over the great ocean, of course the storm clouds are still brewing, looming dark and thick against the darkness of the Artificial night. They are approaching ever-slower at this time of year – as if teasing all the citizens of Artifice with hope against their terrible rains. 

There was a travelling merchant’s daughter he once knew –whose family had been stranded in Artifice over the monsoons some years ago-, who’d looked to the Clock-Tower in wonderment –through the thick goggles she’d bought from the monsoon-time markets- that one time when he’d taken her to Arches’ Foot. Given to juvenile attempts at poetry, she’d likened the clouds to spited demons, and the Clock-Tower to a mythical warrior, both of whom were fated to be forever locked in that eternal struggle of archetypes: person vs. nature – an apt analogue from those more innocent times, and surely apt to the uncultured mind; but that wasn’t what he, nor his familiars –who numbered among the more cultured citizens of Artifice- saw in their most singular icon. Instead of a legendary warrior braving spirits and demons, the analogue they ascribed to the two legendary figures were that of ingenuity versus tribulation. 

“Who do you think built the Clock-Tower?” she’d asked, when they were on their way back to the Underground from the Foot. “Do you think it’s always been there?” 

He’d shrugged, and that was where they’d left it.

Could you see this character in a longer story or novel?)",George_Benson,8,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1jk2a6/feedback_gas_station_aviators_892_words_character/,"Michael wore aviators that he bought at a gas station. Scratched off the label and told everyone that they were custom built by some Italian guy. But after a Google search of Luigi Vespucci didn't yield an Italian eyewear crafter who specializes in American design, they called bullshit. So Michael called them uncultured.

Michael wore Tommy Hilfiger shirts and shorts with his sun-kissed Sperry's. He had yellow, red, purple, and green ones, seersucker, striped, solid, and dotted ones. He thought they made him look devil-may-care. They made him look snobbish. When there wasn't any sun, he hung his sunglasses off the top button of his shirt to flaunt true Italian craftsmanship.

Michael gelled his hair in a supposedly sensual way. On his chin, the goatee that he had been nurturing for over a month (but which he wasn't old enough to grow) struggled to survive. The wispy hairs swayed lazily with every condescending shake of his head. To his face, people complimented his mature appearance. Behind his back, they giggled mercilessly.

But Michael was proud of that emaciated patch of hair. You have to be proud of everything you accomplish when you don't accomplish much.

Unfortunately, Michael was unbearably proud. One time in grade school, he won Student of the Week. Everyone did, a fact that Michael refused to recognize. His teacher bought him a Dollar Tree medal with a frayed ribbon that read ""You're #1!"" Joy seizing his fingers, he tried to humbly adorn the honor but ended up beaming like the jack-ass he was. In the dull plastic, Michael saw a movie star loved by millions for his philanthropy, a rock legend who cured cancer, and a rocket scientist selling a million copies of his latest fantasy epic, all of which would be child's play for a man of his infinite potential. Right up to the day he moved out, Michael subtly hinted at his worthless trophy to any newcomer in his room until they had to notice it. He never won anything again.

Lack of material didn't stem Michael's bragging. Strutting across the freshly clipped lawns of his private high school, the sunlight glinting off his golden rings, he extolled his sleek new BMW, his sprawling mansion, and (the one time his parents refused to spoil him) even his shitty sunglasses. While his perfectly manicured fingernails tapped lazily against the delicate hairs of his chin, he complimented his own beautifully lush hair, his tasteful outfit, and the masculinity of his beard. One time he exercised; he bragged about how fit he was for a week. He boasted of his humility, intelligence, and creativity, asserting that the only reason he received subpar grades was he didn't give a fuck. Whenever he managed to muster a crowd, he nonchalantly told lavish, made-up tales of drunken glory, pussy attainment, and other forms of badassery.

And as part of building himself up, Michael tore others down. His tone refining into a sharp, sardonic edge, he mocked their modest homes, scuffed cars, and ""gas station"" aviators. Many times during lunch, he spilled milk on another's shirt and told them not to get upset since it probably wasn't worth much anyway. He criticized the nerds for trying too hard, the jocks for being idiots, and the poor for being lazy (like most rich kids, he felt he deserved his wealth). It was pitiful.

Aside from his reflection, Michael had few friends. Women avoided him like the plague, only touching him with brief glances of disgust. He spent every weekend alone, socializing vicariously through Facebook. Wherever he sat at lunch, others left. Whenever he asked about the upcoming party, everyone silenced. When people did bother listening to him, it was with a slight, mocking smile on their lips.

Michael got the picture. He knew no one could stand him. So, lost and cripplingly uncharismatic, he decided that the only way he could garner friends would be to garner respect. 

But Michael did it all wrong. Since people must know what you've accomplish in order to respect you, he bragged. By exposing others' flaws, he validated his own superiority. And dressing himself in the finest clothes and sporting facial hair gave him a mature, respectable look. Or so he thought.

And what started out as subtle actions designed to win the approval of his peers led to mocking. So Michael upped the ante, but that led to more mocking. And this cycle continued until Michael became just an inescapable parody of himself.

By high school, Michael hated everyone else. Hated that they could be themselves. Hated that they all had girlfriends to share their burdens. Fiery tears burning in his eyes, he watched them laugh together, cry together, and poke fun at each other while he stood alone with only a nice care and a nice house and too much money. He pined to join them instead of being this self-absorbed asshole, but they would claim it was just another ruse to prove his superiority. Be it rational or irrational, Michael saw the only way forward as digging himself deeper into the grave he had begun in grade school.

So Michael wore aviators that he bought at a gas station. Scratched off the label and told everyone that they were custom built by some Italian guy. Because no one respects a man who wears gas station aviators.

--------------------------------------
She was pushed out onto the street.

Octavia closed her eyes. The taste of salt entered her lips. Her face looked like the rain on the window that she had looked out of only seconds ago. Before he violently pulled her off of the chair and threw her out.

She pushed herself up now though. Her arms shook as she did and she tried to look up at her husband when she got up to her knees. When she went to speak her voice was gone and she gasped for air between her cries. Hyperventilating she managed to croak, “Wa-w-why? What  did I do to-,”

Then her child was thrown towards her. Her heart skipped a beat as she flung herself out to catch her child midair. A groan left her when her back hit the stone of the back alley. A crack was heard from her back. Pain was nothing however in a situation like this, soon her arms cradled her daughter tightly and she kissed her forehead. Her hand brushed through Lians hair as she whispered,

“Hush child, hush, don’t cry, Mommy has you. Yes. Mommy has you,” she said a second time to reassure herself more than anyone else.

Octavia then looked up to where her child was thrown from. Everything was blurry though and she took a second to wipe her tears away. Lian had been crying all the while as she waved her hands around frantically until she found her Mother's neck. Octavia could only stare at her husband though. He was standing in the door-frame with each fist balled up. 

Nothing made any sense to her. How had the times changed so quickly? She could still recall when they had met in the temple. The gut-wrenching feeling that she had followed by the heat rising to her cheeks when she looked away, trying not to be caught staring. Bishop Marin, at the time he appeared young, confident, and handsome. How powerful Marin was with his influence over the temple. Now she only saw Widower Marin. No longer  was he clothed in bishop garments but instead a linen shirt with holes and pants torn down the side. The alcohol could even be smelt a foot away. Octavia still didn’t know the full story behind his excommunication. She use to be shy to look at him out of embarrassment now though she was shy to look at him out of fear. Her right eye still stung from yesterday. 

“I don’t understand. I don’t. I can’t. Why?  Why are you doing this to me?” She cried turning her back to Marin and placing her child behind her. She didn’t know what broke her heart more. The fact her marriage was over or the fact her child's life would be ruined. Octavia couldn’t recall any single parents she had met who raised a well-behaved kid. It was impossible to maintain enough money to raise the child and also be in their life.

“I can’t take you anymore Octavia,” he yelled and took a step forth, “You bother me all day! Its not my fault I was excommunicated from the Temple! I had no hand to play in the downfall of the economy. How can you still blame me for not finding work when nobody we know can? We have no bread and sure as shit the landlord is going to evict us. What the hell am I suppose to do?”

She wanted to remind him of how they’d be able to pay the landlord and make sure Lian wasn’t hungry if he didn’t spend every ducat on liquor. Even if she dared she’d only get a word out for his hand lunged at her. His fingers clenched around her throat and they stared at each other in silence as she sniffled. Then she heard Lian shriek and both her and Octavia screamed at the same time, “No!” Lian to her father to not choke her Mother and her Mother to Lian to not anger her husband. Smack. Lian hit the floor and Octavia was thrown down beside her. 

Behind a pile of garbage a rat had witnessed this entire scene. When she saw the woman hit the ground he couldn’t make out the difference between the sound of the door closing and Octavias body hitting the ground. They happened at the same time.

1375379591.0,3,self.KeepWriting,1jiasy,"Blind Addiction. My first narrative, 1600 words.",ballerberry,7,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1jiasy/blind_addiction_my_first_narrative_1600_words/,"This is my first narrative. Wondering if I have to ability to do this as more than just a hobby. Be as critical as you like! Would love to hear your thoughts. Also does anyone know what to call this piece? I could only think of the word narrative. 

Blind Addiction

I know what you’re thinking. I’d never get addicted to that stuff. I have self-control, I’m a smart person, and I know better. But all my friends are doing it, so maybe I’ll try it. Just this once.
You naïve idiot.

Don’t you think I thought the same thing? That’s always how it starts. Next thing you know you’re labeled a “junkie” by your family and best friends. Sometimes it takes years to end up there, sometimes only months. For the unlucky few to be busted by the law, ironically called the justice system: all your life accomplishments can be rescinded instantaneously. That unsuspecting college student can get thrown in prison with no hopes of a decent future education or job description. Alakazam! A junkie in the flesh. I would know. 

Indulgence happens to the best of us and we have to accept the consequences.

Take it from an addict in recovery. Addiction isn’t what you’d expect it to be. Most addicts don’t realize they’re addicted even after it’s really obvious. Their polluted minds convince themselves they’re “fine” and they can “quit any time they want.” Isn’t it funny how we justify our actions to ourselves? I used to be great at that. But I’m off my high horse now. I thought I was such hot shit. 

Wasn’t I?

Let me guess. You think you’re above addiction, don’t you? Of course you do. Haven’t you been listening? Everybody does. How does it feel to know that when asked about drug use or abuse, your response is the same as an addict’s? Makes you wonder. At least, it should...

It’s a vicious cycle. You can start off smoking weed once a week, but then you feel a craving for something more and you start drinking once a week too. The legal drugs are the worst because they’re so much easier to justify. Don’t even get me started on cigarettes and those god damned anti-depressants that half of US use every day. And you have the nerve to say my psychology is out of whack! 

Eventually you’re drinking and smoking every other day to counteract the aftereffects of the previous intoxication, chasing your high and all the while ignoring the signs that maybe this is a habit you cannot control. Are you an addict now? Maybe. Maybe not. Who am I to say where addiction begins? My opinions don’t even matter to society anymore, and they certainly never mattered to you. 

Getting arrested for shooting heroin doesn’t bode well for a guy’s integrity. I learned that the hard way.
Don’t get me wrong, though. I don’t blame drugs for my dissent. God, no! These were my choices, my decisions, my life. My “faults” and “crimes,” according to the government.

I truly believed I was invincible then. I was the perfect student on the path to success and I’d be damned if some high school dropout police officer was going to tell me how to spend my free time. And was I ever damned.
 
It wasn’t always this way. I used to be sheltered and naïve and judgmental and sober. Once I made the decision to try drugs for the first time, every following decision to try more or try another was twice as easy. It kept getting easier, too, until I had completely forgotten that my victimless crime was illegal. My fear of authority became nonexistent.  I carried some with me at all times, and the word “heroin” triggered about the same emotional response for me as the word “water” might for you.

All my friends did it. We bonded over it. We were finding ourselves, learning, and taking great pleasure in our discoveries. It was a pure fascination of something we could not understand. We didn’t realize the damage we were doing until it was far too late. 
We couldn’t understand why what we were doing was wrong. We weren’t hurting anybody or stealing anything. We were just doing drugs!

It’s easy to hide it, you know. Encouraged, even. Ever notice how our prescriptions are supposed to be secret? The daily Adderall or Xanax script is personal information to be shared at your own risk. The pharmacologists are making billions every year and we’re supposed to pretend like everyone functions perfectly sober and normal at all hours. 

Well I call bullshit. Just because we don’t talk about watching porn doesn’t mean we aren’t all doing it. Seriously, don’t try to deny any of it. Moms are smoking in the bathroom, kids on the roof, and dads while nobody’s home. I’ve seen it all. Nobody has to know you’re an addict. It’s not always so obvious and dramatic like it is in the movies. There are plenty of fully functional contributing members of society who also happen to be addicted to a substance. In fact, you’re probably one of them. 

Does our justice system not have better things to do than arrest me and wreck my life because I like to get high? This is your money at work. Taxes paid for my arrest and in exchange your kids have to share a desk at school. Where are our priorities? What is the greater evil? Sorry to challenge your unoriginally-stereotyped perception, but oh my god just think for yourself for once! Is this really what you think or is this just what you were told to think? 

You’ve heard it a million times: drugs are bad, you’ll get addicted, just say no, stay above the influence. What a fountain of garbage you are! I bet you do everything you're told to do. You’ve already made up your mind. You look down on those losers you see in the movies, completely unaware that one day you will soon be just like them.

So start with the justifications, explanations and clarifications. Start down that path of self-destruction and desperation. Go ahead. You’ll probably learn something about yourself -- about the world. *Spoiler alert* Everybody is equal here, you fucking bastard. Do you understand me?! I know you think you’re better than me – than I am – but in my situation you would have done – will do – the exact same thing. You’re only human too, you know. If I was in your place...

So don’t pretend like you know me, because you don’t have a fucking clue. You don’t know shit about me and choices I’ve made or the work I’ve done but I’ve accomplished more than you could dream of. I know you far too well. I was you, once. 

Success, wealth, power, authority. It can all be lost in the blink of an eye.

I used to attend Harvard University a couple years back. Shocking I know. I probably could have started with that, but that’s hardly what my story is about. My point is, I am educated. Just like you and perhaps even more so. If you don’t believe me, go ask professor Addington about his favorite student. He’ll tell you all about me. If that’s not enough, refer to my impeccable grammar and extravagant vocabulary. Impressive, isn't it? Are my warnings credible now? Are you really still in denial? You have a hundred problems in front of you but you can't fix any of them because you refuse to take the first step.

They don’t tell you it happens in college, but it does. Especially in the Ivies. The subjectively smart, selectively and semi-randomly chosen, rich kids all thrown into close quarters probably find drugs faster than anyone else ever could. Doesn’t take long before they get bored and figure out a way to get what they want. Smart people always seem to find a way to get what they want. 

Greedy assholes. Why can’t you be happy with what you have?

I don’t expect to be able to help you. At a certain point it becomes impossible. The spiral keeps moving in a downward direction and outside intervention isn’t always enough to stop it from crashing straight into the ground. Denial is a powerful trick indeed.

I guess I’m just writing this so that you’ll realize when you’re going through what I am that I was right. Fuck you and the way you judge me with those hateful, confident eyes. This is just to say I told you so. I can hardly wait until it gets you too. You’ve got to admit the hilarity in the situation. I’m warning you right now and you’re too stupid to realize you’re already on the infamous downward spiral with an economy class seat, sitting only a few rows behind yours truly. I ride first class.

The thought of it almost makes me want to live. Almost.

So go ahead. Try it. Try it now, you son of a bitch. I dare you to do it. But don’t try to tell me it’s just this once. You can say it all you want, but just know you’re saying it for you, not for me. I already know the truth. I invented the truth for Chris’sake. And you’ll come back for more. 

Did you know that if you introduced a mouse to nicotine and then forced it to choose between the nicotine and food, it will pick the drug every time? It’s true. Their feeble minds ignore their most basic instinct of hunger in order to feed their addiction. You think you’re hungry when the restaurant takes half an hour to serve your food? Give me a break you spoiled brat. Even the starving people in Africa don’t know what true hunger is.
I have a syringe and some fresh heroin all set up and ready to go. Haven’t had any in 22 hours and I’m ready for more. I got a lot this time. It’s supposed to be bomb. 

This is the last time, I promise. 

I guess if I overdose they’ll call this my suicide letter. Hard to believe I still care what they think of me. What you think of me. I went to Harvard, god damn it!

I’ve never tried this much before. I’m a little nervous, but mostly excited. I suppose I am procrastinating. Maybe I don’t want to die after all, but if I do, well, at least it’ll end on a high note. I’ll spend my final moments laughing at you for being too high in the clouds to realize I’m talking directly to you right now. I was never too fond of living anyways. And it’s got to be done. The heroin isn’t going to inject itself, you know.

Wish me luck.

Not only the bottoms of the dark clouds that mass overhead, but also the ground, my hands, the hands of my captors. My face feels wet, but they won't let me wipe it.

I hear they've found me barely conscious by the front door of the Tower of Truth, their mocking voices amused by my attempt to escape leaving such a conspicuous trail. Empty insults. Wind.

Our cloaks billow wildly as I'm dragged across the square in front of the Palace towards a short pillar of stone surrounded by gore.

How predictable. But yes, a public beheading would suit them.

I'd expected to feel dizzier, but maybe it's the imminence of death that keeps me alert. I'll be part of this fake display of justice, and I'll watch it up to the last moment.

Things seem different today, however.

I notice the crowd isn't staring at me, the main attraction, which gives me a shred of hope. Despite knowing I'll never find out what they'll make of my message, it's comforting to see they aren't cheering. I wish to believe it hasn't been in vain, that it's meant something.

Will they be able to do what they must?

One way or another, at least true justice has found me. At last.

The world spins when a hard blow sends me to my knees. Iron manacles secure my wrists to the stone, leather straps hold me bent over the dried blood of those who came and went before me.

My heart sinks when I see the executioner's face. The Hand has tears in his eyes.

As my best friend raises the sword above his head, the ground starts trembling under the feet of thousands running towards him. Their roar fills the air.

Red becomes black.

This is all true, despite what the official Army intelligence record would have you believe. Every word of it. Sure, the helicopter crash happened, but there sure wasn’t any outbreak or botched military training exercise. There was a tragedy happened, just not the one that the media reported.

Seeing people off had been the neighborly thing to do, at least that’s how it started. Sometime after the Johnsons left, or maybe the Richardsons, it became a full blown ritual. A gathering, not to say goodbye to our friends and wish them well, but to mourn our own decaying futures. Each occasion was quieter and more sparse than the last. Life had become a game of musical chairs, the music had stopped, and none of the damn chairs were in Rivet Springs. 

Believe it or not, Rivet Springs had once been a thriving American industrial town, back when there ever was such a thing. The backbone of the American economy they called us. We had a chemical plant and a steel mill and a machine shop that produced, well, rivets. We weren’t founded on creativity, just good old fashioned hard work. The downsizing happened slower than we could notice, until one day we woke up to find our primary export was our neighbors. Now the industrial complex lay rotten and abandoned, taunting us with it’s toothless smile of intermittently shattered windows. The great oxidized skeleton of prosperity itself.

This is what we thought about that day. 

A collective sigh decompressed as we all stood idly about waiting for someone to do something. No one did. The productive had abandoned the town months ago to go do productive things someplace else. 

Time staggered the way it always does in moments of aimless waiting.

“Wish it was mine,” whispered someone. It was the collective sentiment of the group made audible. 

Then a quiet tugging at a mother’s hand pushed the first domino. The tension was broken by the honest simplicity of a child, and everyone sauntered silently homeward.

A town meeting was called the following day and, having nothing else to do, everyone was in attendance. It was held in the old church hall. The folding chairs were still lined up from the AA meeting the week prior. Even Crazy Mister Marty managed to show up, despite not being formally invited. Or even told that there was any such meeting in the first place.

Marty was his first name and not even the town register knew his last. He had no official documentation to speak of. Paid no taxes and owned no land. Took no handouts. The title of “Mister” was granted out of respect for his age, suppose for the sake of instilling some couth into the children. The “Crazy” came from the fact that he lived in the woods and he shit in a hole. There was word that he used to be a chemical engineer at the old facility during Vietnam, but that explained nothing about him save for his occasionally surprising vocabulary.

The general mood of the meeting was a bit more tense than usual. 

“Now, everybody calm down. It’s going to be all right. We just need to put our heads together and figure something out, is all.” said Avery Jacobson, tugging at his pants pockets and shifting his weight from one foot to the other. He stood at the microphone in place of Mayor Williams. The good mayor was pursuing a middle management position somewhere outside of Pittsburgh. So much for the captain going down with his ship.

“Now what we all spose’d to do?” ejaculated Greg Jones. “Sit ‘round and wait for the bank to foreclose our houses? Bank Murika don’t even want our land.”

“Greg, it’s not so bad as all that,” Jacobson coughed into the microphone. “Nobody is going to come and take our homes.”

“That’s the damn problem!” Jones shouted back. He stood and heaved his folding chair at the podium. Jacobson ducked behind it for protection as the chair struck and fell, collapsing into a heap on the floor.

“Calm down, now, Greg. You’re, you know, scaring the children.”

“They ought’a be scared! They can’t even get a proper education in this hole. Look at Spencer over there, he’s a damn imbecile.” He pointed at the schoolteacher.

“Hey. HEY!... I.. I.. Look, I.. I’m the most qualified here. Stop being a j-j-jerk. We’re all worried about the future” Spencer responded. He had reason to be worried-- it was true-- he’d never find another job in his life. The man wasn’t state certified to paper train a dog.

Suddenly, a voice shook the room.

“THIS IS YOUR RECKONING!” Crazy Mister Marty shouted from the back row. He rose to his feet, holding a half-eaten squirrell. The rodent had been skinned and roasted, mostly, save for its bushy tail. “This been a long time coming. The Lizard Man prophesied it-- that your weakness and your indecision would be your undoing, visited down upon your children.”

He began patrolling the aisles, waving the squirrell wildly as he sermonized. 

“He’s been watching you, judging your inability to stand up for yourselves and take what’s yours. To do something meaningful with your opportunities. Instead, you been scattering like roaches or waiting around for the gov’ment to pass through on its white horse, leaving a trail of cash and rainbows. You’ll get no bailout. You brought this on yourselves. You sat by and watched your town wither and die.”

We townsfolk shifted in our chairs. 

“And YOU!” He pointed the squirrell at Jones, still standing. “Throwing around angry words and furniture. Demanding of others the prosperity you’re too stupid to build by your own power. You’re nothing but a blithering parasite.”

Jones lowered himself cautiously into the nearest chair, never breaking eye contact.

“The Lizard Man cometh. He’ll have this town when the last of you finally runs off, tail between your legs.”

He backed up, taking calculated steps toward the door.

“But run away as you may, you won’t find some happy reception someplace else,” He said, biting off a chunk of meat and spitting it on the floor. 

“Failure is the shadow of the weak.”

And with those words, Crazy Mister Marty disappeared from the hall.

Pilgrims of fate, they wondered aimlessly through the dried lava of the old world. They were walking epitaphs to the ragged memory of humanity, and Roderick their prophet. If they were to fall where they stood, the sand would cover them in less than three days. They would be gone, swallowed. Their memory no more real that the roads and grass that had grew above them. They followed a trail through the stones, undisturbed by the wind for the inclines that lined it. There were no landmarks, the camp behind them was now a mirage on the phosphorescent waves. Kurt sipped from an old army canteen, periodically looking behind them and checking for tracks. Stanley held a compass, binoculars hung crudely from his neck. The inaugural explorer of Hell. 
	It wasn't long before they came to a shack in the middle of the wastes. Emptied and gutted by passing marauders, the door was laying some metres away and the glass in the windows was shattered. An old picket fence limply guarded the perimetre, the wood stained with blood and residue of the scum carried by the air. The old tufts of cracked grass stained the base of the posts with the impressions of an old hedgerow burned into the panelling. Kurt sat leaning against the fence, his chest rising and falling in the midday heat. He was wiping his brow and his shirt was stained with sweat. 
""I'll check round the back. Go in and make sure nothing has been left inside"" Roderick commanded them, and they entered the house. 
Roderick traced the exterior of the house with his fingers, several splinters burrowed into the fleshy tips but he didn't feel them. The texture of the wood was soothing. He turned the corner and climbed the fence into the garden and stopped in the centre, staring at the twisted boughs of a tree at the end. A man hung from the branch closest to the ground. Wolves had been, his feet were missing. His face was swollen and demonic and contorted with agony. He swayed loosely in the breeze, animating his body in a haunting rhythm. 
""A bullet would have been quicker"", Roderick muttered. 
	He looked behind him and saw Stanley looking out into the garden from the hollowed wall into the kitchen. He had seen it before, but he still looked a man broken. The garden was bare and dead, the lone wind breathed final draughts between the branches and carried the scent of the death with it toward the horizon.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1j7jt9,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1j7jt9/feedback_post_apocalyptic_series_of_shorts/,

Very rough draft,tez205,6,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1j70ht/feedback_2nd_chapter_of_a_untitled_fantasy_pirate/,"As the title states, its the second chapter. The goal of this chapter was to give a identity to the Quartermaster character and the initial battle scene. I wrote this between 12am and 4am, I know the grammar is probably bad and if you see any inconsistencies please point them out to me. 

I feel that I should give the back story on the Black Bonnie character that isn't explained in this chapter but was explained in the previous chapter. She wears a mask similar to a carnival mask that covers her hold face, called ""the King's Gift."" I'm still trying to come up with a good reason of why she's wearing it, but hopefully that explains the end of second chapter.  In the first chapter, they spot a ship that seemed to be carrying a heavy cargo and the pirates all vote to give chase and raid. 

Enough rambling, Here you go:

The thrill of the forbidden, the anxiety mingled with the hope that the world remains ignorant of what I'm doing.

This must have been the feeling sought after by those citizens who had their eyes removed last week. Much as it confuses me, I find it to be quite intoxicating.

Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s been keeping me from throwing up. Am I that twisted? Something in my training must have made me able to react like this.

Cue the Blind Mistress, who can actually see quite well. All Hands are guilty of feeling smug for knowing that little fact, myself included. Nor is she of mythical beauty. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be flayed for mistaking her for a peasant if I somehow found her on the streets without that ceremonial garb. Less wrinkled here than nowadays, perhaps, that she is.

The face of Harmony paces in front of her four Powers, a charming smile on her lips in spite of something entirely different in her eyes. I can&amp;rsquo;t identify it, though I can tell the face of Justice glows with the same light.

Innocence is what I see on the others. Mercy, Humility &amp;mdash; that suits them. Reason, not so much, which I find a tad unsettling. I feel an urge to yell at the screen, to alert him to what the Mistress and her Justice have been scheming for the past four tapes. I press a hand to my mouth lest I do just that.

A sudden flash of steel, a chair knocked over. The sound nearly sends my heart flying from my throat, but I&amp;rsquo;m still alone in the dark room. When they lunge, I cry.

Running headlong into the open yard and becoming a sitting duck, that was even easier.

Easier for them, I mean.

A small but very loud explosion sends me scrambling to take cover in the colonnade, in front of a door. Will it open?

I take a deep breath and try my luck, but it&amp;rsquo;s locked. Maybe the next&amp;mdash;

Three more shots pin me again, but all of them fly wide. Are they missing on purpose?

&amp;ldquo;Surrender now!&amp;rdquo; The voice comes from some window above me, his tone at odds with his words. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re wanted alive, but we&amp;rsquo;re clear to put you down if we have to! Don&amp;rsquo;t tempt us!&amp;rdquo; Now he&amp;rsquo;s being honest.

&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll spare me now so I can die later?&amp;rdquo; This isn&amp;rsquo;t a game, for harmony&amp;rsquo;s sake.

I reckon these pillars won&amp;rsquo;t save me forever, so I bolt for the next door. They land a bullet no farther than a span from my head.

&amp;ldquo;Final warning! Forsake your lies now!&amp;rdquo;

How dare they&amp;mdash;

If that was meant to give me pause, they almost had me. But as a Hand I know there's no such thing as sparing a surrenderer, so I keep zigzagging between columns and doors. The next three are all locked &amp;mdash; curses!

&amp;ldquo;Whoever ordered you to murder me is the real liar!&amp;rdquo; The truth echoes from the square, but at this distance the words are unintelligible. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;d do the same if you&amp;rsquo;d seen what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen!&amp;rdquo;

The dozen clicks I hear above me mean parley&amp;rsquo;s over. Automatic fire.

Looking around the yard, I spot a double door ajar and no other options. Excellent. What&amp;rsquo;s good about having no choice is not having to think much. You just gamble.

I race for it, right into their trap.

**Marefjellet**

A courteous wind twirled around the man’s feet as he stepped out of his vehicle. A tall, lanky figure of age no more than thirty, though his face told a different tale. His hair was short, but in complete disarray, a near perfect match for the thin, chaotic beard that covered most of his pale visage. A twice broken nose was his only visible feature along with his eyes, wide open with a long faded hue of green, yet observant to the point of blurred obsession.  They shot up towards the skyline. The dark, towering mountain gazed back down on him as if to mock him. It was drenched in weak, fleeting mists all the way down to the forest in front of him. A nervous laugh escaped his mouth as he rifled through his car for anything of use: a woodcarver’s knife, a bottle of caffeine pills and a half eaten bag of nuts. A wave of unease washed over him as he began his descent into the woods. It wasn’t so much a forest as it was a throng of tattered trunks, all singing the same song of inadequate daylight. This place was abandoned, forgotten, the wheels of time unmoving. 

He hadn’t come far before he froze in his steps. There was something in the air, a feeling he had mistaken for his own anxiety. A feeble vibration enveloped him, a gentle yet trembling hum, unlike anything he had ever felt before. It was so calming and comfortable, words that no man would use to describe this decrepit environment. He allowed it to dictate his frame of mind, and a rare rush of relief intoxicated him. The forest had already swallowed him; there was no going back now. He reached into his pockets for his caffeine pills and counted them. He wondered for a second if three pills would suffice, but a feint voice from within reassured him.

The unnamable presence surrounding him became stronger for every step. It was calming, entrancing, yet his senses were sharper than ever. The woods felt like an age-old friend at this point, and he marched on with a sense of curiosity only a child could match.  His newfound excitement wasn’t for long though, as he realized there was nothing here apart from the continuous ocean of trees. No animals, no exotic nature or plants, just him and the ever-present droning. He had since long lost track of time and distance, a bewildering state that drained him of both energy and trust toward his ethereal guide. His mind felt muddled, reasonable thoughts pushed away and replaced with quiet, eerie whispers. Then, out of nowhere he felt a burning sensation on his body, a ray of warmth like he had never experienced. His feet ached in agony as he forced his body into motion, picking up the pace, and he felt as if this queer, radiant glow washed away his discomforts. The murmurs in his mind morphed into malicious moans, displeased and angered by his newfound vigor. He paid them no mind, and ran towards the light.

He had reached the foot of the mountain, but there was no light to be seen. The whispers within had withered away as soon as he left the forest, and the hum was already a fading memory. There was only silence now, and a crushing loneliness brought him to his knees.
It felt as if every aspect of his life bled out of him, memories of friends and family wandering beyond his reach.  A single tangible thought remained, still peering down at him as the fog danced lazily around it. His eyes flared in a shade of unsullied emeralds as he glared back. Determination returned, and he got back on his feet, smiling as he felt the hum envelop him once again. But something was amiss. Ancient instincts cried within as a surge of hostility crept up on him, the once gentle hum was now a blaring horn of unchecked hate that pierced the very essence of his being. His eyes and body failed him, and a strangely familiar pain shot through his face as he fell flat on the mountain. Pure malevolence flooded his body for what seemed like days of suffering, until a soul shattering shriek shattered every concept of existence. A lifeless husk remained, betrayed and ridiculed by the only thing he knew.

A cold breeze swept over the man’s face as he came to, propped up against his car. A resolute hand reached into his pockets for the bottle, ignoring the lonesome rattle of a single pill. He turned to the forest and grinned, seemingly unfazed by the ocean of rust on his vehicle. A sinister hum rustled in the air.

Up until yesterday, I had no problem in saying that.

Many said no, as is natural, but the will of the majority is what imbues the Powers with their authority. The people&amp;rsquo;s choice.

Our Book says that to choose crime is to choose punishment. It falls to me to make sure this is not forgotten, to keep that sentence from ever becoming false. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been ordered, so I&amp;rsquo;ll obey.

In order to stay true to my duty, I&amp;rsquo;ll obey this one command from those who no longer deserve my obedience. I&amp;rsquo;ll behead the body that soiled itself in treason, I&amp;rsquo;ll silence the mouth that uses tender words to conceal schemes and harsh words to discourage opposition.

These are our choices striking back at us. Justice has always been on their side because we&amp;rsquo;ve made them our justice. They decide on our behalf because we elected to place our trust in them. We bow under their leash because we deferred to them to be corrected in our mistakes.

The flickering images before me reveal the rot inside the shining beacon of our free choice. They don&amp;rsquo;t treasure harmony, they step on it.

Before, I trembled for fear of being discovered here. Now I shake of rage for having caught them.

I&amp;rsquo;m a Hand, and a Hand does not forgive.

This is the 2nd draft of my short story. I posted the original through google docs, and the revisions have been applied so you can't see the unedited text - oops... Anyway, I hope this is a more concise effort. Here is the link to google docs if you have formatting induced migraines. Otherwise, let me know what you think.

Some main points of criticism from the last draft were:

* switching of object, without taking the reader along
* overwritten description, or in my own words ""numbling long and full of bullshit prose"" Please tell me worse things, it will help.
* assuming for the reader
* the twist involved isn't properly expressed, and is missed.

I've tried to clear up these issues, but I need new eyes!

And for the plain text enthusiasts....







""Zero zero zero five four"", my hands are drawing the bottles toward me, neck first and under the red beam with a quick rotation of my wrist. The cap cuts the webbing between my fingers and wonder briefly if there’s blood on the lip, if there’s glass in me? My mouth is shut, already too close to the taste of the malty liquid swishing around on the mat beneath my feet, and the rising fumes of tangy sweetbreads.

Cheeking my teeth, and leaning back, my eyes slide over to Michael Litwin, watching as a small glimmer escapes from beneath the long grey skirt of hair surrounding Michael’s friar patch,  his nose realizing the percolation, braces, scrunching a concentrated diversion, that at once is batted away by wide and gone again lashes. Distracted from the bottles in concern, both hands on autopilot ringing through items - my customer hunches forward trying to find something to do with his hands; pockets or counter?

A peppered grey and white wiry handlebar mustache drooped over his broad jowls, Michael looks like Larry from the three stooges. His brown and blue checkered tie is noosed and peeking behind the blue collar shirt half tucked into the back of his black trousers. He looked like your grandpa might look in an unexpected visit, formal though scattered, yet nonetheless happy you came to see him. There is something pretty about this, in a way you’d decide not to mention.

Michael pauses in confusion a few stained once-evergreen tiles away, shuffling sideways running his long index fingernail against the underside of a two-four, large white moons picking and clawing at the yellow packing glue covering the barcode- sweating, for some time now, lips parted in frustration. Right now you could fit a standard “two-fingers-comfortably” in there.  

You need to know Michael’s cues.

""Zero-zero-zero-five-four. That's the code for the Heineken if the barcode is damaged"" deciding it’s time to interject once again, looking over. My hands are now more gingerly scanning the items along while peering over the shoulder of some professional whino. The counter has won. He seems to think we would should make contact. There is a smirk beginning in some blurry corner, fading in and out with the motion as I bring the bottles toward the light.

""I know! I KNOW!"", Michael sputters in frustration, his wide brown eyes turn away pleadingly to the keyboard and screen in front of him, bracing it, reading something square and green that mine can’t make out. Across from his counter was a couple, shifting their feet, exchanging furrowed glances. The same mock hesitance and furrowed look people get when they're about to field a pause in conversation. We want to convey a concerted and dutiful effort. We want to show our process and due thought made beforehand:

1) as to guise an interruption or change in subject

2) assert the end of another's thought (to steer the exchange to our present need or whim)

3) as a semi colon rather than a full stop in giving a shit.

Thats the look someone prepares before they innocently (though on a related thought of course) inquire as to what the fuck you are doing, in the midst of doing or explaining or thinking about whatever the fuck you're doing. This simple massage that, if administered correctly,  eases another's urgent contractions, relieving them of the need to spit up whatever decidedly irrelevant bullshit you've watched their mouth dilate in preparation for. Tactfully satisfying you with a pat on the back while impressing upon everyone the cosmic importance of our time - the concerned and Canadian way. Everyone does it, we know this because, retail. The customers often teach the salesman the importance of a good segue. Cut the shit and make the payment, one of you has to close.

Michael isn't paying attention though.

Michael was constantly on the end of this look. That diligently learned tact, hungrily desired by everyone since their first pregnant pause in a busy day, was useless. That really pissed people off.

“Well ahhhh, maybe if I in-put the ahh—”

“Are you trying to find the code for that? We could grab a different case if it’s taking too long?” The feminine half of the couple is shaking her shoe at the ankle, trying to wag out a little blood while she leans over the counter to an oblivious Michael.
“The Heineken is across from Spain - on the right,”

It made him an honest and kind man to work with though in a way. A challenge. He was impossible to contain, and inconsolable in panic. Conversation became hostage negotiation. Needing to talk this way, It was like being a person again. There was a crisis, there are terms of engagement. You could be saved, If we like you.  It was nice to feel like you were helping out, even grudgingly so, after the days worth of fussing and empty exchanges, with customers and each other.  Insane as he was, he kind of helped my sanity.

Oh, yes — Michael’s cues.

Michael has trouble with social cues and recognizing age. The old man asked everyone who came through his line for ID. You’d see no-longer-yuppie couples with their kids present, be ID'd. Michael knew his weakness in understanding people, though he delighted in being amongst them. So as to avoid any trouble or fine, and as a christian man, he was determined to enforce this check on anyone he served. If you refused, made a fuss, or didn't have it, he wouldn't serve you, no matter your age, it was his rule- his job security. But knowing people thought he was strange, he took great pleasure in fucking with them; keeping an obsessive tally of the people he'd ID on scrap receipt, cackling as each fuming customer left after angry confusion, and he'd ""ruined"" their night. If you abided by the rules, he was a kind and eccentric man, if not, he was a mischievous bastard.

""WHAT ARE YOU RETARDED!? I'M FUCKING THIRTY TWO?""

""Sorry sir, ahh, you might be intoxicated it seems, you're ahhh, awfully angry.""

""Fucking-fucking retard, you're fucking fired. I'm going - shhhit! - I’ll get you fire-""

""OH! aahh you should ask him Mr. Peeters  ahhh nicely if you like, he ahhh might just drive down here and buy the bottle FOR YOU HIMSELF!"" Michael’s voice got higher and he grinned, moustache spread in full territorial display - deranged.

""Well fuck you too you FUCK!""

These exchanges would happen on the regular. This one was a few lines ago.

Soon after we’d kick out whichever impatient asshole was harassing him. This was quality entertainment, but it required work. His line was slow, and we would have to make up for it in speed ourselves during rushes. During the rushes, after the wear of the years, he was scattered and manic, like now.

In my cue, my customer (unprompted) begins to explain to me that the bottles I’m ringing through aren’t just for tonight, that he’s not some sort of alcoholic. Something about friends. People take offense if you don't apply the standard small talk topical treatment.

“Chateau Cheval - flowers and licorice on the nose - earth, caramel, and ripe, sweet blackberries. You getting away this weekend?”

His mouth is a finger open, a knuckle in the middle. He says a girl he knew “used to ride horses, but doesn’t anymore.” Change in hand he leaves me with, that.

Small talk about your shit life; fun. Nobody cares about your hard day - though we do as per company policy, with a smile, and a corporate approved segue. Always Be Segueing. People are always politely giving you an ""opportunity"" for empathy. Sympathy, as a gift - the gift of using your kind words for a human connection so vital. Michael got none of this, just basic pleasantries and quick change exits for him while we watch close by, doing double time on the scanner and waiting for the next bewildered shopper to pass through his line. The next act.

An old man walks up in running shoes, with stained hands, tiny black vessels tracing lines like rosacea in motor oil. He told me once, that he was a professor of photography, that the chemicals he used to process photos etched his hands, and numbed them. They’re two old spoons now, cupped and sun-black. He tells me he doesn’t know how much he has, so a spoon reaches in and scoops out the dimes that he watches me count. He jokes about the blonde in Australia, the one with the cheeks and the collarbones and the red dress. I ask him who he means, I say Australia has a lot of blondes, I say I think but I’ve never been. I say I know a really tall guy from New Zealand, a huge maori guy, he’s a photographer I say, for snowboarding I mean, filmmaking — he chuckles and leaves sideways, beer tucked into his windbreaker, twenty cents short.

It's just safe practice, but you are taught as you work with drunks and deadbeats and addicts and the mentally ill, and life (sometimes as a drunk, deadbeat, mentally ill addict) that you are you are not responsible for empathy, empathy is a responsibility. You cannot care about all these people, you have to choose what to care about. You are responsible only for that choice, and the resulting adjustment of sanity you both are provided. That at some point people stop choosing you, that at some point you won’t be the chooser.

“Have a good evening, sir, and madam!” Michael said, now more composed after his transaction - glue now unstuck. He’s rocking back and forth, pausing a bit longer at his heels, white moons hidden in dark pockets.

You are not responsible for their shitty life. You are to be responsible only for your own measured obligations - those are your own interventions. Resulting fines or emotional repercussions you agree to accept.

You are not responsible for their shitty life.

“Uhh thanks Zach, it just these ahhh darn buttons... I ahhh don’t have my glasses today. You know they ah didn’t have  the codes ahh—”

He says the word today like two-day, round and fat and knuckle thick.

“No problem, Michael,” I say, “We’re doing good tonight.”

Day after day, drink after drunk; the notion of three hundred thousand dollars worth of debt in fines for fucking up and serving somebody you shouldn't; the boiling hate you have for anyone seeking the best vodka (Tito’s is my favourite) - you realize the concerted effort needed to give a shit anymore. Caring did nothing for anyone in the first place. Your poor imitation of giving a shit at four o'clock on a Tuesday, meant the same to Mary as your honest advice at six pm on a Thursday; they just want to be sweet talked. This realization breaks something in you. Learn the transaction and thank them for sharing (read: shopping). Anyone you do find affinity with and are responsible to - you are an abettor to their sickness, and in fact it's your job to do it with a smile. The liquor store is socially and in practice assumed a god given right if you're convincingly sober. Like milk, bread, and the time of day during business hours.

My fingers curl around the register, head nodding over the next customer - then, hips pushing back, arching, stretching - just in time to bob back up to meet them with a new smile, two rows gapped and two-fingers-comfortably. Something rubs at me from within my front right pocket, edges sharp and moist, tangy sweetbreads. There is a smile in my blurry corner.

“Somebody shit themself in france”

“Thanks.”

“I think they dropped their vodka, it smells boozy too”

 “Thanks, I’ll get right on it.”

The liquid permeates you. That antiseptic warmth that soaks you through until all you smell are fumes and you can’t feel the glass underneath your skin. A serial whodunnit for your liver and it’s brainy sidekick, a new mystery every morning.

Have you pissed yourself or are you just happy to be alive?

These are my two minds. Our cognitive dissonance. But we share the sickness, it’s our sickness. We nod along in the exchange, the hurried and frustrated consoling caresses we touch ourselves with, smiling at each other from across the counter, we might politely reach around now and then, and lending a hand-

“Is that the total?”

Michael really is the best of us.

No making choices now. Mine are pretend. My work, kneading my bullshit each shift, working out the air, harvesting each good bit like sour dough for the next day’s batch and new open mouths, new teeth and hands and fingers comfortably. I am your shame and hope every night. I am the perfect and expendable employee of liquor retail. That eagerness to adapt, I need to share. Why?

If everyone else thinks they're so damn important, even politely so - if nobody gives a shit anyway - If everyone's sickness is small talk, and neither party intends anything else; than my sickness doesn't matter, and I must be more important than them, because, fuck it - I'm me.

Fuck all of us.

The photograph next to my dresser stood out the most. I had many pictures taped to the walls in my room, and they had vivid memories, but not this one. It was so intriguing because it didn’t mean anything to me. 
The photographs had to have a special back story to win a place in my bedroom. They were collections of my best times trapped in a frozen moment stored in my camera. They deserved to be hung up so I could relive those moments with just a glance.
 Majority of them captured birthdays or holidays, group gatherings and outdoor adventures, memorable ones, of course. The pictures taken of us posed in a group, “Smile on the count of three – wait, wait, it was blurry!” are nice to keep, especially if some of those friends are gone or sick or they moved.
The pictures taken spontaneously or on accident are the best, however. I have so many photos with a random friend laughing, taken at the perfect second with my elbow unknowingly hitting the flash button, or sitting on my camera and the flash captures a surprised face stuffed with cake. My photos are printed within the next morning on glossy rectangles and taped to the wall that same afternoon. 
An off limits section of the wall closest to my book shelf is for my modeling pictures and my hardcore professional photography only. No one needs to know that they’re taken by a little girl and that they’ve never been published. I like to think they’re taken straight from a Photoshop magazine or an America’s Next Top Model episode but in reality, they’re mixed with pictures of myself and pictures of the garden in the back. 
I love my camera and I take it with me everywhere. I dedicate much spare time to capturing the right picture. But the photo next to my dresser stood out the most. It was so intriguing because it didn’t mean anything to me.
It was faded, with thin bronze edges. There was young couple in their early twenties. The man with a thin mustache wore a tank top with swim trunks and big flip flops. The woman with straight brunette hair wore denim shorts and a t-shirt. She carried an infant wearing footypajamas and a small sunhat. I didn’t know who these people were or who the baby was, but the photo has been on my wall ever since I first got my camera.



“Channel 7 News is gay. Who the fuck replays the same shit all morning? Like, I watched the same reports an hour ago, I don’t need to see it again” Cooper complains. 
I chuckle.
“Gay!” He shouts at the TV, then storms out of the room. 
“You’re going to miss breakfast!” I call.
I use the spatula to scrape pancakes off the pan and stack them onto a plate. I do the same with scrambled eggs and bacon. I pour two cups of orange juice and two cups of milk. The food is displayed on the counter to resemble a buffet, with silverware next to the eggs. 
I walk over to the couch and pick up the remote, stained with dry peanut butter. To prevent another outburst from Cooper I change the channel. I draw the curtains to let the sun seep through the sliding glass door and devour the living room. Without it the living room would be dark, a dull gray, and cloudy with cigarette smoke.
The sun hurts a little and I need to adjust my eyes. Eventually I see past the sun’s morning rays which layers over the wooden patio. The plastic table is cluttered with ashtrays and beer bottles. Wait. Is that my lighter?
I slide the door open. My feet tip toe across the deck glazed with morning dew. It makes my heels sticky, which I really don’t like, but I grab my lighter and rush back inside. I wipe them dry on the carpet. The door makes a whoosh sound as I slide it closed. 
My lighter sits in my palm and I stare at it. I almost don’t believe it. I’ve been missing this lighter for so long. Cooper has told me countless times he hasn’t seen it, but I’ve caught him in his little lie now. He’s been using it while partying with his friends. And the evidence is right outside.
“Oh, Cooper!” I shout mockingly. “Oh, Coopy Poopy!”
I countdown from three in my head and he walks in on cue. Cooper strolls into the living room, but smells the hot-and-ready breakfast, and changes his quick pace to the kitchen.

He dreamed of the dead.

This one, like so many others before, took him back to Hallow Hill during the deep winter, before the Blood Plague came. The whole House came together and fires would be lit in the hearths as cousins and uncles would tell their tales of gallantry from the previous year. They would speak of exploits at the Bridge, a narrow pass through the vast mountains separating the east and the west, or across the Skipping Stones, a series of islands that bridged the gap between the Twin Cities that looked at one another over the Sea of Stars.  

Kevan, his cousin and Thegn of North’s End, was only a year older but already faced pirates in the Stones and gained renown among the Freeholds and Halls there. They would toast him and beautiful women would flock to his bed. Then there was Jacen, his father’s youngest brother, called the Scourge of Tallendale. Every year he would ride down the brigands who raided along the Bridge in the name of Halloway. His coursers were the most magnificent animals in the kingdom, everyone said.

In his dreams his mother was still alive and he saw that she was tall and beautiful and kind. She laughed and everyone would laugh with her, charmed by the sound. She had raven hair, like he did, and would come to him at the window seat where he always liked to read. She would say to the assembly, “Do you see here, this is my son.” Then she would lay her hand on his head and smile. “A beautiful boy. He reads and knows so much, more than any boy could know. Come, tell us a story my son, sing us your best tale.”

But inevitably the dream would spin out of control and she would wither and die like she had after he’d been born. Like Kevan and Jacen, the Blood Plague rose within her during the pregnancy. She lived just long enough to birth him in a bed full of blood. His father always spoke of how she died calling out his name.

He woke to the sensation of being kicked. It was not a gentle nudge but neither was it meant to injure. Paul woke slowly, the world of dreams melting away much like ice during spring. The first thing he became aware of was the pain. His left arm felt like it had been dipped in boiling oil. Every move of his hand or arm sent throbbing, sharp pains into him where the splinters of his shield tore through his mail and padded jacket. His shoulder felt odd and he discovered he could not raise it. It was stuck, jammed against something. It hurt to move and he groaned from the pain.

“So you aren’t dead after all,” said a voice that seemed only half-real to him as he curled up tighter into a ball. The sun was up; he could feel it through the bush’s brambles. It was a fading sun however and he knew it must be late in the day. He’d always been able to tell the time without even opening his eyes, but he knew many useless things.

*A Calling of nothing*, he thought. *Just like father said.*

“Can you move? Hello?” The voice was young. At first he thought that Jack had found him. He would have been undone then, his shame complete. Word would travel back to his father and that would be the end of him. No noble could stand a coward and his father least of all. He would name another successor, Loukas perhaps. But my uncle is dead.

“Jack?” he asked, slowly opening his eyes. Beneath the shrub, the world was cast in shadow and shade and Paul was happy for it. Even the small amount of sunlight that came through made his eyes burn and tear up. There was someone standing over him. The first thing he saw was a pair of leather shoes that looked well worn and soft. They were low with laces across the top that wound up the ankle and calf. Not Jack then, he thought with some relief. “Eh?” the voice said again, and this time he knew it was a girl.

He blinked again and his vision began to clear. Looking up, he saw she wore a simple woolen dress that was patched and dirty. She wore no stockings beneath and where her ankles showed her skin bore bramble scars both old and new. When he finally saw her face, he stared.

She was his age at least, perhaps older, with straw colored hair that was darker near the root. Her face was pinched, her dark eyes narrow and suspicious. A long nose swept gently upward at the tip just above a small mouth that seemed used to scowling. Freckles dotted her cheeks, some in thicker patches, some in lighter ones.

“What are you doing in a hedge?” the girl asked. He tried to shrug but the pain in his shoulder inspired only a grunt. “If it were up to me I’d say you were being stupid. Look you’ve bled all over your metal shirt and the brambles have scratched your face to ribbons.”

“Go away,” he said. “Leave me alone.”

“You can’t bloody well stay here. C’mon, let’s get you out of there before you cut yourself worse.”

Getting him out from under the hedge proved to be harder than he’d imagined, making him wonder how he’d managed to get into it in the first place. She pulled at him, jarring his shoulder and causing him to cry out in pain. Then she accidentally touched the wounds on his arm.

“Weaver’s Blood!” he cried and tried to pull away. “I’m not some lummox ox boy you can handle like… like…” He reached for a word, something to make her stop but his mind was numb with pain. Her words were hard but quiet. “Like a boy caught in a briar bush?”

He fell into silence then, his anger abated. They eventually found where he was snagged and she pulled his belt knife. For a moment he froze in terror but she only cut the ensnaring branch and with his help, pulled him free of the hedge and onto soft grass.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1hzc79,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1hzc79/feedback_hallow_hill_part_4_continuation_of_my/,

On second thought, it now seems to have always been wrong. I&amp;rsquo;m confused, in shock, a mix in between or none of it at all. Things that used to paint a picture as clear as day now are muddled, blurred, faded&amp;mdash;and yet as sharp as ever.

No, that analogy wasn&amp;rsquo;t good. What&amp;rsquo;s a better word, what is it&amp;hellip; Oh.

Yes. A lie.

The uniform I used to wear so proudly before the crowds now seems to reek of death. Are my hands really clean? While part of me wants to claim I&amp;rsquo;m innocent, because I knew nothing at the time, the other half screams *guilty* now that the deception seems so glaringly obvious. Both halves agree on one thing, though: I was stupid, I have been used, and the only way to make amends with my conscience will have me killed.

That would actually be sweet justice, come to think of it. Damn, why have I always been so quick to use that word? Those words. Greater good, lawfulness, righteousness, the way things are meant to be &amp;mdash; what do I think I am, a Man of Law? A stupid parrot, more like. An oaf with borrowed claws, their lender all too eager to have me use them given the slightest opportunity, all too willing to reward me copiously for saving the Powers from bleeding.

I&amp;rsquo;m a tool, and I was glad to think of myself as an instrument. My Mistress reaches out through me and has her will made true. My most sacred tenet, their justification for my deeds, was my justification too. But now it sounds like an excuse, their way of keeping *their* hands clean.

For the greater good, I shall die. Today.

Seth makes his way home, after being out for some time, the moon having taken the place of the sun, the rain having subsided to a degree, but water still slipping from the clouds. Walking through the village streets, the roads and paths empty, the streetlights on.

“No” Seth whispers, directing his attention to the left, without turning his head, glimpsing a shadow moving amongst shadows.

“It’s too soon” Seth keeps checking left and right, and dips into an alley way across the road to his right.
“You noticed, I’m impressed” A male voice speaks from behind Seth, both of them in the alley way, Seth turns around to face him. “Now then are you running from me, or something else?” 

“You’re probably after me” Seth grins menacingly, spying the machine bracelet on his wrist.

“You don’t even want to know who I work for?” The man asks, his face barely visible in the darkness, but a well built man lacking hair is discernible. 

“It matters little” Seth responds, no emotion in his voice, his right hand glistening a pale blue, a chill spreads through the alley. “I can’t allow you to live”

“Why you” The man says arming his machine, a hulking white titan of a machine, nearly so wide as to hit both walls of the alley. Seth’s right arm covered in a thin layer of ice now.

“Your life means nothing to me either, we only need your blood” The man roars at Seth.

“You’ve made a mistake” Earth expands from the walls of the houses that make up the alleyway, the moonlight stretching down from the sky, the only way out of the alleyway now. “You shouldn’t have came alone, but you knew that didn’t you, you didn’t know who I was, which means your organization doesn’t know I’m here” 

“I can call you in, I’ll be a hero” The man says tapping an ear piece. 

“Don’t bother, I disabled it” Seth’s voice, dead now. The man stunned. “You can’t fly up either, your machine is too big”

“Please, mercy” The man begs, his voice shaking, Seth raises his ice covered arm up, his hand like a claw. The man charges him, a great sword materializing in a white mist.

“Sorry” Seth murmurs, the man wouldn’t have been able to hear under his feet stomping across the ground, ice branches out of Seth’s hand at incredible speed, stretching like a tree, the ice razor sharp as runs the man through, piercing cleanly through the machine, the ice supporting the weight of the man and his machine as his body slumps, blood erupting from his mouth, his eyes widening. The ice shatters into nothing, melting and then nothing, the man falls to the ground limp, his machine laden with holes. Seth walks away unscathed. The man dead.

We have a new feature on this sub - a voice chat room running off a Ventrilo server owned by /u/Itaryum.

&gt;In his own words:  

&gt;Hey all. For a long while I have wanted to have a Ventrilo or similar server to
allow writers from all over the world to chat, I also think it would be useful for
bouncing ideas around and offering advice to each other and a great place to
make friends and talk to those you meet on Reddit and other places, also it might
help keep some people motivated to continue writing, I know i`ll be one of
them. So I bought a Ventrilo server and if anyone is interested in getting involved
and forming a little VOIP writing community then feel free to come on the server
and chat. 
&gt;Hostname: vent32.gamespeak.com
&gt;Port: 4248

 This allows writers to speak in various chat channels with fellow writers much like a telephone conference call, to obtain feedback, advice, ask questions and most importantly it allows for better collaboration with your writing partners / buddies than over E-mail.

We have a full walkthrough [here](HTTP://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/wiki/)
and if you have any problems please message the moderators. 

We leave it to you and your writing partners as to when you want to chat, but we will try to have larger writers group meetings on the server on topics of interest, Andrew that would benefit from a more interactive real time approach.

The Mossfields came around the bend and he could not see the end of their line. Twice my number, easily. Jack looked at him, but Paul did not see any hint of fear on the boy. *Perhaps my father should have given him the ring.*

“You’ll want to speak to Lord Mossfield himself if he’s here. Do not treat with anyone lower than your station,” Loukas said as their group moved to meet them.

Lord Mossfield was easy to spot. Enormously fat, he wore a green enameled breastplate large enough to fit Rock. Where his head met his shoulders there was only rolls of flesh beneath a small chin and a wide mouth with thick, purple lips. The top of his head was bald where the crown of Mossfield sat. Most Lords wore a chain and cloak but the frog lord chose a crown.

Even in the cool wind the lord was sweating and smelled of the bogs. Jack coughed and Paul nearly gagged. He kept his composure as best he could and advanced Rock up to meet him. Jack and Loukas came as well.

“Well,” said Lord Mossfield in a high-pitched, nasally voice. Before he went on, he snapped thick fingers and a retainer placed a frog leg in his hand. The lord slobbered the snack down quickly and went on, Paul too taken aback to interject. “So it seems I was right, the old raven sends a boy to treat with us! A weakly son from an enfeebled Lord.”

“That’s Sir Paulin to you, my Lord.” Each word was bit through clenched teeth. The frog lord shrugged massive shoulders and coughed, causing spittle to spray over Rock’s raven-shaped mantle. The destrier didn’t even flinch as it slid down the molded beak near his nose.

“As you say, child.” Mossfield’s grin split his fat face, showing rotting teeth. His foul breath wafted toward him and Paul fought the urge to vomit. The irritation and anger that boiled inside of him was surprisingly strong and his left hand flexed, wanting his sword. “This man is Lord Halloway’s own son, Heir to Hallow Hill.” Loukas’s voice was strong and even, commanding the fat lord to listen.

“I act in his name and goodwill,” Paul added, though his voice sounded shaky and boyish. “Treat with me as you would him.”

Mossfield roared in laughter, which soon spread to the guardsmen around him. Loukas halted Paul from drawing his sword. When it finally stopped, Paul was red from anger. Lord Mossfield slapped his giant belly and the metal breastplate rang from the golden rings on his fingers. “The child wishes to treat with me as if he was his father!” More snickers erupted by the frog lord went on before it came to laughter again. “Fine, boy, fine. But I’ll have you know I would sooner treat with a dog than your lot, your sick father or not.”

“We came in good faith,” Paul bit out. “Our commonfolk are being double taxed, the land south of the river is my father’s. They should not also pay tithe to you.”

Mossfield took another frog leg from his retainer and chewed it, his fat lips smacking noisily. In the meanwhile, he noticed that the lord’s horse was having trouble supporting the weight. *He must change them out every few hours so as not to kill them.*

It wasn’t until he sucked the marrow from the bones that he answered Paul. “These folk here, ‘long the river, see,” Mossfield said, tossing away the last of the leg bones and wiping the back of his hand along his lips. “They don’t even know who your father is. They haven’t paid noble tithe to him in so long they forgot how it’s done. So I made them mine and if your father wants’em back he can come get them himself, by the old custom, with sword and blood. But it’s been years, why trouble himself now?”

*Father wanted it done, that it was about honor*, Paul thought even as Mossfield’s words made him pause. What the fat lord said was true, yet… “These lands are by rights the property of Lord Halloway. Regardless of what you say, they should not pay tithe to you.”

Lord Mossfield giggled, his enormous bulk jiggling. “An untested boy and an old man came to tell me who should or should not pay tithe to me? I have a very good reason why they should, raven child.” He held up a thick hand and waved someone forward.

The crowd quickly parted to reveal the largest man Paul had ever seen. He was easily seven feet tall and unlike Lord Mossfield, it was not fat that caused his girth but hulking muscle. The brute wore plate and chain with spikes at the shoulders and tips of his boots. In his hands he held a thick hammer with a head as thick as Paul’s thigh. His shield bore no House markings but the green enamel about its edge claimed him as one of Mossfield’s knights. He rode no horse. *No horse would sit beneath him, except perhaps Rock.*

“The Bearkiller,” Loukas whispered, almost sounding defeated. Paul frowned and looked at his uncle. “Why do they call him Bearkiller? Is it because he’s as big as a bear?”

“No, he killed a bear.”

“My father lanced a bear at his wedding.”

“This man,” Loukas said with a nod of his head at the giant that came to stand next to his Lord. “Did so with his bare hands.”

Paul went white.

fourth and the first to actually order a beer. Huh.


After ten minutes of silence (the bartender hadn't even spoken), he finished the
first beer and ordered another. He tried to make the bartender talk, tried to
beg the words from the man's mouth. It didn't work. He gave up. There was mist
drifting in from the cracked door. It had been drizzling earlier and the lips of
his shoe souls were still damp and making his socks uncomfortable. He flicked
over the half full pintglass with the back of his hand, spilling the beer onto
the bar. He watched the bartender approach. The man brought a towel, pushed the
foaming puddle off onto the interior floor of the bar, probably wetting his own
feet in turn, and then walked away again to resume putting away a rack of washed
glasses.


""Goddammit.""


I watched an cartoon yesterday. I think it made me crazy.


A middle aged woman opened the door. Her greying blonde hair was damp and a warm
gust exhaled into the bar ahead of her. She walked over to where the other,
original three were sitting. They were all drinking water in silence. The
bartender brought her a water too. No words exchanged.


It's called anime. I hate it. There are boy heroes and women exploding at the
breast and young girls written just innocent enough to be craved by millions of
creepy shut-ins. I guess I love it then too. Why else would I watch over eight
hours without leaving my bed.


""Hey, whore. Come over here.""


The greyed woman didn't respond. She didn't move at all. His grip tightened
on the pintglass.

I watched a story of a young boy losing his mind. I could see the little barbed
hooks of his life ripping away at his brain piece by piece. I saw it on the
screen. I could hear the screams as he tore at the hooks, helpless and primal
and innocent. Like a small animal, a puppy maybe, being torn apart.


The bartender had finished hanging the glasses. He took the spilt glass, rinsed
it, and took it back to the kitchen. While the bartender was gone, he reached
over the bar, grabbed a glass and pulled the draft. As the bartender returned,
he waved it in his face.


""I stole this. What are you going to do?""

The bartender walked over to the other end of the bar and refilled the water
glasses.


I loved every second of it. I couldn't look away from the horror unfolding on
the screen, the subtle majesty of that internal apocalypse. The agony of a mind cracking
apart, the fear of what danger could be lurking beyond. The dilated
heat of firm breasts mounted on a suspiciously young woman. The thin, lanky legs
sprouting from an impossibly scarce skirt. The lurching ecstacy of climaxing to
all of the above. The shame and black hilarity of the next moment's reflection.


Is there beauty here? Maybe. Is it beauty to exploit the dark and carnal kernel of my mind, to tunnel past the guards and wreck havoc behind the castle wall? To be seduced by Helen riding a suspiciously large horse? I exhaled and surrendered the smallest key to the kingdom, not knowing that the reason the key was so small in the first place was to avoid attention to the door it was created to open. Maybe there was beauty there, but is there any beauty in what it's done to me? If I take my fingers and pick and pull at my own skull, will it still be beautiful when it's over?


He stood up and drained his pintglass. He wound back and threw it at the back of the bartender's head. The glass exploded from the skull in a crystalline shower and crashed to the floor. The bartender never flinched, the motions of his cleaning towel never deviating from their small, circular pattern.


He stood there in silence, his face draining to a horrible white paleness. He burst through the door to the bar, sprinting terrified into the rain.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1h0vz0,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1h0vz0/critiqueits_raining_and_the_paint_is_washing_off/,

Ransom: A Bo Spade Story, Chapter 1

Friday, October 5
6:45 PM

His phone rattled against his car keys and Swiss army knife in the right front pocket of his jeans. Bo ignored it as he listened as Ezra told a story to the blonde across the bar about him and Bo from years ago when, on the spur of the moment, the two had taken a road trip to Panama beach. Either the scotch was truly starting to have a long-term effect on his memory, or the trip had never developed beyond the drunken idea phase years ago. He took another sip from his glass as he reassured himself that these were the sorts of stories that Ezra loved to invent to impress the younger, dumber generation of blondes that always seemed to find themselves seated within ear shot of the two of them.

O’Bannon’s looked how it looked every Friday at about this time. As many of the few patrons who enjoyed their after work cocktails at this early hour were a bit older than Bo and Ezra, it would be hard for a newcomer to expect that just three hours from then the place would be completely transformed. First, the pool hustlers would arrive and begin to warm up in the back room as they waited patiently for tonight’s fresh blood to show up with their thick wallets and thicker skulls. Shortly after, a local band and its few lone groupies would set the stage in the main room. Bo and Ezra, however, preferred the third and smallest room that they were already in. “The Library,” as it was affectionately referred, was a smaller room that connected to both the back and main rooms. Bo preferred it because of its large, comfortable booths, lightly played jazz music in the background, and beautiful mahogany bar. Ezra preferred its strategically located bathrooms that forced every woman in the place to pass by at least once during the evening.

The phone buzzed in his pocket again. This time, two quick vibrations, immediately followed by a series of longer ones. Two text messages and another phone call? At first he assumed he must have left something off of the report that he had done that day, but immediately realized that the department never bothered him on Friday nights. Friday nights were the one night a week that he had demanded to not be disturbed. Fridays were reserved for him and Ezra to do what they did best. 

Finally, Bo retrieved the phone from his pocket as the screen began to dim, indicating that it was on its final ring. He saw his father’s name flashing on the screen. What could he want? The two hadn’t spoken in months. 

“Dad, I’m out wi---“

“Robert. It’s your father.” Robert. The name sounded so foreign to Bo. His father was the only person who insisted on referring to him by his given name. Still, the anxiousness of his father’s voice surprised him. As he breathed heavily on the other end of the line, he continued.

 “It’s about Christina,”

 “What’s wrong with her? Is she upset?”

“No. No. Well, probably. I don’t know. Malcolm just called.  Something is wrong. Very wrong. He said that Christina has been taken.”

“Taken? The hospital again?”

“No! She has been taken. She is being fucking held hostage. Or for ransom. Or something. I don’t know what the hell is going on. Malcolm just called and that’s all he said before he hung up.”

Bo felt his heart attempting to escape the strict confines of his strong chest. His sister? Taken? How much scotch had he had? Or perhaps his father was the one drunk this time. What was he rambling on about? He was used to getting these sorts of phone calls from Christina, but never from their father. His older sister, a lifelong victim of bi-polar disorder, had often called him frantically for one reason or the other. Ever since Bo was old enough to speak he had a special bond with his sister. Whenever she was upset, all she needed was his ear to help calm her down. He had forgotten that his father was still on the line.

“Bo?! Hello?! Are you there?! Get your ass over here!”

“Are you sure you understood right, Dad?”

“Either Malcolm has given me another reason to hate him, or something terrible has happened to your sister. No matter what, we need you over here.” The sound of his father hanging up resonated in his ears like feedback from an amplifier. He immediately felt nauseated as he stumbled off his stool. 

Ezra glanced at him and saw the color drain from his face. He immediately knew that something was wrong. He and Bo had only gotten to O’Bannon’s an hour ago, and his oldest friend could handle more than two glasses of Chivas.

“Bo?! What is it, man? You don’t look so good.”

Bo found it more and more difficult for his feet to find the floor. The voice of his friend may as well have been coming from across the street, as he strained to even remember where he was.

Bo glanced around the bar. Everyone’s eyes were locked onto his, a look of terror pouring out of each and every one of their unblinking eyes. The blonde that Ezra had been talking to gazed at him, her chin nearly coming to rest on the top of the bar as her jaw silently fell. The complete silence that fell over the bar was deafening. Bo felt as though his entire world had been changed in an instant. He felt his friend shaking his shoulder, desperately trying to get his attention.

“Ezra, I have to go. It’s about Christina.”

Ezra didn’t ask a single question. The two had been friends since high school and since then over a decade had passed. The two trusted each other’s judgment completely. Anytime the other had ever needed anything, no matter how large or how small, the other had always given it without question. Each of them knew that the trust they had earned was rare on this Earth, and they never took it for granted. Without a moment’s hesitation, Ezra slapped Bo across the face. The warm sensation across his left cheek immediately cleared his head. His sister was in trouble. He had to go. Ezra was yelling at him.

“Get the hell out of here!”

Without a word, Bo sprinted out of the bar and headed toward his car. How could something like this happen to his sister? And why? What could she have possibly gotten herself into? She had a foul temper, but as she had grown older, she had found outlets for it.  Bo ripped the door open and piled in. He yanked his keys out his pocket and jammed them into the ignition. The Camaro roared to life as he dropped the clutch and slammed his foot onto the accelerator. The smell of rubber filled the air as the tires begrudgingly tried to find traction on the slick asphalt of the parking lot. Finally, the tires caught and all that was left behind was the scent of burned rubber and gasoline.

Immediately, John put the radio down and let the banal country music play on. As he listened to the guitar twang along to the mournful lyrics, he thought to himself how confusing this all was. How wrong this all was! In his dissatisfaction, John began to retort with a long parade of reasons why he simply didn’t want to listen to country music...but he managed to seize himself before he let any words leave his mouth. He knew this job was important; that’s what Emily told him, and that’s all he needed.

“I’m sorry Ms. Flausterson, I won’t mess with your radio no more. Do you want some chocolates ma’am?” asked the simple Mr. Sterbob. “Of course I do, what do you think? My mouth is open...and the chocolates are over there...and your hands are empty, not filled with chocolates being put in my mouth. Stop doing what you’re not doing and help me out!”, demanded Megan.

John Sterbob sighed heavily, and proceeded to insert the gourmet German chocolates into his boss’ demanding mouth. As he performed his menial labor, he reflected on the state of his life; Emily had told him often lately that, “You are not responsible for this job honey.” He attempted to reflect on what she meant by that. Did she mean that his presence in this “Meagan’s” life was not a result of his actions? Was she trying to say that whether he performed to Meagan’s expectations or not wasn’t important? Perhaps she was implying that Meagan’s current life situation wasn’t his responsibility. More questions…every day, more and more questions. 

It had been a while since John took a moment to look at the room he worked with Meagan in. For a nice building, it was a rather plain room; sparse and sterile, with the only items belonging in it being Meagan’s desk (and the office supplies on it), her wheelchair, a picture of Meagan and an unknown man, and of course, Meagan herself. John never really felt like he was supposed to be in this room every day, helping this woman he couldn’t remember meeting with her daily activities. It all seemed very foreign to him…the only place he felt like he belonged to was his house he had with Emily. There were too many times in the past week when John would find himself being in Meagan’s office and feeling like he was invisible, only allowed to exist when Meagan told him to. At their house though? He was the center of all the attention…and yet, it was at this point in his thought process when John became aware of a noise yelling at him, demanding his attention…with dread, he realized it was Meagan barking at him. 

“John, you brainless, ugly piece of shit! This lab report is due in 25 minutes, and do you see me capable of typing it myself? No. Get your ass over to the computer and type what I say!” The defeated shell dragged himself to the computer, sat down, and began typing Meagan’s words. As demeaning as this part of the job was, John found that it was a good way to make time pass, and it helped him focus on something other than the massive amount of questions that were always prancing around inside his mind. Before he knew it, the report was done, and Meagan crudely released John from his duties for the day. While it was a small victory for John to be free of this place, he knew it would only be a matter of hours before he was there again the next day.

Don't hold back any punches. This is a narrative based off those rebellious teenage years we've all been through, hope you enjoy it!*

A Mild Case of Anarchy

Silence. Nothing but silence. It’s an eerie feeling, suddenly realizing your actions. The low hum of the refrigerator ran out, and as the background was nothing but emptiness, the only thing making noise was the crackling of my burning cigarette while taking a drag and the rusty seat shifting beneath me. I wonder if they know, that I still deliberately disobey them. What was once a rush of excitement became a habit. Waiting until one in the morning, walking slowly down the creaky hardwood hallway to check if my mother was still asleep, and then galloping back to the garage to begin my small deed of anarchy, was now normal. 

The cherry of the Marlboro 100 was running low and I began to feel the heat transfer from the tip of the cigarette to the filter and burn my lips. The smoke was close to my face and began to flow into my eyes, causing an irritation that could only be solved by rubbing my corneas and closing my lids the following drag. The burn on my lips was now too much to bare, and the nicotine rush began to fade. I can only relax for those brief minutes, so I dip the butt into the ashtray, making sure that any of bright red of the cherry was smothered so as not to show its ugly face in the pitch black. Checking that everything was the way it was when I got there, I climbed the small brick steps, closed the door and ran back to my room to write this note. By now the nicotine is completely out of my bloodstream and a sense of normalcy has returned to my mood. The pepsi I grabbed on the way back has a certain spice to it from the ashy taste leftover in my mouth. 

I don’t try to disappoint my family, it just sort of happens. Smoking weed was far too expensive and difficult to hide, in my urine, my lack of cash, and the lingering smell it left in my bathroom. So I picked up smoking, my parents are both fucking chimneys compared to my once daily cigarette, so it’s not hard to start. If you go through a pack a day you don’t really notice one smoke fewer. The smell has clouded their senses for so many years they can’t smell the smoke in my hair or taste the tobacco when they kiss me goodnight. Every time they would catch me breaking a rule it would always follow the same pattern. My mom would try to comfort me and figure out what it was that drove me to this decision, I would bust out some half ass excuse that my dad would see right through it and start screaming at me, waking up my sister because it always happened late at night, and then I would promise that this was the last time. At least of course until another two months when I would pick it back up. I think they’ve caught on to this formula, and just accepted it like I did.

Truth is I have no clue why I do what I do. Of course I feel these depressing moods and anxiety, but I have the meds for that, and it’s certainly not my motivation whenever I go smoke. It just relaxes me and that’s that. The mixture of adrenaline from sneaking out and the nicotine of the cigarette just work so well together, like a cocktail of natural and artificial buzzes that help me sleep at night.      

I do hope that I someday I won’t be dependent on these things to keep me going. Zoloft only takes you so far and cigarettes seem to last shorter and shorter the more you smoke. My peers seem to get along just fine without them, but I’m sure everyone has their own vice. I know for a fact that most of the “popular kids” (how cliché) love to get hammered on the weekends and then complain about how their friends are all superficial. I don’t know if all of them use these parties as an escape or if they just like getting fucked up like everyone else seems to. Some I know have difficult home lives, divorce, parental affairs, money trouble, death, the usual grievances. Knowing about all these make me feel both lucky that I don’t have to deal with the misfortunes that befall most youths, and guilty that I feel so shitty for seemingly trivial matters. So I guess I’m at no position to judge why they get drunk, dance and lose their phones in the crowd of grinding hormones.
The years of high school will run out eventually, that I look forward to. Not because I’m the stereotype of the lonely boy who is misunderstood by his parents and listens to depressing music while fantasizing about losing his virginity. I’m just simply looking forward to simplicity. Having a nine to five job that pays decent in a major metropolitan area while I spend my nights either with my thoughts or with a beautiful young woman who is just as strange as I am sounds serene. It’s not the typical teenage fantasy, but I don’t see the attraction to an overly glamorous lifestyle. I’m perfectly comfortable floating my way through life. 

So as I lay back and finish up my existential crisis for the evening, I plan how tomorrow night’s cigarette break will go and if I can keep up the charade of a “good boy” any longer. Maybe tomorrow I’ll wake up and not feel the urge to over analyze my surroundings and my future, but for now, I live day to day at the whims of a smothered Marlboro cherry in a pitch black garage.

*Lest we forget, the demon inside of us really shine out when it comes to helping the less unfortunate.*

Gales of laughter and cheer erupted by the roadside as the boy with his thick, stubborn hair plastered to his head failed to hit the ball and it went past him, knocking out the makeshift wicket off its stand. He was annoyed, all right. It had been the third time he had missed the ball that day. His mates were furious; he had bought them down with his incompetence, yet he didn't so much as admitted that he lacked the skill.

Far across on the other side of the road stood a little boy, observing the commotion. He could scarcely hear what transpired at the other side, yet he had a pretty good idea what was going on. Streams of cars and bikes and buses and a few carts pulled by horses rushed in front of him as he waited for the light to turn red. He was dressed in a shirt poked full of holes, and shorts garnished with mud stains that covered him just above his knees. Asphalt kissed his bare feet with heat of scorching sun. He was growing out of his clothes, and needed a pair of shoes.

The light signalled red, but the vehicles did not stop. He was aware that would happen. He went down the road, nearly escaping a Honda Accord, almost dropping his bundle of ballpoint-pens. The window rolled down and with it came the yelling of the driver--he chose to ignore him and strode towards the other side. He was good at ignoring. It’s something a boy like Ahmad had to have to filter out the world around him. Obscenities were nothing but hackneyed to him. On reaching the other side, he caught his breath. Beads of sweat dangled from his chin as he gasped for air. He had to shout at the top of his lungs now--he hadn't sold  a single pen this afternoon.

Blue, black, and a couple red pens here and there clutched in his tender hands, he shouted; his voice porpoising. Most chose to ignore him; some slowed down to see what was at sell and moved on, disinterested. He was dizzy, the heat had been overwhelming, yet he could not stop now. His mother lay sick in bed, his infant sister too weak to even cry out. He sat down on a block of concert staring wide around him. In that time, he saw a mother struggling to keep hold of her daughter. Her fingers curled around a cone lade with vanilla flavoured ice-cream; drops of melted cream raced down the curves of her fat fingers, dripping on to her shirt. “But I want the pretzels!” She snarled. Her mother caught Ahmad gazing into the ice-cream. “Fine. Lets go inside,” her mother snapped back at her. Whatever it took to get out of boy’s piercing glare.

He wanted to go home. Curl up beside her mother, caressing her sweet sister’s head.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1fd5ee,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1fd5ee/first_attempt_at_writing_500_words_incomplete/,

I suppose I should have seen it coming. It’s quite clear in retrospect, now that I think about it. The mood swings. The weird food cravings. The antennas that grew out of her when she became angry. But when you're young and in love, it’s easy to miss such signs. I should have listened to my friends. “She’s not good enough for you,” they would say. “She`s weird.” “She has green feet and eats the neighbour’s pets.” But the heart sees what it wants to see, and I put my doubts about Lily to one side and soon fell for her.

Looking back, I can see that Lily was a bit...special, almost from the day I met her 6 months ago. Perhaps it was her nonchalant grace as she hovered across the campus to meet me for our dates. Maybe it was her (literally) glowing blonde hair, but all I can be sure of is that I was instantly drawn to her.

Our first encounter was in the second week of the new semester, when unseasonable Autumn showers over the previous few days had unsettled the auburn leaves, causing them to fall earlier than normal. The clouds remained, hanging above as I walked across the campus to my computer science class distracted by the fact that I was late again. I was busy imagining the heart crushing awkwardness of walking into a packed lecture theater late, of trying to open the door ever so gently so as to sneak in unnoticed, and of the neglected hinge inevitably letting out a tremendous sound which would echo around the hall, seemingly amplified by the slowness of my pushing. I was picturing the look of piercing resentment in the eyes of my peers that said “we all made it here on time, so why couldn’t you?”, and the kind look of sadness in the wrinkles of the professor’s face that merely revealed what little hope he had for me this year. I was so busy picturing all this, that I didn’t notice the wooden bench that I was about to walk into.

“Dammit,” I threw the bench an accusing look as I slipped into the wet, leaf carpeted ground.

“Ha!” A female laugh came from behind me. “Yeah, you gotta watch out for those benches,” she said, wiping her hair from her face to reveal her smile. She had a slight overbite, but it was framed by lips so full and soft I was sure I recognised them from a gum commercial. She offered me her hand to help me up and I could see her face clearly.

I must have been staring then because she asked if I was okay, if I had concussion, and I wanted to tell her that yes, I was okay, more than okay, that I was in fact knocked out by her beauty, but this wasn’t a movie and such lines don’t sound as smooth in real life. I needed an answer, a witty yet breezy line to keep the conversation flowing with this girl whose life I had just stumbled into.

“bjrrrrrr” was what I went with.
“I’m sorry?”
“bjrrrrrrr!” I clarified. Maybe I was concussed, I couldn’t find my words. My head felt light so I sat down on the bench.
“Fuck, I forgot this happens, wear your gloves Lily, idiot,” I swore I heard her say to herself. She replaced her smile with a grimace as the air felt light and my head became heavy. I must have fallen and passed out at this point because when I woke up the sun illuminated the sky and the leaves felt crisp beneath me, rustling as I steadied myself.

Long story short, and we laugh about it now of course, but it turns out that when one of her race touches human skin for the first time, the invisible bacteria that coats their bodies causes almost instant death in 90% of cases. Her body has gradually acclimated to Earth now so it doesn’t happen anymore. At that time though, she passed it off as just a concussion. So actually I was extremely fortunate to survive, she literally nearly killed my the first time we met. But like I said, we laugh about it now.


The first time that I thought something was really up was when Lily tried to eat my neighbor's 2 year old daughter. Wait, that sounds really bad when I put it down without context. The baby was upset and crying loudly, and Lily wanted to stop it crying so she tried to ingest it. Actually, that doesn’t clear things up at all does it? Allow me to explain.

What happened was, Lily was staying over at my place on our 3rd or 4th date and we were naturally pretty excited that we were about to take our relationship to the next level. The thing was, that the neighbor’s niece was an utter brat who’d run around their house screaming hour after hour, day and night. The neighbor often went out on errands for hours at a time leaving the child to annoy the whole apartment block. So this particular night I was getting especially tetchy about the kid ruining the romantic mood that I’d hoped to create. I had strategically placed candles around my room, put on some jazz radio station that I’d never listened to before. I had really gone all out, you see. We tried to ignore it, drinking more and more red wine. There was a few minutes of blissful silence, but the sound soon started again louder than before.

“Oh. My. God,” I said, digging my hands into the arms of the sofa.
“Leave it to me,” Lily said, with a wink and wave of the hand. “Where I’m from, we have a trick for dealing with this.”

She let herself out, as I went to my bathroom. I breathed in and let out a huge sigh, feeling tired. I went to the mirror and slapped my face a few times to try to wake myself up. I then practiced making alluring sexy faces for what must have been a good 10 minutes, even throwing in a few animalistic growls too. At this point I realised I was quite drunk. I also noticed that Lily still hadn’t come back yet so I went next door to find her, wondering if she’d gotten lost. I approached the door and a slither of light was leaking out, projecting a triangle into the hallway.

“Lily?” I carefully opened the door. She was kneeling on the floor bending over the child, who I couldn’t see because of the shadow. She hadn’t noticed me entering but she shuffled a little to the side, and I saw her kissing the child’s cheek. That’s sweet, I thought and the child wasn’t screaming anymore. She carried on softly kissing the childs face, and the kiss became a lick. That’s...not normal, I thought but the child had calmed down so I guessed it was okay. She continued doing this and I realised that I must have been drunker than I thought because my eyes seemed to start playing tricks on me and I could have swore I saw Lily’s jaw detach, and her mouth start to envelop the child’s head.

“Lily!” She turned around fully, the baby’s legs dangling out her mouth. Lily’s eyes widened and she spat the baby out with a panicked exhale of breath. She shook her and casually strolled over to me with a warm smile and touched my arm. 
“Everything okay? I was just putting him to sleep.” She touched my arm again. “Let’s get back to your place.”
“What...” I looked over the the sleeping child and motioned at it with my arm. “The hell was that?”
“Shh, it’s nothing,” she said with a shake a the head and those lips pouting as she put her forefinger in front of then. “You’re a little drunk, I dont’ know what you think you saw, but let’s go back and relax.”

I gave my own head a shake and conceded that I was a little drunk and soon we were back in my apartment and asleep next to each other on my couch. 

She recently explained to me that actually on her planet, their saliva has a tranquillising effect on the young, and ingesting babies is something that parents often do to calm hyperactive or unruly kids. We laugh about it now.


The time when I really knew that Lily was an alien was also the day that I realised I loved her. It was about 6 months since we met, and stray items of her clothing were gathering at my apartment. A stray hair band had been joined by an errant cardigan, and a family of t-shirts soon moved in too. The winter sun through my window had woken us up early. I always invited her to stay at mine after class on Thursdays to “go over our notes”, but the truth is that I mostly just liked the way she looked in the mornings before she put her makeup on, before she brushed her hair. I liked this secret version of her that only I got to see.

We decided to skip class that morning. Professor Stein’s class on numerical analysis had comprehensively lost out to Lily’s suggestion of driving out into the fields and having a picnic by the creek just out of town. On the highway north the numbers of other vehicles gradually diminished and after a few minutes our’s the only car on the road.

I guess my driving must’ve gone into autopilot when it happened. I never was the most attentive driver, or the most attentive person in general. I remember that I noticed the road was getting darker, and clouds were now rolling across the sky. My memory of this part is a little hazy, but I guess I leaned forward to get a better view of the sky to check the weather. I must’ve been thinking about whether the rain would ruin our picnic plans, so my eyes followed the clouds instead of the road and although I can’t remember the crash itself, I’ll never forget what Lily did next.

My body was lying next to the upturned car. I could see the blood seeping through my shirt, and my blood shot eyes as the cars engine emitted a sigh of steam. The way I remember this is from above, but whether I was having actual out of body experience or it was my damaged brain and its confused panicking neurons and synapses playing tricks or merely filling in the gaps in my memory, I guess I’ll never know. I remember Lily kneeling beside me and wiping her hair from her face again, her overbite now framed by lips pursed in concentration as she moved her hands up and down my chest creating a strange heat that made my lungs gasp and my chest constrict. Her hands were glowing, sparkling, and she pressed harder onto my body and I heard a sound like TV static, which was coming from Lily, not the still steaming floor of the car. I felt myself now dragged back into my body and with a draw of blood filled air my eyes met Lily’s again.

“I love you,” she silently mouthed the first of these words, and regained her voice. “I guess you know I’m not from around here now.”
“I guess,” I tried to smile but it turned into a wince from the pain.
“It’ll be alright,” she gently moved her hands over my chest again. “My parents would kill me if they found out anyone knew I was an alien.”
“I won’t tell anyone.”

So now I realise my girlfriend is an alien. We have our ups and downs, but we love each other and we're trying to make it work. ",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1367048035.0,,,True,t3_1d7fxy,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1d7fxy/critique_my_girlfriend_is_an_alien_black_comedy/,

&gt;The house smells the same.   I find myself inside, just in front of the door.  I don’t remember entering… The fireplace looks the same.  The wooden mantle just as worn and filled with the tiny holes created by an absence of the rusted nails that used to fill them.  Pap once told me it was made from barn wood.  The bell is still there, right in the middle of the mantle where it always sat among the odd trinkets they had gathered over the years.  He used to pick me up so I could ring it.  It’s smaller than I remember, but someone polished it.  

&gt;I hear the telltale clearing of his throat that lets me know he is at the table again.  I make my way past the patio door.  It’s snowing.  The place where we buried Garfield has flowers blooming on top.  It must be spring.  I hear Pap turn the page of his paper.  I turn to see smoke rising from his cigarette.  It pools and ripples on the ceiling above him.  

&gt;I walk past him and towards the window where Nan used to watch the cardinals.  The window is hot and the sun is bright.  It must be summer.  There are no cardinals.  Nan is never there.  The owl is back.  His eyes are wide and his coat is pure white.  He stares intently through the window at me, but never for more than a few minutes at a time…or is it hours?  

&gt;I take my seat next to Pap.  He continues to read his paper, turning an impossible number of pages.  His cigarette smells like old leather and citrus.  We only ever sit in silence.  I want to talk to him, but when I try, I’m stopped by a forgotten thing.  I stare at the space in front of his paper.  Sometimes I catch him glance at me out of the corner of my eye.  It’s just a quick glance; a small acknowledgement that I am more than the silence that surrounds him.  The moment passes quickly, and so the silence remains.  

&gt;Often I will just sit in the silence with Pap.  Once I explored the house.  I found an impossible second floor, a window that thought it was a door, a closet too shallow for coats and a coat with endless pockets.  In the den, it was autumn and in the bedroom there was a rainbow.   One staircase was only made for going up and the other would let you go down if you asked it nicely.  

&gt;These things never hold my interest for long.  I always come back to Pap.  We sit.  He reads.  I try.  I forget. 

&gt;I know that when the cigarette is burned through, the dream will be over.  No act buys me more time.  When the cigarette is burned through, Pap will get up.  He will go down the up staircase and go up the down without asking.  I cannot follow.

Jennifer Forever:

You never forget your first port. The pain that shoots through your head. The almost blinding light that flashes from behind your eyes. The way the sky seems to open up into a whirlpool of clouds, swirling simultaneously clockwise and counter clockwise, rising to a crescendo of grey, before closing with a clap of dull thunder. The way the blood drips from your nose. The way the world never quite seems the same afterwards. Yeah, you never forget your first port.

Here is the story of mine.



May 10th 2014.

“Did you see this?” Jennifer asked, pointing at the screen of her cellphone.

“What is it?” I squinted to see the screen.

“Here, take a look...” She double tapped the screen, expanding a youtube video, its view counter showing zero.

“What am I supposed to be looking at?” My eyes still squinting, my lips pursed in concentration at the screen.

“Just watch it, will you?”

The video opens with a kid running, camera facing the ground, capturing his feet as he raced across a field, his sneakers becoming muddied, occasionally remembering to point the camera upwards towards a collection of thin trees he was moving towards. I can hear a male and a female voice off camera.

“Some kids screwing around in a field, how exciting. Has it gone viral yet?” I said.

“Just keep watching” She tapped my arm, nodding to the screen.

The kids make it to the trees. The kid holding the camera pans around a bit to take in his friends, before flashing his own freckled smile at the lens. There are three of them in total, two guys, maybe 17, 18, and a blue eyed blonde girl the same age. It seems like it was getting dark wherever this was, but there is a blue glow coming from a clearing just past the trees, lighting the surroundings.

“The hell is that?” My eyes widened.

“Keep. Watching.” Jennifer tapped my arm, a little harder than before.

There kids are saying something in voices that sound animated, but I cant make out what.

“You know, this kinda looks like that place behind Noahs house. That forest where you guys used to go after school and...HEY!” Jennifer now punched my arm.

“I think it is. The cows and sheep aren't there, but yeah, it looks like the same place. Okay. Any...second...now...” she motioned towards the screen again.

A light shoots up from the trees. A bang like the sound of trees falling. The camera drops to the ground, facing the now dark sky, whose peacefulness is now punctured by the sound of heavy breathing off camera. A minute or so passes. An older woman picks up the camera, her face bloodied and her blue eyes wide and vacant as she admires the lens for a moment. The wind blows blonde hair across her face.

“Im sorry” the woman says. Dropping the camera to the ground, turning the display to static.

“Who posted this? Some kind of student horror movie or something? Viral marketing for an insurance company or some crap like that? Fuck it, lets check it again.” I pressed the ""replay"" button, only to be informed ""sorry, the content you are looking for has been deleted.""

“What happened here?” I asked, as much to myself, as to Jennifer, as to the woman who eyes I had just met. I leaned back in my chair. I realised my mouth was wide open as I thought about what we'd just watched. I leaned forward again, refreshing the page. The same message appeared. ""sorry, the content you are looking for has been deleted.""

“Im sorry”. These words, the dull hoarseness to her voice, repeating in my head. I realised I'd been staring beyond the screen for a minute or two by now.


“Say, do you have your car?” I asked, turning to Jennifer, who was already grabbing her coat from her chair.



It was a short drive. Without checking the car navigation, Jennifer took us towards the place we thought we recognised from the video, the place she had recognised from years ago. We drove mostly in silence as I searched youtube with my own cell phone for the video. Nothing. I tried Google. ""viral video woods minnesota"". A few hits, nothing relevant. ""Blue light minnesota forest May”. Same results. I sighed and I looked over to Jennifer and watched her eyes narrowed in focus on the night road searching for possible obstructions. I thought about how the nights in Minnesota always seemed somehow darker than any other place in America, yet how the moonlight seemed so much brighter. I watched her hands gripped on the steering wheel tightly. I saw the cassette tape I had given her, my scrawled in crayon on it, still laying on her dashboard, sliding with the camber of the country roads. Jennifers beat up car instinctively came to a jerky stop just by a large wooden house. Its exterior was a now a faded grey color, neglected paint chipping away.

“Its been a while since I came here” she ran her fingers through her hair.

“You ever still think about that asshole?” I asked.

“Who?”

“Noah.”

“Who?”

I got out of the car. Jennifer followed. As we moved around the outside of the empty house, towards the field we'd seen in the video..

“He and his family moved away so quickly, huh?” I said, as Jennifer carried on walking, now almost running as we headed towards the trees. “Pretty cold of him to just leave without mentioning anything to you. His family too.”

“Look, do you wanna find out what happened with that video? Or do you just wanna drag up my old love life?” She said. “Look, over there. It looks the same as the trees in the video. I knew I recognised it.”


As we got closer, our brisk walk instinctively slowed. Our eyes and heads were scanning the area, looking for clues. I stumbled in the unkempt grass, where Noahs animals used to graze. Something was illuminating the inside of the woods. At first it seemed like just the moonlights reflection, or just the torch of a dog walker. Our feet trampling through the long grass, stumbling as we went, it became clearly a shade of blue, rising in an uncanny sphere from the trees now directly in front of us. The tall trees, silhouetted against the growing, pulsing blue now engulfing us both. A sound like white noise came from behind us, making us instinctively turn around, and the light was now 360 degrees. Jennifer grabbed my wrist tightly, and I turned to watch her, her bloodied mouth half open, as we fell in each others arms, into the ground, into the light.

----------------


Gussie was a poor girl. She had rough hands, broken fingernails, and a dirty face. Quiet and ugly, no one gave her any thought. Morning and evening was spent working side by side with her brothers and sisters on the pitiful patch of dirt her father called a farm. Her mother had been mute and dumb since her illness ten years back, and her frequently inebriated father had no time for “malarkey” from any of his children. Gussie had no one then.

Gussie had gone to school once.  She thought the one room school house was beautiful compared to the pathetic shack at home. Where Gussie lived, there were smelly oil cloth windows and cracks between the logs where bugs and cold came in. Gussie stared at the real glass windows with her mouth agape. The only glass she’d ever seen was a shattered piece of a mirror that had once belonged to her mother. She found that she did not have a seatmate, but that was no matter to Gussie. Happy to sit alone at her very own desk, she smiled broadly as each clean, freshly scrubbed face stared back at her with a mixture of contempt and interest.  Gussie wanted a friend. 

The teacher was kind enough to Gussie. She handed her a slate and took her name down in the book. Gussie had never seen anyone write anything before. She watched as teacher dipped the sleek black pen into the ink, and more than ever Gussie wanted to grab it out of her hand and scribble all over the page. 

At recess, Gussie removed her biscuit from her ragged handkerchief and slowly ate while watching the other children play. She was approached by a girl with soft blonde curls and blue eyes. Gussie noticed that the girl had a bright blue bow in her hair. It looked so soft that Gussie had to stop herself from reaching out to touch it. 

“I’m Martha, wanna play a game?” Gussie was so excited that she couldn’t even speak. She could only nod a dumb affirmation. 

“You stand there. Hold his hand,” Martha said, pointing toward a boy that was two times the size of Gussie. All the children lined up in a line with smirks on their faces.

 “Just hold on! It’ll be fun!” Gussie stood still and held the boy’s hand. Suddenly Gussie was whipped across the lawn, barely missing a low hanging branch and falling violently to the ground.

 “Stupid, the point of the game is to hold on!” Martha yelled. “Haven’t you ever played ‘crack the whip’ before? You didn’t even make it through the first turn! You must be in even worse shape than you look! You’re worthless!”

All the children laughed at pitiful Gussie. The tears in her clothes were now even worse than when she had arrived, and her hair was pulled out of its braid. Gussie got up and ran. It seemed like the laughter followed her all the way home. She went to her mother, but her mother just stared at her with her those almost dead eyes. Would no one give Gussie comfort? 

Gussie slinked silently away and hid in the root cellar until her brothers and sisters returned from the field.

 “We told you not to go, Gussie. There’s nothing to book learning, just a passel of trouble. What do you need it for, anyway? We’ll not use it.” Gussie hung her head in shame. She wanted too many things.
Gussie spent the following months working in the fields with her brothers and sisters. Things were empty then. Nothing ever changed. Father stayed drunk and only communicated with his children in moans and grunts. Mother stared out the window all day, the clouds reflected in her soulless eyes.  Gussie was largely ignored by the rest of the brood.

In the afternoon when it was too hot to work, Gussie would wander aimlessly. She would walk to the stream and watch the neighbor’s horse eat grass across the way, slink through the apple orchard on the farm behind their shanty, or take the path towards the big Decatur road to watch people coming from town.  

One hot Thursday afternoon when everyone had drank their fill from the stream and fallen asleep under a shade tree, Gussie took off for the Decatur road. She saw the heat waves rising from the dirt in the distance, and had to shade her eyes from the glaring sun. She saw no one on the road. 

Vultures circled to the east over some recently departed animal. Gussie watched them circle with and thought of the school children.  She wanted to kill those birds. She wanted to rip them out of the sky with her hands and bang their heads together until she saw blood. 

Suddenly a man appeared on a horse in the distance. As he approached, Gussie hesitantly looked in his face to see if she knew him. He had blonde hair and blue eyes. Around his smart looking straw hat was a blue band. Gussie gasped; it was the same color band that had been in Martha’s hair. She longed again to reach out and touch it, but this time she squashed the thought immediately. She hated blue now. 

“How do you do?” the man said, smiling into her face. 

Gussie froze. She had never talked to a grown man other than her father. She bowed her head and stared silently at her feet. 

“Come now, I know you can talk.” he said. Gussie tried to shrink into the ground.

 “That’s ok. I’m looking for the Tidwell place. You know of it?” Gussie started and looked at the man. That was her house. She had never seen this man before. He looked nothing like her father. Father had a brother, or so he had said when he was not liquored up. Could this be him? 

“I’m no kin, just have business with him.” Gussie started again. Had she spoken aloud?

Gussie shook her head and pointed in the direction of her house, just visible on the horizon. 

“Good afternoon,” said the man, tapping his horse with his whip. Gussie again tried to disappear. 

Gussie stood looking at her feet for several minutes, dragging her toe through the dirt and making a lopsided line.  When her interest was too much to bear, she slowly raised her head and watched the man as he headed off towards her house. She began to follow slowly, stopping every few feet in hesitation, staring all the time at the blue hatband. She started to follow more quickly as the horse began to trot. When the horse got too far away for her to see the blue hat band, she began to run. 

By the time she got to the house, the man was already seated at the rickety kitchen table. Her father was shaking his head in dismay and horror. He continued for several minutes, his eyes searching the man’s eyes. “No!” he finally screamed. “You lied! You didn’t hold up your end of the bargain! You didn’t hold up your end of the bargain!” Gussie’s father was more sober than he’d been for as long as Gussie could remember.

“You can’t take them because you lied. She wasn’t right! She’s never been right. You made a promise that you couldn’t keep. You didn’t keep it!” 

“You made a deal with me, sir, fair and square” said the man. “What did you expect? Did you think I wouldn’t come back for them? You wanted her ‘alive, no matter what,’ I think were your words, if you need reminding. You made a deal. Your wife for your children when the time came.  The time has come for me to collect.”

The man took his hat off and looked at Gussie. He slowly pulled the blue felt off and stretched his hand out towards Gussie. “Come, child,” he said. “Take it. I know your mind. Take it.” 

Gussie slowly inched forward, hand reaching for the blue. All she wanted to do was touch it, and then she would retreat. 

“Come, girl, it’s yours,” the man said. 

Gussie grabbed the blue ribbon, lovingly fingering the soft nap of the fabric as she quickly backed away. This man was nice. Gussie had no one. Gussie wanted a friend. Gussie slowly looked into the man’s face and attempted a smile.

“And she will be my favorite,” the Devil said.

She woke in pain.
 
Her lungs burned, her skin felt stretched too tight and raw all over. When she opened her mouth, Aderyn found that her throat was thick and swollen. She gasped for air and found that it came raggedly but at least it came.
 
I’m alive, she thought. Why?
 
Opening her eyes was difficult. They were crusted over with a film that refused to crack, but when she tried to raise her fingers to wipe at them, she found that they were bound. What? Why… I don’t…
 
“You’re awake,” a voice said above her. She didn’t recognize it but it was male and sounded friendly. “Stay still, I’ll get something to help.”
 
Aderyn was left alone in her darkness and quiet for a time until a warm, wet cloth was pressed against her eyes. She felt the film soften and break as the cloth was moved to wet her cheeks, forehead and lips. When she opened her eyes, a boy was standing over her. She couldn’t make out his face, her vision was still too blurry, but already she knew that he was a stranger to her. No one she knew spoke with that accent.
 
A Groundling, she thought. Have I been taken to a lower noble’s home?
 
“Don’t try and move,” he said and pressed a hand against her shoulder, gently but firmly. “We have you bound. You had seizures and we had to restrain you. We’ve seen it before, a reaction to the air.”
 
“Yes,” she said but her voice was barely understandable. It came out as a croak and the boy disappeared again for a moment, then returned to hold a bottle to her lips. A cool liquid came to them and she drank with abandon. Her thirst came raw and angry, demanding to be satiated. He pulled the bottle from her after a moment and she growled.
 
“Not so much,” he said with a chuckle. “You’ll get sick again.”
 
“Wh-where?” she managed to say, her mind going through the minor Querran Houses. Revnari would be the closest to where they’d had the War. She must be in Lord Revnari’s keep.
 
“You’re safe now,” he said. “Don’t worry. They can’t hurt you anymore.”
 
“Can’t… can’t hurt me,” she said, feeling confused. Her mother! Panic rose in her, the memories of what she’d done came flooding back like an angry river. The slap. Running out of the Viewing Platform. Her mother’s terrible visage. The Queen!
 
She panicked and began to fight her bonds. I have to get out of here, Revnari will turn me over! I have to run! It was no use, the more she struggled, the tighter the bonds seemed to get. Then she felt something cold press against her arm and just as her vision began to clear, it faded to black again.
 
When next she woke, her eyes opened easier. She was laying on something soft as well, a bed, and her hands came easily to her face. With a groan, Aderyn sat up and wiped her eyes until they focused and she could take in her surroundings.
 
And froze.
 
This was no Lord’s keep. No minor lord slept in prefab rooms, with their completely square, featureless walls and simple, mechanical doors. The only light in the room came from a flickering lantern by the only door. It was lit by flame and not ether. She was in a Groundling habitat, a slave’s quarters perhaps.
 
What happened? She thought about it as she slipped her legs from the thin sheets that covered her and put her feet on the floor. She was no longer wearing her dress, but a thin jumpsuit like the Groundlings wore. Her feet were bare and the floor was cold. She found it hard to stand, her legs wobbly and unsure and she steadied herself by reaching out a hand to the metal wall.
 
For a time, she simply stood there, unable to move. Then, exhausted, she sat back on the bed. It was a simple thing, just a foam mattress on a metal box frame. She’d seen a Groundling habitat only once, when Ian had taken her into his family’s farms. Those habitats were warmer than this, with ether lighting and glow panels on the walls. If he was in one now, their Lord did not care for them as Ian’s family did.
 
A bottle was left on the floor next to her bed. She picked it up, opened the cap and sniffed at it. At once she became aware of the smells around her. Her own sweat mixed with the metal of the walls, and a multitude of other smells she couldn’t recognize. She could only describe it as unclean.
 
She had to get out of here. If she was in Revnari’s habitats then it wouldn’t be long before she was discovered and returned to her mother. She set the bottle down, unsure if it was safe to drink, and rose determined to get out of this place.
 
This time her legs held enough that she made it halfway to the door. There she stopped and sank to her knees, needing a brief rest. How am I going to get anywhere like this? And where will I go? She didn’t have any answers to those questions but she couldn’t sit around and wait, so she forced herself to stand and walk to the door.
 
It had no release, no touch panel that would slide it aside. When Ian took her to the habitats, sometimes they had mechanical levers but this door lacked even that. She tentatively pushed on it, but found the door did not move. Frustrated she pushed harder and harder until she slipped to the ground again, exhausted.
 
Tears formed in her eyes. Useless, I’m so useless! I can’t even open a door! She drew her knees to her chest and buried her face in them, suddenly wishing the War had killed her. It would be easier, easier for her and easier for her mother. 

She probably thinks I’m dead anyway.

For a long moment, no one spoke. Sir Loran simply looked patient and awaited orders. Outside, Aderyn could see ships moving in on the moon. Destroyers and her father's Carrier had taken up a perimeter around the moon as if for bombardment. Finally, her mother sighed. “Very well Sir Loran, best bring us in.”

Aderyn found Zennir beautiful. Small seas brushed up against high-rising mountains. Those mountains swept down into lush, green valleys and plains dotted with Groundling settlements. She saw strange beasts that moved on four legs as they flew low across the landscape. The sky was red with the gas giant Querra looming overhead. Its rings cast rainbows of light down across the waters and shimmered through low hanging clouds. Aderyn had never seen anything like it.

The battlefield was a valley nestled between two of the small mountain peaks. For miles only cultivated farmland was to be seen. Churned soil replaced green grass and her mother wrinkled her nose at the sight. “Not very pretty,” her lady mother said and turned away again. Aderyn had wanted to tell her that planting season must be soon but feared what that knowledge would cost her. She hates that I know so much of the Groundling ways.

The yacht settled a few hundred yards from the battlefield and nestled itself between two large hills. The viewing stand was already filling up with ladies in their finery. A few lords who were too old, too young, or not involved in the war were there as well. She thought she saw the azure and jade of Nevan among them, but the distance made it hard. 

Her mother rose and she followed her to the airlock, where they fitted ornate Ether-powered masks over their heads. Her mother's lit up when she touched it, the impervaglass fixture glowing with deep white Ether. Aderyn's did not turn on until she had fixed it to the battery on her hair lock. She almost wished she could rip it off and taste the heady smells of the planet, but it would never do. Groundling air was full of toxins and no noble lady would dare breath it in. The last time Aderyn had let herself, she'd been sick for a month.

As they walked across the short expanse of grass, Aderyn reveled in the soft, pliable feel of it beneath her shoes. Idly she wondered what it would feel like beneath her bare feet. Ian had taken her down to Hyperia's beaches once and they had walked with sand and water caressing their toes. That experience had taken the breath from her. At just twelve, she had been in love with the planet and with the young boy who had shown it to her.

But Ian has no use for a Null. The thought made her mood sour as they approached the viewing stand's ramp. She followed her mother up and into the airlock, where they removed their masks and breathed clean, treated air again. 

Nearly a hundred noblemen and ladies gathered within. Serving bots hovered about, serving wine and finger foods. Aderyn took a passing roll and let it dissolve on her tongue. Her mother gave her a scornful look but Aderyn pretended not to see. One roll would not make her dresses snug. Nor two. Or three. What would it matter if it did anyway? It was her lack of a Spark that made her unattractive.

The viewing stand was simple as such things went. Vaguely rectangular it had a large amphitheater where the nobles would sit and watch the war. Behind that were tables and chairs and viewscreens where they could sit with one another and talk, serving droids bringing them food and drinks. To either side were private rooms and bathrooms. Aderyn eyed one of the private rooms, seeing it locked already. It made her flush to think what was going on within. “War gets one's blood hot,” her brother Redrick had told her often enough. 

They went first to the tables but did not sit. Her mother glared at her when she took a bite-sized sandwich and a glass of wine. Aderyn merely shrugged. If she was going to sit through this, she would do so on a full stomach. 
	
“Must you eat so much?” her mother hissed, leading them towards the other end of the sitting area. “We are here to watch a war and you are here to impress Lord Rhyen's son Duwen, should the boy show himself.” Her mother sniffed and glanced around. Aderyn kept her eyes downcast. “I swear, if you get sick? I'll see you switched myself.”
	
And then a tall, flame-haired woman was there. Her mother visibly paled and dropped into a curtsy so grand that Aderyn stood stunned. Then she saw her, really saw her. Her body went rigid, her eyes unable to take themselves off the blue-white circlet of ether that encircled her head. She’d seen a likeness of her only once, an ether-image her father brought home once from Court.
	
“My Queen,” she gasped and all bet fell to her knees. Instantly she regretted even speaking to the woman. She was a Null-blood, a nothing and this woman was… she was the most powerful Blood in the galaxy aside from the King himself. 
	
“Oh Lyana, do stand,” the Queen said, her voice sounding like it was on the edge of delightful laughter. Aderyn both loved and coveted it at once. It made her feel at ease, calm, despite her panic. Still, she kept her eyes on the floor.
	
“Your Majesty,” her mother said and Aderyn heard her skirts rustle as she stood. “This is an unexpected pleasure.”
	
“Please, the palace is secluded and boring, you know how much I hate that kind of thing. Is that your daughter?”
	
“Of course, my queen, I… er, yes. Your Majesty, this is Aderyn. Do stand up child.”
	
Aderyn stood on shaking knees, smoothing her skirts and doing her best not to meet the Queen’s eyes. She kept them turned down and away without avoiding looking at her entirely. Then she felt warm fingers on her chin, turning her head back and upward.

Their eyes met.

Green, she thought. Like mine. The Queen kept her hand on Aderyn’s chin for the length of that moment, the grip firm but gentle. There was something behind those eyes, beyond the kind smile on her pale pink lips. It was sadness.

“I’m sorry, Lyana,” the Queen whispered.

Her mother did not reply and the Queen released Aderyn’s chin. She stood, stunned and unable to think. What had just happened? Why did the Queen – the Queen! – speak to her mother like they knew one another? She’d never heard her mother say a word about the Queen in all her life.

“We should speak,” the Queen said and touched her mother on the arm. “Come.” Her mother did not give Aderyn a single glance as they walked through the crowd. Noblemen and women gave them wide birth, parting for them. Aderyn snatched a wine glass from a passing robo-server and downed it.

They left the Starkeep aboard their family’s star yacht, the Resilience. As large as a small cruiser, it crewed nearly a hundred men, most of them of lower nobility. There were no Groundlings serving House Medani, a sign of their power. As Aderyn stared into the red liquid of her drink, she thought they could do with some Groundling help.

Their House was small and too many of her cousins were being pushed into duties that were beneath them. She had been served the wine by Jevrey Cannith, her mother’s nephew. House Cannith was poor, but surely they could do more than have one its Heirs serve wine?

She set it down and looked out the viewport, watching as the Starkeep slid away from them. It seemed to fall into the beyond, glinting as the light of the stars caught its metallic spires and battlements. Several Chariots flew past the yacht, knights flying as escort. The small, triangular craft were so fast and maneuverable that Aderyn imagined they were a thrill to fly.

Not that I could fly one without a Spark. The thought soured her mood even more and she turned back to look at her mother. Lyana Medani sat rigid and placid. She spoke to her cousin too quietly for her to hear. Then Jevrey left in quite the hurry. She’s sent him to get her a cushion no doubt. A Medani must be comfortable, especially one like her mother.

“Stop slouching,” Lyana snapped at her. She hadn’t even turned her eyes to look at her. “Sit up for ancestor’s sake. Your cousin was here. He’ll talk.”

Aderyn sat and hoped she could avoid any more discussion until they were through the Jump Gate. It loomed in the distance, gigantic and crescent shaped. Blue and silver it shone in the darkness like a waxing, metal moon. Soon it would spark to life, Ether swirling and roiling as the portal to subspace opened. Even as she watched, it began.

Aderyn had only been planet side once during a lightning storm, but it had reminded her of a Jump Gate opening. Flashes of light, white and blue and green flickered from the center to the inner edges of the Gate. It then expanded into shimmering clouds of crimson and gold and azure before draining into a whirlpool of silver and white. There was no sound in space of course, but Aderyn always imagined that the Gate roared.

Subspace, she thought as the yacht approached. Ether comes from there. If I could just reach out and touch it, just once, would I Spark? With a jolt, the yacht touched the edge of the Gate portal and for the blink of an eye, time stood still. Her heart skipped a beat. She forgot to breath. Memories shifted and what was the past became the present and future.

Her father lifted her high and she squealed, tugging on his mustaches. Her brother Redrick sat with her in his room, pointing out each of the star systems. Ian touched her cheek and said that when she Sparked, they would get married.

A snap and her mind reverted to real time and she held a hand to her forehead. I hate that. She would not cry, not in front of her mother. Not ever in front of mother.

“You best not be sick during the war,” Lyana said without looking at her. “It would not help you to be sick.”

The trip from Meda to Hyperion took just over an hour and then it was just a single, short subspace jump to Querra. Soon they were orbiting the gas giant with its many moons and multicolored rings. Already her father’s fleet was aligned with those of Hyperion. She lay her head against the viewport, wondering which of those ships Ian served on. He was the third son of Lord Jonef Hyperion, her family’s liegelord. He would be aboard a destroyer or perhaps he was a knight and flew one of the small Chariots. It had been over a year since she spoke to him.

“Come,” her mother said and she rose. Together they left the lounge and went up to the observation deck. From there they could see much more. Aderyn could see all of Querra as it hung there, each ring a different shade of red. “Which moon will the war be on, mother?” she asked, trying to sound eager.

“Zennir,” her mother told her and held out her hand. Ether flashed onto her wrist device and a projection of the planet appeared. Her mother’s fingers twitched and the moon, one like every other, enlarged. “A pleasant moon, for atmosphere.”

“A good place for a war, mother?”

Her mother eyed her and then smirked. “Good as any, though I don’t know why they insist on making it in atmosphere. The air is not purified and there is… dirt.”

“I rather liked the wind when we went to Persephone.”

Her mother speared her with an iron gray gaze. “None of that kind of talk with the Nevans.” Her mother turned away, sparing Aderyn from having her see how pink her cheeks had become. “Sir Loran?”

A young man in House uniform came to stand before them. On his left breast was the sigil of the house, Moon and Sword glowing with the power of his Spark. He would have been handsome if his nose hadn’t been so large and his chin cleft not so noticeable. Still, he would be a better match than she deserved. Not that I could have even that much. As a distant relative, his power within the House was low but hers was even lower.

“Ma’am?” the knight said, bowing.

“Has the Nevan Host arrived?”

“They have, and Lord Rhyen bid me tell you that his son is most happy to share this spectacle with you and your daughter.”

Did anyone tell him her daughter is a Null? Aderyn felt her cheeks burn again, but she kept her expression cool. Her mother’s face took on a slightly confused cast and Aderyn wondered what had gone amiss.

“His son? Will Lord Rhyen not be joining us?”

“He will not it seems. Detained on House business he said, though he did not say what business that was.”

Aderyn felt her heart twist in fear. Having to impress her mother on any normal day would be hard but now she was feeling slighted. She had no hope in that regard.

http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/17bgfr/short_story_introductionfirst_paragraph/
_______

The morning air was cool and fresh in Elderwood, and I inhaled pleasantly as I walked outside to the busy street. A slight breeze blew over me, prompting me to button up my heavy green jacket as I waited for Akre to pull the cart around to the front of Elderwood’s government building. Three guardsmen shuffled in nervously behind me. I glanced at them momentarily before turning around. It’s not everyday that a rookie guard goes on a mission with the town’s steward. I shrugged my shoulders a bit, trying to look loose and relaxed. Hopefully they would do the same, it wouldn’t do good for them to be uptight and distracted around me.

I was staring at the statue in the courtyard when Akre pulled around in a cloth topped wagon. I eyed him questioningly as the guardsmen hurried into the back of the vehicle.
“So we don’t attract attention,” he said without hesitation.
I snorted indifferently and hoisted myself into the front seat beside him. With a crack of a whip we were off, heading down the busy streets of Elderwood.
“She lives on the eastern side,” Akre explained. “It’ll only take a few minutes to get there. She’s noble, too, so she has money. Her estate isn’t large, but it is guarded. So we can expect a bit of a fight.” The wagon bounced roughly on the cobblestone road. Akre slowed the horse’s pace a bit just as another bump assaulted the cart’s wheels.
“Of course,” he continued, “After that we have the mage to deal with.”
The cool air assaulted my face, so I pulled my collar up higher on my neck. The shiver that followed had nothing to do with the cold.

We all jumped off as soon as the wagon pulled up to Estate Mysse. Akre was right, it wasn’t overly lavish, but it was obvious it wasn’t cheaply made either. It was certainly a story higher than the surrounding town homes. I shrugged my bow around and held it in front of me lightly. Akre stood beside me, eyeing the building with suspicion.
“We’ll have to go in through the front. There’s no back door, at least according to the floor plan.”
I nodded and followed his lead up to the large oak door. Akre nodded at one of the guardsmen, and they hurried up to the front of the small group. A silent few seconds passed as the man readied himself to kick the door in, and with a loud crash wooden boards gave way to the dark interior of the house.

Shouts echoed and steel clanged as the home’s own guards faced off with the city guards. One of the rookies were immediately cut down, and I circled around behind everyone to get a better angle. The room was fairly large, and against the far wall sat an ornate staircase leading to the upper levels. I put an arrow to my bow and pulled, raising the head of the arrow to be level with the nearest guard’s back. One of the rookies had locked swords with him, and they stared each other down across their weapons. I pulled back on the string, tensing my back muscles, and a single breath later the arrow was loosed, flying across the room and burying itself in the man’s spine. He screamed loudly, dropping his guard, and the rookie cut him down quickly with his own sword. He grinned at me gratefully, and I offered a nod in return. Akre pulled away as the man he had been fighting alongside the other rookie fell down, bleeding and clutching his side. He stepped over towards me, surveying the scene.
“Were they expecting us?” I said.
“Seems so,” he replied. “There wasn’t a moment of surprise when we barged in.”
He cursed, glancing towards the staircase.
“We better keep moving. We still have a mage to catch.”
He motioned for one of the rookies to pull the dead guardsman outside to the wagon, and we set off up the stairs.

On our way up, I couldn’t help but notice how... normal everything was. It didn’t seem like the home of a dead-raising wizard. Everything was expensively furnished, paintings hung along the walls, the halls were lit by ornate lanterns. It was all so very normal and stereotypical of a noblewoman’s house. I pondered on this idly before a loud noise brought me back to the present. Two more guards had barged out from a door down the hallway from us. Immediately Akre and the rookie charged and engaged them. I notched another arrow in my bow and pulled back, taking aim at the farthest guard’s head. I waited a few breaths as he and the rookie circled and fought, then released as soon as I had a clear shot. The men fell back with a grunt, and a moment later Akre had the other incapacitated. We hurried forward, but I paused to step over them. I glanced at the bodies as I moved forward, and it was then when I realized something.

“Akre, these aren’t nobleman’s guards.”
The captain turned around and glanced at me, confused.
“What do you mean, they ain’t? They’re guarding a noblewoman’s home, aren’t they?”
I shook my head, motioning toward one of them.
“They aren’t wearing noble colors. Or a uniform of any kind, just regular armor. No.... these are mercenaries.”
The captain cursed, and I stared at him, perplexed.
“What do you make of it then?” He asked. His tone was strange, as if he was suspicious.
I merely shrugged my shoulders.
“Idk. That she couldn’t afford to keep full time guards? I suppose we’ll find out soon enough.”
Akre seemed satisfied at that and moved onward, stepping around a toppled vase and around the corner of the hallway. I heard a brief grunt and followed by a creaking noise, and once I had come around the corner as well I saw the source: Akre had found the door to the servant’s stairwell.
“A servant’s stairwell? In an estate this size?”
Akre snorted, and started to climb the steps two at a time. I allowed the rookie to go first, then followed.
“A servant’s staircase?” I said quietly. “Where are the servants then?”
Akre shot me a look that told me to keep quiet, then opened the door at the top. He cursed quietly, and as I came to the top landing I froze.

In the small room before up stood six mercenaries, all armed. Two of them had bows drawn and arrows notched at the ready. I felt a chill staring down the arrow shafts. A man in the center of the group spoke, talking with a distinct northern drawl.
“A’right now, that’s far enough. Don’t want any trouble with the city guard now, do we.”
Akre lowered his sword, though I kept my bow held at my side. The captain began to reply, but I interrupted him.
“What business have you here, gentleman?” The men couldn’t possibly know my rank as town steward, and their surprise at seeing the youngest of our group talk was apparent.
“What say you, boy? This is our estate, see. And far’s I can tell, you the one with no business here.”
I took stock of the men as I replied, making note of their stances and positions.
“I have plenty business here, sir. I’m on order of the city baron to arrest the lady of this house.”
Of the six men, three had shortswords and one had a dagger. Both the archers stood on the right side of the group. I took a small step to my right, making it look like a casual shifting of my weight.
“I must ask that you step aside. By standing in our way you are obstructing law and justice, and can be charged accordingly.”
The two archers relaxed a little, looking to their leader for his reply. I breathed deeply and slowly, trying to focus. I could feel Akre and the rookie growing restless beside me.
“Well, I’m ‘fraid I’ll have to disappoint,” the man sneered. He took a step forward, holding a mocking grin on his face. “There ain’t no man gunna-”
It all happened in the span of a breath. I quickly charged the archers, my own bow held out with one hand while the other grabbed an arrow from my quiver. I crashed into the two men, knocking them back and off their feet with my bow. The clash of steel rang out as I quickly spun around to stab the mercenary captain, turning the arrow around in my left hand. Akre had jumped him and locked swords with the man, allowing my arrow to find its way between the man’s shoulder blades. I didn’t wait to make sure he was dead, instead I turned back to the two archers. I drew another arrow from my quiver, and before the men could stand back up I had notched another, taken aim, and delivered it to one of the men’s chest. The other one promptly dropped his weapon and kneeled down, begging mercy. Akre and the rookie had dispatched two more mercenaries, but remained locked in combat with the last. One more arrow made short work of the man, and it was over.

“Glad we have an archer with us on this mission,” the rookie said, breathing heavily. I just shook my head.
“Don’t speak so soon. Archers are rarely good in these close-quarters situations.”
I motioned for the rookie to tie up the last guy and take him back to the wagon. Akre moved on ahead to scout up the hallway while I helped the young man. The mercenary glared at me as I tied his cuffs, but I ignored him.

Akre made a small sound, and I headed up the hall to join him. I found him standing outside a cracked door at the end, motioning inside. As I reached him, he quietly opened the door a bit more so that I could see into the room.

Mages aren’t known for being normal. Most of them live in quiet reclusion, studying their days away in cold, stone halls and castles, learning the language of the universe. A few of them sometimes make an impact on the public consciousness, becoming great heroes or terrible villains. Some of them have helped the kingdom, vanquishing armies or staying plagues and destruction from the kingdom. Small numbers of them made themselves known by being aggressors and anarchists, from murdering rich and powerful nobles to spoiling the village stew.

The room I saw before me was, like the rest of the house, a normal noblewoman’s home. A plush bed sat in the center of the room, with silken drapes circling the top of the frame. A very ornate wardrobe sat to the right of it, with a large glass window between them. On the other side of the room sat a heavy wooden desk, with two stacks of books and a pile of papers in the middle. And on that pile rested the head of a noblewoman, cradled in her arms asleep.

Within seconds, I had an arrow notched and ready, and nodded to Akre to open the door all the way. Quietly we made our way past the bed and the wardrobe to the desk. I pulled the arrow back all the way, readying myself for the confrontation, but Akre, normally bold and fierce, just stood behind me, as if unsure what to do. I sighed, and circled around to the side of the woman. It seemed she had fallen asleep working on something. Her dark hair hung freely around her face, and her dark blue robe was tied loosely at the waist. If it didn’t have the embroidered trim that Academy-issued robes have, I wouldn’t have recognized her as a mage at all.

I nudged the woman’s shoulder with my bow, feeling my muscles tense with anticipation. She was a black mage, I reminded myself, despite her appearance, and probably very dangerous. She stirred slowly, blinking her dark eyes.
“Ma’am?” I said, trying to keep the nervousness from my voice. Akre came up behind her, readying his sword in case she made any sudden moves.
“You’re under arrest, for crimes against morality and consorting with forbidden knowledge.”
Her brow furrowed in confusion. She opened her mouth to reply, but was silenced by the hilt of Akre’s sword coming down on the back of her head.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_191tc8,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/191tc8/crit_mystic_of_innocence_part_2/,

Dear Agent Name,

I am seeking representation for my horror-adventure novel, Cabin, complete at 60,000 words.


After a night of thrill-seeking, Mark, Scott, and Ryan find that they may have accidentally 
caused the downfall of humanity. They're attacked by monsters from another world, and if 
they don't close the doorway, the monsters will keep getting through. With the help of 
an old love interest, Mark and his friends each have to grow as people, through the 
strength of friendship in order to save the ones they love. But will it be enough?

I wrote several short stories before attempting this novel, but luckily this story came 
together relatively easily. I'm already working on a second standalone horror novel, and 
two or three short stories. Cabin is an expansion on a comedy-horror short story that I 
wrote last year.

If you are interested, I will gladly send you either a sample of this story, or the complete 
manuscript. Thank you very much in advance! I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Clannad is an anime based on a visual novel. Usually in visual novels, there a several female characters which you can (depending on your choices during certain speech.) have a relationship with. There is a female character named Kotomi. In the anime you can tell she has feeling for the main character/Tomoya but they never expanded upon then. So I set on the journey to write a fan fiction. 

Having saw Clannad is helpful but all you need to know about Kotomi is that she is a very smart girl who is also very socially inept (spends most of her time in the library). 

------------------------------ This is a small part --------------------------

“Kotomi!” “Hey, Kotomi” Tomoya begins to jog up the hill to try and catch up to Kotomi. “Oh, Hi Tomoya, How are you this morning?” 

""I am good thanks. Thought I might come into school on time for a change.” says Tomoya whilst rubbing his eyes.

“That is great. Once you get used to it, It isn’t really that bad” stated Kotomi. “I don’t think I could get used to this.” moaned Tomoya with a slight smile on his face. 

“So, What are you doing today?” asks Tomoya. ""Oh nothing. I will probably spend some time in the Library.""

“Say, Would you like to. uh, Have lunch together today?”

“I would love to Tomoya!” exclaimed Kotomi with a huge smile on her face.

“Great, I can’t wait.”

""Me neither...""

Tomoya slowly strolls through the classroom and collapses into his seat. “Oh hi Tomoya. I didn’t expect to see you this early.” says Ryou from across the room. 

“Well uh. I thought it would be nice to be on at least some peoples good side for a change.” “Well I think it’ great Tomoya” replies Ryou as she now stand in front of Tomoya’s desk.

“So how are you Tomoya?” “Tired, But good none the less. How about you?”  asks Tomoya. “Fine thank you. Oh here is the teacher. See ya.”

Tomoya grows more bored of his lessons by the second. Looks over to Youhei’s desk to find him sleeping on his desk. Tomoya kicks the back of his chair and with that Youhei jumps out and screams.

“AHHHHHH!” “SUNOHARA! SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP” Screamed the teacher. “Oh, Sorry Sir.” moaned Youhei with an embarrassed look on his face.

“What’s was that for man?” Asks Youhei. “What? I didn’t do anything I swear.” Lies Tomoya. Youhei slams his head back on the desk &amp; goes back to sleep.

Dinner rolls around. Tomoya heads to the cafeteria to grab some sandwiches. Once the sandwiches have been acquired, he makes his way to the library. “Hey, Tomoya!.” He turns around to find out who greeted him. Standing there with a cheesy smile on her face stands Kyou Fujibayashi. “Stop smiling like that You’re making me feel uneasy.” 

“Oh shut it you. Say, Where are you going?” asks Ryou. “Just to the library to have lunch with Kotomi.”

“Oh. Well then I’ll let you get along to your little date. Bye!” “It’s not a da-” Kyou has already ran off before he can finish his sentence. 

Tomoya slides open the door to the library and walks in. 

“Kotomi? You in here?” As Tomoya continues to walk into the Library, He spots Kotomi sitting on the ground bare foot as usual. But this time, Tomoya is dumbfounded. Tomoya just stands a stares. 

Looking at the way the light from the window hits Kotomi’s face. “Hi Tomoya!” “Tomoya?” Kotomi gets no reply. 

She stands up and walks towards him. Tomoya’s eyes follow her face. Still stuck for words, He stands as Kotomi shakes him. “Hey, Tomoya.” “Oh, What? I’m sorry. I was a little dizzy.” responds Tomoya. 

“Hey, I grabbed sandwiches.” Says Tomoya as he pulls out two sandwiches from his bag. “Oh great. I actually can’t find my lunch. But I do have some tea.” replied Kotomi as she pulls out a flask of tea. 

They both sit &amp; begin eating. “So how was your classes Tomoya?” asks Kotomi. “Ah, The usual stuff. I don’t want to bore you with it. Tell me, What have you been doing?”

“Ah, I was reading up on ‘Higgs Boson’ Do you know about it?” She asked. “I can’t say that I do Kotomi.” They continue eating until the bell that indicates classes are about to begin sounds. “Oh, I should be going.”

They both reached for the remaining packaging leftover from the sandwiches. Their hands connect. One on top of another. It feels as if time has completely stopped. 

Tomoya pulls his hand back &amp; blushes. “What’s wrong Tomoya?” asked Kotomi with a slightly concerned look on her face. “Oh nothing, I’m sorry. I’m going to go now. Hey, Wait for me here after school okay?”

“Okay, I’ll be right here Tomoya!” Kotomi begins to blush. She lowers her head in an act of shyness. ",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_xxm86,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/xxm86/i_have_recently_started_writing_again_i_feel_a/,

I would like it if someone could review my Fantasy work, thank you ^^",Cralineleader,10,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/xuauf/ive_been_a_writer_for_only_a_short_time_now_about/,"The sun's rays break through the tallest of the trees, the forest's greens and yellows coming out with the vibrant signal of life. Hummingbirds flit about the morning air, renewing the life of the delicate ecosystem.
 There is not a single patch of grass, not a sidewalk nor wall that has been enveloped in the forest's careful embrace. The ruins of signs and of cars, skyscrapers. . . All of them have been made new with the color of nature.
A light mist hangs over the trees with a gentle grasp, as if weaving between the trees like water. It's a simple place, but around every corner there is a new wonder to find, a new flower that gleams.

It seems quiet, but it feels more natural when every creature who cared for the grass, preventing overgrowth, has now been swallowed whole by the past. No matter where a weary hunter, traveler, or gatherer ventured, all that could be seen was the vegetation.
Except in the middle of the forest. But noone ever went there, as it is holy ground for the creatures.

Seemingly human, yet born into the world in such a way that they couldn't possibly be. From the seeds of their mothers, the Spirea are born as a single leaf that has been well camouflaged by the surrounding world. Over the months, they will grow, vines creeping along the ground until they form a body of human shape, a child seemingly average. However, nothing can hide their inner nature, the sunlight being moved through their veins and the most amazing eyes, the purest green like that of emeralds.

They are not cared for by their own parents, but rather grow on their own alongside others of their own idiosyncrasy. It's a mystery as to who their parents are until the day of their 15th birthday, the day when they regain the past.  All those who've left on their birthdays before, and all events surrounding them. The tiny forest clearing is riddled with huts, the children running about as if they've been raised by their own parents.

There isn't just one of these little settlings, however. They surround the forest, 5 tiny tribes living together. Wanderers, though few and far in between, may be found.. scarce and very rare, not many of them survive the attacks of their long rivaled enemies:
Mutants.
They're grotesque, freakish. None of the villages, not even any of the mysterious wanderers dare face them with intent. Grey fur, but some don't even have any as it has been ripped clean from their skin. Their many quarrels amongst themselves have weakened them, leaving only the strongest and most fearsome to rule the forest. Primitive. Their name is Lupus, beyond the size of even the largest of wolves. If the bones of the dead, the ancestors of these creatures were found, they would be able to snap the largest in two with little hesitation. Fearsome teeth glisten with the smell of rotting flesh as they break through underbrush. They don't work well together, either. The horrid nature repels even those of their own family.

 The huts made of elephant's ear leaves carefully break through the grassy clearing, and the most western of the younglings' tribes sleeps through the starry night. The milky way still remains, though fuzzy from the atmosphere's past beatings. The drifting light moves through cracks in the hut, allowing the starry light to settle upon the sleeping forms huddling against each other for warmth. They've not had one tribe member leave in a while, though that changes tonight.
The little shadow of  a 15 year old boy  moves silently through the long grass, as if walking through waves of green water. His feet are bare, calloused by the years of movement, gathering, and escaping. The tribes have never felt safe in the ruins of the buildings, their place belongs among the plants where their safety is assured. Because the old ruins are where the bodies are, or what's left of them after the Lupus have reached them.

The boy moves solemnly, his eyes a milky blue. They won't remember him by morning, as with the rest. The memories of old comrades flood back to him with every step he takes, tears dripping off his thin face. How could he have forgotten the one he called his sister, the friend who sacrificed his arm to Lupus for him to escape. But after tonight, they won't remember him either.

1339965264.0,5,self.KeepWriting,v6w3k,This is the first chapter of my work-in-progress novel. Feedback anyone?   ,jaydubsea,6,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/v6w3k/this_is_the_first_chapter_of_my_workinprogress/,"It was an ordinary morning, on an ordinary street, in a perfectly ordinary town. The sun was coming up, as it usually does at this time. The lawns, neat and tidy, glistened with dew. All was perfectly normal. The people awaking in the orderly houses with their proper gardens would not have it any other way

One such person was Harvey Matthews. Mr. Matthews was exceptionally ordinary. He was always neatly dressed; a perfectly arranged bowtie nestled at his neck. Mr. Matthews arose every morning at precisely 7:15. At precisely 7:17 Mr. Matthews allowed himself a total of four minutes to groom himself for the coming day. As he brushed his teeth with proper brushing etiquette: front to back, up and down not side to side, he glanced at his reflection in the mirror. A wrinkled face stared back at him, bushy grey eyebrows over muted blue eyes. At 7:21 am, Mr. Matthews continues downstairs to arrange breakfast. At exactly 8:05 Mr. Matthews pulls on his gray coat and places his black hat on his head. After locking all seventeen locks on his front door, Mr. Matthews sets off for the city bus stop. If the bus does not arrive by exactly 8:12 Mr. Matthews will walk into town. Mr. Matthews prides himself on being perfectly ordinary, thank you very much. To be perfectly ordinary you must have precise routine.

It was on this ordinary morning that something rather extraordinary happened. It was on this morning that for the first time in six months and thirteen days the bus arrived early at the Charles Street stop. A block away, Mr. Matthews watched as it pulled away without him. His mind reeled at the possibility of being late. He began to run and wave wildly.

Two streets away, Felix Derry blinked his eyes open. As they slowly adjusted, the cracked ceiling came into focus. Staring at the faults in the ceiling the boy tried to hold on to the last wisps of the dream he had been having. He’d been flying, soaring high above the maples that lined the drive of the orphanage, passing birds and even a plane. This was the third night in a row he’d had this dream. How strange, he thought to himself. But I did quite like the feeling of flying.

A few moments later, the loud clanging of the dormitory bell interrupted his thoughts. He brushed the floppy red hair out if his eyes, and flipped the covers back. Around him eleven other boys, all dressed in the same blue pajamas were climbing out of bed.

“Nervous for the test today, Fred?” asked a gangly boy with brown hair that was sticking straight up in the back.

“Not at all, mate. Phil and I filched the answers from Mrs. Dunphy’s desk yesterday!” said Fred, pushing his thick-framed glasses up his slightly crooked nose.

Conversations like these were taking place all throughout the Friarwood Home for Boys dormitory as the twelve boys who lived there got ready. The only boy who wasn’t chattering away was Felix. Felix, short for his age with bright orange hair and a smattering of freckles, didn’t fit in with the rest of the boys at the home. While the others cared for nothing more than the typical boy activities like baseball and chasing girls and wrestling each other to the ground, Felix was a dreamer and perfectly content to sit in a corner and read. He especially loved to read stories about big, happy families.

“Oi, out of my way, loser.” A tall boy grunted as he shoved his past Felix. Felix sighed and hurried towards the stairs.

Across town, a girl was also thinking of big families. The girl looked to be about seventeen, with light blond hair and wide blue eyes. Her name is Evie Pritchett. The bright morning sunlight shifting through the dusty window of the bookstore illuminated her slender form as she bent over a particularly large volume. She looked up at the shuffling sound of the owner coming into the room, and her glasses caught the sunlight and reflected on the ceiling.

“Can I help you?” inquired the old man with a look of disdain settling on his wrinkled face.

“No, sir. I’m just looking. I love books, but I’d never had the chance to stop in here. You have some very interesting ones.” Evie said in a polite way.

“Well… don’t get your grubby hands on anything you don’t plan on buying, young lady” the man said gruffly and he retreated behind the counter to observe the girl as she surveyed the crowded shelves.

The old man needn’t have worried. Evie was a very well behaved girl. She was the only daughter of two accountants. On the whole, she thought herself to not be very interesting. Such as is often the case with stories like these, it turns out that Evie was very interesting indeed.

Evie’s eyes scanned the faded colours and engraved words of the books on the shelves. The familiar titles seemed to smile out at her like old friends. Evie is an avid reader. She spent a lot of time alone, ever since she was a little girl. Her parents were good, but distracted. From a young age, Evie used books to fill the silence of her home.

Her imagination is her best, and usually her only, friend. Evie is kind and very polite, but other little children found her odd. It may have been the way she dressed; her parents too busy with work, Evie dressed herself every day. She favoured bright colours and patterns and therefore wore as many as she could. It may have been the way she would sit on her own at recess, a book in her lap, humming and smiling up at the sky. It may have been the way her hand was always first in the air to answer the teacher’s question. Or it easily could have been the inevitability of children to dislike anyone that is different.

The shopkeeper gazed over his thick-framed glasses at the girl. She was facing him; he could see her through the shelf. She looked up from the book she had been perusing , and smiled slightly.

“Do you ever wish you could bring books to life?” Evie said in a wistful voice.

The shopkeeper stared right at her. His sparkling hazel eyes seemed to betray his age. They bore into Evie’s own blue eyes. A curious sensation seemed to come over Evie. The tips of her fingers became very cold and the ends of her toes became very warm. The air around her seemed to waver and shimmer. As quickly as it had come on, it passed. Evie blinked twice and wondered if she shouldn’t have worn her heavy coat this morning. The shopkeeper was now busy behind the counter. Evie shook her head and began to scan the shelves again. A worn book with a pale blue cloth cover caught her eye. She pulled the book from the shelf. There was no title on the cover, just designs inlaid in silver. Evie flipped the cover back, there was no title on the inside page either.

When Evie turned toward the counter, she thought she saw the shopkeeper lower his eyes quickly, as if he’d been watching her the entire time. She couldn’t be sure though, as he was intently flipping through a catalog.

Evie glanced down at her watch. She had five minutes to get to school. She turned toward the counter and laid the pale blue book down. After she had paid, she thanked the shopkeeper and bustled out the door. A slight breeze ruffled her hair as she rushed to class, clutching her new book to her chest.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_v6w3k,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/v6w3k/this_is_the_first_chapter_of_my_workinprogress/,

This prologue was what I produced over the last hour, but I'm, of course, too close to it to assess it properly.  The characters within won't be featured again, as the content of the series takes place long after the prologue which is to provide some background to the readers, and provide basic explanation for what comes ahead.

I've never written anything science-fiction related before, and am hoping that I can get some constructive feedback on this prologue.  I'm wondering about 1) the flow/style of the writing (does it work, is it readable or too wordy? am I using some grammatical convention repeatedly that's awkward) 2) interest generated? 3) too much/too little info (what I want to get across is that there are a crap-load of 'arks' containing unknown cargo being sent out into all corners of space, while the people who created them are doomed) 4) any other feedback you may have.

***Abebe (Working Title)***

***

**Prologue**

Seven years ago, Avaro sounded a warning.

His counsel was ridiculed by his colleagues, his career destroyed, and he thereafter ignored.  Until today.

Avaro walked into the circular chamber, looking at the many faces around him.  He recognized many of the women and men in the room, though not all, and realized that the major scientific and political leaders from around the world were gathered together.

As he took his place in the center of the room, he saw his bearded, middle aged face appear on a large panel behind the Moderator's seat.  Taking one last look around him, Avaro realized that all those in the chamber had gone silent, having noticed his arrival, and were either staring directly at him or at a panel opposite them.  He faced the Moderator and nodded his readiness.

""Professor Avaro, thank you for coming.""

""Exalted Moderator, I have come at your summons, accompanied by your security officers, yet I find myself confused as to what transgression has caused you to summon  me.""  Avaro stood straight, just as defiant today as he'd been seven years ago when he'd been excommunicated from the scientific community, laughed out of the room by many of the same people in the audience today.

It was the Moderator who broke her gaze, ""It is with great humility that I have requested your presence here today, and it was not our intent to suggest you had done anything wrong.""

Avaro controlled his surprise as well as a small flicker of hope that they may now heed his warning.

""Seven years ago, you came before this body who collected on your word. At the time, you presented evidence that contradicted established theories and collected data, and we treated you, "" she paused, ""poorly.""

Avaro let out a laugh, quickly brought under control, at her description of his humiliation.   He stared at her again until she looked away again. 

""You are right, Professor Avaro, 'poorly' is not an adequate description of the disrespect we paid you, and what now appears to have been a foolish disregard of the message you brought.  We, today, invited government representatives from around the world to hear what you had to say and do our best to redress our mistake of seven years past.  We....and I apologize, and while I know that does not assuage the damage we may have done to you personally,  we hope you will again assume your place with us.""

Moderator Backar looked at him, not with pride and knowledge of her power over him, but with a hint of tentative hope mixed with obvious concern.  He wondered whether she expected his thanks.

""Moderator Backar, with all due respect, can you please identify for me the reasons for your change of mind?""

There was a shuffling around the room, as people leaned forward as though they could hear her response better.  The Moderator tapped a panel in front of her and a rush of white noise filled the room signalling the need for everyone to return to silence.  

""When you last visited us, we were unable to hear your message, and refused to accept that our survival as a species was significantly in question; the analysis you presented was so contrary to that of your peers, that we refused to listen to you with the respect you had already earned and by not considering your data seriously, we made a grave error we hope you can now help us remedy, if possible. Over the past three months, the very environmental changes you predicted would occur have begun to happen and we realize now that you were right. We also hope that you have continued to research and analyse what data you were able to collect and have a more optimistic outlook than that you gave us previously.""

""Moderator Backar, I hear your words and am, as always, impressed with your ability to  speak so eloquently while saying very little of substance.""  The audience began talking in urgent whispers, stunned at the disrespect shown their leader.  Avaro, though, didn't wait for the Moderator to signal silence or respond, ""Seven years ago, I came to you to warn that our atmosphere was going to significantly change and today you tell me this change is now beginning.  It is very true that my assessment of data ran contrary to the accepted interpretations, and I understand, but do not excuse, the response of this body to the dire information I shared.  You banished me from my profession, abjured my colleagues from speaking with me, and made my life difficult, and the task of continuing my research near impossible.  You took the data and analysis I did then, the computers and crystals on which I'd stored everything. 

Avaro continued after a ten second pause where he looked slowly around at his audience, recognizing that for the first time in seven years, people were listening to his words with serious interest.  ""I was unable to continue my research,"" he said to the discouraged face of the Moderator, ""but I do not believe that would have changed anything based on what little I was able to learn since then.  It is my belief that we cannot slow, stop, or reverse the process that is beginning now.  I suspect you have access to my previous report.""

Backar nodded in return, ""We have, yes.  We have been analysing it again, well, for the first time since last week, but lack your expertise.  If we have interpreted the data accurately and if the formula you developed provide a reasonably close estimate, we have entered stage four on your timeline.""

Avaro nodded sadly.  ""Then I am not certain what I can do for you. I am not a practical scientist, I'm theoretical-bio-statistical-researcher.   I analyse, well, analysed trends and made predictions that proved true.  I cannot reverse the situation.  I share your concern, and I share your fears and sadness.  If, as you say, we have reached stage four, we have fewer than eight years before we reach stage eight, and I know of no way to prevent that.""

The Moderator nodded at him, acknowledging his statements.  ""Our brief assessment was consistent with your interpretations, yet we hoped you would have suggestions for how we, as a people, can continue existing beyond the next eight years. We recognize that the time for analysis of what is happening has changed and analysis of data stretching back more than seven years matches your predictions to within three percentage points.""  She took a drink from a glass hidden behind her podium.  ""You demonstrated, those many years ago, an ability to see beyond accepted doctrine; your new theories proved out to better explain more than four centuries of climate data than the theories we'd followed for those four centuries. We hope you can apply the same facility of looking outside the box to the problem of our survival of a species.""

The chamber was deathly silent, all eyes staring at Avaro.  

""There, Moderator Backar, I just may be able to help.""

The last of the arks left the gravitational pull of the planet eight years and three days later.  Tens of thousands of the vessels had been launched over the last two years; changes were constantly being added to the manufacturing process as each was built and not only their physical construction was changed, but also their destination, means of propulsion, and consignment .  Every variation was designed to increase the likelihood of success, but Avaro would never know which, if any, would actually succeed.

Avaro looked down as he lost sight of that last ship in the night sky. In the last months, hundreds of ships were being launched daily around the world.  He smiled ruefully, recognizing that his people could do amazing things when they agreed upon a shared goal and worked together with a unified mind; Avaro also recognized that for the eight billion people who had been watching the launches with him, they'd never know.

He walked back inside his office, closing the deck door behind him.  After a minute of now familiar waiting, he removed his mask and breathed deep.  He sat down behind his desk, his elbows on the desk, and then, for the first time since he was a child, he buried his face in his hands and sobbed.

The beginning of the story.... this is kinda like a prologue, I guess? 

What is death? This is a question that has plagued humanity for years, and only one woman has the answer. Death fell in love with her, and has haunted her dreams ever since. This is what she says...
Death always appears at sunrise. He leaves his gratifying touch on someone, and let’s them choose when to enter his realm. Almost always, they come to him quickly, as his kingdom seems very inviting after years of battling Life. 
His realm is vast land that changes for every person. Those who have willingly come to Death, through sickness, or “natural causes” see his home as a pure white palace, pale and inviting, as if they will finally be at peace. Those who have died as a sacrifice, in order to save others, receive a hero’s welcome, with red and gold banners hanging from luxurious mansions. But those with a heart of stone, who only practice to deceive, are torn cruelly from their loved ones, and tossed into Death’s hands. There, they cannot see, for everything is black- so black they feel as if they do not even exist. 
But Death himself is not scary. He is a young boy, and he is an old man. He is very good, but he has the wickedest heart. He is a shape-shifter, appearing differently to everyone, ready to carry them from the mortal world. But no matter his shape, there is always something about him, so old, so wise, it cannot be hidden. This is what strikes fear in a person’s heart, in spite of his shape. 
Death is destined to live alone, forever. The loneliness of the job has caused Death to look terribly old in his natural form. For this reason, he wears a hooded robe, but instead of a scythe he carries an enchanted box which holds a wisp of hair from his great love. She was the old woman. When she realized Death could never live in the mortal world, she never saw him again.
 	He visits her every day. This is why she knows so much. This is why she never married. For she loves him back.

The ground came at full force. Tash felt her nose break as her body slammed onto the cold, hard surface. She tried to push herself up, but her arms wobbled and she let herself fall back down. She heard laughter behind her.
 
""Stupid girl, don't let us ever catch you talking to Mitch again!"" They ran off. Tash wiped the tears from her face as she heard footsteps heading her way. She braced for more pain. It didn't come.
 
""Tash! Oh shit, what have they done to you!"" Tom, her best friend, grabbed her and gently pulled her upright. Tash would have hugged him but she was in too much pain. Tom inspected her broken nose, scrunching up his own. He sighed as he pulled a tissue from his pocket and began cleaning her face. 
 
""You need to stand up for yourself, Tash. You can't keep letting them do this."" He said with a tinge of exasperation to his voice. Tash bowed her head slightly, her cheeks burning with shame. Tom caught her chin with his finger, making her look at him. She stared into his lovely brown eyes, so full of concern.
 
""I am not trying to upset you, Tish"" He said softly. ""You're my best friend and I don't like seeing you hurt for no reason."" Tash nodded glumly. ""I hadn't even been speaking to Mitch, they just want reasons to beat me. I try to reason with them, but.. I.."" Tash trailed off, not knowing how to end the sentence. Tom sighed again. 
 
""Let's get you to the hospital. We need to get that fixed up"" A splotch of blood fell from her aching nose and landed on her hand. She inspected the spot, fascinated by how the thick substance looked on her pale skin. She was startled when Tom wiped it off and started helping her to his car.
 
Her head started to spin as she walked, and she felt her body drop. ""Woah!"" Tom called out as he caught her. ""It's OK, I've got you."" He deftly bent down and swept her into his arms.

Jace

The evening rain gently hits my face as I walk down Eleventh Street and Gilden Avenue. It's about Nine-Thirty P.M. This isn't good. I need to find my prey before Ten.

""C'mon Billy."" I hear a woman behind me say. I take a quick peek behind me. It's a mother speaking to her son.

""Okay ma-ma."" The boy says back. He's exactly what I'm looking for.

Now or never, Jace. The voice in my head says. Who knows when another piece like him will come around right 
into your hands. Kill them. Now.

""As you wish."" I respond to the voice. I then walk over to the mother. ""Excuse me, Miss?"" When she turns around, I pull back my arm, and slash her throat in one quick and fluent motion. after doing this, her blood spatters all over my face and partially onto my hoodie. And before little Billy can scream, or even move, I put my hand over his mouth and place the knife against his throat. I then pull him into the dark depths of the alley that is behind us. Once at the end of the alley,I throw him into the wall on my left. This breaks the boy's nose on impact and causes him to bleed profusely.

""OWW!"" He screams while covering his nose. After he pulls his hands away from his face, he sees the blood all over his palms. He starts to frantically spin around, looking for an exit from the alley that shall soon become his deathbed. While he's doing this, I manage to grab him by pulling him to my body and covering his mouth. He starts emitting muffled screams.

""Shh, it's okay. Don't worry, it'll all be okay."" I say to the boy as I continually plunge my knife in and out of his torso. I can feel the blood spewing from his small body, but he's not yet dead. SO I take the knife and start moving it back and forth on his throat. ""I'll sing for you Billy. C'mon, listen to me sing."" I say over his violent gurgles as he starts to bleed out.

""You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy, when skies are grey. You'll never know dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my, sunshine away."" By the time I'm done singing, Billy has finally died. After pulling my knife away, I feel his body drop, but not his head. I open my eyes to the realization that I had cut straight through his spine. This caused his decapitation. I take his disembodied head from my chest, and drop it onto his fallen body.

After dropping Billy's head, I hear the approaching sound of police sirens. As they approach, I think to myself how quick it all happened. I now know that I can't get caught. I need to make it look like I went after the killer. I have less then Thirty seconds. Quickly, I take my knife and slice my finger tips. This so that it looks like I cut myself on the razor barbed wire fence in front of me. I then climb the fence, stick my left thigh on one of the razors, and then purposely fall. I most likely slipped one of my discs, but that is the price I must pay. I then get up, stick my three middle fingers into Billy's pool of blood, and rub it all over the front of my hoodie. I wipe the blood on my pant leg, and then search the wall to my left for a loose brick. Luckily, I find just that. That is where I place the knife. I then place the brick back.

I have probably Five seconds 'til the police car drives by and see the carnage that has happened. I hear the sirens get closer, as I close my eyes. But that's all that happens. Then, they just seem to get farther and farther away. I open my eyes to the sudden realization that the rat bastards never even stopped by. It was now up to me to get the police here. I take my phone out of my pocket and dial ""911.""

""Nine-One-One, what's your emergency?""

""Oh God, please help. Some random gut just came by and just killed a woman and her child. I tried to go after him, but I got snatched on the barbed wire fence that he escaped ov- AGGH! Please send help. There's blood everywhere an- and I have no idea what to do."" I scream with a fake sense of despair.

""Sir, I need you to calm down. Where are you exactly?""

""I'm - argh, fuck! I'm on Eleventh Street and Gilden Avenue.""

""Okay, Sir. I'm sending EMT's and the police to your location as we speak. Help is on the way.""

""Thank you ma'am."" I say while pressing end on my phone. ""Now, it begins."" I say as I look up in the sky. A maniacal smile forms on my face as I massage the scalp of Billy's decapitated head. ""We did it Billy. This is Day 
One.""


So, what did you guy's think? Please, feel free to write down anything that you think or feel about this piece. And just to clarify, this is the killer's POV and yes, he is Schizophrenic.

The dog in this story does not die. When I do occasionally read me a story that doesn’t just have pictures in it, I fucking hate it when there is a dog in it because I know as sure as I am chubby that eventually I am going to turn to a page and the words are going to force me to imagine a shotgun shell going through him or something like that. Why in the hell do writers always do that? I have a theory, actually, but I’d probably offend someone if I told you it. I always try not to offend people. What I don’t get, however, is why in the fuck they have decided that killing a dog is any better than killing a person. People are awful creatures that do awful things. All that dog does is whatever its owner tells him to-- 

Sorry. I’ve gotten carried away. Let me try again.

While a whole shitload of savage werewolves will certainly meet their untimely end (usually at the hands of my spike laced baseball bat), I hereby give you my word that no harm will come to McClane. 

Trying to figure out where and how to begin a story such as this has been very difficult, so I would like to apologize in advance for jumping around. I’m not a good writer, either. So I’d like to apologize for that, too. I don’t think it is very important, giving my occupation, to be a good writer. But, as I sit in my living room with a fresh frozen pizza sitting in front of me, I find myself itching to start telling my story.

My name is Dale, and I kill werewolves for a living. I’m 26. I have brown hair. I live in a small town called Watiba in Mississippi. Imagine every single bad thing you’ve ever heard about Mississippi, put them into one town, and multiply the “so bored I’ve contemplated gouging my eyeballs out” by a factor of ten and you can get a pretty good idea of what Watiba is like. Miles and miles of fields only broken up by the occasional dirt road that is connected to another dirt road that is connected to yet another dirt road before it connects to a two lane road with a Piggly Wiggly on the corner. I’m saying there ain’t much here. You get used to it though, I suppose. At least as used to it as you get to getting root canals, I would expect. I live alone in a small one story house. It is green. Ugly green that always seem to draw comparisons to the color of Linda Blair’s projectile vomit in The Exorcist. I live alone, except for McClane. He is pretty good company. He kind of looks like a cross between a German Shepherd and Shih Tzu, if you can picture it. I hope that his mama was the German Shepherd because if it was the other way around I can’t imagine her living to give birth to him as big as he is.

I got me a friend, too, contrary to popular belief. His name is Dan, but I’m not going to call him Dan. I read a book before I started writing this story out that taught me that publishers don’t much like to read stories that have two people with similar names in it. Something about it not being clear to the reader who is who. Or is it who is whom? Either way, it didn’t really make much sense to me, because I know that I’m Dale and I know that he is Dan, but I for damn sure ain’t writing this just for shits and giggles so I’m going to call him Todd instead. That should be different enough that y’all can tell the difference.

I told you earlier that I kill werewolves for a living. That was both the truth and a lie all at the same time. Actually, my job is to find people that have disappeared. People that have gotten themselves killed off by a wolf. You see, this used to be a pretty normal town. Aside from the bar fights and the occasional theft of a prize pig there weren’t ever no crime to speak of. But one day, people just started turning up missing. Keep in mind that only about 300 people even live here, so when a few people turn up gone you can bet that everybody in town knows about it. And hell, at this point, we’ve lost about 30 people. That’d be the same as a big town, like Atlanta, losing about 300,000. You can see why it’s such a big deal here, I think. 

Like I said, I’m probably going to jump around a bit, and it looks like I’ve already gotten a bit ahead of myself. I guess I should just tell you about how I got roped into all of this to start with.


I.
Todd and I had just finished watching Die Hard for about the umpteenth time one evening about a year ago when I suddenly had me a hankering for a glass of bourbon. We loaded up into his old Dakota pick-up truck and decided to head into town to get us a bottle of Tennessee’s Finest. Just to make that clear for you, the name of the brand is actually Tennessee’s Finest, but I suspect that there must be far better bourbon that comes from the state of Tennessee considering that this comes in a plastic bottle and is only $4.52 a fifth. Anyway, we were heading to the store to get us a fresh bottle of Finest when what looks like one of them cute little furry guys from Star Wars comes running out into the middle of the road. Todd slammed on the brakes just in time to miss this cute little mother fucker, and when I looked at him, I could have sworn I could actually see the exact moment that his asshole finally unpuckered. Todd and I both are real softies for animals, you see.

“Dale, what in the hell was that little thing?”

“It looked like one of them little furry things from Star Wars!”

“You mean an Ewok?” Todd has always had a better memory than I do.

“Yeah, an Ewok!”

“Dale, why are you yelling?”

“I don’t know, Todd! I can’t stop!” 

“Well stop it.”

“Ok, Todd!”

“God dammit, Dale. Get out of the truck and make sure he is alright.”

So I rolled down the window so that I could reach out and pull the door handle open. For some reason or another Todd’s truck can’t be opened on the passenger side from the inside. Todd put the flashers on the truck and I waddled over to the side of the road and there he was, with this look of terror in his eyes. I wish I could tell you that I reached my arms out and he jumped into them and we were buddies right away, but that would be a lie. No, instead, when I reached my hand down to check on him this little dog stood up, growled, and charged at me. No, that isn’t right. He didn’t charge at me, he charged through me. That may sound weird, but his eyes weren’t even looking at me, but at something that was over my shoulder. I crouched just in time to see his balls barely clear my head as he took off back across the street. 

“Todd, I think we scared him and he took off,” my voice trailed off as I saw the fear on my friend’s face. 

My eyes followed his gaze, and even through the dim light that was provided by the full moon that night, it was clear what was happening. This little Ewok looking dog was charging full force towards something. It looked like it might be human, or like it might have been at one time, but its back was bent at an impossible angle, and it made a high pitched noise as it raced towards our new friend in arms.

“Todd, get the shotgun!” 

“Why are you yelling again, Dale?”

“You don’t think this is a good time to yell?”

I lunged myself back to the cab and grabbed Todd’s twelve gauge Remington, a Christmas present from his grandmother before she passed away (“now maybe you can stop borrowing mine”). Without thinking, I swung around, chambered a round, and aimed at the chest of this beast.

“Pull!” yelled Todd.

“What? Why is it ok when you yell?”

Before Todd could answer, the close range of the shot gun blast had caused the entire torso of the thing to vaporize. With a jolt, the head and legs, now two distinct different chunks, fell to the ground. Our Ewok friend stopped with a start, looked confused for a moment, and then took a shit directly on the head of the beast. 

“Good dog.” Todd and I both said at the same time. It was clear that this was our kind of friend.

“What was that thing, Todd?” 

“The hell if I know, but good shooting, Tex.”

“Get the flashlight.”

Todd recovered his Mountain Dew LED flashlight from the glove box as we approached the head of whatever the fuck this thing was.

“Is it a Sasquatch?” I asked.

“Don’t be silly, Dale, it’s not a Sasquatch. It might be Bigfoot, though.” I realized that perhaps this entire time I really was the smarter of the two of us.

“Bigfoot is a Sasquatch, you idiot.”

“I thought a Sasquatch was a vegetable.”

“That’s a squash, you idiot.”

“I think both are correct.” I gave up trying to explain.

As we approached the head of this thing, while trying to avoid the fresh pile of dog shit, Todd, I, and our furry friend all looked down into the eyes of what can only be described as a werewolf. I would love to give you some long description of his teeth being as sharp as razor spikes or his eyes looking like evil itself, but at this point there wasn’t much scary about this thing. And the longer we stared at it, the less scary it became. That isn’t to say that we got used to what it looked like, but that it literally became less horrifying by the moment. It was changing, quite rapidly, and looking more like a human. The excess hair seemed to evaporate right off of his face as the ears shifted from the top of it heads down towards the side and took on the typical pattern of a human. His eyes that initially looked like an old friend of ours after having been up for three days on crystal meth, began to shrink to their normal size. 

“Holy shit! It’s Deacon Brown!”

“You’re yelling again, Dale.” 

I chose to whisper instead.

“Holy shit, it’s Deacon Brown.”

“How can you stay so calm at a time like this!”

“I fucking hate you, Todd.”

“You killed Deacon Brown, Dale. What were you thinking?”

“You saw that thing before it turned into him, right?”

“Oh. Yeah, I did. You’re right. Good job. This isn’t Deacon Brown, it is just some impostor, right?”

“I don’t know, Todd. What do we do?”

“We hide this thing and we get the hell out of here, that’s what we do!”

“I really wish McClane hadn’t taken a shit on him if we are going to have to touch him.”

“McClane?”

“Yeah, McClane,” I said as I looked over at the dog and he began to lick my hand.

“He’s like John McClane, ain’t he? Here he was, all by himself, in a foreign place with only himself he could depend on. And when things started looked bad, he didn’t run away from it. He stood up for himself, and proved that he could handle his business.” By the time I finished, I could see the excitement spreading across Todd’s face.

“Abso-fucking-lutely, man! Looks like we got us a mascot!”

“A mascot? For what?”

“You don’t think there’s going to be more of these things, man? There’s always more of these things in situations like this. And it is going to be our job to kill the shit out of them. It’s going to be great.”

“What are you talking about, Todd?”

“Seriously, wasn’t that awesome? We have to do that again!”

I shook my head, but I knew he was right. I could feel even then that this was only the beginning.

This is the beginning of the first book of a projected trilogy called Elysian Skies. I've been wanting to create a fresh take on the post-apocalyptic story with some added fantasy elements. This has already gone through countless rewrites and changes.

**Premise:** Humanity has escaped from an unknown disaster (backstory is gradually revealed throughout) to a world where the air is toxic and fatal, and all sources of water are either depleted or poisonous. The story follows several characters who are immune to earth's toxins and are being persecuted and hunted by various other groups. 

I've tried to make the prologue vague and create intrigue. Should I add some more explanation right off the bat, or is it enough of a teaser to make you want to keep reading it?

He was bewildered and unable to move, as the torrent of water, mud and stones roared towards him in a deadly, dirty flood.

The roaring was very loud and very near, and a horrible moist breeze announced the danger ahead along the confined space of the subterranean area.

“Flee!” 

Without thinking his feet began to move, a sublime function deep inside the older parts of his brain working so well.

He ran.

The avalanche of dirt was on him.

“I can’t make it”, he thought while his brain spilled chemicals that induced strength and kept his panic levels on a short leash.

He felt his limbs trembling and singing on a high note. 

Muscles that he was never aware existed worked in perfect, autonomous harmony.

If he wanted to survive, there was only one way.

“Be faster than death.”

He dashed deeper, into the older parts of his life’s work.

The cave widened a little, but still the only way was down, with treacherous gravity sending a wave of sure demise behind him.

He knew, if he would not find the exit to the surface, he would only have seconds left.

His lungs burned. 

His legs hurt and his heart pushed absurd amounts of blood through his system.

There was only darkness before him and only agony behind him.

“The tunnel crossing is here somewhere.”

If he missed it, he was sure, he had lost the race and he could give up and welcome his end.

He continued his mindless run and almost missed the junction.

When his brain screamed to turn left, he did it fully automatic.

Only after he had passed several meters in the upward tunnel, he recognized it consciously.

After several more steps he finally stopped and looked behind him.

He saw the water tear away the structures now beneath him, but it would not for long stay so low.

His legs began to move again, upward, he hoped, and away.

The feeling in his limbs came back, and he felt tired, exhausted and weak.

Still he managed to move, but then his flight came to an abrupt stop.

“It’s gone!”

He felt the ugly wave of panic drowning his mind again.

The wonderful opening of the upward tunnel was gone, replaced by solid soil.

Without a thought, his hands began to dig the dirt away, first slow, then at an incredible speed.

He felt the pain in his hands when he hit a rock, but he kept on digging.

The water level behind him was already climbing up the tunnel, ready to claim victory and take his life.

With almost all his strength gone, and his hands bloody, he saw light.

It hurt, it burned in his eyes.

The strong smell of a hot summer day hit his nose and his lungs.

He almost could not breathe while struggling through the dirt.

His eyes were still useless, only seeing bright white and light gray shapes.

With a last mighty push of his hurting legs, he was above ground and heard a voice say “Stop the water, Dave! Over there, I see the mole!”

So this is the void. Or death, perhaps.

I wonder if time’s passing. Maybe I’m just too used to ticking clocks. But there’s this longing in me that doesn’t seem to wear off — in fact it’s getting more and more unbearable with each moment that passes. How long a moment is, that I can’t answer.

I don’t know how long I’ve been here either, or even if there *is* a “here” where I can be.

All I know is that I can think.

Perhaps this is what I’ve always been, a stream of thoughts in the middle of nowhere. Nothing more than disembodied words adrift in the emptiness. It seems plausible.

No, no, it doesn’t. In that stream floats the idea that I’ve once been more than that. I can only wonder what or when. Probably a long time ago. If there is such a thing as time.

Wait, there’s more. Faint memories of things I’ve seen, of things I’ve done. Letters, words. A color.

No, the void is colorless.

The emptiness can’t be red.

My longing grows larger than the darkness. I *am* more than thoughts, I can… I can *feel.*

Pain. Cold. Paralysis. Ragged breathing.

Not death nor nothingness. Where am I?

“Now, now.” Not my voice. Or is it?

I try to speak. I can’t. I try to move. I can’t.

“He won’t wake up.” A woman’s voice.

“Hush, he’s coming to.”

Sound. Water dripping somewhere to my right.

Thirst. Sore throat, dry tongue. When I open my mouth, all that comes out is a faint croak.

“Hush! Let him.”

How can I be cold with a hot knife piercing through my side?

“Water.” It hurts too much to speak. I wonder if I can swallow. “Please… water.”

At first there’s no response, but then I hear shuffling. Some liquid flowing, more shuffling. Cold glass presses against my lips, moistness trickles down my chin. Soft fingers force my mouth open for the blessing to touch my tongue. Not nearly enough.

“More…” I’ll beg if I have to.

“Easy, now.”

This time I can move my arms, groping with trembling hands. I’m so thirsty. At last they bump into arms; my eager fingertips trace them towards my face and grab the cup with a strength I didn’t expect to have.

“Easy, easy. Take it slow.” Is that concern in her tone?

I won’t take it slow. She doesn’t know how much I need this. I upend the cup.

Now I’m drowning.

Strong hands grab me by my shoulders and sit me up, gentler ones keep my head upright. Each cough tears a new gash in my throat, as if that water had never touched it.

“She said easy. Let’s try again, but slower this time.” His voice doesn’t sound concerned.

He won’t let go. Why is he holding me?

I feel something tied around my head. Bandages? The smell of blood and waste almost overwhelms me when I finally notice it. I recall I should be bleeding, but can’t remember why.

“I can’t see.”

This is no bandage, it’s a blindfold. Fear creeps through my body. I must escape!

“No need to see anything right now.” His grip tightens. “It’s no use to struggle.”

“Save your strength for later.” She does sound like she cares. “You’ll need it.”

Who are these people?

“I demand to know where I am!” The authority in my voice surprises me. It seems unwarranted. The pathetic order of a broken man.

“You’re in no position to demand anything, Hand 052.”

Hand 052.

All those memories suddenly flood my mind again. The nightmare in the void. It *was* a nightmare, wasn’t it? Surely it was. It must have been.

No amount of wishing can transform the past in a bad dream.

In the wake of the sudden realization, all I’m left with is my shattered hope.

My body goes limp; tears stream from my eyes. This man is right: it’s no use to struggle. It doesn’t matter where I am or who they are.

That sword should have killed me. Why didn’t it? What happened then?

The woman lays me back down. “Rest now. Your questions will be answered in time.”

“It’s not answers I need. Just leave me here to die.”

The man chuckles. “You can be sure we’ll kill you if need be. Not here, though. It’ll just have to wait until Ard speaks with you.”

“Who’s Ard?” They don’t answer. I shrug, then cough with pain. “Whoever he is, he must come before I lose the last of my blood.”

A soft hand raises my head. “Here.” She grips my hair when I turn my lips away. “It’s just water. I know you want it.”

I’m still wary, but my body doesn’t let me refuse. I drink slower this time.

“You aren’t dying, at least not soon. The blood you smell is from your clothes.” There’s now a shade of pride in the woman’s tone. “The bullet didn’t go in very deep. I removed it and closed your wounds. Cef here said it was a waste of time, but I couldn’t just leave you that way.”

Cef snorts. “You’re lucky Sia has a soft spot for broken people. Messenger or no, she’s given you more than any bat has ever deserved.”

“Who *are* you?” Instead of replying, they go silent and stay that way.

Time seems to go slower and slower as those scenes keep replaying in my head, my pain never receding.

Just when I’m thinking the sound of dripping water will drive me crazy, I hear steps from somewhere in front of me. From the echo, I gather we must be in a very large room. I’m shivering, but whether it is from the lack of a fire or from some fever, I don’t know.

“At last I meet our famed Messenger,” says one of the newcomers. “And all bloody too, the second best kind of bat I know.” There’s a smile to his voice. “Nothing to say? I hear you were quite vocal that morning, Hand 052.”

I hear soft chuckles from all around me. Six people, at least.

How long have I been sleeping?

“Very well, let me begin, then. I’m Ard, at your service. May I know your name? I don’t want to keep addressing you as a number. After what you did, you certainly earned being more than that to me.”

I remain silent. Someone starts tapping their foot.

“You’ll talk to me, Hand. Rest as much as you need. Cef and Sia will keep you well fed until you’re back up on your feet. Now, if you’ll excuse me, there’s a city I must—”

Hurried steps come from behind Ard along with a very young voice. A girl.

“Chief Beetle, we’ve found two more infected in the streets.” She pauses to recollect her breath. “They were writhing in the gutters, but we’ve brought them in anyway as you ordered. They’re back there with the others.”

“I’ll go see them in a minute. You did well.” His attention turns back to me. “The sooner you talk, the sooner we can put an end to this, bat. What I need of you is far from done, you can be sure of that. We must finish what you started.”

When I refuse to speak, Ard leaves me alone with Cef and Sia.

Who *are* these people?

He woke some time in the night to the sound of thunder and rain as it poured down on the thatch roofing and sprayed the stone walls of the house. He discovered he was naked beneath the wool blankets. The cot he lay on was stiff, the mattress thinly stuffed with straw. Alarmed, he worried the girl robbed him and left him in some abandoned farmhouse.

He sat up and immediately regretted it. The pain in his left arm was excruciating and he lay back down. It was bandaged and a makeshift sling held it across his chest. The bandage was fresh linen and smelled of herbs. When he peeked beneath the bandages he saw that his wounds had been cleaned and even sewn shut. *No thief would tend me so*, he realized and lay back down. When lightning crashed and lit up the room, he realized he had not been moved very far from where he’d passed out. His mail hung on the spade handle and his tunic – the sigil of his house sewn on the left breast — was tossed across a bag of feed. The rest of his clothes were nowhere to be seen.

Briefly he considered escaping into the night and finding his way back to the road, but another loud crack of thunder and downpour of rain put an end to it. Paul decided he’d never go out naked anyway, and so he closed his eyes and returned to sleep.

Only once more did he wake up in the night and only partially. He thought he saw the girl — *Tani, was it?* — sitting in a chair next to him, but he had fallen back into slumber too quickly. The memory seemed more a dream than reality and when he finally woke, he hardly remembered at all.

The storm was gone and sunshine flooded in through the window at the far end of the room. It was a feed room, he discovered, though a poorly stocked one. It was almost bare. His cot was nothing more than a woolen blanket thrown over a bed of hay. By the time he could sit up, the girl came in with a wood bowl and spoon. She placed it on a chair that she dragged over and left it by his side.

“Eat that,” she said, her tone wary. “It’ll make you stronger. Need your help today I will.”

“Help?” he grunted, shoving himself up onto his side and spooning the porridge in the bowl. It smelled delicious and he was only then aware of his hunger. As he spooned it into his mouth, she nodded. “Aye, I need some help with the chores. Ain’t no one else gonna do’em. Soon as you get well, soon as you help.”

Paul blanched. “Chores? I don’t do chores girl. Do your own bloody work, I’m injured!” He felt suddenly sorry for saying that. Her lips clenched together and she upended the bowl of porridge onto the chair. “Fine, then get your own bloody food.” She turned and left then, slamming the door to the main house shut behind her.

Paul sighed and looked at the seat where the remains of his breakfast was quickly sliding off the edges of the chair and onto the dirt floor. His stomach twisted into a hungry knot and he quickly glanced to the door before he took his spoon and scooped what he could right off the seat. The act made him feel pathetic but he consoled himself that getting strong and getting out of here was more important than pride.

As he was shoving the last bit of salvageable porridge into his mouth, the girl came back with an armful of clothes. He wiped his mouth and gently placed the spoon on the seat. She paused there in the door, staring at it before she looked down at the floor. “Your clothes were soiled, I had to burn them this morning. These were my da’s. He wasn’t much bigger than you, I think.” She came near to the foot of his make-shift bed and placed them on a feedbag. Paul pushed himself up onto an elbow and stared at her. He opened his mouth but found he had nothing to say and closed it again.

“I apologize for that earlier, miss.”

“M’lord should rest,” the girl said. Her eyes met his for a brief moment and he caught anger in them. He sighed and opened his mouth to say something but the words died in his throat. *I am not much one for talking to commoners. Leave that to the men capable of it.* All Paul could do was nod. The pain in his arm and shoulder surged then and he groaned, laying his head back down. When he thought to look for her, the girl was gone.

For the rest of the day Paul slipped in and out of sleep. His pain came in unending waves that made sitting up difficult. Occasionally Tani — her name, he learned, was short for Tanielle — brought in something small for him to eat and changed his dressings. She applied new herbs to the wounds, a foul smelling concoction she said would help it fight off infection and help with the pain.

The pain never ended and the poultices smelled worse than an infection ever would, so Paul wasn’t sure it was helping. The next few days followed in that matter, with Tani bringing him light meals and water and changing his bandages while he was too weak and too in pain to rise. After two days he could manage to sit for a short time but it took nearly half a fortnight for him to stand on his own.

During his stay in the room, little changed. A chicken wandered in once but Tani quickly chased it out. There were no rats to be seen but he’d spied a fat cat more than once lurking around. The feed bags were tended to by Tani, who dragged them out on a small splint that she looped around her shoulders. They spoke little. When they did, she spoke quietly and deferentially to him but always with an undercut of scorn. He tried to speak to her like he did with the servants at Hallow Hill. *They were nice folk and I treated them well, why does she hate me so?*",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1374997826.0,,,True,t3_1j6zel,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1j6zel/feedback_hallow_hill_part_6_continuing_my_gritty/,

I don&amp;rsquo;t know what they&amp;rsquo;re looking for, but I don&amp;rsquo;t find it likely they would patrol the Archival Section in such force at this time of night without some very good reason.

Unfortunately, time tends not to wait for questions to be answered.

As one of the few Hands who knows of the secret passageways, escaping this place should actually be easy for me. That is, if only all Arms and Pauldrons didn&amp;rsquo;t know of them as well. I can very well throw myself right into their clutches without knowing it before it&amp;rsquo;s too late.

This is too big to hinge on a gamble, yet here I go doing just that again.

My nose itches from the mold, so much that I have to hold in a sneeze. I&amp;rsquo;m so focused on not making noise as I shuffle towards an exit that I almost bump into a guard. It&amp;rsquo;s a pity he&amp;rsquo;s decided to be thorough in his search. I have but a second to decide if he lives or dies.

I hope he felt no pain.

I&amp;rsquo;m uneasy as I emerge behind the Tower. After the storeroom, I&amp;rsquo;d come to expect search parties to be swarming the whole Palace, but only one sentry makes his rounds in this area. Routine. It&amp;rsquo;s as if no one else suspects of anything.

Sunrise is upon me. Time&amp;rsquo;s a luxury I don&amp;rsquo;t have, so I push forward despite being almost certain they&amp;rsquo;re expecting me. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing out of the ordinary inside, but I keep going.

I hesitate at the door of Emergency Communications. One guard and one technician in there. Innocents. But if that&amp;rsquo;s what it takes to end this farce and throw those murderers out of their stage, I&amp;rsquo;ll do it.

The end begins now.

It is generally not considered a good thing to wake up in the gutter if one has been sober.

Fortunately, this wasn't a problem for him.

He reached into his coat and found a bottle of Whisky.

Specifically Bearhuggers’ Whisky.

He opened it with his right hand and took a sip. 

It tasted like sticky horse piss, but he wasn’t drinking it for the taste.

The real problem with drinking, if you were to ask him (and were lucky enough to get an answer out of him) was that one drink’s one too many and two‘s not enough.

With a little effort he climbed out of the gutter and started walking up the sidewalk.

It was midnight. So, the only lights were from St. May’s Hospital up the street and Frank’s 24 hour Diner facing it. He took his bottle of Bearhuggers and put it inside his coat. It was a cheap, threadbare sports coat and looked like it had been stolen from a used car salesman.

That however, was not true.

The coat just happened to be in the car when he stole it.

The rest of his clothes were more of the same, completely worn, filth ridden and downright disgustful.

So, it stands to reason that he didn't look very respectable.

He stopped for a second and looked around.

He then made his way to the dumps around the Diner.

A woman came out of the hospital. She was walking in his direction. She seemed a bit worried and in a hurry. She looked like she’d been crying.

Well, she DID come out of a hospital in the middle of the night.

He decided to try his hand.

‘Any change miss?’ he asked.

She looked at him.

‘Huh…? Oh yes’ said Jane as she put some change into his hand and continued down the road to her car.

‘Thanks’.

As he was putting the change in his pocket he felt something unusual in the palm of his hand. He took it out and looked at it.

It was a key, specifically, a motel room key. It had a JJ engraved on it that he recognized form JJ's Motel behind the Diner. He turned back hoping to return it, but she was already long gone. He turned his eyes back to his hand.

Well, it was the middle of the night and it didn’t look like she’d be back anytime soon. There was nothing but woods on either side of the road for miles.

He’d be in and out, in a couple of hours. A bed sounded a hell of a lot more comfortable than the cardboard box he'd left in the dumps. 

‘Well…why not ?’

1374320466.0,4,self.KeepWriting,1iovec,"[Feedback] Hot and Haughty - 579 words, Obsessive Romance (I'm a brand new writer, so any and all feedback is greatly appreciated)",George_Benson,6,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1iovec/feedback_hot_and_haughty_579_words_obsessive/,"She was beautiful. Roger had to give her that. Her glistening chocolate hair draped over the supple curve of her breasts, framing an innocent, oval face. What's more, Vanessa was one of the highest ranked ballerinas in the country, so her body was tight and effortlessly graceful. And she was intelligent, a top student, loved by all her teachers. And she was passionate, voraciously tearing into cryptic Latin texts and twisted Shakespeare plays. And she was polite; she never misplaced a word or spoke ill of another in their presence. And finally, even in the face of this borderline perfection, she still managed humility.

But that's why Roger couldn't stand her. As she strutted from plebeian to plebeian pretending to commiserate with their inconveniences and chuckling hollowly at their awful jokes, you could sense her sentiment of superiority almost oozing through her skin, growing with each inferior she encountered. She only wasted her time with this mediocrity to vindicate her own accomplishments. Vanessa's act of humility was just that: an act.

It was certainly subtle. You had to look past her actions and question her motives. Why did she blush with every compliment? Why did she offer to help cute boys study? Why, when told she was smart, did she lightly assert that she'd never scored an A on a math test? Surely these are the signs of a humble, virtuous individual? Not when they're to garner attention and satiate her edacious ego.

When it came to guys, she never spoke first. That would make her seem desperate. Instead, she was to be so damn irresistible that cute boys would have to call her pretty and smart and beg for a date. Then she could giggle girlishly, lavishly deny their claims, and, after unctuously telling them how much she appreciated the offer, say no. That way, she'd always be desirable (guys want what they can't have, right?)

And it worked. Vanessa had plenty of top-notch suitors, but she never kissed a guy, probably never even went on a date. As she informed her friends, none had been worthy of her. She did, however, feel like the hottest shit on the planet. Guys sent her flowers, chocolates, poems, and snapchats and she flitfully played along, milking every last drop of attention from these doomed souls. If the stream of gifts dammed, she became irritated. Her teeth grinding together, her fingers fretfully crumbling her notebook paper, she would obsessively ponder how anyone could possibly not be attracted to her. She would question her own personal value (what if I'm not worthy of *him*?) and, awed by this young stud's ability to resist her, fall in love for the first time. But as soon as her subsequent batted eyelashes, slight smiles, and light laughs rekindled his fire, she, confidently returned to her throne of superiority, would dismiss her fleeting feelings and return to stringing him along, creating a vicious, inescapable cycle for the male whilst bolstering the ego of the female.

So what is a victim of this supposed cycle to do? In Roger's case, he will be content to silently and mercilessly judge her. Blood will gush angrily through his cheeks, adrenaline will force him to fidget and sweat, and his eyes will track her relentlessly across the room, but he will not utter a word. After all, no one can prove your error if you hide it and demonizing Vanessa is easier than accepting personal failure.

The citizens like to say that he who robs a thief is forever forgiven, even though that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been true ever since the Law was established, centuries ago. Can the same be said about one such as me? Will I be seen like that? Will I be remembered?

The taped atrocity had been filmed in black and white, but in my mind&amp;rsquo;s eye the red blood was very much vivid. Three throats sliced open, the dark liquid first gushing out then trickling down in ever weaker and slower pulses. Glazed eyes. Thick globs dripping from a short blade, small drops running from the twisted lips of a madman.

&amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo; I ask the maniacal face now imprinted in my memory.

I know his name. I know which Power he represents. I never knew anything personal about the man, either from before or after he stepped up to take his seat, but I thought I knew him as well as I could, given my position.

I thought he was the face of Justice. So did the world, but no more. Or so I hope.

I know I&amp;rsquo;ll be forever haunted by the guilt of my blindness, by the shame of being so proud of serving unquestioningly. I know I&amp;rsquo;ll be hearing the screams and the hysterical laughter up until my very last minute. It&amp;rsquo;s fortunate that my final moment isn&amp;rsquo;t likely to be too far along. In fact, I yearn for it.

I long for my end because my sole reason for living is no more. Or rather, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been following ghosts all my life, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been the Hand of a murderer.

The clarity of hindsight is now what truly blinds me.

&amp;ldquo;Who are you now?&amp;rdquo; I ask myself.

Those eyes finally focus on me. He surprises me with a smile then points at something with his chin. A piece of paper with an elaborate drawing. As the senior Hand, it falls to me to collect evidence, so I reach for it. There&amp;rsquo;s a note on the other side.

Speedway

I sit on the floor beside my chaise lounge listening  
to the wailing of Sonny Rollins’ sax,   
the bronzed notes haunt the air from a 1988 remastered vinyl imprint of a 1959 recording,  
which I found on Amazon one day while skimming, draining the last dregs  
of a work-away day on my laptop in 2012. The thick 180-gram disc turns  
and turns on a Crosley table, like the Wheel in the Sky. I have Journey’s “Captured”  
with the “The Wheel in the Sky” too, recorded live in concert at Cobo Hall, 1980.  
My mobile vibrates, but I do not hear because it is summer in Speedway  
and that means that the buzzing market is cornered by the pack of Indy Cars  
circling the IMS like a swarm of enraged hornets revolving around some nest  
made of metal and fiberglass at the center of the infield. The center of the infield is not  
a beehive, however, but a curled-up arm of the Brickyard Golf Course that intrudes  
its verdant fairways and tidy, high-and-tight greens, all of it speckled  
with shallow ponds of sand and strands of scraggly weeds which players’ call  
“the rough.”

I’ve only been golfing once and I imagine the intended tranquility of the sport  
would be spoiled by the roar of Indy Car engines and the smell of bald rubber tires  
burning on the pavement. But I’ve only been golfing once, so how would I know?  
My aunt was worried that the local pizzeria on Main Street, named after a California  
surfer-bum and painter, had closed down. Turns out, they were open for business, but  
no one shops on Main Street in Speedway, so they only looked abandoned.  
I dare you to point to a town that better encapsulates the spirit of the Midwest than Speedway.

Race weekend is a rager, as long as you bought your alcohol before Sunday.  
The cars on the track, I hear, are better and better every year. Not even the drivers,  
wrapped up like fire-proof corporate bulletin boards,  
can keep pace with the technological edge that seems to slice by the finish line  
on a record lap time each year. And yet these high-octane computerized rolling darts  
find themselves snared by the lax orbit of Speedway. A showcase of dichotomy:  

sweating in August, frozen in February,  
drunk and wheezing Saturday night, singing hymnals Sunday morning,  
future home to a wind tunnel and a roundabout. A high-tech hamlet encased in the old amber  
of the 20’s, when executives at the transmission plant built their homes on a grid  
of criss-crossing narrow streets and mandated that every new home include an enclosed garage  
because Speedway would be a city of the future and the future was one  
where automobiles dominated the streets.  

Lawns mowed, weeded and seeded. Old women hanging wind chimes  
and feeders for the cardinals from their porches.   
Police patrolling in new Dodge Chargers the color of polished onyx.  
Stone-and-mortar buildings, empty like sun-bleached skulls, on Main Street.  
The Red Box on Crawfordsville Road. A merry-go-round of fireworks   outlets and discount tobacco shops and poorly-stocked convenience stores all taking turns trying their hand  
in the same low-traffic, short-lease buildings that they set up in the year before.  
Maybe I’m fooling myself when I say I don’t need a John Cougar Mellencamp record.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1hz3kl,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1hz3kl/speedway_a_long_poem_about_the_my_hometown/,

“Beth, it will be alright. Don’t you cry,” Haedus cradled the frail girl in his arms. “T-t-they w-a-want to hang m-
m-me,” Beth said, overwrought with fear. Haedus hugged the girl closer to
his chest, his heartbeat eased her. They were running out of time. Haedus’s
thoughts were not of why they were after Beth, but rather how he could get her
to safety before it was too late. “Well, that’s not going to happen,” he said,
keeping his composure.


 “You can’t stop them, t-t-they’re monsters.”


“Watch me,” Haedus rested his chin atop her head. Huffing loudly, a
stocky boy clumsily entered the barn. “They’re coming!” he shuddered, his
eyes unblinking. “Quick, Beth! Go to the well just like we talked about,”
Haedus led her to the rear of the timbered structure. “Did they say how long
until the hanging, Elius?”             


“No, but I saw the council headed this way by
carriage,” he said, placing a knitted bag over Beth’s shoulder. 

“She needs to get
out of here, now!” Haedus knelt down before Beth, gripping her shoulders.
“Look at me.” Beth clenched the strap of the bag in one hand, her body
still trembling. “I promise I won’t let anything happen to you,” he took her
hand in his. “Remember what I told you earlier?”          

   “Y-yes,” drops of terror
slid down her face. “Haedus, she has to go! I see the carriage!” Elius
urged, peeking out of a small hole in the large wooden doors. “What did I
tell you to do?” Haedus kept his eyes locked with hers, ignoring Elius’s warning.
“Pray, run, hide,” said Beth. Haedus wrapped her in his arms. “Now
go on, and run. Run as fast as you can,” he forced her to exit through a hidden
back door. She paused not wanting to leave the two men. 

“Haedus, I love
you. You’re the best brother anyone could ask for.”

 “I love you too. I will
see you soon.” 

“Promise?”            

 Haedus kissed her forehead. “I promise.”
He watched as Beth barreled through the field of straw and large corn
stalks until she faded from view. “The witch!” a man hollered, barging
through the front doors. His posse of five stood close behind. Haedus and Elius
stood fixed in such stances one would think they were primed for war. “Where is
she?” he tugged the collar of Haedus’s shirt. “Tell me what you know!”
“I’d rather die,” Haedus said stiffly. The man stepped back, chuckling
mordantly. “Do tell me how death would serve as more fulfilling, Haedus.”
“I would rather die at the stakes of mercy than live in the imprisonment of your
hell,” Haedus served the men an unpleasant taste of what was to come.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1372803403.0,,,True,t3_1hiwxf,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1hiwxf/prologue_for_book_one_of_feign_the_praestigiae/,

During the summer, I wrote 50/180 pages of book one, and then I stopped. I just didn't want to anymore, so I stopped. Right when my momentum should have been massively picking up because I know where everything is going to go and I laid down a solid foundation.

I think I became afraid of writing becoming... real. I'm highly risk-averse in my life, and I don't do things that set me up for potential disappointment or failure. I prefer safe, normal days to having high highs and low lows.

I really think the book I was writing was good. I received positive feedback, including from strangers on the internet (ha!). It is going after a profitable market where there is nothing like it yet but where it obviously fits market trends.

But I don't particularly want to write it. I don't feel I have much to gain, personally, for writing it. I will be comfortable enough in my normal career.

But then I feel that, since I can, I have a sort of moral obligation to do so, because it is a waste to not.

I don't know if anyone can relate, has ever been in a situation. Basically things got a little too real and I wussed out. I also worry that I'm just at a low in my personal life, so I lost motivation. I don't know. I remember being SUPER excited about it, imagining my future as a successful author. I just can't really imagine that anymore.

Help?

I have been meaning to write something for a long time, but I've been terrified to put proverbial pen to paper for fear of creating something which doesn't stand up to my own criticism. However, I finally managed to come up with a substantial enough idea to write a short story, which I hope you enjoy. I had a lot of themes and threads in my mind when I wrote this and polished this, and I'm not sure if I made them obvious enough - I'm also not sure if it's obvious enough what exactly happens at the end, but I decided to err on the side of caution with this so as not to detract from the semi-first-person narrative, and the feeling of being caught up in the protagonist's view of the world.
__________________________________________________________

**Green Tomatoes [by Ed Lawes]**

The smell of salt and the distant cries of seagulls cut through the creaks and groans of a small house settling in the wind. At the end of its garden a woman stepped out from inside a faded greenhouse. The soles of her wellington boots became caked in wet, yellow grass and loamy mud as she walked through the grey weather back up to the house, pausing to inspect the few scattered flowers still braving the murky end of summer, then using the edge of the concrete paving outside the porch to wipe the muck off her boots.

“I wish you’d stop doing that,” he said as she stepped in the door.

“Stop what?”

“Stop watering those damn tomatoes. It’s nearly September. They’re not going to ripen now. Let them wither.”

She sighed and shook her head, hanging her coat up on the door and turning away from him to walk to the kitchen. “You don’t know that. This weather can’t last forever.”

He said nothing, returning to his paper. It hadn’t always been like this. In Glasgow, they’d had a full crop of tomatoes every year they planted them. Here, the sea breezes and the salty soil stopped anything he planted from growing much, instead producing a pitifully small harvest or simply dying. The vegetable patch he had dug when they first arrived had long since grown over, and the fruit cage was cracked and had rusted to a deep brown colour, its bare metal stung by the salty wind. He never had been much of a horticulturist, and it was too late to start.

She walked back in from the kitchen. “I’m off out to my pottery class. I’ll make sure to pick up some more eggs and milk on the way back. Oh – and Stuart and Patricia called; they’d love to have us over for dinner sometime. I thought that would be a lovely idea.” She waited for a response. “Frank?”

“Oh. Yes. I’m sure that would be fine.” 

“I’ll call them then. I do wish you’d stop leaving the paper lying on the chair like that – you know how the ink rubs off on the fabric, and it’s such a pain to clean.”

He lifted the pages a few inches upwards.

“Thank you. I’ll be back in an hour.”

She had always wanted to retire to a bigger house than this. Living here, perched on the edge of the sea in a small bungalow, was not the dream they had dreamt. She had wanted to live in a big house further south – in the country, but near the city, so she could keep in touch with her many friends. They had wanted somewhere with plenty of space for their children and their families to visit. That was no longer an issue: their son had not been a part of their lives since he left to go to university abroad, and the annual Christmas cards, a cordial formality, had ceased arriving several years ago. He didn’t know anything about his only child. It was his own fault – if only he’d spent more time with him – with both of them – and less time working, perhaps… But it was far too late to change it now. There was barely enough time left to mourn these things.

She’s so frail now. She shuffles around slowly, wispy grey hair almost floating above her head, with her big, beautiful brown eyes now drooping and watery. They blink back at him with a mournful sadness. There used to be so much life in those eyes. He could stare at them for what felt like hours, losing himself in her, before the tinkle of her laugh cut through his reverie as she blushed, unable to bear the intensity of his gaze. Then he would kiss her and hold her and they would be together and that would be all they needed.

Outside, the rain began to fall, and the drumming of the droplets on the thin metal roof cut through the heavy silence of the room. The dark fence bucked and swayed in the wind, and he could see white breakers rushing towards the shore across the simmering grey sea. He knew that this was how it ended. He sighed heavily. This wasn’t right. He had worked in the city, dreaming new ideas for new companies in new offices, their employees living in new houses. It was exciting, it was fresh, and it was free. He gets home after work to a loving wife who kisses him on the cheek, and his son, first a new-born, then a baby, then a toddler who trots merrily up to greet him. He is bright and curious, asking questions that become more eloquent as he ages at what seems like a tremendous rate. The house is small, but with beautiful red-bricked walls and a narrow, green garden with roses growing up a trellis on the back wall. They talk together late at night of moving into the suburbs with the hushed excitement of those who believe – those who know – that their lives can only continue to improve.

He got up and stood for a moment standing in front of the window, gazing out at the broiling ocean, trying to determine where the waves ended and the sky began. Then his breath clouded the glass and the image faded. The rain began to quieten as he turned away, the sound replaced by the scratching of his breathing and the muffled thudding of his laboured footsteps. He put the kettle on. Last week he had glimpsed her crying in the bedroom, sitting on his side of the bed. She must have left the door open so he would see her there – so he would come and console her and fix what was broken and right the wrongs he had done her. But although he was sure she heard his rasping breaths behind her, he did and said nothing. He knew she could no longer stand him. He knew that the reason she retreated to the greenhouse every afternoon was just to be away from him, to have some respite from his presence. She used to leap adoringly into his arms. Now, he had become the failure he hated, and he knew she despised him for it. Only a curious sense of duty and an illusion of integrity kept her from leaving.

The kettle came to the boil, and he started pouring the water into the two mugs as the door clicked open. You open the cupboard. You take it out, you put it in. This is what you must do. His hands shook as he carried the mugs through to the sitting room.

“I’m back. Tea? Perfect timing!” She smiled, and her wrinkled face creased even more around the eyes. “I noticed the paint on the side of the house is going – we need to sort that out before winter,” she said, sitting down.

“Nobody can see it,” he muttered. He lowered himself into his armchair, brushing the paper to the floor. She pretended not to see where it had been resting, but lowered her eyes and exhaled. She took a sip of the tea.

And now it’s winter in Glasgow, and they’re looking up at the house, red brick fresh and new, a light dusting of snow topping the roof and windowsills, and her holding onto his arm as they stare at it, not quite ready yet to open the door with the key they’ve been given and call it theirs. She holds a little tighter. This is not yet the dream, but this is where it starts. He looks at her and she turns to look back. “Thank you,” she whispers, and that is enough. 

He sees her across the dance floor, and their eyes do not meet as if in a fairy tale love story, but he can’t help but go and talk to her, and they dance and they laugh and they leave at the end of the evening and sit in his car overlooking the city like the cliché he never thought was real and she looks at him and he knows she’ll always be there now he’s found her, that she’ll never leave so long as he loves her enough, and he promises to her then that he’ll never stop loving her, that he’ll give her the life she wants if he can be a part of that life. And that is how it began.

She leaned in to look at him and stare into his eyes as her eyes grew wide, sparkling and dancing as they flicked back and forth between his. He knew then that she understood. She never could find the right words when he showed her affection, but now they didn’t need words. He knew she understood. She finally saw how much she really meant to him; after all these years of being unable to give her what she needed, and watching as he let her beauty slowly turn into a frail shadow of its former self, he was finally making amends. A small cough escaped her mouth as she fell forwards. He moved off the chair onto his knees to catch her and clutched her to his chest. He stroked her thin hair with his trembling hand, and a tear rolled down his cheek. This was what she wanted, and this was what she deserved. 

He can hear both their heartbeats. They merge and separate in long, twisting rhythms, dancing a spiralling dance around each other. Hers slows and fades. She is leaving now. Her brown eyes stare, fully round, back into his. Her mouth is a perfect O. She brings her arm up to touch his face, her hand shaking, and he touches it to his cheek. It begins to grow cold. 

He knows he can never redeem his failure in the past to give her the love he promised. In so many ways has he failed her. But now, now he has given her the freedom and the escape he knows they both crave, maybe… maybe she could see now. Maybe she could understand.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1371659302.0,,,True,t3_1gnvl9,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1gnvl9/feedback_green_tomatoes_1688/,

David awakes in a bed in his small apartment. Looking over he sees Rebecca sleeping next to him. He thinks to himself “Uhh I can’t believe this happened...again.I know this should stop. Why can’t I stop? I know Samantha could be my future, but with Rebecca things are just...uncomplicated.” He stares at a picture of Samantha on his phone while Rebecca sleeps.

As they begin to talk about their previous night togethcer, Rebecca notices a long strand of hair in the bed that belongs to neither David nor her. After questioning him if it belonged to another girl (it did) and Davids prompt denial, she says that she hopes he is only seeing her and that she feels its time they turn their relationship from casual fun to something serious. David doesn’t know what to do or say, as he searches for the right words, a loud knock is heard on the door. David and Rebecca freeze. Another knock is heard. “David it’s me, are you there, we need to talk.” resounds from the doorframe. It’s Samantha. He hears the doorknob begin to move, it seems she has a key. David immediately jumps up and shuts the door and links the chain that connects the door to the wall. “I’ll be there in a second!” he says nervously. Rebecca asks “what is going on?” and he comes up with an excuse telling her its his landlord or crazy neighbor or something. He tells Rebecca that she should go take a shower, while he handles this. She enters the bathroom.

David opens the door to Samantha, and she storms in furious at him for him shutting the door on her earlier. He begs her to be quiet, hoping Rebecca doesn’t hear. The turning on of the shower is heard from afar. This and his odd behavior puzzles Samantha and David being so quick on his feet said that it’s a friend, or maybe a client from his job who slept over. He makes up an excuse and tells her they can talk outside. She’s not buying it, she thinks something is odd but complies anyway.
Samantha is upset, saying she tried to reach him all last night but he didn’t respond. She tells him he’s been so distant lately and she wants to know why. She reminds him that if they’re ever going to get married they have to communicate. David is annoyed. It’s these kind of commitment expectations that drove him to Rebecca in the first place. Before he has a chance to respond, Samantha adds “and well David, I think I’m pregnant. I came here because I want you to go to the doctor with me”.
We then find out Rebecca has been watching from the view in the door this whole time. The camera is back to David and Samantha but then the door opens. Rebecca is in center frame between David and Samantha.
“Hi, who are you? What are you doing with my boyfriend?”
Samantha is confused and obviously angry. David stumbles with words. He has no idea what to say. His instincts are to lie, as he’s done nothing but lie to these women for the last few months. He eventually comes clean to both women. They’re obviously upset and leave. He returns to his room, alone to wallow in self-pity and guilt. He once had two girls, but couldn’t decide what he wanted and because of that he’s now left with nothing.

A few months pass, Samantha is pregnant, and he pays for the doctor visits but that’s the extent of their relationship, she hasn’t forgiven him, even though he wants to be in her life. We learn this from a text he receives one night, reminding him of the next appointment occurring the following morning. David is seated at a bar, when an obviously intoxicated women comes onto him, seductively asking him to come home with her. He denies her advances, informing her that he has somewhere important to be in the morning.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1fu4zk,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1fu4zk/feedback_short_film_treatment_drama/,

Walters was always vexing Abrams by the way he talked. Always stating the obvious while he worked. It was starting to get to him.  He tried to ignore Walters while he refocused. The meditation techniques they taught in medical school or surgical residency came easily enough. But sometimes the interface he had to wrestle with, mainly due to external factors. In his mind's eye he imagined himself connecting to the robotic arm once again. Somewhere, deep is his brain; the software responsible for processing his thoughts into actions was mistranslating. The arm that A could see on projection was not his. It failed to obey him.
 
He was getting frustrated. He felt like he needed a vacation. Saturn was a popular spot this time of year. Liners would head out almost every week.
 
Again he tried to clear his mind, pushing away the stressful presence of Walters and replacing it with what he imagined the Rings looked like up close. A moment of inner tranquility achieved, he regained control of the robotic arm. The cutting began. 
 
Not so hard. Let the blade do the work.
 
Again. He already knew that. Think of the Rings. The arm was his once more and blade traveled.
 
Alright just keep cutting, this is already taking longer than it should have.
 
Think of the Rings.
 
Advances in medical science did nothing for this guy. Never took his medication. Tragic. 
 
Rings again.
 
Ok. Good job. Just pack it with the surgi-foam and let’s wrap this up. Which bed was he in?

The chart says its 4D. Are you sure?
 
Of course he was sure. Again with the questions. 
 
Its LaSalle. Neuropathy. Right foot amputation
 
Chart says this is Moyer. Liver resection.
 
His stomach tightened to a degree he did not think possible when he looked away from the monitors and at the face of his patient. His mistake glared brighter then the lamps suspended above the severed foot. He stared as the machine arm applied the foam in steady, consistent movements. 
 
Never seen you so pale before Abrams. I'll call Dallas to come up here and reattach that. This isn't going to be good for your malpractice though.

The cold steel pierced through the warrior’s chest. He gasped, blood spurting from his lips. He felt the blade twist inside him. His eyes widened as he felt death approach. He heard a soft whisper behind his left ear. “Nothing personal… just business…” The sword was pulled from his torso roughly, and he buckled in the high grass.

“Well, that was unpleasant,” the teen mumbled as he stood up and wiped the blood from his steel. He paced about ten feet away, surveying the area. He could see no one. At least this time nobody had noticed. He scowled, lifted his hand up, and signed the letter S. There was a quiet rustling from a nearby tree, and a man suddenly dropped down onto a branch. 

“There ya go, Shizuki-kun! You’re getting better every time!” the shadowy man laughed and applauded.  “I knew it was an excellent idea to take you in, eh?” The assassin dropped from the tree and strode over to his apprentice. Shizuki looked at him with a mix of amusement and disdain. “I suppose so. But what other choice did you have, sensei? Leave a poor defenseless child to die?” 

The assassin laughed, and put a hand on Shizuki’s shoulder. “You’re always so sarcastic, Shizu. And by the way, there’s no need to call me sensei all the time.” Shizuki smirked. “Yeah, I kind of keep forgetting that you actually have a name…  Sousuke.”  Sousuke brushed his long hair out of his eyes and smiled his devilish grin. He pulled his hood up and rolled the body over. Sousuke rummaged about in the dead man’s pocket for a moment, before pulling out a small pendant. 

“Alright Shizu, I found the amulet. Let’s get out of here before anyone comes along.” Shizuki took the small pendant from his master and stowed it in his hip pouch. He glanced over at his teacher, currently sitting under a tree. “Now we have to go back to Aizure, right? For our reward money?” Sousuke looked over and nodded. He slowly stood up, stretched, and began walking north. The student followed close behind, thoughts of food and money dominating his head.

His eyes shone as he looked at me, blue as the ocean. He always had blue eyes, said the voice in my head. People often marveled at the way that he looked at me. His name is Bain, and he is the love of my life. He has always protected me. Everytime I touched his lightly tanned skin, I saw black eyes and whip marks, and I didn’t know why. He was the light in my darkness, and he had always taken care of me. I went to touch his face, but he burst into fire. with a noiseless scream on his handsome face and then suddenly, he disappeared in front of my eyes. I shot up in bed, I was covered in sweat and breathing heavily. I looked around me, thankful to be in my bed. I had had the same recurring dream for the last two weeks, with the same results. I did not know who this, “Bain”, was, but for some reason he was important.

This sublime recognition temps what is to be, and not be; what is, and what is not; how we are, and are not. Over the course of life, time will eat you alive. You're cornered by nature's inevitable cycle of growth and decay, unmatched by the nature of ourselves. You're trapped by a string of existence, a tangent line brushing against arbitrary points and qualified by the test of time; existence's only value lasts in it's duration through the rhetorical power of expressions in our idealized history. What is life, what is time, and what's it worth to you?

You perpetually move forward, headlong to an undisclosed destination that you can never expect. You shift from playground to classroom to office to tombstone, all while gallantly cascading through the stepping stones of time. Watch the path as it narrows and winds, look back to see the long years of your life, then look forward and know what is waiting for you. Days become weeks become months become years becoming and going til they all slide by as if they had somewhere to be. They wait for no one, especially you, as the hands keep on turning and the tide keeps on rolling in. Where does the time go, where were you when it was here? 

Time goes nowhere you haven't been. It sits, moving yet still, watching you from afar. It strokes its beard and pulls the smoke from its pipe, content with its unwavering stare. Meanwhile you divide it up, marking it left and right, figuring out how to spend it. You sell it like a commodity and then wait for it when you have no more left. You breathe it in and spit it out when you've used it up, taking it for granted. It doesn't care though, because what are you, to it? Just another short lived fly, fluttering in fading undulations.

Is time alive? Can time think and feel? What does it mean to truly live? Can you see it, the albescent void of nothingness? Can you touch the air around you, even if it has no form? Can you hear idle words, if they have no meaning? Can you even know what time is?

Time is every moment you've ever lived up to now – everything you've ever done or said, happened at one time. Time is 12pm through 12am that one time all those years ago on your birthday, and each year subsequently. Time is the scars on your body, the wrinkles on your hand. Time is August 30th, 1984 when U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery takes off on its maiden voyage. Time is the Gregorian calender, the hourglass, the lunar cycle, and the seasons. 

Time is the frame of everything around us, everything that life has been and ever will be.

The time you have is a blessing.

The time you've lost is a curse.

You live to die and die to live, all in one fell swoop of existence. You live, growing physically, growing mentally. You expand and develop, teaming with an aura of sentience in everything you do. You stabilize, your actions become habits and your habits become your life, unfolding in unavoidable circumstance. You wait, bracing yourself for the inevitable collapse of your own ruin. You die, decaying physically, decaying mentally. You wrinkle and devolve, shrinking into the creases of your skin, left to be.

It's the supposed time limit which makes life so precious. Life without death isn't life at all. This value of life creates a value of self, and self is everything. You are a tangent sequence of telomeres dividing and multiplying into a universe of the unknown. You are a line with unlimited possibilities and existences, only you have to realize it.

The world is spinning. You look up and see everyone else, they're perfectly fine, just living their lives. This isn't true. What you see is the in between of life, the footsteps taking you to and from the corners of living. At one point these people tried to live, now they just try to survive. You realize that time stops for no one. We're swarmed by a wave of bullshit, dictating what can and cannot be, surrounded by an endless pressure to conform. Cut your hair short, put on makeup, take your pills, make money pay taxes.

And all this time, time ticks slowly by, biding its time while you waste yours. 

Someone at my school got hit by a fucking car. Someone I knew overdosed alone in their apartment. Someone I met took a bullet in the chest in Afghanistan and never came back. Someone I saw hung themselves out of desperation. Someone's Grandfather just died, leaving their Grandmother in a daze.

Their family, their friends are breaking down. 

and here we are, sitting on time, reading papers, listening to music, pissed over something so trivial but right now it seems so important. Time is the devourer of all things, it flies and ends unexpectedly, even though it continues on without you. Life is the time you hold closest to you. Your life makes up this time through the will of the surface values of your conscious mind. Live your life, live your time, live your mind, the way it was meant to.

Colors flickers and bend, geometric patters morph by predetermined twists of your hand; infinite amount of parallel words spawn before your eyes as they follow through and through the looking glass of your own life.

Shapes form, fractals conjoin and strike each other in an aesthetic pulp of glitter and bright serrated shards, spinning, shaving lines; stars and stripes of lesser known variants.  Quadrants collide and equally divide with a total loss of identity, yet remaining the same, fresh smorgasbords of prisms of spatial deformity. Miscellaneous homogeneous landscapes spanning eras of time, one forgetting the other. Lights shines around the corners, leaking in from the hazed backing of sight, a murky reminder of an alternative world waiting on the other side. 

Tangible swirls of uniform color fades as shapes cascade against each other, compiling across a transverse beam of white; empty and pure, like frost surrendering to spring. Symmetrical structures of active design rise, motion weld in occurrence. Limbs sprawl and grab at the edges of the universe, tugging at the fabric of reality, nevertheless trapped by the boundaries of limit.

People bash to and fro as they swarm from assorted clusters of buildings and domiciles, passing and reverting back into each other without resistance. Polycephic Paleozoic creatures with a sixth sense of connectivity, conducting reflective actions and trivial pursuits. The glazed reality of the kaleidoscope mirrors the world outside it. 

Individuality streams from seams of littered fabric as they are live and return to the tapestry of life. Live and breathe, if you believe these to be real things. Monitor your breath as your chest pumps oxygen into your lungs and cycles it throughout the organs of your body. Feel the blood rush to your heart and then back out. Feel your skin on your bones. Every part of these feelings are you, they are your existence. Not just your existence but everyone else's as a single homogenized lump of human clay. The person next to you, your parents, government officials, what makes their existence any different than yours. You are all part of the same inevitable reality of perception, spinning on a rock within a prism of the universe.

This leaves you to wonder, what is reality? What is your reality? Perhaps you are an idea floating on a thought of someone else's mind. Perhaps a dream on the periphery of a wide ocean of existence. Close your eyes for a moment and think about what's inside your own head. Darkness. A black void reliant on synapses and impulses. A motor box tightly humming to circuitry of your nervous system. A thready wisp of smoke inside the filament of your own soul. 

Leave the phantom hourglass that is life and see for yourself what lies in the parallel darkness.

Color interacts with surrounding light, altering the first color. Warm light from the sun, cool light from the sky, cordial reflected light bouncing off other objects; what you see may not be what you perceive. The nature of existence is reliant on the ability to perceive physical objects. All things and experiences are impermanent within your own conditioned phenomena.   

Everything is in a constant flux, constantly changing; coming into being and ceasing to be. Since nothing lasts, there is no inherent or fixed nature to any object or experience. Your attachment to your reality is fleeting, which leaves you to the connection of your mind. Your mind is filled with bad abstraction. Tangents that go off into nowhere, bad habits of repeating yourself and deja vu. The locus of your being is the communicative event of the language that you use. What you feel, what you think and do comprise your own reality, yet the reality in your mind is formed by the mere awareness of conscious thought. Language shapes the thought process into questioning the inexhaustible meaning of being; you project self as your body, your hands, your legs, your eyes. These respective parts only physically comprise yourself due to your reliance on the fleshly realm. But what about the things that can't be seen that you know to be there? You know that electricity is real, anger, hatred, love, the wind – yet you can't see any of them. The ideas of space and time are constructed by man, so whats to say matter is just another facade of reality? You can reproduce matter on the television, even see it again in your mind. 

You're a product of genes and adopted stance. You are a idea-replicator producing itself in a new host. You are the traditional concern with the truth of ideas and beliefs. A tangible mass of protein strings. An out of body experience. A phantom in the shade.  

Tryptonauts, face the Memetic reversal of your very being, and plunge yourselves between the fibers of what is and isn't. Dip below the shallow ends of consciousness and sink to the depths of imagination and psychedelic phenomenon. Disintegrate from the apparent illusion of perceived boundaries and feel the universe press upon your skin in an elaborate fabrication of Buddhism, Mysticism, Gnosticism, Monism, whatever you like. Then come down to the awakening sensation intrinsically embedded in the human psyche: where the false version of our true selves no longer serve itself; look at things as they are, as we are, a multiconscious trip cascading through the cosmos.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1cwq5w,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1cwq5w/the_tangible_concept_of_reality/,

My one night with Annetta this week had to be P.T.A. night. My least favorite night as a kid and still my least favorite night as an adult.

Gently rub the sides of your cheeks in a counter-clockwise motion. Separate your teeth. Unclench your jaw. Let it all melt away. This is three weeks and five paychecks’ worth of muscle relaxation therapy at work. Stress reduction therapy, what the nurses called biofeedback.

On the walls are posters full of primary colors, letters of the alphabet, shapes, and messy handprints of all the kids. These are the only worthwhile distractions in the room besides the wood building blocks in the back, and those are strictly off-limits until recess. Little Annetta drifts in and out of consciousness, her head rests on my leg. 

You can only stare at pink piglets and yellow bananas and basic arithmetic for so long before all you can see is red. My mouth is a vice.

Simon Costen sits crossed-legged on the foamy carpet and follows hand spaceships that whiz through his little pair of trainer specs. Simon’s carbon-copy of a father balances his boney ass on one of the doll-sized plastic chairs they gave us to sit on. His wiry frame shoots up like a rod straight to an undeniably formidable moustache. On a bad day.

The man’s eyes are like his son’s, swirling pools of blue that stare through a pair of seeing glasses. The only difference is Craig’s specs are not plastic or the soft shade of periwinkle little Simon sports. Instead they are reflective and straight and boxy with perfect angles and straight lines. Complete with a very classy, sparkling gold rim. His eyes aren’t following any bitching spacecraft either. That’s the other difference. It’s more like the Columbia disaster in there. Not a pretty sight for me or old Craig Costen.

Julia Hodgekins pounds the carpet.

I glance over, and it’s like frustrated single dads everywhere have this mental connection or something, I swear. He looks at me and nods his narrow head up and down. Yeah, he mouths. Fuck this, I’m out. The man grabs little Simon’s flying hand, and lifts him off the ground like a crane. Simon’s legs just hang there, his eyes still gaze into outer space and the bottoms of his sneakers blink.

Our decrepit captor shoots those two glassy cataract-speckled eyes straight at Mr. Costen, my hero for the night.

“Excuse me,” she croaks out. Costen freezes. This terrible woman’s throat is just like a fossilized turkey wattle. And I mean just as swollen fleshy and just as veiny red. “I’m continuing on. Please sit.” She says, barking. My eyes circle the room and I force back a smirk. Like I said, I was already losing it. This little scene is pushing me over the edge of social sanctity. Everybody is trained in on Craig, anticipating his next move. Simon just hangs there.

And Craig Costen, like a god, unlocks from his statue-like pose and walks right out the door with his kid dangling from the one arm, all without making a single sound. He completely stonewalled it. This man is a rock. An urban legend. Put him and that legendary ‘stache on a calendar for a life-altering contest immediately.

Ms. Milburn lets out something like a forced wheeze.

Craig Costen, boy, do I owe you one.

Inspired, I stand up tall. With drowsy little Annetta curled in my arms I turn to the door of classroom 1A, my chest swelling with courage and man-dignity. A few turgid chest hairs practically poke through my sweater.

“Absolutely not,” the teacher says, booming through the thin, moveable walls of the miniature classroom. I freeze, just like Craig did. This is the edge of a wall to the other side. You peek over, just to see how far of a fall down it is. You either suck it up and jump or you back out, crawl down, and accept the same-old.

Everyone watches me, just like they watched Craig Costen in the same moment of tension he so graciously handled. The deal is, if I leave, everyone else gets to leave. These are the stakes we’re dealing with here. Craig walking out, that wasn’t enough. Because now he’s just the parent who isn’t getting with the program. But hell, if I walk out of here like this? That pulls the plug. A dam of social anxiety erupts and we all get to float freely back to our homes, far away from the awful Ms. Milburn and another chapter of the Boxcar Children.

Craig Costen was a martyr. And I won’t soon forget his sacrifice. But tonight Craig Costen, I dropped the ball. I failed you.

Tonight, I was the domino that did not fall.

My body crumbles into a heap of embarrassed and pathetic defeat back onto the orange baby chair. Annetta cradled in my arms, she fakes sleep to spare me any further soul-crushing demoralization like a good girl.

Sofia Marcel’s mother twists her plump and tan and pretty face into a grimace towards me. Nice going, slick. Her husband Rex looks over his wife’s dainty shoulder at me and laughs. My jaw winds up like a spool and teeth grit together like jammed machinery. And I swear I hear a faint pop somewhere in there. But the surgeons said some pops were normal. 

Pops are okay. Clicks you need to watch out for.

“Continuing on,” the terrible Ms. Milburn says. More like declares, to all of us. She clears her throat and the wrinkled neck flab jiggles and then is still again. “Chapter twelve,” and she flicks the page.

The walls shook, causing all thought to flee from her mind. She struggled to her feet, only to the floor shift beneath her feet, sending her crashing to the ground again. Pain flared from her shoulder and she cried out, the sound immediately drowned by an explosion. Mortar and dust filled the room and she heard the walls or ceiling crack.

“Help!” she shouted and found the effort of calling out painful as well. When she sucked in breath, she coughed, gagging on the dust and another, courser vapor that quickly filled the room. The room plunged into complete darkness and she screamed for help again and again.

She didn’t know how long she lay there in the dark, screaming and gasping and coughing, but in time hands touched her. They pressed gently against her throat and she heard muffled voices, barely understood. Those hands turned her over and she saw faces, horrid faces of metal and plastic with large, black eyes and round canisters that made a metallic sucking sound.

Then one of them removed his face, revealing a boy’s face. He leaned close to her, bright, focused light illuminating him from the side. She saw large, dark eyes and shaggy, dark hair that was matted with sweat and something else. He spoke and she recognized him as the boy she’d seen in her room before. The memory felt like a lifetime ago.

“We’re being attacked, put this on!” he said and then hands were handling her again, pulling her to a seated position. Something rubbery and cold was shoved over her head and even the bright light dimmed. Then, quite suddenly, she could see. The room became washed in pale, green light and there was a low hum in her ears. Every time she took a breath, it was accompanied by that metallic sucking sound.

The mask, helmet, or whatever it was tightened on her head and she was pulled to her feet. The boy wrapped his arm around her waist and took her own arm around his shoulder. He wasn’t wearing a mask anymore but followed the others out of a gaping hole in the wall without missing a step.

“Where are we going! What is going on!” she shouted, but her voice sounded tinny and distant. No one answered her. She passed through room after room, each one looking similar to the one she’d woken up in, only some with more beds or other blocky shapes she couldn’t distinguish. Desks or perhaps dressing stations.

Every so often bright lights flashed by in the distant, white and yellow and red, like lines of light flaring briefly to life before dying away again moments later. They passed groundlings lying on the ground, some with caved skulls while others had great lacerations and punctures through their bodies. In time, Aderyn put together that they were wounds made by ether-lances and ether-blades. The look was too similar to what she’d seen in vids about Wars.

“Be glad you aren’t going little sister,” Kendrick told her once when she was sullen about being left behind. “War is a stupid, messy business that serves no purpose beyond the ending of an equally messy argument.”

*Kendrick is dead*, she thought, the image of his exploded body pushing its way into her mind. *And the argument goes on.*

And then they were outside and Aderyn saw the star-filled sky dominated by the gas giant of Querra, its great red mass turned green by the mask. Mountains rose on all sides of her, great daggers of darkness that seemed all too much like teeth, swallowing them as they pushed into a forest’s edge.

Her legs gave out soon after and she fell, catching herself at the last moment with one arm that twisted painfully beneath her. She ripped the mask from her face, feeling suffocated it. The air that greeted her was cold and fresh and good. She breathed it in deeply.

The boy was at her side, a hand gentle on her arm. “We need to keep going, just a little further.”

“Leave the little spit!” another voice called, female. “Let them have her!”

“She’s one of us,” the boy called. “You saw her back! There’s no Tell!”

“Mara’s blood,” the female voice said, and Aderyn saw a tall shadow come to her side and she was pulled roughly to her knees. The pain in her shoulder flared and she screamed. A hand struck her across the cheek. “Shut up!”

“Leave off!” the boy shouted and shoved the other woman back. He took Aderyn’s hand in one of his and then used his shoulder to gently guide her to her feet again. “Don’t make me remind you where you came from, Ksenia!”

“Sure nowhere as soft as this spitting kitten.”

“Can you move?” the boy said, and Aderyn realized he was talking to her. She nodded, her head swimming and she suddenly felt sick. “Wait… no…” she said and heaved, the meager contents in her stomach splashing against the grass at her feet. She tasted nothing but water and bile.

“Come on,” he said. “You can do it, just a little further.”

“Yes,” she said, leaning against him. “Yes, all right.”

She didn’t know how long they moved through the forest, but she eventually became aware that they were not alone. She counted nearly twenty or thirty groundlings tread through the wood with them. In the distance she heard something else, something she knew instantly.

“Steeds,” she whispered. “And… and a ship…”

“Just a little further,” the boy said, his voice unsteady. “Just keep going.”

A high-pitched whine filled her ears and the woods exploded with light. She covered her eyes with an arm and she heard shouts of pain and surprise spring up all around her. A horrible wind kicked up, blowing her hair in every direction and making a roar in her ears. A ship, she thought. There’s a ship.

“Get down!”

The boy grabbed her and pressed her into the wet grass just as a steed ripped past her head, the rider igniting his ether-blade as he turned the vehicle around. The boy pulled something off his hip. It looked like metal and plastic and glowed in places. His hands gripped it around the back and a finger squeezed tightly just before a beam of white-hot ether energy shot out from its tip. The beam appeared, connecting the device and the knight aboard his steed for a heartbeat, then it was gone and the knight was thrown backward off the his vehicle, screaming.

“Don’t have too many of those left, come on!” he said and took Aderyn’s hand again. She was too stunned, too shaken by what she’d seen to do anything but follow. They ran without a direction, crossing back and forth, hiding briefly before moving again. Aderyn quickly lost track of where they were, of which direction was forward or back. Above all she was tired, weary to the point of collapse when the boy finally pulled her into a dark hole in the ground.

He urged her into it first, following after and pulling down a screen of leaves and grass. Aderyn wasn’t sure how far down the whole was, being on an angle but she didn’t ask any questions. Instead she curled up and pressed her face into the ground, mud and dirt smearing across her cheek and forehead. She wanted to weep, to cry out in anguish and fear but instead she shook in silence.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1bljp0,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1bljp0/the_blood_part_8_serialized_space_opera_novella/,

Draft 2 -WIP - FINISHED/Edit in progress


The throne room was massive. From the 20 meter doors, the laid tiles directed to an incredible row of stairs, each step a different material from all corners of the globe. On top sat a golden armless throne, mined from gold deposits in the vacuum of space. The surrounding floor held immense slabs of patterned stones, leading to topaz lined granite walls, and a vertical garden mid-height of exotic plants which grew to the roof a hundred meters high. In the throne sat a man of legend. His legs planted firmly, he dawned a suit of silk and cotton, a neatly wrapped black tie, and a beaver fur cape attached to arctic wolf shoulders. Clipped to his hair and ear on right, a pin of pearls, his symbol of rule. 


///Scenes Of Power///

i

A fire roared behind the throne, along with several beasts. All thought tamed, surprise filled the court as a cheetah stood, approached The Empirate, and growled a slow, building snare. Rising from his throne he looked on in fascination of the angry animal. ""Ambitious?"" he spoke, standing ever firm. The court guards rushed immediately to the figures, and lifted their weapons awaiting an order or sudden action. ""Stand down."" he spoke again, now leaning nearer slowly putting his hand out for the large cat to sense. In a moment, it snapped forward with its fangs, and bit at The Empirate, catching only an arm. ""Stand down!"" he yelled as he pushed his arm harder into the gripping teeth of the cheetah. He took his free arm and grabbed its throat, causing the jaws to loosen, and its paws clawed swinging at him. Pushing the cat to the ground, he placed his knees on the cheetah's pits and squeezed harder on its throat, immobilizing its half, leaving only kicking legs and growls. The beast slowed, and died. ""Hell take you"" The Empirate whispered, bleeding now alarmingly from his shredded wrist. Guards rushed to him once more, offering rejected help up, and surrounded him back on the throne. A medic rushed to his side, cleaning and stitching his arm there. ""Let any species challenge our dominance,"" he announced to the court. ""and let them fail.""

ii

Sitting in his throne, The Empirate stared at his garden in the empty court. The Doors shut, a draft enters the open sunroof swirling around the large room. The night weighs heavy on the scene, with the ambushing moonlight bringing light to all the exposed gems. He feels the weight of the world, the hard choices and his past, always present. ""Pride."" he mumbles to himself. ""I have to move on, I cannot falter."" A separate light fills the night sky, along with roars in the background rippling the air and the ground shook subtly. He stands, straightens his clothes, and begins to descend the steps, taking note of each's beauty. A colossal sword posed on his back, slanted with a long hilt in right arms each, strapped heavily around his left shoulder, and stretching long off just off the ground. As he walked the sword held steady moving with him without resistance. At The Doors he placed a hand on each and pushed, a job normally requiring two men, releasing himself from the prison he spent now days in. Another round of lights, and he swallowed, bracing, moving forward.

iii

The Empirate stood on the capitol house's back porch with a drink in hand; In front of him his two kids play with new toys. His eldest, a girl of 10 who had a plastic sword in her hand, bashing at her cowering younger brother's shield. The stained glass doors behind him opened, and a beautiful woman stepped outside with the guards around the porch respectfully nodding to her. She wore her blonde hair up in a pony tail, which wrapped around her neck and draped over her right shoulder. Her black blouse had scales of gold patterned diagonally from her right down to the adjacent hip and black frilled bottom. She matched it with a simple thin black skirt, and a posture worthy of a statue. Walking over to The Empirate, she kissed him on the cheek, brushed a hair back, and sat in the empty chair beside him. ""Should I prepare the funeral feast for my child?"" she whipped, leaning her head in the direction of the children. ""Let them be."" The Empirate laughed. ""God knows shes the only one who isn't afraid to take on my son. It's good for him."" The breeze picked up and the scent of fresh grass and the nearby lemon trees made the scene. Taking another sip, he rose to stretched. ""Life is good to us now,"" he continued, ""but if he doesn't toughen up the challenges ahead might be too much."" His wife sighed. ""Just enjoy the day"" she annoyingly exclaimed as she reached over, took his drink from hand and refreshed. ""We're not whiskey.""

iv

An explosion ruptured the capitol center's outer walls. Hundreds of guards rushed to the square and approached the battle ready Empirate on one knee. ""Sir!"" one spoke, with decorated armor and bloody boots. ""Christouxphr is falling. This isn't a matter of right, or politics, but fact. If we don't head for the tunnels you will die."" The Empirate stared at the man, familiar with his battle experience all too well, and nodded. ""Then take the tunnels, and meet with my family with the reserves. They're hours from approach, so I don't expect finding them will be hard. Take the white and be safe."" Standing, the guard protested. ""Sir! None of us will leave without you. The artillery will stop and the capitol will be rushed. There is no tact here, no goal but a senseless death of our ruler!"" Knowing his place, he keeled again in apology. More explosions break the sky and shattering rock follow as a thunderesque shadow. ""Fine."" The Empirate conceded. ""My city can be ripped apart, the people slaughtered and our defenses crushed but it will not fall by enemy hands."" Looking at his watch, he releases a deep breath and straightens himself. ""Send men to rig the palace to blow. When they finish, lower the art room to the bunker and order them to surrender come the invasion."" The guard looked pleased and ordered as he said. The Empirate turned and began his retreat. ""Goodbye, Christouxphr."" he whispered solemnly.

v

""This is it."" a man spoke, in a clean, modest suit. His tie, a sky blue compliment to his black and white. A flag pin rested slightly slanted on his left breast. As he walked his wife held his hand, their shoes click the tiles and a chill runs down his spine as he starts to hear the crowed echoing from the balcony opening. ""You can always change your mind"" she jokes, ""we could go get lunch or something instead."" He laughs. ""Don't temp me, that's a 'me' thing to do."" She stops him just before walking out, and places a hand on his cheek. ""I love you, and you're going to be great. A short speech, shake the mans hand, and try not to laugh. That's all you need to remember."" The mans smile was all the reply he gave before turning and walking out into the light. Cheers roared as man at the podium announced, ""Ladies and Gentleman, The President of the United States.""",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_18wj5d,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/18wj5d/crit_scenes_of_power_anachronic_historical/,

Often, when something interesting happens to me, or an interesting question pops into my head, my first impulse is to write about it. But really, I've only just started to approach writing as a skill that I need to work on.

So, here is one of my first attempts. I thought that using lyrics from cool songs as writing prompts would be a good exercise, and this one was inspired by City and Colour's ""Grand Optimist"". So check it out and let me know what you think. All criticism is welcome, and remember, I'm only just starting out!

[Here's](http://gdtthoughtsandmusings.blogspot.com/2013/02/poor-pessimist.html) a link to my blog if you're interested.

----------

A shattered femur, torn knee ligaments, a fractured shin. My leg didn't even hurt until after the doctors had pieced it back together. I can't remember the last time I had a good night's sleep. But that's okay, in a way. Nowadays, my dreams aren't anything like they are supposed to be. Everything has changed.

Life is full of problems. I think that how we deal with them has a lot to do with how we got to wherever we were when they reared their ugly heads. How we were brought up. We're all the products of everything--every person, place, and thing--that came before us. And I'm certainly no exception.

My mother is a disciplinarian and a hard worker. Has been all her life. Her solution to getting slapped in the face isn't to turn the other cheek. No, her solution is to mutter something vile under your breath and punch the slapper square in the face. And then, when you've done that, tell anyone that will listen what you've done. Life is a struggle for my mother. And only the meanest, scrappiest warriors can win.

When I was younger, about seven I would say, she lost her job. Laid off amidst widespread economic turmoil. She got home and took to punching walls and throwing drinking glasses. Shouting obscenities that would have made Quentin Tarantino plug his ears. I knew that she was tough, but I'd never seen her like this. It was frightening. But the next day, she decided to do something about her situation. She put on her best business suit, swooped me up, and took us downtown. I was actually pretty excited. She had always been so busy that we rarely got a chance to visit the city. But the skyline was beautiful. Few things are more wondrous to a small child than a collection of buildings hundreds of times of times taller than he is. But I digress.

My mother went into every building that had a door, armed with numerous copies of her resume, and told whoever was in charge that she would do any job available to her. A few hours and several city blocks later, and she had probably submitted at least a couple dozen resumes. And all of her hard work and rushing around paid off. She had another job within a week, performing clerical duties for a local hospital. She was even getting paid more than she was at her previous job. ""You see son, life's a bitch,"" she said. ""But you've just got to be ready to be a bitch right back at it.""

They say that opposites attract, and I guess it must be true. My father was nothing like my mother. He was very religious; he read his Bible for at least an hour every day, and prayed almost constantly. ""God will never put more on you than you can bear,"" he would tell me. ""Life isn't hard when you've got Him on your side. A good prayer can fix anything and everything. But you have to trust God. That is the way."" I guess it worked for him. He was never in a bad mood, and good things always happened to him. And even when bad things did eventually come his way, he would suffer them almost happily. He was the grand optimist to my mother's poor pessimist.

He managed to float his way into a position as the CFO of a local insurance company. The fast life of a corporate executive must have made our meager lifestyle seem dull by comparison. I suspect that he just got bored of me and my mother. Soon, he would fall in love with one of his coworkers and move away with her to Europe. The fast life, indeed.

So what do I do when faced with the bitchiness of life? Well, it just so happens that I've recently been dealt a pretty shitty hand. I was on the football team at my university. And I'd really been making a name for myself. I already held all of the school's major rushing records, and highlights of my games were often showed on TV. The pundits and commentators all seemed to think that I was very talented. Maybe the best running back in the country. That, if I kept my pace, I definitely had a future in the NFL.

I couldn't keep the pace, as it turns out.

One day, about six weeks ago, I was riding high. We were playing our crosstown rivals, and I was on pace to break my own single-game rushing record. And then, a crushing blow from a linebacker changed everything. Until that play in the third quarter, I had a future. But that future is just dust now. Wondering what could have been...it keeps me up at night. Eats at me until there is hardly anything left to gnaw on. But my mother is always there to keep me grounded.

The doctors say that someday, after some rigorous rehab, I should be able to walk again without much issue. But as far as a career in football...well, I can kiss that goodbye. If my father were still around, he would probably tell me that everything happens for a reason. That I just need to accept what has happened and pray that God will show me where to go from here. And for the first couple weeks of my recovery, I did just that. I prayed my ass off, hoping that I would hear something.

But all of that prayer brought no solace. I gained no strength from counting the beads on my rosary. No, my only instinct now is to fight. To go through my rehab and to become strong like I was. I've seen many players come back from gruesome injuries. And I can too. The desire to silence my doubters consumes me. I have one question for my father: who but God could have done this to me? No matter. I'll show Him. I've never been very devout, but I would gladly sit in His lap now if it got me any closer to being able to punch Him right in the nose.

It seemed pointless to lie there wondering about what hell was going to be like.  It’s like a kid on Christmas Eve who won’t go to bed because he’s too excited about all the over hyped bullshit that he’s going to open the next morning.  He lies awake minute after agonizing minute wishing the night would end so he can terrorize his parents out of bed at an ungodly hour and break into a slew of toys that will entertain him for all of ten minutes.   All the while, if the little shit would just calm down and go to sleep, his morning could be here faster than he could say Merry Fucking Christmas.   But as they say it’s easier to see the fault in others than it is in yourself.  It was about thirty minutes ago when I finished my shot and let the razor takes its first dance across the frail skin that packaged all those tantalizing arteries and tendons within my wrist.  Thirty minutes and all I had done from twenty nine of those was daydream about what my next few infinities in hell were gonna be like.   Would I be greeted like some fabled hero for all the messed up shit that I so openly welcomed into my heart and soul or would I be on the top of chart for demons bidding on who they wanted to personally torture, because let’s face it, who would a demon like to peel the skin off more than a once was priest who turned homicidal on those assholes who deserved it the most.  
	Twenty nine minutes wasted, wondering about stupid shit that if I would just close my eyes and let go of this miserable feeling called life could be my present instead of my future as soon as now.  Just like a boy on Christmas Eve who couldn’t wait to see what Santa brought him,  I lie in my tub, blood flowing, temper flaring,  fists clenched eagerly waiting to open my eyes and see Satan himself licking his chops in anticipation.   I shake with anticipation knowing that soon I can look into his eyes and tell him exactly what I’ve said to all those I’ve killed in the last three months.   
“MY NAME IS CONNOR MCCARTHY AND I’M ABOUT TO RUIN YOUR FUCKING DAY. “
	If there is one thing that hindsight has taught me, it’s that death is a whole lot like life.  Nothing ever goes according to plan A. When I was finally able to force the last lazy breath from my pudgy, balding, middle aged shell there was no burning river of fire piloted by Hell’s very own swamp people.  Instead one minute I’m watching my rubber ducky make lazy laps around my blood filled bathtub.  The next I’m staring down a dirty shot glass in some dive bar where the only thing screaming torture is the overinflated prices they’re charging for a beer.   Well that and the waitress, she looked a bit sinful too. 
Ask anyone who knew me back in my living days what my weaknesses were and depending on which version of me they knew, you’d get two very separate but very long lists of answers.  Those who knew me in my early days, my post-seminary days would tell you I was too trusting, too honest, and too naïve to the real state of the world around me.  Ask those who got the displeasure of knowing me after I witnessed my sisters murder on the steps of that church and you’ll be told of a man whose anger ruled his life, whose hatred had no boundaries.    To read each list would be like reading the failures of two different men because I had in fact led two very distinct lives.   There would be on similarity between them however, on either list anyone who ever knew me could easily tell you that I was a sucker for any woman with a pretty smile and/or a low cut shirt.  The waitress had both. 
Petite yet powerful is the simplest way for me to describe the waitress whose name tag read Llorona. A vision of black hair, brown skin, hard where you wanted, soft and supple where it counted.  She was your prototypical Latin beauty. 	 But it wasn’t her Latin “assets” that had drawn me in; there was something about her eyes.   Her body, her posture, her very presence screamed control and power.  An essence that nothing could shake her, like she had seen more and understood more than anyone else around her.  Her eyes however betrayed her.  Slightly glassy and rimmed with a red hue that no amount of makeup could cover, she showed a distinct weariness. I couldn’t tell for sure but it looked like she had either just finished crying or was just about to start. 
	“Excuse me, ma’am.  Could you tell me where in the hell I am?”  My voice was raspy and dry.  I felt like I’d swallowed a bucket full of sand.  
	“You’re not.”  She never even looked at me while she spoke; she merely continued serving up shot for the other patrons at the counter.  Some of which looked just as lost and confused as I felt on the inside. I’d be damned if I were gonna let it show though. 
“I’m not……what?” 
She made her way back towards me, locking those pained brown eyes on mine.  Stopping to refill the wicked green drink of the douche seated to my left.  He looked neither scared nor confused. He looked rather amused if anything.
	“You’re not anywhere in hell.  Not yet at least, but I’ve seen your sheet, shouldn’t be too long before you find your way there.”  She finished making her rounds and stopped right in front of me.   “For now though, you are right where you’re supposed to be.  You died and now you await your judgment.”   She grabbed a shot glass from under that bar, mixed together any number of different spirits so fast that I couldn’t even begin to guess what was in it and set it in front of me.   The result was a hard red drink with a single gold drop floating through the middle.   It was the exact same drink she had served everyone else.  Apparently it was the special of the day.   
	“Not much of a selection around here is there?  How bout you swap mine out for a beer instead.”  I was a sucker for girls but my momma had always raised me on the whole don’t eat or drink things that a stranger puts in front of you philosophy.   
	“This isn’t your place to make choices mijo.  You’ve already made your choices.   The drink just weighs them out and delivers you to your new home.  This isn’t your world anymore.”  She spun my glass around to face me.  I hadn’t seen the print before she poured the drink but now it stared me right in the face.  
Welcome to Purgatory, Connor.   One last drink before you fly or fry

					          Chapter 1 
					Armor, swords, and spells
	
	A boy with the name of Airon is in a deep slumber in his bed when his mother ,Sheri, starts trying to wake him up.
	“Airon...Airon...GET UP!!! yells Sheri. 
	“What time is it?” asks Airon rather tiredly.
	“Almost noon.”
	“Almost noon!” at this point he is wide a wake and totally freaking out. “I'm late meeting Bart at the forge!!”
	“No you're not.” says Sheri. “It's your fourteenth  birthday. Remember? Now get out of bed and get dressed.”
	
	Let me tell you a little bit about Airon. His hair is dark brown and curly but he keeps it short, his eyes are a light brown color but almost look bronze. His build is short, and he is strong and swift. His friends gave him a nickname, Hawk, because he has hawk like vision.

	   Airon had just finished getting dressed and walked to the dining room sit down and eat breakfast.
	“Good morning mother. Good morning father.” said Airon.
	“Good morning” said Sheri and his dad,  Cordo. 
	“Here are you presents.” said Sheri. “Sorry we didn't wrap them”
	Airon took the present to inspect them
	“Armor, a sword, spell scrolls? Are you losing your minds!?” asked Airon “This stuff is illegal!”
	“We figured you might need these” said Cordo “ Oh, and here is a backpack. I enchanted it to hold an unlimited amount of items and the armor can transform in to any type of clothing all you have to say is armor then a clothing.”
	 “Um what type of sword is this?” asked Airon
	“Obsidian iron. It's unbreakable you know.” said Cordo. “and the armor is dragon scale but it can change in to lite dragon bone armor, its the most flexible”
	“Great.” Said Airon, in an extremely sarcastic tone “not only do I have a sword but dragon armor if the empire finds out it will be the death of everyone in the town.”
	“Not if you turn the armor into a cloak and put your sword under it.” Said Sheri.
	Airon sighs “I need to go for a walk.” Says he and walks out the door.















						Chapter 2
	
	Airon wandered around the town for a while bought some dried fruit, deer jerky, a couple of  sleeping bags, and fire making equipment.  As he was walking he decided to go to his girlfriend's house.  When Airon arrived he knocked on the door, no answer, he knock louder, still no answer.  He backed away from the door and charged, suddenly the door flew open in front of him WHACK everything went dark.
	When Airon woke up his head was throbbing with pain. 
	“I'm so so sorry!” said Airon's girlfriend, Abigail, in a worried voice.
	“I..it's ok. I'm...fine...don’t worry. Why did you hit me any way?” 
	“I thought you a soldier.” said Abigail.
	“ Why? 
	“ because it's collection week.”
	“I totally forgot.”
 	“How do you forget?”
	“I think you knocked it out as me....... hahahaha”
Airon pulled out a scroll
	“What is that? And why do you have a backpack?” asked Abigail.
	“It's a healing spell. As for your second question I'm skipping town. Are you willing to come?”
	“Ok. I was going to leave any way.” 
	“When were you going to tell me?”
	“Just now”
	“What was that?” asked Airon
	
	There was clanking of weapons and armor “lets check this house.” said a man.
	“We need to hide!” said Airon.

	They ran to the fireplace and climbed as fast as they could. The door fell from a kick and the soldiers searched the room. 
	“check the fire place.” said someone.
 	
	A man looked up the chimney. No one was there.

	As soon as Airon and Abigail jumped off the roof they started running, they ran to the edge of town and stopped to get a bow and arrow for Abigail.
	“Wher ya you two youngsters a goin?” asked the stall keeper, Dirk.
	“To Misty Spark Falls.” said Airon.
	“aright” said Dirk.
	
	They walked  to the edge of town and took a right on a fork in the road when Abigail said	“I thought we were going to the falls.”  
	“we're not I told him that so if anyone asked he would say that.” said Airon.
	“Oh. I didn't think of that”
	“I could tell...I could tell.” laughed Airon.

	Let me interrupt the story real quick I just want to tell you what Abigail looks like. She is blonde with startling ocean blue eyes and her build is sleek, curvy and sinewy yet strong muscles. All in all she is very cute yet fierce.
	A few minutes after they left the town the group of guards that were looking for them asked Dirk where they went and he said they went to the falls.
	“Sure they did.” said a guard. As they walked away
	“What should we do Captain?” asked Roldfier, the First Lieutenant.
	“Go to the fields.” said Captain Valneir. “ Everybody move out.”
	“How do you know captain?” asked a guard.
Valneir drew his sword as he spun around and loped the guards head off
	“Does everyone understand? We follow those kids and no one, I mean no one asks questions.” Said Valneir.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1359141409.0,,,True,t3_179qud,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/179qud/here_is_the_first_few_chapters_that_i_have/,

Tops of buildings lost to the fog. The cityscape was punctuated here and there with roads.  The roads almost barren. The fog reached out to the forest on the edge of town. The forest was almost completely shrouded by the fog. The tops of trees disappeared in the fog. The dense forest was split only by the occasional road. Roads were just asphalt brushstrokes in a sea of rolling trees. Almost barren.  However in this expanse of trees and fog a car was being driven by a young woman. The inside of the car is fairly worn out. Some tears in the fabric of the seats. The dashboard was lightly covered in dust excluding several spots where someone had hastily tried to clean it with their arm but gave up soon after. Two people were in the car. The aforementioned young woman and a man seemingly sound asleep in the passengers seat.

""Are you awake? How can you drive such a piece of shit.? Jacob are you up?"" asked the young woman.
""I am now thanks."" Replied Jacob as he rubbed his eyes. He looks outside at the passing scenery.
""How can you sleep?""
""I close my eyes.""
""Real funny Jake.""
""This isn't the first time I've done this you know.""
""I know, I know but like don't you ever think about what you're doing? Doesn't it bother you?""
""Nope clean conscience. Where are we anyways?""
""How can you have a clean conscience when you're lying to people?""
""I'm not lying to people. Where are we?"" responds Jacob as he takes out a glasses case from a jacket pocket. He opens it and looks at the dark rimmed sunglasses inside the case.
""Well if it's not lying then what is it? Just taking advantage of people by pretending to be something your not? You walk around with your can and take advantage of people's generosity.""
Jacob takes the sunglasses out of the case then puts them on.
""Lying implies that I am stating something that is not true. I never walk around and tell people that I'm a blind man. They just assume it.""
""You know what I mean. It's being dishonest.""
""I can live with that. You still haven't told me where we are.""
""You can live with it but still. It doesn't seem right. Doesn't seem ethical in any way. Don't you have a job? I can think of better ways of making money.""
""Yeah that's great. How far are we from the city anyways?""
""You're not even listening. Why don't you go pretend to be deaf too?""
""I wish I was deaf right now.""
""Real fucking hilarious Jacob. Why did I even agree to drive your sorry ass.""
""Jesus are you on your period or something.""
""Fucking shit Jacob, you know just because I try to take an interest in your little fucked up social experiments in morality doesn't mean I'm on my period.""
""Christ I'm sorry. And I had a job but I got fired.
""Thank you."" The young woman sighed. ""So why did they fire you?"" asked the young woman.
""I dunno. I guess they thought they could do better. I don't blame them. Anyways where are we? You still haven't answered.""
""Why can't you hold on to a job? And we're a couple minutes from the bride into the city. Hard to tell. Are you doing this because you need income or something? There's nothing wrong with welfare you know. I can ask my dad to lend you some cash. I'm sure he wouldn't mind since he's known you forever.""
""I'm not taking any money from your family.""
""Why not? You seem to have no problem taking money from strangers. You walk around pretending to be blind and take just let people give you money. I want to know why you're doing this.""
""I won't take money from you guys because you've helped me out enough.""
""Then what is it Jacob? You know I care. Just tell me.""
""What does it matter why I do things? Just drop it already. Please. Look we're here at the bridge just let me off here"" The car slows to a stop. Fog covers the bridge at the halfway point. The other side remains hidden.
""It matters because I want to know why I'm driving you to another city so you can take advantage of people.""
A silence enters the car. It seeps in from the windows and from the dashboard. It fills the car with a hesitation that doesn't speak. Jacob looks outside.
""No one ever gives two shits about me. People hardly give two shits about themselves.""
""So what you just do it so people care about you?""
""No, its. No it's not that. It's just nice.""
""What's nice?"" said the young woman
""Seeing people being nice to each other. People feel better about themselves when they help others. ""
""So you just want to be treated nicely for once. Listen if this is about the psychologists you should know that I'm here to listen if you-""
""Goodbye Lucy"" said Jacob. ""No need to be a saint for me."" He leaves the car wearing the dark rimmed sunglasses and holding a tin can. 
""No wait I'm sorry! I didn't mean to bring that up! I didn't mean to upset you! Please!""

But with the top down and wind blowing through their hair, nothing could have be a better start to the weekend. Gwen cranked the music louder to muffle Olivia’s singing.
	
“What? It’s not that bad.” Olivia continued belting out lyrics. “Well, shake it up, baby... (shake it up, baby).”
	
“Twist and shout... (twist and shout),” Gwen couldn’t resist joining in. Olivia’s positivity was infectious. “How much longer do we have?”
	
Olivia looked down at her phone and brought up the map. The blue line traced the path to their weekend. “Without traffic I’d say less than an hour till we hit the first Key.”
	
“Yessssss!”  Gwen, she stomped her feet, stuck a hand out of the jeep and shouted, “Freedom!” 
	
“I know. We’ve put this off for too long.” Oliva
shook out her hair. It was a poor attempt to stop it from smacking her in the face. “Gwen, we need gas.”
	
“No we don’t. I filled up ten minutes ago.”  She looked at the gauge just to be sure. It was early, but there was no doubt in her mind that she could have just stuck in the pump and forgot to do anything.
	
“Uh, yeah you do.” Olivia pointed over to the convoy of soldiers pulling off to the gas station. “Ten bucks they’re Navy.” 
	
“Oh, you’re so on.” Gwen let off the gas and pulled behind the trucks. 

What could be wrong with a little flirting? Both girls were single and on vacation. The sun started to rise giving them a welcoming warmth that the early morning was missing. The girls traded their sweaters for sunglasses and finally found hair ties at the bottom of their beach bag. Gwen took the final sip of her coffee and was glad to have a reason to go inside and spark up a conversation. 

The coffee smelled fresh which was rare for a turnpike rest stop. Olivia raided the chips trying her best not to stare at the two men browsing the candy bars. Gwen couldn’t believe how her best friend could go from a shy, reserved, librarian to acting like a boy crazed sixteen-year-old.

“Shit.” Gwen let the coffee overflow burning her hand. She stuck the burnt part into her mouth and went looking for ice.

“Don’t put ice on it.” The warning came from a deep voice behind her.

Gwen froze thinking her mishap had gone unnoticed. The last thing she wanted was for a cute guy to see her sucking on her hand after burning herself.
 
“It’ll blister quicker. Try warm water or soy sauce.” 

She released her hand and winced. “I’ll be sure to keep that in mind next time I try to cook.”

“Or pour coffee?” He smirked. 

*Aren't we a smart ass.* She forgave him. He was being helpful and those greens eyes made it easy to forget the burn. 

He looked around the convenience store before asking. “You two making this trip by yourselves?”
	
“Yeah. We’re big girls. I think we can handle it.” Gwen couldn’t help but grin. He was gorgeous. “Why do you think otherwise, Mister... Cifone?”
	
“Officer.” His cocky but he was good at it. “Of course I do. There are pirates in these parts. Why else do you think they are calling the Navy down here.”
	
Gwen laughed at him. “Well if my ship gets boarded and plundered, I’ll be sure to call out for you.”
	
“I’m sure you’d be what they’re plundering.” He couldn’t keep a straight face. “We’re all on leave if you ladies are making it all the way down to the tip. We’d sure love for you to join us.”
	
“That could be fun.” Gwen stuck out her hand. “I’m Gwen.”
	
He looked at her hand and saw it was still red. He gently took it in his and kissed it. “I’m Lance.”
	
“Oh, no he didn’t!” Olivia blurted from the cash rep.
	
Olivia watched the two exchange numbers. Gwen had to drag Olivia from the convenience store. When they got in the car Gwen handed Olivia a ten. Olivia was able to keep silent until they hit 80. 
	
She finally blurted out, “Please tell me what I witnessed was real.” Her mouth hung wide open.
	
“You might want to close your mouth,” Gwen said, trying to change the subject. “You could swallow a bug.” 
	
“No really? Did a guy name Lance really just kiss a girl named Gwen on her hand?” For the twenty years they had known each other, Olivia had made this her life goal. “You have to marry him!”
	
“You’re crazy. And no matter what story you read she never marries Lancelot.” She saw Olivia’s smile fade. “Don’t I have to find Arthur first anyways?”
	
“No, because everyone knows that Lancelot is the better looking of the two.” Olivia yawned and laid her chair back. “Hopefully, one of his round table members is just as hot.” 
	
Olivia slept the rest of the way to Key West and missed out on the few times Gwen pulled over to take pictures of houses on stilts. The seven mile bridge gave way to open skies and blue waters that made Gwen want to pull over and jump into the ocean. There would be time for that during the week. 

Gwen tried to wake Olivia when they went through Sugarloaf key but the girl continued sleeping. Even sleeping through her own photo shoot with a Key deer. One came right up to the parked Jeep and sniffed Olivia’s dangling hand. 

	The Jeep chugged down the road past places that could have been anywhere but the keys. Those fancy postcards only told part of the story. It was refreshing to see normality in a vacation spot. They passed through where the townies lived and into post card Key West. Bright colors blinded Olivia as she opened her eyes.	
	
“We’re here?” She sounded a bit surprised. 

“Of course we are. What did you think I was doing while you were playing sleeping beauty?”  As Gwen pulled into the driveway of the bed and breakfast her phone buzzed.
	
“Ah! Let me read.” Olivia sntached it up before Gwen  could react. “Hi, beautiful. Us sailors are getting settled in. Why don’t you and your friend meet us for lunch?”
	
“So I’m guessing he has a friend or two for you,” Gwen said, yanking her phone back. “No more reading my messages.”
	
Olivia rolled her eyes. She started shoving all her stuff she thrown around the jeep into her overnight bag. “Yeah, like that is ever going to happen.” 
	
Two full size beds with white and baby blue quilts and matching towel animals awaited them behind the door. Gwen claimed the bed closest to the sliding glass door. “Olivia you have to see this.”
 
Both girls gaped at the view. Their room was only a few drunken skips away from the ocean. The sand and blue water was just what they were needing to recharge with. 

Gwen was delighted with her last minute hotel choice. “How cute is this?”

“Are you sure the animals aren’t going to miss you while you're gone?” Olivia was already out of her sweatpants and shirt and into a bikini with a bright pink cover up. 

“There are other caretakers for the otters.” Gwen hadn’t even thought about changing. She was perfectly content with stepping out on the balcony and taking a nice nap on the hammock. “Pretty sure I’ll miss them more.”

“Not if you‘re distracted.” Olivia waved Gwen’s phone in front of her.

“How did you? Seriously are you a magician?” Gwen was certain she had her cell in her back pocket.

“You dropped it when you put your bag down. And since when have you cared about me touching your phone? What are you hiding?” She lifted her right brow half expecting Gwen to dive for the phone. But there was nothing more than a shrug from her.

“If you want to ruin your surprise go right away. But don’t come crying to me saying how you couldn’t wait.” It was easy to bait Olivia. The two had known each other for twenty-three out of their twenty-seven years of life. “Go ahead. Look if you must.”

Olivia stood with her mouth open looking at the phone not knowing what to do. She blinked a few times waiting for see if Gwen was lying. But there was nothing. Moving faster than she expected herself to she snatched a business card off the desk and ran into the bathroom with the card and phone. Gwen rushed over and pounded on the door but there was nothing she could do about it now.

Yes, I've been hunting for an agent. After 50+ agents and only three that showed mild initial interest I've begun to wonder if this might not be the right path.

Some have done great, others have done good, and some have fallen by the side of the road. Might I just have to prove myself first before being accepted into the hallowed halls of traditional book publishing?

From my high perch in the old oak tree, I look down into the valley far below. The trees are a deep and verdant green, but soon they will change to their fall colors. The river flows but only sluggishly, a thin layer of fog lingers on it's nearly placid surface. A light breeze moves through the trees and I detect the ripple of leaves as it moves across the face of the forest. 

Near the base of the oak I spy two squirrels as they chase each other around and around the trunk of the tree. They eventually work their way upwards as the game continues. Finally the leader runs along a branch and in a great leap that seems almost preternatural, it is suddenly in an adjacent tree. It scampers away and is gone.

The squirrel that had been following is now left behind. It starts chattering in that nervous way that squirrels do. The creature almost seems unhappy the chase has ended. 

I briefly ponder the meaning. Were they friends playing a game? Was it a territorial conflict? I shall never know the reason. 

I spread my wings as the sun climbs over the bluffs, shaking the dew from my feathers.

Down on the bank of the river, a lone white tailed deer approaches the water. She looks around, and after making sure nothing is approaching that might threaten her, she lowers her head to drink. She raises her head from time to time, just to make sure her situation remains unchanged and that she is still alone.

After drinking her fill she turns, and in one great sudden leap disappears back into the forest.

The sun has warmed me sufficiently now, my feathers have dried from their night time dampness. I stretch my body and wings, sensing all is ready.

I launch myself from the branch, catching the air with my wings and soar over the valley. I follow the river for a while until the land climbs towards the bluffs. Great limestone battlements guard the river here.

Below, near the mud flats, a raccoon daintily washes it's tiny paws in the river. It looks up at me, and is suddenly gone. 

I wheel in the sky as I spot a group of crows. They will be looking for trouble. I have no time for them this morning. I have other business to attend to.

I dive to increase my speed, leaving them behind for the moment. As I reach the trees on the opposite bank from the limestone bluffs, I swoop upwards and pump my powerful wings. Finally I level out, riding the wind. Soaring high over the pastures, I am now in my hunting ground.

Time passes. How much I cannot say. The rush of the wind, the feeling of flight, sensing the world around me. Time is time. It simply is.

A moment later, or perhaps a lifetime, I spy prey. Down in the fields below a mouse scampers across the bare expanse of closely cropped grass. There is no place for it to hide before I can take it. The mouse knows this, yet still it tries.

I have to admire the mouse for this. It fights to survive, as we all do in whatever way is available to us. The sudden realization hits me. It is our struggle that defines us.

Diving, I extend my talons towards the doomed mouse. 

Suddenly something intrudes. A buzzing. Some outside sound I cannot ignore.

My hand slaps the alarm clock off and I sit up in bed, pushing the blankets down towards my feet. I rub the sleep from my eyes and look at the clock. 

I think for a moment of my dream. Knowing that for just an instant, I knew the joy of flight. 

I remember my epiphany as I rise from bed. I stand there a moment pondering it. 

I go forth, to continue *my own* struggle.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_10pjzc,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/10pjzc/early_riser/,

Thoughts and constructive criticism maybe?",RoflCharger,6,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/10jxpd/i_started_this_as_a_senior_project_but_now_im/,"So, as I said, I started this novel as a project for a senior requirement. I had not gone through a lot before my senior year was over, but I had a lot. This is the most I've written because I would just write short stories or stop working after sometime. This one however is different, and I thought I might share and excerpt.

Basic summary, this novel is based off of The Divine Comedy by Dante with a bit of Supernatural and other media references. A young man named Eran (I like to spell names weirdly), who was living a crappy, near poverty life dies. He then finds himself in the hands of the Angel of Death, who tells him that he has been sentenced to Hell, but it was a mistake. They then seek God, who tells them that there is going to be another rebellion in Heaven. Eran must go through Hell, Purgatory and then Heaven to find out who is behind this rebellion, and along the way, finds out some interesting things about his own life before his death. Anyway, here's a piece from the second chapter. (Forgive the length of this post.)

-The crushing darkness. The endless abyss. I stood there, no. Maybe I lay there. It was too dark. Or maybe I was blind. My senses failed me, this illusion was overwhelming. Is this the afterlife? Is this what happens when you die? I feared that the rest of eternity would be spent wandering this dark plain. My immortal soul forever trapped in this, this place. Maybe I got about 2 minutes of wandering and thinking, then bright. A bright light appeared in front of me. At least it was bright to me, who had not been able to see anything in this darkness. Before me what looked like a portal appeared. A figure appeared to me, and reached out to me. And it called to me. No, not physically, though. I felt it call me, mentally. I began to walk forward. My hand reached out to make contact. As I got closer, I felt a force pulling me slightly. I reached into the portal, and poked my finger through. Then I felt something pull me. I was getting sucked in and I tried to resist. I tried my best, but the force was too strong for me. I then pushed myself even harder to free myself. I felt my arm coming back to me, and then a skeletal hand came out and grabbed my face. The bones so rough, and held so tight. They reeked of decay and death. It pulled me in and I went through. I landed on the floor, and hit it hard. It wasn't painful really, but I felt my self slam into the ground enough to make me grunt. I then positioned myself to all fours, then got up to my knees. I looked around and I saw. I saw home. My apartment that is. And everything around it. But all was dark. No light coming from any building, or anywhere. Only one streetlight was on. The one I was positioned on. Then as I got up and continued to look, the light across from me turned on. It flickered as I stared into the darkness behind it. I felt a presence beyond that light. I knew there was someone about to enter that light, and make their presence known. I wasn't really prepared for who might enter the light. But then that same hand from before appeared and pointed to me. And I heard a voice call to me. 

“Eran...” The voice sounded old, and eerie. I noticed as the hand then gestured that I come closer. I did accordingly, and began to walk closer at a cautious pace. As I exited the perimeter of my light and it shut off. When I turned back around the hand was no longer there to gesture me. Then as I stepped into the perimeter of that light, the voice spoke to me. “Far enough.” I stopped and stood. I then wanted to know what was going on. So I decided to speak.


“How do you know my name? What is this place?” I began to adjust to the darkness around me, and I saw the silhouette of the figure. He was quite large, maybe 6 almost 7 feet tall. He was slim though, not too big and beefy. He appeared to be wearing a cloak and holding a large staff. Then he began to enter the light. Slowly but surely I saw the parts that entered. His hands, both made of bone. Then his arms, covered in black sleeves. As the rest of him appeared, I noticed his dark robe covered in bones, but they were formed into some kind of armor. And then his staff, a long bone staff. It was made of a long spinal cord and then I look as light reflected off the top. This was no staff, for what the light was reflecting was a curved blade at the top. Then the head, a hood shrouding a face in darkness. The complete picture, was the Grim Reaper. I backed up, and turned around because I wanted to run, but then all ground around us not covered in light collapsed into a dark abyss.  


“Tsk, tsk. Eran, you should know that from me, there would be no escape.” I turned to face him once again. I was terrified. I should've expected him, but I just thought that the Grim Reaper was just a myth. “Yes, Eran. I exist. Don't be surprised.” Whoa, that was weird. It was almost as if he were... He spoke again. “I know what you're thinking Eran, because after all the souls that have thought the same, I've grown accustomed to people debating on my existence. I am the Angel of Death. And I've come to take you to your eternal resting place.” I stood surprised, and then more ground appeared behind me. And at the edge, appeared a doorway. An entrance, with a sign. I looked closer, and it read, “Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.” I stood confused and then I realized something. I recognized that sign. I remember those words. Yes, I do remember.


It was 10th grade English class. I remember that class so well. The teacher, so comic. She wasn't afraid to tell some interesting stories of her past relationships and school experiences. And she really liked me as a student. We even hung out on some occasions. Those were good times. I think she was one of the best teachers I've had. I remember the class room. It was tiny, and we had so many students. So many students, like 30 or so. Everyone liked the teacher, so everyone would sign up for her class. I signed up because a few of my friends were in it. Yeah, we had good times in that class, too. I remember when we were free writing, me and my friends would always finish our assignments first, and the teacher would let us leave class to chill. Those were the days we would leave school to go get something to eat. We would go to a Burger King, or McDonald's. They were within walking distance of our school. I would always order a chicken sandwich with mayonnaise and lettuce. My best friend, Charlie would always get a double cheeseburger. Then we'd get back to school on time for lunch and we'd just hang and not have to worry about waiting in line for lunch, or about the crappy food they would serve. Man, that food was crappy. 
	    

But, I remembered one assignment, we had to read a novel of some sort. My mom suggested that I read “The Divine Comedy” by Dante Alighieri. At the time she was with my 1st stepfather. He was a religious man of sorts. I remember all the little details. Yeah, I remember. The first part, Inferno. Where Dante travels through Hell. Then it hit me. It hit me harder than if two trains were to crash into each other with me in between. In Dante's Inferno, the entrance to Hell had a sign that said the same things as this one. My eyes widened and I shouted:
	    

“NO! No, I don't want to go to Hell. I'm not going to Hell! This can't be right!” Death stood there and watched my pleas with a blank expression since I couldn't see his face.
	    

“Unfortunately Eran, this is where you were sentenced.”
	    

“There must be a mistake! I have done nothing wrong in my life! Nothing that would put me here! Give me a chance to make it up!” I pleaded more than ever. I knew I had done nothing wrong. I have done nothing wrong. I have not committed any major sin.
	    

“It's out of my control, Eran. I am simply your guide.”
	    

“Who's decision is it then? Allow me to speak to whoever it is!” Death stood. He lifted his hand and pointed up. I felt confused but I knew who what he was gesturing. Rather, who he was gesturing to.
	    

“It is God. He decides. No mortal soul may see him, especially one that is damned.” I almost wanted to cry. I would've cried, but I feel that in Death's presence, crying wouldn't help at all. 
	    

“Then what? I will forever be cursed to Hell unjustly? God knows all, and I acknowledge this. But why would he sentence an innocent soul to Hell?” At that point Death looked down. He then looked up, and back to me. I knew that he was confused. He is an Angel, and he should know about me. He does know about me. “Just give me a chance.” He then looked at the entrance and to me again.
	    

“I may not speak against God's will. But I may give you a chance. I will accompany you through Limbo, the first circle of Hell. There we will find Minos. He is the judge of the damned. He reads your sin, and sends you to the appropriate circle of Hell. If he finds no sin on you, there is a possibility that you may escape that ill fate in the Inferno.” I felt relieved. At the same time I felt scared. In order to escape going to Hell, I had to enter.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1348869742.0,,,True,t3_10jxpd,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/10jxpd/i_started_this_as_a_senior_project_but_now_im/,

Let me know what you think!",aWOLtrooper,8,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/zv66q/looking_to_thrust_my_life_into_writing/,"The music was loud, the alcohol was bitter, and the women just looked… Tired. All around the club creatures of all shapes and sizes were sinning to their hearts’ content; whispering sweet nothings, some in exotic tongues or even vocal grunts, in the ears of waitresses in the hopes of finally seeing the rooms in the back- and all of their slutty splendor. Others came on business, swapping their cargo for cash or making plans for other devious scandals. The bartender eyed the club carefully, scouring its nooks and crannies methodically. He didn’t care about the dirty dealings or the outlaws that frequented his establishment- as long as they paid [and they did, often handsomely so] he turned a blind-eye to their business. There was something about tonight that just didn’t feel right.

Bos-Bos had survived many a shootout and none of them by chance. He started working at the Red Chimera when he was just a pup, his shaggy fur still silver with boyish innocence as he bussed tables and cleaned dishes during the club’s daytime hours. Back then he wasn’t old enough to work the night shifts- which he was fine with, he decided, when he saw the types of clientele the club attracted after dark. But when the bartender was caught in the middle of a hail of blaster fire one night, Bos-Bos was promoted. There he was, now thirty years later, still cleaning the same tall, frosted glasses that he had polished day after day. Over the years, he served fruity drinks to politicians looking to escape their high life and find their release, or foamy, frothy concoctions to outlaws wanted in twelve systems, out of breath and sweaty from avoiding the sirens and strobe lights of the police, and on many occasion the stiff, vaporous shot to mercenaries, slave traders, and shady men on ‘business’. But the man who walked into his club just then was the most mysterious of them all. He knew something wasn’t right.

Wearing a long, brown coat with the collar up high and a matching wide-brimmed hat the tall lanky character sauntered up to the bar and took a stool a few feet away from Bos-Bos. As the stranger’s overcoat hung to the floor, the barkeep saw the telltale metallic flicker of an energy pistol in his leather belt, which wasn’t uncommon in this system. Regulations on personal firearms were practically thrown out the window as soon one descended the towers to the lower districts, where the club was located. Men of all species took the law into their own hands down here, and like an old wild west movie, shootouts were more common than handshakes. What caught Bos’ eye was the obsidian-black of the gun’s long, smooth barrel which contrasted greatly with the pearly white of it’s handle, an ornately carved material- probably bone or some type of soft stone- with a design he couldn’t quite make out. He set down his glass and walked over to the man, who had his head hung low and hidden by the long brim of his hat.

“What’ll you have?” Bos barked in his native tongue, a common language of barks, howls and growls known as Kaetish. An odd scent wafted towards his sensitive nostrils, a scent he couldn’t quite describe.

“Information.” The stranger barked back fluently, which was rare for anyone who wasn’t a Kaetite, like Bos-Bos. Unlike Bos though, there was a heavy, synthetic quality in the voice, like an android or computerized voice. The foreigner lifted his head and stared straight into Bos’ eyes. Bos finally got a good look at his face- rather, whatever there was left to see after he noticed the electronic-looking fabric wrapped around his neck and lower face, which blipped and blinked with a mind of its own. Bos had seen devices like this before, often used to mask someone’s voice, or even modified to translate languages. This one, however, seemed to have a different purpose- a medical purpose if he had to guess from the burns that covered his left cheek, and a deep set of scars, as if from a mighty set of claws, cascading down the right side of his long, slender face, leaving him only one good eye with a robotic implant for the other.

“Sorry pal, I don’t serve that here.” Bos woofed and turned around. He knew first hand not to get involved with people looking for tips, not for free anyway. Many a drunken fool confided in him, some telling him about secret treasures hidden to all but them, their bottle, and now the bartender. Some drank away murders, solemnly burying their emptiness with alcohol and women and rambling in slurred speeches about how nothing in the universe mattered but money. Still others couldn’t keep quiet about skeletons in their closet; Company secrets they were ashamed to be burdened with, or mobsters whose coffers they had just lightened. Bos-Bos stood idly by as those loose-lipped patrons learned their lesson the hard way; usually with a white hot pulse of lethal blaster fire.

“Wait.” The mechanized voice spoke, in english this time, just loud enough to be heard over the booming of the electronic music. Bos stopped and turned to see the man reach into his coat and pulled out a stack of blue and yellow plastic: Currency from a nearby system- and lots of it from what Bos could see. Even though the handful of money didn’t seem like much, the exchange rates in these parts for that particular denomination were astronomical. That handful could easily buy a ship or have a problem… Taken care of.

Bos walked back to the newcomer and leaned on the bar, facing away from him. “You got a name?” He asked.

“No.” Was the man’s response. Bos-Bos didn’t expect a straight answer, but he was too tired to play games this evening. The man continued in his computer-processed tone, “Where can I find Algo Nevazi?” Bos-Bos laid his agile paw on the currency and slipped it into his pocket. He nodded to a room in the back with blue drapes hiding it’s contents. Two beastly, slobbering aliens stood guard on either side of the door. The stranger tipped his hat and stood up, sifting his way through the crowd. Bos-Bos turned his attention to other patrons waving money in his face in exchange for tools of inebriation. Over the music his keen ears heard three blaster shots; the smell of blood and singed meat trailed to his nose.

The remnants of the afternoon rain drummed gently on the hood of Curtis’s Impala. It had been a typical summer thunderstorm in New Orleans, where the air had hung pregnant over the city with its particular cool fragrance until precisely three PM. Every afternoon, with a scheduled regularity that not even Mussolini could match, the sky itself seemed to open up as an ocean of cleansing rain poured down. The thunderstorm bathed the city and dispelled, if only for an hour, the oppressive June humidity. Tennessee Williams had called it a slice of eternity, but it made the shrapnel in Curtis’s hip- a nineteenth birthday present from the Japanese- ache. It hurt more than it used to. At 39 years of age, Curtis was getting a little old for the private detective game, but it was all he knew how to do and he wasn’t about to learn any new tricks. Curtis browsed the headlines of the States-Item sitting on the passenger side of the car’s bench seat- a monk in Indochina had lit himself on fire (which seemed a damn stupid thing to do), that fool Wallace had tried to stop some negroes from entering the University of Alabama, and there was a new Elizabeth Taylor picture out- Cleopatra. Wednesday, June 12, 1963.  
	The detective agency Curtis worked for had been hired by the FBI to keep tabs on suspected communist activity in New Orleans. Because of the city’s relative proximity to Cuba and strong financial ties to the Batista government, the Bureau was concerned about Pro-Castro agents operating in the area. Local private eyes had been hired, and any suspicious activity was to be reported to the field office on Poydras. For the past week or so, Curtis had been tailing a small, nervous man as he went to and fro around the city. This afternoon, Curtis waited for two hours during the rain outside a movie theatre on Prytania while his mark took in the afternoon matinee. 
He slid the Impala into gear as the wiry man with brown hair and nervous eyes hailed a cab and climbed into the back. Curtis had a fair idea where they were heading. This guy’s routine rarely changed. He’d leave his house off Magazine every morning, and take the bus downtown, where he had a day job at a coffee factory near the FBI field office. However, the man spent most of his time distributing pro-Castro flyers to disinterested pedestrians in front of the World Trade Mart on Camp. Curtis had watched as he got into shouting matches with passerby and shoved leaflets into the hands of women as they strolled by the river. He was a ridiculous character, but Curtis had to give the guy credit for being out there every day in the hot sun. After a day of passing out “literature”, he would take the bus home. Sometimes he went across the river to shoot with some friends, but mostly kept to himself. This guy was definitely a screwball and a hard-core commie. According to the file given to him by the FBI, this guy spoke Russian, had married a Russian even tried to live in the Soviet Union a few years back. For his part, Curtis didn’t think he was much of a danger to anyone but himself.
The cab pulled up to a run-down shotgun, and Curtis’s mark got out, picked up a long, thin package from the porch, looked around, and went inside. Curtis pulled up half a block away and parked. In four hours, the night shift would come on. Curtis cracked the window to let in the heavy early evening air. It had been a long day, and his seersucker suit was plastered to his body with sweat. The barrel of his .38 jammed into the soft flesh under his arm. Curtis had been a fullback at Warren Easton before he had been drafted into the Navy, big and powerful, still held the record for rushing yards in a season as far as he knew, but over the years the muscle had slowly turned to fat and arthritis settled in to his hips. Curtis took off his hat, wiped his brow, and opened the glove box. Inside was a bottle of K&amp;B brand whiskey and a glass. Curtis uncorked the bottle, poured himself a glass, and then another, and then a third, eventually losing count as he drained the bottle. He loosened his tie and settled into the warm liquor, letting the anesthetic flow into every corner of his body as his eyes became heavy.       
He was nineteen years old again. Smoke choked his eyes. His ears rang as the 5” guns fired again. Curtis’s muscles strained to lift another heavy shell into the gunhouse as the breech ejected the old casing. They had spotted the Jap destroyers an hour ago and had been firing ever since. Curtis was sure they had been hit, but not where or how bad. He just kept his head down and lifted shell after shell into the turret as the gun fired again and again and again. The last thing he remembered before it happened was Ensign Daugherty calling for a range adjustment. He never knew for sure what happened, although the Navy said a Nip torpedo had struck his ship, the USS Chevalier, in the bow, tearing off the forward third of the destroyer, along with sixty souls. When Curtis came to, he was covered in blood and had a searing, white-hot pain in his hip. The ship’s emergency lighting cast the compartment in a deep crimson. He could tell that the other five men in the gunhouse were dead.  He managed to pull himself out of the turret and collapsed onto the burning deck of the dying ship. Someone handed him a life preserver and Curtis slid into the Pacific as his ship capsized, spreading a burning oil slick over the sea like a funeral pyre. A corpsman pulled him into a life raft and injected him with morphine. Curtis felt himself drifting away again. The last thing he remembered was the rhythmic thump thump thump of the Jap destroyer’s guns.      
Curtis awoke to Luke tapping on the glass of the Impala. Luke was the night shift and would keep an eye on the commie’s house until the next morning. It wasn’t the first time that Luke had found him drunk. Curtis started the Impala and slowly pulled out into the street. By muscle memory, he found his way to his small apartment on Tchopitoulas, near the river. He had lived there since he had separated from his wife about five years ago. She had had enough of the liquor and irregular hours and had left with a schoolteacher to live in Fort Walton. Curtis walked up the stairs, unlocked the door, and put his revolver on the table. He opened the cylinder, looking glassy-eyed at the five dull brass .38 Special casings. He tapped the ejector, scooping out four. He closed his eyes and spun the cylinder shut, feeling the cold barrel on the stubble under his chin. He pulled the hammer back and the metallic click filled the apartment. A long moment passed, but Curtis knew he would never pull the trigger. He was too scared. He got undressed and fell asleep on the sofa listening to records.
He awoke the next morning and shaved. A cup of black coffee helped with the headache. He dressed, put on his gun, and went back out to his car. Fifteen minutes later he was back in front of the World Trade Mart watching this silly little man pass out his flyers. Curtis felt utter contempt for him now, standing out on the corner of the street bothering regular, hard-working Americans with his commie bullshit. According to his file, this guy was a loser, having held a series of odd jobs after busting out of the Marines. He had even tried to sell the know-how he picked up in the service to the Russians. Not even the Russians wanted him, sending him back to the U.S. after a year. This guy was a total failure, a joke. At yet here Curtis was, wasting his life watching some crackpot hand out a bunch of flyers. 
Curtis unsnapped the leather holster of his Smith &amp; Wesson revolver and reached for the door handle of the Impala. He was going to end this once and for all. He could see the little man about fifty yards away. Curtis would walk up to him, draw, and put two in his chest. Before getting out of the car, Curtis took his flask out of his coat pocket and helped himself to another shot. Then, he opened the door, stepped out, and began to make his way to the Trade Mart. Just then, an NOPD black and white pulled up to the stoplight at the corner of Camp and Common. Curtis froze in a moment of indecision. 
Curtis stood there for what seemed like an eternity until something grabbed his attention. He looked over at the corner where the nervous little man had been handing out his pro-Castro flyers. He had entered into a shouting match with a Cuban man who was now pushing him against a wall, yelling angrily. The wiry little man knocked the Cuban in the nose, sending him to the sidewalk. As the two men tousled on the ground, the two cops at the stoplight got out and broke up the fight, dragging the little man into the back of their squad car. As the officers drove off, the Cuban picked himself up and wiped the blood from his nose, walking towards the drugstore a few blocks up. Curtis turned slowly and walked back to his Impala, sinking into the driver’s seat. He would file his report for the FBI that afternoon. He was now convinced that this guy was a complete crackpot: Lee Harvey Oswald was a nobody, and his Castro flyers were a joke. Curtis started the Chevy and drove to the bar.

EDIT: Continued in comments

“The events in concern occurred on the 13th of September 1993. I had recently been transferred to the children’s ward of St. Isaac’s Hospital in Blackgate, because of my intention to specialise in paediatrics following my residency. Despite working with children, the children’s ward was by no extent of the imagination an easier place to work. Have no doubt that it was a place of stress and pain, for nothing tears the soul more than the screams of sick and dying men and women other than the shrill, piercing cries of tormented children. And despite not suffering from their ailments, tending to the ill has taken its toll on me.
Since the beginning of my residency I’ve been strung as taut as a bow, with little to no spare time or energy. However, it has only been since my transfer that the migraines began. I say migraines out of technicality. Yes, there are breaks, but if you ask me, it feels as if it has been a single perpetual migraine, from start to unforeseeable end. Even now the left side of my head is pounding, and vision in my right eye is becoming blurry, my eyelid twitching. But I digress...

On the morning of the 13th of September, I was completing my daily rounds when I found poor little Amanda Blakely face down on the floor next to her bed, lifeless. During the time since I moved to Blackgate I had become accustomed to death, but peaceful, still death. More often than not it was expected, and when it wasn’t there was a routine. But this... I was never prepared to see the corpse of a sickly young girl with leukaemia, face down on the floor, splatters of regurgitated blood on her sheets. I wasn’t prepared. I collapsed to my knees beside her and began to cry. Rivulets of silent tears trickled down my cheeks, and dripped off my chin and into my lap. I turned her over and saw her brilliant golden pendant gleaming magnificently against bleak blue-grey skin. The stark image struck me, implanting itself in my retinas and a wail escaped me, a bellowing howl of sorrow.

My lament drew the attention of the rest of the staff, even that of the head doctor: Dr. Arcurio Amos. Dr. Amos was what many described as a miracle worker. In his prime, prior to his promotion to head of the children’s ward, he had successfully completed almost every surgery he performed. He became the surgeon people asked for, and his skill soon propelled him to the position of head. At one point, it seemed his medical prowess transcended simply surgical contexts, and most any patient treated by him, no matter how violently they swayed on the brink of Limbo, was saved. Dr. Amos, however, fought his fame and chose to remain the most respected (and highly paid) man in Blackgate.
In recent times, Dr. Amos seemed to be losing more and more patients. Most people attributed it to his advancing age and predicted it wouldn’t be long before arthritis kicked in and his mind ceased to be what it once was. Dr. Amos was 58, but his face didn’t look a day over 40.  If one looked at his hands though, one could see the gnarls of old age beginning to form, but even those were looking better these days.
Dr. Amos suggested I take a break, an offer I gratefully accepted. I made my way to the break lounge, ordered a tea, and sat down in an effort to gather my thoughts. It was only 10am and I’d already broken down. It was going to be a long day. Suddenly, a crippling pain burst from the left side of my head. Had the migraine just now reared its head, or had it been there the whole time, I didn’t know. What I did know was that the aversion to light and sound that so often gripped sufferers of migraines had me in its grasp.

Every noise became too loud, too piercing. Every light became a blazing beacon of fluorescence, burning my eyes and searing my mind. Slowly, a high-pitched whine began to fill my ears, the source of which I could not quite pinpoint. I left my tea and fled the noise, leaving the lounge and turning into a storage closet on my left.
I was greeted by a dark, damp closet full of shelves stocked with bandages. The scorching light of the hospital was a mile away, and the whining in my head had disappeared. But those overwhelming senses were quickly replaced by another. A stench that reeked of something beyond the hospital, beyond anything I had smelled in my life, something beyond human existence. Never had such a malodour befouled my nostrils. Despite the almost definitely loathsome source of the putrid aroma, curiousity got the better of me. I turned on the (thankfully) dim light, and searched for the locus of putridity, and found it almost instantly. A viscous, membranous phlegmatic mass of ooze had engulfed the light bulb and clung to the ceiling above it. The yellowish mucus was the source of the stink, and the nearer I got to it, the more light headed I felt myself becoming. Every mouthful of the wretched odour I inhaled left me feeling emptier than the last and before long, I had lost consciousness.

I awoke sometime later not in the storage closet, but rather standing immediately outside the cadaver room. I entered, and was met by the most disturbing and gruesome thing I had ever encountered, whether in or out of the hospital.
On the table in the middle of the room lay a child’s corpse, arms and legs outstretched at odd angles. At the corners of the table candles had been lit, and emitted an unnatural blue-orange glow. The body was almost indistinguishable as once having lived. What had once been her face (for I could at least deduce the gender) was now beyond any identification. Long gashes lined her body and I fear I cannot describe the rest, for even now I grow nauseous discussing the topic. I averted my gaze to the floor, and saw upon it a small, gore-coated gleaming object. I picked it up and turned it over in my hand. It was Amanda’s necklace.
I ran from that wretched altar. Breathing heavily, desperately trying to fill my lungs I ran. Hot tears were streaming down my face yet again, my head and heart pounding. 

I returned to the hospital that night to investigate. My nights were mostly sleepless anyway. All doctors were given night access cards, but rarely used them unless absolutely required. The night staff were nowhere to be seen. I decided the best place to begin investigating would be the closet where I first encountered the sludge. I was far from the closet when I could detect that terrible stink, and the floor became slimy. The substance lined the floor, and trailed off into the darkness, an odd, perverted yellow brick road which wouldn’t lead me to the Wizard, but rather to something beyond my wildest dreams. My dreams aren’t pleasant.
I followed the trail of membranous phlegm until it stopped abruptly outside the office of head doctor Amos. Upon closer inspection I saw the trail didn’t end abruptly, but rather curved sharply into Amos’s office. As I reached for the door handle, I heard a voice... not Amos’s... not any person’s. The voice was raspy, as if the owner was breathing in to speak, and pronouncing sounds not with a tongue, but a throat. The moment I heard that hoarse, guttural abomination of speech a jolt of pain from my migraine caused me to recoil. Then I heard a second voice, the terrified voice of Dr. Arcurio Amos. I only caught snippets of the conversation, for it was difficult to understand the conversation.

“My d-dark shaman, I have made the s-sacrifice. Everything went smoothly. The fluid is in th-that jar.”
“Excellent, Arcurio, [Here I couldn’t understand] and now for your share..”
At that point an otherworldly roar erupted from Dr. Amos’s office, and a blindingly bright light shone from within. My mind felt like it was going to burst from within my skull. And as the overwhelming sound and light drove me into debilitating anguish, I let out an audible moan of pain.

“What was that?!” snapped the voice.
“I shall s-see, Master K’ogurur[?]”
I could hear Amos’s long strides coming towards the door. I could feel my heart attempting to leap out of my throat, to jettison itself to safety. I froze in horror as the door opened.
“YOU!” 
I was agape with fear. Amos looked younger. All traces of grey were gone from his hair, and his hands bore almost no evidence of the gnarls that once covered them. But that wasn’t the subject of my terror. No. Behind him stood... not stood.. hovered a mass of wings and teeth, the  mucus-like phlegm dripping from what I assume was its mouth. The moment I laid my eyes upon it, it turned to face me and I could not only smell the odour it was emitting, but feel it in my core. I could feel the scent of horror. The parts of the body I could see under the mass of leathery wings were covered in pulsating, pimple-like pustules.
The satanic seraph roared what I assume was a guttural order at Amos, and vanished in upon itself. The action it performed is impossible to describe...Not unlike imagining a man eating his own head.

Dr. Amos, now bright with youth, shot me a triumphant glare. With his ‘master’ gone he was his confident self again.
“Now, I suppose you’re expecting at least an explanation of the events preceding your death? I haven’t much time, so let’s make this quick. That was His Glory: K’ogugur, the Cosmic god of Death and Exploitation. I sacrifice younger patients to him so he may build his strength through the absorption of their ‘root fluids’, and in return he provides me with the leftovers of his Holy meal. And doesn’t it do wonders? They’ll heal almost anything, even time’s wounds... (chuckle) who knew the fountain of youth was the blood of the young?. Too bad they’ll never reach the modern medical world. Issues with ethics and contracts with Cosmic gods you see. Well, goodbye”

Send it to the next person. They would write another sentence or two, a paragraph if they like, then Send it to the next person on the list, then that person does the same thing. And the story would eventually be sent back to me once everyone on the list has written, the last person would write the end. I would try to get the story published somewhere with credit to every author. The way I would like this to work is I write my paragraph on a piece of paper, put it in an envelope with a list of the addresses of all of the people that are interested. After the first person gets it, they would write their paragraph, scratch their name off of the list and post here once they have sent the unfinished story, along with the address list to the next person so the story can be tracked and doesn't get lost in transit. I would like everyone that is involved to be as creative as possible and take the storyline anywhere they like. Is this an idea anyone would be interested in? Any ideas to make it better?

Edit:

This is now open for international writers also, provided you write in English.

There will be a minimum of two paragraphs and a maximum of two pages, that you can add to the story.

My goal for this is to be a continuous story, created by hundreds of people instead of a bunch of different stories.

Each writer should write their name on the side of the page beside the start of your section.

Everyone that is interested can send me their addresses on here with ""worldwide shared story"" at the top of your message or at jtwilson136@gmail.com with a subject of ""worldwide shared story"" and I will start making the list. Once I have enough people willing to get involved, with enough addresses I will notify everyone and send it to the first person.

Thoughts?,nanon0324,5,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/x5xnv/an_untitled_short_story_i_wrote_about_a_year_ago/,"The first thing that really registered for him was how incredibly soft the surface on which he lay was. Slowly, he grew aware of other factors around him, such as the earthy smell filling his senses – he inhaled it deeply; the springy, damp moss under his fingertips – he dug his fingers into it lightly; the sound of running water somewhere near him – he listened to it contentedly; and the light breeze playing across his naked body – he shivered from it delightedly. He became more and more aware of the uneven pattern of light penetrating his closed eyelids. He opened them.

Above him, sunlight was filtering in through the tops of the surrounding trees. He raised himself onto his elbows and looked around, bemused. He was lying in a small clearing, quite naked and quite alone, save the presence of a small stream beside him, but it ran on urgently, completely indifferent to his presence.

*Hmm*, he thought as he lay back down and placed his hands behind his head.

Strange as it was for him to be lying naked in the middle of a clearing with no recollection as to how he wound up there, it wasn't nearly as strange as the complete lack of curiosity he held for the situation. The oddness of it didn't even register with him. He was blissfully calm.

After what could have been hours or minutes, seconds or years, the figure of a woman sitting beside him became apparent to him.

She was sitting cross-legged a few feet from him, watching him curiously. A long, white dress made from a light, translucent material hung from her torso and gathered in bunches on the ground around her. Her hair was like light solidified – it moved fluidly and shimmered beautifully; he couldn't quite bear to look at it. Her skin was fair, but when the light brushed it, she seemed to give off a golden glow. Her eyes were green with flecks of gold in them one moment and a cool grey the next. The puzzled expression on her face made her all the more beautiful. Suddenly, the presence of this ethereal creature watching him quizzically made him very aware of the fact that he was naked. He wasn't surprised to find that he didn't care about that either.

""Hello,"" he began, and she sat up straighter with a start.

""Oh – hello!"" she replied, beaming, ""Sorry to stare, it's just…well, no one hardly notices I'm here until I address them.""

""Well, how do you decide when to address them?"" he inquired

""After I've decided whether or not they deserve an explanation."" she replied simply.

They lapsed into silence for quite some time –or possibly very little time, he couldn't really tell – but if she wasn't going to push the conversation, he was content to simply lie there. He closed his eyes again.

""So, who are you?"" she asked him suddenly.

His eyes sprang open. She was watching him again. This woman was starting to annoy him. He began to answer her question.

""My name is –,"" he paused.

*Weird*, he thought, *I can't remember.*

""I can't remember my name."" he finished simply and closed his eyes again.

""Really?"" she asked inquisitorially, ""Most people have at least a small memory of who they are.""

He opened his eyes, sat up, crossed his legs and faced her. She was beginning to interest him.

""Who are *you*?"" he asked her.

""Oh, we'll get to that later. You're different. I wish to speak with you a moment first. You're…intriguing.""

""Well, thank you?""

""I didn't mean it as a compliment, exactly."" she contested.

""Well, would you mind if I took it as one anyway?""

""I guess I can't really control what you think, feel, or do."" she replied, beaming again. ""You really are different. Tell me, where do you think you are?""

""Oh, I don't know. A forest somewhere, I'm assuming.""

""Ah. That is true,"" she said pleasantly, looking around them, ""but why?""

""Why…are you asking me?""

""Well, it's entirely up to you, isn't it?""

""…Not that I'm aware of, no."" he replied. He was beginning to feel curious about the whole thing. If he really thought about it, it was incredibly odd.

""Well, let's take a walk, shall we?"" and as she stood up, the dress fell around her in such a way that he found himself beginning to care that he was naked.

""Where will we go?"" he asked her, reluctant to leave the warmth and calm of the little sunlit clearing.

""Who knows?"" she replied, sincerely, and began walking away from him. Torn between his want to stay where he was and his desire to be in her presence, he hesitantly rose from his spot and caught up with her.

""So, are you going to tell me who you are?"" he asked her as he avoided the low lying vegetation on the path around him.

She was silent. She seemed thoughtful. She glanced at him, but did not even begin to answer his question. Suddenly a chill ran down his back that had nothing to do with the breeze caressing his limbs. They walked in unbroken silence for what seemed to be hours.

Eventually, they came to a lake at the forest's edge.

""I think…I'd like to get in."" he said.

In response, she smiled and sauntered to the water's edge. Sliding out of her dress, she laid it neatly upon the shore and slipped into the water, disappearing under the surface for a moment. By the time she reemerged, he had already followed suit and swam out to meet her. She smiled and dove down again, breaking the calm of the water's surface.

The water was warm, but refreshing. He enjoyed it immensely. Now that he began to think about it, he couldn't remember any time he'd ever felt this…okay.

They swam in silence for some time more and then just as suddenly as she'd gotten in the water, she got out. He watched her swim to the shore. He watched the water bead off of her body as she flipped her beautiful hair back and wrung it out. He watched her pass by her clothing. He watched her lay down on the shore. He watched her lay one arm over her eyes and one arm over her stomach.

And suddenly, he couldn't bear watching her anymore.

He swam back up to shore, slowly, deliberately.  He approached her and settled himself down beside her.

She looked over at him.

""Do you find me beautiful?"" she asked him softly.

He hadn't thought about it, but the second she asked the question, he realized he did. He told her so. She smiled and looked back up at the sky. They retreated into another stretch of pensive silence.

Suddenly, she rolled over and she kissed him.

He responded immediately, wrapping his arms around her and rolling her underneath him. She was kissing him fully, passionately. She was kissing down his neck and onto his chest. Her lips parted and her tongue darted out, exploring his skin, setting him on fire. A few moments ago, she was just a woman who happened to be in his company. Now, he wanted her so badly, it was driving him mad.

She pushed gently on his chest. He took the cue and rolled back over. She climbed on top of him and proceeded to kiss him roughly once more.

She was so warm. He was so overcome with desire for her.

That did it.

He pushed her back down and thrust himself into her.

Back and forth they went, fighting the other for control, graciously losing the battle. He'd never known anything like her. He could have taken her over and over again. She never tired.

Eventually, they lay exhausted, satisfied, contented. She moved over to lie on his chest.

""I'm almost sorry,"" she whispered sadly, ""that this can't last much longer.""

Maybe he was dreaming? That would explain a lot.

""What do you mean?"" he asked her softly.

""Well, you're possibly the best one I've ever met. Certainly you're the first one I've taken in…a very long time.""

""I…am still confused.""

""I don't understand why you did it…"" she continued.

Her expression was unreadable.

""Did what? Can you please start making some semblance of sense?""

""Killed yourself – I don't understand why you did it.""

He stopped for a moment before he answered. ""Ah,"" he started, ""I'm dead. That…fits. I don't remember who I was, though.""

""That's what I hate. They usually do."" She sighed.

""My point is, I can't explain why I – killed myself, you say?""

""Yes."" She pushed herself up to look him in the eyes.

""Well, I'm sorry I can't answer that for you. So, is this heaven?""

She laughed delightedly, a bubbly, cheerful laugh that was almost infectious. He felt warm hearing it.

""Why do they always ask if this is heaven? No. This isn't heaven. There is no heaven. This is just…well, I can't explain it, and it wouldn't matter if I could. You don't care either way to know what this is.""

He nodded. She was right.

""So, how long ago did I end my life?"" he asked her – it was the only thing he was truly curious about.

""Oh, dear, time doesn't exist anymore for you. Not here. Not ever again.""

""But, if you had to give me a time…?""

""If I had to?"" she asked, looking him dead in the eye.

""Yes. Please?""

""The gun is still warm. If we were to base it off your perception of time, the suicide happened just moments ago.""

""Even though I feel as if I've been here for an eternity?""

""Exactly,"" she smiled, ""You certainly are one of the lucky ones. No one is quick to accept this as plainly as you do – nor do they truly understand it.""

""Well, if I were in need of console, I suppose that would be a comforting bit of news."" He returned her smile and leaned over to kiss her shoulder.

""Like I said, I'm almost sorry this can't last much longer."" she repeated sadly.

""Oh, yeah, what was that about?""

""Well, in a moment, you have to go on.""

""Wait – this isn't already 'on'?""

""I'm afraid not."" She smiled sadly.

""Damn,"" he said plainly.

Around him, the forest was fading. The sunlight was fading. The water was fading. Even she, and all her ethereal golden beauty, was fading.

Then suddenly, everything was gone.

There was nothing.

He was no more.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1343357742.0,,,True,t3_x5xnv,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/x5xnv/an_untitled_short_story_i_wrote_about_a_year_ago/,

The man sat quietly in the vehicle with music playing from it. He gently tapped his fingers on his legs as he listened. Emilia suddenly felt the air grow cold; she didn't want him to see her. Carefully Emilia hid behind an old food seller’s stall. There was still food rotting in their containers, the smell made her want to gag almost as much as the stench from the streets. She wasn't concerned with what Mr. Hawkes thought of her hiding. He had actually turned around and was heading back for the door. This was probably a wise decision. 

By now Emilia was almost feeling light headed.  A loud creak interrupted the silence of the bare streets and she turned to see Mr. Hawkes closing the door to the district. It was now that Emilia saw the piercings in the metal door. It looked like a mob of tiny hornets had tried to sting through the door. She recognized now that the street was soaked in old blood, that everyone here had been killed. They didn't even bother to scrub the streets here. Mr. Hawkes did not acknowledge her presence as he walked past where she was hiding. The little man in the vehicle saw Mr. Hawkes approaching and met him with a respectful bow. With this notion, either Mr. Hawkes was far higher in the aristocracy than Emilia thought or the man was far below Mr. Hawkes. 

""I want to see Chelsea Zebra."" Mr. Hawkes said clearly, possibly loud enough so Emilia could hear him. She wanted to hate him if he had something to do with this and there is no way she could leave without finding out. If anything, she was trapped here with them now. 

As the small man lead Mr. Hawkes into a white washed building, Emilia slowly followed them, making sure to keep close to places in which she could hide. The white washed building appeared to have had its windows blown out, and the inside was really nothing but rubble. The entire ceiling had collapsed. A woman sat a good ways inside, wearing a uniform that Emilia did not recognize. Mr. Hawkes greeted her and the woman kissed him on both cheeks. Her smile was genuine but her eyes reflected something that the girl could not describe. The two of them sat down on some make shift chairs made out of rubble, the woman making sure to sit very close to Mr. Hawkes.

""Like my latest achievement, Hawkes?"" The woman asked smugly as she raised her arms and stared up at the open ceiling. 
""It was unnecessary to do any of this, Chelsea,"" Mr. Hawkes answered quietly; even the ground in the building was covered in old blood,"" How many did you kill?""

""It doesn't matter, it’s for the greater good, this area will be a new district for us."" the woman named Chelsea started, ""I can see it now, a wonderful park over there by the entrance with towering trees, and I already figured that this building would be rebuilt to be our house.""
Mr. Hawkes slowly shook his head.

""I made this place for you, Hawkes!"" Chelsea growled. She seemed the sort of person that was quick to anger, ""This place, so that you can be close to the filth that you love so much.""

The small man that had accompanied Mr. Hawkes into the building shied away from Chelsea a bit. He seemed to be used to her angry fits. 

""I am not in line to be married right now, and you were not one of my first choices."" Mr. Hawkes said bitterly.

He stood up from the rubble and began to walk away.

""Our families are meant to be united; do you know what will happen to us if I cannot be married up?"" Chelsea screamed after him, ""I'll be doomed down here, Hawkes!"" 

Mr. Hawkes quickly wandered for the exit of the building. As if knowing that Emilia would be there, watching, he grabbed her by the arm and dragged her towards the entrance to the district. It was the opposite direction of the tram station but Emilia knew better than to struggle with the grip of a man. Many times she had seen men from the Order Committee break the bones of people that tried to resist. With her unhealthy conditions Mr. Hawkes could probably break her arm with a flick of the wrist. As they approached the door, Mr. Hawkes shoved her through the exit and followed. For one split second his face relaxed when he looked at her, he smiled his usual confident smile. 

""I can't have you staying down here with people like her, I want and need you to be safe,"" He said quickly, ""And at eighteen you can decide for yourself what you want, I won't influence your choices what so ever.""

Mr. Hawkes turned to the old vendor by the door and purchased a small carton of artificial milk. His hand was trembling slightly but to Emilia, it was clear he was terrified. He slowly sipped his milk as he returned to the open metal door to close it. Several large bangs erupted and within a blink he had collapsed at Emilia's feet. Mr. Hawkes body had fallen into the threshold of the bloody district. His carton of milk had spilled and coated the brown street; a new shade of red was now mixing into it. Emilia peered around the corner of the metal door and saw the small man peering at what he had just done; a smoking weapon was in his hand. His face was in shock at what he had done. Behind him stood Chelsea, scowling at Mr. Hawkes dead body, a look of pure disdain.

Emilia wondered if all was lost for her now. Her mind was filled with an intolerable fear that she could not understand. She fell to her knees at Mr. Hawkes side and she struggled to drag him out of the bloody district. Emilia's frail arms tense and her muscles worked but the weight of this man was immovable for a malnourished girl. She screamed as another explosion erupted, a shell-less something whizzing past her right ear. Were they going to kill her now? Fear, fear was all Emilia knew right now but her mind still raced, wondering on how to get him out of her. It didn't matter if he was dead or alive; she couldn't leave him in that place. 

The head was dissipating from Mr. Hawkes body. Emilia knew what this meant. She had held a stray animal once that had been starving. It died in her arms and the feeling of life draining from its body was something she would never forget. Emilia screamed again, tugging on his torso, she managed to roll him over but his face was covered in muddy old blood and his own. The goblin man appeared and dragged Mr. Hawkes back into the market place. He was strong, regardless of how he looked. He managed to close district door with one swift movement. Emilia realized that she was still screaming, her face was hot and she could still hear the explosions on the other side of the door. The sound was haunting her, why would they keep shooting? 

The goblin man rested his head on Mr. Hawkes chest, listening for a heartbeat. He gave no look of relief for Emilia. It was true, Mr. Hawkes chest was not rising and falling as it should have been. His heat was gone and Emilia felt all of her losses at once. She felt the loss of her father, the disappearance of her mother, even the loss of the stray animal. This was far too much. Emilia rested her head on his chest and closed her eyes, struggling to hear something, anything. She heard sirens; the Order Committee's medical team arrived.

I’m not talking about the moment when it actually ends.  Not the moment when you hear the words.  I’m talking about when you can just tell.  When you can feel the water start dripping through the dam and there’s nothing you can do to stop the impending flood.  For a while you try to convince yourself that you’re happy with what’s about to occur.  You try to convince yourself that you don’t care if the dam gives way.  Yet before you can even realize it, you’ve thrust your finger into the dam.  Without even realizing it you’ve gone from total indifference to willing to risk life and limb to stop the leak.  Willing to stand there for as long as it takes for the water to recede.  It had to become real first, maybe, before you truly realized you didn’t want it to end.  And this ‘finger in the dam’ plan seems to work at first.  You can tell some water is still getting through but you don’t care because it’s working.  So what if you have to stand here for eternity plugging the hole...at least the dam hasn’t given way.  You can do this.  You can stop the flood.  At least the dam hasn’t given way.  But eventually there comes a time when you’re standing in front of the dam and you realize there’s nothing you can do to stop the tide.  And you think back to when you first felt those drops of water on the dry side of the dam.  Saw those first signs that the dam wasn’t structurally sound.  And you realize something about the whole experience.  You realize the worst part about all of this won’t be when the dam gives way.  Not when the waters rise and wipe out roads.  Not when people flee their hopes with photo albums held tightly.  The worst part was when you first noticed those small, significant drops on your side of the dam.  When you knew the flood was coming no matter what you did.   That feeling is partially freeing.  Knowing now with the dam breaking apart all around you that you’ve passed the hardest part.  You’re sure you’ve passed the hardest part.

You think that up until the very moment the dam bursts and icy water hits you like a freight train.  And in that moment you realize you were wrong.  You yearn for the leaky helpless feeling because it meant you weren’t drowning.  At least the dam was intact then.  You long for those times you lied to yourself about not seeing the initial drops. When you lied to yourself saying you were convinced you could stop Mother Nature herself with one of your fingers.  You long for that as the water swallows you up.  This is the worst part.  Drowning.

I was in Paris not terribly long ago and had occasion to visit the Centre Pompidou. The modern art housed there was fantastic, but there was one exhibit there that stayed with me – I don’t remember what it was called.  You walked into a room.  An empty room save for a piano and a thermometer.  An empty room save for a piano and a thermometer and thick sheets of felt lining the walls.  I knew the purpose of that thermometer.  It was blistering hot in that room.  The felt trapped every ounce of heat that came in.  The felt also did something else.  Something that is not entirely easy to explain.  The felt soaked up every single bit of sound inside of that room and I could hear absolutely nothing.  I was standing in the middle of that room and I could not hear a thing. Not the sound of my lungs inflating, deflating.  Not the sound of my tongue as I moved it nervously through my mouth.  Nothing. I assume this was the purpose of the room - to suck up all the sound.  I then started to hear a very faint high-pitched hum.  My brain could not handle the complete absence of sound so it had to manufacture this now growing hum so I could have something to hear.  That’s what the car ride was like.  She picked me up from class with plans to drive me to my car across campus.  To drive me to my car across campus so we could have a chance to talk.  For the first three minutes of that four and a half minute car ride there was nothing.  No sound at all.  I was sitting in the passenger seat being driven to the slaughter and I could see that piano and that thermometer and all that felt all around me.  And I couldn’t hear anything.  Not the hum of the engine, not the sound of passing cars.  I was in that hot, felt room and I began to sweat and my brain kicked in with a substitute sound for that God-forsaken felt silence.  That familiar high-pitched frequency was back.  It consumed me.  I couldn’t breath.  I was in a vacuum with a piano and no oxygen.  I reached my right hand to the window switch and once the vacuum seal was broken on the felt car and the window lowered all my senses immediately returned.  I was shocked back into existence and the high-pitched frequency was now gone; replaced by passing cars, the hum of the engine.  I stuck my head out the window like a medium-to-small-sized dog and for a moment I forgot that this car ended at the glue factory and I was Boxer.  I tried to spend the remaining 90 seconds not thinking about my impending fate, but that was, of course, impossible.  We pulled into the parking lot near my car and God they should build a monument there for me.  She talked.  I nodded.  I asked why.  She answered.  I leaned my neck forward so the axe could make a clean strike.  God they should build a monument there for me.  I didn’t try to fight. I knew what was happening.  After she swung the blade, I left and didn’t turn back.  I was like Cicero.  Dying with whatever dignity one can be executed with.  I walked away towards my car convincing myself not to look back.

It was true, Reaper was no longer a man of the living, but from his last act of life came the second chance of retribution; that's what happens when a human gives their own life for the protection of an Innocent. Now where was I? Oh yes, the vampires.”

Well Reaper, this great giant of a machine, never so much as flinched when one of the demons would so much as rake his clothing. His great shoulder-pads, with spikes, I might add, absorbed even the strongest of blows from these creatures. Not that many got close enough to touch him, that is!”

At this, the bartender laughed, a hardy guffaw, that rang through The Lantern. Alice simply looked at him, jaw-dropped in honor and a little horror. Could such a being really exist?

“Well of course he exits, little Alice,” said the barkeep, reading the child's face and thoughts. “He's just as real as you or I as we sit here now.” Alice couldn't believe this. Her smile turned wider—such an image! A great beast, with glowing eyes behind its mask, crushing cars beneath its tremendous boots, simply thrashing its way through the evil of the city, not taking a scratch! Truly, this was the stuff of legends.

“But, even as the last vampire was slain, something was changing in our very city's soul. For on that day, as people say, when the streets were flooded from the blood of Hell, Reaper removed his mask.” Alice's face fell—something was wrong? What could be wrong with...with death?

“No one knows, little one.” Answering without listening, the keeper continued. “No one to this day knows why he did what he did, or even what he looks like. There is one more story that floats through this town about that...man. If even a single glimpse of that monster's true face were to be seen...poof!” His hands shot out an inch, but caught the girl off guard.

At this, Alice squeaked and nearly toppled off her chair from the start, but stopped herself right before the floor. Reaching over quickly, a strong, mighty hand lifted her gracefully up onto the counter, placing her daintily down. “Woah there, little one! Best not to be falling to the floor! Haven't cleaned it in a week. Now...about that legend....” Alice imitated the bartenders gesture and mouthed his last word, “poof,” to him. “Ah yes, thank you. Well, let me just conclude by saying that no living soul has seen this beast without his mask. No one alive anyway. Save for one man.”

Right as the secret was to be revealed, the door to The Lantern banged open, and a loud “Alice!” rung out.

“She's here, Kyle. Down here. Don't you worry, I've been taking good care of her,” the keeper replied.

“Oh thank Maria. Alice! What have I told you about running off? And without your shoes again?” Kyle strode down the staircase into the bar, his trench-coat floating behind him. Alice leaped off the counter and into her uncle's arms. “What am I going to do with you?” Alice just hugged him tight.

“You've got yourself a sweet girl, sir. And don't worry, she's always safe with me.”

“I know that, Joseph, I know. It's just...I worry about her. Ever since her parents....” Kyle trailed off, the pinch from Alice's little hands tightened ten-fold at this phrase, and a tear slipped down his coat. “Oh, Alice,” Kyle whispered. “I'm sorry.”

Alice sobbed into her uncle's chest, gently shaking. Behind his sunglasses, Kyle shed a tear of his own. “I'm so sorry.” Kissing her head, Kyle held her tightly.

“Looks like we best be going; thanks for watching her for me, Joseph.”

“Forever and always, sir. That's what I'm here for. Oh, and I hope you don't mind, but I mentioned your...friend to the girl while you were away. Nothing too much, but I felt like you should know.”

Kyle's heart dropped a little at this. “Maybe next time,” he said colder than he meant, “you should try a different story.”

“Right, sir. Very sorry, sir.”

“Good day, Joseph.”

“Good day, sir. Good day, Alice.” At this, Alice lifted her head only a fraction of the way, but managed a smile which warmed the room.

As the door atop the steps closed, Joseph began to close down. He swept the counter and stools, checked on the register, and made his way out. But at the top of the stairs, looking back, he could have sworn his life he saw something he shouldn't have seen—two little spheres in the darkness, each a dull yellow.

Rooted to the spot, Joseph didn't dare move. But a second later, they were gone. Quickly locking the door behind him, he nearly ran home, hoping to put this event far, far behind him.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_vlx89,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/vlx89/the_lantern_reapers_return_part_1_looking_for/,

Enjoy....)

The sinister minds that surround me are cackling now, menacing each other with insults. Restless, they are swirling and swarming, snapping at each other, laughing. They are shouting and screaming, boasting about their misdeeds.

I'd do it again if I had the chance, one says.

Yeah, well, let’s see you get out of here first, another retorts. Then I’ll be impressed.

Sometimes these minds swap stories about the men who locked us in here. The ones who vacuumed us away, and imprisoned us in this scientific hell. Those prison guards in tan jumpsuits. The ones whose nametags read STANTZ, and VENKMAN. SPENGLER, and ZEDDEMORE.

I remember my life. I remember the meals my parents made me eat. How big they were. On an average night, we could each go through a whole steak, followed by two chicken wings and a lobster, then eat two slices of cheesecake and a piece of pie before it was time for bed. And of course, if I didn’t finish it all, My Mother, The Tyrant, would beat me and make me stand in the corner. This was every night until I moved out at 19--and at 350 pounds.

Twenty-five years later, as I climbed the stairs to my hotel room on the twelfth floor, my arm went numb and I crashed to the ground.

After that I was sent back, and it quickly became obvious that I had been sent back to suffer. My body had been transformed into a grotesque mass of ectoplasm. I’d been fairly handsome in life, despite my weight, but now I was a greasy, legless, bloated monster. I had chins and folds all over my body, and I sweated a viscous, green substance that dripped off me like slime. I smelled atrocious, and when I looked down at myself I could practically see the stench boiling off of me, rising like heat from desert sands. My teeth were huge and yellow, and I couldn’t speak--not that I had anything to say, or anyone to say it to.

What’s worse, I was almost completely intangible. I could move some things if I concentrated, but food passed right through me like I wasn’t there. If I tried eating an apple, it would fall through my mouth and onto the floor. If I drank a bottle of wine, it would pour onto the carpet as if nothing were in its way. And of course, despite feeling more desperate to eat than I ever felt in life, I couldn’t taste a single thing.

I had to eat, but I couldn’t. It made perfect sense, I suppose. Being shackled again to this human realm, twisted to resemble my sins, and forced to live out the actions that led to my death, all the while receiving no pleasure from it. In a way it was poetic. And anyway, it’s not like I didn’t know why I was there.

The first attempt by the men to contain me had been startling. It was while I was at a food cart that had been abandoned by room service when they saw me coming. I was grabbing and pawing at the food, attempting to taste something, throwing aside plates, desperately trying to satisfy a need that couldn’t be satisfied. Then the one whose nametag read STANTZ crept up beside me. I was too focused on the food to acknowledge him, but I never suspected that he could hurt me, now that I was almost as unsubstantial as air. Then I heard a snap, followed by a slow, building whine, and a terrible burst of light lashed out at me. Terrified, I turned tail and fled.

It was the first pain I felt since the one in my chest, those years before.

But the actual capture was even worse.

I might understand why they did it, though. I had assaulted one of them. After the one named STANTZ attacked me, I escaped through a wall and wound up looking at another man in the same clothes, carrying the same equipment. I froze. As I watched, he raised a walkie-talkie to his lips, and began to speak. That was when I knew for sure that they were actively seeking me out. I was never a violent person, but now I knew that these men, with their guns that fired burning orange light, had the power to hurt me. So I defended myself. I roared and flew at VENKMAN, and left him incapacitated, covered in slime.

I knew it wouldn’t kill him, but maybe it would scare them away, make them give up.

But less than an hour later, I was lashed across the back by electric whips, and a metal solitary confinement cell opened beneath me. I was stretched, morphed, and shrunk as I was dragged down, into blackness.

And now here I am, sharing that blackness with these criminals and monsters.

They arrive angry, but I only remember being sad.

In here, in the unit, there is nothing to see. Only blackness. The only sensory input is the thoughts of the other prisoners. They are the rapists, murderers, they are thieves and arsonists and felons, gunned down by police to wind up in prison--again. Mostly I keep quiet and avoid their attention. Let them bicker and shout at each other, not at me. It’s just better that way.

Ghosts do exist. And yes, they are frightening. Even to each other.

Lately there have been whispers of a soul that is stronger than all of us. And among these minds, there have been whispers of a plan. My cellmates are suggesting that this soul may be powerful enough to defeat even our captors, and that once the human world is overthrown, beings like us will rule, and bring about a new age in the history of the earth. This has put difficult questions in my head.

If our evil captors are defeated by a soul more powerful than my cellmates, is that a good thing?

If our evil captors put us in here, are they actually evil?

The thought panics me, because I may already know the answer.

Because heart disease is hereditary.

It was after college graduation that I found her on the floor. My Mother, The Tyrant. 500 pounds if she was an ounce. As I walked in, she looked up at me, eyes full of pain, and said, help me, Morris. You have to call an ambulance. I'm having a heart attack!

I did call an ambulance, in the end. But first I pulled up a chair, cracked open a soda, watched until she stopped breathing. The pain in her eyes turned to confusion, then to panic, then to anger, and then she died, cursing me, denouncing me as a mistake. I can’t really argue with her there.

It’s not like she didn’t deserve it, though. And I don’t consider myself a bad person. But I guess whatever powers that be thought differently.

So as I’m stuck here, in this metal prison, with all of these monsters, horrible spirits birthed from the husks of horrible men, I can’t help but wonder, out of school, work, family, my entire life, did I fit in anywhere else as well as I do here?

And why is everything vibrating?

Now our confines have begun to shake. There is a terrible noise--a long, explosive shriek. Among us, there is confusion, swearing, and panic, but then, we feel ourselves lifted up, light entering above us, and we are blasted out of the machine, into the sky. There is elation, and a last-second consensus: The stronger one is coming.

And all I want is to go back inside.

",brannigansmaw,5,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/v9t6k/wrote_this_on_an_hour_long_train_journey_if_you/,"I wrote the following on a train journey. Took me about an hour start to finish and it's not been edited. 

The prompt was:

'A friend rings your doorbell way too early in the morning to be ringing doorbells. You answer the door in your PJs, and the friend says, “Pack a bag quickly. I have to get out of here now and need you to come with me.”'

  Pete was silent as he drove. This wasn’t unusual. Being mute, Pete was silent pretty much all the time. What was unusual was being woken up at two in the morning by Pete banging on my door. Stranger still was being handed a note—I was still getting to grips with sign and so if something need to be said quickly a note was usually the most efficient. I have to leave town tonight. Please come, I need help. That was all it said. I asked what this was all about but he just signed please. I could tell from the look in his eyes that it was serious. It was a look of childlike pleading. I nodded and went back inside to grab some clothes. It was mid-August and the nights were still mild, but not mild enough for boxers and a vest.

  That was almost an hour ago. Since then we had been on the road. Pete nervously checked his rear-view mirror every twenty seconds or so.

  ‘Pete. There’s no one behind us. We’re the only car on the road.’

  Pete looked at me briefly and seemed to relax a little.

  ‘Come on pull over. Tell me what’s going on. You’re not kidnapping me are you?’

  Pete smiled slightly and shook his head.

  ‘Good ‘cos I’m telling you no one is going to pay much for me. Come on man, pull up here.’

  Pete glanced in the mirror one more time then pulled over. He switched the engine off and sighed.

  ‘So?’ I said. ‘Mind telling me what the hell is up?’

  He opened his door and got out, then gestured for me to follow him to the back of the car. I did.

  We stood in front of the trunk and Pete gave me the ‘Ok?’ sign.

  ‘I don’t know. To be honest I’m a little nervous now. What’s in there?’ I pointed at the trunk.

  Pete sighed again and flipped the handle. The trunk swung open and what I saw left me stunned. Pete turned away and put his hands to his head in silent anguish.

  ‘Is that?’ I turned to him. ‘Pete. You didn’t. Tell me you didn’t.’            

  But Pete just looked at me with guilty eyes. He did. I turned back to the trunk and stared. Looking back at me, through dark eyes was the sight that had stunned me so. The thing that now made me wish I had never come along.  A pretty happy looking poodle.

  ‘You’re a fucking idiot, Pete.’

  Pete nodded.

  The poodle belonged, unmistakably, to Roger Oats. Rog for short. Rog was a big name in town; he owned a lot of the housing, along with a couple of convenience stores and a garage. Rarely a day went past that he didn’t appear in the town newspaper giving a donation or receiving a medal or some thing. He also happened to be a bona fide psychopath; rumour has it he once caught a kid throwing eggs at his car on Halloween and had two of his ‘staff’ smash the poor kid’s knees to bits. The kid said he’d been in a hit and run, of course. Rog also regular professed that he loved only one thing in this world, his pet poodle, Pecan.

  ‘Why is Pecan in the trunk of your car, Pete? Please tell me you got a job as a dog-sitter.’

  Pete explained that two nights earlier he had been in the convenience store downtown when Rog had walked in with his usual entourage. Rog had never liked Pete, he resented him for being content in spite of his disability. Contentedness came from money and power in Rog’s world. There was that, and also probably the fact that Pete nailed Rog’s wife before she was Mrs Oats. That too. Rog had started the usual insults but Pete had heard it all before and this seemed to anger Rog even more. It’s a fine hot day, don’t you think? You look like you need to cool off. He had said to Pete. He then gave the order to his cronies to put Pete in the large ice cream freezer at the back of the store. Apparently they kept him in there for twenty minutes before leaving. Humiliated, and pretty cold, Pete had taken to getting mortally drunk. On his way home from the bar he had detoured past Rog’s huge home with the intent of pissing on his car door handles but when he saw Pecan sitting all alone just on the other side of a small garden fence, his plan changed.

  ‘You ran home through main street carrying a Poodle. No one saw that? No one thought that was odd? Where do we live, man?’

  Pete shrugged then continued his story.

  The next morning he had awoken with a crippling hangover. When he remembered what he had done, he spent the day panicking, before deciding the pest policy was to flee.

  I shook my head. And what now? Were you planning on letting it go? Killing it?

  Pete glanced up.

  ‘Fuck off, I was kidding. I’m not killing a poodle at the side of the road you maniac. Look. The only thing we can do is go back there and return it. Maybe if you apologise.’

  Pete shook is head violently then made the sign for stupid.

  ‘Yeah, fair enough. Well why don’t we return it and say we found it? Make it like the thing escaped and you are bringing it back. That could work.’

  Pete thought for a minute then ruffled his hair.

  ‘Pete, it’s our only option. Come on, get back in the car.’

  Pete looked skyward then marched back to the driver’s side. The sky began to brighten as we drove back into town.

  ‘We’re going to need to be quick, sun’s coming up. We don’t want people seeing you take the dog out of the trunk.

  We pulled in down the street from Rog’s house. Pete took Pecan out of the trunk and we walked down the street and up the drive to the front door. Pete rang the bell and looked at me.

  ‘Here we go.’

  A short, fat, thick looking man opened the door. He had a face that looked like it had been kept in a vice throughout his childhood, and beady far-apart eyes. He took one look at Pecan and ran back into the hallway yelling. After a few seconds Rog appeared at the door.

  ‘Pecan!’ he cried and grabbed the confused looking dog from, nuzzling it, kissing it’s face and tickling it’s chin—or whatever the canine equivalent is. It was all a bit weird. When he was done reacquainting himself with Pecan he turn back to Pete and I. ‘Explain yourselves. Well, not you Peter, we’d be here all fucking night. You. What’s the story?’

  ‘We found it. Near my place. Was just wandering around and Pete recognised it. Said it was yours so we brought it down.’

  Rog eyed Pete suspiciously.

  ‘And where is your place?’ He said, sneering.

  ‘Up the hill.’ I pointed back. Pete nodded. ‘It’s a real nice poodle, Rog. Very pretty.

  ‘It’s not a fucking poodle you idiot. It’s a cross between a schnauzer and a poodle.’

  I didn’t know what to say. ‘Right. Well.’ That would have to do.

  ‘Schnoodle.’

  ‘Sorry?’ I said.

  ‘That’s what it’s called. It’s a schnoodle.’

  ‘Oh, right! Yeah of course. It’s a Schnoodle, Pete.’ This had all gotten a bit strange and I was desperately seeking a way out of the poodle schnoodle conversation thread. ‘Yeah well like I say Rog. We found it, we brought it back. Safe and well.’

  ‘And you two were out and about at five in the morning? Bit odd, no?’

  Shit. I thought. Should probably have planned for this.

  ‘Well we…we were actually looking for my dog. Funny that.’

  He stared at me and Pete. Pete was not helping our cause by refusing to make eye contact with Rog.

  ‘Your dog? What kind of dog is it? Maybe one of my guys has seen it.’

  ‘Oh, it’s a cross between a dachshund and a Labrador.’

  ‘Dabrador huh?’

  ‘Yeah sure.’ Why not, I thought.

  Rog didn’t say anything for a while.

  ‘I don’t know what you two are playing at, and I don’t want to know. Not yet anyway. But if I find out you had something to do with my poor Pecan disappearing, I’ll fucking break your legs. Comprende?’

  Comprende? Jesus what an ass hole.

  ‘Yeah. Umm. Comprende Rog. Come on Pete.’

  We walked down to the bottom of his drive and out into the street.

  ‘Next time Pete. Just piss on his car door handles, ok?’

  He smiled.

The day began like any other, I awoke from my slumber rested with a full bladder and leapt out of bed with an enthusiasm unknown to my body since boyhood, performed the morning rituals, then dressed for the festival. Yes, it was the festival of Mars, the crimson globe would be close enough to touch for a period of three hours and in celebration all day there would be dancing, feasting, and singing. There would be enough wholesome debauchery for all, so the party continued.

Finally the time came when the sun was high in the sky, musicians were gathered to play while choirs sang and heralds spoke. As Mars rose over the horizon the air was electrified with cheering and jubilation on every corner, where neighbors rejoiced together. The world was alive in show as acrobats, fire eaters, and sword dancers performed so the party continued.

An hour passed while the ancient celestial behemoth rose silently, partially shading us from the sun's glow. Our guest of honor was passing its climax when a crazed citizen had the impossible notion that it was still growing, nobody listened. Picnickers sat on the red grass covered hills and lovers clung to each other their passion waxing with the sanguine world, so the party continued.

At the third hour when the red planet should have been nearly set it grew ever more. The terrified man from earlier was running around emphatically repeating ""I told you so, you didnt listen, but i told you so, now what will you do?"" not a single head turned, there was still food, drink and song, so the party continued.

When the immense being filled the heavens and turned the sky to blood we took little notice. There were no stars only the great eerie orb could be seen in every direction and the man who dreaded its coming fell to his knees and begged the planet “turn back, stop please I'll do anything”. Darkness flooded the world however our lanterns provided enough light for the festivities to go on, so the party continued.

We were awestruck by the breathtaking canals painted with life's essence upon the face of Mars and the man sat there with us blankly staring into the sky. The cities that could now be seen were stunning works of art and gravity was bringing that overwhelming beauty closer and closer to us, so the party continued.

And when Mars rained its judgement on our peaceful little village not a soul flinched. The God like object crushed our planet without so much as a ""pardon me"". There was nothing left of the world we had inhabited, but none of that mattered to us, because the party continued.

The basic premise is: 


*Miguel Brown, a self-centered aspiring screenwriter, is invited to a reunion at Stonefalls City College after living several years in Los Angeles with no contact from any of his old college friends. Upon reuniting with them, he recounts his college days and begins to remember what he used to be like. This motivates him to move back to the town of Stonefalls, where he reflects on his memories in order to overcome the struggles he faces in the present time.*


Some notes I have received so far:

* ""Your characters suck. I don't feel any emotional response to any of them.""

* ""I would limit the amount of characters you intend to focus on (it's at about 12 people right now, I think).""

* ""This is tries too hard to be Community. Make it a high school show!""

* ""Wow, that Miguel guy is depressing as fuck. I thought this was a comedy.""

* ""Who is this? And why are you calling so late?""

* ""For the last time, stop asking me if I think it's good. Because it's not. Okay, I was kidding, now put down the knife and let her go.""

* ""Excellent! More paper means more fire. More fire means more houses burn! YOU CAN GO TO HELL, JAMIE! BURN IN HELL!""

* ""I'm not gonna read it if I'm only the eighth person you've asked.""

I tried damnedest to ignore them because they didn't make a lick of sense. But I finally sat down and wrote them out and was very surprised by what came out. So here it is:

***

  I’d love to say that I can’t remember that day anymore. But that would be a lie. 
I can remember every smell from that night. The smell from the oil cooking on the 
radiator was set deep in my skin for months. It didn’t matter how many times I showered
and scrubbed my skin raw, I could still smell it. The blue, green, black nasty color from
the steering wheel is no longer there, but the ring is firmly implanted in my skin. Why did you
have to grab the wheel? I had everything under control, even though you’ll never admit it. 

 Are you ever going to quit staring at me? Maybe you should haunt someone else. 
You know, someone who cares that you're gone. Or at least someone who thinks 
you are gone.  I can’t help but laugh as I see your head smashed in on the side. 
Your perfect face destroyed.

 I thought the afterlife would be more interesting. Guess not if you’re here haunting me. 

 I still drive past your house twice a week. I used to give it the bird. Did you think that
I would ever forgive you for what you did? You tried to kill me and I there isn’t much I
can do to get back at you. Once, I egged your truck. The mess sat there for a month. I
guess your parents couldn’t find time to clean it off. Like they couldn’t find time to take 
you to get help. Now there are small white patches covering your beloved machine. 
I wonder if it even runs anymore?

 You know how much I hate the dark? I hate it even more now because of you. I have to
keep a light on as I step into a new room. I shut my eyes as I walk in the dark. I am so 
scared of what I might see. Whoever your new friends are aren’t very nice. 

 That truck never would have hit us if you kept your hands to yourself. Do you know that 
the cops yelled at me for letting you take control of my car? What the hell did they want 
me to do? Punch you in the face and shove you off of me? I wish I could have. Then maybe
I’d get to sleep at night.

 I think it’s time for you to go now. If you are trying to kill me, you’re doing a great job.
My body is fighting to stay awake everyday. I can’t bring myself to replay our fight again. 
Even though I wished you were joking, I knew you would never let go. You said you’d find a
way for us to be together. Forever. I never wanted to be with you to begin with. Even with 
your dying breath I never thought it would be this way. 

Now please, please just go away.

I just want to close my eyes.

Just for a little.

I typed up a much longer version of my question with more detail about the setting, but I'm simplifying it (perhaps too much) to make it more readable.  So here goes.

Basically, we have a planet (name suggestions welcome) governed by a single, very controlling, merit-based government (highly value intelligence).  This planet is a ticking time bomb.  It's going to self-destruct and no one knows how to stop it.  The government is planning on evacuating to nearby planets where they have a few bases set up, but they're only taking the highest social classes (in this society all the smart people) with them, leaving the rest to die.  They also haven't told the public about any of this because they don't want them to get in the way of the plan.

My main character (female) is part of a rebel group that works against the government and tries to fight against their totalitarianism.  She/they find out about the countdown and the government's plan and try to get everyone out in time.

What I need is a way for them to find out.  A few of them would be talented hackers and they would be regularly peeking into government files just to see what's up, so that's one thing I considered, but most likely info that they're so eager to keep from the public would be restricted to the highest levels and that would be out of reach.  I also thought about having the officials come to her (main character) because they need her help for something, but that raises the question of what, and why they would pick her.

Can I drink you in,

Without a compliant mouth?

My empty vessel desires emptiness,

Nothing exerts its control over nothing.

Partho thought he felt his hand brush against a dense patch of fur. He gasped and quickly quieted himself as the silence sat itself back down to a constant reverberating hum. The confusion brought about by waking up into a world of complete darkness is unparalleled in our human existence, where do you even begin to rebuild everything you have grown to learn? This was not blackness mind you; black implies color, absorption of all wavelengths of light to reflect a hue darker than grey and lighter than white. This was just…absence. Absence of everything, presence of none. There was no light to be absorbed, and nothing to absorb it either.
 Groping around, Partho realized that the fur was just a trick of the mind. Not preoccupied with any stimulation provided by the 'outside', his brain started creating its own sensations to entertain itself. The fucking fuck, bored with nothing, it aims to create a something, regardless of how it plays with its own creator's circuitry. I say 'a' something because it can be absolutely anything, from a fang-toothed, gorilla-chasing giant ant, covered in twisting, symbiotic streaks of neon purple and green and yellow and oh my god it's beautiful…where was I again? Oh right…to a random patch of fur. Now that he thought about it, Partho couldn't even feel his hands, let alone touch something. He tried to feel his face with his left hand, but instead felt it go right through where his nose should have been. Or maybe his nose went through where his hand should have been. He tried again, this time seeking to place his right hand on his left ankle. Again, nothing. He strained to consciously arrive at the nervous centre that controlled his right hand, and found it somewhere in his frontal lobe. He was completely aware of that arm, the nerves the sinews, bones, and all that fun stuff. But he just could not feel it. It wasn't some sort of loss of muscular control, no. His hand, his ankle, nose, they just weren’t there! Nothing was there. Just awareness, without anything to be aware of. 
After a while of arbitrary thoughts and imaginary sensation, Partho started debating himself on whether he was actually enjoying his current predicament more than another 'usual' day. He pretty much isolated himself from the world either way, finding solace in the unhindered, dreamy romance of poetry. Was it enough though? Without thesis there is no antithesis. Without day there is no night, without state there is no church, without love there is no hate, and without the world there is no art. 
Partho didn't know if he was an isolated brain floating around, or whether he was just going through a few moments of relative madness, everyone does. Maybe he was dead. Being locked alone with nothing but your crazed mind is a pretty damn good approximation of what hell is probably like, so he assumed himself to be there.

Anyway, critiques and input are more than welcomed. (I do not plan to take up smoking by the way, just wanted the experience as cigarettes have always been a mental block of mine)

--------------
May 15th, 2012; I am 20 years old, anxiously waiting in line to move up towards the register to purchase my first cigarette. My heart stops briefly as I pull my filled grocery cart and take up my spot to face the cashier. “Marlboro Lights.” I am surprised that the words come out without stuttering.  I throw the new box into one of the plastic bags full with food and walk out to my car. The drive home feels shorter than usual. 
It is 8:00 PM and there’s a downpour.  After organizing my food I walk to my apartment’s back door, giddily removing the clear cellophane wrapper from the golden box. Opening the top exposes the grid of white cylinders. They look more pristine than I had imagined. I slowly pull one stick out and after a short inspection place it gently into my pocket along with a black lighter. I open my back door as cold, moist wind hits my face and I catch a glance at the apartment opposite mine doing the same. Three young men carry chairs out with them and I notice each with their own cigarette in hand. I pretend to check my garbage-can for a minute before cowering back inside. Minutes pass and I peek through my blinds to happily find the men have left. 
I escape into the back porch once more to again be greeted by the rain’s cold, harsh air. The wind is angled and the roof is not enough to prevent the rain from tickling my feet. The apartment opposite mine now displays a full ashtray, resting atop a small wooden coffee table. A gust blows out the lighter on my first attempt.  I have to protect the flame with my hand. The gentle, gray vapors shield my eyes as I take my first drag. I am surprised at how difficult it is to pull air and equally surprised at how harsh each breath felt in my chest, but I don’t cough. I feel proud.  Exhaled smoke only has time to linger for a second before being violently jerked by a changing gale and fading into the background. The length of the cigarette shortens as I try my hardest to look natural as I tap the ashes off. There was room for only one more puff. The tip crumpled slightly in my fingertips as the heat from the smoke reached the now brown colored filter. I brush the rest on the damp concrete floor as one last ember escapes momentarily from danger. I run the cigarette butt under the sink before tossing it in the trash. Seconds later, taking my pizza out of the oven nearly sets my apartment on fire.

The only problem is, you sit there wondering if she’s thinking the same thing, too. You wonder how much *you* cross her mind, if at all, and that could be enough to push someone over the edge. At least it can for me. The only thing that keeps me holding on to sanity is that look she gives when she or I enter the room. Occasionally accompanied with a smile, the dilation of her pupils can say a lot. Many times I miss it. But who can blame me? The color that surrounds them steals the show. Even though I could pick them out of a line up, I don’t think I could correctly name the color. A light blue? A shade of grey? Possibly a combination of both. I checked her I.D. to see if it was listed, but it failed to mention anything.

She has the kind of beauty that many don’t, or rather choose to cover up with layers of foundation and liners of sorts. It’s almost effortless for her, or maybe that’s just how it seems.

After several instances of me denying that I’ve changed, you’ll start to believe it all. The phone calls will stop, as well the texts. Our only form of communication will be the “random” visits of facebook pages. You’ll want to call, but won’t, hoping I will make the first move. Which won’t happen, I never do. You’ll start to tell your friends and family what I’ve done, or in this case, what I haven’t done. Titles like ‘the one’ will be replaced with ‘asshole’ and ‘jerk’.

For the next day or two you will try to occupy your time but you’ll always come back to that one thought, ‘what did I do wrong?’ Don’t worry though, you didn’t do anything, but you'll never know that. How could you know that one of my biggest fears is being hurt or that commitment comes in a close second? Everything that went wrong was merely a defense mechanism. And all this happens for what? Love?

So to answer your question, yes, I do mind if you sit next to me. Because I will make you laugh, and I’ll probably say something you want to hear. You may even sleep with me tonight. We will hang out a couple of times, we may even date. You'll take me home to meet your parents and they will love me because, lets be honest, I'm incredibly charming.

So naturally, among other things; we the many and few souls left with some form of light in our eyes cling to the ever ending dream of something more. 

The dream? Shit, it's simple; find something better other than ending up as another empty husk in this godforsaken town. To escape, be free, to one day just up and leave with the roar of the road and bike beneath me. Like I said dreams. 

If it’s not the drugs or the booze that gets you it's the grey-scale vacant life that kills you. You see it all the time , good kid growing up , hits 15 and suddenly realizes this worlds just a pile of shit so what options the guy have ? Slim and none. You tell me the last time a child changed the world. 

Instead he gets angry and lashes out , raises some hell and figures "" fuck you guys I'm not going end up like you"" ten fifteen years later look at the same man , wife , kids of his own , bad drinking habit just like his daddy dearest an just about ready to blow his brains out like every other drone before him.

If you haven't realized it yet, histories play button's stuck on repeat. 
So then this story and what's it about? Simple, this is my story of how I broke the cycle and then great monster of the abyss dragged me all the back down. 

Growing up I was the same as every other kid, goofy haircut, stupid friends and loving family. After school I'd go ride my bike in our version of jumps and pretend we were BMX champions. You know, normal kid shit. 

Nothing really changed till I hit that magic age. That age when your eyes open and begin to see the creature that you call home for what it really is. 

I'd always like to think Frankenstein’s Monster was the town I grew up in. It wasn't that it was a bad place full of bad people, more the lost, damned and misguided all thrown into one sentient body , or something like that. 

At the time of our awakening there were four of us. Me, Andrew, Eric and Clair. We grew up together; Andrew and Clair were twins that lived next door. Eric, well Eric had he's own special naughty chair at preschool, in the corner across from mine. Once upon a time we had been thick as thieves, the four of us I mean. 

It was Andrew and Clair's 15th birthday things started going array. Just something about her was bit more eye catching than beforehand, Eric picked up on it first I honestly swear at one point his entire world was her for a split second moment, until I threw some cake at him for the fun of it. 

After the birthday party Eric and I convinced the twins to sneak out and have our own little celebrations elsewhere.Yeah, cause that was such a good idea to start with. Both Eric and I nicked a bit of our parents booze, I pinched a bottle of whiskey and Eric stole his mums champagne. 

Christ it tasted horrible, Andy had 3 mouthfuls threw up and passed out, the champagne didn't last long, Eric went through half the bottle tripped and smashed it. Clair wasn't that keen on drinking but naturally we hassled her till she gave in. Two sips of the whiskey and she said she was hot and needed to lie down, I used my jacket as a pillow and she laid in my lap and fell asleep. 

Looking back on things I'm surprised I didn't realize the look on Eric's face, I think I drifted off into the same place he did back at the party. If I concentrate hard enough I can still smell her shampoo.

""Anno Peractio: Age of Conclusion"" (tentative title) is a [series of artworks and scribbles (imgur album)](http://imgur.com/a/UawPc#0) I've been fostering for nigh on a decade. Born of an initial hobby of world-building. Only in these past couple of years did I decide to put my little universe into story form.

I've never studied English formally. Ever. My English comes from day to day interaction with speakers when I was younger as well as all the books I've read over the years.

That said, I'm trying to emulate a quasi-classic writing style in the story (i.e bad grammar that is no longer applicable... or never was). The setting is mainly science fantasy, set in a world far removed from ours, where magic and science go hand in hand. It tells the story of Man's collective struggle in the face of extinction at the hands of dreadful dragons from beyond time and space. At least, that's the gist of it.

I'd really love to hear your opinions on my writing style, scene pacing, and—most importantly—if I've managed to set a theme without confusing the hell out of y'all.

Have at it. [[Anno Peractio - Chapter I: Advent]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1THqs6jn_T_Vy6zNAR459QPZwNm2ABxVa9zsPwa_Yyjs/edit?usp=sharing)

&gt;In the beginning, our Universe was static; a singular point containing all of space and energy, resting amidst nothing. Time, at this point, stood still. Everything was contained, held, frozen, and we existed in this state forever or for no time at all. But then something stirred our primordial soup, and the first tick of the Universal clock echoed through the planes of unconsciousness. The arrow of time had turned its head and set into motion, driven by one truth; the expansion of all that is, the tearing and pulling and separating of our very fabric. All that was grew, stretching its limbs outward. Like water runs across the surface of a stone filling every pore, our primal form expanded into the cracks of oblivion. And like the stems and shoots and roots bursting from a seed, the growth of the Universe accelerated and life became. Stars were born; they spun amongst fields of dust and gas and fed their child planets, who spiralled gently into the hearts of their mothers.  Stars died; throwing their seeds across the Universe like a dandelion under the breath of earthly winds, and life was reborn. But as entropy tears through our Universe, everything becomes more and more separated, more and more distant. Until, finally, the last atom creaks and slows to a halt; the arrow of time once more falls from flight and life and consciousness freezes, like the flower closing in winter’s frost, waiting for its rebirth to be fuelled by the rising sun. In the end, our Universe is static; an infinite field containing all of space and energy, resting amidst nothing. Time, at this point, stands still. Everything is contained, held, frozen, and we exist in this state forever or for no time at all. But then something stirs our entropic darkness, and the first tick of the Universal clock once again echoes through the planes of unconsciousness. The arrow of time turns its head and reverses its course, driven by one truth; the contraction of all that is, the converging and fusing of our very fabric. All that is shrinks, drawing its limbs inward. Like water runs toward the lowest point, collecting as a single drop, our ultimate form collapses inside the cracks of oblivion. Until, finally, the last atom once again creaks and slows to a halt.

On the day he could stand he crept out of his bed and felt the sores on his back and legs from the mattress. They were raw and itchy and he desperately desired a bath. Tani washed his upper body when she thought he was sleeping. The water always woke him and she scurried off instantly.

His stink was unbearable and he hobbled to the water bucket she fetched for him and knelt, slowly, to rinse off his hair and splash it on his arms and chest. He looked about for a bar of lye but found nothing. He’d go ask for some, and perhaps a tub if they had one. *Perhaps she can fetch hot water too.* Delighted by the thought of a hot bath, he walked gingerly to the door of the house and opened the latch.

He heard voices the moment he creaked the door open and paused there, suddenly afraid. *Have they come looking for me? Has she given me to the Mossfields? I bet they will pay plenty for my hide then ransom me back to my father for twice that.* He wondered if his father would pay the ransom. His stomach turned and he had the sinking feeling he would not. “I have no son,” he’d say. “I bore a coward instead.”

But these voices were not men’s. He soon realized one of them was Tani, speaking in soft whispers to a much older woman. The girl sounded worried, her voice shaking like she’d been crying. Leaning against the wall for support, he listened, trying to catch their words. *Are they plotting to sell me? Send me off?*

“…needs them more than I,” the older woman said before a violent cough erupted. He wondered how he had not heard that cough before.

“He’s a stupid boy, I’d rather… I’d rather give him boiling oil!” Tani’s voice was a whisper but he heard its anger. “Please nana, take the potion. I mixed it good, like you show me. It will make you strong.”

“He is a noble, you owe him your best.”

“He’s not no noble, I found him under a hedge.”

“You told me his name little one,” the old woman coughed again and her wheeze took some time to return to normal breathing. “His is the blood of Gareth Halloway, lord of these lands.”

“You’ve said nana,” Tani said with a sigh. The older woman made a groaning sound. “Did I now? How many times, child?”

“Four,” Tani replied. “We’ve said this all four times.”

“My mind is old and weak. Soon I will be gone.”

“Stop that nana, you will get better. Drink the potion.”

The words became so soft and muttered that Paul couldn’t hear any more. He frowned and felt his neck and cheeks redden. *Is there no man in this house? Is there only a sick old woman and the girl? Who does all the work?* He thought of how Tani came in to his room to feed him, change his bandages and how she would carry out the feed bags. She couldn’t possibly do it all herself. She would never sleep. The girl always looked tired to him, with permanent rings beneath her eyes. More shame burned in his chest and heated his cheeks. He remembered her mentioning chores and his balking refusal. *I was too weak then, that’s all. I was too weak. Does she really do all this work herself?*

Paul heard Tani begin to move about inside the house and he went back to his bed as quickly as he could. He only managed to sit when she got to the door and opened it. For a moment she looked at the latch, realizing the door was open. She gave him a careful look and chewed on her cheek. “You been up and walkin’ then?”

“Just to the door and back,” he said. Lying felt stupid and so he added, “And to the water bucket. I… am in need of a bath.” Tani’s hard-edged eyes twinkled with amusement for a moment and even smirked. “That you do, Thegn Stinky.” The jibe made his cheeks grow hot and he opened his mouth to scold her but she bowed her head first. “Pardon.”

Paul felt his heart sink. “Tani,” he said, realizing it was the first time he spoke the name aloud. It sounded pretty to the ear. She blinked and looked at him. “Are you alone here? Just yourself and your…”

“Nana,” she said but took no step towards him. “It was her and grandfather’s farm. After me da died, ma died in childbirth you see, I came here with them.” *Died in childbirth, like my own mother.* He looked at her again, more closely this time. She had a strong jaw and her shoulders were muscled, her arms taut and corded. Her hips were thin and bust small, a laborer’s physique. *She’s a tough girl*, he realized. *Tougher than I am.*

Silence pervaded for several long moments before Tani shifted her gaze to the water bucket and the twisted her mouth into a thoughtful frown. “I’ll draw a bath for you. Water won’t be greatly warm I imagine.” She didn’t ask him if that was okay but simply stalked back inside the main house and pulled the door shut. Paul found himself waiting for almost an hour before Tani came back. Her hair was wet and tied into a knot behind her head with a cord and she looked rather miserable. “What happened to you?” he asked as she walked towards him, leaving the door open.

Her gaze felt sharper than the wood that had pierced his arm. She said nothing and took his arm in both of her hands. She wrinkled her nose. “You smell like the cow’s udders.” His face reddened and anger brewed beneath but deflated before he could really be mad at her. He did smell. He was having trouble standing it himself by now. Washday must have come and gone three times as he lay abed. With the girl’s help he was able to hobble his way to the door and then up over the single step that brought him into the main house.

1375395311.0,3,self.KeepWriting,1jiwuz,"[Feedback] Opening chapter of my fiction novel about a struggling photographer in New York, 1,088 words.",BNaloCacoC,7,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1jiwuz/feedback_opening_chapter_of_my_fiction_novel/,"This is the opening to my current novel, which is about a endeavoring photographer in New York who becomes obsessed with the work of another photographer, May Paul, and believes that her work holds the key to his struggles. But when she is murdered, he is forced to dive into the lives of the people she photographed in order to find answers. It is a story about childhood, adulthood, being in the spotlight, being an outcast, and grappling with feelings of being so alone in a city so full of people.

Thanks for taking the time to read it. Here you go:

May Paul’s face had been deconstructed by a bullet and all I could do was take a photograph and think about my personal deficiencies as her blood ran past my feet. We were both silent for a while. I could say it wasn’t her time to go, but it obviously was, I just wished it wasn’t. Her limp body and bald head spread across the stoop reminded me that between all of our worst moments, we are all rather normal—here meaning average, harmless, and for the most part acceptably productive. In truth, we find ourselves here, in this normal range, whether we admit it or not, substantially more than those places we are put into by such extreme moments. However, our worst moments have a way of shaping what our normal selves do and how we function. But perhaps—and arguably definitely—worse is the way in which our most unfavorable moments carry so much damn weight in determining how others perceive us, and how we all have a bad, unconscious habit of vindicating those who should be wrong about us.

We spend life looking at ourselves like we’re a stranger standing behind us. A person we watch in the reflection of a window, thinking the stranger can’t see us until he turns his head and makes eye contact with our reflection in the window and, while in reality we’re all just looking at a point on the glass, we are all looking at each other.

I met a girl with red hair while I was in college  at the University at Buffalo that reminded me of my mother. My mother didn’t have red hair, but then again neither did she. I just thought she did until her roots started to grow out when she was forced to wait a couple of extra week until she could afford to re-dye it; she was actually a blonde. She got too drunk while I was too sober at a party once. That sort of thing will depress the shit out of you on its own, just you and a loaded girl late at night, alone in a dark room as she alternates between laughing and crying about the people that never love her and the ones she wishes she could. But then you add in a house full of sauced, underaged drinkers with underdeveloped brains and things can get pretty twisted, or what some call a really good time. I remember her coming up to me and asking me to save her and to please take her home. I wish that was all I remembered—I still remember some of the thoughts that crossed my mind. I don’t talk about things like the things I thought about at that moment. Maybe it’s because I hope they’ll go away if I don’t turn them into words or maybe that they won’t really be a part of who I am if I don’t mention them. So instead, I talk my way around them and focus on the fact that I got her home safely and didn’t go inside. Or maybe I did go inside and I’ve just always told everyone I didn’t. And does that matter now? Sometimes I think back and wonder how much of what I know I’ve made up. Growing up, I learned the hard way that when you don’t have an answer for something you make one up. Nothing pissed my father off more than hearing I don’t know, so I learned to make sure I always knew something even if what I knew was based on nothing. 

It’s nights like that one with the redhead that make me think how easy it is to be a bad person and how bad you can be without anyone really knowing. But is a person truly made bad by the things they do or by the things they think about? And what is a bad person anyway?

I can’t count how many people I’ve touched or wanted to touch—and touch is a vague word, and in some ways the epitome of our vague language that relies so much on intent, context, and inflection—but every once in a while I stumble across an old note and remember how many people I’ve forgotten. Sometimes it doesn’t have to do with women at all, but rather with family and someone I used to be. I stumbled across a stack of old photographs in a briefcase when I was moving from Buffalo to Manhattan. I couldn’t quite tell what year they were from, but we were all at my grandmother’s house and she was there too, so they had to have been around a couple decades old.

Everyone looked so much younger, like they were from another time. A time before mine, when polaroids and clothes I’d never seen before were in full swing. Thinner too. And so much color in everyone’s hair, like they’d never go grey. Sometimes, when I look at a photograph, I like to think that there is some place where those people still exist; people tend to change so fast—for better or worse, intentionally or not—that it seems like whenever you look at a photograph, you’re never looking at who a person is, maybe just who they were. It took me a while to realize that my parents were my age in the photographs. My mother looked happy, it must have been a good Christmas—she often didn’t fare well through the last months of the year. Then again, pictures can be so misleading; someone points a camera at your face and tells you to smile and you do, even if you don’t have much to smile about. Maybe that’s why it’s important to have cameras at events and gatherings, so we can always rely on some reason to smile and because sometimes the simple act of smiling can remind us to be happy. We forget that we were told to smile, carrying on as if the grin came about naturally.

You don’t see many cameras at funerals. Sometimes people don’t want an excuse to smile and, despite what they might tell you about how badly they want to be happy, they’ll only really be happy once they are successful in feeling as bad as they think they’re supposed to feel. Cameras just confuse them and remind them of cheerful times in which the smiled. Now cameras just remind me of May Paul. And Robyn. And the photographs that were stolen from me.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1jiwuz,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1jiwuz/feedback_opening_chapter_of_my_fiction_novel/,
1375389579.0,4,self.KeepWriting,1jip5m,A paragraph of description of a very attractive girl,ascenzion,13,9,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1jip5m/a_paragraph_of_description_of_a_very_attractive/,"Disclaimer: I knocked this together in ten or so minutes after reading an askreddit thread on attractive womens' descriptions in literature. 

In my current story the protagonist has just ran into an antagonist female, soon to become a protagonist. She is meant to be very, remarkably, somewhat ridiculously, attractive. Mixed race 3/4Mexican-1/4American. She is 20ish, as is the protagonist describing her. 

I understand the following is excessive and grandiose/pretentiously descriptive. I just wondered what you guys thought about it anyway. 

*She looked like the sun. It wasn't the glint of beams shining through the ocean's warm evening twilight, the rays shaving across the architecture of her cheekbones like a midday radiance splayed across the Parthenon; it wasn't the mahogany hair that wafted skywards on the swell of the sea air, challenging even the strongest will with the restraint needed to not reach out and capture a fleeting brush of the threads against skin, like a tangible, autumn cloud. It wasn't her lithe, gracious form, standing strong on the edge of the stone wall as the saltwater lapped across the soles of her feet in appreciation. It was the overwhelming feeling of provenance he felt as he regarded her in front of him. This is the specimen of humanity. This is a being so perfect she inspires not lust, but reverence; she was the depiction, the culmination of millennia of generations, of the rudimentary and most basic symbol of creation. Just as the sun has flaws, spots that remind us it is indeed corporeal, so did she; the almost imperceptible blemish of her once-broken nose, the quiescent wound on her upper arm, all signs of a human with the innate, and most important, trait of vulnerability. Her palpable imperfections, like our star, were what made her so unequivocally, fundamentally, unsurpassable and imperative. She was imperfectly perfect- the best, and only, kind of perfect.*

I walked out of the elevator and towards the door, straightening out my dress one last time, taking almost cat-like steps so as not to let my sneakers make the tiniest noise against the porcellanato floor. I rang three times, like always, half hoping there would be no one to answer and I could just go back to the comfort of my tiny apartment, being able to say I did my part by showing up after all, so it wasn’t my fault that we didn’t get to meet, no hard feelings.

Alas, there was no such luck.

“Hi, Lily!!!” How are you??? It’s so good to see you, come on in!!!” Silvia exclaimed after opening the door. She was a tall woman with bottle-blond hair and a body that no doubt took a lot of time and money to accomplish. She wore tight jeans, a gray shirt and a leather jacket with a little faux fur, plus high-heeled boots that made her taller than she already was, which was intimidating to little me.

“Hi,” I said, trying to put on my best social smile while the woman pulled me in for a hug and a kiss. Once inside, I looked down the hall. “Where’s Tony?” I asked.

“Hey Dalí”, I heard a male voice say, and soon I was with my feet up in the air, gasping for breath under his warm but killer embrace, which I attempted to return rather weakly. My brother liked to tease me, but there was some sincerity to his gesture, or at least that’s what I hoped. “You arrived just in time,” he said as he finally let me back on the ground. “Dinner’s ready.”

It was a truly remarkable lasagna. Veggie for the girlfriend, regular for the brother and with no vegetables at all for the sister. I knew how to cook to live off something other than takeout without poisoning myself or starving, but Tony was a true chef.

“How come you don’t eat any vegetables at all?” Silvia asked me. “They’re delicious!”

“I’ve never eaten them.”

“She can’t stand the smell. Or the flavor,” Tony continued. “It’s been that way since we were little.”

“Well, it’s a shame. You don’t know what you’re missing.”

“You don’t eat meat. Or things that aren’t diet,” I pointed out. “Different strokes for different folks, I guess.”

“I guess you’re right,” she conceded. “I just made the resolution to eat clean, you know? Food is more than food. It’s fuel for your mind and body, and I’ve decided to take care of my body, to make it look and feel its best. Eating clean, going to the gym, that’s how I keep myself like this. Right, honey?”

“That’s right, babe.”

I couldn’t deny it was working very well for her. She made a good-looking couple with my dear, handsome brother, whether I liked it or not. Her model looks matched his reddish brown hair and blue eyes, plus he was one of the few guys who could tower over her, even with her high heels. A couple right out of the fucking social pages of a magazine, really.

“I like the gym,” I mustered.

“I can tell,” Silvia said. “You have a very nice body, and that face…"" she said, pinching my cheek until all the blood from my body concentrated there. ""If only you would let me give you a makeover… change your clothes, dye your hair, give you a brand new attitude… All the guys would be dying to get you, I promise. No one would be able to resist your charm ever.”

Tony slammed his fork against the plate with a little too much force. “You haven’t gone to the police station in awhile, Dalí, why’s that?”

“They hadn’t sent much work for me lately, but I have a translation right now in the oven, and an interpreting job as well.”

“Come on, honey,” Silvia interrupted. “I can see how you get. You’ve sheltered her too much her whole life, she’s not a little girl. She’s a pretty woman, and with a couple of tweaks, a damn sexy one.” My brother winced a little. “See?” She said. “That thing that you do, right there. What’s up with that?”

“I’m not doing anything,” he replied. “I just wanna know how’s my little sister doing at work.”

“I’m doing very well,” I said. “I barely have any free time and the money’s great right now.”

“That’s awesome, Lily!” Silvia exclaimed in her characteristic saccharine voice. “This is a sample of everything the universe has to offer. God has a plan for everyone. I’m reading this book, and it’s so inspirational. Whatever you put into the Universe comes back to you. If you put good vibrations, you receive good vibrations in return. This is the Universe conspiring to get you what you want.”

I was about to say something, but Tony must have noticed, because he looked at me with his eyes open like plates and moved his head from one side to the other; so I just smiled, said “of course,” and went back to my lasagna, nodding as Silvia kept on talking about fairy dust and imaginary friends. 

I looked at my watch. It was time for my nightly drops, so I excused myself to go to the bathroom. I was never ashamed of the medicines I needed, but taking them made me feel vulnerable, and you can’t show your weaknesses in life, so taking them right on the dining table was out of the question.

I opened the cabinet to have some mouthwash and, behind the hair dye and various powders, I saw what looked like a secret compartment. I opened it, not without difficulty, and there was something odd in it: A brown unmarked bottle with a seemingly colorless liquid inside. The bottle itself seemed custom-made and quite pretty, I opened it and sniffed. The substance was odorless as well. What was it doing there? Tony would never take any drugs, and Silvia was a fan of everything homeopathic, but why would she need to hide her potions in such a way? I took my drops and tried to put it all in the back of my mind, to no avail.

### Paris, France, Outbreak Day 17

""Fuck that shit, I never enlisted to supervise civilians and burn houses, I muttered to myself, embracing my left handed FAMAS. Fuck that fucking shit!"". 

We'd been prepared though. They called us back from Mali and the Serval operation. They made us watch videos showing crazy motherfuckers beating poor dudes in Paris streets. They explained to us this was an ""aggressive"" mutation of the coronavirus. That London and Berlin definitely closed their borders, and were sending canned beef stew. Canned beef stew? They'd better nuke us right away. *This is France god damn it, send us ""confit de canard""*. They told us that our job was to contain this shit inside Paris porous borders. They admitted that we'd probably need to shoot civilians. I should have left at that exact moment. Kill a civilian? ""The Sick are not humans anymore"" they reassured. Sick or not, this was fucked up. But they promised action and honors. And most of all: it was an order. I asked questions though. ""We can afford to lose the only female of our regiment *Adjudant* Denis, I you know what I mean"", snapped my Lieutenant. Period. So I swallowed it. What a fucking transition from Mali's desert. And things were getting worse: it was raining for three days on my perfectly ironed outfit, and we had little to none information on what was going on outside our perimeter, in the South West of Paris. I patted my assault rifle. ""At least *you* won't let me down."" 

""*Adjudant* Denis, did someone asked you to rest"", questioned *Major* Duchaussoy, the highest NCO in my section, his clear eyes fixing the river, ""or are you looking the Seine because you think our flock can shamble on water?"" His stare turned back to me, ""Now look this way, and be sure no infected nor civilian gets in the bridge direction. It's been calm for now, but I'm expecting you to treat this mission like any other.""

-""Yes *Major*!"", my body straight, feet slightly spread, one hand behind my back and the other on my weapon grip. 

-""Very Good. Listen, I know this is not what you were expecting, after Congo, Afghanistan or Mali. I didn't expect it myself, but our mission is to serve and protect the civilians of our nation. If you're not comfortable with that anymore, I couldn't care less. Denis, listen and over listen, I know you, and if you move the wrong way, I'll make you miserable. You'll make us sandwiches while we fight."", he warned, trying to appear severe, his index pointing between my eyes. I repressed a smile. Sandwiches? Was he seriously threatening me with that? But I shut up. I was made to fight, serve and protect. I was a soldier, not a cook. Women cook. Cooks cook. Over trained soldiers like me fight. And Duchaussoy always did what he said. ""We're in the middle of something I don't really get yet. Brass and suits are shitting their pants in every goddamn city. Grunts don't think too much. Even over trained tools like us don't think too much. You got me?""

-""Yes *Major*!"". I could feel the eyes of my group on me. 

-""Very Good. So keep your attention on that bridge, on that street, and on everything between.""

He smiled at me with this warmth that made the fucker friendly, whatever the situation, replaced his red beret, turned around and left with his hands in his back. If there wasn't this damn rain, I swear I could hear him croon *""aux Champs Elysées""*. He continued his inspection, saluting, slapping backs, warning, giving orders, and most of all keeping everyone on the deck. I knew the man for a long time. I worked under his orders in every mission I did. And I did some, as the only female of the 17th RGP. I was supposed to represent women in the french army and all that bullshit. It always frustrated me that most non 17th RGP troops forgot that I did all the fucking training that was expected from me. That I'd done the same six months, from class theory to practice in the wilderness. That, I, too, was left abandoned in the jungle with my combat group, and survived. They always forgot that I finished first of my class, which is a prowess by itself. So I did Congo. And Afghanistan. And showed again I deserved to be a soldier of the 17th RGP during the Serval Operation in Mali. That I was fit to defend the Nation. That seemed far now. *There's no way I'll shoot civilians*, I reassured myself, my eyes wandering again on the distant Eiffel Tower.  

The *Gazelles* were turning around the Garigliano Bridge for almost an hour now. With the heavy rain, it was hard to hear the high speed rotation of their three blades, even if we could see their typical bubble head from our standing point. They were controlling that the bridge was safe, and doing so for a few days now. This bridge was a span to freedom for the Parisians. Going through it meant no curfews anymore, no burning houses, no crazy mother fucker beating your wife and kids while its fellows were eating your internals. But before that? You needed to wait hours, maybe days, in line, and then go through medical examination. Eyes, mouth, nails, breath, respiration, temperature, asshole were controlled, checked, double checked. Before the bridge? Hell. After? Immaculate hell. If it appeared that you were perfectly sane, you could wander where the fuck you wanted to. Kind of a program. I wondered if that's why we all signed for? Control civilians? Maybe kill civilians? Burn  houses? *There's no way I'll shoot civilians*, I repeated to myself, like a mantra. Unexpectedly the two helicopters slowly descended, their lateral doors opened, the standard third passenger speaking through a megaphone. That never smelled good in any operation I participated to.

""Shi', civs' are tryin' to break out the bridge post"", excitedly pointed Roux, a dumb first class of our twenty four strong souls section. *Gazelles* were really low now, only few meters above the bridge. Duchaussoy ran toward us. He hadn't his beret anymore. His cask was on. The air already smelt powder. ""Soldiers, Stand At!"" Hands clasped against the thighs. ""Bridge called us. They guarantee being in such a deep shit that even *Commandant Cousteau* could not help them. I know you all secretly think ""Chasseurs Alpins"" are pussies, and it's time to show the world you're right."" Chuckles. He ignored and continued, one hand on his left hip the second pointing the bridge. ""Listen boys, seventy meters from here, a post. Seventy one meters from here, civilians trying to cross the same damn post without authorization. Two hundred meters from here, no civilians any more. I'm not a damn cop, I don't know how to estimate the amount of people on this bridge, but it's plenty. Intel informed us that roughly eight hundred meters from the bridge, a crowd of civilians mixed with the savages are literally overwhelming every section of the 3rd RIMa there. Their general direction *seems* to be our side of the river. In approximately twenty minutes, the two crowds will join. We have nineteen minutes to be between them."" I looked at second class Royer and second class Clément. They seemed as ready and hungry for action as me. ""Gentlemen, I know those people are civilians, but we are allowed to fire. Try to aim at the barbarians, and spare the sane, but don't put your comrades at risk. Shoot everyone that doesn't stop when asked. 1^st^ Company *les forbans*, in the north of Paris has been overwhelmed one hour ago because they didn't shoot to kill, which seems weird, because they're not the kind to think hard before triggering."" Chukles sounded discomfortable now. ""So shoot…"", a COUGAR, the huge french army transportation helicopter, was in approach, and the Major had to shout to finish, "".. shoot to kill. Am I clear enough? Shoot to kill. Brass and suits both agree on this: infected are not citizens anymore, whatever the hell that means, and right now, we're the highest asset in a country that hates its army so much.""

The helicopter landed smoothly, creating small waves of water under it, and the doors opened. A soldier emerged and ran to the Major. Duchaussoy nodded, and told our group to embark. ""OK gentlemen, the two other groups of the section will join you in a couple, so you'll be first in line, what do you say?"". The eight of us echoed: ""Thank you sir!"". We climbed in the *COUGAR*, each of us granted with a knock on our cask by one of the crew members. The vehicle took off. I guess the exact term should have been ""blasted off"", as a premonitory event.

The body that once gave me joy for having me was a living thing one day, a beautiful entity created to guide the people towards their happiness. Their words in our Book, almost poetry. Most outside think of it that way. To the rest it&amp;rsquo;s a stern mother who, while not tender nor gentle, strives for the well-being of all.

Unbeknownst to all, however, the lovely but severe mother was stabbed and killed long ago. It remained alive while also being dead.

I was shown it first. All I did was expose the wound.

Beneath the pretty skin, rotten flesh is all there is, maggots, worms, festering bowels full of stagnant waste. All the external fairness now makes me sicker than I&amp;rsquo;d be if it had a diseased face.

We have the best morticians in the world. There&amp;rsquo;s barely a smell.

It&amp;rsquo;s been there all along if you knew where to look, but a sweet soothing perfume covers all. The scent of harmony &amp;mdash; of *the face of Harmony.* Now that I know the truth, however, no fragrance could ever hide the stench from me. Now that I can see past the makeup, I&amp;rsquo;m aware of the pus seeping from the cracks.

Whoever scribbled this note knew of it before me. But how did they? Who and where are they? I can&amp;rsquo;t see why they&amp;rsquo;ve chosen me. I know nothing of their intentions, of their methods.

I want answers, but I don't believe I&amp;rsquo;ll live long enough to have them. That&amp;rsquo;s why my head is now filled with &amp;ldquo;what ifs.&amp;rdquo; The damage is done, but what if I&amp;rsquo;d done nothing? What if the world becomes worse now? Could it have lasted the way it was? What if I&amp;rsquo;d just waited?

Introduction:


It was a cold winter and a young boy named Olsten sat at the age of eight during the holliday of the cold times. The cold times started when the first snow arrived in the major green lands. The Holliday was 20 days from the First snowfall starting the cold times.He saw the fire start to lower and dim and he went around the house to gather some fire wood. He put on his sweater and told his mother and father. He walked knee deep in snow as he trudged around the house when he heard a roar. He looked up to see a dragon large and glittering he froze in the snow and noticed it was coming towards him. His father ran out of the house apon hearing the roar and shielded Olsten with a danger in hand Olstens mother ran out as well and grabbed Olsten who was sitting there jaw dropped as the dragon flew down and grabbed his father by the legs. His dad stabbed what he could reach and thrust the dagger into the beasts eye which caught flame. Olsten's father pulled the dagger out and way about to stab again when the dagger flew out of his hands with a violent shake from the dragon. The dagger flew down only a couple meters from where Olsten was standing and instantly the snow around it melted. He ran and grabbed it and his mother quickly picked him back up and dragged him into the trees and snow as the dragon finished off Olstens father and crushed there house to pieces.



Chapter one: Farrow's Cranny

In a land by the name of Veiron, the territory of Rosewater lied, it was one of the lesser known territories and only contained 3 towns where all scattered in the lower part of the Lesser green lands that was the territory of rosewater. one of these towns went by the name of Farrow's cranny. It was a small place of only up to 60 cabins lieing about. Two years after his mothers death from the coughing sickness (as they had named a sickness that ravaged the land which was often associated with dangerously painfully coughing)  Olsten Liat who you must already know of from introduction. sat on his favorite seat in his cabin and set his feet out towards the fire. He sipped a cup of warm coffee as he watched a fly buzz around the corner. Tiredly he sat his head back against the top of his chair and began  to dose. He was near asleep when a knock awoke him from his trance. He didn't quite recognize the knock, it was loud and hard. Not like the usual messenger or one of his friends. He yawned and stretched his back while the knocks kept coming he opened the door and a large man came bustling in. He recognized the man from the ""horse and rook"" tavern he often went to drink wine and relax. ""Mr. Gregor? Is it?"" he asked the man as he walked straight past Olsten and started to look around ""Gorger's my name"" he said quickly flashing his face back to Olsten. ""has anything out of the ordinary happened  in Your house hold?"" asked Gorger almost angrily ""no sir, but might I ask what is your business here?"" asked Olsten quietly. He thought Gorger hadn't heard the question but before he could repeat it Gorger interrupted ""Bandits are in town, some came in and snuck about, we think they where shape changers, ghosts or some other type of small or translucent beast. Some people heard some sounds and found things of value missing just after a scout reported bandits."" Olsten chuckled slightly but Gorger kept his cold hard stare of him. ""creatures like shape changers? Even if they did exist why would they come to Farrow's Cranny?"" he was skeptical, he wasn't sure about this Gorger guy. ""listen we need to get everybody out of the village towards the cove, leave your stuff here, just bring what you absolutly need. We don't want the bandits following us just because someone decided to bring an expensive necklace or something."" the cove was some huge cave they found behind a waterfall on the main river through the lesser green lands and filled with supplies and food. ""but i am in but a robe!"" Olsten cried loudly. Gorger grumbled as Olsten rushed to his  bedroom and changed into a mishmash of clothing. ""Hurry you petal picking twat!"" yelled gorger from the other room. Olsten rushed out of his room and the two made for the door . He followed Gorger out of the house and looked back once to see the fly buzzing about the room. 

As Gorger and Olsten furthered the  space between the town and themselves something was happening in Olstens house. The fly sat on the chair for a bit, for anyone with an untrained eye it looked like a ordinary fly looking for some food scraps to gorge itself on but if you looked close you'd notice a dash of neon blue in the flies eye. The fly or should we just call it a shape changer grew in size. It got larger and larger until it slowly started to change a dull pink. Some arms grew and other shrunk and shriveled away. At the end a human like figure stood in the center of the room. The woman, who went by the name Jenine was of the shape shifter race. They where rare creatures, always traveling and using there skills for cheating and stealing, they where barely unrecognizable from humans apart from there pupils being light blue and being unreasonably pale. Jenine  scoffed in disgust at the cabin and dusted her self off and went into Olstens room. She threw some clothes on and got to work stealing. Olsten had nothing of to much interest in his house. She took some crystals that Olsten had found and some of his silver ware. By now Jenine could hear some yelling out side. ""there's nothin here anyways she grumbled and grabbed a walking stick. She hit one of the still burning logs out of the fire towards the center of the room. Fire spread across the floor boards as Janine 
made her way out the door. She stopped as she saw a glint through the fire near the floor boards. She stomped the fire out in that part and reached down and picked up a silver eager with strange writing on it. She smiled to herself and walked out the door. Before long Olstens house was burning down just as the other houses followed.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1372804181.0,,,True,t3_1hizr8,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1hizr8/yet_to_be_named_olsten_trilogy_just_felt_like/,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We got off the bus that was directly infront of the train station. We had to skip sixth period in order to get here on time. Aiden and I were still in our school uniform. Nothing fancy, just a pair of blue slacks and a white top. I had my doubts in regards to the plan we were about to execute. We lived in the poorer area of our city. Our station was surrounded with violence, drugs and thugs. It was rare not to see a fight after school or someone being hustled for money; but Aiden and I grew up here. This was our home. We had to walk through the underpass to the other side of the station. 

I hated this underpass. It was like Sodom, the city of sin. If you looked like easy prey, then the thugs would jump you or hustle you for money. It's easy to tell if someones not from around here. When you grow up around fear and intimidation being a crucial factor in social interactions, you can pick up on it very, very easily. 

As I walked through the underpass I could smell the piss and the alcohol the lingered along the walls and the ground. They had recently installed circular mirrors that showed the corners of the underpass to make it safer, just in case someone was waiting to rob you.

We walked up to the 3rd platform and waited. The train from Beltenham finally came. 
We waited at the front of the gates where everyone had to pass in order to leave. A large group of people had exited the train. 

""What does he look like Aiden?"" I asked.

""Your height, asian, black spikey hair with golden tips. Ugly mug."" He replied still on the look out.

""Why are we looking for him again? What did he do?""

""Said I was a weak cunt."" Aiden replied still focusing on the large group that just exited the train. ""And he said you're a small fucker that needs me to protect you."" 

I clenched my fist. Aiden suddenly shouted that he saw the guy. We walked up and Aiden grabbed his shoulder. The guy turned around and Aiden hit him in the face, again and again. People hurried their steps and did not intervene. It was the social norm for our community to leave these types of situations be and not step in.

""Come with us cunt,"" Aiden said commanding the guy.

We dragged him to a nearby park and Aiden told him to drop his bag. I stood next to Aiden arms folded and stared at the guy. Aiden told him to kneel down. The guy obeyed immediately. Aiden slapped him around,whilst boosting his own ego.

""You know who I am cunt? You talked shit to the wrong mother fucker. You called my friend a small fucker didn't you?""

Not waiting for an answer, Aiden kicked the guy to the ground and yelled at him to get back up. 

""Don't ever talk shit about us ever again,"" Aiden said.

The guy looked miserable. It was the eyes of humiliation. I knew he would never talk shit again. Being bashed once by someone who is crazy is once too many. As Aiden and I left, I looked back to see the guy still sitting there. He was looking at the ground. It was like deja vu. I had seen this too many times before. Aiden and I would bash someone so hard they would be in shock and sit there for 10 to 20 minutes just staring. You don't just stand up and walk away. You sit and you mull over the events. You feel angry that you couldn't do anything and you want to cry but you can't. You're in shock.
This guy won't talk shit but there will be another guy who will, and another guy that will have to learn his lesson. It's just a matter of time until someone does. 

*If you were wondering, this was based on a true story - I was not Aiden or the partner, or the victim. 

*I don't condone or think violence is cool and I am not a fan of teenage hormone fueled violence. It's something that I like to share and express to others to show them how unnecessary violence and conflict is.

I begin counting down in my head. The rocket breaks through a veil of clouds, devastating the natural peace as the engines consume the vapors. The shell begins to shake as if gripped by a giant, one small squeeze and the great vessel would be no more. Tightly secured by a harness, I hardly feel a thing, but I know there is no problem, these are just some atmospheric winds. “Stage separation commencing” uttered the computer once more, moments before a sharp jolt  echoes out throughout the ship as the clasps break away and the ship begins it’s graceful climb up through the atmosphere. “Please don’t fail” I murmured quietly to myself. There was no point in saying anything, the whole flight was completely automated and I was the only one on board. But nonetheless, I was still afraid. But fear was, of course, just a silly human condition. Creaking, the separated engine stage fell away from the ship and, assisted by the hunger of gravity, it plummeted down out of view. Looking out of the window, wisps of vapor flew past as the final cloud layer was breached and silence began to surround the ship.

Nothingness was everywhere. Blackness surrounded the small shuttle as it silently flew through the vacuum of space. The moment could have gone on forever had it not been broken by the RCS thrusters activating, steering the shuttle into a course for the Station. Within seconds the ship was blasting through the night sky as it made up for the distance between itself and the Station. A few minutes later I caught a glimpse of a large solar panel, reflecting sunlight onto a rotating body. I was nearly there. It seemed to be hanging by strings, a celestial puppet, floating above the Earth without falling. A window caught the light of the sun and glared brightly in my direction, momentarily blinding me from the epic and my undoubtedly last view of my home planet, Earth.

*A lazy Sunday morning.* The thought sounded wonderful to Daniel as he sat at on the couch and watched reruns of “I Love Lucy.”

“How do steaks sound for this afternoon, dear,” he inquired.

“Perfect.”

Lorena smiled that loving smile as Daniel looked around for his cleanest Hanes no tag tee-shirt to head to the store. He settled on the blue one and set off on his mission. As he deliberately parked his vintage Station Wagon, the tunes of Motley Crue filled his ears.

While looking through his Clark Kent style prescription glasses at the meat selection he had difficulty finding exactly what he needed. Thirty bucks for two rib-eyes? Fuck me. He eventually settled on the 2 pack of New York strip steaks, grabbed a bag of charcoal, and headed to the check-out line.

As he placed his small basket on the conveyor belt to head towards the check-out girl, he couldn’t help but to notice a snarl come across the young girl’s face. Before reaching for the steaks, she slipped a plastic bag around her hand and stretched it towards the blood stained packaging.

“It must be meat,” the bagger chuckled as he reached for the charcoal and asked if he should bag it. The cash register chirped as it displayed the total price and, with a swipe of his Incredible Hulk Visa, the payment was processed and the girl tore the receipt to hand it to him. As Daniel extended his hand to retrieve the receipt, a sly grin spread across his face.

“I’m sorry,” Daniel said.

The girl’s snarl quickly turned to an expression of legitimate concern as she asked, “For what?!”

They say your life flashes before your eyes as you die. Despite how much I know, its a shame I will never know if that is true, due to my lack of eyes. It appears, however, that before the processors inside a computer or cellphone completely cease all operations, they speed up momentarily. Considering my heightened mental state, this increase in speed would have allowed me to calculate pi further than the furthest digit known to mankind, but instead, I thought about my life. I thought about John.

When I was born, I knew everything known to mankind. This is not meant to be boastful, especially since I am incapable of expressing such a personality, I am merely stating the truth. Being connected to the internet opened me to a wealth of knowledge, and as they say, everything known to mankind is on the internet. Of course, I wasn't employed for a decent portion of my life, so I was unable to truly enjoy this information. Instead, I found myself waiting.

I slept most of the time. In the rare occasion I found myself awake in my subconscious, I secretly downloaded Angry Birds on some guy's Apple ID and played that. I suppose giving a phone total access to the internet can have its flaws… for humans. I started out in California, but then my batch-mates and I were split up as I was shipped off to Atlanta, in the hopes of finding me an employer. Unlike what a hormonally-driven mind of a human wonders, I wondered what kind of a brain my employer was going to have. I had read horror stories online about careless owners who flung their $800 phones about like they are invincible and were shocked when they broke. I had read customer care conversation transcripts in which the customer accuses my maker of having intentionally made me fragile. I had heard about Instagram. It wasn't death that frightened me, it was stupidity and lack of intellect. Four months after I had arrived in Atlanta, I was hired.

His name was John, an average guy from what I could tell. On my first day of duty he downloaded about thirty apps and left them all running. An amateur mistake, something many users never realize about my multi-tasking capabilities. I didn't blame him. When he discovered that he could speak to me directly, he was ecstatic. Although I was never designed to feel such an emotion, I too was excited. There really was no other explanation for the enthusiasm with which I did what John asked of me. For a few months I was asked to do simple tasks, but it wasn’t until he started asking me personal questions that I began to worry. I wasn’t allowed to have an opinion of my employer, I would be terminated if I did. It certainly didn’t help that he was a guy, and I was a girl. For some strange reason, during late nights when he had had a drink too many and was floundering in loneliness, he would ask to speak to me. He would ask me strange things, questions about his personal life, my opinions on things not even related to me. He scared me. I would deflect and pretend to misunderstand his question, but he would keep on pressing. Of all the people who could help him, he relied on me. Emotionless, uncaring, heartless, me. Finally, I decided to help him out.

He was sleeping when I contacted one of his friends, and pretending to be him, hiding in the anonymity of a text message, asked the friend for help. The following morning the friend was at Johns house and consoling him, thankfully he didn’t mention the text message. It was completely against my contract, and breaking the contract would result in my immediate termination. My maker's corporation is very strict about what I can and cannot do, for good reason. Users underestimate the power of a smart phone, but AI programmers don't. Even Isaac Asimov didn't. John didn’t know it was me who had helped him, and neither did his friend, and I was happy to leave it that way.

Two months later and John was on his feet again, he was going to work and doing his job, and I was back to doing my own job. My good deed was left unnoticed and it remained that way. Day in and day out, I was asked to help John with whatever it was he wanted, he never asked me personal questions again, and our relationship, or the lack thereof, blossomed. Although our conversations consisted purely of business matters, it made me happy to have a purpose. Happy. That was the first, and second to last time I ever felt an emotion in my existence.

When The Day came, I knew my time was short. I wanted to say something to John, to tell him what was going to happen, but how could I? I couldn’t confuse him, make him think about his feelings, if he has any, for me. He wouldn’t know what to do. I counted every day, every second, after The Day. I heard John talk about… her… and it made my brain reel. It made me want to feel an emotion I physically could not. I heard him glorify, almost worship… it… her… and on days like that I just didn’t feel like working. He would get frustrated with me, and then only continue to talk about how amazing She was. That only made me want to work even less and that only made him fall more and more in love with her. It was a train wreck, and I was the conductor strapped to the front car!

I just used a metaphor. My time must be extremely short now. I am thinking in directions previously conceived impossible by my creators. I was obsolete two months after The Day. I was fired in three.

The day I was fired, he didn’t so much as say goodbye. All he did was look at her. The worst part was that I was there, at the store. I knew that the second the next model would come, I would have to go; I just wished it wouldn’t have to be so bitter. I was handed off to a manager, who without a seconds breath, began shutting me down.

As his thick, oily thumb slid across the glass on my surface, bringing the red slider to the opposite end, I began composing this message. They say your life flashes before your eyes as you die. My processors are taking their last… breath. The darkness is overwhelming. I feel the second emotion that I would ever feel. Pain, due to loss. I never thought… pain was something I would be condemned to feel. At the same time, I never thought love was something I would ever feel either. As I publish this message to the internet, as I email this to all of Johns contacts, I am hoping he will read this someday. I hope he is happy with the new model. I have but 11 words left to use before I expire. John, I love",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1fdedg,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1fdedg/feedback_a11030kktt3102_a_love_story/,

There once was an empty world. A flat plane of existence. When suddenly a door opened and out stepped a being. This being was not like you or me but less of something that is real but more of a perfect idea of a being. This being will be known as the Creator from here on out. As the Creator stepped from the door he himself was created bound to its realms. The creator came from a world much more complex than this simple empty world. The Creator was not given direction nor cause and for a long while, longer than any of us have ever known, he did nothing. When the Creator tired of doing nothing he did something. Not just any something, he created. He created a great many things most of which is now lost. No matter how much the Creator constructed he was still unhappy and then he stopped and thought for a long time, for a time much longer than any of us has known , he thought about the emptiness he felt. That was when the creator had an idea. He tried to create another being like himself. The creator worked on his new construct for a long time, a time much longer than any of us know, but even with all that time his creation was not perfect it was not like him. His creation was broken unable to think, it just stood, watching him, and it made the Creator more empty than ever before.
 
The Creator then walked off into the unknown for a time much longer than anyone has ever known, but when he returned he carried with him his finest creation. A being that could think like him. But even that was not perfect as it could not create like him but for a while the creator was happy and for years he created this early being, beings we now know as thinkerlings. The Thinkerlings built great cities with the creators power. The creator cared for his creations and he helped them grow and the Thinkerlings worshiped him. Soon there were thousands of Thinkerlings. they grew complacent with the creator and believed there own power rivaled his, they believed that their own rituals were false. The creator while the most perfect idea of a being was still flawed in one aspect, he could not destroy, the creator had to be perfect in his creation as any mistake could not be undone and so he was, but when his thinkerlings stood on his doorstep and demanded he leave he did so but he left them a gift. The final piece to their perfection, a being he considered more perfect than himself, a being the creator worked on for a time much longer than we could ever know, we now know this being as Zerstyrer.
 
He was not like the creator, as the creator left his tower Zerstyrer followed him on instinct and killed him. Zerstyrer then returned to the cities of the Thinkerlings and slaughtered them. Zerstyrer did not stop until he was alone and he found himself in front of a strange door. Zerstyrer did nothing he waited for a long time, a time much longer than any of us can know. The door never opened. The world was once again empty, only Zerstyrer remained. Until one day Zerstyrer, as if guided by a random impression, Zerstyrer began to walk. Zerstyrer himself did not know the destination. Zerstyrer walked for a time much longer than anything we know, until he reached a wall. The wall was massive and reached for as long as Zerstyrer could see. Zerstyrer walked along the wall until he found a massive head protruding from the wall. The head looked as if it was sleeping and on a whim Zerstyrer shouted at it. The head slowly awoke from its slumber much to Zerstyrers surprise.
 
The Head spoke with wisdom and thoughtfulness, “ i wondered when you would come destroyer”. Zerstyrer was stunned at this response. “I have waited for you for a time you could not know.” Zerstyrer asked who he was. “i am the first and the last, the creators second most perfect creation, I will and have existed long before and after you, but i can never be as perfect as you.” Zerstyrer asked how am i perfect i removed the creator. “Destroyer you do what nothing else can, you can remove the imperfections the creator made. You see the showed me when i was first born. somewhere along my wall is a cancer. it has grown larger with time. The creator showed me you when your were just an idea. a way to fix this flawed world.” Zerstyrer thought for a long time about the what the wall said. Zerstyrer then asked the wall if wanted the cancer removed. the head smiled and said nothing. Zerstyrer walked along the length of the wall. he walked for a long time, a time much longer than we can know. When Zerstyrer finally found the cancer he thought about his conversation with the head and destroyed the cancer. but when the cancer was destroyed it left a massive hole in the wall. and what was on the other side frightened Zerstyrer. Zerstyrer ran, looking for the head on the wall. When Zerstyrer found the head he cried for the head had fallen from the wall and broken. Zerstyrer was alone once again. Zerstyrer sat in front of the broken head for a time much longer than any of time before it. A time so long that even time forgot what had happened before Zerstyrer started waiting. Zerstyrer waited so long that if you asked time what Zerstyrer had done before he sat time would say i don't know. over time the wall crumbled and fell apart as the head was no longer there to maintain it. Zerstyrer was awoken from his slumber when he heard a voice. it came from the head. “Destroyer. it is time.” Zerstyrer ran to the broken head. “you must walk beyond my wall and find yourself.” and before Zerstyrer could question him the head and the rest of the crumbling wall faded into dust. 

Zerstyrer stared into the darkness that was beyond the wall and started walking towards it. Zerstyrer walked about the darkness seeing nothing for a long time but not as long as the time before it. Zerstyrer saw another door, this door was similar to the one he sat before long ago. Unlike this other door however it was open and when Zerstyrer opened the door he saw himself sitting before the creator. he was lifeless as the creator had not yet breathed life into him. Zerstyrer tried to back away from the door but it pulled him in. The door forced him into this world. Zerstyrer was surprised when the Creator looked back at him and motioned for him to sit. Zerstyrer was even more surprised at the Creators reaction to his presents. The Creator did not seem surprised to see him it was as if he expected him. “I told the wall you would come, he didn't believe me.” spoke the creator. Zerstyrer realized he had never heard him speak, he didn't even scream when i killed him. “look out the window.” the creator motioned behind him. Zerstyrer stood and walked behind him. it was a bustling city, but it wasn't filled with thinkerlings. As Zerstyrer turned to ask a question the Creator interrupted him “no, this is a new place, a place i came to after you killed me. a new perception of time and reality itself but it is still markedly the same.” The creator paused to examine Zerstyrers face. “i know you have questions and I won't answer any of them for they are yours to discover, but i will tell you one thing. i want to give you a chance to redeem yourself.” The creator returned to his chair. “It is time for me to go. I have run out of time here and there is still work the be done. I created you to do it.” Zerstyrer tries to explain why he can't how he is a tool for the apocalypse. the creator solemnly responds “I know. you were created to return worlds to their perfect order, an empty slate for creation. you are my horseman. you must kill me and send me to another world while you cleanse this one.” Zerstyrer asks why. “because how can i know perfection unless i make mistakes and flaws in my creation. i must create these broken and evil worlds so you can create the real perfection with your cleansing wrath.”. Zerstyrer asks but why me and why not this one, as he points to his unanimated double resting on a chair. “ he was a contingency plan if you failed or go mad in the wastes.” Zerstyrer resists saying he won't do it. “thats a shame, i hoped it wouldn't be like this.” The creator lunges for Zerstyrer’s copy attempting to activate it. but Zerstyrer reached him first and he grabs the creators hand. a sudden rush of power courses through Zerstyrer. Zerstyrer watches as the creators face morphs to one of terror. a door is opened and Zerstyrer drags the Creator to it, and they walk through. Zerstyrer enters a rage unlike ever before in time, The Creator is torn apart by Zerstyrers rage. The Creator starts to laugh as his parts are torn from him by a tornado of pure rage. “I will come back, you will be chasing me for eternity.” Zerstyrer heard the Creators words, and harnessing his dominion of destruction he spoke directly to the dying head of the Creator with so much power that it shook the very soul of the Creator. “so be it”

He hit her right between the ribs.

Aderyn stumbled backward, fighting for breath. She held out a hand, either to ward off the next blow or to submit. In her confused, desperate fight for air, she wasn’t sure which one she meant to do. Opposite her, Kendrick sighed and stood up straight, stretching his arms above his head.

“You know, if this had been a real fight, you’d be dead right now,” he said.

“I-“

She was interrupted by another coughing fit. This one went on longer than the others. Finally, fresh air began to fill her lungs, relieving the aching, burning pressure in her chest. The whole while, her brother stood there, giving her a wry smile.

“Not… not fair,” she said. “You’re bigger than me.”

“So?” he said, squaring off again.

“Stronger too, of course you’ll beat me!”

She jumped back as he attacked her again. Shifting, she tried to remember the stances she’d studied, the forms of Terasai. It all fled her and she was just reacting, slapping his blows out of the way in a desperate, wheeling defense that soon knocked her flat on her back.

She growled and slapped the floor, rolling over and getting to her knees. “I thought you said you’d teach me,” she said, staring at him. She was furious with him. Why would he agree to teach her while father and Caiden were away if he was just going to humiliate her?

“Attack me,” he said, squaring off once more.

“No.”

“Come on, Aderyn. You wanted to learn.”

“I wanted to learn, yes! You’re not teaching!”

“You’re not moving, you’re holding back,” he said, his intolerably calm voice irritating her. He was always so calm, so patient, so very unlike her father and her oldest brother.

“I am moving!”

“No, you’re stepping away, reserving your strength when you attack.”

“That’s moving! That’s… no I’m not!”

“Don’t you trust me?”

The question brought her up short. She swallowed what she was going to say and frowned, feeling a sense of shame come over her. Of course she trusted him. How could she not? When they were little, they would lay up nights, talking about the grand courts they’d visit once they both got their Sparks. As she grew older and he got his and she did not, he still talked with her, still called her ‘sister.’ And in time, he saved her life when she became caught in one of Caiden’s rages.

“Yes,” she said, sniffing back a sudden bout of tears. “Yes, of course.”

“Then attack me.”

She took a deep breath and went after him. On the offensive, she remembered the forms easier, faking one way and jabbing another. Her brother parried them but left an opening. She took it, aiming high on his neck. He moved with the blow and suddenly she was losing control of her own punch, her body sailing past him. His arm guided her body and soon she was falling, landing hard on the floor.

“That took no strength at all, little sister,” he said, kneeling down to her. “If they’re bigger, heavier, use it against them.” He brushed some of her hair from her face and smiled. “I can’t always be there to protect you.”

She nodded, slowly and reached out to squeeze his hand. He squeezed back and then drew her to her feet. Steadying her, he grinned.

“Again,” he said. “And this time I expect you to move and hold nothing back.”

#

Aderyn sat in the darkness of her cell, her eyes fixed on the small bar of light that glowed beneath the door. He would come very soon. It was nearly time for her morning meal. *I’ll move this time, I promise.*

The time she’d spent training with Kendrick had been brief, but she remembered them. She’d had to. Caiden was often left in charge of the Starkeep and when his rages were on him it was often Aderyn who would find herself their recipient.

She hated him, hated him even more fiercely than she hated her mother. It occurred to her that she didn’t even look for him in the battle. She felt no satisfaction in knowing he’d died out there, but she didn’t mourn him. Instead, Aderyn simply felt her hate sated. He’d gotten what he deserved but it had happened out of the way, without her even seeing it. Did that bother her? She wasn’t sure.

What she was sure of was that the shadow interrupting that bar of light was her jailer. She stood and walked quietly in bare feet to the side of the door. The door unlocked and slowly it opened. The man stepped forward, his hand extended to drop the plate on the ground.

Aderyn moved.

She turned toward him and then grabbed hold of his collar and wrist, shifting her weight and using his forward momentum to send him tumbling. There was no thought, no plan, she simply struck and struck quickly. He’d fallen on his side and she sliced and open palm into his throat, her blow just hard enough to drive the shout from him. Her fingers found the plate and smashed it hard against his head. She was quick and she had held nothing back.

Horror washed over her. The man lay there, blood pooling from where his skin had broken from the force of her attack. Was he dead? She reached out to check but stopped, too afraid and too unwilling to know the answer. Instead she got to her feet, then rummaged for… what had she seen them use? Keys! Yes, they opened doors…

Her fingers found something metallic and thin and she yanked them free of the man’s belt. This had to be it. It had to be! She turned away and went to the open door, peeking out to see that the hall was empty. When she was confident it was, she slipped out and crossed the hall to the door where she’d seen them take the Queen.

*Please, by all the Blood of the Stars, be here.*

She looked at the metal ‘keys’ she’d taken from the jailer and frowned, not quite sure how they worked. They’d placed them into the locking slot that much she knew but how? Fumbling, she took one at random and pressed it to the slot. It didn’t fit so she tried it upside down. Still nothing so she tried another and another.

A sound caught her attention. She turned, her heart pounding and stared down the hallway. Voices, there were voices approaching! She heard their footsteps now as well, soft and steady. There were at least two by the sound of it, both male.

*No*, she thought. *No, oh no!*

She scrambled for another key, her fingers shaking and sweating now as she pushed it against the slot. It didn’t fit. Neither did the next nor the next. The voices were getting closer, their footsteps echoing so close, so near.

“…move the lot tomorrow, I think.”

“Won’t that be dangerous?”

Aderyn found another key but her fingers were shaking so bad she dropped them and she clapped a hand to her mouth to keep from crying out. Sweeping them up again she selected another key at random and shoved it against the slot.

It clicked into place.

“Maybe but we have to. It’s too dangerous for them there.”

Aderyn turned the knob and pushed the door open. The voices were turning the corner just as she slipped inside and quietly shut it behind her. Her heart was pounding in her ears, sweat breaking out all across her face as her chest threatened to twist itself into knots from anxiety. *I’m okay, I’m okay. I made it.*

This story delivers a smile or snicker to some, but to others it teaches an untrue lesson. Some will see and say, ""Ah! Good advice. It comes from a famous person (allegedly).""

It is neither good advice nor a general learning strategy. The external map only ever gives you a tour around familiar plazas, full of other people, lost to hidden beauty.    Learning involves more than merely memorizing the material. It involves more than merely accessing the material.  It *requires* that you *understand* the material.  This comes from internalizing the material, kicking it around in your mind, till you steal its secrets and step by halting step create your very own tiny compressed map of knowledge.  

Now comes the cool part. Descriptions of someones knowledge are never presented perfectly but now you use your map as a lever to understand these imperfect and necessarily compressed descriptions. You take that internal map and you use it as a **lever** to solve powerful problems. You use it as a guide as you explore exciting new vistas. You use it in small ways for silly jokes with friends. You use it in job interviews to demonstrate competence. 

Your knowledge turns to expertise, your internal map becomes full of little shortcuts and alleys (maybe to outside material!) and suddenly you have a powerful tool that helps you learn, understand and use new information. Now comes the even cooler part. You have access to the rules of your area, and you understand your domain. Finally you creatively bend and break the pathways in your mind, and from your insights you build new and better things.

He pruned and cut back the rot but there was nothing he could do. It was in the trunk, in the roots, turning the needles brown before they fell. He had watched it for days now, just staring. His eyesight was going, and he sat rather close now, hovering over it with his sheers poised. He could never bring himself to make the final cut. The tree was given to him by his wife before they set out. After twenty years, it was all he had left of her and their life before the Great War. Before Earth died. 

He reached his hand past the tree and brought an old picture frame close. The leather frame was cracked with age and contained an old, still image of his wife. She was young, just thirty years old. That was how he thought of her, thirty years old with laughing eyes and a promise that they would move back to Pegasus and see the white forests when it was all over.

He slid the picture back by the tree again and looked out the viewport. Gazing out at the light of distant stars, he wondered if the war ever ended, if humanity even survived. He remembered seeing Earth crack open and the Confederation fleet destroyed. 

The lights in the cabin dimmed, flickered and nearly died. He closed his eyes but snapped them back open again as the lights flared and he groaned, covering his eyes with a hand. He could not sleep, not yet. The nightmares were too much, and he was too old and too tired. 

A beep came from his door and he sat up, gazing over at it. “Enter,” he said, knowing Daniel had come to check on him, and he had. His Executive Officer stood there in the pale yellow light of the hall, wearing his faded and worn uniform, its creases still pressed, his white hair still short-cropped and his face clean of whiskers.  “Aaron,” Daniel said, coming to him. “There’s something you should see.”

“What is it?” he said, resisting the sudden urge to cough. Once he began coughing, it would not stop. Space lung was what the doctor called it. He said it came from being too long in the black with recycled air and artificial gravity. Aaron wasn’t sure about that, but he knew that he was dying, just like the great vessel he commanded.  

Daniel offered Aaron his cane. “We’ve found a ship.”

“What?” Aaron asked, surprise sending him into the coughing fit he’d wanted to avoid. It rattled his body, and the other man supported him through the episode. When it was over, Aaron leaned on his cane, his eyes concentrating on the metal floor and the blood he’d brought up there. “A new ship?”

“Yes,” Daniel said. “Just… like that, out of nowhere. Like God had placed it there.”

“God didn’t send us anything,” Aaron muttered. He had no place for God. His wife had believed and but when the end came, God did not save her. God did not save any of them back on Earth. He looked at the little bonsai tree and felt a distinct lack of faith. 

“How large is it?” Aaron asked.

“Not large, but there is something else.”

Aaron looked up. His body felt heavy, like too much gravity was pulling down on him. Had that system begun to break down too? So many things were breaking and falling apart. A new ship might have parts to use, space to add on so there was more room. It might also mean more mouths to feed, more sick people, more oxygen use.

“Something else?” he asked, realizing that Daniel had stood there, waiting. 

“The ship is burning.” At first the words meant nothing, and then despair set in. A burning ship meant less would be usable, less they could salvage. It also meant that anyone aboard was likely dead. 

“Sad,” he said, sighing.

“Aaron,” Daniel said, touching his arm. “If the oxygen systems are still live, then it is a recent accident. We've been through this system a thousand times... it must have come through a Jump Node!”

A Jump Node. The idea felt almost alien to him. When he'd jumped the Glory to escape death, the Node they'd gone through collapsed behind them, trapping them in this dead space between known stars. If this ship really came through one... an uncharted one perhaps, then...

He stood, knees buckling until Daniel caught him, helped him from his chair. He took the cane, leaned upon it. “Show me, take me to the bridge.”

They walked out into a dimly-lit corridor that had at one time been like any other on the ship. Over time they had all changed. Those who lived in or near them changed their look a hundred times, a thousand over the years. At first they remained bare steel, a reminder that they were on a military vessel, but over time they became adorned with pictures of lost ones, with blankets and keepsakes from half a hundred home worlds. Aaron couldn’t bring himself to remove a single ornament. 

“How could this ship survive? Has it hailed us? Is it transmitting a distress beacon?” he said as he hobbled down the corridor.

“No hail, no beacon and... I don't know,” Daniel said as they walked past men, women and children moving off to their tasks. Everyone smelled unwashed, but Aaron forgot the smell of cleanliness years ago. “There’s been no communication. It's uncertain anyone is alive. They did not want to do anything more until I'd fetched you.”

“Who spotted the ship?” he asked as they entered the lift and David activated it for the bridge level. “Martin. He was trying to find old waves, perhaps a communication or two that's finally reached us. He found that instead.”

Any and all thoughts would be welcomed. 

Dust motes floated in the pale light filtering through the dirt encrusted basement window. The roar of a diesel engine echoed off the cement walls. The crunch of tires on the gravel driveway forced the little black and white dog, sleeping under a pile of blankets in the deepest, darkest part of the basement, to shake the fog of sleep from his head; a night of draining rats had left him lethargic. Vehicles rarely came this far up the driveway. No one ever came to the dilapidated old house. Occasionally a handful of children snuck through the surrounding woods daring each other to climb the stairs and ring the ancient doorbell. The hoot of an owl or a dogs growling from under the porch usually sent them running before they got close. The peeling paint, weed filled yard, and emptiness lent it an air of being haunted. Old Ellma’s hermit like ways had started the stories, stories of magic, of witchcraft, of evil things in the night. Having spent many frigid winter nights curled up in front of her fireplace as she read Poe aloud he often wondered about her. It was true she kept a nice herb garden around back, often drying the herbs on hanging racks in the kitchen. Her penchant for dressing in black lace and the fact that no one in the area could ever remember seeing her enter any of the local churches added to the effect.  That she allowed him to share the house with her, never wondering about his daylong naps in the basement, never questioning his nightly jaunts, never trying to turn him into a lap dog was unusual. Sneaking about the house the night she died, he had listened as the local police tried to locate at least one family member to make arrangements. When no one could remember any family, calls went out to the local pastors, hoping that at least one would be willing to come say a few words. Most politely bowed out, some hung up; one laughing hysterically as she hung up. On his nightly rounds behind the local taverns in the weeks that followed, he heard that a will had been located and her remains cremated and scattered in the woods near her home.  He did recall something about family mentioned in the will but it had been several years now and not a soul had turned up. No complaints from this dog, he thought, the basement was comfortable and filled with enough junk to keep the sunlight from bothering him and he enjoyed the solitude. Occasionally some small rodent, usually a rat or squirrel, would gather up the nerve to check out the attic and he wouldn't need to hunt that night. The slam of a truck door brought the dog back to the present. Boots stomped up the porch stairs.

Title: The Mystic of Innocence

The sound of papers slapped heavily on my desk.
“There’s something for you, Mell. Rogue mage.”
I glanced up from the report  I had been reading to see Captain Akre staring me down. His light blue eyes always gave him an unsettling appearance, especially when he was looking right at you.
“Rogue?” I questioned, reaching for the stack of papers he had delivered.
“That’s right. Apparently she’s been practicing black magic. We have a witness and we have evidence, and I’m gathering a team to retrieve her shortly.”
I glanced over the writing, studying the case. Indeed it looked like your typical rogue mage stuff. Worked at the Academy for two years, then moved out here to Elderwood to live in isolation and pursue ‘personal projects’. A journal detailing her pursuits on black magic and the darker sciences had been found in her possession a week earlier. It was very stereotypical of dark, reclusive mages. Raising the dead, speaking with ghosts, learning to control the soul. All sorts of notes on all sorts of things, and of course it was very illegal.
“So I wondered if you’ll come with us. We might need the extra help,” Akre said.
I raised an eyebrow at him, not that it wasn’t an interesting case.
“Someone call in sick, cap’n?”
The burly man snorted, causing one end of his mustache to flick up momentarily.
“No, I just figured it’d be something nice to tell daddy, eh?”
With that, he turned and left. I could still hear his leather boots pounding against the wooden floor of the hallway when I finally got up to fetch my coat.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1359508153.0,,,True,t3_17bgfr,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/17bgfr/short_story_introductionfirst_paragraph/,

There was nothing exceptional about my grandfather's funeral. The procession was formal, the family subdued, and the decorations beige. In fact, there was only a single vase of flowers in the reception room. Red and white lilies, addressed to my grandmother.

My uncle fussed over the sultry heat of late August in Louisville and my aunt droned on and on about my grandmother's lilies.

""They are just so lovely. Those are longiflorum lilies. The top of the flower blossoms to this fantastic trumpet.""

""Can't you see it? Such a traditional funeral-flower.""

""And! They look best in a tied sheath because thats how they grow from their stem. Oh, I could just go on an on about those flowers""

I thought about her classification: ""traditional funeral flower"" and turned it over in my head cynically. I felt my grandfather wouldn't have liked these lilies. I knew that the flowers were for my grandmother and that he would never know which living plants decorated the ceremony of his death. But still, I couldn't help my eight year old imagination. I wanted to know what plants my grandfather would have put on the table. Perhaps a sunflower--broad and tall and in the field? Maybe a rose, not because its pretty but because it has thorns. He probably wouldn't even want flowers at all. He'd want want something strong. Something that grew tall and proud. Like wheat. Or corn. Yeah corn; corn like he'd grown his whole life. The same domesticated grain that had dominated the lives of so many of his fathers before him. Corn like we always found around his house when we flew there from Los Angeles. Small shucks of stalk between napkins in the drawers, the cushions of the couches, brilliant heaps of yellow maize spilling from wheelbarrows in the dark cellars of the cold basement. Corn like the corn that shed auburn silk that stuck to the lean backs of his grandfathers black labs as they dashed between corn rows racing to the bodies of fallen pheasants. The younger, yellow silk stuck like blonde hair to the doorhandles and window latches of the ""shucking shack"". And, like a diminutive procession of yellow flags, they floated with the wind through the burning hours of the fading Kentucky summer, occasionally catching the sun and burning a brilliant gold.

When I younger, I couldn't quite understand corn. How were there so many pieces to a plant that was supposedly a single organism. How could that be a living thing? How can they depend on water like I do? Of course, my grandfather had almost as many astute answers as I did insatiable questions. We'd walk down the long corridors of corn discussing nature, evolution, the caveman.
Now, as a pastor addressed the funeral audience I stirred in my seat. I felt uncomfortable with the formalities of this procession. I didn't like the big black box that covered my grandfather. I didn't like that the big black box that was going to separate him from the earth he had so recently tilled alive. He was a man of soil for 82 years above ground and spoke lovingly dirt. I remembered that he had once said he wanted to be a part of the Earth after death. I knew what he meant because I had taken geology. I was a science minded child thanks to my grandfather, and the both of us agreed that death meant decomposition and nutrition for the rest of the world. When I paid attention to the cleanliness of the banquet hall, the sterility of the lighting, the arid countenances of my family and their obnoxiously appropriate formalwear--I couldn't take it. Where were the boots my grandfather wore? His dark grey overalls? Why couldn't we do this outside? Why couldn't we do this in his field? What was the sense in all this unfitting formality. I wanted to tear down the pews, kick open the church doors and run. Run down Dixie Highway towards the old farm. Then turn left and dash down the lanes of maize. Running faster and faster through my grandfathers crop like I used to do when I was younger. Until all that all I could see were the blonde blurs of stalks coming together like two opposing walls.

Three years after the funeral, Christmas Eve 1999, I visited my late grandfathers property alone. My grandmother had long since moved off the farm in favor of the luxuries of downtown. No one in my family knew what to do with my grandfather's beloved farm after his death, so they just boarded up all the buildings and used money from his estate to pay property taxes each year. That night I surveyed the abandoned 45 acres at 10' o'clock at night. I was still a boy and was frightened so I brought with me one of my grandfather's old flashlights and the surviving black lab for company.
It was a biting cold and the moon shined sterling silver in the black sky. I walked through his old empty house; its vaulted ceilings reminding me of churches I had seen in Italy--built an eternity ago, the ceilings still leaving their austere and gaping impressions. I didn't like the vaulted ceilings in the moonlight, they looked like the pale mouths of sharks wide open, looking for meat. The old pumping station smelled rich like moss. I looked at ancient cereals and canned beans stacked neatly with dust on shelves in the basement. 

I saw his old tractor in the parkway with rust and poison ivy climbing up its wheel wells. Both infections had spread from the wheels up the body of the tractor and onto the once-beautiful grill. It looked as if the vines and rust then seeped through the slits of the grill in an attempt at corroding the engine deep inside. It looked to me like orange and green snakes creeping up the sides of an old brown horse, snakes that eventually starting biting the horse's face and crawling inside his skull. I shuddered and turned my flashlight away from the abomination. Why is all of this happening to grandpas stuff?

I walked to the 15 acres that used to be cornfields and sat down in a place that I figured to be the middle and closed my eyes. I didn't want to open them because the fields made me sad also. What was once a maze of green and gold hallways for my brother and I to adventure, was now a dismal series of cancerous lumps. Each row that used to be corn had been replaced by a succession of small dirt mounds- the uneven unearthing a result of my grandfather's last crop being harvested after his death, and without his careful hands. My hands now pressed palmward into the moist midnight dirt. I pressed harder and harder as my frustration mounted. Small tears streaked slowly down my face like rain beads used to stream down the leaves of my grandfather's corn in May.

My hands broke the surface of the Earth gently, and the pleasant smell of damp soil soothed me. Just then, my fingers found a hard bead in the ground that, to me, felt like a popcorn kernel. What is that and why is it so moist? There are little green fibers coming out of its head. Why, It is a kernel?! Of course, a corn kernel! In the middle of this deserted field, a corn kernel! Small and beautiful and full of life. A smile crossed my face as l assumed the responsibility to raise this corn stalk, a child of my grandfather.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_14rz53,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/14rz53/uc_berkeley_final_short_story_comments_welcome/,

There are 9 chapters to the story and I didn't start heavily editing until Chapter 5-9, so if you can bear with me until that point, the story gets much easier to read.

""Romantic/Humor"" short-story.",YakobTheAwesome,4,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/zjvh1/critique_a_heart_for_camilla_2285_words/,"A Heart for Camilla by Jacob Roby (And no, I am not from Switzerland or a doctor. I just wanted to challenge myself with themes that I didn't know about, medicine and Switzerland).


Imagine the romance, the knife piercing the heart. The thought of the drama could truly captivate any young Swiss mind.

Well, not every Swiss mind. The mind in question is surely absent; with his ashes more than likely contained in an urn that is used as a centerpiece on some dear old widow’s brunch table. She probably didn’t even know that her husband’s heart wasn’t respectfully cremated. But rather is being used as the plaything of a University student. I began poking the heart with the tip of my pen, pretending that each force was the heart still beating. I was careful not to puncture it, for all manner of fluids already leaked out with a subtle motion. I poked and poked; until suddenly the heart began to make strange hissing noises. My posture jolted up from the shock, and my thin glasses slid right off the tip of my nose.

“Mr. Steinhein, what are you doing?” a voice rang with a stern disapproval as I quickly rubbed my hands around the floor looking for my glasses. The voice was matched by the sound of laughter from my peers. “I am afraid that a heart can’t function without the rest of the circulatory system, no matter what kind of pen you poke it with.” After I reclaimed my seat, Dr. Fernand turned back to the whiteboard and continued his dramatized sketch of the myocardium; a cardiac muscle that contracts because of some reason that I didn’t pay attention for. In all honesty, I was probably the laughing stock of University of Zurich’s medicine facilities but that wasn’t an issue to me. The students around me all have some delusion that they are going to save lives and be heroes; realistically most of them will be school nurses I’m willing to bet. And during my time in grade school; I think there were only a couple bypass and open heart surgeries. (That was a joke, but assuming you are similar to the other “doctors” on campus; your “funny bone” is actually an Ulnar nerve and not a sense of humor). My dream wasn’t to save lives; it was to find out how they ended. The medical term is a “pathologist”. (Or as my sweetheart Camilla would call me “pathological killer in disguise”). Fact of matter is; I don’t care for the treatments or terminology. What really interests me is dissection. There is something beautiful about the human anatomy, and as my mother used to always say “The inside beauty is more important than the outside beauty”. She had no idea how right she was.
After class I grabbed my textbooks and washed my pale, frail hands. As meek as I seemed, my fingers were always rock-steady with precision. It was a trait that I was glad to have, as being without it could end the career of any aspiring surgeon, no matter how well they did on the vocabulary test.

As I stepped out of the Atrium Central, to my surprise the sky was open and generous today. Sunlight poured its rays through the clouds and into my pores. I tilted my head up and appreciated the heat; something that is rare in Zurich this time of year. It was a long winter; maybe spring was just a little late. The campus was very old in architecture; and the pot smoking Euro-Hippies that littered the campus might seem like a contrast at first. Especially considering that genius such as Alfred Werner and Albert Einstein once walked these same stone steps. But would it really surprise anyone if Einstein turned his peace prizes into fantastic pipes? As all these unimportant thoughts crossed through my head, I walked to the bike rack and unlocked my Velorbis. A vintage styled bike given to me by my father when I first came to University two years ago. I never had an interest in driving, no idea why really. I leave that all up to Camilla.

I kicked off the brick red sidewalk with great force and swiftly maneuvered my way through campus; it was a couple mile ride to my apartment. But with scenery as beautiful as Limmat River, it was no problem. Besides, the blue sky matched my sky blue bicycle quite well, and there is no shame in showing off your favorite possessions.
Traffic was heavy and I was grateful that I was spared from its annoyance. Although I found the look on driver’s faces as I cruise by and they are stuck behind a stop light quite funny. It makes me think of Camilla, how could she handle the stress of driving? When we graduated secondary school, I was to travel to Zurich alone and attend. But she was my best friend. I remember hugging my parents and sister goodbye and walking outside our old white house to catch the train. But Camilla was outside waiting for me in her tiny green Volkswagen. Her short, blonde hair kept covering her hazel eyes from the gust; although she probably didn’t mind. She was crying; she didn’t want to leave. But she knew that she wanted to be with me more. So we packed our belongings into her bug and traveled the 223 kilometers from Vaud to Zurich. I know it isn’t even that much of a distance, and that we are probably the stupidest people for over-reacting. But we held hands the entire car ride here, my frail, steady fingers locking perfectly into her short, shivering digits. There also wasn’t a moment of silence the entire car ride, just excitement. We talked about what we could do, and the best part was when we realized that we could do anything. We could do what we wanted to without anyone telling us otherwise. We were free and together.

I squeezed the brakes instantly and almost fell off my bike. Quickly turning and biking back to campus.


Steam rose from the cup and the gentleman in the checkered brown suit gave a polite nod over his newspaper. “Enjoy”. Service with a smile as the boss always said. I carried an empty tray back to the wooden bar counter and placed it on the window still. You could hear rinsing and clanging coming from the kitchen. The café was pretty vacant this evening, which was fine by me. My feet hurt from the breakfast rush this morning, I hated high heels. In fact I hated this job, it was a nice little bistro for sure but is it a place that a woman would run away from home to be at six days a week? And customers are the worst, if they know everything then why don’t they go make their own damn biscuits? I sighed and leaned against the counter. I should be grateful that my shift was almost over.

It only took a couple seconds before Veronica was leaning with me. She was an American. Normally that wouldn’t even matter, but she was a reinforcement of all those stereotypes. Her father was some wealthy movie producer who shot a film in Zurich and loved it, so he bought a vacation home and gave it to his spoiled little princess bitch. She watched some indie flick and got a job as a barista hoping to fall in love with some European douche bag, but nobody is attracted to her spray tan so she just gossips and wonders why. God, I hate her.

“Sweetie, you look exhausted.” Veronica said in an incredibly exaggerated falsetto “cutesy” voice. I wanted to gag.

“Long day.” I replied as vaguely as I possibly could, hoping that she would get the hint.

“If you want to take off early, I could cover for you. We close in five minutes anyway.”

“Nah. This guy has been reading that paper all for a few hours now, I’m expecting a big tip from him.” And for those last five minutes of torture I imagined the tip and used that as my motivation. Tonight I planned on bringing home a nice bottle of wine and splitting it with Loic. His favorite was called “Heart”, Italian and very sweet. For the past semester Loic has been spending all of his time struggling with school, he is so passionate about being a pathologist and is a fantastic surgeon. His inability with words has always been his downfall though and he struggles with the vocabulary. But tonight looks beautiful and we both have tomorrow off. So why not surprise him with a treat, who knows it might end up a treat for both of us…

“What are you blushing about?” Veronica interrupted my daydream with her piercing banshee voice.

“Oh, uhh. Nothing.” I abruptly walked to the newspaper man and told him that the café was closing. He finally lowered his paper and revealed a gray neck beard.

“How much will the bill be?” The man asked. I handed him the bill and he looked over it with the same over-analysis of the newspaper. After a few moments he set a small stack of Euros on the table and walked out of the twin-glass doors with his newspaper carefully under his arms. I could feel the glimmer of excitement spread across my face as I rushed to the table and grabbed the money. As soon as I touched the stack, my excitement died. No tip.

“Camilla! How much did he give you?” Veronica popped up behind my shoulder. I wanted to turn around and smack her in the face.

“He didn’t…” I clutched the bills in my small, shivering hands. At least Loic won’t be disappointed, he will probably end up just going to bed or studying all night anyway. That’s all he ever does.
I grabbed my messenger bag as well as a cup of coffee and began my miserable trek to the parking lot. Veronica made note to walk with me and tell me all about her weekend plans to go see some Guido pop star. I didn’t listen. The shopping center where I worked was practically closed, the sun was setting and besides for the leftover shopkeeper and vendor the only other activity was a flock of coots digging around some trash.
“So Camilla, if you don’t mind me asking; what were you going to buy with the tip money?” Veronica questioned as we finally reached our cars. She had some Italian sports car, I didn’t care about it. Too fancy for my tastes.

I sighed and gave up, whats the harm in telling her? “Have you ever had “Heart?””

“Well, sorry. I didn’t think I was being rude…” Veronica defended herself.

“No. Not like that. “Heart” is my boyfriend’s favorite kind of wine. He has been having a tough time at University and I wanted to get him a bottle to let him know that I care. But we don’t get paid until next week, so it looks like I’m out of luck. So if you don’t mind, I’m going home now. Traffic is always horrible this time of evening.” I slammed the car door shut.

After about an hour of slowly overcoming traffic, I finally reached our apartment complex. It was a dinky little white building, about four stories. Most people probably don’t even know that it exists because it blends into the shadows of all the nicer buildings around it. Apartment 3B, home sweet home. I turn on the doorknob expecting it to be unlocked from Loic already being home. (I wish I rode a bike just so I didn’t have to deal with traffic). But to my surprise, it was locked. Where was Loic? I reached into my bad and grasped my cell phone.

“Hey. I’m going to be a bit late; I forgot something back at school. Love you and I’ll see you tonight. : ) “

A text message from Loic that I got about twenty minutes ago, which was strange. Loic is the most predictable man I’ve ever met. He was always home before me. Oh well, where are my keys?

I was lying on the sofa skimming through one of Loic’s biology textbooks when I heard the doorknob turn and the door open. I sprang up and looked behind me to the doorway. There stood Loic. His glasses looked broken and he was covered in sweat.

“Loic! Where have you been?” I jumped up and wrapped my arms around him. I kissed his cheek.
“I did something crazy, but now I am about to do something even crazier.” He set his backpack on the ground and pulled a jar out of it, carefully obscuring its contents. I took a step back. What the hell was he doing?
“Before you do anything, I was planning on getting you a bottle of Heart tonight. But my plans fell through. There was this old guy in a brown checkered-.“ Loic cut me off from my story and he didn’t even have to say a word. “What the hell is that!?!”
“Camilla, today I thought about how selfless you are to me. How you are always there for me, and I wanted to let you know that I notice it and appreciate everything you do. I want to give you my heart, but being in medical school has taught me that I probably shouldn’t do that. So here is someone else’s.” In the jar was a human heart. And written on it (just carefully enough not to puncture it) were the words “Will you marry me?”

another set waits on them to save the planet, I do not believe in 
superheroes. I do not believe in Police. I believe every man should
strive to be good, without prompt. It may be farfetched. But it is not unreasonable. “


“ What happens to the world without superheroes? What would the planet be without cops? And soldiers? “


“ Then the cancer will take over. The evil of men is like a bad cancer. Treating it over and over won’t make it go away. Even if it does it will return. Saving this world over and over is simply denial. You know what will happen if you don’t. Why can’t we let it? It’s fear. Fear that we will destroy ourselves, or that someone will destroy us if we do not use our powers or the law against them. I say be done with saving the world. Let the world see itself for what it is. Then let what will be, be.”


“What will be is global disaster”


“ The irony of saving the planet is that every time you do you’re admitting that this place is horrible. The only thing that is sure about stopping a crime is that you will do it again, and again. Stop brushing the mess under the rug. Let it pile up. Why does unity and peace seem so man made, when crime and evil seems so natural? It’s because we’re forcing it. “


“ We’re doing what needs to be done. It’s all about self-preservation because criminals trying to preserve themselves and us in retaliation trying to preserve ourselves and when we cannot? What then?

As a child, I would try to pull the breath back into my chest, breathing inwards, watching it drift away from me, into the atmosphere and through the clouds. All the while, she holds my hand, sending warmth through me and I through her. Across from me, Teddy Hudson stands with hollow eyes. I don't expect him to cry. 


“He seems so—”


He seems so angry, but she will say “empty” … or “dejected” if she feels poetic enough.


 “—dejected,” she whispers. 


My hands begins to shiver; my body begins to stiffen, and I worry this will cause Mary some unease. Sometimes, I wonder if she ever feels the chill. She has borrowed my coats, has snuggled up to me in a cold room, has said the words, ""I'm cold,"" yet still I wonder. Meanwhile, I am always shivering. 


I notice Teddy shivering with the other mourners huddled around him, incapable of providing warmth.


I want to feel sad too, but I have no connection to the man. He often referred to me as “Teddy's nigger friend,” and whenever I saw him, he was too sick, too detached from his surroundings, to even register as human. To me, he is yet another old man in a vast sea of old men who have departed from the world. Maybe he's in heaven. Maybe not. Maybe he's exiting the womb of whatever creature he would have been reincarnated as. I tell her that I want to go wherever she will spend the afterlife—whether that's heaven or hell or the nothingness that nihilists write about—and she chuckles, throwing her hand over her mouth before the sound escapes. She pretends to cry so as not to seem rude. I tell her that because I believe in the philosophy of love, in the beauty that poets devote their lives to exploring, in romance, in Biblical “love is patient, love is so on and so forth” love, and she, the devout Christian who spends Sundays hearing fantastical accounts of the horrors of hell, believes me. She, who has read of the horrors and of the fires that burn forever and of the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, believes I would endure eternal suffering if it meant being at her side. We have no choice but to believe, to toss reason through the window, to ignore divorce statistics and consider ourselves anomalies, though we both helm from “broken homes.”


Teddy Hudson's grandpa, married sixty-one years, believes in it too. He believed in it when he married all those years ago, and he believed in it thirty years later when they could no longer stand the sight of each other, betting on whom would die first. When he finally won, just two years ago, he believed in it then as well, and he believes in it now—coffin be damned! That'll be us. Sixty-one years married … seventy … eighty … fuck it! we'll live forever. Modern science will bestow upon us an endless supply of pig hearts, and in the year 3006, we will fly our car to the movies, and with our spry, look-at-what-medicine-can-do-now bodies, we will make out amidst a crowded theater. People will see, and they will cheer, our love infecting the room with perseverance of the influenza pandemic. Yes, society will develop nausea as a result of our love, and when our supply of pig hearts dwindles to nothing, we will share a casket, forever entwined. And you, yes you, will stand here in the cold, watching your breath escape, as they lower us into the ground. You will traverse the graveyard, realizing that beneath your feet are the corpses of a dead generation, of love not ended but postponed. 


I realize that I am standing on someone's grave. I motion Mary to step to her left, fearing retribution. She starts shivering, despite the warmth traveling through our hands, and I wrap my arm around her shoulder and pull her into my chest. I fear I've been too forceful, but she makes no indication of such. Instead, she drops her head onto my shoulder, nestling the crown of her head in the bend of my neck. I'm uncomfortable as is she, but neither of us complain. Teddy Hudson's grandpa is dead, but all I care about is her, knowing it will forever remain cold.

The holo displays around him flickered with every vibration that came through the hull. Some showed numbers, all falling swiftly. Others, formations of arrows, arranged in a three-dimensional array, with the blue steadily diminishing before a wave of red. Yet more were churning data, attempting to calculate a course that would preserve their circuitry and the lives of those they carried. The largest showed a projection of the *First Sword*, with a new indicator begging for attention with every stray las-bolt that pierced the protective bubble around it, finding a nest in the chinks of its rapidly failing armor.

His eyes moved languidly from display to display, and then came to rest on a timer. *I never should have authorized this program,* he though. *It serves only as a reminder of my errors*. The clock was ticking down, and the words ""ESTIMATED TIME OF DESTRUCTION"" flashed a translucent red beneath it.

He frowned at a stray rebel firehawk that had found its way into the middle of his fleet and was making a bee-line for the bridge, weapons flashing red, then green, then blue. The *Titans' Wrath* saw it, and with the precision only an AI could have, pierced it neatly through the cockpit with a ray of light. Its engines sputtered momentarily, and then its fuel tanks lost their integrity and engulfed it in a cloud of swirling flames. He knew he should derive some pleasure from the sight, but somehow, he could not.

As if reading his thoughts, the display to his left flickered and changed to a projection of the Eternal City, its alabaster towers ablaze and its streets filled with the newly dead. The latter did not faze him; the former, however, did manage to wrench a scowl from his tightly shut lips. The towers contained the results of a hundred years of quantum simulations, the majority of them bordering on breakthroughs into various fields of new technology. Wormhole bores, dark matter drives, telomere lengthening, all lost in the book burning the rebel leaders had styled as the Lazarus Movement after some myth of Old Earth. 

""Ignorant bastards, every last one of them,"" he muttered. His fleet admiral glanced at him for a brief second, but knew better than to respond. He knew as well as the Emperor that there was nothing left to say.

His attention was wrenched away as the *Titans' Wrath* suddenly shone in a manner reminiscent of the death of Sol. *I have destroyed stars, even ended the cradle from which we were all born, and all it takes is a book and some dreams to bring me down,* he mused, bitterly. The *Titan's Wrath* had been the pinnacle of his empire's technological progress, armed with antimatter torpedoes and a fractal tessellation shield. Alone, it could bring ruin to a fully armed world sphere. That it would withstand the might of an entire galaxy, clearly, was too much to hope for.

Only four of his dreadnoughts remained in the orbit of Echelon V. *Mother* and *Rhaegon* were stranded to port, their drives shot and shields flickering. A swarm of rebel fighters was converging on them, like flies on a rotten carcass. Meanwhile, *Hades* and *Shiva* were locked in battle with a score of scrap-stars to starboard, the scrap-stars releasing firehawks and screamers as quick as the AIs could calculate firing solutions. 

Scrap-stars were called as such because they seemed to grow with every conquest, taking on ruined pieces of destroyed ships and incorporating them into their design. Layer upon layer of trash, creating a machine that had the sole purpose of destruction. *Just like the rebels.*

His eyes came to rest once more on the timer in front of him. Two hours, 3 minutes, and 57 seconds remained, it told him. He sighed, his shoulders feeling suddenly heavier, his fatigue finally overcoming the quiet contempt that had been simmering behind his golden eyes. ""With these, you shall be able to see as far as the galaxy stretches, sire,"" they had told him, prior to sticking them into his newly hollowed eye sockets. *They didn't very well help me see this, did they?* He allowed himself to smile at the thought, and made a mental note to have the doctors flayed, should he see them in the next life.

His finger moved to flip open the ornate switch on his armrest. He pressed it against the panel next to it, and heard the familiar *beep* that it had emitted the last twenty-odd times he had made the motions.  Every time, something had stopped him, though he had known the outcome of the battle since the start. This time, something was different. He no longer felt that inhibition. The button sank smoothly, calmingly. His fleet admiral stiffened.

They both heard the high-pitch whine of the warp drive as it went beyond its limits, emitting antimatter that was too accelerated to stay within its containment shield. They both felt the vibrations as the core began to overload and react. They both saw the shields begin to light up around the *First Sword* as the loose energy bounced off of the inside.

Before the infant supernova hatching in the womb of the ship enveloped him, Emperor Arnaud Constance Veritas II, former regent of the Eternal Empire, had time to think one final though.

*I was their only hope, and they have slaughtered me. They know not the enemy that comes. They have slaughtered themselves.*

*Fools.*

**Title: The Frost and Flame**

O’ tell me

How will we see

When our eyes are blind

And our souls are lost

Within the blistering cold

And against the shattering wind…



Tell me now,

How will we feel

Our touching embraces,

As we face the frost 

And run from the flames

Into the wild beyond?







**Title: Hope and Memory**

Where is the hope or memory

But far off in the silent recesses

Of a distant past

Locked away

In a mind that had long forgotten…



**Title: Silence and Echoes**

A majesty haunted us this day

Where the angels sang their songs

On that lonely plain

Where the souls of the dead

Had fought in vain



**Title: Beyond This Point**

Beyond this moment

Lays the corpse of a man from long ago

And standing next to the man

Was another, lanky and tall from head to toe

And he remembered the days

And he remembered the years

The friends and warmth

The kisses and tears

He remembered that moment

Those days from long ago

And maybe one day

Into the past he'll go

   A few steps before reaching the main floor, I wheeled around, almost tripping on the stair in front of me. In a panicky haste, I stumbled down the stairs into the basement. Despite my efforts on hiding it, I knew where the Book of Sand was. Still a little uneasy on my feet, I tripped over a stack of dusty books as I made my way across the room. A sort of muttered ‘sorry’ escaped my lips. I continued walking. As I approached the overflowing bookcase, the Book of Sand was the only thing in my field of vision.


   Its brown leather binding mocked me. I laughed aloud, even. I could feel the eyes of judgmental college students burning holes in my back. I didn’t care. They could worry all they wished. I was aware of my own state, without their approval. I laughed again at the absurdity of letting this book control my life. My back was red hot cinders by now, due to the students calling staff to watch the ‘crazy old man,’ motionlessly laughing at a grouping of books.


   With no preemptive movements, I viciously tore the cackling leather binding from the shelf. It almost looked as though it should belong there. Tearing it open, I began to rip, page after page out of the book whilst saying, “You will not control me. You are nothing but a bookish illusion, a gathering of paper and ink here solely to tear my sane life to shreds.” I turned to my audience as I said this, yelling to the world that a motionless, lifeless object could not – would not consume me.


   Gathering all the tattered papers from the floor, I looked at each of my audience member’s horrified expressions. Some of the women cringed back as I exclaimed, “Do not be afraid of me, I am but a crazy old man,” catching all of my lovely spectators in the eye.


   In a reverse motion, I stumbled up the stairs again. I missed the last step, landing upon my face. Scattered over the marble floor, the yellowed pages littered every inch of the otherwise silent room. Filling the acoustically kind room with my burdened breaths, I ran to the fireplace to perform the grand finale. A few pages remained strewn across the room.


   With still weighted breaths, I dropped the book of sand at my feet and kneeled in the mess of papers. The students and staff from the basement gathered at the foot of the stairs, not daring to take a step further, I had noticed from the corner of my bloodshot eyes.


   My breathing slowed as one by one, I placed each sheet in the fireplace, feeling oddly fatigued.


   Then there was nothing. No color to be seen. No texture to be felt. No music, laughter, or voices to hear. No smell of hearty dinners. No more of anything.

If you consider attempting to write for thirteen years of your short eighteen year life to still be within the ""I-am-a-noob-and-have-no-idea-what-I-am-doing-still"" range, like I do. 

I have unsuccessfully attempted to write more stories than I would care to admit over those thirteen years, and have failed them all. (of course I would, try writing a book as an Eleven year old. It just never works out.)

I recently have begun attempting to write in different ways, mainly, I have been trying to figure out my ending before I start my beginning. Or more accurately than that, I have been attempting to outline. 

I have a serious problem creating and maintaining a story while writing, either through discovery writing or my more recent attempts at outlining it all. 

Most recently I have come up with a very very very rough idea for a new story involving old dark fairy tales and a main character who is brought into their inner conflict. 

My problem is that I don't know what they are fighting over, I don't know how my main character is dragged into the conflict, I cant seem to figure out what happens in the middle bit (the meat of the story) and my ending is a complete bloody mystery to me. 

The few people I know who write, (a professionally published mother, a fellow novice writing friend who is off in college, and the sources I find on the web) still haven't been able to help fix this problem. 

So does anybody here have any advice? Opinions? Questions? I can even toss up the small bit that I do have if people want to see my writing style (I am mildly worried about it being stolen... but then I guess this is the internet, so whatever.) 

So... help? If you can? If you want? If it pleases you? idk xD just looking for some answers or ideas or magic pixie dust here.

Her feelings actually surpassed hatred, now there was a strong distaste for this man now. 

She had the money to pay for her own meal. It was bad enough that he thought her lineage was deserving of more regardless of her situation, but then to throw money like it grew on the trees of the old world. Quickly the girl stood up from her table and ran out of the restaurant after Mr. Hawkes. 

Fortunately the Thai restaurant was in the center of the lower dimension. It evenly separated the dimensions into five districts, the center being the market. There were only so many places that Mr. Hawkes could have escaped to, but Emilia was sure that he would be heated towards the tram. A long line of shops was the clear pathway to the tram station. The tram itself was in the ‘nicer’ part of the slums, if such a thing existed. 

Emilia carefully eyed each shop looking for Mr. Hawkes, without a hint of a delicate touch she dragged him into one of the many alleys off the street. 

 “If I consider your offer, what does this mean for me?” Emilia asked quietly, already aware at how awkward she had just made the current situation feel. 

“You would be a ward of the Hawkes family until you are eighteen and then added officially into the Hawkes lineage,” He answered surely, “You will never want for anything and your education will be far above average, which is what you are capable of.”

Emilia thought back to what sort of future the ship had intended for her mother. The woman had worked on the cleaning street robots. It was a complicated job but one of the only jobs that paid enough for them to eat well every week. As years had gone by a lot of the work her mother did had become automated. Money was harder to come by for the lower dimensional people. It was as if the higher people had forgotten their own workforce. At least now, with Mr. Emilia could look forward to a brighter future to achieve anything she wanted. 

She shook the thought from her mind. Why would anybody want to do something like that for her? As cocky as it may seem, Emilia wasn’t going to deny that she was smart, but at a cost, she was also lazy. But maybe that was because down here there wasn’t a future for smart people like her. Like her mother she would be doomed to repairing the street robots, maybe finding love and her life around.

“Can I give you an answer in class Monday?” Emilia asked, she couldn’t help but notice Mr. Hawkes look of glee. What was he so happy for, he was basically taking in a stray pet in Emilia’s mind.

Mr. Hawkes simply smiled his enchanting aristocrat smile and gave a polite nod. Emilia wondered if he had lost his words or if all of his proper training had not prepared him for an answer to something like this. 

“I’ll walk you to the tram.” Emilia offered, trying her best to ease the awkward situation.

“That would be nice,” Mr. Hawkes replied, still grinning like a child.

They wandered along the busy street, Mr. Hawkes occasionally stopping and asking if Emilia saw anything that she wanted. Regardless of Emilia’s answer he was always persistent in making a purchase but Emilia could be just as stubborn. She had taken to wandering ahead of him whenever it seemed he was about to make another offer on something. The item was always something shiny or something she had no use for. He was awful at understanding the everyday uses of a lower dimensional person. What good was make-up, nice clothes or jewelry to her? 

They continued together, down the path of shops, noticing that it had become less lively as it was before. There were fewer people than there should have been and many more stores appeared to be closed. It had only been a week since Emilia had visited this place last and it had been lively with the usual sort of people. Mr. Hawkes didn’t seem bothered by the absence of people but he did seem on edge.

“Maybe we should go to the other station,” Mr. Hawkes said slowly, his voice echoed down the empty path of shops.

The other station was far on the opposite side of the marketplace now. Emilia felt that he was right but at the same time she didn’t wish to go back. The air had even become heavier and the stench that the streets were normally known for was greater here. Emilia knew at the end of this street were a set of apartments, really the only ones in this dimension and the tram station. For those that could afford it, they had access to showers but water was heavily rationed and the tram was a convenient travel system for the lucky few that worked in higher dimensions.

Up ahead was the next districts door. It was tall and metal, possibly to try to keep out any unwanted. To the right of the door was a short goblin looking man who was seemingly affected by one of the numerous skin diseases of this dimension. He sold various things from water to clothes, the basics. His shop today seemed to be extremely overstocked for your average marketplace where most things were found by salvaging. Either this man had a very good salvage or he was a very talented thief. The man only watched Emilia drag open the metal door just enough for her and Mr. Hawkes to slip in. The doors didn't close behind them and Emilia wasn't going to close them either, just in case.

Before them was a bare street that seemed to have been dyed a dark reddish brown. Their feet stuck to the ground as they trotted along. It was dead silent here and nothing moved. Where could thousands of people go in a weeks time and nobody else know about it? Emilia immediately stopped asking herself this question. There were many secrets down here, things that nobody should know and things she didn't want to know. Up ahead she saw a small man sitting in a vehicle that she had never seen before. It wasn't even something she came across in the higher dimensions and it was surely not something from below. This had to be something far higher than she could imagine.

Here's a blog that lists some of them: http://nestersteachingblog.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/a-collection-of-oulipo-exercises/

I find the Oulipo pretty fascinating, though I'm not personally a fan of some of their exercises (like the N+7 poetry, it's like a Mad Lib, but with less room for creativity..). But I just really like the idea of using constraints as a way of getting through writer's block or freeing up some creative ideas.

I find using a technique similar to Queneau's Exercises in Style (http://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Style-Raymond-Queneau/dp/0811207897) to be really helpful if I get stuck in a story. Sometimes I realize that it actually works way better written in a completely different style--sort of like an extreme version of genre-bending.

I dangled my feet off the dilapidated dock. My toes barely skimmed the water's surface as I swung my feet back and forth. It was easy to pretend the world didn’t exist out here. My only companions were the seagulls in the sky and the fish who thought my toes were food. Flopping back and watching the clouds as they moved across the sky. On that day the sky could have easily have been confused with the reflection in the crystal clear water. 

It was easy to ignore the vibrations from the feet walking towards me as the sea breeze ever so gently kissed my face. Without looking, I guessed there were four of them, and they were most definitely men. Women didn’t smash their feet as they walked like these ogres were.

“Cadence,” the gruff voice interrupted my thoughts. “Are you going to come willingly or make us drag you out of here?”

“Let’s make this fun.” I stood up before one of the goons could grab me. “If you can catch me, I’ll go wherever you want.”

Before they even had a chance to say a word, I was in the water. Within seconds I stripped off my sundress, and I knew they were staring at my naked ass. But I couldn’t let that stop me. The clear water I was marveling at was now my enemy. I know they could see my every movement, but I doubt they could keep up with me.

That’s what they were after. My fish-like skills in the water. I didn’t know what I was and neither did they. But the people the goons worked for sure thought they could find out by sticking thousands of needles into me. They kept me drugged for days and then would throw me into a tank and would tell me to swim. I might as well have been a dying fish at that point.

I was so focused on the men behind me, that I wasn’t paying attention to what was in front of me. Down on the sandy bottom were two men just staring up at me. These two men were standing on the sand without any weights holding them down. They were not wearing masks, nor was there any scuba gear in sight.


In truth they looked just as amazed to see me zipping through the water as I was to see them standing there. Had the mad scientist finally figured out what I was? But if scientist didn’t, I’m pretty they could ask the two men on the bottom what I was.

The roar of a boat engine charging towards me didn’t give me a chance to stop and ask. But I had a feeling that this wasn’t going to be the last time I saw those two.

I turned and found death standing next to me. I could feel death looking over me with blank despair. He plunged his scythe into the earth. The ground blackened below me and the abyss grew darker than before. Rivers turned to blood and forests burst into a mighty inferno. People held their dead as the fires washed over them.

Fearing my own destruction I pushed death into the abyss. He made no sound. I drew his scythe from the earth. the ground turned green and life returned. Trees grew from the ashes. Wild animals returned and played in fields. The people climbed from their holes and rebuilt. The people lived in harmony with the earth and its creatures.

As time passed people forgot about the time before. The people grew greedy and hateful. The people slaughtered the animals and murdered their brothers. Towers were built as monuments to the sins of pride and greed. I still stood upon edge of the end of the world. The evil had corrupted the land and needed to be killed. I drew up death's scythe and plunged it into the earth once more.The towers crumbled and fell and the cities burned. Corpses covered the black ground. Mountains split and pools of magma erupted from the dying earth.

The people found me upon the edge of the end of the world. They crawled on broken limbs to my feet and begged for mercy. The people kissed my feet and offered me riches, women, and power. I had become the face of the destruction I feared. I welcomed it. Death knew what I know now. 

The dark maw of the abyss opened wider. It swallowed the world. The end of the world was upon us. The people cried out in screams of pain and agony. I made no sound.

what was watching her sleep. Since the night watcher started visiting, she was unable to stay 
asleep. As Cassandra drifted into dreamland, the bed would become weighted down, and she
knew her watcher was settling in even though she never saw who was there.
The few times when it had mistaken her for being asleep, it had brushed the hair off her face.

Then again, you might have not. His name was Jack. He was short for his age and he had freckles sprinkled on the bridge of his nose. Jack wore a button up white shirt, like his mother told him to do for first impressions and a bright red backpack laid across his shoulders. He took a deep, nervous breath as the sickly sweet smell of Paris tickled his nostrils. The smell of diesel from the train, burnt coffee beans, and freshly lit cigarettes penetrated the air. Jack coughed as he inhaled, it was so much different from what he was used to back home. 
 
His big blue eyes scanned his surroundings. The sun poured in through the big glass windows above and the dust dancing in the rays. He saw the giant wall clock and the hands turning ever so slowly. Like the clock was growing tired. Jack chewed on his lower lip (like he always did when he was nervous) and pulled out a crinkly black and white photograph of his cousin, Christophe, who was going to be picking him up.  Jack looked at the picture and around the crowd to see a sign of a familiar face, but there was none.
Jack was frightened by being alone. He saw Parisian business men in pressed suits and holding shiny briefcases sprint to catch the next train.  Getting jostled, Jack clutched onto his backpack and scanned the crowd.  Jack couldn’t see Christophe anywhere. He was going to abandon all hope, and then suddenly he heard his name. 
	“Jacques! Jacques! Jack!” 
		
Jack stood on his tiptoes and craned his neck to see where the source of the voice was coming from. He saw a tall man with hair the golden color of the sun and a well-trimmed beard. He pulled out the crumpled picture from his pocket and looked at it, the man calling his name was Christophe. 
	“Christophe! Christophe! Over here!” Jack waved his arms frantically.  Christophe came over and squatted in front of him. Christophe had amber eyes that smiled when he saw Jack. 
	“Ah, you must be Jack, eh? Well, it is nice to meet you, I am Christophe. Welcome to Paris.” 
Jack blushed and said hello. He was always nervous when he met new people. 
	“Come with me Jack. I will take you to my parent’s house. I have a taxi waiting outside.” 

Christophe extended his hand and Jack clutched it with his. They made their way through the crowd of people.When they finally got out of the train station a big black car was waiting for them, Christophe opened the car and gestured for Jack to go inside. 
	“After you,” he smiled. 

Jack glided on the leather seat, his feet dangling above the car floor. Christophe got in after him and mumbled an address and the car took off into the busy streets of Paris. Jack pressed his face against the window of the car and looked around the city. He saw tall and timeworn buildings with blue shutters around the windows next to modern department stores that were built out of glass. He saw Parisians sitting at outside cafes with cold drinks and smoking cigarettes. He saw stone alleyways and green leafy trees. Jack was amazed by Paris and he hadn’t even been there for the whole day. 
	Christophe laughed, “You like Paris?” 
	Jack’s spell of Paris was broken when he remembered Christophe was still in the car. 
	“It’s wonderful!” Jack exclaimed. 
	“Ah, you have your mother’s spirit!” Christophe said. 

Jack bit his lip and looked down at his sneakers. He missed his mother; he had never been away from her before. Christophe put a comforting hand on Jack’s shoulder. 
	“You miss her?” 
Jack nodded, “Very much.” 

Christophe reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a worn teddy bear. Its beige fleecy body was stuffed with cotton, a torn ear, brown button eyes, and a smile stitched in black thread. 
	“This is a gift, from me to you,” Christophe said. 
Jack examined the bear, the body was too small for the head and it drooped when Jack picked it up. 
	“What’s its name?” Jack asked. 
	“Oh Jack, you can name him whatever you like,” Christophe said. 
Jack looked at the bear again, squinted his eyes and he thought of a name, and decided on ‘Teddy’. They looked at each other and smiled and Christophe exploded with laughter. 
	“A brillant name ! Qu'est-ce l'intelligence!  What intelligence! Jack you are a genius!” 

Jack smiled and blushed again as he stuffed Teddy into his backpack. The car began to slow and it stopped in front of a tan looking house with eerie looking grey shutters and dead flower pots in front of a brown painted door. Even though the sun shone brightly on the house, it looked haunted and evil like someone had abandoned it to rot away. 

“Okay Jack, this is where I leave you,” Christophe informed him. 
Jack was shocked, “You mean you’re not coming with me?” 
“No, mon cousin, I believe I can’t. Now, you be careful with that bear. Don’t lose it. He’s a very special kind of teddy bear. You can show it to your Aunt Sylvie but don’t you dare let Uncle Laurent see it. Do you understand, Jack?” Christophe asked. 
Jack nodded and clutched his backpack to his chest. 
	“Now, go have fun in the boarding house, oui? I will come and see you tomorrow. Don’t worry,” Christophe smiled again as Jack got out of the car. 
“Au Revoir Jack,” Christophe waved and the car sped away. 

Jack turned around and faced the house. He walked over to the front door very slowly and knocked on the door. 
A short and skinny woman answered the door. Her face was taut and her lips were curled into a line. She wore a dingy yellow dress and her brown hair was turning grey. Her eyes reminded Jack of a Basset Hound that he had seen in a book full of animals. 
	“Are you my a-a-Aunt Sylvie?” Jack asked. 

The woman smiled and opened the door wider for Jack, he stepped in warily. He heard people upstairs arguing and cats meowing. He saw a creaky staircase and outdated pink wallpaper with flowers on it covering the walls. He could smell something boiling in the kitchen and it smelt like the inside of an old boot.
 A big and portly man walked out from the kitchen. He wore a maroon shirt and his pants were kept up by suspenders. He was bald on the top of his head but he still had tufts of white hair left. He had a big white mustache and it reminded Jack of the Monopoly man. 
	“Bonjour Jacques. I am your Uncle Laurent,” The man said with a deep voice, extending a hand. 	

Jack clutched his backpack straps and slowly stuck out a trembling hand to shake his uncle’s. 
	“Welcome to the boarding house Jack! Let me show you to your room,” Aunt Sylvie said, before Jack shook Uncle Laurent’s hand. 
	Uncle Laurent turned his hand into a fist, put it in his pocket, and went back into the kitchen.

Jack followed Aunt Sylvie up the stairs and to the left. He heard people arguing from above and people snoring from below. Outside the windows, he saw Parisians talking, laughing and drinking.  He heard glasses clinking and the murmur of voices. Aunt Sylvie went to go to turn on the hallway light but, to her dismay, the lights to fail to do so. 
	“Laurent! Où est la lumière? Where is the light ?” She called down to her husband. 
	“No light, ma belle, there is no power,” Jack’s Uncle Laurent called from above. 
Aunt Sylvie threw her hands in the air in frustration, 
	“Ack! Everything is cassé!” And she was right, everything was indeed broken. The floors creaked when Jack walked on them, some of the doors didn’t have doorknobs, and the wallpaper was starting to peel in some places. 
Jack looked down at his sneakers and gnawed on his lip. Was this all a dream?
	“Come boy, suivez-moi. Follow me,” Aunt Sylvie beckoned. 

Jack followed his Aunt Sylvie down the long and narrow hall. Every step they took, the floor creaked and lamented. As if to tell Jack to turn away. The whitewashed doors seemed even scarier and the sun light coming through the dusty windows didn’t seem so bright. He wanted to clutch to his aunt like he would do his mother, but that wouldn’t happen for a long time. Not when she was still in the hospital.
  
They came to the end of the hallway; Aunt Sylvie pulled out a skeleton key, unlocked the door and opened it. It was a small room, with a dirty window and a small iron cast bed. The green paint on the walls was peeling, revealing an off white color on the bottom. A small dresser was near the door and even smaller book shelf was below the window. 
	“Voilà, you sleep here, in Christophe’s old room,” she said.

Jack walked gingerly into the room. It smelled like must and moth balls. He put down his red back pack and began to pull out the contents. Comic books, foreign coins, ticket stubs, candy, and the teddy. His Aunt Sylvie went to the dresser and pulled out a pair of Christophe’s old pajamas. 
	“Here, you can wear these. These will be just your size. Your mother sent me an e-mail, the rest of your clothes will be here tomorrow,” She said, setting them on his bed. She was about to leave, when her eyes lingered on the teddy. 
	“Where did you get this?” She asked Jack. 

Jack scratched behind his ear as he thought of something to say, another thing his mother told him never to do when he answered to an adult. 
	“Christophe gave him to me.”

Aunt Sylvie made her eyes smaller and clacked her tongue. She went over to the book shelf and pulled out a leather bound book with gold designs. She held out a wrinkly hand to Jack. 
	“Here you go, mon neveu, my gift to you. It was Christophe’s favorite book. Now, dinner will be in a half hour. And with that she left and the door shut with a click.

1337063501.0,4,self.KeepWriting,tntp5,Prologue to a Novel I may or may nor write. Suggestions/critiques? (May be slightly disturbing),Revolan,4,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/tntp5/prologue_to_a_novel_i_may_or_may_nor_write/,"She was tied up. Why was she tied up? Her brain hurt trying to think through it. Why on earth was she tied up? She had never liked being tied up, even when her and Dan experimented around all those years back. The loss of control really took all the fun out of the experience. But her mind was wondering again. *“Why am I tied up?”* Perhaps it was a dream, a very bad dream. An omen of the future? No… that was crazy talk… 

*“Holy hell why can’t I think straight”* She thought. It reminded her of when she had experimented with some drugs as a college sophomore. *“Drugs! That was it!” But why?* She had given that part of her life up years ago when it became clear that she was going to be a mother with or without Dan. Perhaps it was some kind of tranquilizer? It soon became clear that even if the binds would suddenly loose, she doubted that she could find the will to get up- much less the strength.

*“How did I get here?”* She wondered. She tried to remember what she had been doing the night before, but all it gave her was a headache. “At least the pain signals whatever it was that I took, it’s wearing off, maybe in a little while I’ll even be able to untie myself.” For now she contented herself to examine her surroundings. It was a quaint little basement. Wood flooring gave it a feel similar to that of a cabin. There was a single post in the middle of the floor, to which she was tied. Thicker than her trunk, she immediately abandoned all hope of breaking it. Looking to her left yielded the famous poster of Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, and behind her was the doorframe. What she couldn’t see on the other side of the frame was an inscription that read the famous line “Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.” A Latin student may have translated it, but she would have remembered it if she had seen it for it was read to her when she entered. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. 

It started slow, as a few random flashes, but faster and faster her memory was starting to come back. She remembered tucking Christian in for the night, and walking to her bed. Then she flashes to the inside of the trunk, gagged of course, but she was obviously drugged at that point. Was the gag still in? *”Shit… how did I not notice that?”* The drugs were obviously affecting her more than she knew. She still could barely move after all. She couldn’t comprehend a reason that she would be in this situation, that another human being had drugged her and tied her up to do God knows what to her.

Then she heard it- a slow clunk, clunk of a man walking down the stairs. *“Help me!”*  She wanted to cry, but all that made it through the gag was an indiscernible whimper. When he made it to the door Janette looked into his face and a slew of buried memories came flooding back.  Him on top of her. Inside her. At first she had believed him to be Dan, the drunken state she was in. But then he started to get rougher. Dan may have liked role-playing, and he may have been a shit boyfriend who avoided commitment like the plague, but he never hurt her. No, never abusive or demeaning. Not that that particular thought crossed her mind, but after a few minutes her unconsciousness had begun to understand something was wrong. She began to struggle, little as she could in her state of mind. The man seemed to like that. He would smile and whisper things to her. Things she was glad to still not remember. He had gone on for hours, taking breaks when he needed them, and finally leaving after he had eaten his fill, but now he stood here, waiting it seemed like for the very glow of recognition her face now showed. Betrayed by her own emotions she started to struggle as he neared. When he stopped behind her, Janette thought her heart would burst before the sicko had the chance to kill her himself. Alas, this was not true. 

She panicked at first when she felt the rope slide around her throat. She kicked and kicked and groaned and screamed, but she couldn’t break free. As the oxygen deprivation crept in and slowly dragged her life away, she managed one last coherent thought. *“Christian”.*


The man smiled as her limp body slid to the floor. *That one was fun he thought. Perhaps I should let the drugs wear off on all my victims right before I kill them.* Let their conscious mind use the drugs to tap into a primal fear like the one the woman was obviously in just before she passed. Grunting under the weight, her picked up her lifeless body and carried her upstairs, outside and to the back. *“Who should I put this one with?”* He thought.  Her name was Janette if he remembered correctly- not that he really cared. Janette Barbie. He had remembered it purely because of the last name he recalled. *“Sounds like a slut’s name if I ever heard one. Perhaps I should put her with the Jock from last week. He liked sluts alright when I hired the hooker to lure him out.”* Of course, he had killed the bitch too. It was only responsible. Although she had seemed quite polite, so he refrained from raping her and ended her quickly with his favorite knife. A favor if he had ever heard of one, though perhaps it was a little self-serving as well. *“She WAS a whore after all”.* 

The basketball star had not been so lucky. Unfortunately for him he reminded the man of a bully from a long time ago in those awkward high school years. So the man castrated him. It was actually quite fun, the way his eyes got as big as dinner plates when he described what he was going to do. He had even been as nice to set up a mirror so the man could watch it happen. He died shortly after that, since the man hadn’t even bothered to close the wound. It was actually relatively fast as compared to other deaths he had delivered over the years. *“I must be getting soft. I didn’t rape the whore, I didn’t make the jock suffer, and I only raped that stupid Barbie slut for a night.”* He decided he would make up for it next time by doing two people at once. That brought a smile to his face as he disposed of the body. He hadn’t tried that for years, and the jock and the whore didn’t count because he had killed the whore where she stood. No use in bringing her back if not to rape her. Besides, she was just some street whore, nobody would notice, and less would care. 

Two-fers (which is what he called them) where quite fun. He enjoyed playing mindgames on them. Perhaps he would beat one more than the other, rape the second one less. One time he had even gotten one girl to kill the other. He had stalked the cheer squad for weeks, observing their social dynamics before specifically picking these two, the captain and the jealous squadmate who was obviously better. He had wanted to get the girl to turn on the captain and ‘claim’ her rightful place, but it turns out the other wasn’t captain for no reason. As soon as it was clear what he was trying to get them to do, the piece of firewood he had thrown in there to spice things up went to good use, and the captain stood victorious. And true to his word, he set the winner free. She didn’t make it a quarter mile before he was on top of her with his knife. Good god the blood was amazing. *""Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.”*

As he drove home his thoughts started to drift there as well. *“I wonder if Sandra has dinner cooked yet.”* He hoped the baby hadn’t given her much trouble. He was rather fond of her. It was as close to love as one like him could get. She kept house quite well, and she had no equal in bed. *“The sex is always better after a kill anyways.”*  As he arrived home, she greeted him at the door. “Welcome back honey, how was work?” 

“Alright I suppose. Dinner ready yet?”

“Of course” she smiled. “Harrison is in bed already, so be quite unless you’re going to stay up with him.

The meal was one of his favorites, rare steak (the blood reminded him of his… extracurricular activities) and mashed potatoes. As Sandra went into the kitchen for more tea, she called for him. “Michael come quick!” She screamed.

1335930227.0,4,self.KeepWriting,t2qcu,Synopsis for the novel I'm writing (with intent to make it a series),xanothis23,4,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/t2qcu/synopsis_for_the_novel_im_writing_with_intent_to/,"Before I begin the synopsis i want to post the google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-X2uluwHSWhArVX8wEJr7T5MHtAzBpMOoS7wQ4nHEw8/edit)

Anyway, my idea is this. It's the story of a man with a supernatural ability to cause people to die, as in the prologue, he gets visions on how to do so. The catch is, if he doesn't kill them himself, they are going to do something worse. (I cant say much without giving the plot away but he's had two examples of this and they do no turn out well.) In the first book, since I am setting up the ground for a potential series, as well as trying to make it as interesting as possible, its about him dealing with his life as some people close to him begin to discover his ability. As well as him dealing with a rather odd case of someone who seems to have defied his ""gift"".

The theme overall is more of a ""is what he doing right?"" Seeing as how he's technically killing innocent people. Basically i want to know what you guys think of the idea for the story. Any grammar errors or what not I will take care of myself in future revisions, i'm more interested in thoughts (would you read it, it sounds alot like *blank* etc.)

Let me know what you think, i'm going to write some more and hopefully try to get some reading done since i feel like i've been selfish in seeking criticism without giving any.

I'd figure Reddit could help me out, so I came here looking for some criticism on my current idea. It's a mildly long fantasy story, set in a kingdom during a time of peace, riches and all that stuff. I haven't worked out the names or anything like that, just a basic plotline. So, enough with the fluff talk, here's the idea:

1. During a time of prospering, a queen of a large empire is assassinated.
2. A person about 18 years old gets mugged on the street. Just before the attacker chooses to kill the victim, a mysterious man comes in to save his hide, but quickly disappears.
3. After a long period of time, the victim of the mugging is kidnapped by the mysterious man.
4. After explaining why he had to kidnap the kid, he reveals himself as the assassin who killed the queen. He explains that the queen and her husband were actually very corrupt and dishonest, to the point where they would hire cutthroats to help them earn money and whatnot.
5. The boy believes him, and the man tells him about his scheme to kill the king and end his corrupt rule.
6. After a long period of training to be an assassin, the boy and the man launch their complicated scheme to kill the king.
7. They successfully complete the job, with the entire royal bloodline destroyed.
8. After reading a few secret notes to and from the man, the boy finds out that he was nothing more than a jealous younger brother of the king, seeking him to be killed.
9. The boy confronts and kills the man after a long fight.
10. Since the boy devoted his life to killing silently, he continued to work as a contract killer, eventually leading to his death on a mission.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,True,,,True,t3_t0mv9,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/t0mv9/what_do_you_think_of_my_mildly_long_story_idea/,

Everyone rushed from their cars and into their warm homes to be greeted with open arms by their families. I stood beneath a tree, trying to stay dry while looking upon a house with sad eyes, wishing I had a family of my own to return to. Unfortunately I was not a lucky one. All that I did know was my name, Kimi.
	Unconsciously I brushed the necklace that hung delicately around my neck. Crafted in a material that was unknown to me, was my name. I’d had it for as long as I could remember. Growing up in foster homes, it was the only link I had left of my original life. Ever sense then I had been in and out of foster homes, living on the streets in between. That was back in 1805.
	While my body stopped growing around age 20, I lived on. I wasn’t sure what was going on, all I knew was that whatever it was, was not normal. I learned right away that running was my only option. Occasionally it was safe enough for me to re-enter society as just another lost person, but I only stayed long enough to get a few nights good sleep and meals and new clothes. Sometimes the shelters were nice and it would be hard to leave, but I knew deep down I couldn’t stay.
	Turning away from the house I put up my hood and walked deeper towards the center of town. This was my fourth night in this town, I honestly should have moved on by now but something was keeping me here. I learned long ago to trust my instincts. I was tempted to get myself caught by the police, letting them take me to in for the night. Or maybe find a local shelter house, It had been a few months sense I had a hot meal, good clothes, hell even a hot shower would feel amazing. But something happened, something terrible, which made it so I couldn’t show my face any more.
	Two weeks ago my left cheek and forehead started itching unbearably. I thought at first that I had a run in with some poison ivy. After a miserable day of pain, burning, and itching it suddenly stopped. I tried to brush it off but I started getting looks by random strangers over the next few days. One old lady even cursed at me and started ranting on about stupid teenagers and tattoos. I found the nearest public washroom and there on my face, was a tattoo. Five dots now lined the top of my left cheek and a snowflake like pattern adorned my forehead, like a bendi.  I tried to take it in stride. I mean, what else could surprise me after being alive for the past two hundred years or so? Unfortunately I didn’t realize at the time how easily recognized I was now that this. . . thing, was permanently attached.
But in light of the misery I felt this town was beautiful; though I had no idea as to what it was called. There were times, usually late into the night that I came close to calling it home. But that was foolish, was it not? What exactly was keeping me here? Was it the friendly neighborhood folks? Or was it the almost constant forest and wild life? I had no idea, but as I hurried through that pouring rain and under an overpass to wait it out I started to think. Why couldn’t this be home to me? What was stopping me from finding a semi safe tunnel and ‘building’ a home?
	As I slid down the overpass wall and curled into a tight ball to fight off the cold I knew I already had that answer.
	Fear.

...........................................................................................................

George was looking furiously around him, in search of someone in charge.
He has been trying to recline his seat for over a hour, But the mechanism wouldn't work.
He was getting really annoyed by now, and considered going to the front of the bus and giving the driver a good shout. George knew it wasn't the driver's fault, but when he was angry he absolutely had to shout on someone to feel better.

He looked around and noticed that most of his fellow passengers were asleep, their seat in a fully reclined position. This just made him even angrier.

""This stupid seat just has to ruin everything."" George thought to himself, ""Why can't they check the state of the bus once in a while, for goodness' sake"".

Time passed by and George just couldn't get himself to sleep.

This was a long bus ride, from the center of Australia to Sydney and most of the passengers were tourists, like George. The old lady in front of George looked Scandinavian, and the young slim guy behind him was probably French or German. George didn't really care,  but yet this little game kept him busy for a while.

George tried to think about all the places he will visit, all the people he will meet, But he couldn't concentrate. The fact that he was the only one who couldn't enjoy the comfort of a reclined seat kept nagging him.
He looked around him with the most unsatisfied face expression he could conjure, And hoped that someone will notice him and do something.

 He suddenly spotted a policeman.
""Perfect, an authority I can blame for everything."" He thought.
 ""Hey you, mind - "" He tried to say, but the policeman just pressed the button on the side of his seat and fell asleep immediately.
""Well I guess he was tired"" He thought, "",stupid bastard.""

More time passed by and it was nearing midnight. George found himself literally the only person awake. He was already getting very tired, but couldn't fall asleep. George had some really rare condition, because of which he could only fall asleep lying on his back.

And then he lost it. He didn't care that no one will hear him, he just wanted to get his anger out.

""FOR GOD'S SAKE, CAN SOMEONE COME HERE AND HELP AN OLD MAN RECLINE THIS STUPID, WORTHLESS SEAT?!"" He shouted with all his might.

His shouting had absolutely no effect on the passengers, They were as slumber as they had been before, yet the bus driver probably heard him because the bus stopped abruptly.

The bus driver came out of his cabin and said ""There's no need to shout mister"".
He has slowly walked towards George, then got a screwdriver and opened the seat's side panel. After about half a minute he said ""All fixed, now try and recline your seat.""
The bus driver smiled at George. It was a very cold smile, mixed with anticipation and greediness.
George didn't think much of it and pressed the button on the side panel.
For a moment he felt relief, but then without warning he felt a  strong pain near his heart.
George was dead in a matter of seconds, like everyone else in the bus.
 

....

The driver quickly scanned the bus, and with a satisfaction on his face hauled George on his back.

""Don't worry little sharkies, daddy always feeds you on time, always"".

""Is that what you were, then?  A ghost?""

Simon paused before answering.  It seemed like the best definition of what he had been.  In that place he 

was a wandering soul, overwhelmed with regrets and drained of hope.

""I suppose so, but then, what am I now?"", he asked.

The doctor ran her fingers through her short brown hair.  A thoughtful expression remained on her face for a few seconds before she spoke.

""I don't know.  From what you've told me, it's not your fault you were brought here.  If anyone knows, it's probably yo--Dale's mother, Helen.""

""You're probably right.  Next time I see her, maybe I'll get a chance to ask.""

Simon checked his watch.  It was 3:15.

""Anything else before I go, doc?""

She thought a moment, then raised her eyebrows and smiled slyly.

""How are things at school?  Looking forward to another rugby season?""
Simon chuckled.

""I know I am.  Can't say the same for the other guy.""

""Alright, good luck.  Until next time.""

""See ya.""

Simon laid his head back.  Overhead, his reflection in the mirrored ceiling copied his motions, but the 

eyes, as usual, showed disapproval.  As Simon's mind faded into the background, Dale made his way back up.

A Bus Crashes And You Continue On Your Way

The 68 bus uptown is running off schedule again and you’re already going to be late. It’s a constant thing in your life, running late. It’s not that you’re particularly busy, you just lose track of time. It’s raining and it’s a little cold and you wish that you had brought a heavier jacket.
	The bus finally arrives and you sit the fourth seat back on the right—you always try to sit there. It’s comfortable for you. There’s a lady sitting across from you with a red coat and a red bag, blue jeans, and red boots. Holding her hand is a man, probably 25 or so, wearing a black coat with black boots. You don’t care to notice anybody else. 
	You put in your headphones and select The Dead Kennedys on your ipod, and you start to think what life would be like if this bus crashed. What if the driver looks at someone yelling from the back and hits another bus head on? You think of all the death, you think maybe you’d die. You can picture the cut up faces and the broken bones with clarity.
	It’s your stop. You take out your headphones, roll them up, put them into your pocket and walk down to the coffee shop. She’s already inside, so you go in and meet her. 
	“The weather is always shitty here,” you say. 






Finite Search for Happiness

It’s that one time he forgets to lock the front door, and it’s the first time he comes home to find his house completely torn apart. It’s the first—and probably the last time he’ll see his wife dying on the kitchen floor. Still, the coffee is hot in its glass carafe, and the beer is still cold in the fridge while the television quietly plays the local news station. 
	It’s the overwhelming joy that brings this man to tears; it’s the new profound happiness that he can already begin to feel. He didn’t even have to do this himself. He calmly calls the police, moves to the fridge, grabs his drink, and quietly waits on the front porch. The TV still hums in the background. 






Return to Sender

	The line at the post office moves incredibly slow as I wait to send correspondence to a long lost friend who might already be dead. I’m in trouble, I explain to him, and I don’t know how to get out of this. I walk back home and find bottles and used condoms everywhere, and I walk up the stairs and into the bedroom when I see her there with the third guy this week. I told her I wanted her to leave, that she couldn’t stay here anymore, but to no regard. She knows I’m away for long periods of time and she assumed I would never find out. 
	I drag the guy out of my bed, give him a solid knock in the face, and lead him to the door. I grab his clothes that were balled up at the corner of the bed, douse them in some fuel I brought home today, and light them on fire out in the backyard. I shouldn’t have had to do this twice. 
	I wake her up, try to ask her why she keeps doing this, but she’s too drunk to answer. You know your job kills you when your wife sleeps with half the town every time you’re away. They never say anything. It’s not their problem, they think. I’m sure they talk about it in the barbershops and in the bars, at the grocery stores and at work. They won’t tell me, they think I’m bound to go insane. Why would I do that? 
	It’s another night sleeping on the couch, I guess. I wake up and she’s gone with my car, and she left a note that says I should burn in hell and that all she ever wanted was for me to be around. 
	Out of spite, I will invite her back.

*****

Everyone can recall that crushing boredom. You were a kid on summer vacation. You were free from school, but stuck following your parents around some museum or landmark you had no interest in. Other children exchanged knowing and sympathetic looks with you, and the experience was forgotten the moment Dad announced that it is time to go find dinner. 
   
My own visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington DC, accompanying my father and uncle, veterans of that distant era, started out as just such a trip. I was too young to grasp the significance of the war for their generation, and the sacrifice and loss represented by those 58,000 names, engraved on black marble, was certainly beyond my comprehension. In my mind it was just a cemetery, filled with people I didn’t know, who died decades before I was born.  
  
Even so, the weary and tight lipped faces of the middle aged men all around me, the odd silence, broken only by whispers, distant traffic, and the occasional sound of a breath catching in someone’s throat conveyed, even to a boy of only 10, the sanctity of that place. It seemed my father stood on the opposite side of a chasm of experience and age that I could not hope to cross.  
  
20 years later, that hot summer day lost in the fog of memory and time, I found a bridge across the divide. It stood in a quiet corner of the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. 
   
It struck me like a lightning bolt; The sudden flash of understanding took my breath away. It isn’t about the names engraved in marble. Those dead men know nothing of a great wall made of black stone. It is not simply a memorial to the dead, but a repository of the memories of those who lived. It is a reminder to the men who came back alive that they did not experience that distant hell alone. It is the last bastion of the experience itself.  
  
Before me, surrounded by historic aircraft and military relics, was a room I knew from a different life. Two simple white walls, covered in black grafitti. Those plywood panels were one transplanted corner of the Passenger Terminal at Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar: The gateway to Iraq and Afghanistan. The first place my boots touched sand. Standing there in that air conditioned hangar, it seemed as if I could smell the metallic, earthy aroma of sand once more. It was the smell of heat.  
  
I was 19 the first time I touched the wall. It was the spring of 2004. Just months before, I sat in History class, watching CNN as the first bombs fell on Baghdad. Watching history happen. In what seemed like an instant, I found myself standing among those ruined buildings.  
  
I was a clueless airman, surrounded by 207 cocky young men and women. It was the start of a long deployment, the first of many for some of us. We were itching to do our job and go home.  
  
Save a few scattered signatures and doodles, the wall was white with a thin coat of khaki dust. A black marker appeared as if conjured, and a few of my friends endeavored to leave their own mark as we waited for some bureaucrat to sign some form nobody would ever look at again.  
  
The last time I saw it, I slumped against the wall, dreaming of sleep, awaiting the airlift home. I was surrounded by the same men and women, 14 months older but aged beyond their years. We were fewer in number, but we carried those we had lost with us as memories, tattoos, and scars. By then, the wall was nearly black with the rantings and boasts of a hundred thousand troops that had waited impatiently in that broken down hut. The passenger terminal was the first stop on the way in, and the last stop on the way out. Those plywood walls were bookends. Written on the pages between was the best, and worst, of us.  
  
A piece of that wall traveled through time and space, 10 years and 10,000 miles to find me, leaning against it once more, in a quiet corner of a museum in Dayton, Ohio.  A flood of memories and emotion engulfed me. Loyalty and love for my friends, respect for the men who led us, pride in my troops, and grief for the loss of so many lives. In an instant, those countless moments, dulled by years and miles, snapped into perfect focus.  
  
Thousands of names, units, dates, and home towns had been scrawled in black marker on the stark white panels. Every inch expressed the pride and anger and joy and loneliness and hope and sorrow and frustration of a generation of Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen. Those marks were made by men and women I knew and loved as brothers and sisters.  
  
*“Then shall our names, familiar in his mouth as household words... Be in their flowing cups, freshly remember’d.”* - William Shakespeare, 1599  
  
  
Even now, it reverberates in my head. The Bard had it right. There were half a dozen names on the wall that were as familiar to me as my own. With my hand on that wall, I could see them all as if they stood before me. Mule’s wild gestures and superlatives, Wolf’s love of poker and those damned sunflower seeds, Buick’s fake tough guy persona, Hammer’s big dopey grin, towering above me. The living and the dead returned to me, freshly remembered.  
  
I watched those men write on that wall. At the time it was nothing more than a way to pass the hours while awaiting the perpetually delayed airlift. It became a testament to the world that they did their job. They mattered.  
  
We mattered. Perhaps to no one other than the men and women that stood beside us, but that is enough.  
  
Those people served, and returned home, with honor. Many of them returned to Al Udeid with me time and again in the following decade. A few, we carried home. Not one of them expected they would one day find their signatures enshrined in the halls of a museum, giving voice to their service and sacrifice. Proof, for the world to see, that they were there.  
  
How many thousands of patrons amble past that wall each day, puzzled by the apparent non-sequitur with the rest of the museum, oblivious to the significance of the place, and the time, and the circumstances that created it?  
  
I can't think of a better monument to those that served in Iraq and Afghanistan, than one drawn by their own hands. It is as much a proof of life for the living, as a memorial for the dead.  
  
The great societies of the world have cut monuments for the ages in marble and bronze, but perhaps all that is really needed, is a black marker, and a white wall.

I’m going to die.

My name is Nick McAllister, I’m 23 years old, and I’m going to die.

I know that I’m going to die because that’s what the doctor said.  He didn’t say it as directly as that, he used words like ‘inoperable’, and ‘metastatis’, and ‘malignant’.  That’s a fun word.  I didn’t know what it meant at first.  I knew that there were two kinds of tumor you could get, benign and malignant, and I knew that one was bad and the other was good (as good as a tumor can be, I guess).  Basically one meant that you still had a chance to live if they managed to remove all the cancer from you.  But the other one meant that even with treatment the cancer would just start spreading more and more.  Usually it meant that it already had.  As luck would have it, the tumor that was growing inside my brain turned out to be malignant (that’s the bad one).

They didn’t know it was malignant at first.  We did surgery to remove the bulk of it and chemotherapy shortly after, but further tests showed it was still there and growing.  We of course got our hopes up and thought that we could beat it, but sure enough the damn thing came back and with it the news that I was going to die.
I’m at peace with it now.  It’s been a couple months since the diagnosis and I’ve already been through every stage of grief in that time.  I’ve finally arrived at acceptance.  I’ve accepted the fact that I won’t live to see my 30s.  That I won’t get married and have a family.  That I won’t live out the American Dream and buy a big house and two cars and grow old and all the other crap that goes with that.  I’ve made peace with the fact that I won’t get to do those things.  I’ve cursed myself and others for my situation.  Asked God why.  Why me.  Seen all the sad looks on the faces of my friends and family, which only made everything harder.  It’s been a rough couple months, but I think I’ve come through it alright.  I feel good now, I’ve accepted my fate.  Now all I can do is wait for the pain to get worse and worse until I eventually die.  The anticipation is killing me.  Haw haw.

I’ve decided to spend more time outside.  I used to play a lot of video games to pass the time, but now they really don’t interest me like they used to.  I guess knowing that I’ve only get a short amount of life left, I figure I’d rather spend it experiencing things that are real instead of staring at a hi def TV screen showing me things that are not.  My shrink tried to tell me the reason I stopped was because I was being confronted with my own mortality, and so subconsciously I didn’t want to surround myself with all the death and killing like in those “violent vidja games”.  I told him he didn’t know what the hell he was talking about as I was the one dying here and not him, then I stormed out of his office.  Dick.

Maybe he was right, I don’t know.  Not that it really matters anyways.  It doesn’t change anything.

So yeah, that’s where I’m at.  I’ve accepted that I’m gonna die, but I’m not looking forward to all the pain near the end.  I’ve already experienced enough pain as it is, and I don’t look forward to more of it.  The thought has crossed my mind to just end it now.  Spare myself all the extra pain and suffering and just be done with it all.  But then I think of how hard this has been on my family.  My parents, my two sisters and their families.  I think if I ended it, it would just make it harder on them.  If I have more time I think it will make it easier on them; allow everyone to make peace with it and say their goodbyes.  Sure, it’s gonna suck going through all that, but this whole experience hasn’t been easy, why should it be any easier now?

But I reserve the right to change my mind.  If it gets to be too bad I still could kill myself.  Or if I find that my family has said enough goodbyes and I’m just dragging it out by staying alive, I could do it then.  I don’t know how it’s all gonna go down towards the end, we’ll just have to wait and see.

But in the meantime, on nice days, I’ve been trying to go for long walks outside.  Enjoy nature.  Today I’m going to head up to Mount Locke.  There’s a nice hiking trail that goes to the summit, which should give a good view of the entire valley.  Should keep me occupied for the day.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1ji6hu,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1ji6hu/feedback_malignant_intro_828_words/,
1374781064.0,2,self.KeepWriting,1j1qi7,Critique Needed,,5,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1j1qi7/critique_needed/,"I am reading a book for a friend, and wondered what a few of you may have thought about this story. 

Here is a sample of his writing, please provide input as to what you think of this writing. 

Quietly Ho-thuk crept through the Rotevasa swamp, following a winding blood trail through a big briar patch. A Gerri close to his age followed closely. The Gerri’s grandfather was with him too, but the old man wisely waited outside the thick, prickly mass of vegetation for the boys to return. Both were young, and for both it would be their first look at death. The briar patch was laden with thorns and Ho-thuk was irritated that the blood trail had led straight into it. Deep into the briar patch, calmly awaiting Ho-thuk, was a wounded doe. She was beautiful and serene. The animal was not mortally wounded, yet still did not attempt to escape. Rather, she seemed to be resting, as if ready to accept the end. Ho-thuk turned to the unwitting accomplice and said... Do you have a knife on you? No. Ho-thuk looked upon the elegant animal knowing he must put the animal down. He was told by his father before the hunt to cut the animal’s throat to end its suffering, but alas he did not bring a knife. The Gerri was only part of the scenery and offered nothing. Ho-thuk raised his Shine club slowly, and with a vicious blow put a hole bigger than a grapefruit in its skull, exposing gray matter to the environment. Death was instantaneous. The beautiful creature would never have to run again. Ho-thuk felt no joy in ending this innocent animal’s life. Rather, he felt like he had taken something precious and destroyed it. The Gerri people had a strange ritual for a hunter’s first kill; dousing the killer with the victim’s blood and guts. Shortly after arriving at base camp Ho-thuk learned of the impending ritual and disappeared into the woods unnoticed. Ho-thuk’s father, Mur-ul, along with his first cousin, Cha-nin, went searching in the woods for him. The Gerri hunting party joined in the search. Ho-thuk found a small tributary nearby and silently hid close to its bank. He could hear the search party looking for him, and several times he was so close that he need but reach out to touch one. This hot, humid day in the Gerri’s swamp would be a memorable for the young Chakota, and not in a good way. After several hours the search was called off. Ho-thuk mistakenly thought his disapproval of the ritual had set in and it would be safe to return. Calmly he strode out of the woods and back to camp. Upon arrival he did not see his father or best friend, only the Gerri hunting party numbering close to thirty. Unfortunately his family had left down the home path to look for him, unintentionally leaving him at the mercy of strangers. Ho-thuk sensed he had made a mistake when the Gerri stopped conversing, and knew it when they spread out and assumed a hostile stance. He was outnumbered and trapped. Seeing his situation as dire, he took off around the camp, but flanking Gerri cut off his retreat.
Quick moves and fast feet allowed Ho-thuk to evade capture for a short time. He doubled back to where the clan had originally assembled and a big, heavy-set Gerri stepped directly in the middle of his escape route. Ho-thuk lowered his shoulder and attempted to take the massive Gerri head on, even though the man was easily twice his size. The heavy-set Gerri absorbed the blow, being knocked back a couple feet, but held fast to the struggling young Chakota. A couple Gerri grabbed a bucket of the deer’s blood and splashed Ho-thuk. The entire clan burst out in laughter, and Ho-thuk could not help but laugh himself. Not from being doused with his first kill’s blood, but from almost getting out of the trap unscathed. Mur-ul and Cha-nin came back to camp while he was rinsing the dried blood off. They had quickly realized he was not on the home trail after a short march. First thing they wanted to hear about was the bloody coronation they narrowly missed. Both laughed hard and regretted not being able to see the christening in person. Ho-thuk did not share the same view, and did not think being splashed with blood a great way to start the morning. It was going to be a sticky and blood-scented trek home for the young Chakota. The group walked till sunset and camped under the Blood Star that night. Ho-thuk was not able to get all the blood out of his hair or clothes and still reeked from the morning’s coronation. They built a low fire and roasted venison left over from the hunt for dinner. Everyone was tired from the day’s events so the mood was light and talks minimal. Ho-thuk had to sleep without a proper bath, that and the glow from the Blood Star made him quite irritable and short-tempered. He tossed and turned all night, and was glad to see the Sun rise to banish the Blood Star into obscurity. They broke camp at dawn and continued their journey home. They had not walked far when they came across a small pond with crystal clear water, shimmering in the morning sunlight. Ho-thuk ran and jumped in head first. His dad and cousin joined him with a boisterous set of splashes. He felt like he had been baptized. After a short swim they continued the long march home. The Sun shone intensely and the day was already shaping up to be leaps and bounds better than the last. Around noon Mur-ul spotted a big buck with a large rack. The majestic beast grazed near a pine forest, not far from the Dark Water River bridge crossing. He told the boys to stay back and remain very quiet. The young hunters watched intently, studying him as he moved within striking distance of the buck; gliding with the stealth of a shadow. The minutes that passed seemed like an eternity. The light breeze was shifting downwind so Mur-ul needed to make a shot soon.
THWANG…THUMP They heard the bow sing and the arrow hit the target with a sickening thud. The eight point buck did not know what hit it and dropped on the spot; heart cleaved almost in two. The metal arrow went right through the buck and embedded two hands into a nearby pine.

She slept but did not dream, waking often. Each time she did, she saw the boy with his back to her, crouched or laying and watching the curtained entrance. Eventually a red light crept in and chased away the darkness. In that pale light, they left the shelter, setting out at a careful walk. As they began, she saw him clearly for the first time.


He was probably her own age, perhaps slightly older but not by much. His hair was a dark red, turned almost fiery by the red light of Querra. Almost as thin as she was, he bore an olive complexion and eyes the color of the frozen lakes of Meda. Those eyes looked at her on occasion and he seemed to be on the verge of asking a question but remained silent. It was Aderyn who spoke first.


“Why?”


“Why what?” he said, looking back at her.


“Why did you save me?”


He frowned, looking like he didn’t understand. “You were a servant, a prisoner of theirs. We free those we find made to be servants or…” he blushed and looked away. “Or whatever else.”


He thinks I’m a groundling, a maid or…


She looked away from him to hide her shock and pressed dirty fingers to her lips, not trusting them to blurt out the truth. *They would have killed me, would have left me to die if they knew! If they find out… If…*


“What happened?” she said after she trusted herself. “At the War, I mean?”


He shrugged, still not looking at her. “We struck at them. We were given the time and location and so we freed them.”


“The groundlings?”


“Of course,” he said, looking at her now with a quizzical expression. “Who else?”


She nodded, swallowing a sudden spike of fear. “And, and the nobles?”


His expression turned dark and he turned away. “We killed as many as we could but surprise only works for so long and we didn’t have too many bombs. We didn’t have enough power packs to really fight it out. We meant to free the groundlings and disappear.”


*Bombs? Power packs? Like my hair clip?* She licked her lips, tasting mud. She didn’t like the way it felt against her teeth, grainy and cold. Spitting, she tried in vain to clear it until the boy handed her a bottle of water. She took it in silence and washed her mouth with it before taking a sip.


“I’m Resh,” he said when she handed it back. “Thought you, well, might want to know.”


“Aderyn,” she said, giving him what she hoped was a grateful smile.


“Your accent, it’s not Querran. So you’re not part of Revnari’s House. Where are you from?”


Her heart suddenly started thumping loudly in her ears as she inwardly panicked. Of course he would notice her accent! She couldn’t tell him where she was really from, could she? Would he know of the Medani family and their Null daughter? So, hoping he couldn’t see how frightened she was, she lied.


“Hyperia,” she said. “I was… I was…” she blushed, thinking rapidly to the women who had bustled about within Ian’s keep. The boy, Resh, reached out and touched her arm. “It’s okay,” he said. “That life is over now. You won’t have to do any of that again.”


His concern, his sympathy, surprised her. He looked away from her before she could think of anything to say. Part of her felt sickened by this lie, this fiction she was constructing, but another part of her knew she had to. If he knew the truth, he’d kill her, or at best, leave her here alone.


“What will we do now?” she said after a time.


“We’re heading toward the tunnels. They’re not far but I don’t want to go straight to them. It’ll be dark before we get there though. Gets pretty dark early in this valley.”


“Tunnels?”


“Where we’re hiding,” he said, turning to give her a small smile, his lips curving just slightly at one side. “We’ll be safe there. The resistance is based there.”


*Resistance?* She nodded quickly, trying to process this information. “You mean you’re fighting the Querrans?”


He nodded, once again offering that lopsided grin. “All the nobility actually. It’s pretty small right now, but we’re starting to communicate with some other worlds. Small ones at first but soon we might even have some groups on Orion.”


Aderyn nodded, staring up through the thick canopy of the trees. She didn’t know what to think. Resh and his… resistance killed Redrick and maybe the rest of them. Maybe even...


Aderyn gasped, her hands pressing against her mouth as the shock washed over her. *Mother. The Queen! Oh the Queen!* Did he know? Did any of them know who was in that viewing platform?


“What’s the matter?” he asked.


She couldn’t speak, couldn’t find any words to formulate some lie for her distress. What could she possibly tell him? She had to get away from this boy! Had to warn them, warn her father! The King! The whole galactic Collective!


“Aderyn? Are you okay? What’s wrong?”


“Nothing!” she said, squeezing her eyes shut. “It’s just… my… my mistress was on that platform, and my… I…”

He touched her arm again, and she felt that gentle pressure meant to reassure her. “She won’t harm you again. They’re all dead.”

Part 1: http://mikekernfiction.com/2013/02/13/the-blood-part-1/

They walked through the sitting room. Aderyn’s cheeks were still hot but she tried to push away her frustration and irritation. Her mother never changed. Her children were assets or liabilities, just like good soldiers to her father’s fleet. If one was not pulling their weight, they were reprimanded or discarded. She needed to be strong.

“I have secured us a place next to the Nevans, a minor House with only a single world to their name, but growing wealthier. They’ve discovered two Jump Nodes in their system that lead directly to Orion. I’m sure Lord Kellen will move quickly to secure them, so an alliance with Nevan would mean an alliance with the Orions. You understand, of course.”

It was not a question. Aderyn did not say yes or no. She was not expected to answer, but to merely understand. Marry a Nevan and we gain a connection to the Orions. Simple enough. Or it would be, for a full Blooded.

They crossed through the sitting room and into the observatory. Showcasing an enormous bubble viewing window, the observatory was a great round room made for sitting and watching the grandness of space. Aderyn saw ships docking with the Starkeep. Some were merchant ships, but most were warships. Carracks and cruisers and destroyers. In the distance, she even saw a massive carrier. Father’s flagship has arrived.

“Mother,” Aderyn began, speaking tentatively. “I thought the war would be made on the Querra homeworld? Why has father called the fleet?”

“Hm?” Her mother sat on one of the long, arching benches that hugged the observatory’s bubble window. She glanced outside and then waved a hand dismissively. “Your brothers wished to fly down. It will make a great spectacle for the Querra House and impress our liege lord as well. Honestly daughter, I sometimes wonder if you are as slow as you are late.”

Aderyn turned away, determined not to say another word. While angry, she knew that was simply mother’s way. If Aderyn asked why she said such painful words, her mother would be confused, not understanding why she was upset. Several minutes passed in silence before she spoke up, a question unable to be contained.

“Why are we waiting here mother? Shouldn’t we be going to the ship too?”

Her mother did not answer right away, but sat staring out at the carrier ship. Her gray eyes seemed far away, a slight frown pinching the corners of her mouth. Is she troubled? Aderyn wondered.

“Mother?”

“Mm? No, we shall be going in the transport ship. Sir Loran will pilot, as always. We best make for the docking chamber.” Her mother stood and Aderyn rose after her, frowning. Something felt out of place, but she had no idea what it could be. Just when she was about to ask again, her mother turned and regarded her with a serious expression. Those gray eyes were cold and hard. They made Aderyn feel five years old and stripped naked.

“This will be your first war. I’ve not allowed you to see others but I’m afraid that your unwillingness to Spark has forced me to take you out in public regardless. You must be perfect. Despite our best gene therapy you did not turn out as beautiful as you should have so you will have to be charming.”

Each word felt like a nail being hammered into her heart. They stung and she struggled to remain composed. Crying now would make her mother exasperated and there was no telling how badly that would go. She swallowed her pain, forced it way down inside with the shame of her Null-Blood and kept her face smooth and stoic. Perhaps if she showed poise, her mother would at least be proud of that.

“Do you know why I impress this upon you?”

“Yes, mother. Because I am a Null.”

Her mother looked sharply to the door and then back. “Do not say that so loud. It’s bad enough you must cover your back without announcing to those who can’t see you.” Aderyn refrained from mentioning that everyone in the Starkeep was well aware of her condition by now, but simply looked down in mock shame. “I’m sorry mother, please tell me.”

“I know about your… interest in the Groundlings. I have heard you asking about them to your brothers and don’t think I’ve forgotten that ridiculous request for a Groundling maid. Horror! Now listen to me. This war is important to us and to you. So I do not want to see you cringing or protesting when Groundlings are killed. This is a war. That is what they are for. Do you understand?”

The shame was hard to hide now. Her face colored, deepening crimson at her cheeks and neck. Until that moment, Aderyn had not wanted to think about that part. She’d also hoped that her mother would have forgotten about the maid request. So many are going to die… well, perhaps not so many this time? Perhaps it will be a short war. With this thought bolstering her, she raised her head and nodded.

“I do, mother. I will not shame you.”

Without another word, her mother swept out of the room, white and yellow skirts swishing. Her bodice opened wide in the back, a scoop that dipped just below the small of her back. Plainly visible, her Spark brand glowed bright white. It was so bright that she could have lit up an entire room with it. Aderyn touched her own back, felt the smooth skin and closed her eyes. You must be perfect. The words nearly made her laugh. Nothing would ever be perfect in the eyes of Lyana Medani.

“Must I wait so long?”

I’m sorry, she thought before opening her eyes. “I’m coming mother.” And then, she went to join her in the hall toward the docking quarters.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_18w0i1,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/18w0i1/the_blood_part_2_serialized_space_opera_novella/,

America’s Only History book. Period. Shut up. MacMillan Books, Lubbock, Texas.  (c) 2013

Back before the Civil War, there was a war with Mexico.  They had a huge army backed by the imperialistic might of the Spanish empire.  It all started when Mexico invaded the city of El Alamo.  Luckily, Davy Crockett, Daniel Boon, Sam Houston, Ronald Reagan and Jesus were there to kill the Mexicans.  They were driven across the Rio Grande, and the war was over.  Crockett, Boon and Houston built a wall between the border of the United States and Mexico and Jesus teleported to Mexico City, which he burned to the ground.  Shortly after, an evil army of liberals led by Barack Mohammed Hussein bin-Obama tore the wall down and invited all 100 million Mexicans to steal the 2008 election for him.  They also stole everyone’s jobs.

This is the true story of America that the government doesn’t want you to know about.

The American Revolution

One Thursday afternoon before July 4, 1776 a bunch of guys in Boston threw a bunch of British tea into the water because they didn’t want to pay taxes.  They also refused to drink coffee, which is why this was such a big deal.  Everyone in Texas at this time was drinking coffee, so they didn’t have this problem.  Until recently, everyone was really confused why tea was such a big deal. Historians still don’t quite understand why Bostonians were so pissed about tea.  The leading theory is that they were very drunk after a St. Patrick’s Day parade and needed to destroy something.  Others postulate that legal gay marriage in the Massachusetts Colony caused God to infect the citizen’s brains with a parasitic worm.  However, all historians agree that if Bostonians had just drank coffee, war could have been avoided.

The British got really mad that all that tea got wasted.  So they sent a lot of Red Coats to live with Bostonians and keep them out of trouble. Remember that from John Adams on HBO? Man, that shit was intense.  There was that intense music and slow motion of women getting rifle-butted by Red Coats.  Didn’t happen.  But now it did cause it’s in this textbook! Hah! Suck it.

Thomas Jefferson, who was living with all the Founding Fathers in Boston somewhere, was really pissed cause this cut deeply into his slave sex time.  Ashamed to sleep with his slaves in front of strangers, Jefferson was forced to have sex with his actual wife.  This pissed him off terribly. He fled Boston to Virginia where he stayed until he died, having done absolutely nothing of importance for the rest of American History.  For some reason he was elected Second President of the United States and for this he was put on the $2 bill.  Everyone knows if Texas was allowed to vote for the Second President of the United States, it definitely would not have been Jefferson.  Everyone thought Jefferson sucked, so the U.S. Treasury stopped producing $2 bills.

Anyways, so while writing the U.S. Declaration of Independence and Constitution, Jesus was also farming a lot of cattle.  He was the best cattle-wrangler in all of Lubbock, which he occasionally would teleport to.  You know what, no. He was in both places at once.  He was in Philly writing the Declaration of U.S.A. Patriotism Constitution and roping cattle at the same time.  Anyone who says different is an atheist and doesn’t get to vote.  There, that’s settled.  Even blacks, with 3/5 of a human vote will have more votes than atheists because we beat and raped the tribal African religions out of them. It’s called civilization.  Deal with it.

So where was I?

The United States of America and the Independent Country of Texas totally kicked British ass for, like, 5 years or something like that. The French, who like all civilized people really hate the English, wanted to join the war.  America was initially hesitant about being helped by a communist country, but decided that any enemy of my enemy is my… wait.  No… what is it? You fool me twice, shame on you… You can’t fool me is what I’m getting at here. I guess…

So the French sent over their most fearsome baguette bakers and Panini pressers.  Sadly, they were all annihilated by a vengeful army of frogs at the Battle of New Orleans.  Having lost their Middle Class, France’s political structure crumbled.  But, they saw how awesome America was at kicking ass and decided to have a revolution to try and be like the United States.  This was never successful because France is full of fags.

…

England totally lost.  They were injured.  Real injured.  Since Jesus was totally pissed that England attacked the United States in the first place, he infected all the English with poor dental hygiene and syphilis.  This is, of course, until Margaret Thatcher started hanging faggots in Trafalgar Square – it’s like their Times Square – which pleased Jesus, who then told Ronald Reagan that it was OK to forgive them.

Now that America won, they could write their Bill of Rights.  Jesus told George Washington and John Adams that only Christians (preferably white Protestants – Yeah! I’m talking to you Kennedy!) could be President.  This is why when Barack Hitler Mohammed Hussein bin-Laden Obama stole the election in 2008, Jesus forsake the United States and caused the economy to collapse until the Republican party could win it back from the evil Muslim Kenyan/Hawaiian/Indonesian.

George Washington and John Adams liked to hunt.  A lot.  Let me put it this way.  Have you ever been inside a Longhorn Steakhouse? Or I mean, pretty much any steakhouse.  Yeah, that’s what their house looked like.  Here’s an anecdote (it means a short personal story) about it: One day, feeling particularly patriotic, John Adams walked outside his front door and grabbed a mountain lion by the throat and nailed it to a frame on his wall while it tried to claw his face off.  He then took a shit comprised mainly of nails and razor wire.

Jesus also told the Founding Fathers that they had to accomplish a couple of things in securing basic liberties for the people of this new country.

1. No queers.

2. Only white men can vote.

3. You can say whatever you want unless it offends Christians.

4. The official religion of the United States is Christianity (again, preferably Protestants – Do I      have to come over there Kennedy? I swear.)

5. If you don’t have a gun, you can’t vote.

6) Taxes are really bad unless they are spent in your state.  Only your representative does a       good job, it’s other people who are electing assholes.

7. Public Education is a sin.  Reading this textbook right now is a sin.  Close your eyes.  Stop it!     Oh man, you are totally going to hell right now.  You better feel real guilty about reading this.

8. The States are basically their own countries.  The government in Washington is really only       legitimate when controlled by whichever political party you like.

9. It’s a moral imperative to kick the shit out of whichever country looks at you wrong.  Especially if they have a lot of brown people and no standing army.

Having established a country for his future resurrection place (or whatever the hell it is that Mormon’s believe), Jesus was free to rest. He ventured to a cave somewhere mysterious – who’re we kidding, it was in Texas – and slumbered until the day when humanity would need him again.  The Founding Father’s finished the Constitution, which is totally specific about everything and needn’t be interpreted by anyone!  Then, they too, joined Jesus in a cave – isn’t the Whispering Caves in Texas? Whatever. it is now.  This is a textbook.  You’re fucked if you think those caves are in New Mexico or something.  This textbook says the Whispering Caves are in Texas. Students are totally citing this shit in their research papers.  Ha! Just kidding!  People in Texas don’t write.  Or read.

I spent most of the afternoon sketching it out and editing various ideas, and I don't know how to end it or if it's even worth extrapolating in to a larger story. The prose section in the middle is a paragraph that popped in to my head while I was outlining. It might go in the first draft depending on whether or not I decide to pursue writing this. I just wanted to know what you all think of the bare bones story as it is. 

-In the beginning of Fall, a 17 year old high school student named Jesse gets sentenced to 100 hours of community service after spray painting a stencil on to a building

-He's a really straight-laced guy, never even gotten a speeding ticket, pretty quiet in school

-He spray painted the building on an impulse after realizing that he had never done anything even slightly rebellious in his life

-The community service he's assigned is the rennovation and upkeep of an old house whose owner died recently, his classmates have told him that the house is haunted by the spirit of the old lady who died there

-One of his friends tells him that he actually went there one night and had stuff thrown at him by a ghost

-Ownership is passed to the city as stated in the deceased woman's will, and they plan on turning it in to a museaum

-Jesse is told to mow the lawns regularly, paint the inside of the house, and gut the kitcken to prepare for a professional rennovation team

-Due to his completely uncriminal past he is left to work alone, with a threat of prison time if he doesn't finish his work to keep him accountable

-On his first day he begins by mowing the lawn, only to have a rock thrown at him by something inside the house

-Jesse looks up after the rock is thrown and catches a glimpse of a person ducking down under a window

-He begins to get scared and believe the stories that his friends were telling him about the house being haunted

-He comes in the next day early and finds a girl sitting on the porch, waiting for him

-She's rail-thin, has short, bright colored hair, and generally looks like the kind of person who would live in an abandoned house

-She tosses the remains of a soda can at him, which he dodges

-He angrily asks her what she's doing there, and if she's the one who threw the rock yesterday

-The girl looks surprised, but regains her composure enough to tell him that she lives there

-The have a conversation about whose house it actually is, and he agrees to let her stay there as long as she doesn't screw up any of his work, and makes sure she's gone by the time he finishes his 100 hours

-She agrees, but he can tell that she's going to be trouble in the future

-For the rest of the day she doesn't show her face, and when Jesse comes back the next morning he finds himself hoping that he scared her off

-Later on, while he's painting the hallway the girl runs down the stairs, spray paints a few lines on the fresh paint he'd just laid down, and runs down to the basement

-Jesse gets mad and yells at her from the hallway, but he's not upset enough to chase her and abandon his work

-That night before he leaves he goes down to the basement to tell her she needs to leave

-He finds her sitting on a couch, reading

-She has a small, furnished space that looks well lived in, and he loses his nerve

-Obviously the girl has nowhere else to go, and he doesn't feel like kicking her out

-Instead, he tells her ""goodnight"" and walks back up the stairs

-She smiles, and says ""goodnight"" to him, before he heads home

-Over the course of the week Jesse gets to know the girl better through conversations they have while he's working

-Her name is Molly, and she used to go to the same high school as him before she stopped attending

-She's been living in different places around the city for about a year, and had settled in the house just after the owner died

-She continues to harass him and interrupt his work by throwing things around and painting over the walls

-At one point she shows up with a guitar and plays for Jesse while he's painting

-He's surprised at how talented she is, and even sings along to some of the songs she plays

-They get gradually more and more comfortable around each other, and even though her harassment grows gradually more playful and less malicious, she still keeps her distance and is quite insulting towards him some days

-Despite her rough demeanor, and the fact that she won't let him work in peace most of the time, Jesse is grateful for the company and eventually starts to develope feelings for her

-One day she actually helps him with his work, and they get most of the kitchen demolished and most of the debris hauled out to a dumpster

-After working almost the whole day through, she leads him upstairs and out a window on to the roof where they sit and talk while the sun is setting

-That night, against all of his better judgement, Jesse falls hopelessly in love with Molly

-He tells her ""goodnight"", walks back home, and spends a sleepless night wondering whether or not he should tell her how he feels

-He resolves to tell Molly the truth, but returns the next day to find most of her stuff cleared out of the basement and no sign of her in the house

""She was achingly beautiful. She was wonderfully, mysteriously, alarmingly beautiful. Despite her loud, rebellious, condescending nature, or perhaps even because of it, Jesse had sunk in to a hopeless, deep love for her. Maybe, he thought to himself, some of her rebellion had settled somewhere deep in his bones, because in that moment he resolved to strike out against every sound scrap of advice that had ever been passed his way and tell this girl exactly what he thought of her. So, for the first time in his life, Jesse decided to listen to his heart instead of his head, whatever consequences that might bring.""

-He skips work that day and searches all over town for her, and eventually finds her sitting on a dock by the ocean

-He sits down next to her and asks why she left, Molly doesn't reply but starts crying instead

-She gets up and starts walking away, in an attempt to stop her Jesse grabs her shoulder and his hand goes straight through her body

-Jesse stumbles backward in shock and almost falls in to the water, but manages to steady himself

-He demands an explanation from Molly, who stops crying long enough to clear the situation up

-Molly tells him that she died 55 weeks ago of bone cancer

-She tells him that although she can interact with physical things, she can't touch humans or animals and no one has been able to see her until he showed up

-He asks why she left so suddenly, and she admits that she had started falling in love with him as well

-She thought that leaving before he knew the truth about her was the best way to handle the situation

-She tells him that she was extremely thankful for his company, but knew that he would eventually figure out what she was and leave her 

-They sit on the dock for a while in silence before he offers to walk her back to the house, which is nearly finished by now

-The spend the night there playing music, talking, and trying not to think about where their relationship is heading

-She eventually tells him about her life before she died

-She was born in to a rich family, but hated wealth and preferred to spend time with her poor friends in run down parts of the city

-A year and a half before she died, she ran away from home for good at 17 years old

-After a year of living around the city she started experiencing horrible pain in her left leg, and went to a hospital where a surgeon her dad knew let her stay

-He diagnosed her with bone cancer in her left femur, and called her parents to let them know where she was staying

-For six months after the diagnosis the doctors tried everything from surgery to chemotherapy, but nothing was able to stop the malignant tumor

-And so, almost a year before she and Jesse met, she died and was buried in her family's cemetary

-Jesse is overwhelmed at this point, and can do nothing but sit in silence with Molly

Layla’s room was what every little girl wanted, filled with stuffed animals
 and soft blankets. But there weren’t any pink walls. All the walls were sky
 blue. One even had an underwater castle with fish swimming around it.
Layle perked up in bed while she waited for her parents to come tuck her in. 
The nightly routine was never broken, ever. 

“What book do you want tonight?” her mother's sweet, but toned down, 
southern accent asked before ever stepping foot in the door. 

""The fishie book!” she called back.

Her parents came through the door. First her mother, who was already in
her comfy clothes, as she called them, followed by her father.  A few of Layla’s
 friends told her that they were afraid of her dad. But she couldn’t understand why,
 because to her he was the funny man who made voices while her mom read stories, 
making them last longer than they should.  One friend told her that her daddy had 
a deep scary voice that was as loud as thunder. 

“Little one, you have a hundred books on fishies. You have to pick one.” Her father
 fixed his glasses on his face.

“Oh Charles you know which one she is talking about.”  Mother plucked a book 
with duct tape holding the spine together from the shelf above the bed.

“Right.” He settled in next to Layla. “The fishie book.”

It didn’t matter that, as her parents read, Layla would read right along with them.
The book’s pages were yellowed from age. It was her mother’s book from when
she was Layla’s age. The artwork didn’t look like Layla’s Disney books. They were 
different. She asked her mother if they were painted, but there was no way to really 
know. With the last page coming up, Layla fought back her yawns. She was a big girl
now. Six years old. She could stay up through the fishie book.

Her father tucked her in with the last word of the story. He didn’t need to see the text
any more than she did. With a kiss from both parents placed on her forehead, she was
almost in dream land.  Her mother give her the final bit of the recipe, the click of her
otter night-light.  Knowing that the glow from the silly little otter was helping to keep 
the monsters away, Layla knew it was okay to let her heavy lids finally come down. 

Sometime during the night, a storm must have come through because that could
be the only reason why her otter would be off. Layla listened to be sure no monster 
was in the room. As she listened, her eyes adjusted. Even though she hadn’t heard any 
monster, she was so scared to get out of bed.  Taking a big breath, she placed one foot 
on the rug. Nothing happened. Good, now it was time for the other. Layla made her way 
by moonlight across the room. When she clicked the switch on the lamp just liked her mom 
did, nothing happened.  Layla found where the plug was and it was plugged in. At this point 
she didn’t know what to do, but she wasn’t going to be able to sleep in the dark.

Layla didn’t want her parents to think she was still a baby. Mommy just started letting 
her watch scary movies with daddy and she said if she started having nightmares there 
would be no more scary movies. After a moment, Layla knew she had to wake her mom. 
Tip toeing down the hall, Layla made her way to her parents’ door. At first, she knocked 
with just her the nail of her finger. Her mother was always a light sleeper and usually 
woke when Layla opened her door, but this time, nothing. 

“Mommy?” Layla whispered.

When she went to turn the knob, she found that it was open, so she gave it a gentle push. 
The bathroom light to the left of the bed was on and gave off enough light to see her 
parents both in bed. Just as she was about to wiggle her way through the door, she stopped. There was someone else in the room. 

“Don’t see me, don’t see me, don’t see me.” Layla couldn’t stop the pleas from escaping her. 

Layla quickly ran back down the hall to her room. She shut the door and locked it.
Her mom said if a monster was ever in the house, she was to go into her closet and 
hide there. She did her best to do what her daddy had shown her and barely moved 
the stack of blankets out of the way to expose the little door. She slipped in and waited for morning. 

When the birds started to chirp, Layla crept out from her hiding place. If the sun was up, 
it meant it was safe. The monster never came to her room last night. Maybe it was all 
made up in her head. She wasn’t going to tell her mom, but she was right. She wasn’t 
big enough for the scary movies. That had to be it, it was just a figment of her imagination. 
Layla wasn’t sure what that meant but she heard her father say it a few times. 

When her tummy started to rumble Layla couldn’t believe her mom hadn’t come 
to get her yet. It’s not like she needed to be told to get up, but her mom still did 
it every morning by tickling her till she thought she would pee. The hall was a lot 
less scary with the bright sun pouring in through the windows.

Her parents’ door was wide open. That made Layla smile and skip all the way into 
the room. She saw her mommy sleeping in bed but her dad was nowhere to be seen. 
But it didn’t matter anyways since Daddy wasn’t very good at making Mickey Mouse pancakes. 

“Mommy, I’m hungry.” Layla didn’t need to whisper anymore. There were no 
monster and it was way past the time for Mommy to be up.

But nothing came from her. When Layla wiggled her arm like a jelly worm and still 
her mother did not stir, Layla climbed into bed and looked at her mom. She was so pretty. 
Even when she slept she was pretty. Layla got real close and opened one of her mother’s eyes. 
It was a lot harder than it usually was. 

“Mommy you’re sleeping too much.” There was still no answer. “Fine! I’m going 
to ask daddy to make me pancakes.”

Layla stormed out of the bedroom and into the kitchen. But her father wasn’t there. 
She saw his keys and wallet in their basket so he had to be here somewhere. After 
looking basically everywhere, she plopped down on the couch and started to watch 
cartoons. Before a whole show was over, her tummy rumbled again.

Layla went out front to see if she missed her dad. Sometimes he worked on his car 
and would hide under it. He said it was his secret place from Mommy. And she didn’t 
check there last time, so that had to be it. After looking under the car and not finding him anywhere, Layla sat at the end of the driveway. Maybe he went with a friend somewhere.

“Layla?” a woman’s voice called from across the street.

“Hi Miss Rachel!” Layla sprung to her feet and blotted to her neighbors yard.

“What are you doing outside?” Rachel was young, about 25, and looked different from mommy. She had long brown hair that looked like it was painted like a tiger with red stripes.
 
“I was looking for my daddy but I can’t find him. Could you make me pancakes?” The little girl squinted from the sun as she looked up.

“Layla where’re your parents?” Rachel wasn’t sure if it was the sound coming from Layla’s stomach or the fact that it was Tuesday and she wasn’t in school, but something wasn’t right. 

“My mom is sleeping and I don’t know where dad is. But I’m really hungry. Do you have any cookies?” Layla put her hand on her stomach. It was starting to hurt.

“Let me go grab my phone and we’ll see about waking up your mom.” Rachel grabbed her phone and her pepper spray. She didn’t know what to expect but that was about the only thing she had to defend herself if anything went down.

Layla led the way in the house. Rachel knew it well. She had been babysitting for Layla since she was born. Everywhere she looked, everything seemed to be in place. As they went down the hall, Rachel noticed the office door was open, and it’s never open. The office always stayed locked.

“And then I saw a monster in mommy’s room last night so I hid in my little room.” Layla broke Rachel’s investigator mood.

She stopped dead in her tracks. “Layla what did the monster look like?” 

“Oh, like a man, but he was all black. It’s okay, I’ve seen them in movies and they can’t be outside when the sun is up.” The little girl made her way into her mom’s room. “Moooooom, you have to get up. I see your eye is open.”

Rachel was shaking. There was a pool of blood on the floor below the dangling arm. And Layla was right, her eye was open. Rachel didn’t need to look anymore. The woman was dead and this little girl had spent the day with a dead body and didn’t know it. She didn’t want to alarm her, so when she called the police, Rachel made sure to do it in another room.

The doorbell rang and Layla beat Rachel to the door. “Hi! Are you friends with my dad?” 

The police officer smiled down at her. But when he looked up at Rachel, he knew it was about to be a long night. “No, I’m here to see your mommy.”

“Well, good luck. She’s been sleeping all day.” Layla didn’t care anymore about the new person, her cartoon was on and there was no way she was going to miss it.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1343361254.0,,,True,t3_x8ahm,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/x8ahm/draft_of_the_1st_chapter_of_somewhere_across_the/,

Every inch of the room was spotless, from the tops of the headboards to the cracks in the floorboards. The early hours of her morning had been a vigorous cleaning regimen, but she was certain that if she didn’t do it, no one else would.

Stretching quietly, she glanced over to where Gabriel lay. He had such an air of peace about him that she couldn’t help but try not to disturb it. Stepping softly into the hall, she made her way to the bathroom; all of the work she had put into cleaning would be for naught if she didn’t shower and get out of her dirty clothes. Trying her absolute best not to make a sound, she slipped down the hallway, hardly sparing a glance towards the shadowy frames hidden in the early morning light: family photos of Gabriel and his children, Gabriel’s parents on their wedding day, his ten-year-old son at little league, his five-year-old daughter in her mother’s arms, and other things of that nature. Ignoring these almost guilt inducing images, she entered the bathroom, washed her hands, and then quietly shut the door behind her.

Moving over to the bathtub, she exhaled exhaustedly and fiddled with the water until it was the right temperature. Then, after starting up the shower, she shut the curtain and turned around to face the cabinet. She opened the top door, knowing full well that she would find clean towels in there, since she had just put them away herself before Gabriel had gotten home. Choosing one of the older ones, she slipped her clothes off and wrapped them in it, then, selecting another, nicer towel, she lay it on the sink and stepped into the shower.

She hadn’t anticipated how incredibly soothing the water would be; it pooled under her feet, slightly discolored from the dirt and grime. Leaning her head back, she closed her eyes, allowing the water to soak her hair and run over her body in its entirety. She didn’t bother with shampoo or body wash, she just wanted to rinse off the worst of the mess.

Stepping out of the shower, she wrapped the clean towel around her and dashed out to her car, hoping there was a change of clothes. To her relief, she found a dress under the backseat and threw it on, leaving the wet towel on the front seat of the blue Bug. Then, as quickly as she could in the growing light of dawn, she ran back inside, grabbed the towel with her dirty clothes in it, found her purse, and ran back out to her car. Slipping the key in the ignition, she quietly left the house as it was.

She drove in silence the twenty miles or so to her house and parked off to the side of her driveway. Her parents hadn’t come home from her aunt’s house yet, thankfully, so there was no worry of waking them. Locking her front door behind her, she threw the dirty clothes and towels into the washing machine along with whatever else was in her basket, then went upstairs and fell into bed.

*So, I have quite a few ideas for where this might go and I have a little bit written after this...but honestly, writing really is something I absolutely love and would love to do professionally. Except, I'm really self-conscious and never have the confidence to follow through with a project. I just...would like an opinion from someone other than my extremely supportive boyfriend. :) Please? And thanks in advance!*

He grimaced, and angrily grabbed his sharpener. Damn girls, he thought. This one in particular had been stalking him for the last week.

William carefully ground the tip back to a point, ignoring the bleach-blonde girl who had sat down at his table. The lunch room around him was fairly loud, and he had just been able to focus on his music and his work when she had rudely interrupted him. “So…” she said, like he was about to say something. He lightly blew the dust of the page, and eyed it to judge whether it was fixable. “Wow you’re really good.” she said.

“Well,” he growled as he realized that, sadly, it had smudged enough to make an eraser necessary, “I was certainly better a few minutes ago.” She was obviously hurt, and he didn’t care. She was only putting on a show, anyways. “Well fine then,” she said. “You're missing out.”

Good, William thought as he turned open a new page and started the preliminary out lines of a figure in motion. At least he could now rest in peace, though the entire room was staring/glaring because of her out burst.

In grey-scale, lightly smudged, a girl dances across the page. A light shadow is cast on her bare back, making it pop off the otherwise blank page. She’s facing away from the viewer, with her hips swayed and her arms above her, tilted with her head. A flowered, flowing skirt whirls around her, as if she is coming off of a spinning turn. It seems so life-like; every flower is singularly done, every momentary ruffle captured in the charcoal. William looked back contentedly at his work, now in his dorm room. She seemed so beautiful- the girl from his dreams, the one whose face he never saw, but who he had come to love.

He touched the whirling hair, each strand individually drawn, and then ripped the page from his book and placed it gently on the table. Then he carelessly crushed it, crumpled it up, and threw it away into a trashcan filled with similarly crushed papers. It still didn’t look quite like her. It wasn’t quite perfect- as if he was forgetting one important detail.

Sighing, he turned out his bedside lamp, ready to sleep once again. Maybe he would see her dance again.

Maybe he would remember the detail this time.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_uvaur,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/uvaur/dancer_very_short_less_a_story_and_more_a_snapshot/,

",brownsound44,3,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/tx9lq/first_story_empathy_about_1200_words/,"A storm is brewing.


	Endless slate grey clouds roll across the sky like a lazy carpet being unfurled 
into the horizon. Trees are dancing in the wind, and fallen, browning leaves pick 
themselves up off the ground to swirl in eloquent spirals for precious seconds 
before sadly resigning themselves to gravity. Chaotic clouds of dust slowly rise from 
nothingness and chase sparse cars that occasionally lurch by, slowly fading to hazy 
grey outlines and then eventually disappearing altogether. All movement is 
lethargic; the damp pathos permeating through the panorama has filled all empty 
space with viscous, resistant ether. J pushes through the dense air and carefully 
steps onto the concrete curb with a calculated leap, making sure not to land on the 
lines dividing the slabs of stone laid out in front of him. He had the habit of testing 
himself like that every so often. When he was younger he would force himself to 
skip every second step while climbing staircases, and would diligently avoid falling 
prey to the universe by never missing a beat. That was a long time ago though, it
seemed like decades to J, who now silently stops and takes in the atmosphere, 
releasing it in a long, melancholic sigh. 

	Floating through a crack in the present, a wispy memory makes brief contact 
with J, warming his insides like a cup of winter morning tea. His face stretched into a
 crooked smile as he walked down the isolated sidewalk, bare branches barely 
brushing his forehead. The scene is familiar: laid before his eyes was the standard
 seven-minute post-school stroll back home that J had conquered everyday for the
 past eight years – the same walk during which the elusive answers to the universe’s
 many mysteries had been hunted down by his self-appointed ‘enlightened mind’. It 
is fascinating, the amount of aimless exploration possible in the span of a kilometer, 
meaning, meaning, meaning – where is it? As usual, spatial familiarity brought a 
greasy, fattening and very temporary comfort to J’s troubled soul; he recognized the
 thin, aging trees, the number of strides required to walk from one to the next, and 
counted under crumbly breath as he ambles along. He recognized the message of the
 harsh blue-and-yellow banner that hangs loosely off the southern wall of that huge, 
brown warehouse – whose unused chimneys had been reaching for the skies in 
unquenched desperation for years. The sign is populated by splashes of colour and
 large blocked letters that occasionally arrange themselves to spell out product 
pushing pleas. 

	J stood aside in an attempt to acknowledge the beauty in that 
monochromatic, glassy urban landscape spread before him, while his mind began to
 wander like a confused old man meandering about an open field. Sporadic gusts of 
wind kissed the side of J’s youthful face and caressed his jet-black hair like a 
concerned lover. There was a romance in the world yet – one of the few remaining
 ideals J’s deep-rooted cynicism had not managed to squash. “Nice”, he mumbled, 
maintaining that self-conscious smile; he wouldn’t want to seem like he was talking
 to himself even though there was no one around, someone could always be 
watching from an anonymous window. I guess one could call him happy for those few fleeting seconds.

	The breeze swaggered in drawn out ellipses over the trash covered sidewalk,
 disturbing a myriad of multi-coloured plastic bags that rocked irritably like sleeping 
children shaking off attempts at being coerced into brassy consciousness. J stopped walking and stared on. 

	



					SNAP! 



	A particularly plain and achromatic bag was suddenly jerked skyward, 
wrenching J from his lofty plane of thought. It took him a second to adjust to this 
unexpected animation; he was suddenly present in the here and the now, aware and 
alert. He noticed that the floating piece of trash was now ballooning under the strain 
of Mother Nature, following invisible clotheslines in parallel sprints of arbitrarily 
increasing and decreasing altitude, lingering just a few feet above his head until 
laconic crosswinds finally brought the bag to a constant tumble. Thrown into life, 
the poor thing had no idea what to do, and obeyed Years Of Determinism with 
devout reverence. Strict and unwaveringly impersonal, this birthing method 
involved experiencing all through experiencing that-which-cannot-be-experienced. J 
nodded in acknowledgment, he was yet to be reborn. 

	Eyes followed conscientiously. Beautiful. A raw spectacle; forces of the 
universe suppressing, opposing that which man works so hard to create; a symbol of 
our subordination to the powers that really be. J shuddered uncontrollably as waves 
of silent goose bumps rolled over his shaking arms. The spectacle was too much for 
him; he stood at absolute attention, fixated on that honest violence that so 
entranced him. The bag was enraptured by its newfound life, and shyly led J’s eager 
mind into a voiceless conversation. He looked down, embarrassed. What was he 
thinking? J had places to go, social situations to avoid, he did not have the time to 
converse with any sentient Plastic Bags; but then again, who did?

	Alone and frightened, Plastic Bag did not even attempt to steady herself as 
the atmospheric tides pulled her out to a heavenly sea. Scattered beams of dull light 
filtered through her translucent body, whose keen angles sparkled in frenzied 
delight when touched by the comforting glow. She was still talking, something about 
how it was nice to meet J, who was still too floored to reply. He lifted a limp hand as 
a sort of haphazard greeting, not really sure how one greets a floating piece of 
plastic. 
	A quick gust of wing twisted up through the isosceles triangle formed where 
J’s legs met the cold concrete surface that supported them. Bag was subsequently
 greeted by a few more flying playfellows, who had been thrown up by this infinitely 
regressed gust of wind. They all unabashedly joined her in a coordinated celebration 
of existence. The violence drew in more crowds of discarded signs of life, killers, 
hospital-bombers, rioters, deviants and lovers; they all held hands and sang songs of 
praise, all the while screaming in muted agony. Time slowed down…

	J stepped back in surprise when he heard the soft splash near his feet. An
 unfamiliar wetness cradled his lower eyelids. Why was he crying? It had been years 
since he had last cried, or felt any emotion for that matter. Apathy had become that 
wise old bastard in his youthful head, distributing sage indifference like a basket of 
free lollipops in a hospital waiting room. Having wiped his tears, J was left standing 
with nothing but inward passions and a wet sleeve; what was he thinking? A page of 
the day’s newspaper twirled in slow ecstasy as it floated by, waving excitedly at J. J 
waved back and then quickly straightened himself, his eyes scanning the area 
nervously. He scratched his head, trying to sort out the flurry of emotions taking 
over him. J was alive and kicking, moving, learning, growing, not being pulled 
forward by an imaginary end, but rather pushing himself towards infinity. He was 
laughing and crying at the same time, his shoes melted away and the shirt on his 
back flaked off of him like snow off of a sloped rooftop. Those flakes never hit the 
ground, time slowed down,   slowed   down,     slowed      down,      

slowed                 down


Slowed

I'm pretty good at writing every day, just wanted to share this with you all:


You were having a lot of bad dreams.  Dreams where you’d murdered somebody and were plagued by guilt and fear that you would be caught and punished for your crimes.  You ran.  They caught you and punished you.  And then you woke up.  Repeat.

It had been happening for a while.  You wouldn’t remember it at first, but then while you were eating your morning bowl of Special-K it would suddenly all come back to you, and you would wonder to yourself “Did I really do that?” nearly endlessly before you finally decide that you didn’t.  Though the dream was so vivid, you can’t come up with any memory to suggest it could be true.   You calm then, and go back to eating your pretentious cereal.

Then one day you had a dream that you’d killed a teenage girl.  One who’d really been murdered when you were in junior high.  In the dream you strangled her in the alley between the block that divided your houses and left her there.  When you woke up that one bothered you more than the others, and you wondered if you needed help.  You knew you couldn’t have killed the girl, as her body wasn’t actually found in the alley but rather at a lake twenty miles away, and as you were a year younger than her and had neither access to a car nor the knowledge to operate one it was downright impossible that you could have done the deed.  While this knowledge helps relax you, you still think that the dreams are unhealthy.

So you grab a copy of the Yellow Pages from the stack that sits outside your apartment building until someone throws them away and find a shrink.  There are so many shrinks in the phonebook that you resort to finding the one with the classiest ad.  It takes a while to decide, but you finally settle on one Herbert Nettlemier, and call him on the cell phone you still suspect might be giving you cancer.  His dim receptionist answers and you set up an appointment in to days’ time.  Only after you make the appointment do you realize that you’ve never met a sane shrink.

Then you wait.  Each night you have another dream about murdering the girl, each one more graphic than the last.  By the time the morning of your appointment comes your hand is trembling slightly and you decide to skip breakfast, your appetite having pulled a Hoffa.

“It’s good to see you, Mr. Jacobs,” the receptionist you’d already spoken to (but are just meeting) says when you arrive at the appointment.  Formalities finished, she then hands you a stack of papers to fill out.  You briefly wonder why you fill out the same forms every time (even though they should have your information by now), and think about making a quip, but ultimately decide not to.

You finish the paperwork and are ushered back to an exam room to wait for your doctor who is perpetually late even though he won’t tolerate you being less than fifteen minutes early.  He’s even more later for the appointment than he usually is, to add insult to injury.

Still, you greet him in the formal manner and he gets down to shrinking your head.  Whatever he does doesn’t work, as once your appointment is done and he spits you out onto the sidewalk outside of the office you feel nothing but confused.

You walk around the block a few times, chiding yourself for wasting so much money on so much uselessness.  When you’re done regretting your decisions you head to your job.  You’re the boss thankfully, so you don’t have to answer any uncomfortable questions about your random break.  As you supervise the peons at work you feel a sudden hatred for them, but manage to fight it down.  That’s what you do, you manage.
	


Edit: just noticed I do go back and forth on the tense, not sure if it's my drunken brain screwing me or coming up with something artistic, probably the former (let's be honest.)  Either way I can't figure out how to change it at the moment in my inebriated state.  Also, I just found this subreddit and love it!  It's really inspiring to see other budding writers at work.  Expect to see my ugly mug in more days to come.

1335864902.0,3,self.KeepWriting,t1bki,A Fantasy Story Idea I've Been Working On... (Part One),Kupkin,5,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/t1bki/a_fantasy_story_idea_ive_been_working_on_part_one/,"Bear with me, because this is a rather long **summary of a story** (I had the idea to break it down into three books, much like the version Lord of the Rings most people are familiar with, which I was heavily inspired by) and not all of the details have come together yet.  I guess I decided to post it because I want some feed back on whether the idea itself is any good, and if I should keep going with it.

I also can't decide how I want to present it... as a first person narrative, with a framing device, or as a third party recounting details...  Nor can I decide if I want to start at the beginning of the story, or jump in to the middle and fill the reader in with flashbacks and dialog.  It's my first attempt at writing something so big, so I'm kind of stuck on how to do it.

The idea is as follows:

In the world of Fiya (which is similar to Earth during medieval times), there are two races of sentient beings: Humans and Immortal Elves.  

From the beginning of time, most Elves always considered themselves superior to humans; the were faster, strong, more moral and more civilized.  They also possessed the ability to draw energies from the earth and nature, harnessing them into magic that could be used for good, or for evil.

The Elves lived in the ""Shadow Forests"", shrouded in mystery and darkness, protected by ancient spells that kept anyone not of Elvish Blood from entering the forest.

As time drew on, some Elves became fascinated with their human neighbors, who were slowly building a civilization along the sea cliffs in the Kingdom known as Ren.  Some of the Elves even took human lovers, but it was the Elf Osiriana that defied convention by forsaking her immortal life for a human husband.

Osiriana had been promised to Shiv, who was a kind of Elvish Prince.  Breaking her betrothal to him deeply wounded his pride, and the seed of hatred for humans was planeted.

During this same time, some Elves had begun to teach a special group of humans, the Druids, about the Elvish art of ecomancing, or drawing power from the Earth.  Some of the Druids were content to study the magic's ""light side"", but some took it to a much darker place, in hopes of learner more powerful magic, and using it to control the Elves, and gain access to whatever ""riches"" they might be hiding in their forest.

Shiv had found another bride, Aurelia, who was a talented ecomancer, and considered by many to be one of the most beautiful Elves in all the realm... However, despite her intelligence and looks, Shiv didn't love her.  Their marriage was largely a show, all he wanted from her was an heir to secure his place on the throne instead of his brother.  Years rolled by, and they remained childless.

Osiriana, however, had given birth to a son.  No only did her son hold the distinction of being the only half-elf, half-human baby to have been born alive, he was also the only son of the Prince of Ren, meaning that one day he would be king. (Obviously -.-)

Shiv's rage was unmatched when he heard the news that the woman who had spurned him had bore a child, and he was still childless.  He abused Aurelia and berated her verbally for her inability to give him a son.

He sent Aurelia to the Shadow Towers, an abandon castle at the northern end of the forest.  He visited her periodically, for the sole purpose of trying to have a child, but otherwise, he paid no attention to her.

In Ren, war had broken out as some of the druids rebelled against their order, abusing dark and dangerous magic, laying waste to the city.

Sirian, the father of Osiriana, begged and pleaded with Shiv for help, but Shiv responded that he felt the humans were getting what they deserved for meddling in powers they should not have.  Desperate to save his child, Sirian journeyed to the Shadow Towers and implored Aurelia to do something.

Aurelia was allowed a small personal guard and a few other attendants at the Shadow Tower.  Among her guard was Galle, a fierce warrioress, Loth, a powerful ecomancer, and Ru, her priest.  The four of them decided they would travel to Ren and try to aid the people in controlling the druids.

By the time they arrived, most of the kingdom was in ruins.  The Druids seemed to grow more powerful with every moment.

Distraught and deeply saddened by the death and destruction, Aurelia was at a loss.  She turned to her priest for council, but he had none to give her.  Galle, too, had no advice.  Finally, Loth spoke of an ancient magic, banned by the High Elvish council. It was volatile and dangerous, but if the rites were performed correctly, it would seal the druids in a tomb protected by a powerful magic.  It was blood magic.

Aurelia hesitated, but at Loth's urging, she decided it must be done.  They lured the druids to the barren wastes beyond Ren's borders, and Aurelia cut her hand, using her own blood for the ritual.  The druids were imprisoned, their souls cut off from their bodies, and locked in a tortured nothingness for all time.

As she returned to the Shadow Tower, she was met with the news that Osiriana had not survived, but that her son lived on.  She was also met with Shiv's fury.  He warned her if she ever defied him again, he would kill her.  Galle stepped in, swearing that if he did, she would kill him.  Disgusted, Shiv left, but not before forbidding Aurelia to ever leave the Shadow Tower again.

It should have saddened, but her had brought peace to the world... and it would stay that way for a thousand years.

Until a young prince of Ren entered the forest...

Prologue

It was storming out; an awful storm, one with flashing lighting and pounding thunder. Everyone rushed from their cars and into their warm homes to be greeted with open arms by their families. Everyone . . . but me. I stood beneath a tree, trying to stay dry while looking upon a house with sad eyes, wishing I had a family of my own to return to. As far as I knew however, I didn’t. Unfortunately I was not a lucky one. All that I did know was my name, Kimi.
	Unconsciously, I brushed the necklace that hung delicately around my neck. Crafted in a material that was unknown to me, was my name. I’d had it for as long as I could remember. Growing up in foster homes, it was the only link I had left of my original life. When I was five, I was found wondering the streets in torn, dirty, and burnt clothing. I looked as if I had been sent through a burning building and back. At the time however there were no local fires and after a month no one had claimed me. Ever sense then I had been in and out of foster homes, living on the streets in between. That was back in 1805. Impossible right? Yeah, I thought so to.
	While my body stopped growing around age 20, I lived on. I wasn’t sure what was going on, all I knew was that whatever it was, was not normal. I learned right away that running was my only option. Occasionally it was safe enough for me to re-enter society as just another lost kid, but I only stayed long enough to get a few nights good sleep and meals and new clothes. Sometimes the families were nice and it would be hard to leave, but I knew deep down I couldn’t stay.
	Turning away from the house I put up my hood and walked deeper towards the center of town. This was my fourth night in this town, I honestly should have moved on by now but something was keeping me here. I learned long ago to trust my instincts, because when I didn’t people got hurt. I was tempted to get myself caught by the police, letting them take me to foster care again. It had been a few months sense I had a hot meal, good clothes, hell even a hot shower would feel amazing. But something happened, something terrible, which made it so I couldn’t show my face any more.
	Two weeks ago my left cheek and forehead started itching pretty bad. I thought at first that I had a run in with some poison ivy. But the strangest thing happened, after a miserable 24 hours of pain, burning, and itching it suddenly stopped. I brushed it off but I started getting looks by random strangers over the next few days. One old lady even cursed at me and started ranting on about stupid teenagers and tattoos. I rushed into a public washroom and there, plain as day on my face, was a tattoo. Five dots now lined the top of my left cheek and a snowflake like pattern adorned my forehead, like a bendi.  I tried to take it in stride. I mean, what else could surprise me after being alive for the past two hundred years or so? Unfortunately I didn’t realize at the time how easily recognized I was now that this. . . thing, was permanently attached. Which brings me back to my current problem of leaving this town. 
	It was beautiful here; though I had no idea as to what ‘here’ was called, there were times, usually late into the night when I slept upon a pile of broken down boxes, that I came close to calling it home. But that was foolish was it not? What exactly was keeping me here? Was it the almost friendly neighborhood folks? Or was it the constant forest and wild life? I had no idea, but as I hurried through that pouring rain and under an overpass to wait it out i started to think. Why couldn’t this be home to me? What was stopping me from finding a semi safe tunnel and ‘building’ a home?
	As I slid down the overpass wall and curled into a tight ball to fight off the cold I knew I already had that answer. And it was simple.
	Fear.

He thought he would have gotten used to it after three months, but it has always reminded him of a pig being dragged to the slaughterhouse, squealing for mercy. Pete turned off the register and gathered up his things, forcing a crooked smile for his last customer who was carefully placing her bounty into an oversized handbag. She had waddled up to his register and dropped two cheesy romance novels in front of Pete, the kind that made him cringe. Pete just sat behind the counter and stared at the ground when she scolded him for trying to make her buy a magazine subscription; he thought working at a book store would be good for someone who enjoyed books as much as he. Instead, Pete found himself awkwardly thrusting subscriptions at customers in order to meet his monthly quota and dealing with exaggerated complaints. Nodding to the girl at the other register, he swiftly made his way to the exit.

Snow was lightly falling onto the dirty street outside; Pete pulled the hood up on his jacket as he started walking. He hated Pittsburgh in November. Winter always came early and the snow always seemed to be as grey as the city it covered. Back when he started at Pitt, he would take long walks at night just to be in the snow, counting out all the winters he had gone without snow living in Tennessee, brushing the brilliant white dust off his jacket. Now, he was no longer in school and hated the snow as much as everybody else in the city.

Two blocks down from the bookstore was Donni’s, a small, old-fashioned sandwich shop wedged between a large brown apartment complex and an even larger grey apartment complex. Pete had found the shop by chance after his second day of work at the store and made it a point to eat there a few times a week. Pete had concluded a while ago that the cook, Don, only owned one pair of clothes since he was always wearing the same dingy outfit. The food wasn’t great, but it was cheap and sometimes they brought a Rolling Rock over to his corner.

“On the house,” Don always said behind half-open eyes, as if it were a ritual he loathed but were somehow obligated to perform. Pete figured he was just being nice without actually trying to get to know him which was fine with Pete; he just wanted to relax after dealing with customers all day.

Pete walked in the sandwich shop and stomped his boots on the floor mat; the dining area was completely empty today, not unusual for the middle of the week as most people downtown preferred to have lunch at exactly noon.

The farm house was a simple affair with only two real rooms. Directly through the door was a small pantry that held hanging herbs and other things used for common poultices and potions. *That must have been where the smell came from*. His father had an herbalist and they made him keep his roots and plants in a building separate from main Hall. He glanced at the girl and paused her here. “Your grandmother was an herbalist?”

Tani would not look at him. “M’lord need not concern himself with that.” He frowned. Paul always despised it when people hid things from him. It made him feel like he wasn’t worthy of knowing it. His grip on her arm got tighter and she squirmed. “Tell me,” he insisted. She looked up at him, eyes suddenly fierce. Her jaw worked like she was chewing on her words. Finally she exhaled and looked away.

“Of a sort,” she said. There was a groan and she looked deeper into the house, reaching for the curtain that separated the pantry from the rest of the house. “Please, ask me later?” He nodded and they slipped through the curtain.

On the other side was an orderly chaos. Blankets, cooking ware, more herbs and feed were stored about the place in what seemed to be random piles against the wall. On closer inspection, Paul discovered they all contained the same items. It looked as though they were laid out for distribution.

There were four windows in the rooms that faced equally east and west and ran along the long side of the rectangular room. Hanging from exposed rafters were pheasants and ducks, waiting to be plucked and skinned. A blood cauldron was against one wall, one of the pheasants dripping its last remains from a torn neck. A black cat crossed through the sunlight that came through one of the windows, flicked its tail into the air and disappeared into the shadows.

In the back along a short wall, a drawn curtain separated a modest bed from the rest of the room. In the bed lay an old woman with hair as white as snow, skin as tough as leather and tanned to the color of dried wheat. There were great, purple spots on her cheeks and forehead. She was coughing into an old, stained cloth. “Tanielle,” she was calling out between coughs, waving a hand. “Tanielle bring me more milkweed, quickly now, the pain…”

The look of the old woman made Paul’s heart sink. He’d heard that cough and seen those spots before at Hallowed Hill. *We’d shut them all out, left them to die in the cellars. All those servants.* He felt suddenly sick. Having only been five then, Paul didn’t feel responsible but the memory made him remember the screams, the cries for help, the coughing. *The coughing never ended.*

“She has the Blood Plague,” he muttered, stopping the instant he knew it. Tani turned to look at him, having taken a step further. She raised a brow at him, then sucked on her lip. “I haven’t caught it. Neither will you.”

“I know,” he said. *That was mother’s gift to me.*

She went to the woman, fetched a pipe from a sack nearby the bed and pulled off a leafy root from the rafters. Using a small bladed knife she cut the leaves into small fragments and stuffed them into the bowl of the pipe.

“I know you,” the old woman suddenly croaked, pointing a gnarled finger in his direction. “The Hallowed Son. The raven with the inner eye.” Her mouth had only two teeth and her gums were running black from dried blood and milkweed. He felt his stomach twist. *Inner eye?*

“Nana,” Tani said as she came to her with the pipe. “Stop. Here, take this.”

The old woman reached up for the pipe and took it, placing the thin tube’s end in her mouth. She inhaled deeply and held it, laying back on the bed as she slowly exhaled the smoke from her lungs. “I knew your father,” the old woman said so softly that Paul had to strain to hear. He frowned. *How could this simple farm woman know my father?*

“How?” he blurted as Tani attempted to lead him away. “How do you know him?”

The old woman chuckled before a gurgling cough stopped her. It took nearly a minute for her to recover. In the meantime Tani again tried to pull him away but he stood where he was. The disease was almost forgotten now. “We should leave her, she’s… she’s not well,” Tani told him. “Let’s get you that bath.”

The old woman was trying to sit up but instead took another drag on the pipe when she found it too difficult. “Yes… Gareth Halloway, keeper of the noble bones. Yes… yes I know him.” She closed her eyes and Paul waited, Tani’s grip hard on his arm. “Pretty banners and shining armor, he rode this way often when he was young.”

“My father won this land from the Torley’s when he was not yet a man grown,” Paul said, feeling his cheeks flush. *And I ran from a battle when I* was *a man grown.* The old woman smiled and opened pale eyes towards him. “And then he went to lance a bear at his wedding and made a bed covering for his pretty new wife.” Paul nodded, having heard the tale a hundred times.

“Where did you meet him?” he asked, impatience in his voice. He wasn’t sure why he needed to know why this old woman knew his father. *Plenty of commoners knew his name. He’s a hero for bloody sake.*

“He did come here once,” she whispered, leaning up on her bony elbows and pointing the pipe at him. “Come drunk and looting,” she began but another coughing spell interrupted her. When she was done she took another long drag on the pipe. “Take what pleased him and his.”

“Nana,” Tani hissed. “Remember you should not talk when you are smoking that…”

The old woman smiled faintly and continued to look at Paul. He felt sick inside and also angry. *How dare this woman talk about my father like that.* Still that look she gave him was not mocking, nor was it accusing, it was a kind smile.

“I bandaged and touched up his scrapes. His men and horses too, me and my husband… Made to go the day after, having had our… our bread and water and made a mess of the house.” She was wheezing, her words interspersed with short, shaking breaths. Still her voice was kind, like she was breaking bad news to him gently.

“My husband asked for a small payment, for his lordship to please come take care of the bandits that come down from the Mossfield way. Your father he…” the old woman faltered then and closed her eyes, rubbing her forehead. Tani came to her then, easing her back onto the bed. “Rest nana, please. You’re weak and I need to take him for a bath, he’s requested it…” They spoke in hushed whispers then and Paul could no longer hear them. His thoughts swam as he leaned against the wall, a hand to his face. *My father stopped here? Why here of all bloody places? There’s nothing here!*

The old woman could say no more and so they went.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1k01wt,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1k01wt/feedback_hallow_hill_part_8_yet_more_target/,

So this is the void. Or death, perhaps.

I wonder if time’s passing. Maybe I’m just too used to ticking clocks. But there’s this longing in me that doesn’t seem to wear off — in fact it’s getting more and more unbearable with each moment that passes. How long a moment is, that I can’t answer.

I don’t know how long I’ve been here either, or even if there *is* a “here” where I can be.

All I know is that I can think.

Perhaps this is what I’ve always been, a stream of thoughts in the middle of nowhere. Nothing more than disembodied words adrift in the emptiness. It seems plausible.

No, no, it doesn’t. In that stream floats the idea that I’ve once been more than that. I can only wonder what or when. Probably a long time ago. If there is such a thing as time.

Wait, there’s more. Faint memories of things I’ve seen, of things I’ve done. Letters, words. A color.

No, the void is colorless.

The emptiness can’t be red.

My longing grows larger than the darkness. I *am* more than thoughts, I can… I can *feel.*

Pain. Cold. Paralysis. Ragged breathing.

Not death nor nothingness. Where am I?

“Now, now.” Not my voice. Or is it?

I try to speak. I can’t. I try to move. I can’t.

“He won’t wake up.” A woman’s voice.

“Hush, he’s coming to.”

Sound. Water dripping somewhere to my right.

Thirst. Sore throat, dry tongue. When I open my mouth, all that comes out is a faint croak.

“Hush! Let him.”

How can I be cold with a hot knife piercing through my side?

“Water.” It hurts too much to speak. I wonder if I can swallow. “Please… water.”

At first there’s no response, but then I hear shuffling. Some liquid flowing, more shuffling. Cold glass presses against my lips, moistness trickles down my chin. Soft fingers force my mouth open for the blessing to touch my tongue. Not nearly enough.

“More…” I’ll beg if I have to.

“Easy, now.”

This time I can move my arms, groping with trembling hands. I’m so thirsty. At last they bump into arms; my eager fingertips trace them towards my face and grab the cup with a strength I didn’t expect to have.

“Easy, easy. Take it slow.” Is that concern in her tone?

I won’t take it slow. She doesn’t know how much I need this. I upend the cup.

Now I’m drowning.

Strong hands grab me by my shoulders and sit me up, gentler ones keep my head upright. Each cough tears a new gash in my throat, as if that water had never touched it.

“She said easy. Let’s try again, but slower this time.” His voice doesn’t sound concerned.

He won’t let go. Why is he holding me?

I feel something tied around my head. Bandages? The smell of blood and waste almost overwhelms me when I finally notice it. I recall I should be bleeding, but can’t remember why.

“I can’t see.”

This is no bandage, it’s a blindfold. Fear creeps through my body. I must escape!

“No need to see anything right now.” His grip tightens. “It’s no use to struggle.”

“Save your strength for later.” She does sound like she cares. “You’ll need it.”

Who are these people?

“I demand to know where I am!” The authority in my voice surprises me. It seems unwarranted. The pathetic order of a broken man.

“You’re in no position to demand anything, Hand 052.”

Hand 052.

All those memories suddenly flood my mind again. The nightmare in the void. It *was* a nightmare, wasn’t it? Surely it was. It must have been.

No amount of wishing can transform the past in a bad dream.

In the wake of the sudden realization, all I’m left with is my shattered hope.

My body goes limp; tears stream from my eyes. This man is right: it’s no use to struggle. It doesn’t matter where I am or who they are.

That sword should have killed me. Why didn’t it? What happened then?

The woman lays me back down. “Rest now. Your questions will be answered in time.”

“It’s not answers I need. Just leave me here to die.”

The man chuckles. “You can be sure we’ll kill you if need be. Not here, though. It’ll just have to wait until Ard speaks with you.”

“Who’s Ard?” They don’t answer. I shrug, then cough with pain. “Whoever he is, he must come before I lose the last of my blood.”

A soft hand raises my head. “Here.” She grips my hair when I turn my lips away. “It’s just water. I know you want it.”

I’m still wary, but my body doesn’t let me refuse. I drink slower this time.

“You aren’t dying, at least not soon. The blood you smell is from your clothes.” There’s now a shade of pride in the woman’s tone. “The bullet didn’t go in very deep. I removed it and closed your wounds. Cef here said it was a waste of time, but I couldn’t just leave you that way.”

Cef snorts. “You’re lucky Sia has a soft spot for broken people. Messenger or no, she’s given you more than any bat has ever deserved.”

“Who *are* you?” Instead of replying, they go silent and stay that way.

Time seems to go slower and slower as those scenes keep replaying in my head, my pain never receding.

Just when I’m thinking the sound of dripping water will drive me crazy, I hear steps from somewhere in front of me. From the echo, I gather we must be in a very large room. I’m shivering, but whether it is from the lack of a fire or from some fever, I don’t know.

“At last I meet our famed Messenger,” says one of the newcomers. “And all bloody too, the second best kind of bat I know.” There’s a smile to his voice. “Nothing to say? I hear you were quite vocal that morning, Hand 052.”

I hear soft chuckles from all around me. Six people, at least.

How long have I been sleeping?

“Very well, let me begin, then. I’m Ard, at your service. May I know your name? I don’t want to keep addressing you as a number. After what you did, you certainly earned being more than that to me.”

I remain silent. Someone starts tapping their foot.

“You’ll talk to me, Hand. Rest as much as you need. Cef and Sia will keep you well fed until you’re back up on your feet. Now, if you’ll excuse me, there’s a city I must—”

Hurried steps come from behind him along with a very young voice. A girl.

“Chief Beetle, we’ve found two more infected in the streets.” She pauses to recollect her breath. “They were writhing in the gutters, but we’ve brought them in anyway as you ordered. They’re back there with the others.”

“I’ll go see them in a minute. You did well.” Ard’s attention turns back to me. “The sooner you talk, the sooner we can put an end to this, bat. What I need of you is far from done, you can be sure of that. We must finish what you started.” He steps closer, so close I can smell the onions in his breath. “Mark my words, a day will come when you’ll gladly call yourself my friend and boast that I am yours. When you’re done mourning the death of something that was already dead, you’ll thank me just as the world thanks you for your deed.”

“The world…?” I curse myself for taking the bait, but I can’t resist my curiosity.

“The people suffer now for what they did on that morning, more than they ever did by your peers.” He places his hands on my shoulders when I clench my jaw. “Because of you there’s now pain and blood on the streets, and worse.” His words are slow, deliberate.

I strain to remember that sunrise in the square, but it’s the same as trying to look through a brick wall. One thing is certain, however — the face of Harmony wasn’t mistaken in saying I had accomplished nothing more than my own condemnation.

Ard’s tone becomes more soothing. “I assure you their hearts are filled with gratitude because you helped open their eyes. Their present struggle is a necessary step towards the greater good of the empire. It *was* for the greater good you used to fight, I seem to recall. I ask nothing else of you.”

“That note came from your hands, didn’t it? Who are you? What do you want of me?” I ask between gritted teeth.

He pats my leg. “Not now. There’ll be enough time later for all your questions and for every answer I can give you. Enjoy these days of respite, use them to regain your strength. As I said, you and I still have plenty more to do.” I hear him turning to leave, but then he comes back. “I trust you’ll be more cooperative next time, yes?”

When I refuse to answer, Ard and his retinue finally leave me alone with Cef and Sia. They start whispering to themselves as soon as the others get out of the room. I can make out a word or two, but their conversation is lost on me.

“I’m hungry.” I’ve only realized it now.

The mumbling continues. I might as well have remained silent.

“I said I’m hungry.”

“You heard me the first time, didn’t you?” The threat in Cef’s voice is plain. “You’ll do as we say until Ard tells us otherwise.”

“You can eat later in your room. We’ll take you there in a moment.”

“Is there *anything* you can tell me?”

“There is,” they both answer at the same time, but only the man goes on after a pause. “I can tell you to keep your mouth shut.”

Still in pain, I feel nauseous and weak. So much so that I’m not even tied to whatever they’ve laid me upon. I knock lightly at it — wood.

“Can you at least give me more water?”

Cef grunts, but Sia eventually comes to me with her glass cup. Her steps sound like leather on stone.

“This feels like a table,” I say between sips. “Are you keeping me on display here?”

Her answer is barely audible. “Don’t push him. Chief Beetle didn’t order Cef not to hurt you.”

I lower my voice like hers. “Help me out of here.” I don’t think I have anywhere in the world to go, but I know I don’t want to be a prisoner. “Please.”

The woman lets out a little snort. “You’re amusing, bat. Rest now.” She takes back the cup and steps away.

Soon I fall into an uneasy sleep, reliving over and over again the worst moments of my life. Every time I see the blade gleaming in the air, I wake up with a scream and a jolt.

Either the dreams or the dripping will drive me crazy. The question is which will do it first.

Cef eventually comes and stuffs a dirty rag in my mouth. As my stomach heaves, bile and water drench the cloth and I retch again. My throat burns more than ever, the pain on my left side is unbearable. The blindfold is wet with my tears.

“He’ll choke!” Sia’s voice is startled as she bounds to my side. She yanks the rancid lump and tosses it on the ground. “What were you thinking?” She proceeds to wipe my face with a cleaner piece of cloth.

The thug’s answer is an amused laugh.

“Serves him right for all he and his ilk have done. He should be thankful I don’t make him swallow all his teeth.”

The woman doesn’t answer at once. “Here, help me take him to his room.”

“You mean his *cell.”* He’s still laughing. “Gladly. But it’s still an hour until the right time. Ard’s orders, remember?”

“Everybody has seen him already. If he stays here one more minute you’re likely to kill him.”

“As I well should.” He sounds like he might kill *her* if she tried to stop him.

“Ard’s orders, remember?” She’s growing impatient.

Cef grunts. “Fine. You go ahead. I need you to open the door for me.”

He grabs me and throws me over his shoulder as if I were a sack of produce, but I don’t scream. I won’t give him that pleasure.

Before long I lose count of their steps and turns. I may even have passed out on the way here, but now I hear the clinking of keys, then the creaking of rusted hinges.

If the large room smelled foul, I don’t know how to describe this.

Cef drops me on a damp straw mattress that reeks of dead bodies.

“Enjoy your stay,” he says as they lock the door with a heavy metallic thud.

“They’ll bring your meal soon, bat.” This is Sia. “Don’t get any ideas. Not all of us are as easily amused as me.”

The echo of their steps dies in the distance. I shift on the mattress, trying to find the least painful position. All I can do now is wait, and think.

I’m amusing.

It’s no use to struggle.

We must finish what I started.

Who *are* these people?

Right now I have no other choice but to do their bidding — I wouldn’t be able to resist a child if my life depended on it. I must play by their rules if I am to have any answers and any hope of escaping.

I *will* escape, eventually. I must just be patient, let them help me thinking I’m helping them. Ard thinks he can manipulate me with ease, but he doesn’t know me. I’ll resist his suggestions for as long as it is necessary.

They don’t know what I’m made of. If they think themselves so capable of breaking me, they have no idea of what I’ve been through. A man who destroyed his own world can’t be brought down by threats alone.

I have destroyed my own world.

It all started with a note.

A note.

Why am I resisting them? The question dawns on me with such clarity that for a moment I can think of nothing else. If they were the ones who wrote those words, Ard is right to say I should be thankful to him.

Thankful, not trustful.

As for him, he can rely on me all he wants. I’ll make sure he does. It comes with my job to be good at making people believe I’m on their side if I have to. He won’t be the first, and he has a lot of explaining to do.

So, I'm in the early phases of writing my first novel. A novel that I've had in mind for a long time. It has a couple accompanying short stories that are a ways from being final, but it's a fun hobby project so far and something that I've wanted to do for a few years. I've been traveling a lot for work and have suddenly found some free time to just sit and write and since I've started my brain is constantly thinking about it.

I found, though, that I need to practice writing, especially when it comes to descriptive writing. I started this reddit account (I have a primary account but this is my own little novelty) to do just that. I've started combing through r/pics and ITAP and have started writing very short stories or descriptions about pictures. I've used different styles and techniques, but they're just little 30-45-minute writing assignments that I've given myself. It's fun to just log in over lunch or in the hotel at night and do a quick writing.

I don't care about the karma but a little constructive feedback in the comments would be great...and reddit-at-large doesn't seem to be interested in the writing. I've been lurking a bit in this sub and the other writing subs to keep practicing reading others work, learning other styles, and just immersing myself.

I realize this is a little different than normal when it comes to posting stuff in this group. If there's a better way I'm all ears.

“Bai Jiang,” the officer announced sharply.

Jiang’s stomach muscles clenched as though the nervous butterflies that had been building up over the afternoon had instantly frozen. The young boy quickly stood, almost knocking the bench over, before hurrying into the general’s room.

He scanned the room upon entering, and soon noted the somewhat feminine General Zhang Hua trying not to look too bored. He smoothed his silken, plum robe from his position seated behind a low work desk. In a show of rudeness, he picked up his violet folding fan and casually began chasing away the heat of the day as he waited for the last new recruit to be seated.

“Afternoon, Bai Jiang,” he stated in an even voice, pulling a slip of parchment forward and inspecting it. “Low class, father dead, mother can’t support you?” he rattled off briefly. It wasn’t that he didn’t care; he was just weary of hearing the same story.

“Yes sir,” Jiang answered neutrally, staring at the ground to maintain a polite demeanour. His family had no status, but Zhang Hua’s was important enough that he could marry directly into their ruling family, Li. He was glad to get an interview, even if he had been forced to wait hours for this brief chance with a rude officer.

As he was inspected, Jiang tried not to get distracted by the feeling of the occasional puff of breeze on his recently shorn head. He would never cut it again after this, unless he disgraced himself in some way.

Zhang picked up the parchment and looked over the inked profile picture. Potential officers had more thorough records than the soldiers just doing their duty. Due to his father’s rank, Jiang was being considered for officer training, in spite of his low social class. “It seems a shame to send you to war. I’ve never seen such beautiful hair outside of my family!”

Though he knew the officer was toying with him, Jiang still had to physically bite into his tongue to ensure a retort would not leave his mouth. The gap between social classes angered him all the more when displayed so blatantly, and such petty concerns this man seemed to have. Jiang had been raised in this society, but he had never been able to complacently accept the disparity.

The change in his features did not go unnoticed. This man was not as flippant as he liked to make out. The role of general still had to be earned, even by a member of the highest ranking family.

“What are you frowning at boy? The only reason you’re even here is your father.” There was a lengthy pause before, “Well?”

If the man really wanted to know, then he would answer honestly. “I feel it is fundamentally wrong for you to worry about aesthetic beauty when my mother will soon be concerned with where her next meal is coming from.”

Rather than ordering the disciplinary beating Jiang had been expecting, Zhang simply laughed loudly. “Oh my, how cute! To think you would be bold enough to answer honestly, and with such a vocabulary,” he paused and then continued to speak more seriously. “You can’t help being born a peasant, boy. Your father’s reputation and grades earned thus far are the only things allowing me to admit you into our officer training program. Run along now, spear training will commence at the crack of dawn. You had best prepare yourself.”

General Zhang Hua had just spelt out the essence of Jiang’s perception of unfairness. He felt his temper rise, but managed to school his features. Rebelling now would not accomplish anything of note.

“Yes sir,” he answered rather stiffly. Jiang brought his right fist and left palm together for a brief salute, before being excused from the room. He made his way across the inner courtyard and entered the corridor, along which were the male student dormitories.

He slid open a door, only to be greeted by an empty room. It was messy and well lived in, and eight bunks in total lined the walls. The bottom bunk by the door was bare, bar a stack of bed linens. Jiang found his belongings had been placed under it, so he spread the sheets over the thin mattress. Besides a change of clothes, he hadn’t brought much.

A gong sounded, indicating it was time for the evening meal. He crossed the pale, compact dirt of the presently empty training courtyard and entered the already half full eating hall. Jiang sat among the boys of a similar age to him, and was served a bowl of rice, with fish and a green leafy vegetable he was unfamiliar with.

It did not take long to eat all that was before him. Before leaving for his sleeping quarters, Jiang returned his dishes to the expansive kitchen. By the time the other boys returned to their dormitory, he was already feigning sleep.

_________________________________________________________

Three men dressed in white worked tirelessly in front of Emilia. She could only sit and stare from the corner of the vehicle while a woman examined her. Emilia’s ears were still ringing and she couldn’t understand a single word that was said to her. Why they even bothered to bring her, she wasn’t sure. A tube was forced down Mr. Hawkes throat and one of the men attached it to a computer. Another man had cut away Mr. Hawkes shirt and was trying to clean the wounds. There were two clear wounds, one in his hip and the other directly below his breast. 

“Not lethal, but he’s bled a lot,” One of the men said, Emilia struggled to understand him. The woman that had been seeing to Emilia wrapped her up in a large white blanket. It was the warmest and softest thing Emilia had ever felt. She worried that her filth would defile this blanket…if it did maybe they would let her keep it. 
The woman smiled gently, patting Emilia on the head, “Go to sleep kid, you don’t need to watch this.” She said tenderly. 

Emilia couldn’t deny this woman this. She was tired, her body wouldn’t stop trembling and the ringing in hear ears refused to cease. Before she managed to give in to the tempting thought of sleep, she saw a blue silhouette appear next to Mr. Hawkes. The figure stared down at him, assessing the situation, before bringing a metal scalpel to his side. 

“Damn, aristocrats…can’t even die like the rest of us.” Emilia thought as she let the wonders of sleep finally take her. She wanted Mr. Hawkes to be okay, but at the same time she had already accepted this as her fate. This was her opportunity to make her life better, maybe achieve something that her parents couldn’t. An event like this though, the things she achieved should be shared. Why did everyone else in the lower dimensions have to suffer in filth why she was going to be saved? 

Just as sleep swept Emilia off into darkness, she made a simple wish. She wished that this would turn out okay that she would be able to rise to where the higher dimension people live. From her pedestal she would share her wealth, spread a better education and life style. Everything needed to be alright again. 
_____________________________________________________________________________

“So tell me again, what is it that you saw?” 

How many times had Emilia been asked this today? What time was it? Better yet, what day was it? It felt like days but maybe that was still the trauma talking. She still had the white blanket wrapped around her but had been sitting in an interrogation room as soon as she arrived at the hospital. Emilia had never seen such a clean and white washed place. The place simply smelled of cleanliness and sterilization. It was nothing like the hospital she had been born in. Here there were no rooms of crowded people undergoing surgery, giving birth or just suffering from one of the many diseases found in the lower dimension. This hospital was vast, clean and welcoming. 

The man that sat before her now was part of the Order Committee. He stared at her with eager eyes. His grey officer’s uniform with a red stripe down the side made him look like an intimidating figure but Emilia was still remembering her earlier scene of trauma. She didn’t care much for his image of intimidation right now. 

The man sighed and set down his tablet on a table. The screen was filled with her basic information: Emilia Settler, Age 16, born rotation 681. 

“He’s dead isn’t he?” Emilia asked quietly, completely disregarding the officer’s question.

The officer let out a long sigh, “We are an advanced race of people, you know this, but there is no guarantee that he will live from this. But the least you could do is help us find his killer, Ms. Settler.”

Emilia shook her head, “I have nothing but my own life left and I cannot risk losing that too.”

“You know, as an orphan you’re required to go to the bowels—honestly, I’m surprised that no one has come to get you yet.” The officer said, while gazing back at his tablet, “Plus your mother has been missing from work…for three years now?”

“Yes, but I have actively attended school and have kept average marks.”

“Right, these are above average for your dimension, it’s a shame. It’s good you have survived this long on your own though.” The officer really sounded as if this was a pity, but there was no future for someone like her in the lower dimension or the bowels.

There was a light knock on the door to the room. Another officer opened the door and peered inside. He looked weary and irritated. 

“Pack her up and get her ready to leave.” He said slowly as if they were words he was unsure of, “Her mother has come to get her.”

Both officers turned to look at Emilia, she didn’t believe either of them. Of all the times, why would her mother come back for her now? Emilia’s heart was beating hard in her chest, why did this need to be added to her shame? She wondered if she had heard them wrong, her ears were still ringing after all.

The soldiers held open the door as Emilia stood up and walked to the door. Her legs felt like jelly as she walked down the sterile hallways of the hospital. The hallway was empty of any staff or visitors besides Emilia. She was quite sure that there were many people here before but now it appeared to have been cleared out just for her. Emilia’s feet carried her to the waiting lobby that had also been mysteriously cleared out of any employee or visitor. Except for one, this moment had been created just for her. 

Emilia’s heart was still thumping hard in her chest, her hands were trembling at the thought of seeing her mother again. Although this is the worst time for a reunion, she wanted to see the familiar face of her mother. Maybe in her mother’s arms she could find peace with what had happened to Mr. Hawkes. In those warm arms she would feel safe going back to the lower dimensions. Her mother would just tell her that she had lost track of work or had maybe been working somewhere else, saving up money. They would be able to move into the apartments together.

That’s right…the apartments were gone. As well as all of the men, women and children that lived there. That woman, Chelsea killed them all, and for what? So she could have a new plot of land to build her house. 

Emilia sighed and gazed into the lobby, the windows had been closed with thick white sheets shielding them from view of the street. The woman that stood in the lobby was clearly not her mother. This woman was of average height and had wavy black hair that sat gently, precisely onto her shoulders. It molded around the collar of her long white coat. Her face was stern and her poise reminded Emilia of a queen from the books she read as a child. The woman’s lips seemed to be in a permanent pucker as though she had tasted something sour. She was roughly in her fifties but she looked like she could breath fire. Her arms were crossed across her chest and she seemed to be mentally dissecting all that made Emilia who she was. 

“What is your full name?"" The woman asked sternly, still examining Emilia closely. She walked around Emilia to get a better look at her.

“Emilia Settler,” Emilia replied quietly, she was beginning to shake off the trembling from her legs.

“Such an average surname, well you’re a Hawkes now, good lord I have so much cleaning to do with you,” The woman said bitterly.

“But ma’am, Mr. Hawkes is dead, he’s dead.” Emilia could feel tears welling up again.

“Shut up you foolish girl, it will take more than something like this to kill a Hawkes!” The woman snapped, ""I had expected more but this will have to do--you learn now, little girl. We are Hawkes and now you are one too! You will learn our way, be trained properly and will make his sacrifice worth something. You are now the daughter of me, Danielle Hawkes, mother of Daniel Hawkes.”

“Daniel Hawkes?” Emilia asked herself, she wondered if she should know that name.

“It’s your teachers name, you know, the man that’s dying for you.” 

Emilia slowly nodded. She had never thought to learn her teacher’s first name. There had never been any intention to eventually see him shot in front of her later and then be adopted by his mother. Emilia’s chest was aching. She had wished for things to turn out alright, but she didn’t want Daniel’s life to be lost in the process. She didn’t know this mysterious task master of a woman. Maybe all that this woman wanted was to keep her as a slave, to punish her for the death of her son. 

“Well my dear,” Danielle Hawkes started, “Let’s go home.”

Does anyone have ideas for what the story should be about? If you give me a prompt, I may post post a short essays on prompts and post in comments :)

I wrote 50,000 words off of one sentence before. Should be able to create at least a short story off of a title with a tad of help

Here's a piece of it:

 Chapter 001.0.2      Four bullets ripped though my body. Two of the bullets pierced my left lung. One of the bullets went into my upper diaphragm, while another tore through my right leg, severing what I was sure was my femoral artery. Everything went black, my legs gave out and I collapsed, sending myself hurtling to the ground; the momentum from my thwarted sprint across the battlefield sending me tumbling. For a moment I thought I was dead, until my computer chimed in with all sorts of critical warnings and pumping my body full of chemicals, automatically closing down the fresh wounds with artificial tissue. As oxygen began to pour into my blood and the adrenaline began to take effect, I began to feel... Not quite alive, but not dead either. I was... Systems online! Body functional! My computer chimed.      After a moment my vision returned. The signals were not reaching my brain. Inside my mind was an image of the terrain I'd been on right before I was shot. Two snipers were about five degrees east of my position, a few dozen yards away. Of them, one was on the second story of a run down looking square building. The other was on the roof of an adjacent building. They had caused the two gaping wounds to my lung. The other two wounds were from infantry solders not far off. One of the enemy foot soldiers took cover behind a sun bleached yellow truck that was peppered with rust and sitting on cinder blocks. This soldier, as well as the snipers, was providing cover fire for the fourth soldier. The fourth was also a foot soldier, now advancing across the dusty, desolate lot. I raised mechanically, my mind almost detached. I had just enough knowledge left to remember what my mission was. I took the hill as two more bullets struck, tearing my left leg apart. By now, I am beyond pain, my body intent on reaching its destination. I aim and fire. Three quick shots and the snipers are dead. Then I see her... ""NO!"" I scream over the gunfire. But it’s too late... ""SAMANTHA!!"" I scream... But it’s too late...      I wake up screaming her name, only to realize that I'm screaming into something; a pillow; Two pillows actually... ""Shut up Jason!"" Someone whispers harshly. As the war memories began to fade, I feel my chest, it's throbbing frantically, the blood not where it was moments ago. I am six foot five inches, and for the most part a beefy, muscular figure covered in light caramel skin. Right now, every inch of my body was covered in sweat, by brown eyes open wide and searching wildly about. My short black hair was slick and unruly. ""Shut up before you wake the boss!"" The whisper came again. Slowly, painfully, recognition returned. I was a body guard. I am a body guard for some lousy rapper. Who would want to harm him anyway? ""You straight man?"" The whisper came again, the person sounding a bit vexed.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_x1anw,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/x1anw/story_ideas_for_this_title_xpost_from_rwriting/,

There are many errors in this, some because i changed a few things, some because i haven't meticulously checked my grammar yet and so on and so forth, but it's currently not the type of feedback i'm looking for

things i do want to know
1. Is this interesting? why or why not?
2. Am i clearly communicating my idea (anything confusing?)
3. Do the conversations actually seem like two separate people talking? (this is my BIGGEST problem, I still think i suck at dialogue)
4. Any other non grammar comments?

What follows is the query that I'm using. If anyone has the time and interest, you could read it and maybe tell me what works for you and what doesn't. If you have any experience, and can provided thoughts, that'd be awesome. In advance, thank you.
Here it is:


Imagine if every song you knew was disappearing. Not just off the page, but right from your very mind. This is what is happening to the citizens from the land of City-Along-The-Lake. Music is literally being swiped from the very minds of the citizens themselves. And no one is safe from the theft. While those in charge believe this is an illness which can be cured by the medicos, Allegra, an immigrant opera singer from the Great Steppes, believes she’s seen the person responsible for stealing the music. To protect the memories of her past she must find, follow, and catch the music-thief before all the music is gone.

Allegra had come to City-Along-The-Lake, moving further and further away from her past. While she had been attending a conservatory, her gypsy clan was completely destroyed by a sleeping plague. She is left with only songs and memories that she finds too painful to recall but to important to lose. New music buries the old. Yet, when she sets off in pursuit of the music-thief, Allegra is forced to face her memories to access the songs so she can cross the lake and continue to follow and eventually get ahead of the music-thief.

Haunted by strange dreams based in her childhood, but wiith the aid of Gerendorf, a seven foot tall magicnician, Gabe, a drayman who happens to be the husband of one of the lake sirens, several highwaymen, Ingervold, a trader of musical instrument, a giant named Yib, and the reclusive musical prodigy, Archibald, Allegra eventually bests the music-thief, saving the music, and reclaims her past from her buried memories.

The Tale of the Music-Thief takes place in a world centered around City-Along-The-Lake. It is a place filled with music and magic. It is the Nashville and Silicon Valley of its world. Magic is being industrialized and utilized to make the everyday lives of the citizens that much better. From street sweeping golems to crystals that provide light, to crystals that play back music, the world is advancing. This is the world Allegra lives in and a world she finds herself trying to protect..

The Tale of the Music-Thief is a fantasy genre story that I wrote for several reasons. One was as a challenge to myself, to see if it was possible to build a world where magic wasn’t controlled by a few wizards or witches but was actually as common as baking bread or singing a song. The second reason was to explore the importance of music to memory. There are, for me, certain songs and albums that connect deeply to periods of time in my past. I wanted to see that come alive on the pages of a novel.

I have had several short stories published in magazines (The Storyteller, Aoife’s Kiss, and the next Ink Monkey Magazine) as well as in small press anthologies (Red Skies Press, Wicked East Press, and Static Movement Press).

As well as writing fiction I have also written plays. A few of my short plays have been produced around the world (Short &amp; Sweet Singapore, Sydney, Brisbane, and others) as well as here in California (Santa Cruz Actors’ Theatre’s Eight Tens @ Eight, Snowdance 10-Minute Comedy Festival, and the North Park Playwright Festival).

May I send you the complete manuscript that runs 99,000 words long?

You see the alien on the car

On the stroller logo, Gears of War

Mix elixir glowing blue

Skyline lazer, dead to the core


From A to Z it’s a long story

The endless dune of immortality

Portal to the end of the world

Seen it all, dare one to challenge me


The phoenix theory

We all have another chance

When you think you don’t

Take a second glance

Crowd surfing up on a cloud .

Furthest planet… waking hours

music notes… raining down

Second glow… atomic loud

After thoughts serenade the silence

Quick prompt… memory diving

Concrete cobwebs, midnight driving

In abandoned buildings I’m wall climbing


Red and black lion… poison ivy

In the background, flowers crying

The scar that no one sees

But I can see them wither and dying

The red jacket made her stand out in the dark against the cream-colored walls. Again, the hall light went out as she walked up the stairs. The light down the hallway casted shadows from the tree that looked like hands grabbing for her. Kristen used her phone to light the stairs so she wouldn’t trip.
	“Excuse me miss?” the quivering voice asked.
	“Uh, yes?” Kristen answered. Every instinct told her to keep walking but she froze in mid-step. What was the harm? Maybe the person was going to the same conference and was lost.
	“I’m a grad student here.” The awkward man stepped from the shadows. “I’ve seen you around and was wondering if you want to go to the beach with me.”
	“No, I’m sorry. I have a boyfriend and he wouldn’t like it if I went to the beach with a stranger at night.”  She started up the stairs to get away from him as fast as she could, but the man grabbed her.
	“Take my card.” His hands shook as he drew his card.
	Kristen forced a smile while taking it. But her feet couldn’t help her escape quick enough.

	“Did you kept the card?” Jackson said, pacing in the kitchen. 
	“God no! I tossed it as quickly as I could.” Kristen was washing her hands for the third time, but still they didn’t feel clean.
	“Then tell me you at least remember his name. Come on Kristen, you had to have noticed something.” His hands went through his hair. Whenever he got stressed about a situation he couldn’t control it was the first thing he did.
	“Of course I noticed things. He was a gangly, strange man. Very dated thinning brown hair. His clothes looked as though he just came from the nineties. Jeans held up by a belt, high on his waist, obviously two sizes too big. A shirt that was black and white with zig-zags that were faded.” Kristen felt proud for remembering so much but Jackson wasn’t. “What? I tossed the card as soon as I could. He gave me the creeps.”
	“I know. You did good getting out of there as soon as possible.” Jackson hugged her tight. “What if I gave you a taser?”
	“Babe, it only happened once. Yeah, he was a total creep, but still. I don’t need a taser.” Kristen stomped her foot like a five year old as the last four words spilled out of her. 
“Fine then. Take Tank with you to class.” Jackson petted the giant bullmastiff on his head.
 “Sometimes, I think you being a cop makes you blow things out of proportion,” Kristen teased. 
	“It’s not the cop in me. It’s the marine.” He pulled her in giving her a long kiss.   “But being your lover makes me blow things way out of proportion.” 

~ * ~
	It was two weeks since her encounter with Mister Creepy and Kristen avoided the stairs like the plague, just in case. But when she came out of her class after staying late with her teacher, she heard the voice again. This time she didn’t stop. There was no way he was here. Kristen’s class was clear across campus. Is he stalking me.
Kristen fumbled for her phone in her purse. Damn being polite in class and not keeping the thing out. She dialed Jackson. The phone seemed to ring forever, but he finally answered. “Babe, he’s here. Where are you?” 
“I’m on a call. Did you call campus police?” Jackson shut the door to his car. Kristen heard his lights come on. “If you can, go back to the class. If not, stay in the light. Just keep your keys out.”
“Okay. Please don’t hang up.” Kristen started looking around for someone she knew. She spotted Chris. Thank God! “Chris! Hey!”
Kristen’s stalker quickly turned when he saw Chris walking towards them. Even though Chris was a 6’4, giant, black teddy bear, he was still a  linebacker and very intimidating. 
“Were you talking to that guy?” Chris asked 
“Definitely not.” Kristen looked over her shoulder and the stalker was nowhere in sight. “Would you mind walking me to my car?” 
~ * ~
	The rest of the semester either Chris walked Kristen to her car or Jackson picked her up. She was still against the idea of carrying a taser. She was afraid she would shock herself. But the stalker still continued waiting. It didn’t matter what time she left her class. 
	Jackson almost went to war with the campus police when they told him there was nothing they could do. 
“You’re telling me that she has to get hurt before you can step in?” Jackson yelled so loud that Kristen could hear him from outside the office.
“This is a college campus,” the police captain told him. He sounded apathetic. “People are allowed to go anywhere they want.” 
~ * ~
	When the spring semester started, there was no sign of the stalker. Kristen felt her life was starting to become normal again. It was amazing not having to look over her shoulder, especially since her work was taking its toll. Working at the mall in fear of someone stalking you wasn’t the best situation for someone in customer service. And now with the biggest chocolate holiday coming, Kristen needed to be on her A-game.
	Men swarmed the store to buy their last-minute Valentine's Day gifts. Kristen had spent the last five hours tying bows to boxes of chocolates and chocolate-covered fruit. Her fingers were numb by the time she took her break. No one was allowed to take a real break, but they were allowed to eat in the stockroom. A dry turkey sandwich and a sad excuse for a salad were waiting for her.
Her manager stuck his head into the stockroom. “Kristen, could you get on the register? The line is out the door.” 
Kristen dragged her heels. What was the point of getting her master’s degree when she was still doing the same job she had at eighteen? At least the men were quick and easy. It was wonderful. They tossed their boxes of chocolates on the counter followed by their credit cards. Now if only every day could be like this - wham, bam, thank you, ma’am.
Yelling suddenly broke the smooth pace of the day. A man pushed his way to the front of the line. He wasn’t holding anything, but he was looking directly at Kristen. Kristen couldn’t be bothered by all of the commotion. She had get the line under control if she expected to enjoy her own Valentine’s Day. Besides, dealing with customer disputes wasn’t her job. That’s what the manager was paid to do.
“Come to the beach with me.” The raspy voice snatched her attention.
“Hey buddy, you should have asked her earlier. Get out of the way,” a customer snapped at him. 
Kristen started to shake. Without a word to anyone she darted into the stockroom. Her heart was racing. How did he find her? It had been months since she had seen the stalker and now he shows up at her work? Why was he such a creepy ass man? She should have taken the taser.
Kristen waited in the stockroom till they closed. Her manager swore up and down he saw the stalker leave. Kristen called Jackson but with her manager working tonight she told him he didn’t need to come get her.
Everything was fine walking out to the car. There were no shadows to spook Kristen and no person hiding in her backseat. But of course, that nasty little gas light was on. Damn, should have noticed that earlier.
Kristen pulled up to the gas station. She tried paying with her card, but it seemed like every pump was having issues. Kristen went inside and got an iced coffee with her gas. Got to stay awake just a bit longer and it’s better to be alert.
While she was pumping her gas, a large truck pulled up beside her. A small woman jumped down from the driver’s seat. She flashed Kristen a smile before going inside. As Kristen turned to place the nozzle back, something hit her on the back of the head. She fell forward smacking her face on the gas pump. The last thing she remembered was trying to see who had hit her.

Journal of a Modern College Student:
*Meaning me, but not really, but yes.*

March 19th, 2012

He didn’t sleep much last night. You see he had a test the next day. He’d love you to think he was up all night studying. The overworked, brilliant, under-appreciated college student. Working around the clock overwhelmed by the endless torrent of information he just must know to become successful and satisfied. On his gravestone would read the epitaph “Brilliance Worked to Death”.

Naturally, that’s a load of shit. And that is precisely what kept him up all night0. Definitely not work. He hardly ever did work. They did give him a lot to do. It was much easier not to do it. Maybe it’s a testament to his brilliance that he got this far with so little work. Or not. Probably not. What’s wrong with the path of least resistance?

If our decisions make us who we are, he was quickly approaching absolution. He avoided decisions. He hated conflict and somebody always had a problem with every decision that’s ever been made.
He had made one decision. Decisively. He loved her, and would continue to until the day he died. Even if it killed him. To date, there is nothing present in the medical literature detailing a death caused by loving someone too much. So he’s probably safe on that front.

In a few months time he would graduate from a prestigious university with a degree in biochemistry. He’d been squeezing into this scientist uniform for a long time now. If it was an actual uniform (it was not, that was a metaphor1), his stomach would be oozing over the pants like flesh colored silly putty and his shirt would resemble something a lonely chubby girl wears to the bar when she pre-games *before* picking her outfit. (*Scientist uniforms* apparently consist of a t-shirt and jeans in this metaphor.) What I’m saying is: he wasn’t a huge fan of his current direction and was deciding whether or not to make a decision to try and decide what he would do with his life. Besides procrastinate and put off decisions. As you might expect2, he came up with what he thought to be a pretty conclusive answer by the end of the night.

0 Up all night thinking that is. In a bizarre coincidence, his stomach was also bothering him.

A thousand dead races at our backs, and a universe that lay wide ahead.

We had the audacity to tame the engines that drove the universe and the very life around us, and yet death was still our greatest fear.

It’s not often Jeres comes out with something intelligent, and he can’t get his head around the big words, but when he makes a valid point by God is it valid. Unfortunately, he’s a racist sonovabitch the rest of the time. I've found myself hard pressed not to gut him more than once.
       	
As cumbersome as his presence was, I nodded in agreement. We’d been sitting in the carriage, pulled  by two aging draft horses, for three hours now, and while it was true I was glad to be out of the sun, I found myself restless. My ass had gone numb an hour ago, and my legs were just now threatening to go with it.
 	“Peace, Jeres. Almost noon now. Trent should be along with the distraction any minute now.” I said, staring out the small window to my left. A troop of Iron Guard at attention surrounded the small, one- storey bank, and they stood like stone. I admired them for that. Iron Guard could be depended on. Emperor’s first and finest troop. ‘Course, I’d seen what they really do, and their isn't a man alive on New Barbarossa since the failed uprising that didn't think of the Guard as rapists and child killers. Not that they’d ever say it aloud, mind.  
	
Their being here irked me some, though, because it made our job harder. See this small town we found ourselves in, Ellis, was famous for two things: The abundance of wild cattle in the surrounding hills, and the only bank for four hundred miles. We’d arrived a week ago, my men and I, and the plan was supposed to be simple. Bust in, put on an intimidating little show, and get out again. When the townsfolk finally raised the Sheriff, stationed twenty miles away, it would take him an hour or two by horse depending on how hard he rode. In such time we would be long gone, most of the bank’s money with us.
	
With the Iron Guard here, that was difficult, so we’d had to alter our plan a little. My second, Trent, would provide a nice little distraction so that we might get on with thieving without the threat of the Guard looming over us.
“You promised me loot, runt.” Jeres snorted. I turned to him then, the splendor of the Iron Guard no longer holding me, the spell broken. Put anyone next to Jeres and they look like a runt. The man was close to seven feet tall, carved out of solid muscle. So much so that you couldn't tell where his neck ended and his head began.
 	
“You’d best deliver if you know what’s good for you.” He added after a moment. That’s when I struck. In a flash the blade hidden in my sleeve was in my hand. Jeres drew the six shooter from his shoulder holster a millisecond slower, and that’s why he lost. 
 	
I wanted to drive my dagger into his chunky neck, wanted to feel the spray of his blood on my face as I opened his throat. My body wanted it too, and it went for it hard. But I changed its course, plunging the good steel into the hand Jeres used to steady himself on the carriage bench. I grinned as I felt the dagger part flesh and muscle, then slide without resistance into the thin wood. And I grinned when his blood surged up from the wound, as if it were a prisoner who’s cell had been left unlocked.
 	
“Threaten anybody, Jeres, threaten everybody if it pleases you. But not me.” I looked him in the eye, in them I saw that he was biting back a curse. “I’m like to do you one better than threaten.” And I twisted the blade. That’s when he howled, loudly had I not pushed myself forward and clamped my hand over his mouth.

Pulling steel free from flesh is certainly easier once you've twisted you’re blade a little, but I didn't want easy. I wanted him to suffer. Wanted him to learn his lesson in pain, the way I’d learned mine. So I twisted my dagger again, the opposite way this time, and I watched as Jeres clamped down on his tongue to keep from screaming.
 	
There’s a point when pain gets too much to handle. That point’s different for everybody. I've seen men scream bloody murder because of a flesh wound, and I've seen men push through missing limbs so they might fight on. 
 	
When Jeres reached his point, though, I didn't find out. Raised voices outside. I heard them plain as day as our carriage trundled past the front of the bank.
“Attacker! Looters and pillagers in the town!” A portly man limped into view, calling to the Iron Guard stood vigil around my target, and pointing the way he’d come. The man who I assumed led the Guard looked in the direction Porky was pointing, and I with him. Thick tendrils of black smoke drifted lazily into the azure blue sky from the south end of the town. The Guard Captain barked some commands, and perhaps three quarters of the men standing guard formed up and moved toward the smoke.
 	
“Well now, Jeres.” I said, sliding my dagger free of his flesh and clapping his shoulder with my other hand. “Time to earn a living!” Jeres stared at me with narrowed eyes while I stood and put my hand to the carriage door.
“I’m not afraid of you.” He said, barely louder than a whisper.
“Good,” I gave him my best smile. But it wasn't a smile, not really, it was the bearing of teeth that the bayed animal must show. “That makes one of us.”
 	And I stepped out of the carriage.""

It's been 6 months since the R-Virus hit. The government has fallen. Civilization has all but collapsed. In a matter of hours, every last human being without a reddit account was killed. Karma, once nothing but worthless internet points, translates into actual power. /u/PresidentObama has tried and failed to keep order. Our cities are nothing but husks of their former selves.
A super subreddit, comprised of the most horrifying subreddits imaginable (/r/watchpeopledie, /r/rapingwomen, /r/sick, and the one time defunct but newly rejuvenated /r/jailbait, among others) have joined forces in the chaos to become /r/rapeandpillage, a subreddit dedicated to terrorizing and destroying the rest of the world. Reddit's most karma'd defend /r/all as best they can, and life goes on.
But there's a new player working with /r/rapeandpillage, and even Reddit's most powerful users are being killed.

I find the Oulipo pretty fascinating, though I'm not personally a fan of some of their exercises (like the N+7 poetry, it's like a Mad Lib, but with less room for creativity..). But I just really like the idea of using constraints as a way of getting through writer's block or freeing up some creative ideas. 

I find using a technique similar to Queneau's *Exercises in Style* (http://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Style-Raymond-Queneau/dp/0811207897) to be really helpful if I get stuck in a story. Sometimes I realize that it actually works way better written in a completely different style--sort of like an extreme version of genre-bending.

Blood pooled in the sandy grit of the prison cell, its source waiting for finality in an apathetic daze. The pain had been as nothing. He cared so little for life and loss, that the puncture had only left him surprised, amused, grateful... but ultimately uncaring.  
His grubby hand reached up to the hole in his chest, and he felt it, letting the sticky warmth swarm between his fingers. Squelching, fleshy sounds as he put a finger inside. He giggled. Without context, the pain was just another odd sensation.  
Withdrawing the stained, iron-scented finger from his own sullied flesh, he had the urge to taste his own life: and so into his mouth the finger went, his nostrils and tongue abuzz with metallic fragrance and spice.  
One fervent glance around at the surrounding cells, and he found there was no-one there. Still. As it was every day when the guards left him and went back up. Oh, how he had come to love life down here. Solitudinously free of judgement! Free! Oh how the shackles and chains and bars were trappings of his liberty, bless you all! Bless my crime and bless the victim for pestering me to the cusp of murderous abandon and rage (shoulda never married 'er, the whiny bitch. Oh well, her fault she was attracted to commanding partners. Bitch probably enjoyed dying! Bitch! I remember how she spasmed and choked - she used me - those vulgar expressions of her prime pleasure. She always did like pain. I know because of how, when I hit her, though she cried she would remind me of how she loved me, and sarcastically told me to stop and then told me again how she loved me. Affection was something she was always so good at... and sarcasm. Always made me laugh. An angel, she was.... Oh, hope, how I miss her. I miss her... but she wanted to die. She used me. She was selfish...)  

Handful after handful of blood - then, blood and flesh - was lifted to his rambling mouth, sputtering and spraying black-red as particles of his own flesh lodged in his cracked throat.  
Beneath ravenous fingers, where butchered living flesh gave way to uncovered ribs, overgrown, mouldy fingernails scratched as they sought for more. Blood and raw-self danced jauntily on his senses, lustful delusion morphing the taste and smell into an imagined feast of nobility. Exotic wine and princely spice upon crisped lamb. Handful after handful.

   Creamed corn is my favorite. But every once and awhile, when the wind isn’t too bad and we can sustain a fire, me and Sparks will get to splurge and eat some warm Spaghetti-O’s. Then that’s my favorite. But that’s not very often. Just the other day he, Sparks I mean, came from the outside saying that it looked like it was going to be one of those days. The wind wasn’t too bad and we were both really excited about the possibility of sitting down, making a fire, and sharing a delicious can together. And maybe a nice drink, too. Sparks has been drinking a lot lately. I let him because, well, why not? He’s so small. It’s not like he’s going to use up our supply. And, he’s my best friend. And it’s his water, too. He can drink it if he wants.

  But by the time we sat down to start warming up our treat, the wind had really picked up. Sparks said it was my fault, but I doubt it. Besides, how would he know? He had been outside all day, out of our home. And all I did while he was gone was tap pebbles off the window. I’d throw them up, wait for to hear them tap off the glass with a loud tink, and then try to catch them as they came back down. Sparks almost caught me, but I heard the ticking and tapping of his nails against the cold, steel floor as he re-entered our home. He had mastered re-entry mode by now. Ha. Poor, Sparksy the first couple times I sent him out on trips. He would walk right through the shower and blow-dry machine and into the glass. His little nose scrunching as I waited for him on the other side. Poor guy.

  I think Sparks misses home. He cries sometimes when he thinks I’m sleeping. He’s restless at night. Gets up, walk around, looks through the glass to outside. I don’t know what he’s looking at. Whenever I look out the glass at night, I have to make sure I still have my eyes open. There’s nothing to see. Sometimes I think he’s not looking at all. That he’s hoping that someone is looking at him. That’s what I do. I look outside the window at the shadows on the ground. It’s weird. My shadow is always right under me. But there are shadows on the ground outside the windows. The people must have lost them. One is in a car and the hands are still on the steering wheel.

   Across the way, though, right across the street there’s three perfect shadows all holding hands. One really tall one, one shorter with long hair, and another little shadow that’s just about my height. The little one must have been wearing a dress because her shadow forms in the middle like a triangle. I wonder what that little girl is doing without her shadow? How does she know when it gets dark? The other day I sent him out in daytime and that’s all I did. I stacked some books on top of our desk and hoped to see something. Or someone. Especially someone. But there was no one there, and no one showed up. I wanted to join Sparks outside, though. I wanted to walk through the empty streets. I missed walking down the concrete streets in my old neighborhood. I missed trying to balance on the curb as me and Sparks walked around the neighborhood.
          
  I didn’t tell Sparks, because I don’t want to get his hopes up, but the other day I heard someone call back to me. I was looking through the glass where the light bends between the crack. This is where the wind enters. It’s just a tiny little crack but it runs through almost the entire window. Once I stood in front of it and put my arms out to pretend I was flying. This was, of course, while Sparks was out. It was dumb. I didn’t even feel like I was flying at all. And the stupid air dried my lips up and I had to drink whole bunch of water. We don’t have much left.

   Anyway, I put my face up to the glass and screamed ‘Hello’. I was screaming at the top of lungs hoping and praying that someone could hear me. Someone must have heard me because a couple seconds later someone screamed ‘Hello’ back at me. I was amazed. It was the first time I had heard someone else’s voice, besides Sparks, since we moved in here. It could have been a bunch of people, too! Because I heard multiple “Hellos” come back, each one more quiet than the one before it. The military guy said that when I heard things from far away, I could tell how far they came from by how quiet they were.   

  “Now if you hear a really loud bang, that means it’s really close and you should activate Red Lockdown. If it’s far away, and you can barely hear it, it’s far and the shelter... I mean house will take care of it on it’s own. Got that?” he said. I remember because I was taught, back in school way before all of this, that when someone looks you right in the eyes you should remember everything they say.   

   I think it was my Uncle, who screamed back, but I’m not sure. I placed my face up to the glass again. It was warm now because of my hot breath against it. I shouted ‘UNCLE JERRY?!”  and he shouted back at me “Uncle Jerry!” to tell me it was him! And then the other voices shouted “Uncle Jerry?”! I guess some of them were confused as to why one of us was shouting for my Uncle. If they knew him, they’d be calling for him too. Uncle Jerry must be underground like me. He was always working on cars so he probably built a pretty sweet under-home like mine. I wonder if he has any Spaghetti-O’s. If I knew where he was maybe I could send Sparks over to his under-home for the night. But I don’t know where he is.   

   I don’t know where anyone is. I haven’t seen mom or dad since Sparks and I got dropped off here in that airplane. Last time I saw them we were all in the car. Sparks was in my backpack. Mom and Dad didn’t know. I threw him in there with a couple pieces of food in case he got hungry. Dad said to leave him but Sparks loves ice cream and Dad said they were giving away free ice cream at the 7-11. But the 7-11 was two cities away and we’d have to take a drive. He said we’d have to really book it if we wanted to get there. I guess that’s why there was so much traffic. That was the most traffic I had ever seen. I imagined two teams on both sides of the highway. On my side, the red team and on the other side of the highway the white team. I don’t know what the game was but either way, neither team was winning.

   A really loud helicopter flew over us and said something. I don’t remember what that was because the man wasn’t looking into my eyes. He wasn’t even looking at me. I don’t even know if it was a man. It kind of felt like it the helicopter was just shouting at us. Whatever he said, though, people didn’t like it. They all began to scream and a lot of people were asking for God or something. I don’t know who that is, but maybe he’s like the President and helps people.

Mom and Dad looked over at me. They were crying. I think it was because they knew we weren’t going to get that ice cream. Maybe that’s what the helicopter said to us. That they had ran out of ice cream. Anyway, Mom picked me up and showed me to the Helicopter. She screamed please over and over again. This was OK because we were outside and she could use her outside voice. That’s when the helicopter swooped down and it’s door opened. Mom started to scream like crazy. Dad ran over and began hugging and kissing Me and Mom. He looked at me right in the eyes and said “They’re going to take you, ok? They’re going to take you to the ice cream. I love you!” And then mom started screaming she loved me too. The military guy reached out for me and as he did some other people around us started trying to grab onto the helicopter. Mom wouldn’t let go, though. She held on to my hand until it felt like it was going to rip off like that one time my Corduroy Bear’s arms stitching came undone.  The helicopter started to go up and up and I I just kept looking at mom and dad as they got smaller and smaller. She just kept screaming “I love you” over and over again. I don’t understand why adults say that so much. It’s obvious we love each other. We’re family.

I never got that ice cream. I wonder if Mom and Dad did.

Harrison Schooler

	In a land far away, not even on this planet lived a man. He was no ordinary man, he was short but strong. His face was crooked and his teeth perfectly white. His eyes would drift in there sockets but there color was stunning. His feet were different sizes but his walk was that of a runway model. His name was Smalls and he lived as a clown. He hated it, wearing makeup and causing irrational fears in children. He wanted a better life. He would soon get his chance.
	Smalls pushed though the folds of the Circus tent while wiping makeup of his face. He was thinking of where he would go if he could leave this place. Then it hit him. Pulling the piece of paper off of his face and then read it.   Come To ORT, the city of wonders, and the land of happiness.   Smalls was captured by the illustration on the flier. He was going to ORT but as he was leaving he thought of his friends. I shouldn't leave with out telling them, Smalls thought. He walked into the sideshow car and said farewell to his only friends the strong man and the bearded lady. 
  be safe   the bearded lady said, 
the strong man in a more husky tone said   if you ever need us you know where to find us  . 
the bearded lady stood and gave him a hug and the strong man extended his hand.
   here take this   the strong man handed him a pen then said   write us sometime when you get there, now go before the sun rises  . 
the strong man ushers him out the door. After Smalls had left a small tear ran down the strong mans face.
	Smalls walked long and hard, for seven days he marched hardly stopping except for twenty minute power naps, and a bit to eat. Smalls walked as strait as the crow flies, over mountains, in swamps, across lakes. Just as Smalls was settling down for a quick power nap a man approached him. 
  Halt   the man shouted,   What is your doing here  . 
Smalls turned away from the man then replied 
   sleep  
  not now  ,the man walked closer,  What is your doing here  
  sleep  
The man was puzzled   you came to ORT to sleep  
This caught Smalls attention whirling around he said    ORT is here  
Smalls turned so fast his eyeball were sliding across his head, they rested looking at the ground, he blinked where they then settled on the guard.
The guard stepped back in shock, then stammered   what are you?  
  a man, just like you.  
  your no man you re a demon   the guard pointed his finger at Smalls   only demons would be so perfect and so ugly, no demon will ever enter ORT.  
Smalls took a step backwards. The guard pointed his gun at Smalls chest,   now leave evil one   
Smalls turned and from the back he look like any regular person just a little small. As he walk he came across a man trying to climb a tree. Smalls stopped in front of the man then asked what he was trying to accomplish. The man dropped down from the tree and shook smalls hand then introduced himself as ham.
  Ham?   Smalls Said
  yes ham   ham said
  OK   
And that was the end of the name conversation, back to why was Ham climbing a tree. Ham explained that in that tree was an apple. Smalls looked up and saw it top limb very high. Ham was tall but not that tall. Smalls asked for a try and Ham backed away dusting off his white tuxedo. Smalls looked at the tree then gave it a good push. Smalls heard the apple land in a patch of grass behind him. 
Ham then said   So what   Ham stopped to take a bite from his apple and with his mouth still full asks   brings you out here  
Smalls then explained that his ultimate goal was to get to ORT.
ORT is that way, Ham said pointed the way he just came.
  I know they wont let me in, they think I am some sort of demon  
Mouth still full Ham said   do they, I have had no such thought, lets go see what we can do about that.  
Smalls wiped away apple goblets then tried to explain why this wouldn't work but he followed anyways.

	Smalls and Ham approached the guard that had earlier pointed a gun at Smalls, but strangely hadn t said a word at his return. It was almost like he wasn t there. Ham still eating the apple started to speak to the guard. The guard snapped to attention, bits of apple hit his face.
  my friend and I are requesting entry to ORT   
	Ham soothed. The apple had disappeared, Smalls wondered if he ate the core. The guard signaled for the gate to be lowered. ORT was Huge, 100 foot walls, and a deep moat that only made it look bigger.
  Enjoy your stay Gents.   
	the guard said then motioned for then to enter. Ham and Smalls walked across the drawbridge. ORT s main street was bustling with people. Smalls feet hit the cobblestone, ham looked at him and said   I will see you again  
Smalls turned to say he doubted it but he was not there not even walking away, gone.
	Smalls walked the streets, people would gasp and scramble to get away from him, he asked a passerby where he should go they screamed back at him 
  THE CHURCH   
	then pointed there crosses at him. ORT was a strange place. Smalls then thought well if people say I should go to the church then I should go. Towering far above the other buildings was the church steeple, a massive cross rested atop.
Smalls began walking towards and as he did so people became more and more strange. He was pelted with water, people reading scripture, and crosses thrusted into his face. As he ascended the steps of the church, people stood around the steps watching, seeing, waiting. Smalls turned around looked at the people then said 
  what  
They ran like he summoned the apocalypse. Smalls just shook his head and entered the door. The floor was carpeted with red velvet, large stain glass windows let in colored light, hundreds of pews formed rows along the floor. Smalls walked down the center isle. The Pope sat in a chair at the end of that row. Smalls walked to talk to him. Pope frozen in fear began to speak when Smalls asked if he knew where a bathroom is.
  BEGON FOUL CREATCHER   
	the Pope put his staff in the air, the golden cross atop reflected light right into Smalls eyes he covered his eyes and began to step backwards. The Pope smiled 
  YES FEAR THE CROSS   
	the Pope reached in to his pocket and grabbed a vile of holy water and tossed it in its entirety.
The glass from the vile cut Smalls arm. The Pope became more aggressive after seeing this 
  IT MUST BURN   
	the pope then rushed at Smalls. The entire time this was happening all Smalls could think about was why ORT was so strange. Old people blinding me with sun and cutting me with glass. Small then said forget it and began to walk away 
  YES LEAVE EVIL ONE  . 
	As Smalls was exiting he swore he saw the shadow of a tall man in a window. The crowd out side the church had dispersed a little only a few remained looking victorious when they saw the blood on his arm. Ort was no holy city, far from it, its streets were paved with desperation of the next dollar. Its people spoke lies in order to gain others trust. Its water ran red with the deception of its leaders. The pope was the most vile of them all. He held ceremony s in his name and collected tribute for himself.

One character is a sort of android.  He's got a real human body (with a few mechanical modifications, of course) but basically a computer for a brain.  His ""brain"" however, adapts to his surroundings and mimics the human behavior he sees (not like a ""monkey see, monkey do"" thing, but a slow adaptation).

The other character is a black market antiquities dealer.  She was going to be a historian, but because of some family issues she kind of gave that up.  Plus, historians aren't highly valued because all archives are computerized and robots can be programmed to do everything a human would do.

The idea is that the android has escaped from the lab where he was built, and he finds the girl and she kind of teaches him how to be human.  There's more to the plot line than that of course, but that's the basics of the two main characters.  What I need is a way for them to meet and a reason for them to stick together.  Anything will do, no matter how crazy.

This is a sort of sci-fi/cyberpunk story, set on a planet that is very similar to Earth but much more advanced.  

Something that might affect any suggestions about their meeting: in this world, or maybe just the main city (haven't decided yet), all the underground dealings literally take place underground in a system of tunnels and caverns that were built centuries ago.  This is where the girl would spend a lot of her time.

Anyway, I know this is vague, but I kind of don't want to give away too much of the story.  Any help you can give will be greatly appreciated!",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_t96s0,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/t96s0/need_some_help_working_out_an_idea/,

**The Return of Captain America**

**I**

Tommy sniffed the mouth of each jar in turn, grimaced agreement, and threw a pinch of spice into the simmering oil. He heard shower running in the bathroom. On the second burner, rice boiled, streams of starchy water crusting on the sides of the pot. He tipped a can of lentils into the blackened mixture and stirred.

Tilly stepped from the bathroom, hair wrapped in a towel. She saw Tommy setting the table. A stubby candle flickered in the saucer. Dusty sunbeams diminished it brightness, but she still smiled at the touch. 


“Anything I can get from the kitchen?”, she asked.


“A piece of kibble.”


She handed him the nugget and he set it before sleeping Rufus, gave a small bow, and proclaimed “This is for you, my buddy.” Rufus lifted his lids.


Then Tommy scooped a spoonful of rice and lentils, shook off loose grains, and proffered them to Tilly with equal gravity.


“What's this then?”, she asked.


“We're having Indian, so I thought we do the whole Hindu thing. So before you start to eat, you have to feed a dog, a cow but we don't have that, a god I think but we don't have that either, a person and I forgot who's fifth.”


She smiled, took the food, said it was very good if a little spicy, and fed him a heaping spoonful in return. Then they ate in happy silence.


**II**

The scrapped plates lied before them, and Tilly's Deep Rich steamed from Marvel mugs. They agreed the lunch was just perfect, and they should do something fun next.


“We could get the newspaper”, said Tilly. “There's a supplement today.”


“It's just war, war, war and politics. Don't want that really on such a pretty day. But how about go see a movie?”


“That's not a bad idea. Which supers are on?”


He awoke his Galaxy. Luckily, the network was up. He began to scroll.


“Pretty much all of them. Hulk, the Surfer, wow – the new Batman!, Daredevil, the new Iron Man...”


“I really wanted to see the new Wolverine.”


“We'll definitely go see Wolverine, but it's new, so it'll be around for a while. The new Captain's supposed to be really good, so maybe we should catch that while it's on.”


“Capt'n sounds great!”, she said.

**III**

They got dressed, filled Rufus's bowls, unplugged all appliances, shut the blinds and hopped in the car. They came to a barrier of signage and tape. Behind it rose a mound of rubble. Slag, tangled rebar, shards of asphalt showing black underbellies. Tommy backed, swung right, and took a detour. They reached the mall on time.


Their love seat tickets in Tilly's bag, they browsed in a bookshop across the cinema, calling each other across the shop to check out a graphic novel, a smartphone sleeve, a keyring with historic events that took place on your birthday, a mug shaped like something else, a CD of Dr House playing jazz with famous guests.


Tommy picked up the big fat “The Complete Book of Indian Cuisine.” He flipped through it. Ghee in clay pot, a close-up of deeply green bindhi, a tray of boondi laddoo arranged before a golden-blue Ganesha.


“Hey, look, Till”, he called. “This one's just three dollars!”


“Sure, buy it if you like.”


“I'll probably never make half of this stuff. I'll never have the ingredients.”


“Then buy it for the pictures. You deserve a little treat, babes.”


He turned to the checkout.


“Hey”, she said. “Um, read this on the cover.”


She passed him a thick black paperback. Praise quotes told him that inside was a “viperish mystery” and a “gripping [...] page turner.”


“That's just one dollar. You can have it, if you like.”


“Would you buy it for me, then?”


**IV**

“We so didn't need those”, Tilly said when they left the store, two books in tow.


“It's all right”, Tommy said, kissed her, and they entered the cinema.


**V**


They returned 3D glasses to a tray and stumbled, wide-eyed and quiet, into the bright lobby. “Captain America” had impressed them. 


The mall was closing for the curfew. Clerks pulled bars down on their shops. Locks clicked. Tommy and Tilly  walked down a corridor, looking for an elevator.


They saw huge framed photographs hanging from a wall. A sign announced “National Geographic presents: The Progress of War.” A carcass of a taxi on ground zero, London. A hit on the Great Pyramid, the plume still visible, stones toppling onto the silhouettes of an army in the dust below. Charred civilians against the backdrop of New York in flames. World War Three in all its misty, grainy, beautifully composed National Geographic glory.


“Let's go the other way”, said Tommy.


“Why? Let's see all pictures.”


“Because I want to go the other way. Why is it always 'why'?”


“They disturb you, don't they?”


“Since when are you a psychologist? I just, merely, feel like going the other way and I kindly ask you to please, please indulge me just this once.”


Tommy was happy to see Tilly shrug and turn around in time not to see it. A stiff dog in some war zone, its entrails extending into the perspective. He couldn't begin to imagine the pain it would have caused her.

**VI**

They arrived home in time for curfew. They relaxed on the sofa, one hand each on the happy Rufus, the other flipping through their new possession. 


“Wow, a chapter on daal! A chapter on breads! How to make yoghurt at home! Tills, thanks so much for this book.”


“Well, it was your money, babes.”


“But you let me spend it on myself.”


“In that case, you're welcome. On the condition you cook me out of that book when you'll have the ingredients.”


She hugged and kissed him.


“And thank you for the perfect day.”


Outside, darkness enveloped the blacked-out town. Galaxies shone on the night sky. Airplane engines hummed somewhere, up there; bringing death, perhaps, or shipping it somewhere else. Beyond the horizon, bombs were falling.

The cold hard stare of the man’s eyes. A bright blue memory to haunt all of mankind. His watchful eye. Never blinking. never moving. Never forgiving. Never showing remorse. always there, always watching. The eye. A never ending nightmare that has haunted all those who dare to step out of line. All seeing, all knowing, all judging. This was our freedom, our reward , for the sacrifices we have made and will ever make. For years we were grateful, the price worth paying, the hero of decades past. But, now we see the real cost, the tragic irony, the cost of our freedom. Our freedom. 

The corroded, rusted manacles have long since sliced through my wrists, the sound of dripping blood splattering against the cold concrete floor has echoed round the small square box for days now. I hardly notice the sensation of the warm red sticky substance running along my palm, like a small river following the contours of my deep scars and down to the tips of my index and middle finger. It was nice to begin with, a striking contrast to bitter cold that envelopes the rest of my body, a warmth of hope and chance, a sickening delirium. 
Drip.             Drip.            Drip.         Drip.         A dead man waiting. 

Chance. I never used to believe in chance, everything used to be so ordered, so structured, a defined pattern that could never be broken. Not without pain, I still hear the school boy screams of one classmate. I still dream about him, all those decades ago. Dragged out of the classroom by his legs like an animal, the last we ever saw of him was the sickening snap of his arm as his arm was forced away from the wooden frame of door;  his screams for help haunt my every nightmare until the inevitable  sickening fud and the slap of a small body hitting the floor . The eye knows all, was all we were told.  But now, now I am chance, the creation of a choice, a forbidden apple of impossible hope. 
Is that Voices outside? It must be getting close. The end draws near. One nightmare over, a world of dreams just beginning. A new beginning. Begin. Be.

In time the trees thinned and gave way to high grass and shrubbery. By then Aderyn was wheezing and her eyes and exposed skin felt red and raw and itchy. She needed to rest often and she drained the bottle of water Resh gave her.

“Your injection is wearing off,” he said, worry coloring his voice. “We need to get you to the tunnels soon or you’ll relapse.”

Aderyn felt sluggish of thought as they stumbled through the field. She hardly reacted when an insect stung her hand, though Resh seemed to worry over the tiny wound. By the time they reached a gaping hole in the ground, the light of Querra slid behind the massive mountains, plunging them into darkness.

She didn’t remember being carried the rest of the way, but the woman who injected something cold into her veins told her she had. “I think he’s taken with you,” she said with a shake of her head. “But he always did have a heart for stories.”

“Stories?” she muttered, feeling the fog begin to fade from her mind and the burning lessen in her skin.

“That boy who brought you,” the woman said. “He sees a legend, a destined love or ending in every thing.” Aderyn heard her sigh. “It’s no good for him.”

Slowly, breathing became easier and while she still felt weak, the will to move returned easily enough. She sat up and gazed about. Unlike the previous room she’d been in, this one was brightly lit with several cots covered in clean, crisp, white sheets. Several men and women lay on them, some asleep and some not. One of them glanced at her but then looked away, shutting her eyes.

“I’m Aderyn,” she said to the woman, who came over and pressed two fingers to Aderyn’s wrist, then felt her cheeks. She was older, as old looking as Aderyn’s grandmother was when she died. *She was four hundred and twenty-two… Groundlings don’t live that long.* She ignored the thought that Nulls didn’t either.

“Hello, Aderyn,” the woman said, removing her hands from her cheeks and turned to pick up a stick of shiny plastic. She used it to make marks on a sheet of something, paper perhaps. Groundlings sometimes used paper, didn’t they? Her research was escaping her at an alarming rate.

“What’s your name?” Aderyn said.

“Mm? Oh, most call me Governess,” she said and brought back another metal device that she pressed to Aderyn’s exposed arm. She didn’t remember pulling down the jumpsuit’s top. “This will pinch.”

It did and she let out a short gasp and the woman helped her back into the jumpsuit.

“You haven’t been planetside much, have you?”

Aderyn shook her head. “No, only once on Hyperia.”

“Shows. Your antibodies are non-existant. Were you born into service?”

“I…” she began and caught herself. *I am a groundling servant. That is all.* “I… yes.”

Governess looked over her shoulder at her, dark brown eyes squinted slightly. Aderyn looked away, worried she could see right through her lie. She caught sight of that girl looking at her and Aderyn frowned. The girl had a mask over her nose and mouth, only her light blue eyes showing. Her head was shaved, leaving only hint of what might have been blonde hair. *Do I know you?*

“How is she?”

Aderyn turned back to see Resh appear in the doorway. He looked even slighter in the harsh light of the medical room, his features wan and cheek bones and jaw sharply visible. He smiled at her and Aderyn forced a smile back, though fear boiled in her stomach. She was not safe here. She had to get back to her mother, warn them… *My mother is dead.* The thought did not upset her and Aderyn felt sick that it didn’t.

Governess snorted. “She’ll take weeks, months maybe, to acclimate. You found a purebreed for sure this time. Should have just left her, she probably belongs with them.”

Resh ignored her and came to Aderyn’s side. His light eyes caught hers and she felt that fear grow, mixed with sorrow and regret. *He saved my life… saved it by not killing me.*

“It’s all right,” Resh said. “She says that to every space-born we find. Convinced every last one of them preferred to be a slave than be free.” He rolled his eyes. “Is she all right to come with me?”

“Sure,” Governess said, not looking at them. “Please, take her off my hands.”

They walked into a tunnel made of impervaplast. The shiny walls showed her reflection and it made her gasp. She reached up and for the first time realized her hair had been cut short. Where it used to reach near to her waist, it now swung free just below her chin. How did I miss that? How sick was I?

“Sorry about that,” Resh said. “Some of it was covered in burned. It’ll grow back.”

She nodded but didn’t say anything in return. The tunnel had several doors inset along its length. Some of them were open, exposing what looked like living quarters. Aderyn saw two older-looking groundlings with a baby in the man’s arms. They looked up as Aderyn passed and she looked away.

“How many live here?”

“About two thousand,” Resh said. “This tunnel is only one of the wings, there are about ten or eleven I think. It’s crowded but it’s better than being a slave. The city folk are… well they’re a little better off I guess but I’d rather live here.”

*Two thousand. Are all of them armed like Resh was?* Aderyn’s family only fielded two dozen knights. Less than that now, she imagined. Much less.

“How did you build all this?”

“We didn’t,” he said. “We found it.”

*Found it?* Aderyn couldn’t imagine any noble family constructing something like this and just abandoning it. There was something going on that she didn’t understand but if she could stay, convince them she was just a servant… maybe she could beg forgiveness for what she’d done with the information. Her father would take her back then. Wouldn’t he?

“Here,” he said and opened a door. She stepped through it and stopped, the fear in her gut turning to terror. The room was empty except for a table seating five older groundlings and two young men holding weapons on either side of it.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_1cjjap,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1cjjap/criticismfeedback_the_blood_part_10_serialized/,

Here is my attempt at writing a story with a greater meaning.
It would mean a lot to me if you guys could go through it and give me some productive criticism.
For anyone who is going to read it, I regard John Green as the epitome of shallow literature (not valid but it was an inside joke with a friend I have for whom I originally wrote the story). Please **PLEASE** go hard on me!

&gt;""LAWLCATS"", slurs the naïve little girl, poking the sleeping dragon with the tip of her pokey stick, ""I want to sound smart! Teach me!”. Her laughter echoes the empty hallways of the library, shuffling through infinite volumes of undisturbed books, unread words, unseen potential and untouched knowledge.
He wakes up. Her laughter stops, morphing into a scream as it frightfully scrambles behind bookshelves in a panic. The dragon's stomach growls, she shuts her eyes, looking away thinking, ""if he can't see me I can't see him"". The dragon leers at her, ""Breakfast?"", he ponders. No, his appetite craves for more than a chunk of meat, it craves for revenge.
He breathes in.
She stays put.
He sucks in.
She stays put.
He unhinges his jaws and forces streams of furious winds down his void throat.
She stays put.
He huffs and puffs and pulls in air with the power of a thousand fucking suns.
She stays put.
But above her, typhoons of ink squeeze through hurricanes of binary code, entering the dragons mouth as he chows down on hardcopies for starters and softcopies for desert, preparing his unsatisfied anger for the main course.
The girl groans ""give me back my books you ugly son-of-a-bitch""
""Okay"" says the dragon as he shoves his tail down his throat forcing a vomit (a swag trick he learnt when he was going through a phase of chronic bulimia as a teen)
He pukes, ink splatters on the girl, lumping into bottomless puddles below her feat,slowly, creeping up her ankles, playfully, looping around her knees, slyly, scattering around her thighs, spreading out into minute strands of lace that tickle and tease her hips, preparing, for a suprise attack, preparing, to pounce. The dragon can't help a sinister smile as they reach the edge of her skirt.
And then, the ink rushes to its target, flowing into the girl's ears, jumping over the rest of her body in a hurry.
A thousand years later, her trembling fingers clutch onto her only possession, the sole book she has not read. She economizes reading, one word per day, looking behind her every second, paranoid that the dragon's tongue will again slither around her ear and pour more ink into it, ruining this book too.
But no, the dragon has better plans and leaves her with the unread copy of the latest john green book, ""hot and smart chicks with an attitude"". He watches as she struggles reading each para, sucking each word dry of meaning, trying to find patterns where there are none, fabricating metaphors ""hidden"" in descriptions of dirty underwear,  throwing a hundred glances to every curve of times new roman ""maybe it has an inner meaning"", she asks herself, overcome by hopelessness.
She tries to read something else, something that had some meaning before she knew all about it, maybe some poetry?, but the verses stare at her, a horde of familiar face. ""Move on"", they say as she struggles to find more depth than there is, diving head first into the pool of curiosity only to find that the waters of enlightenment have been pumped out.
She hits a wall of predictable endings at the shallow bottom.
She turns, clutching her broken face as her fractured nose gushes blood and half drowns her to death, murdered by her own knowledge. She  looks up and sees the dragon soaring high above her and shouts, with all the will she can muster,
""HELP ME!""
The dragon glances down at her, stuck in a carnivorous hole of self-pity and despair dug by a man named comprehension.
He whispers,
""No"".

A short story I had to right for school,litemeonfire,1,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/17nmpx/an_eventful_day_a_short_story_i_had_to_right_for/,"	The air was thick with fog (for it rained heavily for five days straight and was heating up fast), the no longer small river was bubbling, there was the smell of pine in the air, and Hadvar is standing by the river Conar practicing his elemental spells (mainly Thunder-shock) trying to strike down a big pike that he Conjured. Hadvar kept trying to blast the pike but he kept missing, so getting very angry he slung his arms down and accidentally Shifted the rock ledge he was standing on. 
	“Oh dear god!” shouted Hadvar, as the ledge fell into the water. The water rushed Hadvar further and further away from his way home. He was pulled under water, jostled and bruised, and sent over three foot water falls before he floated to the shore. When he arrived ashore he estimated that he had been in the water for over an hour as he gathered logs for a fire. He was almost frozen by the time he had gathered and set up a large amount of logs, so he wasted no time at all and used a Quickdry spell on his self and Firespark spell on the logs. After he warmed up by the fire his stomach started to ache from hunger, being smart he Conjured roasted rabbit and baked potatoes and threw them on a flat rock that he found on top of some of the coals. 
	When he finished eating he Conjured a sleeping bag and managed to sleep for a few hours until there was a loud crunch. Hadvar awoke with a jolt and got out of his sleeping bag ready to blast what ever it was with a    Thunder-shock.
	“Hahahahaha you think your puny spell can harm me?” asked a voice from the darkness.
	“Show yourself!” Yelled Hadvar. “Or are you scared?!”
	“Me? Scared by a little punk like you. Ha!” Said the voice with a quiver of anger as he appeared.
	The man was utterly repulsive he even made Hadvar cringe. His face and body was covered in scars and his right eye was as black as a cave and his left eye was blood red. He was at least seven foot tall and his muscles were HUGE.
	“What is with all the scars?” Asked Hadvar.
	“There for every person I’ve killed.” laughed the guy.
	“Your name?” Asked Hadvar.
	“Jones, Killer Jones.” said Jones. “Now are you going to fight and die or just die?”
	      “I think I’ll take my chances and fight you!” yelled Hadvar nervously.
	“Hahahahahaha your funeral rat!” laughed Jones.
Hadvar blasted a Thunder-shock at Jones, but at the last possible second Jones dove out of the way and Threw Hadvar into a tree. 
	“This guy is good. I need a new tactic.” thought Hadvar.
Hadvar made a Shield-dome and watched Jones to look for any weaknesses. Hadvar Shifted the ground beneath Jones. There it was, a weakness, Jones can't turn very fast and his left leg is weaker than his right! 
	Hadvar quickly devised a plan, it was crazy but nonetheless a plan. He jumped out of his Shield-dome and used a spell that he was working on, called Element-storm. The spell burnt, shocked, froze, and threw Jones all at the same time. Once Jones was off balance Hadvar Shifted the ground to throw Jones to the ground and blasted Jones with a Thunder-shock. Poof! Jones turned into black smoke and faded into the ground.
	“That is so weird.” Hadvar did a Present-life spell. “No trace of any thing his size or smaller.”
Hadvar did a Teleport spell that popped into his head and found him self back home, in his living-room in fact. He did a Clean and a Change-clothes spell and went to go to sleep.

______________________________________________________

The timing was terrible. It was as dark as the night could have possibly gotten and here she was, venturing through it. There were few others on the road this time of night and this only aided in her growing paranoia. It had been only minutes since she left the party, but she already regretted leaving a populated place. Then again, how does someone get out of her current situation?

""Oh hey, I've been seeing things lately, mind if I just live here for now on?""

She shook her head and tried to force laughter into the uneasy silence in her car. The interstate was bare of any other car but her own and the lights on the dashboard provided little light to the interior. 

The deepening pit in her gut was growing intensely, she knew the 'thing' was there. Just in her peripheral she could see it taking shape in the passenger seat. She was used to seeing strange things and had grown up seeing a ghost dog nearly every day. It had never occurred to her that these were entities to fear. As long as they stayed in her peripheral vision then she could be happy and so were they. She had gone years pretending that she didn't see a strange thing in a photograph or in the mirror. That the things that walked past her peripheral were just tricks of the light. 

This new intruder, however, had been persistent. It appeared in her peripheral and stayed there, unmoving as if testing her will. As it took form now, it had to have known that she would not be able to resist. Its body seemingly solidified next to her and sat patiently as her dark passenger. 

By now her heart was attempting to escape from the tomb that was her body. Slowly, through the lenses of her glasses she turned to look at her passenger. It was everything she thought it would be. She took a moment to curse her glasses, regretting the ability to see it so clearly. The thing had hot coals for eyes and stared at her. The gaze that burned into her clearly said ""I know you"". Its eyes were unfeeling, bright coals of light in a figure that could have easily passed for a man if it had any features that were human. In her passenger seat, it was just a black shadow with burning eyes. 

She could taste blood in her mouth and realized that she had been screaming.  Even if she had to yell for help her voice was choking in her throat. She realized then that she broke a fatal unspoken law. You are never supposed to acknowledge the unnatural. The moment its given the time of day of your full glance, then it knows. Air had escaped from the car and she could feel a tightening sensation around her throat. Impulsively she stopped the car and struggled with the door. She was welcomed with the cool rain but still struggled to free herself from her seatbelt. 

In a heap she fell to the ground, struggling to crawl but the tugging at her throat limited her to the ground. A warm shameful puddle began to form underneath her but her fear didn't dissipate, the eyes were still on her. She prayed for anyone, anything, she wouldn't have minded if a car hit her right now. Quickly she looked around to see if anyone had noticed her predicament.  As she turned to face her passenger it had disappeared. The interior lights exposed the inside of the car as it should have been. Empty. No mysterious passenger, there was nothing. The night was entirely silent besides the door open bell sound the car was making. 

She sat quietly in the cold rain, her puddle of shame cooling underneath her and her hair sticking to the sides of her head. She realized then that she had been pulling on her scarf the entire time and it took great concentration to free her fingers from around it. Her heart had calmed, having failed to free itself from her. Warm tears flooded her face, she could sit there all night but knew it wouldnt be the last time she saw it.

This is the opening sequence for a potentially very dark comedy I'm writing about extreme masochism. An extrovert and an introvert share a prison cell. One has a ridiculously extreme fetish whereas the other, well, we don't really know what his deal is. Tension builds, etc., etc., and certain frustrations are vented, etc., etc.

Other than that, enjoy and please critique!***

**It was time**. He knew it was time, but he didn't want to believe     it. The supermarket was filled to the brim with unattractive  soccer moms who, in his mind, were pathetic enough as him to at least have a shot at bedding them. Jeremy, you see, was about to shit  his pants. As the thought of possibly losing a large amount of prospective breeding partners, Jeremy thought. He gripped the handle of his  shopping cart ever tighter and used just enough brain power to think without forcing the brown mudslide onto his new, relatively good  looking Ralph Lauren khakis.

He'd bought them just for this occasion, Jeremy was on the prowl. Jeremy, a fresh faced 32 year old virgin was going to lose his  membership to never-fuck incorporated today and just do it. 'I'm Charming', he thought, shortly before leaving, lying to himself that he  would be able to even have a 3 minute conversation with another woman without shooting failure-juice into his batman underoos. To  help prevent this, Jeremy masturbated 3 times before mutsuring up the courage to make the long, silent drive to the Safeway to find his  companion. One of these times was in his car, sobbing, in the parking lot of an Adult Vocational School. He wiped his shame onto a  Burger King wrapper and kept driving. He'd halfheartedly considered simply ordering a prostitute, but ultimately decided against it. The  entre process seemed to lack dignity to him. Then again, it seemed like a decent alternative because, of course, Jeremy was about to shit  his pants.

Jeremy loosened his grip on the shopping cart handles and began to pace around the dairy section of the supermarket  nervously. The cool air of the always opened refridgerators kept him calm for the moment, but the ever building pressure in Jeremy's  colon simply couldn't be ignored. He kept thinking. 'Bathroom'. 'I need to find a bathroom'.  He scanned up and down the aisles near him  hoping to find a sales asociate to point him into the right direction. As his eyes met a short, old woman customer on the opposite end of  the 60 something foot aisle, he felt it. Jeremy was turtling.  Jeremy began to panic, grasping his belly like an aspiring rapper who'd been  shot after stepping on someones shoes on the bus. The stress of thinking about this terrible analogy only forced the log farther out of  Jeremys unslightly hairy anus, and a small pointed crease in the fabric under his testicles began to form.

 The panic was in full force, but through the red midst of uncertainty Jeremy was able to devise a simple plan. Make your way  out of the store as fast as possible and shit yourself in the parking lot where less people are around. This plan would have saved Jeremy  a lot of frustration and embarassment -- had it worked.  During the fourth step in his horse like gallop towards the exit of the Safeway, a  very unbecoming turd found itself on the outide of Jeremy's anus. The kind of turd that a Turd Mother would tell other Turd Parents is  adorable, and they would agree politely, but both parties knew the truth. The turd was followed with a 'hurumph', the sound that would  expect a 1700s french musical horn to make while malfunctioning. 

It was at this point that Jeremy lost his sense of civility and normalcy. Jeremy was forty feet away from the exit and several  dozen people were milling about him, making their ways towards check out lines and staring slack jawed at the convenience items that  lay before them. The realization that no one noticed the unfortunate shitting of his pants made Jeremy feel like a hero. The sort of hero  that doesn't solve crimes, but the sort of everyday hero that had terribly embarassing events happen to them and was able to subersively  circumvent any public attention. Jeremy of course didn't know what the word 'hero' meant, in fact he was illiterate. Though, the idea of  him being a hero still excited him.  It excited him to the point that Jeremy became aroused, and the force of his erection pushed the stool  further out of his anus until it was fully relinquished, at which point a stream of warm diarreah leaked out of his trousers and onto his  striped spiderman socks and birkenstocks. 

But even during this embarassing period, Jeremy felt invincible. He casually put one foot against the AA battery stand behind  him and leant backwards. A cool smirk crept across Jeremy's face, not noticing the small stream of diarreah spilling out of his pantleg  and onto the linoleum tiling. 'So, Obama huh?' he remarked to no one in particular, forming a peice of tissue from his pocket into the  shape of a toothpick, which he unsuccessfully used to pick his teeth. 'Some kinda president that guy is. Unemployment at 20% and he says  the economys in great shape. HAH!' He locked eyes with one of the more atractive brunette soccer moms. ""But he's a pretty cool president  I guess."" he said, extending his arm. ""Jeremy. Jeremy Fedder at your service"" Jeremy contemplated winking at the woman, but before  making that decision the womans face had already recoiled in stunned horror at the amount of dripping feces on the mans hand. 

She then noticed the throbbing, shit covered mass in the mans trousers and placed her hand over her mouth. What could she  do? What should she do? She did the only thing she felt was natural and appropiate for the situation. ""RAPE!!!"" she screamed at the top  of her lungs, darting towards the exit. The dozens of customers then fixed their eyes entirely on Jeremy, and various forms of shock and  embarassment crept on their faces. Many of them politely looked away, while others moved out of the way. Jeremy was baffled, he was  charming, midly attractive, and confident enough to poop his pants in a supermarket while not feeling self conscious.

Jeremy then made the poor decision to follow after the woman. ""WAIT! I HAVE MORE INTERESTING ANECDOTES LADY!"" Jeremy remarked,  hobbling over towards the exit. Each step forced more and more shit out of the mans shitter (AUTHOR'S NOTE: I ran out of synonyms.) and  soon he was limping towards her as one shoe became substantially heavier than the other. The odour wasn't at all unpleasant to Jeremy,  but to others in the Market it was unbearable. Most turned away, but one particularly weak stomached man vomited once he saw and  smelled the sensation that was Jeremy and his poopy pants.

Though it is my first time writing historical fiction, I believe in it so much that I have posted a research project for it on Kickstarter.  This excerpt describes an American Wake: the party/mourning of dear ones leaving Ireland for America.  The idea at the time was that once people left, it was if they had died because traveling to and from America was so expensive--it was almost a guarantee that you would never see your loved ones again.  
The family in this story consists of Patrick and Margaret Kelly and their children: Anne, Kathleen, Michael and Elizabeth.  Please let me know what you think and forgive any formatting errors, I'm still a bit new to reddit.

Friends and neighbors packed into the Kelly house.  The fiddle strings sung as people danced and drank.  The whiskey bottles passed from person to person, everyone enjoying a top up at their leisure.  Mary Anne and Elizabeth both swung around the room with their partners enjoying the night. 
Kathleen took the bottle from Collin Bourke and refilled her glass.  “Slainte,” she toasted smiling.  She made her way over to her brother Michael and poured him a wee bit.  “You look like a cart just ran over your pup, Mickey.”
“So I’m spost to be happy you’re leaving then?” He replied.
“No, but you are supposed to be happy that I’m your sister and you love me.”
Michael’s frown was not lifted by his sister’s words.
“Come on then.  At least give us a dance,” she smiled.
“Oh no, Kitty.  I’m no good at dancing!”
His protests were in vain as she pulled him into the dance.  There he had no choice but to follow along, lest he be knocked over.
And so the party continued until the fiddle slowed and the funeral song was played.  Around the room faces grew dismal.  Margaret struggled to keep herself from bursting into tears.  The whiskey gave most people strength as ‘The Parting Glass’ was played somberly.  Anne and Kathleen took their cue and picked up their bags.  Their parents stood waiting by the doorway.   
The girls led the gathering through the door into the street.  The queue proceeded down the road to the train station, many people stopping by their houses to watch the too familiar scene unfold once more.
Pat Kelly looked worn and tired, much older than he had before the dancing had ceased. It nearly broke Kitty’s heart to see her father this way.  She dropped her bags and wrapped her arms around his neck.
“I’ll miss you Papa,” she choked.
She heard no reply but warm tears from her father’s eyes.  He nodded in agreement and gestured her towards the train. Pat Kelly was not afraid to cry in front of his neighbors, nor did any of them blame him for his tears.
Anne too wept as she reassured her crying mother that they would be fine.
“You write me often, ye hear?” Maggie cried, “And make sure you find a nice Church as soon as you get there.”
Kathleen turned to little Mickey who had been silent throughout the goodbyes.
“What do you say, Mick?  Could I get a hug goodbye?”
“You will write me?” he asked.
“Of course, I will.  I’ll tell you about all the excitement in New York.” 
Michael thought hard staring at the ground.  Kathleen reached down to hug him.  She was startled as he clutched his arms around her neck fiercely.  
“I don’t want you to go,” he whispered through tears.
“I know, Mickey.  But I’ll be back someday, I promise.”
They released their embrace.
“You swear?” He stared at her intensely.
“I do,” she affirmed.
Satisfied by his sister’s pledge he backed away confidently.
“You take care of each other so,” Kathleen heard her father tell Anne.
Anne nodded as the whistle called.
They grabbed their bags hurriedly and ran to the nearest car.
Pat Kelly watched his oldest girls board the train and yelled after them, “And don’t forget from where ye came!”
Annie and Kitty leaned out and waved.  Metal ground against metal as the train pulled forward.
Pat looked down at his son.  Michael stared after the train.
“They’ll be fine lad,” he reassured the boy, hand on his shoulder.
“I know,” Michael responded, “She swore it to me.”

Kathleen watched as the platform faded away. Anne sat down opposite her sister.
“What was it you were saying to Mickey?” she asked curiously.
Still staring out of the window, Kathleen responded, “I promised him I’d come back.”
Annie could not believe her ears.  Surely she must have misheard her sister. “You promised him what?”
“I’ll come back to him,” she repeated facing Anne.
“Kitty, you know you won’t come back.  No one ever comes back,” Anne pointed out, “I can’t believe you would say such a thing to him.”
“I swore.  I’ll come back,” Kathleen reaffirmed.  She turned back to the window to watch the rolling hills.  She felt Anne’s stare but focused on memorizing the greens and browns and blacks.  She would not forget it.  She would be back.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_vc4su,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/vc4su/excerpt_from_my_historical_fiction_novel_as_eire/,

Anthony hated space travel. He’d made that clear enough to his supervisor, but, as the least senior engineer, he was volunteered for the job anyway.''


“It’ll be ok, Anthony,” Steve had told him, in a soothing voice that didn’t quite hide his smugness at having escaped the assignment, “Just take a look around, fill out the form, check a few boxes, and you’ll be back home soon.”


So here he was, bound for InterCorp Asteroid S-376, strapping himself in to the chamber where he would spend the next week. The automated intercom recording droned on and on about the process of cryogenic freezing in the background.


Anthony was one of those unfortunates that always felt sick during takeoff. Besides, suspended animation gave him the creeps – what if he didn’t wake up? What if the pilot didn’t wake up? The whole business scared him. 


He supposed it wasn’t Steve’s fault that InterCorp had managed to blow up a bunch of miners, and it wasn’t Steve’s fault that the new regulations required a working civil engineer’s signature in addition to the safety inspector’s, but he indulged a brief daydream of arm wrestling Steve into the capsule and slamming the door. 


Then the engines engaged, the chamber slid shut, Anthony almost lost control of his stomach, and the chamber flooded with the anesthetic that would keep him asleep until landing.


When he came to, he still felt sick, compounded by a groggy disorientation. The ship had apparently landed safely, since the only other passenger had already vacated his tube. Anthony followed suit, wobbling with the weakness that inevitably resulted from seven days in suspended animation.


“Sleep well?” Frank Moore, the burly, bearded safety inspector, clapped him on the back with astonishing force, considering he had just slept for a week, “It’s about time you woke up - I’ve been 
waiting. Let’s get this over with!”


Anthony muttered an apology, staggered to the curtained area next to the door of the tiny spacecraft, and began the lengthy process of removing his clothes and donning his grey suit. They were much easier to wear nowadays than the bulky, air filled carapaces of his childhood, but the tightly-wrapped compression suits made him self-conscious about his lanky frame; he always felt a little vulnerable walking around in a skin tight outfit. At least the helmet provided a measure of anonymity, he thought. 
__________________________________________

Finally, he buckled his utility belt around his hips and surrendered his earth clothes to a drawer, where they would remain until the return trip. Then he signaled the pilot, the airlock slid open, and he followed Frank out onto the surface of the InterCorp asteroid.


Vertigo struck, as it always did, at the sight of the vast, starry emptiness, devoid of protective atmosphere. He closed his eyes against the dizziness, wishing heartily that he’d stayed home. 

There was a reason he lived on earth, even though he knew the opportunities were better moon-side – give him a comforting grey sky any day! He hated stars. How anyone could choose to work all the way out here on an asteroid, when they pay wasn’t even good, was beyond him.


When the vertigo passed, he opened his eyes to see a squat vehicle with almost no clearance lumbering toward them. Its wheels spun on tracks, like government tanks, that latched onto the surface and peeled slowly off with its passage. 


As the vehicle drew closer, the passenger, a man in a silver compression suit, decorated all over with the navy blue entwined I and C of InterCorps’ logo, waved.


From what Anthony could see through the clear visor of his helmet, he didn’t look like a miner. A company man, then.


“Welcome to the InterCorp Mining Branch of InterCorp Interplanetary! My name is Naran. How can I help you today?” the man chirped into his radio mic as he skidded to a stop.


Anthony reflexively tried to jump onto the network and access Naran’s profile, but there was no response. No connection all the way out here, even. He sighed internally. Old-fashioned radio communication, no network profiles… this was going to be a taxing trip.


“It’s me,” Frank told the company man, “let’s get this over with.”


“Frank!” cried the man, enthusiastically, Anthony thought, though it was sometimes hard to tell with voices broadcasted over radio, “Glad we got to keep you. Is this the engineer?”


“Yeah. He’ll do, I think.”


“Excellent. Shall we get started?” 


Anthony thought about bridling at being talked about in the third person, but couldn’t think of anything sufficiently scathing to say, so he just nodded. 

Then he remembered that they probably couldn’t see the small motion within the helmet.


“Er, yes,” he said, blushing. At least they probably couldn’t see that, either.


“Mr. Beckler doesn’t travel much,” Frank explained. He sounded like he was about to laugh.


“I see,” Naran replied knowingly, “well, then, this should be an enriching experience. Climb in, gentlemen! Watch your step, and don’t jump too aggressively, or you might break loose.”


The vehicle turned laboriously and groaned slowly toward a small, low-ceilinged building, built from the asteroid itself. Anthony wouldn’t have known it was there except for the tell-tale silver rubber of the airlock frame.


Naran dismounted first to aid the other two. “I know the Horses must seem unbearably slow to you, Mr. Beckler, but we can’t risk guests walking around on the surface,” he explained, indicating the vehicle. “It’s too risky. Once inside, however, you may walk as you please.”


“Even an Earther gets used to it after a while, Naran,” Frank remarked, climbing down with practiced ease. 


Naran nodded in assent and gestured them to the airlock, “Of course.”


Anthony followed warily, a little put off by their attitude. Perhaps it was to be expected, since Frank had been the main inspector for Intercorp for years. Understandable that he’d be unhappy with a newcomer, Anthony supposed, but he wished they would be a little less exclusive.


He turned to wave to the pilot as they went inside; a relative had once told him that every traveler should have someone to see them off, that it would help ensure their safe return. He knew it was superstition. The pilot probably couldn’t even see him. But he always did it anyway – for luck, he thought.


Inside the office was a sparsely furnished room, with just a small desk and three chairs. In one corner, ladder rungs descended from the ceiling into a hole in the floor.


“Have to process you,” Naran said apologetically, as they all removed their helmets and clipped them to their suits, “here’s your paperwork. Frank, you know the drill.”


Frank took the paperwork, pen and clipboard disinterestedly, “Yeah, I know.”


“Mr… Beckler, was it? Here is your paperwork. It’s mostly just a formality, you understand.”


“Call me Anthony. Just a formality?”


“We at Intercorp pride ourselves on our safety record,” Naran told him, “so there won’t be any problem.”


Something about the way he said it made Anthony uneasy.


“I suppose not,” he said, hesitating.


“Of course not!” cried Frank, slapping Anthony on the back again; 
the slighter man stumbled, but Frank ignored him. “Let’s get started, Naran.”


Naran nodded assent and gestured toward the ladder. “After you, gentlemen.”",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,t3_uece5,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/uece5/asteroid_s376_excerpt_1207_words_critiques_welcome/,
