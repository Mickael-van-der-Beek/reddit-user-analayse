Let's help each other have great dreams!*

I wrote a new [noob guide to dream control](http://redd.it/rk8te) with more in-depth stabilization techniques - check it out for when you have your first LD.

And a [guide on how to do cool stuff in dream](http://redd.it/rkelb) with tips on how to summon things, fly etc.

Also if you are afraid of Monsters and Sleep Paralysis, [here](http://redd.it/t4kky) is my take on the subject inspired by [this](http://redd.it/sya2w) thread.

-------------

**Intro**

So - you have heard about this great thing called lucid dreaming (LD) where people fly around, have sex with their dream companions and can eat, drink, see anything their brains can imagine. You are in the right place, and you are in luck! You can learn to do this at will!

sit back, put some [music on](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DlHmoYP7V4) and read on...

*Beginner Techniques - Having your first lucid*

First of all, relax and forget all the horror stories. This is a completely different take that does not involve going through the dreaded Sleep Paralysis...

The easiest way to get lucid in a dream is while you are dreaming naturally. What happens is that at one point during your dream you wonder if you are sleeping. If you can *prove* to your brain that this is the case then you become lucid. But how do you prove it?

**Reality Checks**

RCs are tests you can do quickly of which the outcome is so hardly ingrained in your brain that you will instantly know if they fail. Surprisingly your sleeping brain cannot recreate the real behaviour.

Things that **work**

* Count your fingers (it's hard to focus and count in the dream.)

* Push your finger through the palm of your hand. ([yes!](http://aluciddreamerslife.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/fingerthrupalm.jpg))

* Hold your nose shut and take a deep breath.

* Try to read anything or tell the time from a watch 


Things that **don't work**

* Ask someone (try it in real life - you will get the same response)

* Pinch yourself (you can feel pain in dreams if you are not lucid)

* Turn lights on and off (sometimes works but not consistent)

**But I don't normally count my fingers!**

One of the problems with reality checks is that they are not things that you would normally do during daytime, and so you almost never do them during your sleep. How often do you really **question reality** in everyday life and do a RC? Maybe you should do more often...

* do a RC every-time you talk to someone during the day

* do a RC every-time you pass through a door

* do a RC every-time someone calls you


The idea is to create a reflex in your brain. Door -&gt; look at hand -&gt; question reality. Pick the one you like best (I prefer looking at my hand and counting fingers) and do it a few times during the day. Think of LDing while you do.

**Priming your Sub-conscious**

Your sub-conscious brain is what governs your non-lucid dreams. If your sub-conscious wants you to LD then it will present you with huge dream signs to try and tell you that you are dreaming. Dream characters will tell you so! This **combined with Reality Checks** is the best way to induce LDs.

How can you make your sub-conscious more friendly? Every person knows themselves best but some techniques that may work are strong affirmations ""I will LD tonight!"" repeated as you fall asleep, meditation, self-hypnosis, and one of my favourites ""visualization"".

**Visualization (Dream Incubation)**

Do you daydream? You should!

So daydream during the day about a place you want to be in your sleep. Make it very specific, draw the outline in your brain, the texture of the things there, the smells, the sounds. Close your eyes and fantasize about it. Don't put any other people in the scene. Imagine only a place. Do this as often as you can during the day. Don't talk about it, just imagine how it will be without words in your mind. Dwell on the feelings it gives you. Open your eyes and do a RC!

So before you go to bed, visualize your good place as much as you can while you are falling asleep. There is a good chance that you will find yourself there at some point in your dream! Do a Reality Check!!!

**Stabilizing**

You did a reality check and you are dreaming, it feels like a membrane was lifted from your eyes and you can see and hear super-sharply, you are somewhere.

If it's your first time you can get really agitated and anxious/happy and the dream will start dissolving. Rub your hands together! Calm down, it's all there for you, you can stay here for as long as you want. The only thing you need to do is **remember you are dreaming**.

Rubbing hands stabilizes. Touching things and savouring their texture stabilizes. Tasting things stabilizes. If the dream is really dissolving spin fast around your self for a couple of times. This should also stabilize the dream.

**Outro**

So remember: **REALITY CHECKS** throughout the day (pick one and do it, I like counting fingers), **VISUALIZE** your dreamscape, **STABILIZE** as soon as you attain lucidity

Happy dreaming.

**PS**:You go to sleep normally! Don't fight sleep, or try to induce Sleep Paralysis or anything like that. That is a completely different family of techniques... a lot of new people find all this hard to believe and try to go WILDing first. I don't think that is the way to go for a beginner. However here is [a small guide I made on WILDs](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/rfh5h/tips_for_wild/)

**PPS**: So this tutorial helped me break a dry spell! Read about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/rhf3i/tutorial_induced_lucid_dream_funny/) if interested...

[Kickstarter link](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1047510073/remee-the-rem-enhancing-lucid-dreaming-mask)

What's up, /r/LucidDreaming! We're incredibly excited to tell you that we've finally finished the project we've been working on for a while now. We're two redditors { [helpingfriendlybook](http://www.reddit.com/user/helpingfriendlybook) and [grumblebeard](http://www.reddit.com/user/helpingfriendlybook/) } from Brooklyn who have been friends since high school and lucid dreamers since childhood - but neither of us knew the other was interested until a chance conversation around a campfire 2 years ago. We talked a bunch about different lucid dreams we've had through the years, and tips/methods. The conversation ultimately moved into a discussion about lucid dreaming masks - their potential benefits, but mostly their problems. Some were big and clunky, most were hard to use, and all were unreasonably expensive. It was from this conversation that Remee was born - a comfortable, affordable lucid dreaming mask. Here's what we'd love for you to know about Remee:


* It's comfortable. We wanted to make the experience of wearing Remee while you sleep as pleasant as possible - unencumbered by extra buttons and controls, with thin, low profile electronics and a coin cell battery you'd never know was in there.

* It's customizable. 6 high quality LEDs run across the back of Remee, allowing for the possibility of lots of interesting and easily recognizable patterns to play while you sleep. Additionally, thanks to our Bitbanging technology, all options for light patterns and timing are set using a web app rather than clumsily handled by on-board buttons and controls. (This is one of the coolest things about the mask - watch the video for a demo of bitbanging your settings!)

* It's hackable. Remee is fully compatible with the Arduino IDE. If you're so inclined, you'll be able to load whatever code you like on Remee and we'll be sure to create a tutorial to show you how. We are working on a simple way to hook an ISP to the board with no soldering or messy wires too.

* It can look however you like. The base model comes in 5 colors that we agonized over for weeks before finally flipping a coin, then throwing them all out and picking 5 new colors that we love. There's also 3 printed with NASA hubble imagery (we're space nerds, sorry). Even better, using a really cool process called [dye sublimation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye-sublimation_printer#Textiles), you can have basically any image you want printed to the front of your Remee, high quality, without fear of peeling or fading.

* It's obtainable. The number one turn off of the older style lucid dreaming masks is the price - often $500 or more. We're kickstarting Remee at $80 for the base model. The NASA ones are $100, and the custom choice is $140.

All in all, this represents a year or so of hard work for both of us and we're incredibly proud of what we created. We've tested these suckers out and both seen a marked increase in our number of lucid dreams (we'd be happy to talk about that more if you guys are interested), and we're really happy with the way they look and feel. More importantly, we're psyched about the prospect of bringing lucid dreaming to a larger group of people. We think it's pretty dumb that something so profound, so useful, so *fun*, is something a lot of us would be embarrassed to bring up in mixed company. We're happy to answer any questions you have below, and hope you'll support our kickstarter

Edit: A word about Kickstarter, for those of you who aren't familiar with it. By pledging support, you contribute towards a project's funding goal. If it doesn't fund you don't pay anything! No worries there.

I didn't feel the whole flying thing this time. This girl that i had just barely acknowledged a couple times (she is very attractive) in one of my classes was in this dream. i thought hell, here we go lets make this count. I don't remember what really happened, i just remember having a conversation and laughing and walking holding hands on a beach. Since i was aware of the LD, i just went in and kissed her and forced myself to have one of my very few erotic dreams. I woke up midway through and just this intense feeling engulfed my body. I had never said a word to this girl in real life, yet alone thought about her ever. Now here i was feeling like i have known her forever and have history with her. I felt like i was in love. I thought about this for days, and around 2 weeks ago i balled up and talked to her, turns out she is extremely nice, my type, and very funny. We went out several times from everything to restaurants and movies, and have texted and talked nonstop. We even walked on the beach at night, which was my internal breaking point for extreme happiness. I feel like i could actually be in love. I don't plan on telling her about the dream. I don't know what the fuck happened, but this dream has brought me out into a confidence level beyond anything imaginable and has made me happier than i ever have been just because that feeling of having what you want. In a way, my LD has brought my dreams into reality. So i'm just here to share this amazing experience; and how powerful lucid dreaming and your mind can be. Its almost unreal.

*TL;DR: Next time you LD, use it, don't waste it. It brought someone new to my life and is making me fall in love. it changed my life.*

I got it from the book 'Exploring the world of Lucid Dreaming'. 

It's a very easy technique, I think the reason it works so well is because it is so simple. I've tried it 9 nights in total and I've had 10 lucid dreams in total those nights.

This is what you have to do: 
1. You go to sleep and set your alarm to wake you 4.5 hours after your estimated time of falling asleep. 
The hardest part for me is actually waking from the alarm so I recommend maybe more than one alarm. Once you are awake, you will have to remain awake for at least 30 minutes (I usually do 60 minutes). You will be tired and if you lie down you will probably fall asleep very quickly so it's best to just keep standing. That way you are sure not to fall asleep.

Just go downstairs for a bit, drink some water and go to the toilet. I also do stretching excercies and meditate, it helps me relax. Try not to get too active or do anything that might really wake you up. It's hard to explain but your mind has to be between drowsy and awake. Take your dream-journal or some paper and a pen with you. This is where the 'intention' part comes in. 

2. Write down what you want (You want to lucid dream, but also what you want to do in your lucid dream) to do and why you want to do it. Also explain the technique in short. Do it like you try to say something to your subconscious/dream mind. (Short example: I just woke after 4.5 hours of sleep, now I'm going to lucid dream. By looking for dreamsigns really well I will recognize when I am in a dream. I will have at least 1 lucid dream and will remember 3 dreams.) I don't want you to simply copy this sentence exactly, you need to write down what YOU are going to do and how you are going to do it. The more details you can add the better. You can also add how you will recognize you are dreaming.

If you want to increase your chances even higher with this technique, you should try to be aware of your state the whole time you are awake. So just keep doing reality checks and making sure you are awake. You can also visualize yourself in a dream finding out you are dreaming. Visualize what you would like to do.

3. After being awake for at least 30 minutes and writing your intention down, you go back to sleep. 
Don't worry about not being able to fall asleep after so long (unless you have a lot of trouble sleeping, then you should probably not try this technique). I usually fall asleep within a few minutes after I'm in bed again.

I hope this works as well for all you guys as for me.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_wsb01,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/wsb01/a_technique_that_has_worked_100_of_the_time_for_me/,

However, if you are planning to become a lucid dreamer and are willing to work for it. Here you go. These are the three things that will get you there. These three things by themselves, followed religiously will get you lucid. (Though don't hesitate to read the other stuff in the sidebar.)

1. **Begin keeping a dream journal**. Any time you wake up, at night or in the morning, write down what you remember. At night a sentence often stimulates enough memory to remember more in the morning. Record things that occur often. These will be your **dream signs**. Goal: Remember 1 or 2 dreams each night.

2. **Begin doing reality checks**. Do these *24 hours a day*. (Yes. Especially while you are sleeping.) 30 or more should be enough. [Really, really question your state](https://infinitynow.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/portrait-of-salvador-dali-1954.jpg). 

3. **Begin practicing MILD**. Before you go to bed, tell yourself that you intend to remember that you are dreaming while in your dream. *Every time* you wake up at night, remember a dream you have had or just had. Pick one in which a dream-sign appears. (This is one of the reasons your use a dream journal.) Remind yourself again that you intend to remember that are dreaming while in your dream. In the visualization, see yourself in the dream you picked noticing the dream-sign. Upon noticing the dream sign, do a reality check. See yourself becoming lucid. Then continue visualizing what you plan to do once you become lucid. Condition yourself this way so that you expect it to happen and the training kicks in as automatically as catching a line drive and throwing it to second base when there is a guy on first, 'cause you don't want to miss a double play like last time. And the pitcher is Jeff from fourth grade but he is still 10 years old. That's weird. Note: This is best done in the early morning when you wake up. 

4. Continue to do the above things until you have success--this is the method in which most beginners have success. 

Begin 1 and 2 simultaneously. Once You have reached remembering 1 or 2 dreams each night and have pulled out some good *dream signs* from your journal, start 3. 

*While you are doing the above things, read as much as you can from the links on the sidebar. 

*Do not decide that you can skip one of the steps or part of a step.  That is  the quickest way to fail. 

**Notice that there is nothing above about WILD. That is because WILD is best done *after* you have experience with becoming lucid. For several reasons. The biggest reason is that during sleep paralysis, you may have a false awakening in which boogie men or women (and very, *very* occasionally Capt. Jack Harkness) come and frighten you while you are paralyzed.

I am still not entirely convinced this is a good idea, but it's worth a shot I guess.**

**EDIT 5 - I have added a new post on the blog about visualizations as a start to help people with lucid dreaming, I will be following this up with more information and am interested in your feedback**

**I recently discovered this subreddit and saw a lot of people having trouble achieving lucid dreaming, I have been able to do this from a very young age. So after talking to my mother to piece together how I learned how to do this, I typed this up, I hope it helps some of you.**

*A few notes before I begin my story, or else it really won't make any sense, I have autism (Asperger Syndrome to be exact), but it only got diagnosed when I was 14-15,  but for most of my childhood I was just diagnosed as “eccentric”.
My mother is also a therapist (specializing in addiction).*

Anyway on to the story, it begins as I am a wee little boy of 3 years and I was haunted by regular nightmares. In my dreams I was constantly assaulted by various enemies (ranging from shadow people to dog-sized maggots to mutated wildlife), disasters (black holes to earthquakes to disease) and other various dangers (like mushroom spores that sprout on flesh, consuming you alive), to this day I still remember most of them.

As a baby and a small child, I always was a light and short sleeper, but as I started to fear the nightmares more and more, I stopped sleeping almost all together, all energy drained away. At first my parents though I was sick and took me to the doctor a couple of times until they finally realized I had stopped sleeping. My sleeping pattern before that was mostly hidden catnaps during the day, so it took a while for my parents to find the problem.
After some questioning from my mother the truth finally came out about my nightmares and having some knowledge of psychology she suggested my teddy polar bear would protect me. According to her I instantly rejected this suggestion, clearly understanding the difference between dreams and reality.
At this point she grabbed an old fable (we both couldn't figure out which one it was) about a hero, he was given a shield and told that if he believed his shield would protect it would and a sword that would cut anything he believed he could cut.
As you might suspect the young hero slayed a few dragons and killed a few monster until he came upon an evil witch who cast doubt in his heart, telling him that he couldn't trust his blade and sword as they were only as strong as his belief and what would happen if he ever doubted.
Of course this made the hero doubt and die a useless death against the witch's monster.
After this I commented the hero was stupid, if he believed his weaponry could do it, it could, so there was no reason for doubt. My mother quickly batted it back, by telling me that I was stupid as well, because I refused to believe in the power of my teddy bear.
This clicked well and next time I fell asleep, my polar bear was there and protected me from all harm. This went on for a few nights and I started to encourage the bear in my dreams and suggesting to him how to slay my enemies. Slowly I started to give my bear other commands, like carrying me to various dream locales or finding certain people.

This was the start of me directing the course of my dreams, I told my bear what to do and he did it. Though I was limited in what I could do, because the bear wasn't omnipotent. Now this process took a few months and as I became older, I started to teach myself to read. Soon my dream enemies were becoming smarter and scarier as they were inspired by the tribulations and foes described in my books. So the day came there was an enemy my polar bear couldn't beat, he could only hold him in a stand still. Now during this time I was also reading Greek and Norse mythology with my mother, so I had a good idea. I told my bear to flee with me to the dwarfs where I would (with the help of the dwarfs) smith an armor and weaponry for him.

This was the first time I myself actually changed the dream directly and through time I started doing more and more. I crafted armor and a sword for myself and aided my bear in battle and soon enough I didn't even need the help of props to direct my dream, I could vanquish my enemies with a thought and do whatever I wanted, creating adventures with heroes like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, flying through the cosmos or eating enough candy to fill a large lake.

Now this was a slow process, I was about 6 when I was able to do all this, but the stress of daily life was starting to wear on me. I did not yet know about my autism, so I barreled through life trying to be as normal as possible, not realizing I was bombarding my senses with much more than they could handle. As a result of all that stress I started to act out in anger, I didn't fight other people or start making scenes in public. I would sequester myself in my room and start punching the walls and scream like a little madman.
After one day I punched a hole into my bedroom wall into the bathroom, my parents realized this wasn't just a phase I was going through and my parents tried to help me calm down.
My father taught me to take a walk when I started getting angry and my mother tried to teach my to count to ten or other such techniques. Now these approaches are valid and good ways to handle anger, they however aren't good ways to handle sensory overload, which was the cause of my stress and anger. So my anger problems only increased, until my mother finally found a way to help me calm down.
I was to control my breathing, close my eyes and imagine a happy place (I am aware it's a cliche these days, but it is a cliche for a good reason, it works). This worked wonders as this would help me close of to the outside world.
At first this happy place was merely a small rock to sit on while my feet dangled into water, but as I kept using the image, the place slowly grew. A forest was introduced, a fine mist was overlaid on the lake I hang my feet in, etc.

As I continually enforced this image in my mind, it started to show up in my dream, where I further explored the locale. I discovered a deep cave behind a waterfall, chopped down trees to create a clearing for my bear, the lake changed into the lake surrounding Avalon. I learned a lot during these dreams, I could just snap whatever I wanted into existence, but I found if I did this, it would be unstable, disappearing next time I was there, or changing each time I looked at it. Instead I made the things I want with my hands, I dreamt up an axe and cut down the clearing for my bear., using the wood I gained to build a boat to explore the lake, I wove moss into cushions and so on.

When the place by the lake was more or less finished I decided I wanted to do more, I also was increasingly interested in psychology, because all these techniques my mother taught me made me a much happier person.
So I began reading psychology books my mother had laying around, now I didn't understand anything, but some things did become clear to me. Like the concept of a subconscious and how it interacted with dreams. Inspired by this and realizing my control of my dreams gave me a unique opportunity to study my own subconscious, I got to work.

Please read this post.",Theon,688,85,390,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/qn3ss/greetings_new_users_please_read_this_post/,"We're very happy to welcome new [oneironauts](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oneironaut) on-board, but please, take your time to read through this post, it'll help make the subreddit better.

First off, there's been some disagreement on the matter of memes, so for now we decided to put them in a separate subreddit (/r/luciddreamingmemes), and we'll remove any that appear here - there are numerous reasons for that, most of them have been summed up in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/qmlts/ban_memes_in_rluciddreaming/).

And now to the fun stuff! So you just found out about lucid dreaming, either from a friend, or from a random image on the web, and you'd like to try it. Good news, we've been collecting good sources of information in the sidebar, so if you have any questions, or you'd like any help, refer to these guides first - that's not to mean you should be afraid to ask questions, quite the opposite! Just that there's a lot of dangerous misconceptions going on (even in threads on /r/LucidDreaming, unfortunately), and these guides are a great source of information.

So, how to get into this lucid dreaming stuff, you ask? You might have found out about some techniques already, but in my experience, they were mostly just rehashed or mangled versions of existing techniques, so again, please rather read the guides than a random image you found. Lucid dreaming is an activity that's usually associated with mysticism and the paranormal, but it's actually a quite well researched scientifically sound phenomenon, and there's nothing dangerous about it - or about lucid dreaming itself, that is. Some people are afraid of sleep paralysis (which I'll get to later), or getting addicted to it, or falling in a coma and not waking up - that's nonsense, lucid dreaming is just dreaming when you're aware, nothing really strange about it, a lot of people have experienced a lucid dream even before they knew anything about lucid dreaming.

But for those who haven't and would like to try it (such as myself and majority of people, I expect), there is a lot of techniques and aids, most popular are:

* Dream Journal

It's a notebook where you take down what you remember from dreams - it helps to improve dream recall, and overall lucidity, and it's really fun to read what you've written being ""sleep-drunk"". (""An omniscient banana-axe?!"") Also, one important thing: You dream every time you fall asleep, usually about six or seven dreams. You just forget it *really* quickly, one time I managed to forgeteverything but the number ""3"" before I got from bed to my table to write it down (the lesson: have your Dream Journal by yourself when you wake up).

* Reality checks

These are pretty much essential, you really need them to realize you're dreaming. Some of them include looking at your hands and counting your fingers (that's where our subreddit's logo comes from), breathing with your nose shut, reading text, waiting and then checking if it changes...

### Techniques

 [WILD](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lucid_Dreaming/Induction_Techniques#WILD)

The gist of this one is going to sleep, but staying mentally awake while your body falls asleep. It requires you to go through the whole ""falling asleep consciously"" business, so it's not for the faint of heart (and certainly not ""your first LD technique""), and more often than not, you find yourself in sleep paralysis. Sleep paralysis is something that happens every time you fall asleep, and it happens when your brain severs the connection to your muscles, so you don't act out what you're doing in your dreams (and knowing why you guys want to try lucid dreaming, this wouldn't end up good, teehee). You basically wake up, open your eyes, but you're unable to move. Scary stuff. However, sleep paralysis is entirely safe (it does happen every night, after all), and it isn't really even scary when you know what's happening.

Anyway, this method is very popular, since it's basically ""lucid dreams on command"", and it's immensely interesting, but it's just very hard. That's not to drive you away from it, just expect to fail often, and it takes often weeks until your first successful LD.

[MILD](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lucid_Dreaming/Induction_Techniques#MILD)

Before you go to bed, you just think ""I'm going to sleep, look at my hands, and realize I'm dreaming. I'm going to sleep, look at my hands..."" It's a beginner method, but it's not as effective as WILD - still, this is probably the way to go if you're just starting out.

This method also includes doing reality checks - you associate something (opening a door, meeting a person, whatever) with doing a reality check, and you do a lot of reality checks during the day. The idea is that this will then carry over into your dreams, you'll do a reality check in your sleep and realize you're dreaming.

(Notice that I didn't say anything about drugs that should help with Lucid Dreaming - simply, don't do drugs, kids. They often don't help, or alter the dream in a bad way - and it all relies on your mind and these techniques anyway, so you're probably better off without them. Oh, and weed often makes people don't have/remember any dreams, so that's likely out too.)

So, you're lucid dreaming, what now? Well, you can do anything! But if you still don't know what to do, here are some tips: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lucid_Dreaming/Using#What_you_can_do

After all my childhood and teenage years spent lucid dreaming, I eventually came to an unexpected conclusion: **living out your wildest fantasies in living detail gets old after a while**. When you wake up, you face the fact that all those sexy situations amount to masturbation. All those amazing conversations are just you talking to yourself.

You can go further. The best part is, it's simple: Do Nothing.

I mean it. Do nothing. As soon as you've stabilized yourself in your dream body using your favorite technique (I like spinning around with my arms out) resist the temptation to create some new fantasy. Instead, **ignore all people and events around you**. No matter how fascinating, intriguing, scary or repulsive the dream story gets, ignore it with calm dispassion. Cultivate this mindset: You are the dreamer. Nothing can harm you. Nothing can distract you. **Do not get involved in any story. Do not create any story.** Story distracts and takes away your power.

People will approach you with beautiful things to look at, delicious foods to taste, dangerous weapons to murder you with, or eyes to fall in love with. Pay them no mind.

**Sit down calmly wherever you are and absorb yourself in the most mundane details of the environment.** Reach out and run your fingers over the ground. Feel how real it is. Notice how you can feel every tendon in your hand as you touch it. Bang on it. Notice how the vibrations move through it in exactly the right way. If you're outside, look at the trees. Notice how they sway so gently in the wind and how the light dapples through them in exactly the right way. Listen. You'll hear birds, distant traffic, a passing jet plane. As ordinary as can be.

After a few moments of calm, detached observation of the fabric of the world around you, you'll notice that it has become utterly real. There is no dreamy fuzziness, no detectable difference between the world you're seeing and what you normally refer to as the waking world. Try your reality tests. They'll pass.

What you do at this point is up to you. Revel in the miracle of sensation. Ask the dream world pointed questions about the meaning of your life and destiny. I usually call out for my dream teacher. He shows up and gives me a new lesson about my mind, the nature of dreaming, death, or the waking universe — sometimes forcefully.

You may find it difficult to wake up from this state. Try not to be afraid. You will eventually.

Three days ago, i read about the [FILD Method] (http://www.dreamviews.com/induction-techniques/4779-finger-induced-lucid-dream-fild.html). Basically it's just about waking up after approximately 6 hours of sleep then just fall asleep again but you have to move your index and your middle finger like you are playing the piano while you are falling asleep. This should transport you directly into a lucid dream. 

First i was very sceptical about it, because it looked so ""easy"" but i thought i would give it a try. So i woke up after 6 hours of sleep and tried the method and you won't believe it but it worked straight away. By falling asleep and moving my fingers, i could see the dream world getting build up and i was right in it! I didn't need any RC's to know that i'm dreaming (even though i did them, just to be sure) and the lucid dream even lasted about 10 minutes. After waking up from this lucid dream i felt very very happy, because it worked so fast and i thought i would give it another try the next morning and voilà, it happened again. And surprisingly this very morning again. I can't really explain how this magic works, but it seems to be that it works almost every time, even for beginner! 

**TL;DR** I had three lucid dreams in three days just by using the FILD method! So try it out today and write how it worked for you!

No misinformation, just giving everyone the facts and allowing them to learn at a steady pace, working as a team, helping everyone achieve lucidity.

Even if you've had lucid dreams before, there's always a lot you can learn, and we're planning for people to be much better at attaining lucidity and controlling their dreams.

I've been wondering if I should post here or not but the dream I had was so wonderful I felt like I had to share. 

**Backstory**
My Mom and I had no real relationship for most of my life. She left my Dad when I was a baby and at 6 months old I was sent to live with my father's mother (Momo). Despite the fact that I had a strong female influence in my life I always wanted to know and love my mother. Momo just wasn't my Mom despite how hard she tried. 

I met my Mom when I was 20. I had never been so happy. She wasn't everything I imagined but fortunately I had learned through pitbull rescue that you can't always make something into what you want. You must accept and move forward. My mother was mentally ill and addicted to anything that could be addictive, despite being clean at the moment. 

When she killed herself, 1 1/2 years after I met her, I was sure I would never see or here from here again. I am an atheist and I take no comfort in the idea of heaven or anything of the like. I like to think I know better. It wasn't until I discovered lucid dreaming that I thought I could ever see her again. 

About three weeks ago I had my first lucid dream. I looked around, saw that my entire high school class was in a swimming pool, and realized I was dreaming. I thought, well, since I'm dreaming what is the thing I want most in the world?... I want to see my mom. 

So I did. She flew in on a boat no less. After she got off the boat we just hugged. She looked exactly like the last time I saw her. She was beautiful. I finally pulled away and I was crying. She looked at me, said she loved me, and I woke up.

1359412205.0,531,self.LucidDreaming,17gffp,PROPER USE OF MELATONIN (please upvote),Forevernade,778,247,141,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/17gffp/proper_use_of_melatonin_please_upvote/,"Proper use of Melatonin REALLY NEEDS TO BE IN THE FAQ!

Physiologically, high doses SCREW with your sleep. That is fine if you time it right, but everyone seems to be uninformed and unwilling to do the research before they PUT HORMONES IN THEIR BODIES and do it wrong.

Yes, Melatonin is a hormone, it isn't some fancy vitamin or amino acid, it is a hormone, and is as powerful as one in it's respective effects (think of testosterone for your sleep).

If we look at the circadian rhythm, the pineal gland produces melatonin DLMO at sundown and only peaks many hours of darkness.^1 This means when you are first going into sleep, only a small amount of melatonin is naturally in your system. This is important because while a little bit of melatonin is great for sleep induction, higher doses have a different function.

As the night continues on and you remain in darkness melatonin is produced at a higher and higher rate until maximal melatonin levels are reached in the morning around dawn. High doses of melatonin (e.g. 5mg) drastically increase REM sleep^2 (where you dream) and some other cool things which are helpful for LD. Ever wondered why you most often remember your dreams in the mornings? 

Now, if you take that large dose first thing at night before you sleep, that increase in REM is going to occur, but at the expense of a doubly important stage of sleep called SWS (Slow Wave Sleep).^3 SWS only occurs in the first 3-4 hours of your sleep and so if you destroy it with high doses of melatonin (or galantamine or anything else for that matter) then you are doing yourself a massive disfavour. 

Taking melatonin at sleep onset, you are not even going to be benefiting from it in the later hours around dawn because melatonin is metabolised very quickly and will be back to normal levels after 4-5 hours.^4

This can be applied to almost any other LD drug such as galantamine/choline too. SWS is non-cholinergic and forcing choline into your brain stops SWS, while REM is cholinergic and forcing choline into your brain will increase REM.^5

When SWS pressure is high, then you are less likely to get an intense dream, so you want low SWS pressure. You lower SWS pressure by getting a lot of SWS. If you take your dreaming drugs when your SWS pressure is high they will be less effective than if you took them when SWS pressure is low.^6

And so this is why it is important to get the timing right, because it is a hormone where timing matters! It is a circadian hormone!

So lets say you sleep for 3-4 hours, get all of your SWS out of the way and wake up for WBTB technique, then you will have low SWS pressure, and high REM pressure, take your drugs now! You will be drastically increasing your 'naturally occuring' dreams, rather than screwing around your sleep architecture.

Another option is to take an 8h timed release cap just before sleeping, this should mean a large part of the sleep disrupting dose is released after you get most of your SWS.

Now some of you will say you need melatonin to get to sleep (without taking LD into consideration) and in that case just take a 300-500ug (0.3-0.5mg) pill before you go to sleep, you will still benefit from the sleep induction effects without screwing your natural sleep architecture.^7

Do you know people with sleep apnea? They get almost no SWS and all REM and they wake up feeling like crap every morning without their machines. If you enhance the natural sleep architecture you will not only dream better in the second 4h of your night around dawn, but you will wake up more refreshed and healthier because you will have gotten lots of SWS *and* lots of REM. 

***TLDR:

Do NOT take melatonin first thing before you go to sleep. DO WBTB and take your melatonin in the middle of the night when it is naturally highest and you will benefit the most.

This can be applied to almost any other LD drug such as galantamine/choline too.***

EDIT: added a few linked citations.

citation 1

If you look at any graph of melatonin biorhythm, for example [this](http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0024320503008142-gr2.gif), [this]( http://i186.photobucket.com/albums/x256/sleepydave/biorhyth.jpg) or [this](http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0024320503008142-gr1.gif), you will see a natural rise in serum melatonin that starts with Dim Light Melatonin Onset and increases over the night up until a time between 4am and 6am when light and serum cortisol increases.

[It appears that higher doses (5mg+) of melatonin can increase REM sleep, especially during nocturnal sleep.](http://jbr.sagepub.com/content/12/6/627.full.pdf+html).

citation3

[Quantitative analysis of the EEG using fast Fourier transform revealed that 5 mg of melatonin given shortly before the daytime sleep episode results in a  suppression of slow EEG components and an increase in the frequency range of sleep spindles (Fig. 3)... the effects  on slow waves are of a  magnitude comparable to the circadian modulation and opposite to the effects of sleep deprivation.](http://jbr.sagepub.com/content/12/6/627.full.pdf+html)

citation 4

[When administered 3h before sleep onset the first REM episode was markedly lengthened (Fig. 2). However, this effect no longer was significant in the second sleep episode.](http://jbr.sagepub.com/content/12/6/627.full.pdf+html) - this tells us that we only get limited benefit from the melatonin as it is quickly metabolised within a 4-5 hour period. If taken before sleep onset it will be metabolized to below-pharmacological levels by the time we get to the second half of the night which is when our REM periods are longest and most frequent so there will be no benefit for morning-dreaming.

[For regulating the sleep cycle (preventative health before bed, jet lag, shift work, etc) doses of Melatonin between 500mcg (0.5mg) and 5mg appear to be either insignificantly different or the lower doses may work better; start with 500mcg and work up to 3-5mg and, if it doesn't work significantly better (seen in some studies, but not consistent enough for a general recommendation), return to 500mcg and use that dose.](http://examine.com/supplements/Melatonin/)",,False,,t5_2r0f4,1360916225.0,,,True,t3_17gffp,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/17gffp/proper_use_of_melatonin_please_upvote/,

You *think* you felt that - and depending on how you look at it, you perceived the time period. But you didn't experience it.

The way the brain deals with time is so awesome, and a big part of it is perceptual gap filling. When you watch a movie, and  you see a time lapse of the sun go down and then a cut to someone sleeping, you know the day ended. You also know it got dark, the person went to bed, and is now sleeping. Did you see any of this? No. Then how do you know? Well, our brains are pretty sweet/horrible in that they're really good at trying to infer things - like why our mom is using that tone we know when she finds out about something bad we did or what happened beyond those 4 seconds of time lapse sun.

We did only see those 4 seconds, but our mind effectively fills in the gaps of what happened. Similarly when you are asleep, your mind can jump from morning to evening in dream time, and your brain will go ""Ah! 'Twas morning, 'tis now night - I have experienced a day!"" when in reality you experienced perhaps 5 seconds. The kicker here is there is no way to differentiate. Your brain fills it in so well that in a dream, you can never know if you ACTUALLY experienced time passing or it was simulated. 

Ever notice how those grand sweeping epics of dreams are so damn long, but the ones where you have a sit down conversation or give a concerted effort seem to be over so quickly? Stephen Laberge scientifically proved time passes no differently in dreams than waking, so chances are it's because one is easy for your brain to perceptually fill in and the other requires you to be in cognitive real time. For a real life example, think to a school or work day. You are aware you were at work the entire day, but probably only have vivid memories of conversations or concentration-heavy activities. Your brain tosses out the unimportant stuff and fills it with fluff that solely serves to say ""Yes, you were working. It wasn't important."" Some schizophrenic patients struggle with this as their brain begins to fill gaps that aren't there; they might insist they ran out to the grocery store when they've just been sitting on the couch for half an hour. Perceptually, they can't tell.

Another more practical indicator that it's perceptual and not experiential is the lack of trauma. If you *actually* spend 600 years in a dream, fully experiencing it, you would be practically catatonic when you woke up. People who have hallucinated due to medical treatment (I personally know one) for just a few days have needed months of therapy for the shock that what they experienced wasn't real. 600 years? You'd be beyond a basket case. That's the beauty of perception. Your brain just has to trick you into thinking you did it, manufacture an odd memory here and there.

**TL;DR: 600 year dreams are not experienced, they're perceived because the brain is freaking awesome and knows how to trick itself into thinking it did something it didn't.**  

Edit: Jeez some people are emotional over this. Laberge's experiment is here: http://www.lucidity.com/slbbs/index.html. The story of my friend is below in the comments. Beyond that, I am not a psychologist or a doctor, just a lowly web developer that likes dreaming. If anyone has evidence to support or disprove my postulations (which is what all of this is; I'm not memory expert - this is what *I* think), I would certainly welcome it. Sweet dreams!

1346842444.0,462,self.LucidDreaming,zdymj,Here is a lucid dreaming exercise that you can do while awake and develop like a muscle. It will have a direct effect on dream recall and recognizing that you are in a dream. You will see improvement the day you start. ,OsakaWilson,547,85,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/zdymj/here_is_a_lucid_dreaming_exercise_that_you_can_do/,"**The ""Well, how did I get here?"" exercise**

Throughout the day, after you do an RC or instead of an RC, think back to a point in time (I do twenty minutes) and review what you did from that point up until the current time for you. It will probably consist of events (going through a tollgate), things you observed (a particularly big truck), and thoughts (""I seem to be on time, no need to speed.""). You'll be surprised how difficult it can be, especially if you were distracted. 

You'll notice, however, that after just three or four times, that you start to get better at it. When you've been doing it for several days, your brain will actually rewire itself to help you get better at it. (This is not an amazing thing, the brain rewires itself for anything you do.) The result will be that you will be giving more attentional resources to what you are doing during the day and being less on autopilot. This also makes it a great exercise for people doing ADA. 

**How does it effect dream recall?** The 'muscle' used to recall dreams when you just wake up is the same as the one you use to do this exercise. When you wake up keep your eyes closed and lay still so as not to make the tiny bit of the dream disappear. Think about that little bit that you can remember. When you do that, more and more begins to emerge. You'll be doing basically the same thing that you've been practicing during the day, but this time you'll be much more effective. 

**How does this help you become lucid?** In your dreams, noticing where you are and how you got there is a powerful reality check (nearly the only one I do these days). You may find that you have no memory of how you got there--instant lucididty. You may find you are in a weird place--instant lucidity. You may find yourself living in a shotgun shack. And you may find yourself in another part of the world. And you may tell yourself 'this is not my beautiful wife!'--instant lucidity. 

Aside from being great for lucid dreaming, strengthening this skill has been useful nearly every day in waking life, when I misplace something or when I need to return the same way I came somewhere. When people inevitably ask you what real world positive effect lucid dreaming practice has, you can throw this one at them.

1365729389.0,442,self.LucidDreaming,1c6d0a,A collection of random tips/tricks/suggestions I've learned during my 7+ years of lucid dreaming,kaeraz,549,107,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1c6d0a/a_collection_of_random_tipstrickssuggestions_ive/,"Hello. I've been lucid dreaming off and on since 2006. It started as a mild hobby after I watched the movie [Waking Life](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243017/). The more I focused on it, the easier it became and 6 months in I was having 3+ incredibly vivid and/or lucid dreams every night. 

My lucid dreaming routine has slowed down as of late, but I always know it'll be something I can come back to when I have the time and dedication (also, protip: less drinking). But during the several years when I was seriously dedicated to it, I tried a number of things to help me become lucid, extend my lucidity, enhance the realism of my dreams, as well as explore the very depths of my inner mind. 

Below is a list in no particular order. 

* To more easily transition from waking to dreaming (WILD), make sure you're in the supine position with your hands crossed in front of you. Honestly, think of yourself as a dead body in a coffin. This is the *only* way I've ever achieved WILD and works wonders for relaxing your body while keeping your position just awkward enough to keep your mind alert

* Wear socks, seriously. I have circulation problems so my feet are always freezing. It's a point of contention for a normal sleeper, but usually I could ignore it from sheer laziness and/or exhaustion. When you're trying to will your body to sleep and create a dream world in your mind, the last thing you want to think about is the frostbite forming on your toesies. 

* TALK about dreaming or lucid dreaming with a friend. Everyone can recall a good dream, even those that don't remember them that often. The more you talk about dreaming, the more it ignites that connection in your consciousness to distinguish between the waking world and the dreaming world. Sidenote: talking online and on a forum is also necessary, but I've had great success having detailed conversations *in person* with other people about dreaming. 

* Learn to meditate. So many people are gung-ho about lucid dreaming only to give up after a week, which already proves why it didn't work. Lucid dreaming takes, above all, *patience*. Meditation is a great way to learn how to focus your mind on a single thought and idea. People juggle a million things in their brains all day and to filter out everything that doesn't matter and focus on a single point is damn near impossible for some. Meditation is especially necessary for effective WILDing. 

* Bring on the B Vitamins. Particularly 6 &amp; 12. Both stimulate your brain and aid in the production of dopamine. Try falling asleep as you normally would and waking up about 6 hours later. Take a B6/B12 supplement with a glass of apple juice (helps improve memory), keep yourself awake or alert for 20-30 minutes and hop back to bed for some vivid, early morning dreams.

* Always ask your dream character for his/her name. In addition to that, ask them a million questions. I'm endlessly fascinated with the random, poignant, crazy, disgusting, weird things my brain comes up with - seemingly outside of my own control. 

* Ask your dream characters to always remind you you're dreaming next time they see you. Take this one with a grain of salt. It's worked for me twice, but I rarely see recurring characters in my dreams.

* Smoke pot (need not apply to those who don't smoke pot). I'm not advocating this right before bed. Since marijuana affects short-term memory, it's possible it's awesome at enhancing your dreams, but it's shit for allowing you to *recall* them. I recommend pot as a means to get the creative ideas flowing if they don't seem to come naturally (daydreaming without pot definitely works, too!) 

* Seriously read *every word* of [Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming](http://users.telenet.be/sterf/texts/other/exploring_the_world_of_lucid_dreaming.pdf) by Stephen LaBerge. Lucid dreamers recommend him all the time for a reason: guy knows his shit and has scientific data to back it up. 

* Reverse Blinking. This is a method I read on the DreamViews forum years ago. When you go to sleep, you count to 4 in time with your inhale/exhale while you're lying down and your eyes are closed. On 4, you open your eyes and quickly focus on a point in the room (a light, object, etc). Quickly close your eyes again and repeat the process. Could be placebo, but on nights when I'm wired and can't relax, this makes my eyes start drooping immediately. You're ready for dreamland in no time. 

* Record your dreams in present tense. Keeping a dream journal is so similar to keeping a regular journal or diary. You often record your thoughts and your day in a tense that tells you it already happened. I've found that writing in the present tense (""I'm walking down a hall"" rather than ""I walked down a hall"") helped me ""stay in the moment"" of my dream instead of losing all the details as I started to wake up more fully. 

* If you forget a part of your dream, keep writing. The plight of many LDers recording their dreams is they get hung up on not remembering a certain part and then they're sure they've lost the whole dream. Don't be afraid to jump ahead in your story and keep writing, even hazy little details. Countless times I've written paragraphs only to have to insert an arrow back in indicating that I'd remembered a whole other part of the dream.

* Incorporate your SO if he/she is willing. This is especially useful if you're going to bed at a decent hour (which you should be) and your SO is more of a night owl. Have them be your alarm clock every 90 minutes until they fall asleep. There's something endearing about your SO standing over you with your dream book and smile saying, ""What were you just doing?"" 

* To add to the above, get *plenty* of sleep (at least 6 hours) and make your sleep schedule rigid. Allow for 15 minutes to fall asleep or up to 1.5 hours if you're trying to WILD. 

* There's never a bad time to question your reality. 

* Experiment with physics while lucid. It's just cool as hell. 

* When you're passed the have-sex-as-soon-as-you're-lucid phase, start having sex *again*. But do it on Mars, on in a bungalow in underwater Atlantis. Or as a mermaid. Or as the opposite sex. Or with yourself. Or with the Indiana Colts. Or with that blue guy from Watchmen. You get the picture. 

* Learn something only in your dreams. Get really good at it and see how it compares when you try it in real life. I did this with piano with...mixed results. 

* Never ask or will for something directly. When you finally start LDing, it's easy to want more more more. With the sense of awareness comes an almost laughable sense of control. More often than not, your dream world will still develop around you without your conscious control. You're usually just along for the ride and only able to manipulate where you go and how you react. If you want to achieve something specific in a dream, find a clever way of asking for it. I wanted a gun to appear in my hands, but it wouldn't. So instead, I looked in a mirror and imagined a gun in the reflection sitting on a table behind me. I wanted to fly an airplane, but couldn't find one. So I knocked on someone's door and asked a dream character to show me where it was (her backyard, duh). Speaking of...

* Always ask for and accept dream character's help. They're essentially your subconscious trying to reconcile your normal incredulity at doing the impossible. Asking a dream character for flying lessons is much easier for your brain to accept than just taking off like Superman.

* Familiarize yourself with sensory deprivation. Whether it's using an eye masks, ear plugs, or even floating in a [dream tank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_tank), denying your senses for a bit will help you get comfortable with sleep paralysis, auditory/visual hallucinations, and other things you often experience during WILD. The more you understand this process, the less scary/weird it'll be when you're trying to get into a dream. Plus, denying one sense can increase the intensity of others, which can further enhance your lucidity. 

* Get used to often being tricked in your dreams. There have been times where I've done 3 different reality checks and have still somehow convinced myself that I'm awake and the millions of egg shells dancing on frozen Lake Michigan is perfectly normal. Look up and practice all sorts of reality checks as often as possible, but pick one above all else to do the most. Make that your go-to-definitely-a-dream RC and make it as natural as breathing. 

* Tactile sensations. They are you best friend when it comes to getting into a dream (WILD) and keeping your lucidity as well as the intensity of the dream. One of best methods I've found for ""solidifying"" a dream is to sit down somewhere and feel the ground, your skin, and how the world is interacting with your body in the dream. Basically, pretend you just took MDMA and go from there.

Possible the simplest question of all, but no one properly knows the answer. By definition, lucidity is to be conscious. Basically it's you walking, doing your thing every day. Now what happens when we stick DREAMING in front of the word? Well then we get the exciting, wraveling, and mysterious world of your brain at the palm of your hand. Lucid Dreaming is the event in which your conscious, the person you HEAR when you reason with yourself, is awake and wondering ""Why in gods name is that squirrel purple"" or in better and more practical words, that you're dreaming. Your dream is a projected world of everything your subconscious creates in order to do multiple things at the same time. Most of us aren't aware of it but every dream has a symbol, whether it's blatantly obvious or hidden in the background. This symbol ultimately tells the scheme of the dream or why it's happening. So ask, what happens then? I'm sure everyone's heard of this part. You get to screw around in your dreams making skyscrapers come out your face or fly through the solar system, but there are more practical uses to it. Lucid dreaming can enlighten you and generally make dreaming a lot funner, it's why we do it, it's why you read about it and suddenly get interested.

**How Lucid Dreaming Works**

Lucid dreaming works in a deceptively simple way. Basically, something in your dream is gonna seem a muck. You're going to be walking in a random sidewalk and the weirdest things will drive past you but it may all seem normal to you thanks to the wondrous thing we call DREAM LOGIC! Dream logic is the thing that keeps you from becoming lucid. It basically tricks your conscious in thinking everything is normal by using your subconscious' instinct to keep things in balance. What we want to accomplish in lucid dreaming is breaking that dream logic barrier and become more aware of our surroundings. There are multiple methods you can use to do this, and I'll get into that later on, but let me explain what happens when you become lucid. You're going to see something wrong, you're going to put 2 and 2 together and realize ""This isn't reality."" Your dream will begin to collapse. Everything will fade before your eyes and sounds from the real world will become a lot clearer than their occasional leaks. Now we need to prevent that. We do this by doing one of numerous things. I like to call these ""Counter Measures"" so bare with me if I refer to them as this. Below you'll have a list of things you can do :

* Hand Rubbing: You just realized you're dreaming. Now you start panicking. Collect yourself and do the simplest of all counter measures, the hand rub. Straight forward, just rub your hands together. Why is this a counter measure? Well because you get a feel of friction. When you get a feel of friction you get a feel of warmth. As many people know warmth untenses your muscles and relaxes you, and that's exactly what we want when you realize you're dreaming. You'll calm down and gain control.

* The Rinse Cycle: Or, the spin. Your arms are full in your dream or you can't move them. What do you do? You close your eyes and spin in circles! No it isn't a downs method, you really spin. Spinning blends your environment around you. When you can't see what's going on behind you your brain doesn't have to process as much information as it should. When that happens you can collect yourself.

* Staring At Your Hands: Hand rubbing isn't really working for you, you still wake up. That's okay, we have another method for you to use. Extend your hands and look down at them. Concentrate on them and try to let whatever is happening behind you not phase you. It's like the spin method, you want to calm yourself down by keeping your brain from overwhelming yourself.

* Grab Something!: You see a bottle of coke you like? Grab it! That girl in your dream have nice breasts? GRAB THEM! Grabbing things in your dream gives you a feel of what's going on and most of the time calms you down as you become more familiar with what's happening around you. It's like when you go to a party and you know everyone, you start feeling comfortable and aren't afraid or panicky. That's the feeling we want you to have, I mean after all, it's your head.

* SCREAM!: Fuck everything around you, you're excited as shit and the best way to release all that excitement and testosterone is to scream like a mother fucker. Just yell out ""I WANT TO STAY IN THIS DREAM"" with any effect you want and keep yourself on it. Although sometimes it doesn't work, it's fun as hell. I don't think I need to explain why this one keeps you from waking up, but if I do you can feel free to
tell me.

Two notes to say. The first is I've ordered each method from most effective to least. Find one that makes you comfortable and use it! Secondly, while you're doing each method what you want to do is tell yourself ""I want to remain in this dream."" Obviously you do it with the screaming method, but with the others it greatly improves your chances of staying in the dream. Remember the Triple C's as I refer to them as : Calm, Cool, and Collective.

The results were terrifying.,GoFlight1,575,170,223,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1bezvz/attempted_to_speak_with_my_subconscious_the/,"This past night was my third lucid dream. I had a lot of fun for the most part. However, as I was attempting to jump obnoxiously high, I remembered a post I'd read here about dream characters being extensions of your subconscious (or something along those lines). 

At this point, I stopped jumping around and walked over to my ""friend"" and the conversation went like this:


Me: ""Hey, are you my subconscious?""

Dream friend: ""....what?""

Me: ""This is a dream, so I just figured I'd ask.""

Dream friend: ""You're kidding right? This isn't a dream man. You're crazy."" 

*Dream friend then turns to walk away from me. I follow a few steps and reach out to grab his arm and turn him back around. My tone is now a bit frustrated*

Me: ""This IS a dream! And that means you HAVE to be part of my subconscious!""



Right as I finished my sentence my dream friend whipped back around with a horrible expression. His eyes were bigger than before and seemed to be open as wide as possible. His mouth was first hanging open and then pulled back into a grimace, similar to the look you get from your parents when they're so mad at you they can't even talk. It was similar in look, but felt different in meaning. Then his mouth just dropped open again.

At this point I was overwhelmed with a feeling that I was in the presence of something all together horrible. I was no longer standing (and therefore couldn't run), but rather had the feeling of floating just a few inches off the ground. I was terrified and didn't know what to do. Then all the light was gone. All of it, except for a sharp glow in the dream creature's eyes where his pupils should have been.

The dream creature didn't say anything else to me, but his look had meaning. And I could FEEL that meaning. It surged through me like nothing I've ever felt and all of a sudden two words rang out in my mind: GET. OUT... GET. OUT.... GET. OUT.

Now, I'm not someone who is easily scared, but at this point, I'm in full-on terrified panic mode. But I don't know how to get out. For some reason I just started shaking my head back and forth (as if shaking your head 'no') as quickly as I could. I could slowly feel myself getting sucked out of the dream so I shook my head harder and harder until I finally woke up to myself actually shaking my head in real life and drenched in sweat.

It was an altogether horrible experience.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I really have no idea what to think about it...

1335958344.0,412,self.LucidDreaming,t34ph,I had a lucid dream where I went through a course teaching how to lucid dream. I wanted to share what I learned.,Shoenbreaker,476,64,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/t34ph/i_had_a_lucid_dream_where_i_went_through_a_course/,"The other night I had an extremely vivid lucid dream where I took  a course about how to get yourself to lucid dream. It was a an incredible experience, and I wanted to share what I learned. I didn't know any of the ""techniques"" before I had this dream, only after did I see a couple similar ones on the sidebar.

I will detail everything I remember, most of it I wrote down as soon as I woke up, and maybe it will help others to get into the lucid state of mind.

The dream started with me getting dropped off at my apartment by one of my friends. When I walked in, there was a guy in the kitchen putting away food. I recognized him as not one of my room mates, but I seemed ok with him being there. 

I asked him whats up, and he responded, ""Not much, but you are dreaming, man""

Once I realized that I was, he asked me sarcastically, ""What are you still doing here?""

I thanked him, and immediately created the bridge of a starship. I screwed around with the ship for a while, then shifted into the first part of the class.

There was a classroom, with about 30 people in it, sitting at desks. The classroom was filled about chest level with water.
There was a very terse, female instructor on a raised platform, so she was about knee deep in the water, at the front of the class. 

She explained that once the water filled the room, to realize that you are in full control and in no danger of drowning, thus triggering a lucid state, you must open your eyes, inhale, and start a conversation with the person next to you.

Mind you in reality, I have a fairly intense phobia of being underwater, so this was a bit unsettling. 

The water filled the room, and I was then underwater. At first it was panic inducing, but I quickly got over it, and began talking with others, entirely submerged. 

There was another in the class who could not handle it, and kept rejecting that he would not drown. The instructor gave him a warning that he would be ejected from the class if he could not handle it. He still could not, then as per what the instructor told him, he was kicked out, [teleporting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9sgC5Ft6zA&amp;feature=related) him Asgard style out of the room.

Things then cut to a different room. This one was a dark computer lab type room. Each of us was instructed to create a device, capable of displaying numbers and characters, that was most comfortable for each one of us to interact with. Some people had multi screened computers, others calculators, some cell phones, others had typewriters, while I had an old rotary phone. 

We were then told to input a string of numbers, ""starting at 9"". 
We were to repeat this, until all symbols on the screen, or dail were the number 9. 
I could not see how dialing would change the numbers on the face, but I started dialing a phone number any way. At first nothing happened. On the third or so try though, I dialed a number, looked down at the phone, and all numbers on it were 9.

Other people had trouble, and others got it faster than I did. Once I managed to get it though, I knew that I was in absolute control of everything.


At this point I could feel the dream fading, and knew that if I were to stay asleep, what I learned would probably be forgotten, or overwritten with another dream. I decided at this point to ""punch out"" of the dream, which felt like riding an ejection seat through a blur of white and gray, until I felt myself wake up. I only assume it was the same transporter mechanism used to kick the first guy out of the class.

I immediately wrote everything down, and figured I would share what I learned. 

I saw just before I typed this out the ""MILD"" technique of counting your fingers to trigger a lucid state, and thought that it was odd that I taught myself a similar method of becoming aware without knowing about it at all before hand.
Thanks for reading, hopefully it will help other people get into the dream state.

There are a lot of newbies to Lucid Dreaming nowadays, and they're being fed information which is NOT TRUE! People say that if you do 1,000,000 reality checks a day, you'll greatly increase your chances of becoming lucid... FALSE.

When people say this, they miss the most important point! Doing reality checks by themselves will probably not help you one bit. I bet if you just blatantly did a reality check every 5 seconds, for the whole day, LITERALLY... Your chances of getting lucid wouldn't increase more that 0.001% . 

The key to doing reality checks, is to **QUESTION YOUR REALITY!!!** Otherwise they are completely pointless! So, when doing a reality check, make sure that you link it with awareness. For example, you remember that you should do a reality check, you look around, see if there is anything out of the ordinary, smell the air, feel the breeze, hear the sounds, THEN do your reality check, just to make sure that you are in REALITY. But the key thing here, is the **awareness**. You need to be aware of your surroundings. 

So, now you know, RC's are pointless, unless you do them right.
If you get into the habit of just, doing it, and being like ""meh, did it"", you'll probably end up doing the same thing in your dream, and even if it works, you'll just dismiss it as normal.

TL;DR Reality Checks are pointless unless linked with awareness, and I recommend reading the whole thing so you don't get into a habit of doing it wrong.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_ru8iu,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/ru8iu/reality_check_misconception/,
1337074876.0,374,self.LucidDreaming,tnzmc,"Beginners: VILD (Visually Incubated Lucid Dream) method, explained!",,441,67,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/tnzmc/beginners_vild_visually_incubated_lucid_dream/,"There are many methods for induction of lucid dreams, **MILD** and **WILD** being the most preferred ones. Here in this post, I'll explain the **VILD** method for beginners. This method worked every single time for me, allowing me to have lucid dreams *at will*, hope it works for you guys as well.

**VILD** stands for **Visual Induction of Lucid Dreams** or **Visually Incubated Lucid Dreams**. VILD is pretty underrated, being used by only a number of people, however, I find this method extremely useful for beginners.

*Note:* The original VILD method was introduced by Peter Harrison on a lucid dreaming forum. I have made some minor changes and adjustments in order to increase the effectiveness, and chances of getting lucid once you're in a dream.

This method is divided into **5** parts, each part has it's own importance. Do it properly, and most likely you'll have a lucid dream tonight!

**Part 1**: The Dream Journal &amp; Reality Checks

**Dream Journal**:
Just like any other lucid dream induction method, VILD too requires a good dream recall. If you don't have a dream journal by now, you should probably forget about lucid dreaming (or just make a journal right away).

**Reality Checks**:
Perform at least 10 reality checks per day (15 recommended), so you can easily differentiate between reality and virtual reality. Some good and reliable reality checks are:

* Hold your nostrils tight with your hand, and try to breathe.
* Jump, in a dream you'll float because of absent gravity.
* Close one eye and try to see your nose. If you can, you're awake, otherwise in a dream.

**Part 2**: Designing A Dream

It's somewhat similar to Inception movie, where Ariadne designed an entire city for Cobb and his mates. However, you don't have to design cities, you just have to write down a **dream scene** on a blank paper. Imagine a **simple** dream scene and write it down on a blank paper. I recommend using a colorful glitter pen, instead of regular blue/black pens.

Here's an example how a dream scene looks like:

&gt; I'm in a square room, the walls are white and roof is grey. There's a door in the room. I'm with Jacob, (Jacob could be anyone, your friend, cousin, brother etc) he is wearing a red T-shirt and blue jeans. He is asking me how to perform a reality check, so I perform three reality checks (which work as you were actually in a dream) and tell Jacob why reality checks are important for lucid dreaming.

For best results, write the dream scene during early morning. Try to keep it as simple as possible, don't add much details (i.e. don't add any paintings in the room). Once you've written it, fold the paper and keep it in your pocket (this will help your subconscious understand the importance of dream scene and the paper). Now, whenever you perform a reality check, think about the dream scene, the room, Jacob, and why reality checks are important for lucid dreaming.

**Part 3**: Visualizing The Dream Scene

When it's time for you to go to bed, take out the paper and put it under your pillow (again, for your subconscious). Lie on your bed, listen to some relaxation music, and let go all the physical tension. Once relaxed enough, **visualize** the dream scene, the room, the walls, the roof, the door, Jacob, his t-shirt and jeans, everything like a short movie running in your head. You have to keep visualizing the whole dream scene from start to end, again and again. Do not visualize anything else apart from the dream scene written on the paper (for example, suddenly a pony appears in the room and we both ride it) No, just what you have written in the paper. If random thoughts appear (most likely they will), just ignore them and keep visualizing until you fall asleep. Make sure you **do not** open the door while visualizing the dream scene.

**Part 4**: In The Dream

The visualization will continue in your subconscious even after you've fallen asleep, and when the REM phase will strike in, your subconscious will make a dream out it. You and Jacob in a room, with white walls, grey roof and a door. The *only* difference will be: when you will perform a reality check in the room, your awareness will shift to your conscious, and hence, LUCID!

**Part 5**: Stabilization

The method is my favorite for a reason, no **instant blackouts**! You won't snap out of the dream instantly because you've visualized the dream scene enough to maintain it's stability and control your excitement. Here you'll understand why choosing a simple dream scene is important, because if you made a dream scene in the Playboy Mansion and Jacob being some model, you'll most likely get a blackout the second you get lucid because of the excitement. However, stabilization is always required, you can check out my [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/tjlrf/beginners_how_to_stabilize_dreams_the_easiest_way) for some tips on dream stabilization. 

Once you're lucid and the dream is stable, tell Jacob the advantages of reality check, thank him (or welcome him), open the door and you're free to go!

**Note 2:** If you didn't fall asleep while visualizing the dream, you should relax more and then try. If still not, the I'm sorry, this method won't work for you.


**tl;dr / quick notes**

* Maintain a regular dream journal and perform at least 10 reality checks per day.
* Write down a simple dream scene on a blank paper, with you performing a reality check in it.
* When in bed, visualize the dream scene as you fall asleep.
* You'll most likely have an exact copy of your visualization as a dream; the same night.
* You'll get lucid the moment you perform a reality check.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_tnzmc,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/tnzmc/beginners_vild_visually_incubated_lucid_dream/,

I eventually ditched the journal and happily reality checked as often as i could. I invented ways to play games with myself, and I had a lot of fun, but it got boring after a few years.

At the age of 15, lucid dreaming was second nature, and I could go lucid at any time I damn well pleased, I would just have to keep a certain mindset before I went to bed and I would nearly instantly become lucid.

Last year, when I was 16, I had got into a car accident that left me in a coma for a week, (Thank god I had no lasting brain damage.) During that week, I was lucid. Fully lucid. In fact, I didn't even remember getting into the car wreck, I was just living life. And it was strange, because when I slept, I had no dreams. And at this point i was dreaming fairly often.

I had gone on a year of dreamless nights, and one day I woke up in a hospital. I was confused, and I had been in a coma for a week. The date was just about a year in the past from what i last remember. I even remember the life I gave myself. I guess I was semi-lucid, simply for the fact that I subconsciously created a world. I was able to control my actions, and things had seemed to go my way. It was an interesting experience. The One thing that bugs me about this though, is that no matter what i lucid dream every night, no exception. I need no reality check, no mind set, or thoughts to try and help me out, I just sleep, and instantly resume control. Possible a lasting side effect. It keeps me mentally drained for the most part, and the only nights I don't lucid dream, are when I have stayed up for long periods of time, and don't dream at all.

I say this ahead of time because he tried lucid dreaming and what happened next was a complete 180 from his normal personality that came completely out of the blue. 

My boyfriend started reading about lucid dreaming and became interested in learning more. He started doing research and doing different techniques while sleeping like trying to wiggle his fingers,etc. I don't really know a whole lot about it because I had no interest in controlling or remembering my dreams to a larger degree than I already did and I normally had a hard enough time sleeping as it was. My boyfriend normally falls asleep in an instant, sleeps like a rock, wakes refreshed, but doesn't really remember his dreams. I never thought it was something I would need to worry about him trying though otherwise maybe I would have looked into it a little bit more.

The timeline is as follows:
Saturday night I started feeling him fidgeting more while we slept. I wake at the drop of a pin, so I felt him get up at least 5 times during the night. In the morning, nothing seemed amiss. I asked him why he was fidgeting and he said maybe it was because of his lucid dreaming techniques.

Sunday night was more fidgeting and more feeling him get up. I was starting to get slightly annoyed because every time he moved he woke me up and added to my own sleeping problems. On top of it, Monday morning he seemed groggy and was showing signs bordering on exhausting. He stayed home to work from home, claiming he would be able to concentrate more and would get more done. He's done this before, so I accepted it thinking it was probably better than going into the office with him being tired. We talk on AIM while we are at work so, even though we were apart, he was updating me on how he was feeling. He mentioned that he felt a heightened awareness and seemed able to think about multiple things at once when he normally was only able to concentrate on one thing at a time. I mentioned that he was probably on his second wind from being so tired and that he may crash sometime soon and fall asleep. He also came to visit me at work for lunch. At moments he seemed almost anxious and others he would zone out. I was worried about him driving home and asked him to text me when he got there. I told him to work home until 5 and then relax and veg out and watch tv. He made it home and, when I got home from work, we napped for about an hour before I had to go to class that night. While I was in class, he called me and texted me, telling me he missed me and couldn't wait for me to be home.

Now this is when it starts getting really weird; I got home from class and he pulled me out on the balcony. He then got down on one knee to propose to me. During this proposal he still seemed anxious, to a level that was more than just nerves about proposing. He mentioned about how he felt like he had been in a dream all day and wasn't sure if he still was in one. He said if he was still dreaming he wanted to make sure he proposed to me and wanted to do it right. It was then I realized something was amiss and told him I would say yes to him when he asked another time but I wanted him to be awake and realize what was going on when he asked me. I asked if he understood that and he said he did and seemed ok with it. He had a few ""profound questions"" that he wanted to talk about throughout the night but otherwise there weren't any big red flags. Later that night, we talked more about lucid dreaming and I asked if he thought he was still in a dream. He said no. He told me some things he tried to do while lucid dreaming, and one of them made me upset. This has been eating away at me ever since, but we ended up fighting. I went to bed angry.

I'm not sure if he slept at all that night. I fell asleep at midnight and for once slept through the night until 5:30 am. At 5:30, I started to feel him fidget again and got upset. I turned and saw him on his ipad. I asked what he was doing (angrily due to our fight and me being sleepy) and he just got wide eyes and didn't answer. I tried to go back to sleep but he kept fidgeting so I told him to go in the living room if he couldn't sleep since I had to get up for work in an hour. He jumped out of bed, opened our door, and then proceeded to stand in the doorway. He then paced around the bed like he wanted to get back in but didn't know if he should. Finally I gave up and got out of bed too. He told me he needed to show me something on his ipad, and I grabbed it. I saw it was his ""dream journal"" and things about lucid dreaming on reddit. I demanded ""Is this what you wanted to show me?"" and he didn't answer. 

I went into the shower to get ready for work. He then opened the bathroom door and the shower curtain and stood there staring at me with his ipad in his hands. I asked him what he was doing. He said nothing then tried to get in the shower with the ipad. I stopped him and said he couldn't bring that in the shower. He tried a second time and it was then that it hit me that he wasn't ok. 

I got him out of the shower and wrapped in a towel. He started asking about an ex-girlfriend, and said that he loved her but couldn't remember her face. He asked if we could go find her. I said we could but he needed to eat first. He then saw a picture of the two of us dancing at my sister's wedding. He pointed to me and said, ""This is Kim"". I said ""No, that's me. I'm Jess."" He then said ""I..."" and I said ""I what?"". He got confused then said ""I love you."". He kept saying one word like ""I"" or ""One"" and then not being able to finish the sentence. This went on for a bit. 

I had already called his parents by this time because I knew we needed to take him to the hospital. When they showed up he was still not making sense and wanted to go find Kim. We got him into the car with a little bit of hesitation on his part and to the hospital.

At the hospital he was the worst I had ever seen. He was anxious and scared of any sound. His eyes would get huge and he looked like a deer in headlights. He couldn't form a coherent thought and could barely talk. He would hyperventilate and whip his head around frequently to try and find any little sound. He acted over-stimulated and paranoid. It got so bad that that night he started fighting us when we tried to get him to walk anywhere, would start to cry and then stop and get confused, fell to the ground multiple times, and stood on a chair and almost fell off the back. I had never seen him this way, nothing even remotely close to this, and I was scared. At this moment, he has been involuntarily admitted into an acute care unit for at least 72 hours.

I'm sorry for writing a novel and I hope someone will take the time to read this. I just need to know if anyone has any information that may be pertinent to this or any sort of similar experience or reaction to lucid dreaming. 

**Edit:** I guess I should have mentioned this because people keep asking if he had taken medications. The answer is no, he only really took advil for headaches he got once in a while. We also rarely drink (and I mean rarely) and do not take recreational drugs. Even if he was hiding something that he was taking in secret (which I had every confidence he wasn't), the hospital took blood from him to double check and it came back clean and normal. Same with the cat-scan.

I knew it was a dream, was completely aware of the passage of time, and had a certain amount on control over what I was dreaming (well, I had control over what I did in the dream, the surroundings I couldnt change, and the setting was completely the product of my subconscious)

I was also able to get up a few times during the night for toiletbreaks/smokes etc, and even somewhat continue with the dream while I was awake.

The dream lasted pretty much the entire time I was asleep, and was incredibly vivd and detailed, it was as if I was there.  but anyhow, enough about the background, here is the setting (I may post what I did in this dream world if you are interested)

In the future, the world reached a point where all the issues of the 21st century were completely resolved. Everyone has access to machines that convert any raw material, into anything imaginable. For example, lead to gold, sand to food, salt water to bricks etc. Of course, this made money irrelevant, physical possessions became less important, and the world turned to the sciences.

Sometime after that, the world united under a council of leaders in celebration of the advent of biological immortality. Before long, every human on the planet was impervious to the ravages of ageing, though physical trauma could still kill the unwary. But even this was overcome with the invention of a little one-use device that took an imprint of a person, the moment before fatal harm was done.

The device, encased in the same almost unbreakable material used in modern construction, would send the blueprints to clone an exact replica of the person, with all memories intact, to a matter conversion of their choice, effectively, an extra life. The only problem was, this device needed to bend time, to take the imprint before the person died, or else they would be regenerated already dead. This required a huge machine that bent the laws of physics to create a material which could reach back through time.

Unfortunately that meant that no normal matter conversion machine could create the extra life device. But the factory produced enough that the devices were plentiful, and everybody was able to get them, so it didn’t matter. With Poverty, hunger, global warming, and even death abolished, all human hardship seemed at an end. Eventually people turned to artificial means of giving themselves that sense of achievement we all crave. They started creating hardships and obstacles to challenge themselves and others. The gaming nation was born.

Over the passage of time, the entire planet became an intricate, ever-changing multiplayer game. Society stagnated. Technological progression stopped as focus shifted from scientific breakthrough to beating the next game. This continued for generations, and history, science and all social restrictions were lost to the passage of time. But with unlimited resources, population swelled at an alarming rate, eventually the entire globe was tamed and filled with people. And demand for the extra life devices exceeded the supply the ancient factory could provide.

Players could only have a few extra lives a month… And players became increasingly unhappy as the problem became worse and worse. Eventually a group banded together to take control of the extra life facility. And with control of the extra lives, they became all powerful. But eventually their greed became too great. After only a few short years, they decided that extra lives should only be for the elite, and began policing the extra lives. Death squads roamed the world, killing anyone repeatedly until they only had one life left. But the games went on. The deadly obstacles were still there. As the entire surface of the earth was covered with these obstacles, and buildings were made out of a near impervious material, resources, once so plentiful, became scarce.

People began having to play for real, venturing into the deadly levels devised by the deluded minds of generations to find the raw materials. Population plummeted, and people began banding together in clans, leaving wide swaths of uninhabited land surrounding the most deadly of games. Places only the most elite would dare tread. Though society and technological advancement had ceased, evolution had not. As countless generations passed, human biology reacted the only way it could to give humans a stronger chance at survival. Humans with supernatural abilities began to be born. In the dream I was one of the first to discover these powers, and the dream was all about my experiences in that world.

So naturally I'm curious about those of you who have come along way in lucid dreaming.

1. Why do you do it? Is it for the ""fun factor"", being able to do all the things you can't in your normal life or is it for some deeper reasons; learning more about yourself, unfolding your subconscious? Maybe a mix of both?

2. How has learning to LD changed your ""awake"" life?

3. From what I understand, LD does not necessarily mean to be able to control your dreams, but simply being aware that you're dreaming in your dream. Being conscious of yourself inside a dream. Is this true? In that case, how difficult is it to go from being lucid to being able to fully control what's going on in a dream? 

4. Has anyone reached the point where you absolutely decide everything in a dream? Or are there still some elements to your dreams that are ""pre-written"" as if it's still a movie who somebody else directed but with you as the main character?

While lucid, I saw a man beating the crap out of some girls that all looked pretty similar to myself. The sight bothered me, so I approached to stop him. The man then grabbed me and said, ""This is your world, isn't it? You are the dreamer."" I tried to take control of the dream at that point, but it wasn't working.

It sounds weird and it's so different from the many other lucid dreams I've had.

[Re-post because the original thread was deleted for some odd reason],Medderick,414,89,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/y69rd/how_to_significantly_increase_your_chances_of/,"Tip 1: Setup a reward system (i.e dont fap untill you have a lucid dream)

This will REALLY work. When I say really, I mean REALLY. Dont fap before bed, wait untill the next day and if you have a lucid dream you have your own permission to fap. Of course it could be any other reward like Ice Cream or what ever you want but fapping works best for me

Tip 2: Vitamins? Vitamin B-6 is know for inducing extremely vivid dreams. So does vitamin B-12. What do I say about this? Buy a multivitamin and take two before bed, because not only will this benefit you but it will also induce more vivid dreams.

Fish oil? You may or may not have heard of fish oil (most likely you have) but it greatly increases dream recall so take one before bed and when you wake up in the morning you will remember 90% of your dream.

Tip 3: Edibles? Yes, bananas, cheddar cheese and apple juice are know for inducing crazy vivid dreams.

That's all I have. Post your suggestions in the comments, good luck and happy dreaming!

EDIT

Not fapping until you have a lucid dream will make your brain realize that if you have a lucid dream you get rewarded therefore increasing your chances of lucid dreaming.

Besides supporting the usual techniques like reality checking and dream journals, the app has a special angle when it comes to serving auditory dream clues. It tries to tie dream clues together with reality checking through something new called a **Totem Sound**.

With your Totem Sound you can train yourself to perform reality checks when hearing it in waking reality, and through your own conditioning, carry this ability back into your dreams.

I've been left deep in thought about it all day long.,nujurzy87,369,57,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/vgmqb/has_anyone_ever_had_a_lucid_dream_like_this_its/,"I couldn't help but think about this after I woke up (for the second time this morning). I had a lucid dream the second time around when I went back into the same exact dream. I was in the dream and I knew it was all too familiar, and that's when I started to connect the dots that I was dreaming, well, because I was aware that I had just had this dream and that I was awake just moments prior to being back there.. I wasn't too sure though at first if it was or not, so I started to look around..

I looked all around, saw people walking down the streets in a futuristic and highly cultured city. I looked up and that's when I knew something wasn't right and realized ""Yep, I'm dreaming. Wow... Isn't this something?"" This wasn't my first lucid dream, but this was the first time I went in there with the approach of using the scientific method. I was just too curious, I needed to understand. It all felt too real. I knew that it was a dream, but, I had developed the hypothesis and had no choice but to develop the hypothesis that there was more to it than what we can currently understand. No way around it. And let me tell you, this is when I highly analyzed and closely, very closely examined every detail I could in this dream. Gather evidence, closely examine, explore and explore and explore, come to some conclusion, uncover it all. It was like my mind was trying to understand itself better.

I remember looking up at the sky, and even though it was day time, it was very bright, the sun was reflecting off the buildings and clouds, and it was all just too vivid. Passed the clouds I saw the open night sky. It was almost as if there was such a light atmosphere that I saw straight up into the night sky even though it was day time. I saw teal and purple looking stars, stars I had never seen. I was standing there and acknowledging this in the dream and was just amazed. I had never seen this stuff before, what is it all? It was a profound and an enlightening experience.

I then looked at the clouds again and thought 'How is it that they are moving? I didn't consciously create this. I'm looking at it for the first time, but yet, it's all there..' It's like this dream world was governed by it's own laws of physics, and remember looking at that in the dream and wondering about it. The clouds slowly all moving in one direction, towards my left, like the wind was slowly carrying it. How is it moving, and I'm not telling it to move. I'm not in control, but they're moving.. How is this possible? How am I doing this? How is it all so highly detailed and I didn't even consciously create it? 'There's just no way I could've created it, just no way', I was thinking to myself in the dream. And yet here I am aware that I am dreaming and closely examining all of it only to just be baffled.. Baffled more and more and more the more I looked. Where am I exactly?

I wanted more, so then walked down the streets and saw people with tables outside selling things, some things I was interested in, some things I thought 'who would buy that?' All of this with the knowledge that I was in the dream. I remember even picking up an odd looking item and looking at it in detail and thinking 'I created this??' And then looked at people interested in things, putting things to the side, buying things.. 'They're buying this stuff I created? Why are some interested in certain things and others are putting things down? It's like they have a mind of their own?' Meanwhile I was still holding the item and I even remember how it felt, and rubbing my hand on it with great confusion as to how it could be fake.. I just couldn't convince myself I had created all of this, but wanting to explore it more, wanted to understand it more. I was just amazed looking at everything, even had a conversation with a girl sitting down by herself reading. I thought she was really cute, even though I know I again, was dreaming. But I went up to her because I felt she would understand me, maybe even tell me things about what was happening. Where I was.. all of that. I felt she would understand because everybody was moving and walking like cattle walking to their deaths in the slaughterhouse for the most part.. Mindless and unaware.. But she was just sitting there, deep in thought. Almost like she was more deep in thought then I was. She stuck out. For her beauty and for that reason. She was the only one that was still. And the most beautiful.

We started walking and talking in this very bizarre looking city and I saw people looking at her in a negative way for the way she dressed, I knew she was hurt by that. Even though everyone was dressed in clothes I had never seen, she wore clothes that didn't quite fit in with person A to B or person C to D.. Her clothes stuck out the most. Anyway, I had to tell her 'Don't worry about them. Be yourself. If they don't understand then it's their loss.' After a conversation with her, the entire time dying to know where I was.. Just unable to convince myself in this dream that I had created all of this, especially without my own knowledge of creating all of this to add.. I just had to ask, and felt almost scared to ask because it just seemed too real.. I asked with such curiousity, like a child asking 'Is there a God? Why are we here??', I asked her 'Where am I?' She looked at me and it was as if her hurt feelings and everything she was concerned about slipped out of her mind and she just looked at me and smiled. And what she said scared me. It really scared me. She said 'You know... But.. You don't know... You're not supposed to be here.'

That's when I of course felt very unwelcome.. Very unwelcome in my own head (crazy right?) I looked at her but just felt so lost and confused I couldn't even say anything. There were no words.. That's when I looked up again at the sky, to look at what showed me I was truly in a dream. I saw the clouds still moving, the stars.. and was almost in tears.. tears of joy, but just.. I was almost angry and frustrated too that I just couldn't see how I had created all of this. I was looking right at it all, just.. no way I created it. That's all I was concerned with.. I just couldn't see how I created this. And created it without my knowledge of doing so. No way I asked her for her to answer that and it was just really myself that answered that question. I couldn't even consciously come up with that answer by myself in this dream. I had to ask her and that is what she told me and it just scared me. Was it just my mind that told me 'You know but you don't know.' How scary is that? My mind telling itself 'you know but you don't know.' Again, my own mind telling itself 'You know but you don't know'.. And my mind is right, I don't know..

The more carefully I examined it and broke it all down as I was looking at it, the more I was convinced that there's got to be more to it all than my brain just creating this world. That's when I felt her hand on my shoulder and I felt very warm. She said 'It's ok. One day.' Then she told me her name was Melanie, I repeated that name to myself in the dream, and almost felt like I fell in love with her right at that moment. I even thought, how did my brain just come up with the name 'Melanie' out of all names in the world so quickly and I didn't even ask for her name. But it was just like everything made sense somehow though I still couldn't come to terms, and she was the one who made sense for me. I felt connected to her. What a beautiful and kind girl she was. But after she told me that she said 'I have to go, we can't talk, I hope you understand. I like you though. Remember me.' She walked off and was lost in the crowd. I looked around and felt so lost and scared, like a child who had just lost his parent in the city. No way to help myself. No answers, no way of surviving. I was an infant in this world in my own head.

That's when a kid walking with his parents walked passed me, looked at me and his eyes widened, and he screamed 'MOMMY!!!' as he pointed at me, and she grabbed him by his arm and walked off saying 'be quiet don't look at him.' I looked at her baffled.. I felt like Truman in the Truman Show when he started to uncover that something was going on, couldn't quite put his finger on it though, but knew something was happening. And even like that girl he met in the library and told him 'we're not supposed to talk', the same way this girl 'Melanie' told me. However, unlike Truman, I wanted to stay here and I was so hungry to really understand what this was. I was destined. I realized in this dream that brain neurology.. just can't explain this. Not yet at least. I told myself in this dream 'we are just too stupid to understand. I am too stupid to understand.' And it frustrated me.

I don't know.. I still just.. don't know.. But never felt more enlightened.. You have to be there, knowingly be in the dream, and go more into that dream world with that mindset.. To look, analyze, gather data, explore, research, hypothesize, seek all evidence, examine, wonder, touch hear and see.. To really understand. And I can tell you you will never be able to fully understand dreams from the real world. Only inside the dreams will you understand what it is. To actually touch it with the knowledge you're touching a dream. And I just can't help but to feel there is something in there.. More, much much more than we can currently understand. Something.. more. But, I could be wrong. My mind could have created all of this.. And if that's the case.. There is an entire world in the human brain itself that only shows itself when we are asleep and unconscious. And even that is one we will never fully understand. We may never fully understand ourselves and what lies within. What we think we know seems to only be the tip of the iceberg.

There may be nothing at all behind any of this.. But at the same time.. There's just.. more to it all.. Almost a paradox. There may be nothing at all behind this, but at the same time, there's more to it all. I woke up and came to that realization. I said that about my dream, but it applied to everything. Not just the dream, but reality.. There just may be nothing at all behind this place but at the same time.. there's more to it all. And we don't understand. Our minds are trying to tell us something. That we just don't understand. We are the universe, a way for the cosmos to know itself, and it's like the universe is telling us, or itself, that it.. we.. just don't understand. I don't know... I've never felt this confused, but at the same time, never felt this enlightened before. Maybe one day. Like 'Melanie' told me, 'One day.'

EDIT: here is the link to r/askscience where I asked how it is possible to use reasoning, a scientific approach in lucid dreams when the logic center/neocortex (i suppose) shuts down completely when you fall asleep..

1334992736.0,313,self.LucidDreaming,sl0xv,For people who want to learn to lucid dream: beginner's tips,mynameistrollirl,373,60,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/sl0xv/for_people_who_want_to_learn_to_lucid_dream/,"Hey guys!

I just discovered this subreddit, and I'm stoked. Anyway, I noticed that there are a number of posts about people who want to learn how it's done. I thought I'd outline a way that works for me, that will get you started. Some people call it the WBTB (wake back to bed) method. This method has a very high success rate.

Some tips that will improve chances of lucidity with this attempt:

-Try to have a regular sleep schedule for a few days beforehand.

-Abstain from cannabis for at least a week before the attempt. THC in your system interrupts REM function, which is where dreams happen. Most cannabis users barely dream, let alone LD.

-Eat choline-rich foods: eggs, beef, pretty much all meat. These foods also contain tryptophan, from which your body can synthesize serotonin and melatonin. Spinach is a good source of tryptophan, and milk.

If you're vegan... Shiitake mushrooms, celery, and tomatoes have choline.

When you're ready:

- **Set your alarm so that you wake up about 5 hours after falling asleep.** (Shitty, I know, but worth it for a good LD!)

- **When you wake up, you need to stay awake for at least 45 minutes** (1 hour is about right, but I've gotten it to work after 3 hours). Take a piss and shit if you can. Do some logic puzzles or something, get your brain going a little bit. The purpose of this waking-up-way-too-early business is to get your brain chemistry (acetylcholine/serotonin/melatonin levels) optimized for lucid dreaming. Think of it as an opposite nap. You're about to go back to sleep.

- **When it's time to go back to sleep, count your breaths and focus your thought on the patterns behind your eyelids.** Remind yourself that the next thing you are going to experience will be a dream. Before you fall asleep, your brain will start to paralyze everything below your neck, starting at the feet and moving up. If you notice it, don't be afraid, it's a natural mechanism for preventing your body from reacting to the input it will be receiving from you while you're in a dream (sleepwalking has to do with a disorder of this mechanism).

When you feel yourself about to drift off, sometimes you can push yourself into the dreamspace. Imagine yourself slowly spinning and falling down through your bed. If you do it at the right time, you'll feel yourself fall through, and you will be having what's called an OOBE, out-of-body experience. A good way to know when to do this is when you feel that paralyzation come into effect, mentioned in the last step. If you manage to pull it off, you might find yourself in a weird, dark, empty place. Just relax and allow the dreamscape to manifest.

If you can't retain awareness through the threshold between awake and asleep, that's ok. When you start to dream, you will be more aware than normal, with a much higher chance of becoming lucid. If you're not sure you're dreaming or not, there are a few dream checks you can do: push your finger into your hand (it will slowly go through), or plug your nose and try to breathe through it (you'll feel like you're breathing). There are more, but IMO these two are the best. If you practice doing these when you wake up, you 'll end up catching yourself in those false awakenings, when you dream that you wake up in your bed in your room, and everything looks normal (this is how a lot of dreams begin for some people). You can use the ""reality checks"" technique to possibly get lucid without using wake-back-to-bed, although it's only worked for me once, and the lucidity was not as crisp as with WBTB.

Every time when I have followed these guidelines, I've ended up in a vivid LD. If it doesn't work for you the first time, I'd suggest perhaps adjusting the duration of your opposite nap.

When you get it to work, great! You've just realized that you're dreaming, in a dream. What next? Don't get super-excited. You have an amazing opportunity before you, but you're in a delicate state. On one or two occasions, the excitement has been enough to wake me up. If you feel yourself slipping out of it, look down at your hands. This can help to stabilize your dream.

So, you've heard that you can do anything you want? Well, don't get caught up in trying to make things happen. The key is to simply let it happen. Just ""realize"" what's going to happen, passively visualize it taking place.

A good thing to try is flying. In the case that you've caught a false awakening, look at your bedroom window, and just let yourself almost ""fall"" through it. Just fly out of it, no big deal. You don't need to forcefully imagination-push yourself out the window. The more you focus on the conscious element of the dream, the harder it is for your unconscious to make the dream happen.

Typically, the LD drifts toward either a more awake state and then actually waking up, or into a deeper sleep where lucidity decreases. Keeping a balance comes with practice. Remind yourself that you are LDing now and then, but don't focus on your lucidity too hard. Again, looking at your hands can stabilize it if you feel yourself waking up.

The best thing to do is just experiment. Everyone is different. And keep a journal!

**EDIT:** I'd like to point out that the tips outlined before the bolded steps *aren't entirely necessary,* but they will improve the quality of the dream, dream recall, and chance of becoming lucid.

Ceasing cannabis use is probably the most important. I do know people who regularly use cannabis and still have dreams, and lucid ones at that. This is probably due to the body adjusting its sleep mechanism in response to long-term THC exposure. I experienced significantly duller dreams, and next to no dream recall, when I was using it. I think this is the case for most people. However, in either case, ceasing its use will certainly lead to much more vivid dreams, and highly improved dream recall. Think of it as a positive withdrawal effect.

As far as a regular sleep schedule, I almost never have a regular sleep schedule, and it still works for me. But I should note that the level of lucidity, and how far into the dream it is achieved, is not consistent for me. Exercise and sunlight exposure will help with regulating your circadian rhythm, leading to more consistent neurotransmitter levels, and a better sleep schedule.

Choline and tryptophan are precursors to acetylcholine, serotonin, and melatonin. Your body makes them naturally all the time. Eating foods rich in those precursors will simply assist your body as it naturally balances those levels. You can also take straight-up choline and 5htp supplements during the opposite-nap if you are really having trouble getting lucid. I think cortisol and norepinephrine/noradrenaline also play a factor in dream chemistry, particularly the awareness part, although I haven't looked into them as much.

There's also an enzyme that facilitates the production of acetylcholine that you can take supplements of, however some consider this ""cheating."" I think eating food rich in precursors should give you all the help you need, if you need it. ;)",,False,,t5_2r0f4,True,,,True,t3_sl0xv,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/sl0xv/for_people_who_want_to_learn_to_lucid_dream/,

Didn't think I would need a throwaway for this!",lucidbanana,393,77,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/sfz1n/nsfw_ate_banana_did_a_perverted_rc_had_first_ld/,"I got interested in lucid dreaming about three weeks ago.  My sleep pattern has been really off for a week now.  I've been getting little to no sleep at night and grabbing a couple hours whenever I can during the day.  Last night I went to bed at 3AM and set my alarm for 9.  Before I went to bed I read this subreddit for a while, came across a post about supplements and decided to eat a banana before bed for the vitamin B6.  As I fell asleep I attempted WILD but just drifted off.

At 8AM I was woken by the noise of my roommate getting ready for the day.  After he left, I dozed off again.  Here's where stuff gets interesting.

I wake up in my dorm bed.  Notice I have a larger-than-average boner.    Out of mild curiosity, attempt to put my mouth on the tip.  Success.  *I shouldn't be able to do that...  this must be a dream!*  I try counting the fingers on my left hand, and sure enough, they're blurry.  I spring out of bed, all thoughts of sex cast aside.

At this point I am wearing nothing.  I consider walking out the door in my birthday suit.  I throw on some clothes anyway, in case this happens to reality.  My first thought is to conjure an Iron Man suit and go flying, but I decide I should eat breakfast first.  Way to go, dream logic.

I walk out of my room.  Instead of my dorm, I'm in my house (the room I just walked out of is actually my sibling's).  I stop in the middle of the hallway and spin around once, just in case the dream starts slipping away.  It feels like I'm being firmly screwed into the dream by some invisible drill.  I proceed downstairs.

My mother is in the kitchen.  Our exchange:

""Is this a dream?""

[chuckle] ""A dream?  Maybe...""

""Is it?""

""Okay, yes.  It is.""

""Great.  I want you to tell me, in words, not images, what my greatest fear is.""  (Thanks to all of you who have pointed out this important distinction)

""I don't know.""

""Shouldn't my subconscious know?""

""You already established that you don't know what your greatest fear is.""  (This is true)  ""Why should your subconscious think any differently?""

I shrug it off and go to a drawer that IRL is always full of candy.  I consider having a king size Snickers, but my discipline wins out and I skip it.  I prepare some form of chocolate milk with this chocolate powder we do not have in real life.  Mother tells me I'm using too much.  My alarm goes off.

I remember everything in perfect detail, but I was not really amazed by the vividness of the dream.  Still, it's a start.  And I found a *great* new reality check.  Can't complain about that!

**Perform reality checks as regular intervals:**

*To perform a reality check, look at a piece of text, look away, then read it again. If it changes, you’re in a dream

*Randomly set your digital watch alarm and perform a reality check whenever you hear a beeping noise

*Whenever the Reality Prompter asks you, or when you see a message in the Lucid Dreaming Screensaver

*Perform a reality check whenever you urinate; arrive at work; walk through your front door; see the picture of an airport; check the time; think something is strange


**Make sure you record all your dreams every single night:**

*Aim to record a minimum of three dreams every single night

*Use a notepad or My Dream Log to note all your dreams

**Play music in the background, to help stimulate lucid dreams:**

*Try playing the Audio Stimulation CD, restarting it every time you wake up, or…

*Keep your radio switched on all night, to increase the clarity of your dreams


**Set your alarm to wake you after 4-½ hours sleep, then 90 minutes after, then 90 minutes after that, every night:**

*On awaking, stay still for a moment and ask yourself “What was I dreaming?” then follow your thinking

*Write your dreams and thoughts down within a few minutes, even if you don’t remember anything

*To increase the chances of having a lucid dream twenty times, keep awake for 90 minutes after your second wake (ie, after around 6 hours of sleep), then nap for 90 minutes


**Keep a separate log of all your “Dreamsigns”:**

*Dreamsigns are things which frequently occur in your dreams

*Regularly analyze your dream recordings to find Dreamsigns, then set your intention to perform a reality check whenever you notice these items in future
 

**Make sure you take control when you become lucid:**

*If your dream is hazy or lacks detail, shout “Clarity NOW!” or start spinning to
make things clearer

*If you wish to fly, simply will it to happen. If you have difficulties, imagine a
breeze brushing you off your feet

*To make things happen, try performing magic. You can also try opening a door
and expecting something to be there. Spinning is another effective way or changing the scenery

*If you’re faced with a monster or other fear, look at it in the eyes and tell it to “I am NOT afraid. I want to be friends. Welcome to my dream world!” This is only a dream and nothing can hurt you


**Try the Logical Feedback (WILD) technique, if you have the willpower:** 

*Wake after 6 hours for 90 minutes. During this time, read about lucid dreaming, set your intention and drink coffee after 45 minutes.

*Go back to bed and let your body fall to sleep, but keep your mind awake by counting to yourself: “1... I’m dreaming... 2... I’m dreaming.” If you lose your place, simply start again.

*As time progresses, you will experience mild vibrations and “jolts”. Ignore them: they are safe and you experience them every night whether you realize it or not

*Eventually your mind will suddenly become clear and feel refreshed. You may begin to view imagery around you. Begin to explore... you’re in a dream!

*If the dream begins to end or isn’t clear, shout “Clarity NOW!” or spin around in your dream


**If using Calea Z. take two to three capsules prior to going to sleep:**

*Crush the dried leaves and pack them into gelatin capsules

*Drink two to three capsules with warm water for best effect

*Use whenever required, however ensure you don’t “burn yourself out”

1337278027.0,302,self.LucidDreaming,trz9z,"Beginners: WILD method - adjustments, tricks and tips!",,354,52,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/trz9z/beginners_wild_method_adjustments_tricks_and_tips/,"**WILD**, without a shadow of a doubt, is one of the better and most powerful lucid dream induction methods. WILD is basically carrying your awareness from wake state to the dream state. Needless to say it's a difficult task, and beginners have several problems inducing a lucid dream using WILD. Here in this post, I'll describe some tricks, tips and adjustments for a successful WILD.

*Note*: This is **not** a WILD tutorial, it is a collection of tricks, tips and adjustments based on my previous experiments and experiences with lucid dreaming and WILD.

**1: WILD + WBTB = WIN**

Most of beginners try to induce a lucid dream using WILD method when going to bed, most probably you'll **never** have a lucid dream this way, because dreams are generally formed during the **REM** phase of sleep ([picture](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Sleep_Cycle.svg)), which occurs after 45-180 minutes of sleep. So trying to induce a lucid dream using WILD when going to sleep like is waiting for a bus at the bus stop an hour before the bus arrives. Chances are you'll fall asleep at the bus stop.
The proper way of performing WILD is:

* Set your alarm clock to wake you up after approximately 5 hours of sleep.
* Get up, don't turn on computer or TV (to maintain a good level of melatonin). Read a book, or your dream journal.
* After 45-60 minutes, return to your bed. The most vivid dreams will be ready for you.

**2: Relaxation**

Relaxation is very important in WILD. If you're not properly relaxed, your body will take additional time to fall asleep. Some good relaxation techniques are:

* Do stretch exercises during day time.
* (when in bed) Imagine yourself floating in zero gravity vacuum.
* Imagine yourself moving at the speed of light.
* **Focus** on the part of the body your want to relax, and imagine it releasing it's weight.
* Use of relaxation music for stimulating your muscles and brain. Classical, piano, flute, violin and cello recommended.

**3: The Hypnagogia**

After a few minutes of relaxation, you have to concentrate on your breathing or heartbeat. Within minutes you'll start seeing random patterns of light in the dark of your eyelids, known as hypnagogic imagery. You may also hear sounds, and feel sensations all over you body. It's completely normal, if you **panic**, chances are you'll wake your physical body and you'll need to start over.

&gt; I don't see any hypnagogic imagery, what am I doing wrong?

There are three possible reasons for not seeing hypnagogic imagery:
**A**: Your brain is still not in the REM or pre-REM (NREM 3-2) phase. That means you ignored my first tip.
**B**: Your body is still awake, that means you ignored my second tip.
**C**: You're too alert (or excited) to induce the REM phase and/or deceive your brain to make your body fall asleep.

**4: Natural Reflexes**

**Natural** spasms, jerks and reflexes don't usually mess with the WILD. However if you're about to enter the REM, and suddenly you start breathing heavy (because of the excitement or panic), you'll most probably ruin your attempt at WILD.
The most challenging reflex for me was the ""saliva swallowing reflex"". Hundreds of times I was about to enter the final REM, but then I swallowed and returned to the NREM phase. Later I started sleeping on my shoulder instead of back, this pretty much helped the saliva make its way down naturally.
The key is not to **fight** the reflex, but to let it pass. With time and regular practice, you'll gain control over your reflexes too.

**5: Stay Awake**

If you fall asleep every time performing WILD, try the following methods descried below:

* Keep your forearm raised perpendicular to the bed, and the body. 
* Change your default sleeping position.
* Try sleeping on a couch, or on a different bed.

**6: Entering The Dream**

If you performed all the steps correctly and maintained your awareness to the REM phase, you'll start seeing more complex hypnagogic imagery (usually 3D). Once you start seeing it, do **not** try to interact with it for a while. After a few minutes, when the imagery gets more stable and clear, imagine yourself (from a first person view) in there, and .. you're there!

**7: Sleep Paralysis**

If you get caught in a sleep paralysis before/during/after performing WILD, all you have to do is stay **calm** and concentrate on your breathing. You would not be able to move any part of your body, except eyes (in most cases, a number of muscles can be moved). If you try to move you body, and break the sleep paralysis, you would unintentionally activate the part of your brain responsible for hallucinations. It could be anything, from gorgeous ponies eating your bed sheet, to your brain trolling you hard by making a 3D thriller right there in your bedroom. If you simply concentrate on your breathing, instead of thinking hard about all the horror movies you've seen in past, most likely you won't hallucinate.

The key is to stay calm, and let your brain know, who is the boss!

**8: Stabilization**

Wouldn't it be frustrating if your lucidity lasted only a minute or two, after almost half an hour of successful WILD induction? You bet. Check out my [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/tjlrf/beginners_how_to_stabilize_dreams_the_easiest_way) for dream stabilization.

**9: Ending A Dream**

It is highly recommended to wake up after 30-40 minutes of dreaming. However if you continue, most probably you'll forget 80% of your dream when you wake up.
After waking up, do **not** go back to sleep for at least 2 hours. If you do, all you would remember is a faint memory of a successful WILD induction.

If WILD didn't work for you, don't lose your hope on lucid dreaming. There are many other methods of lucid dreaming, as powerful as WILD, **VILD**, is one of them.

It was a continuation of another dream I had about six months ago when I killed a guy.

In the original dream, I was at church camp. I was carrying on an affair with a black female counselor [I'm white and have no problem dating outside my race] who had a boyfriend who was also a counselor. He discovered us. I lured him to the woods, killed him, and buried his body. Got away with it too. Or so I thought. Until last night.

During last night's dream, I was in Austin, TX looking for a job. I was in this really swanky steak house that was incredibly busy. I was dressed nice and everyone kept mistaking me for a waiter, telling me their complaints. One woman's juice drink had a fly on it. Another's steak wasn't cooked right. I found the manager and helped them get it all sorted. 

Later that night, I was at a friend's house playing pillow fort with his kids. I was told there was a detective there to see me. He started asking me questions about the guy and I honestly couldn't really remember who he was until he started showing me photos of him. I asked if he was missing or dead or something. They still hadn't found the body.

He said several of the kids at the camp had seen him and I go off into the woods at the camp, but he never came back. I denied even remembering him, but the detective knew about the affair and during his questioning saw my eye start twitching. I was arrested.

(Strange this is, when he was questioning me about the missing guy, I remembered the previous sequence of events leading to his death. His discovery of us, his confrontation, even what she looked like. Tall, thin, short hair...)

Next thing I know, I'm in an underground holding facility and I'm watching a closed experiment with a monitoring device that will explode (don't remember what sets it off though) that they are fastening to my leg. 

My alarm goes off. End dream. 

I don't want to go to jail. 

Does anyone else dream in such vivid sequals? 

[FYI, before I went to sleep, I concentrated on Austin, TX since I am considering a move there. I have several friends wanting me to come up there including my first real girlfriend --that I met at church camp-- an old roommate who stopped by the house yesterday to pick up his kayak he's had stored at my house, and an old model friend who is now a patent attorney that I think may be interested in dating me.

Here's a quote from Stephen LaBerge as to why.

&gt; ""Before going further, I'd like to offer a piece of advice which may prevent some frustration. Sometimes people develop mental blocks that effectively prevent them from intentionally inducing lucid dreams. **Typically, they think of lucid dreaming as a very difficult state to achieve. Believing this seems to make it so.** However, I've learned how to have lucid dreams at will, so I know that it can be done, and i also know that it's easy--once you know how. My experience with teaching hundreds of people how to have lucid dreams suggest that almost everyone who diligently practices these techniques succeeds.""
-LaBerge, *Exploring the world of Lucid Dreaming* (p. 57-58)

But don't look at this too quickly and say ""I know the techniques and it doesn't happen!"" I did the same, read this and was refreshed...

&gt; ""You are not likely to learn lucid dreaming by quickly skimming through this book. Like most anything else worth learning, lucid dreaming requires effort. Motivation is an essential prerequisite; you have to really want to do it and make sufficient time to practice. If you persevere with the exercises and procedures, we are confident that you will increase your proficiency at lucid dreaming.""
-LaBerge (p. 6)

You can learn the basics of WILD, MILD, DEILD all the ILD's but it leaves out much that can actually help you. Your motivation has to be there and also persevere through the time it takes to get there.

Hint: There's a lot of testimonies about first time LD's and it may seem like you're one of the few who hasn't had one yet. Do not lose hope. A lot of the time this is because that first time LDer just read an article on LDing and got lucky. (Not always the case and not a bad thing either.) **That is not what you want.** You want to learn to control your dreams, not by chance, but by will.

So basically what you do is set an alarm to wake you up after about 5-7 hours of sleep. Then have an alarm to go off about 15 minutes after the first one, and then another alarm set to go off 10 minutes after the second one.

""What this does is the first alarm slightly wakes you up so you can turn it off, then right when you're about to fall back asleep the second alarm goes off and wakes your mind up again, then the same thing happens with the third alarm.(Do this before you go to bed at night, not after the previous alarm wakes you up)
By the time the third alarm goes off you'll be exhausted and feel like you'll pass out as soon as you close your eyes(which you probably will). This would be a great time to try the WILD method. It worked for me almost instantly and gave me my first LD!""

I have been interested in this practice for a long time, probably over 20 yrs, ever since I had my first LD as a child.  

I would say that I enter some form or some degree of lucidity on almost a nightly basis, but it isn't always a dream or anything that I usually try to create.

One way I happened to do this is observing a common physiological sign of falling asleep that I notice almost every night (sometimes day) before I actually fall asleep.  I hadn't heard of the WILD or MILD stuff but this may be something you guys could use too.

I noticed it a long time ago and looked it up and the answer I remember finding said that it was due to basically your brain checking to make sure that the muscles hadn't died or disapeared after they start shutting down for sleep.

With me it is almost always a leg muscle or arm muscle.  What happens is that it will twitch or spasm a little bit withing minutes to seconds before I actually fall asleep.  If I notice it and wake my mind up a little bit then I almost always have a lucid dream later on, sometimes nothing special or more than simply being asleep but being aware I am asleep and other times full control like I am in a simulator or something.

This phenomenon is called a Hypnic Jerk.

I often see ""common wisdom"" without any evidence being spread as truth. The problem with this happening is that lucid dreaming is self-fulfilling, meaning if you think something will or won't happen, then that is what occurs.

The 2 major problems:
------------
1) Sleep paralysis being scary. This is probably the biggest one, because I can think of no better way of inducing night terrors than telling people about (the dark man/the hag/insert scary SP story here).

SP is not scary for the vast majority of people who expect it. If you don't know what it is or what to expect, then some people's brains will make up nightmarish scenarios. But even then, the majority of people just can't move, and it sucks, but there is no demon crud going on.

The number of times I have seen people here say ""I can't lucid, but I wouldn't WILD if I was you. SP is hell on earth"" is out of control. I don't need to explain why passing judgement on something you haven't experienced is bad, but these people are the outcome of the problem, not the cause. 
The problem is people who should know better continuing to propagate myths about sleep paralysis.

2) I just got into a bit of an argument in another thread about WILD from first sleep, as opposed to WBTB. It seems that a common thread among a subset here is WILD cannot be done without waking up at 5 in the morning, because ""something something REM cycles"".

This is wrong. I WILD when I go to bed. I also WILD with WBTB. I will go as far as saying that *for me* it seems easier from WBTB, but I suspect that is because I don't practice perfect sleep hygiene and can struggle to go to sleep at night.

My point here is the 'old-timey wisdom' of how REM cycles work, without any evidence to back it up, is stated definitively as a global experience. I personally doubt this is even how REM cycles work, and suspect we do not drop straight into REM with WILD, despite experiencing it that way, because sleep doesn't work like that.

My point though is I DON'T KNOW. Telling people what they cannot do when you have no evidence is wrong. It is so accepted by some that they will argue about it despite given contrary evidence (""I can WILD at night"" followed by ""No you can't, no-one can""). 

---------
These are my bugbears. This place is great compared to most LD communities because it is 'science-based' and discourages astral projection talk and such. I think this minor lack of self-awareness is a flaw in the community right now.

Solutions? Add a bit in the sidebar about not running your mouth when you don't know for sure what you are saying is right, at least not pretending it is fact. Downvoting these topics and comments. Possibly even removing particularly damaging ""everyone who WILDs gets devil possessed"" bollocks.

Does anyone agree? Disagree? See any similar problems in other common topics? Other solutions?

This is one hundred percent true and completely non fabricated. So I've been trying to LD for a while now, I haven't really been consistent but for some reason last night I realized I was LD'ing.

So I said to myself, I'm going to find my subconcious. I've looked for it before, and I'd never seen it's face I'd always lose it in crowds or something, chase it down only to have it run away and escape while I would wake up.

I was determined to find it last night, and the way it went down was pretty terrifying. I basically willed it to come out. I was in these woods with black trees, and said to myself. I'm going to see my subconcious. What happened next still gives me shivers. I began to shake uncontrollably, in the dream I felt cold and chills ultimate frisson, and I was half awake knowing that I was close to waking up, but I stayed vigilant. The feeling physically was terrifying, it felt like I was being electrocuted. Finally he showed up. This part is a bit cheesy and doesn't make sense to me, He was in a black cape and had a mask on. I knew it was him because I was terrified, he said that if I wanted to see his face I had to get the mask off, which is symbolic to me in some ways, So we started fighting, and he was trying to kill me. We used swords (again a bit cheesy) but growing up as a child I was obsessed with swords and capes and robin hood and the like, so it makes a bit of sense.

The fight was long and hard and I kept asking him questions, he spoke with my voice but I didn't get a chance to see his face yet. Finally the most chilling answer I got was when I said ""I'm so confused right now, what am I supposed to do"" and he said ""You have to kill yourself."" 

Now, I knew immediately in the dream that he didn't mean physically kill myself, but he meant kill this side of me that cares what others think, and the side that fears failure. I knew that's what he was talking about, I needed to kill that to become him. In my eyes he was free, and finally when I accepted this notion, the mask came off and I looked at myself and it was one of the most disorienting feelings I've ever felt in my entire life. 

It was me, but a bit crazier looking, with this youthful grin, a me that I knew a long time ago, but have sort of tried to mature since then. He then said ""Im coming for you"" and then things got a bit hazy and I woke up. Pretty crazy experience, I'm not sure what to do now. Love to hear people's thoughts.


-edit- I'd like to clarify something, to all the people saying ""hurr durr, no you didn't meet your subconcious"" I'd like to know why that really matters to you, it was an important dream of mine. I'm not trying to say ""Hey I met my subconcious and you can too if you pay me 4 payments of $34.99. I'm not trying to push an agenda, maybe it wasn't my ""subconcious"" but whatever it was, that's how it was personified and it was important to me. I don't see what attacking me and trying to say that I does. How does it effect you if I say ""I met my subconcious"" its not like other people are going to go and hurt themselves in the same pursuit, if the end result is a cathartic event for myself or others, why do you feel like you have to detract from that? Furthermore, why do you have to downvote it because it's something you don't agree with?

If you still have not found something that suites you here is my hints. Rc's Rc's Rc's, hell do one now. Set up some noticeable things that you can see everyday. I do a reality check everytime I get on reddit or see it at all. Everytime I walk through a door. Also, when you do your reality check, your must reliable should be, is this reality. Look at everything. Is the decor correct? Are the people around you who they should be? Is the weather natural? Is anything happening that would  not usually? Also Dream journals. I went from being able to remember where I was, to being able to write a 3 page essay on everyone of my dreams. Try to get in that Dream journal at least 4 times a week. It helps so much trust me. Try to Daydream. Just think about vivd scenarios. Try to think about dreaming, reality checks, becoming lucid. Also if your bored and having nothing to do for 5 minutes or whatever, Try a mantra. Something as simple as ""I will lucid dream"" Now, whatever you want to do, method wise, is up to you. You might be able to WILD tonight, but if you tried, you know how much of a pain it is. If you try MILD, which i do, you probaly won't lucid dream tonight, but a year down the road, you will be able to lucid dreams, 3 to 5 times a week. Also WBTB greatly increases your chance to Lucid dream, but it takes away from sleep, which is a pain. Now what i would do for MILD is the following. Before you go to bed, *DO NOT CLOSE YOUR EYES* and chant "" I will lucid dream"" until you get tired. Concentrate as much as you can on the idea of what you are chanting. Once you are ready to go to bed, like you can barley keep your eyes open, clsoe your eyes and chant ""I will lucid dream"" until you fall asleep. With luck and practice, you will be able to conclude you are dreaming. Good luck, dream in the stars!

**DILD: Dream Induced Lucid Dream** – In this method, which is also the most popular one among learners, you’ll only need to recognize a clue that tells them that they are dreaming. For this particular technique to be effective, those doing it will need to have a good level of awareness, something that not everyone will be able to do. This sense of awareness is tested because you’ll need to identify the clues that you’re given in the dream.

**MILD (Mnemonic Induced Lucid Dream)** Courtesy of [http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/mnemonic-induction-of-lucid-dreams.html](http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/mnemonic-induction-of-lucid-dreams.html) – Using the MILD technique, when you are lying in bed tonight, go through some lucid affirmations in your mind. This is really where the term Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams comes from - you are programming commands into your memory, to be recalled later on in your dreams. For example repeating: ""I am dreaming now.""

__________________________


**WBTB (Wake Back to Bed)** – While this isn’t a full-blown method in on itself, it’s a great way of complementing the other DILD/WILD/MILD methods. All you have to do is interrupt your sleep cycle in about 4-5 hours of sleep and think about lucid dreaming while you are up for near 30 minutes. In fact, many people had their first lucidity experience with this method

_______________________________________


**WILD: wake induced lucid dreaming** You'll have to enter sleep paralysis which can be achieve by laying completely still. After achieving SP you imagine dream scene and you're lucid.
_____________________________________


**DEILD: Dream Exit induced Lucid dreaming** Courtesy of [http://www.dreamviews.com/wiki/DEILD-Tutorial](http://www.dreamviews.com/wiki/DEILD-Tutorial) A DEILD is basically a shortened WILD. This technique takes advantage of the fact that as you awaken from a dream the brain remains in dream mode for a few moments, provided you don't move. Since your brain is still using REM waves, you can easily slip back into a dream without having to trick your body into falling asleep. However, if you are at the end of a REM phase you won't be able to DEILD. If you do this technique right you are almost guaranteed a successful LD.

Whenever someone asks a question relating to ""how do I DILD?"" Im going to automatically link them to this thread. I'm asking if you guys can do that also. I was getting sick of retyping the same explanations every single time.


Also, if there are any questions that you'd like to ask not necessarily related to this but if it's a question that might be a FAQ or that you don't understand. Don't hesitate to comment or PM me.

You realize that you're dreaming, and next moment all you see is infinite black. When I was new to the concept of lucid dreaming, I too experienced many blackouts. Many of my dreams lasted only 1-3 seconds. Anyway, here, in this tutorial is how to stabilize your dreams, and use blackouts for chaining dreams, also known as DEILDing, for better and longer lucid dreaming.

When beginners perform a reality check in dream, and come to know that they're actually dreaming, they either get really excited or infinite loops of random thoughts take over their consciousness, dream start getting blurry rapidly, and they fall into *the void*

Now, once you've fallen into the void, you're left two options:

* Make a way back to your dream (comparatively easy)
* Enter a new dream or continue the same dream from the void (difficult for beginners)

**Prevention**
Every time you perform a reality check (both; reality and dream), do NOT think: 'meh! I know it's not a dream, let's perform a reality check anyway'. If you think this (and similar) while/before performing a reality check, it simply means you're not fully prepared for a lucid dream. What if it actually turns out to be a lucid dream? but since you've already convinced yourself that it just couldn't be lucid dream, all you would get is a blackout. However, everything would still be under your control, for a minute or two.

**Making a way back to your dream**

The dream is fading away, vision is getting blurry and focus is losing it's precision. The situation seems pretty much out of control, but actually, it's not, the REM waves are still at their max. All you have to do is stay **Calm** and grab anything (if there's nothing within you reach, don't run for the streetlight, grab your T-Shirt instead) you *see*! Once you get hold of anything, feel the touch. The more you perceive through your senses, more stable the dream gets.
Tell yourself you stay calm, and command your subconscious: ""Lucidity Max"", ""Intensify"" or anything which would help your subconscious understand what to do next.
After a minute a two, when the dream has gained even stability (don't hurry if it hasn't), take out ACME Lucidity Pills from your pocked, and take a pill or two, they actually work!
That's it! The dream it under your control now. Keep commanding your subconscious throughout the dream whenever it gets blurry.

**Entering a new dream or continuing the same dream from the void**

For some reason, if you couldn't stabilize you dream and you're in complete blank, you can *still* enter a new dream, or continue previous one.
You're in the void, with faint sensation your physical body. You have a little time left now before your REM activity ends. All you have to do is to remain **perfectly still**, and follow either of the method described below:

* The Speed Train (this one's my favorite, bit difficult but foolproof)
Get hold of an imaginary handle or hook of a train/object moving at the speed of light. Surprisingly enough, you'll get dragged by this object back into a dream withing moments at a very high speed. Imagining and believing that the object is fast and powerful enough to cross the void is important. Once you're back, perform reality check, stabilize and you're ready to go!

* Fall back
Imagine (don't look) there's a small pond right behind you. Cross your hands and allow yourself to fall into this pond. When you open your eyes, you'll either be in a new dream or in your bed (false awakening), better perform a reality check, stabilize and you're the

- - -

It may not be entirely new, but here's the method I've been working on:

* 1. Lay flat, on your back, with your hands resting at your sides and your legs **not** crossed.
* 2. Close your eyes, and breathe deeply (inhaling until your completely lungs are full, and exhaling until they are completely empty) until you feel **relaxed**.
* 3. Once **relaxed**, and only once **relaxed**, begin counting from 1, with 1-2 second intervals between numbers.
* 4. Don't ""concentrate"" on the counting, but let it continue ""naturally.""
* 5. Before long, you will feel yourself slipping away. If done correctly, the counting will remain in the background as you transition into the dream world. 
* 6. In a successful attempt, you will be able to *feel* the transition to the dream world. You stay aware, but your mind starts dreaming. The counting continues ""on its own.""
* Side note: Sometimes, you will lose awareness during the transition. Do not worry - the ""ringing clock"" of counting in the background will usually serve as a reality check and make you aware again.
* 7. Lucidity! Awesome! From here, it's alright to stop the counting as long as you've ""planted"" yourself in the dream (arm twirling, spinning, RCs, etc.).

I would greatly appreciate some more testers, /r/LucidDreaming. So far it's just my friend and I experimenting with this method, but we've mild success with it.

Discover dreams and nightmares filled with puzzles and secrets to help Howard find the meaning to his life.""

""The narrative is split into 3 acts with multiple endings that are possible based on how much you as a player have explored. Each act immerses you in new worlds that help to decipher Howards past, emotions and ambitions. Confront Howards mislaid concerns in the form of nightmares and reconcile the loss of his uncle.""

Dream got Greenlit in the first batch of 10 Greenlit games! So thank you for the support if you know of us!! [you can check it out here on steam!](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=92647949)

(Best high ever!),Apple_Bloople,299,45,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/142wk4/doing_drugs_in_a_dream_best_high_ever/,"Hi there.  I'm brand new to Reddit and I am quite pleased to see that there is a lucid dreaming sub-reddit.  I just want to share with you a really fun way to explore your subconscious.

I go lucid from time to time and one of the most wonderful things I have ever experienced is doing drugs in a dream.  Here's what you do...

1. Once you achieve lucidity, get a firm grip on your current reality by performing the standard lucidity enhancers. (Spinning, screaming, clapping your hands, etc...)

2. Say out-loud, ""I sure am glad I have this bag of mushrooms in my pocket!""

3. Reach into your pocket and pullout the mushrooms. (You may find that you pull something really weird out of your pocket, but don't worry about it^^)

4. Hold it in front of your face and admire it.  Once again speak OUT-LOUD and say something like ""These mushrooms are the best mushrooms in the known universe!  They are super potent and are known to cause uncontrollable euphoria! They are delicious, fast acting, and take affect the second you swallow them!""

5. Eat them.

What happens next is... like nothing that I could even start to explain.  Essentially, you trick your brain into giving you the most awesome experience possible without even having to use your conscious imagination!  I've done a lot of hallucinogens, but NOTHING compares to a custom trip designed by your own brain.

I didn't know what to ask so I just asked her what she like to do in her spare time. She said ""nothing special. Watch TV and stuff. But sometimes I wish I could do more than just that"".

If you just read this and don't implement it, you're wasting your time. It doesn't take much work to lucid dream, you just need to make a PLAN on what you're going to do. Making a plan can take only a few minutes. All it needs is consistency.

**The Essentials:**
If you don't have the following down as a MINIMUM, don't waste your time trying to lucid dream. It most likely won't work, unless you're a natural.

1. Dream journal. It's been discussed like crazy, but you NEED a dream journal. Get any notebook and pen/pencil and put it next to your bed. As SOON as you wake up, IMMEDIATELY focus on the dreams you had. Don't think a single thought after waking or else you'll lose your dreams. As soon as you wake, remember your dreams, playing them out like a movie in your head. Grab your notebook and write down everything you remember.

     Important! Even if you don't remember a single dream, grab your notebook and write down ""Don't remember."" The dream journal has many functions. It sets your intention to remember dreams upon waking. It sets up the habit to remember dreams. Even writing in your journal when you don't remember a dream tells your mind subconsciously to remember its dreams upon waking the next day. It forms a habit. After writing in my journal for a few weeks, I was remembering about 3 dreams in detail every morning. I then stopped writing in it thinking ""who cares? I remember all my dreams now."" After a week I could barely remember a single dream because the habit was lost. It matters, people.

2. Upon going to sleep, tell yourself that you're going to have a lucid dream. If you're pretty good at lucid dreaming, this is when you set up a goal for yourself to improve the dreaming. Say something like ""I will have a lucid dream tonight. I will wake up within my dream and then accomplish -x-. Right after waking up, I will immediately remember and write down the dream."" Setting up intentions like this prepare your mind for what you want, and you greatly increase your chance.

**The number one reason I get lucid dreams:** Even after doing the above for a while my dream recall was very good, but I just couldn't become lucid in the dream. Then I started waking up a bit earlier than expected, doing something for half an hour, then going back to sleep. I get lucid dreams half the time this way. So do this:

Let's say you need to get up at 7. Set your alarm clock for 5 oclock. When it rings, get up and do something, anything. Make absolutely sure you're not really sleepy anymore, so if you're still groggy whenever you stay in bed, get out of bed and read a book, do homework/work, or check your email. After half an hour has passed, go back to sleep, again renewing your intentions: ""I will wake up within my dream and accomplish -x-. I will remember the dream upon waking and write it down in my journal."" Then you can go to sleep until 7. Thinking a bit more about lucid dreams while trying to fall asleep can help as well.

Don't worry about losing half an hour of sleep. I'm not sure why, but you get rested a lot better from shorter naps and breaks in sleeping. You'll make up in that hour and a half what you would have gained in 2 hours. You'll probably feel even better, actually. Some Eastern philosophies include lucid dreaming in their practice, and their technique involves waking up every two hours at night!

**Conclusion:** If you do the above practice every day (which in reality only takes a few minutes of ""special"" effort) then you should have your first lucid dream within a few weeks, I'd say.

You can take your practice further and add a bunch of other techniques, like reality checks. Plan BEFOREHAND that ""I will perform a reality check every time I _____"" (walk through a door, check my phone, stop at a red light, etc). Ask yourself, ""am I dreaming?"" and consciously look around at your surroundings, being very aware. This will help a lot.

Also, try not to waste time just playing around when you get your lucid dreams. If you do, they'll collapse and you will never expand. Set up goals for yourself, like extending the time of lucidity, not waking up, asking dream characters questions, practicing to fly, learning something, etc.

Sleep sitting up.




Not the whole night, just the latter half. What you need to do is sleep 3-4 hours in your bed, wake up (with an alarm) and go finish your sleep in a recliner or deck chair that has head and neck support. 

I used to only LD once every few months, now I have them whenever I drag myself to the recliner (a few feet from my bed) in the middle of the night.

The full method is described here:

http://www.dreamviews.com/beyond-dreaming/118621-sitting-technique-maximize-your-chances-obe-astral-projection.html

It works because your body, being exhausted, will easily fall asleep, but your mind senses (through the vestibular system) that you're in an upright position and so remains aware. The bottom line is that you're asleep, but the higher mental processes that are usually offline at this time such as planning, working memory, attention, problem solving, and self-referential mechanisms are prevented from being shut down. Most of these functions are located in the prefrontal cortex, so I'm guessing that specific part of the brain remains active while sleeping upright and shuts down while asleep in natural positions. Also, you don't go into the deep sleep stages, so you remain in the sweet spot between waking and coma-like sleep.

A few notes

-Read the link, it has a few helpful tips and illustrations.

-Every single one of the LDs I've had from this method (which is more than 70 now) begins in a replica of my room (the place where my recliner is). As such, my room functions as the loading dock of my entire LD universe.

-This method produces LDs that are very high level.

-Make sure you support your lower back with a pillow. If you're not comfortable, you won't fall asleep.

-Also helps to have a pillow behind your neck so that you're facing forward like you are in waking life. 

-The recliner/deck chair should be roughly at a 120-130 degree angle.

-Put the alarm on the other side of the room to make you get out of bed.

-If you're having a hard time falling asleep after waking up, I've found that sleep deprivation (30 hours+) works just as well with no need for WBTB. What you do in that instance is stay up for about 40 hours then go straight to the recliner/deck chair rather than your bed. This results in sleep paralysis which you can then convert into an LD. For some reason, going to the recliner in the first half of the night doesn't work without sleep deprivation (rem rebound?).

-If you have trouble falling asleep and don't want to use sleep deprivation, I guess you can only sleep 2-3 hours before WBTB. I'd still strongly recommend you use sleep dep if you can't fall asleep after 3-4 hours sleep, as I haven't experimented with 2-3 hours (because I fall asleep fine on 3-4). 

-Whatever you do, don't turn on the lights. That makes it much harder to fall asleep. If your laptop/computer has to be on, download F.lux to eliminate blue glare.

-This technique has made lucid dreaming a choice for me. What I mean is that before I struggled and struggled with little to show for it. Now I simply ask myself, do I want to LD tonight? Y/N? If I'm too tired, have an early wake up or a hectic schedule the next day, I just decide that I'll LD the night after. If I'm not zonked out and don't have any commitments the next day, it's a go. I'm now on the choice side of the LD equation. I simply have them when I want to have them rather than just desperately hoping for them. 

-This is the chair I'm using, just to give you an idea:

I carry a 'totem' with me to remind me to do RC's (it's a sonic screwdriver.) Every time I see it, touch it, whatever, I check. However the first thing I think of is not asking the question ""Is this a dream?"" Instead I say something else.

**I don't know if this is a dream.** (yet)

I suddenly discard anything I knew in the past few moments, and treat the moment as it's own new thing, not knowing if it's real or dream. This is important to me because often times I'll think to do a reality check and think ""Eh, of *course* it's not a dream"" and not even do a RC. That's bad.

So instead, any time it crosses your mind to do a RC, treat the moment as if you had just arrived. Observe, test, be aware. Do not assume anything until you know for sure.

This is helping me switch from my mindset of ""I just know it's not a dream"" and doing real RC's. So if you have similar problems, try out this method of thinking.

The other night I met a girl, and she was fantastic. We locked eyes, and I *knew* she felt the same way about me that I felt about her.

Do you know what it feels like when clouds stop moving and your heart has doubled in size? I had only known her for a few moments, but in those moments I learned more about her than  I would have in ten years. Do you know how it feels when you are safe and protected, when nothing could go wrong and everything is right? Do you know how it feels when you thought it was never going to go away, but everything instantly fell apart? When something you didn't even consider to be a possibility happens? 

Do you know how it feels to *wake up*, from a dream, choking back tears because of a sick trick you played on yourself, knowing that everything you thought was real was nothing but an illusion?

It's as if you're a dog, and your companion has been holding up your favorite treat for hours.

*Hours.* And you sit there, waiting, every moment growing more difficult than the last. Just as you're about to give in it all vanishes and you're left wondering why you ever trusted anyone including yourself.

The struggle to remember the play I was about to perform in brought me to lucidity.

I was dreaming.

Thank god.

I started to lose the dream. I remembered to spin around. It made me very, very dizzy, but it consolidated the dream. I was stable. I was firmly encapsulated in the dream environment.

The first thing I did? I looked at my hand. I was wearing a glove, a part of the play. I've been taking macroscopic photos with some new camera equipment and having the ultra close up perspective at hand I figured in a dream I ought to be able to do that with my eyes. I was able to zoom into the fibers and lint of the glove with incredible amounts of detail. I was able to visualize the space of a millimeter as though it were the size of the room around me.

I left the theatre, through the front door. The sun was above the parking lot. I made the sun roll beneath the horizon and the moon lift into the sky. I lit stars. Flying was difficult at first. I managed some strong leaps. But always returned to the ground. I realized I didn't have a strong enough understanding of how flight would be. I could characterize it. Instead of leaping to fly I chose to rocket, like a missile or jet. Which was specific enough to work. 

I blasted toward the moon, I was still being pulled toward the ground as I flew and I passed through trees and leaves. I am unstoppable, I conjured, and choosing to worry less about flying high enough to be above the trees I chose instead to fly through them completely. A barrier formed around me and trees splintered.

Once I cleared them, and all I could see was the moon in the sky the moon began to blink very rapidly, like a bad television picture. Around the moon, all across the sky were more moons, standing still in different phases flashing rapidly in and out. As though I were changing the date or the channel so quickly that it could have been all these phases and positions simultaneously.

I was surprised. I couldn't consolidate the feeling of surprise. I couldn't take control of the moon. If I stopped flying. The flashing stopped and the moon and sky returned to a single frame again. If I flew again, eventually, at a high enough speed, the flashing picked back up.

Inspired by her son's interest in videogames, Jayne Gackenbach at MacEwan University in Canada has discovered that gamers have more control over their dreams compared to non-players. Rather than viewing a dream as an unfolding narrative, like a movie for example, videogame players are more active inside their dreams. Players are more likely to fight back when pursued, and actively make decisions within the dream-scape that have the ability to alter the course of the experience, reports New Scientist.

He explained, literally, every research paper I read and the concepts I need to to know for this exam. In waking life, that amount of information combined with pre exam stress is hard to retrieve. I'm amazed how much information we store in our minds if only we could find a way to access it, I found my way- Lucid Dreaming. It was incredible.

When you say the 'this' in ""Is *this* a dream?"", scan your environment with your eyes. Pause after you say 'this' while you take it all in. If you don't mind looking insane, reinforce it with a sweeping hand gesture.

1340205195.0,231,self.LucidDreaming,vbxgt,"Introducing New LD Induction Technique: GILD or ""Gravity"" Induced Lucid Dream on reddit.",,273,42,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/vbxgt/introducing_new_ld_induction_technique_gild_or/,"I prefer **WILD** over any other **LD** induction technique because of high success rate and reliability. When I was new to the concept of **WILD**, I tired all possible methods and finally after 7 months, had my first ""accidental"" **WILD**, which I later named **GILD** or **""Gravity"" Induced Lucid Dream**.

**GILD** or **""Gravity"" Induced Lucid Dream**, works every time for me. This technique worked for 2 of my friends as well, on their 2nd and 4th try respectively, surprising fact is they never had any **LD** before.

So, finally I deiced to share it on **reddit**. I'll post this technique on **[LD4all](http://ld4all.com/forum)** and **[DreamViews](http://dreamviews.com)**, once /r/LucidDreaming approves it.

Brace yourselves, because this is going to be a long post.

There are basically 6 parts, works best with **WBTB** and afternoon naps.
Here's how it goes:

**1**: **WBTB / Afternoon Nap**

* Set your alarm clock to wake you up after approximately 5 hours of sleep. Get up, don't turn on computer or TV, stay awake for about 20-45 minutes. 

* Return to your bed.

* You can skip this step during afternoon naps.


**2**: **Relaxation** 

* During early morning, your ""body"" will be in a relaxed state by default. You can stretch/flex your muscles for additional relaxation. Try to make it as relaxed, and as ""heavy"" as possible. Once you're ""deeply-heavily"" relaxed, proceed to the next step.


**3**: **Feel The ""Gravity"" + Entering SP**

* We're so used to Gravity and weight of our body that we don't even notice Gravity pulling us towards the Earth's core all the time. If you're sitting on a chair, ""feel"" about how much weight you're exerting on the chair, and how Gravity is silently pulling you and the chair towards core.

* Once you learn how to ""feel"" the Gravity and weight of your body (takes less than 1 minute to learn), you're ready for next step.

* **All** you have to do is **""feel"" the weight of your body** on the bed and **""attraction"" of Gravity**. You don't need to focus on breathing and/or ""counting"". All you have to do is focus on Gravity. If possible, don't actively watch hypnagogic imagery, either completely ignore it or passively observe it. 

* Your body will get heavier and heavier, it may feel like Gravity has increased; and it's pulling you with more force. Sometimes it's associated with a feeling of suffocation, caused by the increased ""weight"" of your body, it's completely safe however, because Gravity hasn't actually increased, or has it?

* With the feeling of ""increased Gravity"" comes **SP**, it may take up to 10 minutes. You may also hear random noises and/or physical sensations, don't panic and ignore them. 

&gt; *Quick Tip*: Never expect or ""wait"" for **SP** and/or its signs, it'll eventually come anyway!


**4**: **Entering The Dream [1] / Shifting Consciousness**

* It is the most important and interesting step. Once in pre-**REM**/**SP**, your ""physical body"" will be detached from your brain, but your consciousness will continue to focus on Gravity and the weight of your body, but since there's no ""physical body"" left to focus on, your consciousness will form a separate ""dream body"" once the **REM** cycle hits. This feeling of transition is unmistakable, you may feel a sudden shift of consciousness from ""real world"" to ""dream world"".

**5**: **Entering The Dream [2]**

* Your brain has entered **REM** and now you're in your ""dream body"", now you can try any of the method described below for completing transition:

**(a)**: **Sink in bed**. Don't open your eyes yet, and imagine your body sinking in bed. Once you feel you're not on your bed anymore, open you eyes and you're free to explore. The room may look like an **exact** copy of your actual room, don't be surprised or confused. Make sure you perform a **RC** and [stabilize your dream](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/tjlrf/beginners_how_to_stabilize_dreams_the_easiest_way) before jumping out of the window.
And, don't sink in too much or you'll open your eyes somewhere in middle of Earth's core.

**(b)**: Create a new dream scenario. Imagine your bed is in middle of a valley, there are butterflies, smell the flowers, feel the cold morning breeze. Now open your eyes and you'll wake up in middle of a valley of flowers! Perform a **RC** (duh!), [stabilize your dream](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/tjlrf/beginners_how_to_stabilize_dreams_the_easiest_way) and you're ready to go!

**(c)**: You can simply open your eyes and get up, but this never worked for me, either I ended up in **SP** or the dream was very unstable. You can try it anyway.

**6**: **Ending The Dream**

Ending dream is very easy. All you have to do is close your eyes and imagine your physical body again. You'll be in your bed in no time. Better perform a **RC** to avoid false awakening and you're IRL again!

This is it! Do give it a try, and feel free to ask any question!

Glad to help! Thanks.

The trick is to establish a simple rule for yourself:

**If I'm not sure if I'm dreaming, then I'm dreaming.**

Forget counting, trying to read your watch, or waiting for weird things to happen... you don't need any of that. All you have to do is ask yourself that question, ""Am I dreaming?"" And because you've rehearsed the rule while awake, and learned to trust it (that's the important part), then fact that you're asking it instantly provides the answer, by the simple act of asking it. (This is because you never actually question reality when you're awake, unless of course you've trained yourself to do it for LD.) 

It takes some practice to trust the rule, but for me, after about a dozen times, it became second nature. MY RC's are therefore very fast and don't disrupt whatever's happening in the dream. 

I'm new to this /r/ and maybe this is old news. If so, sorry. :) But I reviewed some of the recommended guides and none of them mentioned this technique.

I laid down on the bean bag in my dorm to take a nap. My roommate was next to me, on the computer. When I fell asleep and started dreaming, I didn't realize I was in a dream in the beginning. That's how it usually starts I guess. In the dream, I woke up in the dorm, and sat up in the bean bag. The door was open, and there were a bunch of people walking past. I got up to close the door, and noticed another door inside our room. I asked my roommate what the door led to, and she said, ""It's our personal bathroom. We just didn't notice it before.""

I started arguing with her, saying that we didn't have a personal bathroom, it was impossible. We had a public bathroom down the hall. This is when I realized I must be dreaming. I said to my roommate, ""Wait, is this a dream?"" And she looked at me with a serious face and said, ""Yes, this is a dream. You're still asleep next to me on the bean bag.""

Then she came and sat next to me, and tried to have a conversation with me, but I was too preoccupied with the fact that I was in a dream to listen to her. I interrupted her by saying ,""Wait, but if you're still awake, that means you're really not my roommate."" (I was trying to say that my roommate couldn't be in my dream world when she was awake) I asked her, ""Are you my subconscious?"" And she replied, ""Yes, I am your subconscious.""

She kept trying to talk to me, but I got up and leaped for the window, eager to start flying. This is usually the first thing I do when I lucid dream because, come on, flying. But I was nervous because the dream felt super real, so I turned to her and asked if I could fly. She said, ""Sure, but just be careful."" I opened the window and put one foot on the ledge, but then I started waking up. It was the strangest feeling, because I felt my body shift from being ready to leap out the window, to curled up on the bean bag. It was like feeling my body fall back into place, and it made me feel these weird tingles everywhere as I woke up.

We close our eyes and hallucinate vividly, seeing things no one else has ever seen and never will.

And we seek to control it, change it, drive it - *rule it.*

and we do. And that's FREAKING AWESOME.

LD Manifesto
----------
We believe in lucid dreaming.

We believe that every person has a right to control over their subconscious, and that no one should be afraid of their own mind.

We believe in the joy and exhilaration of pure creation, whimsy, and fancy that is allowed by lucid dreaming.

We believe that people have better things to remember from a third of their life than vague images of bizarre circumstances.

We believe that, whenever you chance to sleep, one should always chance to dream.

We believe that the mind should be a retreat of solitude and enjoyment, fueled by lucidity and awareness.

We believe that everyone has a playground, a world, a universe in their brain, and lucid dreaming allows one to partake in and create, not just observe, that world.

We believe that lucid dreaming is the key to unlocking one's mind.

It also has other cool functions like:

* Deep sleep detector, useful for lucid dreaming, can play a noise to try and tell you that you are dreaming
* If you don't want to lucid dream in the morning, it can wake you up during a light period of sleep if you have one BEFORE you *have* to wake up, and feel fresh since you were in a light sleep.
* And a lot more that I can't remember right now.

I was extremely excited when I found out that there's a subreddit for this subject now, in my opinion it's one hell of a hobby to have. How many of your friends can regularly break physics at will? :D Now, what I've noticed on here almost every time I come on is about 5 threads with everyone asking about how to preform a successful Wake Induced Lucid Dream attempt, and questioning why their methods of this failed. So, I'm going to write out a good guide for all you fellow travelers in the hopes that not only can we maybe clear out a little of the clutter, but that some of you guys can actually get on your way to doing this. 

**Note** This is, by far, the absolute *hardest* method of inducing a lucid dream. Just because I'm putting all this information here does NOT mean this should be the first thing you try, or even the fourth of fifth. This method is only suggested for people who have plenty of experience having lucid dreams to begin with. Period. I'm not telling you not to try, I still try, but I'm telling you not to get your hopes up. Until you actually get good at dreaming via an easier method, like MILDing or DILDing, you probably won't make this a consistent ability. 

Okay, so, WILDing! As I've already said, this stands for Wake Induced Lucid Dream. It's called that because it's the ability of staying concious while your body falls asleep, with the end result you conciously entering a dream scape, fun, right? Right. So, let's say you actually are ready to start trying to have some WILD's, what should you be doing? (Aside from already being good at dreaming.) 

Step 1: You need to know your REM cycles. You need to know how long you can sleep and wake up during one of these. These are the periods when you are dreaming. You actually usually only remember the dreams you immediatly wake up from anyway. This is done through trial and error, usually via practicing the Wake Back To Bed method, which generally involves waking up during a REM cycle, and using that to fall in a dream, telling yourself that you'll realize it's a dream. That's what most of you people should probably be doing anyways.

EDIT: The only real way to figure out what your REM cycles are is to wake up at random intervals overnight, and see if you remember dreams. You can google the average time for the first time you should try getting up. Also, the longer you're sleeping, the closer these things get together. (That's actually one of the reasons WILDing works.)

Step 2: Now it's time to actually try. Wake up during a REM cycle? Check.Okay, now you want to lay down, on your back, and remain absolutely motionless, including your eyes. You are going to have urges to move. Your going to have urges to move some body part due to comfort. Your going to have urges to swallow. Your going to have bad itchces. You need to **ignore them**. This is your brain testing to see if you're actually asleep or not. Moving even the slightest bit completely resets the clock on you. What you may want to do at this point is focus on the hypnogogic imagery you may be seeing.

**this is best down after 4-6 hours of sleep. This method is something you should be trying somewhere in the area of 3 to 6 am. This is the only real way it's going to work. Doing this in the afternoon does not work for most people. Doing this right after waking up will not work. Doing this at any random interval will *not* work.** 

Step 3: Sleep Paralysis! You've made it this far? Great! You're almost there. focus on the hypnogogic imagery, the pictures you see. Don't get hypnotized though, this can put you to sleep for real. At this point you should also be focusing on the dreamscape, concentraing on making it form. 

I have to go take a test so I can't right out as much detail as I want, but this is a good groundwork. Post any and all questions and I'll help, and edit this when I can add some more. For now though, this should give all of you a general idea of what you've been doing wrong..

My last attempt to sleep was confounded, as have my previous attempts over the past four days, by an ultra-realistic nightmare. It is similar, I believe, to lucid dreaming, but I find myself powerless therein...

So here goes. I should perhaps warn you, it's quite gory...I guess I'll throw up an NSFW tag or something.

With no knowledge of how I came to be there, I found myself in a dark room. The smell of dead wood is present, like I'm in one of those oldish barns or some such. It doesn't matter. What matters is that I am tied to a table by my neck, with hooks jammed into my shoulder blades. I feel pain that is all too real when I try to move. 

All of a sudden, there's a presence about me in the darkness. It's a man. He makes no noise...not even the sound of breathing. He just stands there, and I can feel his eyes on me for the longest time. And then, I can feel a scalpel entering my arm, just where shoulder meets the arm. The pain is all to real. I can feel the warmth of my own blood running over me. It's intense and painful beyond imagining. 

He proceeds to do this to every one of my limbs, until I have lost my arms and legs, and am covered in my own blood. I wish I could properly describe what that feels like, but words truly fail me. 

I start to lose consciousness, and the man lets out a long exhale. 

And when I wake from this nightmare, I can barely breathe, my limbs all feel numb, and my heart hurts and beats far more slowly than it should.

If it's relevant, I always sleep on my side. I'm almost certain that it's not sleep paralysis. And the truly strange thing about this affair is that it repeats itself, without fail. It has done so for four nights straight now.

So guys, what do you make of it? Is there anything I can do to fight back or otherwise deal with this?

I feel asleep on my couch in my house for a quick nap.

 I was just standing in a house when I realized it was a dream. I can't recall what triggered it but I remember being really excited because it was my first lucid dream. I was walking around the house, opening doors and found a bedroom. I knew instantly what I wanted to do. I conjured up a really sexy man, and we started making out. One thing led to another and we were having sex. He was moaning in pleasure and I realized, I never had sex before. I realized I didn't really know what it would feel like. So I'm on top of him, powering away, trying to figure out how to enjoy it when he starts screaming. For a split second I think its in ecstasy. Then I looked down and his penis is completely mangled and shredded. Blood is everywhere and I realize half of it is missing.

And its inside me.

Then I look up at the guy and he's a little boy. I was horrified, not only did my vagina completely mutilate this penis, I was fucking a little boy. I started screaming then I woke up on my couch. My mom came up and asked me what was wrong. I told her I just has a really bad dream... which made me think about dreaming again. Which made me realize I was in a dream...

I was immediately horrified when I realized I was in a dream again. Then my couch ""moved"" to the house from before. The boy was still in it crying. I kept telling myself that it was just a dream and that I needed to escape. I ran to the front door and opened it and there was a huge cliff on the other side. I feel vertigo like I'm going to fall in. I turn around and the boy is at the end of the hallway on the ground, blood everywhere. I panic.

I start yelling and had repeated false awakenings (This part is extremely fragmented and just filled with overwhelming terror for me). Every time I would wake up on my couch, have a conversation with my mother and realize it was dreaming again. Then bits and pieces of the old dream would keep popping up. I started yelling and thrashing around trying desperately to wake up, or give some sign to my real mother downstairs that she needed to wake me up. I was emotionally torn up, I remember sobbing and the feeling desperation that I felt with every false awakening; combined with the hopelessness that I just wasn't waking up.

After I realized it wasn't working, I found a place in the house and shut the door. I was trying to stay calm and think. I rationalized that this was my dream, so I needed to trick myself to get out of it. I realized that to solve it I would need to talk to someone that I could trust.

I whipped out my cell phone and immediately texted my boyfriend: ""Hey, I'm stuck in a dream. Can you help?""

My boyfriend knocked on the door and I opened it and let him in. He said ""Alright, right now you are too engaged with your dream. You are too involved. You need to do something to bore you out of the dream. Okay, so I brought some dieting books..."" I was immediately offended. ""Dieting?! Why do you think I need to lose weight?"" ""No no no,"" he insisted, ""We just need something to bore you. and the whole counting calories thing isn't really your thing."" ""What do you mean!? I could totally count calories if I wanted to, I just didn't think I NEEDED to."" My boyfriend got really frustrated in the dream and I started getting really mad at him.

Then two IT guys walked into the room. They started explaining computer parts. The last thought I had was ""This is really boring.""

And I woke up.

TLDR; I was trapped in my dream which turned into a terrible nightmare. I made my trusted friend come to me in the dream to tell me how to get out. He told me I had to make my dream boring to wake up. My dream got boring, I woke up.",,True,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_vqxc4,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/vqxc4/lucid_dream_gone_horribly_wrong_freud_would_love/,

We're getting together with **Daniel Love**, author of the book [Are You Dreaming?](http://www.exploringluciddreams.com/), to create a sci-fi web series all about a group of strangers who find themselves inexplicably connected through lucid dreaming.

Daniel, as someone very knowledgeable about the topic, will be our ""lucid dreaming consultant"" throughout the entire production process.

--------------------
**The basic synopsis:**

(**SPOILER ALERT**: If you're interested in this series, you should start by watching its prequel [here](http://finite-films.com/films/anamnesis/))

“[Anamnesis](http://finite-films.com/films/anamnesis/)” (the short film) takes place entirely in the mind of Adam, a young man whose life is flashing before his eyes in the moments before his death. While this might seem like the end of the story, it’s only the beginning.

The web series will pick up right where the short film left off: in the aftermath of Adam’s death and the chain of events that follow. We get to know Hannah, Adam’s fiancee, as she tries to understand the reasons behind his sudden, violent death. We’re introduced to a new cast of characters, including Sean, a lucid dreamer who begins to prefer his dreams to reality; Vera, a fiercely independent tech wizard who is plagued by night terrors; and Noah, a happily married man who has a sneaking suspicion that there’s something wrong with his reality.

Each 12-minute episode of the series will weave together these characters’ respective stories as they begin to realize that they are all connected in a profound way.

I have a lot of trouble falling asleep. It takes me at least an hour if not more to fall asleep, and then I'm stuck in lucid dreams that can leave me feeling exhausted the next day. 

I didn't always lucid dream so much and I was looking for ways on how to do it, like trying the dream diary and stuff. That never worked for me, but here's what did:

I like to fall asleep with the TV(or laptop) on. It helps me go to sleep and also gives me some interesting lucid dreams. When I'm going to sleep, I listen really carefully to the TV. Pick your favourite show/movie and try to follow the conversations in your head as much as you can, and keep the volume low so it won't wake you up. For some reason, sitcoms seem to work really well. When I do this, my lucid dreams will sometimes be the setting of the TV show and a lot of the time the characters will be in there too(this helps me realize that I've started dreaming). The main thing is just really try to concentrate on what everyone is saying and don't think of anything else until you fall asleep and hopefully your dream will just pick up from there.

next, medicine. I used to take prescription medicine since I couldn't sleep, but now I don't. I take just .5 mg of melatonin sometimes. When I take higher doses it makes me feel weird, but low doses of melatonin has always given me extremely vivid dreams. This is what works for me but I don't weigh much at all so you might try some other low dosage.  I also sometimes take 25mg diphenhydramine hcl. It helps me fall asleep faster than melatonin and gives me vivid dreams as well. I never take them at the same time. 

the last tip i have is try these things when you're extremely tired. i lucid dream like crazy when i don't sleep for a whole day. the more exhausted i am, the more lucid my dreams are. 

I hope it helps and good luck :3

You lay the phone on the bed next to you, and the app uses the phone's accelerometers to measure your movements throughout the night. It will wake you up within a certain period before your alarm time if you are in a light stage of sleep (more movement = light stage, less/no movement = REM). You can even graph all this info and add comments/ratings to each cycle.

Just recently I started to try and lucid dream again. Surprisingly, I was able to do that after just one day of doing reality checks. The interesting application of this app to LD is that now I can see a very clear graph of my sleep patterns on nights that I was able to LD. In addition, I can add dream descriptions to the graph the minute I wake up. It serves as both a dream journal and a way to measure my REM sleep.

For instance, last night I had 3 separate, vivid dreams that I remembered. 2 were lucid, 1 wasn't. On the graph of my sleep pattern, there are 3 90 minute periods of little movement (REM sleep). [Image](http://i.imgur.com/Fnwqv.png) . 

This is probably way too geeky to get many up votes, but I couldn't help but share this little tidbit for those interested in getting a little more scientific with LD.

I was and I am thrilled everytime I have the chance to talk to DCs or explore known paths with a totally different point of view. 

Two nights ago, as usual, I focused my mind on lucid dreams. I wanted to go to an astonishing place I dream of every now and then, but instead I woke up in my house. I grabbed my smartphone (it's my remote control, I use it to control time and space) and I looked for an app that could take me to that place. My tongue slips as sometimes happens in dreams, and I don't know why I said ""I want to go to my home planet"". On the screen I could see a space map, lots of little planets and a big one: it's my planet, name's Atlanna. I have to read it twice, I never heard of it before. ATL 1011, Atlanna, and then the little map at the center of the screen. I pushed ""GO"" on my smartphone touchscreen, and everything went black and red. I felt like going through hyperspace, I was still but everything around me changed dozens of times. I could see a volcanic little planet, red and black. I entered the core and I found myself into the depths of the planet, standing in the center of a eight ways junction. I took one path and walked towards the inhabitants of my planet. They were, to my surprise, sofas with eyes. Big sofas with eyes. They started to ""walk"" towards me and one of them said, talking about me ""I never saw one with only one leg!"" I woke up immediately after that, but now I know that for some reason I am a one-legged sofa that came from the dephts of a volcanic planet.

          Purpose:
Give yourself a purpose during these rough times, is your goal to Eliminate all the Zombies or is your goal to Find/Create a Cure?

     Terrain:
Terrain is one of the most important thing during an Apocalypse.

Easy: Spawn yourself on the roof on a high Building Or spawn yourself on a flying platform.

Normal: Spawn yourself in a skatepark, you will see the Positives with that later on.

Hard: Spawn yourself in a jungle with trees high as clouds and mushroom big as you, Never Camp, stay on foot.

   People:
Spawn 5 Friends/Famous people/Randoms/Family Family not recommended due waking up risk. 

Friends: you will most likely know their way to act in certain situations, if not imagine what you think they would do.

Famous people: Spawn only Trustworthy people and not people that appear to be betraders in certain Movies or whatever they are, imagine their way to act, if they're really a coward even if they act Like Chuck Norris in real life.

Randoms: Is it women / Males and what do they look like, what ages hair type, scared or brave etc.

Family: Don't spawn your family Silly! if they die you will wake up either peeing your pants or crying.

It's very important that you imagine your Co-Survivors detailed. try have a good relation with them but not too good, they will sacrifice their lifes for you if you have a good relation with you but if it's too good you will either wake up or get mad in the dream, or even go back in time to prevent it to happend.

   Weapons:

Easy: Spawn yourself with tons of weapons, and if it your first time, give yourself unlimited ammo.

Normal, give yourself 1 or 2 Weapons, No unlimited ammo.

Hard, give yourself a machete

It's very important that you know the weapon well, how much ammo it can take and if it has alot of kick etc.
Do not spawn Call of Duty based weapons, it will 90% Of the time appear a ammo thingy in the left / Right bottom corner. I Spawn my weapons based on a book i rented.

other:

What century is it? I Imagine my apocalypses in either 3080 or 2012 The difference is that in the future the Cities will be more evolved and weapons more advanced.

Is there other survivors? If so are they nice or Evil paranoids?

Yeah, I admit reading about Lucid Dreaming draws your attention. And then you put what you learned into action and soon enough you find yourself lucid dreaming. Now i'm concluding from myself and many people I know, we begin to compare reality to the waking dream world. We begin to say well fuck, lucid dreaming is so much better than real life. *I can finally see my ex after 10 months, I can finally see my brother because he died a year ago.*


 And thats just two examples, i'm sure you have your personal reason to lucid dream. Now, since you understand why lucid dreaming is good you start to *want* more lucid dreams. You feel and know the power you have within a lucid dream, and when you wake up you begin to feel completely powerless. You feel like a puppet playing out your life. You start to look towards going home in the end of the day to sleep, to lucid dream. And that's the problem folks, you rather sleep your life away than to actually live it. Lucid dreaming shouldn't be used to escape the world, lucid dreaming should be used to manipulate the world. You should not be afraid of life, you should not feel powerless because you can't control whats happening. When you lucid dream you are active within right? But compare that to when you're awake, you might be that quiet girl sitting in the corner of the classroom; or you might be that quiet guy that no one wants to hang out with. If you can lucid dream, you should use that as a tool rather than a life.

You should use that to improve you in the real world.

Because the sad thing is, that world we go back to at night is only an experience that was fabricated *it doesn't exist*. Your life right now is real, it is not fabricated (as far as we know). So use your tool to become a better you.

I'm just glad it was only a dream.,JollyRogers1503,265,56,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1g27ix/i_just_had_the_strangest_and_scariest_false/,"It started off as an ordinary dream with my friend and I buying beer and snacks at the liquor store. I forgot my ID. So, I told him to pay for it and I'll pay him outside. We got outside and I handed him a $20. Before he could grab it a gust of wind blew it from hand and the chase was on. The bill flew across the street and into a parking lot. Evertime I went down to reach it a gust of wind would blow it away. It blew over a wall. I jumped over the wall and ended up in a park. I continued chasing it and it ended up getting caught on a tree. I reached for it and noticed it wasn't actually real money. It was a $20 bill printed on a piece of paper. I became lucid at the point, but the dream became unstable and I woke up, or so I thought. 

I woke up on the couch and thought that my dream was pretty wierd, but I knew that I might still be dreaming. I went to my room and there was a pretty red head laying on my bed under the covers. Well it's not everyday I see a random girl laying on my bed so I must be dreaming. I joined her under the covers and start having sex. I tried sticking it in, but she was too tight. I kept trying, but I started feeling myslef waking up and this is where things get weird. 

I woke up with sound of my dog whimpering. I look down and my dick is an inch inside her. Let me mention she is a shih tzu and runt of litter, which makes her smaller than usual and there is no way she can handle human sized dick. I pulled out and noticed blood all over my bed. I was just thinking to myself what the fuck did I just do? I felt a throbbing pain on my penis and soon realized the blood wasn't coming from her. It was coming from me! 

I rushed to the bathroom while thinking to myself she must of bit it, which I don't blame her. In her mind I was raping her. I got to the bathroom to exam it and noticed a huge gash going down my shaft. I was going to need stitches and how on earth am I going to explain this to the doctors. On top of that I'm going to have a nasty scar to remind me of this whole incident. I started to look for something to tie it it up and stop the bleeding, but then I started to feel myself waking up again. 

This time I woke up for real, but I still felt that throbbing pain on my penis. I checked and once I assured my mind everything was okay, the throbbing went away. My dog was peacefully sleeping next to me. It was a huge relief for it all to be just a dream. I thought it was worth sharing since I don't have a dream journal and dreams like this is a rarity for me. 

TL;DR: I was having a dream where I was chasing $20 bill in the wind. I had a false awakening with a chick on my bed and was trying to have sex with her, but I had another false awakening. This time I woke up with dick inside a shih tzu and she ended biting my dick in self defense. There was a big gash on my dick. Then I woke up for real.

1343431633.0,208,self.LucidDreaming,x9uyy,I helped a buddy of mine start LDing in less than a week. Here is how. ,Snoozletoes,252,44,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/x9uyy/i_helped_a_buddy_of_mine_start_lding_in_less_than/,"A week ago my buddy decided he wanted to go lucid, and asked me for advice. First of all I directed him to a few links found on this reddit, as well as the most beginner stuff, because it's impossible to talk to someone who has no idea what you are talking about. 



After he was a bit more educated on the subject I told him to use both these screen shots that were posted on this site a few months ago. 

[Phone Screen](http://i.imgur.com/wLsmk.jpg)

[PC Screen](http://i.imgur.com/U1AlAh.jpg)

After that we place four sticky notes in parts of his house that are used a lot. 

One stick note on the microwave, One sticky note at the bottom of the T.V., Two sticky notes for the mirror in each bathroom. 

I told my buddy to do a ton of LD's a day, told him to try to shoot for 50. I knew he would probably wouldn't take them serious when he knew he wasn't dreaming so I told him to do three. 

1) Count your fingers

2)Close one eye, can you see your nose?

3)Put your hand through your other hand (This is the best one)

I made him do three, so it would be harder for him not to take them seriously. The hand is the best one in my opinion, I find it really hard for people not to take that seriously. 

Six days after he first contacted me, and five days after sticky notes he had a very vivid lucid dream. (This was three days ago)

Since, he has had seven in four nights. He says he sometimes will just randomly remember that he had a LD (We are still working harder on the dream journal, remember this is important.) He also is just naturally going lucid, with only the use of theta beats for memory, and mantras. 

**TDLR;** If you want to LD consistently, start doing a ton of reality checks.  

**EDIT:** Also forgot to add this

Every night before he goes to bed I tell him to write out everything that happen to him that day. His lists started looking like this

I woke up

I took a shower

I brushed my teeth 

etc

They need to look like this

I woke up, my back was sore and it was raining hard outside. 

I took a shower and stubbed my toe on the pot when getting out. The cold water really bothered me that morning, it's probably because the thermostat was low when it rained, making the house a lot cooler. 

My toe hurt so bad as a brushed my teeth, but I think that helped me dig into my mouth more. My teeth felt a little more smoothed and polished after this brush.

For many people Dream Sex often results in prematurely waking yourself up. The key is to take. it. slowwww. Resist the urge to ravish DC's like a horny old rhino, you may get too excited and wake yourself up. So when you decide to get some good ol'Dream booty stay calm and go slow then slowly pick things up if you want to. Also every few moments pick your head up while your doing the dream dirty and take in your surroundings, I find it helps keep me in the dream. So when you decide to go to town on some sexy DC, remember, go slow, stay calm, and lift your head up. 
Other tips I like: Summoning DC's you desire! This is awesome...Find a DC and ask them ""hey do you know where Sexyderpette is?"" or ""hey will you take me to Sexyderpette?"" Usually they will teleport me somewhere and my desired partner will be in front of me, but sometimes they just nod there head and when I turn around, BOOM, there is Sexyderpette! Depending on your mastery or your own style you could just summon DC on command, but this little trick works great for me!

1337706968.0,200,self.LucidDreaming,tzide,A good tip for a better recall of dreams.,achareat,223,23,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/tzide/a_good_tip_for_a_better_recall_of_dreams/,"Until recently I used to write my dreams immediately when I woke up and I have trained a pretty good recall but I have read on the internet to not write your dreams down but instead speak them into a recorder.

I'm always trying what works best for me, so I tried it out. And it works really good. I have better recall now, but the most improvement I've made is on how many and how much of a dream I recall. I used to recall 1-2 dreams every day, now it is 3-4 and they are longer. I can't recall more details of a dream like textures or how people looked, it is a little bit better but not much. 

What I do now is:
1. When I wake up I take my phone open a speak-message.
2. I then tell my dream. (Beware, you just woke up and are groggy so you have to pronounce extremely clear or you won't be able to understand what you are saying later.)
3. When I'm done I put the phone away and get up. I remember some of my dreams every minute so I make a few more messages like this in the next 30 minutes.
4. Now I just go to school like normally and be normal.
5. When I'm at home I find a quiet room and listen to all my messages carefully. (You'll have to find a quiet room or you still won't be able to understand  yourself.)
6. When I've listened them all I now finally write them down in my dream journal.

This works better because you have to move less and you can write it down better when you are fully awake.

I can't guarantee that it will work for you but I strongly suggest giving it a try to see if it works for you. It takes a little more time though, but your dream journal will be better.

Also, I've been eating more fruit lately and it seems it has a positive effect on dream recall. (And on your health :P)",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_tzide,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/tzide/a_good_tip_for_a_better_recall_of_dreams/,

I fell asleep on my friend's couch listening to music and was quickly able to determine I was dreaming.  After exploring a bit the world that was created for me and enjoying myself, I began waking up then going back into the same dream.  Afer a few tries of this the dream changed slightly.

I was sitting outside on a bench with a friend of mine and saw a girl I used to have a crush on.  She walked over and asked if I would walk with her, I said okay and she took my hand.  Trying to talk to her I couldn't hear what she was saying my music was too loud (one way I was able to determine i was dreaming before).  I felt the earbuds in my ears and tried to remove them but after doing so they were still in my ears but also now in my hands.  She thought I was just not listening or didn't care, etc, but then i just kept trying to take them out.  I started screaming ""I CAN'T TAKE THEM OUT!""  And she freaks out, realizing that this world we're in isn't real, she turns away from me, laughing quietly and says ""I know this isn't real, but I just wanted it to be.""  Then her laughing starts getting a bit more manic until it's a joker-esque terrifying cackle.  She turned around with one of the most horrifying, inhumane, insane smiles I've ever seen that was enough to wake me up.  

After waking up on my friend's couch, I finally tried to remove my headphones again, to the same problem as before!  I was still dreaming and couldn't remove the headphones, I could still hear my music!  I spent what felt like a good 30 minutes just cycling through several false awakenings, physically trying to pull myself back to consciousness so I could finally, and actually remove those damn headphones.  

There is no way I will be sleeping tonight, I have never been happier to be awake.  Sorry for the wall of text!

tl;dr: be careful with music while trying to LD...sometimes it can backfire

edit: I took a nap about an hour or two later and just focused on the same kind of shit that got me to LD in the first place (without the music this time) and was able to jump back into the dreams I was having earlier, this time no scariness, just a good ol' time.

Also, this is going to be a long write up with a NSFW dream at the end, so if you want to bail now, I don't blame you.

So I have been trying to go lucid for technically years now. Usually it's a couple weeks of seriously trying at a time, then slacking off for a month or two. In the last couple months I've had a handful of semi lucid dreams where I knew it was a dream, but did not have my wits enough to actually try to stabilize or control the dream. I've tried every method of induction that there is out there (never having luck with FILD.) WILD had never worked before either, but it worked last night. 

I usually only try WILD on the weekends, as I tend to not sleep well after the first initial wake up. But I knew I had today off and wouldn't have to get up and go to work early, so I went for it.  I set my alarm for 5am. I got up, peed, read my dream journal, and went back to bed like 30 minutes later. I laid in bed for what felt like forever, trying to relax my body. After awhile I started to feel the familiar feeling of my appendages falling asleep (I've gotten close with WILD before.) Then I heard the auditory hallucinations  that usually follow for me. This is where I usually lose it and wake up. But I stayed calm. Then I made it to a level that I never have. I started seeing flashes of light. Let me take a step back here.

I have been incubating a very specific dream for awhile now (get to that later.) But about a month ago I read the sidebar piece on VILD, and it suggested creating a transition space, simple in design to initially go into to gain stability before jumping into your exciting fantasies, which can knock you out of a dream real quick. Mine was a plain gray room with a 'dream guide' to remind me on what to do. Now back to the dream.

So flashes of light. I start imagining my transition room and it's like always where I can see it from any angle I want (kind of like forge builder in halo) but I'm not a part of it.

I am looking for the dream guide and don't see anything, when I realize I am now in the room, not floating around it. I've now entered this faux lucidity state that I've had so many times, where I know I'm dreaming, but it's like it's an after thought and I'm not fully aware of what that means. I see the guide. I hadn't thought too much about what he'd look like (to keep it as simple as possible per instructions.) He's sitting indian style on the ground wrapped in blankets and a hat. He stands up, shows his face, aaaaand it's John Mayer. 

NOTE: a couple days ago I looked at an article on yahoo about how he is touring again for the first time since a throat surgery. On the cover of his new album, he's dressed pretty much as he is in my dream. Not that it's relevant but here is the visual: http://i.imgur.com/8abkJjX.jpg

So he stands up, and overly excited to see me. Gives me a big hug. He then immediately tells me to do a reality check and to stay calm if it doesn't work. So I do it. I plug my nose and breathe in. Hey I can breathe. 

Holy shit I can breathe!

John Mayer then tells me to not freak out, and to try and stabilize. I reach down and rub the carpet but it's not really working. The color is getting sucked out of my surroundings. I start to freak out. I rub my hands together and focus on the heat. This is working. The color comes back. I spend the next few moments staring at my hands saying ""stabilize"" out loud. (Read that somewhere.)

At this point holy shit things are vivid. It's like sombody turned up the saturation on everything. Then I realize john mayer is gone. I walk over to the only door and open it. 

2ND NOTE: I've designed a dream and gone over it a million times for this very instance. It is sexual (surprise!). It involves a specific internet model I was really into growing up. If there are any other 27 yr old males here, you might remember Tiffany Teen: (SFW link for the most part http://i.imgur.com/mXFCzRf.jpg ). There is a specific photo set I look through occasionally so I could have a specific referrence of what she'd look like. In the set she's wearing a green shirt, with pink lace panties. Her hair has streaks of brown instead of the pure blond she usually has. I wont link the set here as I'm not sure how mods would feel about that, but PM me if you want the link.

So I walk through the door into a roomy loft on the second floor of a pretty big house. Lots of windows. Cream carpet, tan walls. Tiffany is laying stomach down on the couch (only thing in the loft area) playing with her phone. I walk over and she notices me. She turns over onto her back and rests her weight on her elbows, with her knees up and slightly open. She says something I can't remember what. She's wearing what she was in the photo set, but she has a tanish denim skirt on over the pink panties (not sure why so much tan). Also her hair is platinum blond, no brown streaks like the set. I don't waste any time, and climb in between her legs.

We start kissing. But now that I'm close to her I realize she looks weird. Not like deformed or anything, just...uglier. Messed up teeth, pimples. I reach up and rub my eyes and open them again. She' beautiful again, but Color is fading. I run my fingers through her hair and concentrate on that. Quickly everything is super vivid again. I notice the light coming through the windows is really bright now. I also notice that while I'm still on top of her in between her legs, we are now on a big ottoman, not the couch. She lost her skirt too. I'm afraid that my time is running out so I pull her panties off and sink in (don't remember undoing my pants.) 

I halfway expected it to not feel like much, considering ya know...not really having sex. But god almighty is the brain a powerful tool. This was like super sex. She felt amazing.  So I went at her for a bit from that position, then flipped her over and pulled her to the edge of the ottoman. 

The next position we did was something I've seen in porn but never tried. Where she is on her stomach and her lower half is off the ottoman (or bed or whatever) and your on your knees in between her legs, holding her horizontal from under her thighs while you pump into her. Seems like you'd have to have a pretty long johnson for it to be effective (unless the girl is practically doing the splits I suppose.) But even though I'm pretty average, it was working pretty good (imagine that!)

So I pump into her in that position. Feels crazy good. Pretty much feels like an orgasm the whole time. At some point I realize were both now completely naked, and she's shiny and slippery, almost as if her entire body is covered in baby oil. This doesn't seem strange for some reason.

After a little while longer I decide I wanna cum. So I do. Surprisingly it doesn't feel much better then it already does (which is already amazing.) I just feel my dick get super hard and start shooting off loads of cum inside her. I remember feeling at least a few loads course through me into her, with a few more shot onto her lady bits/stomach (I realize later that she somehow ended up on her back, with no recollection of the transition.) 

So after playing with her lady bits and the cum leaking out for awhile, I put it back in. But this time I can barely feel anything. Strangely enough I don't remember her being very vocal at all before, but now (that I've already came and can barely feel anything.) She's moaning and yelping all over the place. I remember groping her all over at this point, more focused on my hands/ her body than my penis. When I finally look back at her face she's smiling and asks me a question nonchalantly, almost oblivious to me pumping into her. But again, either she didn't actually ask a real question, or I can't remember what she said. It's like I remember her mouth moving, but no sound. I pull out and just kind of lay on her, looking her over. 

I remember feeling torn as to whether I should keep the dream going or exit it so I could remember it better. After kissing her a bit more I stuck my fingers in her and had one more feel before closing my eyes. 

I focused on the feeling of my sheets against my skin. I woke up immediately, but realized it was a false awakening when the light switch didn't work. I really focused hard on hearing my fan (sleep with a fan on at night), and eventually actually woke up with a full hard on.

I grabbed my laptop and typed up a synopsis with as much detail as possible (which a lot of this post consists of.) As soon as I was done with that I went into the bathroom and jerked off. At this point it was about 6am. I ended up not going back to sleep. 

So there you have it, my first true lucid dream. I hope I can recreate the magic again, because it was pretty damn amazing. I'll probably try to go for longer next time, as I found out that I remembered even the very beginning of the dream very clearly.

Each time I've been getting a better grip on them. Anyway, in this dream where I became completely aware, I was in some art gallery and this woman was walking me around showing me all these paintings. Now it was as if things were moving so fast and I wasn't in control with where I could go or what I could do, but yet completely conscious and aware.

I remember seeing this one painting that looked like Adam in the infamous Da Vinci painting. It was amazing the colors and the precision of it. I remember the lady next to me was trying to talk to me but I had to tell her to slow down that I was trying to concentrate. I remember looking at these paintings with the knowledge that this was just a dream, that my brain made all of this. But yet I remember looking at them and thinking 'why can't I be this good of an artist, how come I can't make this no matter how hard that I try? Yet my brain did it, I'm staring right at it, and it's fucking beautiful.'

I remember even seeing one painting in particular that had a green, teal and purple coat, something that resembled cosmic gases, the flow and the blends, over and transparent to all these straight lines that formed a very abstract design. This one painting I thought about more when I woke up. I remember thinking how my brain created this and where those lines and the colors really came from.

Anyway, in this art gallery I suppose it was, I remember getting to a point where I had tunnel vision and was only focused on how I was doing all of this, and really just staring at these paintings. The longer I looked and the more I was able to study them the more intense it felt. How real it all seemed. It was really too much to handle. And I wondered why I couldn't bring it out of me while awake. The beauty of it all. 

I remember feeling as if this lady too was my subconscious. I learned that people or conscious beings in dreams may represent the subconscious mind and now that I go into lucid dreams, the rare occasions that I do, I am aware that that's what it most likely is. I remember starting to hint she knew what I was doing, trying to understand how I did this and how to create art pieces like this while awake. I remember hinting that and asking her.

She was on my right side, and she put her arm around my shoulder and pulled me in and hugged me, a hug that resembled the 'that a boy!' hug, and it actually felt like something divine was hugging me. Almost like.. well scared to say it, but like God was hugging me. That's the best way I can describe it. She said 'close your eyes'.

I remember thinking in the dream this was my subconscious, and I had to ask her or it how to do this, and it said 'close your eyes'. It was an intense answer to be honest. I also knew that that was the right answer. I don't know how I knew, but I just knew. But also wondered 'close my eyes? in my dream?' I did and it all went black and all of these images and colors started to appear. I couldn't even control it.

Then she hugged me closer, almost like she was even prouder of me, and said 'Now look at the brush.'

When she said that I just saw an outline of a paint brush over to the left of my view in what was blackness when I closed me eyes. I got a little confused but felt that there was something behind that answer. But it became so intense, the emotions, I have to admit I became a little frustrated, and it was this that woke me up. I remember laying in bed, fresh right out of the dream, with all those images, the paint brush I ended up seeing, the paintings, the emotions, all of it. 

I don't know though, I'm sure I'll get it eventually. I think I just need to keep looking more and my art work will get better. Lucid dreams really are something.

I'll try to answer everyone's questions. Be sure to read the comments as well!

***Tips***

* If you're in a lucid dream and you start to feel the dream fading away, spin around yourself and look closely at the palms of your hands. As an alternative to this, instead of looking at them, you can rub your hands. It's also not a bad idea to do a RC. This will stabilize the dream

* If you want to fly, jump in the air and then start ""swimming"" through the air. When you get better at it, you'll be able to skip the swimming

* To change your environment, find a door and imagine your next dream landscape behind it, and then walk through it. I don't suggest closing your eyes and opening them to end up somewhere else, because you might wake up(see next tip)

* If you want to wake up from a dream, close your eyes hardly and then open them. I wake up every time I do that.

* Bad things will happen only if you expect them to happen. I've read stories on this subreddit of someones subconsciousness turning into a demon, this will not happen to you unless you expect it. This also applies for sleep paralysis

* If you get overly excited, you will wake up. When you realize you're dreaming, stay calm and stabilize the dream. This also applies for sex. Yes, having sex will wake you up almost immediately. Stick to other things until you get more experience

* Have a dream journal. Most of you already do this, and it helps a lot.

* If you want to get random lucid dreams, do RC during the day. You probably already know this

* Tell people in your dream to remind you you're dreaming the next time they see you. This helps!

* I often get bored while WILDing, and just go to sleep. If you ever get bored, remind yourself how fun LDs are. If you didn't have one yet, imagine the fun things you'll do if you'll do if you don't cancel the WILD!

* Dream control: When you become more experienced, you'll be able to do everything just by thinking about it. However, as a beginner, your dream won't listen to you. A cool trick is to get that remote out of your pocket and use it!

You didn't know you had a dream remote? Yup, it's right there in your pocket! Just take it out and you'll see buttons on it. Press the main button(you'll know the main button when you see it), and whatever you have in mind will happen! Remember, just take it out of your pocket and press the main button! You can try the other smaller buttons as well, they have pretty fun effects. With the remote that's in your pocket, you can do anything! All the fun, just waiting for you in your pocket!

---

***Fun stuff to do when you're in a LD***

* Do whatever you wanted to do! You'll usually have things you wanted to do already in your head. Do them!

* Fly. I've explained flying in the tips

* Portals. Might want to play 2 or 3 levels of portal to get the hang of them, but they're loads of fun!

* Talk to your subconsciousness!(may not be recommended for beginners) Just find anyone in your dream, and ask him something! You can ask it anything, and you'll get an answer directly from your brain! Just be careful, if the character tells you your not dreaming, punch him in the face and go somewhere else.

* Posses animals and people!(the remote may come in handy here!)

* Eat. Seriously, get yourself something to eat with the remote, and spazzam over how delicious it is. I couldn't believe how yummy it was! If it taste good, use the remote!

* Do dramatically epic things. One time I pointed my finger at the sky and yelled GURREN LAGANN! Gurren Lagann's theme song started playing, and it was just awesome.

* Have a lightsaber battle with someone!

* Ask someone in your dream for a fun thing to do. That's basically asking yourself what you want to do.

* Travel to other planets! You can fly to them, or teleport.

* Ask your subconsciousness to tell you something about yourself that you didn't know.

* Find a TV and enter it.

* Have magical powers(cough remote cough)

* Run really fast! You can even break walls with enough speed!

*  Get out your dream journal(do I still have to tell you how?) and read it. Try reading the page that you'd write when you wake up.

* Create an apocalypse and watch it's effects while flying

* Turn yourself invisible(you should know how by now) and mess with other people in your dream

* Bending.

* Ride a dragon

I fell back to sleep around 4:00 a.m., and immediately started dreaming.  I dreamt that my alarm went off and I headed to the bathroom.  When I tried to turn on the bathroom light, it wouldn't work.  Confused, I tried to turn on the hall light and that didn't work either.  I called to my partner, and told him that the power was out.  He called back to me from downstairs and said that the lights were on.  As I was walking down the stairs to talk to him, I did a reality check.  I had seven fingers... I was dreaming!  This was one of those rare and enjoyable lucid dreams that heretofore had been indistinguishable from reality.

By the time I got downstairs, the lights were on.  The Christmas tree was up, and my brother's cat was walking around the living room (he lives half-way across the country).  I looked down and saw two versions of my own cat, and then spent the next few minutes marvelling at the clarity of the dream while stabilizing.  

Suddenly, I woke up in bed.  By now, I've become accustomed to reality-checking immediately upon waking up from a lucid dream.  Unsurprisingly, I had six fingers.  I got out of bed and was disturbed the the darkness of the room.  I tried to turn on the lights, but it didn't work.  I walked to my office and stared out the window, trying to ""pull"" the sun above the horizon.  Although it didn't work as quickly as I intended, the sun eventually rose and the room was bright again.

Then I woke up in bed.  I reality checked again, it passed, so I got out of bed and walked around the room.

Then I woke up in bed.  Again.

I reality checked the got out of bed.  I looked out the window and saw that the landscape had been transformed into a scene from my favourite video game.  I opened the window and pushed out the screen when I froze.  What if I was sleep walking?  I logically knew that what I was seeing was a dream, but my window sill felt so solid and real.  My cat jumped up on the window ledge like she always does.  I could feel the carpet rough against my feet.  I panicked.  Suddenly, my husband yanked me away from the window screaming ""What are you doing?!"", to which I responded, ""I was going to fly"".  

""Are you crazy?  You could have killed yourself!"" He yelled, before embracing me in a tight hug--

--and then I woke up in bed.  Again.  I proceeded to do so again and again, until I began begging dream characters to let me slip into a regular dream and to stop my false awakenings.  Eventually I came across a character who called himself ""Turn"", who agreed to let me fall asleep--which I promptly did.  Like falling out of an airplane, I was slammed into a regular dream with absolutely no lucidity.

When I woke up from that dream, it was 6:30 a.m., and I wasn't entirely certain I was awake.  I reality checked before I got out of bed.  I walked to the bathroom and turned on the light.  I reality checked four ways in the bathroom (finger counting, pinching nose and breathing in, pushing finger through palm, and looking in the mirror).  It was surreal.  Despite the irritation of multiple false awakenings (and twice I woke up in bed frozen with sleep paralysis), it was one of my longest and clearest lucid dreams to date.

1344109085.0,188,self.LucidDreaming,xoko0,Don't really wanna WILD? Here are 7 Pretty New Lucid Dreaming Induction Techniques! (Includes TL;DRs!),Rexq21,253,65,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/xoko0/dont_really_wanna_wild_here_are_7_pretty_new/,"&lt;Note: Here is the [source](http://best-lucid-dreaming-techniques.com), I haven't mentioned all of the techniques listed on the website. You can go check that for yourself! Also, if you like this, up-vote it so that others can see it as well!)

**TILD - Thirst Induced Lucid Dreams.**
The motivation starts because you’re going to basically dehydrate yourself before bed. Don’t drink anything for several hours before bed, so that you become really thirsty. Some people will also eat spicy items before bed, like chili peppers, or salty crackers that make them feel even thirstier.

Don’t do anything to quench your thirst when you fall asleep at first. You’ll want to sleep about five or six hours so you can get out of the delta phase. Then, make yourself wake up. You might need a bathroom break. At any rate, you should fill a glass with cold water and set it beside your bed. Don’t drink any, but just think about how good it would taste to drink the water.



**TL;DR**: Don't drink anything several hours before going to bed and make sure your *really* thirsty! Go to sleep and set an alarm for 4-5 hours after you wake, once you do take a glass of ice-cold water and put it next to your bed. Right before sleeping, imagine how good its gonna taste, but know you won't drink it. If you ever find yourself drinking it, do an RC.



**UILD - Urinate Induced Lucid Dreams.**
UILD is a good way to get into the habit of doing reality checks. We all use the restroom at least three or four times throughout the day. Start by doing a reality check every time you use the restroom, wherever you are.

Then, before you go to bed, load up on water so that you have to urinate during the night. Oftentimes, when you do this, you’ll actually dream of relieving yourself quite frequently. This way, you can remember to perform a reality check when you use the restroom in your dream.

**TL;DR**: Drink *a lot* of water before going to bed but don't go urinate! Intentioanlly fill up your bladder and, again, remember not to go to the bathroom. If you ever find yourself in the bathroom urinating do an RC. After that, summon a woman and have fun! 

**RILD - Reward Induced Lucid Dreams.**
RILD works by simply rewarding yourself when you remember that you are dreaming so that you can have a lucid dream. Rewarding yourself here is a little like rewarding a little kid or a pet. You need to reward yourself immediately after waking from a lucid dream.

What does your reward need to look like? It depends on what you like! Some people keep a special drink or type of food by the bed and treat themselves to a sip or nibble upon waking from a lucid dream. Others might read a beautiful poem on waking, give themselves a foot rub, or do other pleasurable things that are rewarding for them.



**TL;DR**: Whenever you lucid dream, treat yourself to something you like! This will give you an incentive to Lucid Dream! :)



**PILD - Punishment Induced Lucid Dreaming.**
Basically, you need to combine PILD with the stated, spoken intention to become lucid during your dreams. When it comes to dreaming, punishments and rewards are all about your intentions. The harder you intend to become lucid, so to speak, the more likely you are to do so.

So, before you go to bed – actually, all throughout the day – tell yourself that you will succeed at becoming lucid during your dreams. If you don’t, remind yourself that you’ll be punished when you wake up in the morning. It sounds brutal, but your punishment doesn’t have to be severe, simply uncomfortable or annoying.



**TL;DR**: Punish yourself if you don't get to Lucid Dream in the morning, don't make it something severe just make it something annoying.



**LILD - Letter Induced Lucid Dreams.**
Basically, you’re going to pick your symbol. It can be a specific letter, word, or being that you encounter during the day and that might also tend to pop up in your dreams. Not sure what symbols recur in your dreams? Start keeping a dream journal andrecalling as much of your dreams as possible! Since our dreams are made up of mostly things we know and think about during the day, chances are likely that you’ve got some recurring symbols in your dreams like most people do.

**TL;DR**: Pick a letter from the alphabet, every time you see it do a RC. 

**CILD - Clock Induced Lucid Dreams.**

**TL;DR**: (It's very simple) Take a **digital** (NOT ANALOG!!!) watch, look at it, look away, then look back at it. If it changes or what you see is absurd, then it's a dream. If every things normal, you're awake.

**TILD (2) - Totem Induced Lucid Dream.**
(This is not the same as Inception)

Essentially, with TILD, you want to choose a small object you can keep with you at all times. Throughout the day, whenever you see or touch this object, do a reality check. Then, in your dreams, you’re likely to pull out that item and use it for a reality check, so you can have a TILD.

Another way to do TILDs is to use the totem itself for reality checking. If it’s something you always wear, you could do a reality check when you realize you aren’t wearing it in a dream, which is common. You could also choose a totem for TILD with some sort of writing on it. Chances are likely that in your dream, the totem will have different or strange writing on it rather than what you know is actually there.


**TL;DR**: Get a special object, whenever you feel it or see it do an RC; or, put it on your clothes, if you don't see it one day you're dreaming!",,False,,t5_2r0f4,1344109714.0,,,True,t3_xoko0,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/xoko0/dont_really_wanna_wild_here_are_7_pretty_new/,

 I woke up at my regular time of 7am but wasn't going to work since it's a holiday. I went back to bed but instead of laying on my side like i usually do in the mornings, i laid on my back with my arms above my head. Then I maintained consciousness throughout the process of falling asleep reminding myself that I was about to dream. It was fairly easy because it was quick. I imagine it took me less than two minutes to fall back asleep and realize i was lucid. I wasted no time and fucking flew. Through the ceiling of the bedroom, out into the suburbs of Nyc in a bright sunny day. I have experience skydiving so I climbed up at the same pace we usually do in the single prop plane. I could feel the wind and the sun on my face. It probably helped that the bedroom was a bit chilly at the time and i was out of the covers. I kept climbing quickly above the 16k feet I usually skydive from and climbed until I could see the break of the stratosphere. As soon as I crossed that line where the sky goes from blue to the black of space, i got this incredible chill through my whole body and an overwhelming sense of happiness.... Then i thought, i've gotta tell the guys at reddit. And with that thought, i fell out of my dream and couldn't go back. 


So, thank you very much for helping me achieve lucidity and also fuck you for making me want to tell you so badly that i fall out of it. I love this subreddit and come proudly with my first post in the form of a success story.

What you do is set an alarm to go off after you've slept for about 5-7 hours. Then set an alarm to go off about 15 minutes after the first one, and another alarm to go off 10 minutes after the second one.

What this does is the first alarm slightly wakes you up so you can turn it off, then right when you're about to fall back asleep the second alarm goes off and wakes your mind up again, then the same thing happens with the third alarm.(Do this before you go to bed at night, not after the previous alarm wakes you up) 

By the time the third alarm goes off you'll be exhausted and feel like you'll pass out as soon as you close your eyes(which you probably will). This would be a great time to try the WILD method. It worked for me almost instantly and gave me my first LD!

[Here's a pic of what my alarms look like on my iPhone](http://i.imgur.com/gd6d8.jpg)

If it doesn't work for you, try experimenting with different amounts of alarms and different intervals between each alarm.

I just suddenly become aware inside the dream world.

I wanted to mimic a lucid dream scenario in real life so I came up with something called the lucid trance.

The first thing you need to do is get yourself into a deep trance by using meditation. Not meditation where you sit, relax and think. I mean proper meditation where your mind clears and your body experiences a very deep relaxation.

This gives you the same awareness you have inside a lucid dream.

Now to mimic the control part you need to try and manipulate your sensations with your mind. This is actually very easy to do when you're in a deep state of relaxation. Just like you would control things in a lucid dream you can try and make yourself feel like you're spinning around, bobbing up and down on waves, or swinging side to side on a hammock.

I've found by having the awareness + manipulation it's very easy to mimic a lucid dream.

Now when you actually dream you should be used to being so aware in that state that you can become lucid very easily.

And everytime I come to this sub there's at least one if not multiple people talking about how they had a bad time with Sleep Paralysis. About how they saw or heard scary things and they are never going to do it again or its people that want to try it but they are too scared to even try!


This community is like the older sibling or parents telling young kids that there's a monster under their bed or in their closet. And being naive the new comers like the little kids believe these stories! Hell, even in the side bar under SP it says ""Sometimes you may be visited by the dream transition buddies"". The only difference between the monster under the bed when you were a kid and the scary SP stuff is that your parents assured you that there was no monster and they could prove it, so its no longer scary. The SP scary stuff is something that CAN become real. Just like how you control your dream and make stuff happen because you believe it will happen. You are making them believe it will happen, and then it does happen to them. Just like back when you were just learning about lucid dreaming and SP you heard stories or someone told you that it would happen, and then it did!


You know whats happening when you share these stories and say that yes it does happen? YOU'RE MAKING PEOPLE HAVE NIGHTMARES! I've only seen a couple other people say nothing happens. I was fortunate enough when I was younger to experience SP while waking up a couple times to know nothing happened. I also did my research on SP before I found this Reddit. I did not once read that scary things would happen until I came here.


I cant be the only one that knows its mind over mater and believing in it makes it real. I've never heard or seen anything, and I don't think I ever will.

What I want know is if it was so easy to make people believe that scary things would happen to them in SP, if we could make people believe that SP is a awesome experiance. Or at least that its no differnt than falling asleep normaly (nothing happens).

1344219197.0,181,self.LucidDreaming,xqqvi,How I used lucid dreaming to uncover a suppressed memory,coeddotjpg,235,54,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/xqqvi/how_i_used_lucid_dreaming_to_uncover_a_suppressed/,"This is a story about a dream I had, and how I used lucid dreaming it to uncover a memory I had buried. It started with a dream about a woman named Magdelina. It was a love story, one of those dreams that seemed to last forever. We traveled, saw mountains, went on a cruise, met her family. Toward the conclusion of the dream she met me in a park at night. She seemed sinister and frightening. She had a young girl tied up and gagged. Magdelina revealed that she was a spirit in possession of the person I knew and loved. She wanted to be young again, to take this younger body, but to do so I had to murder her current form. She told me that we could be together forever if I just did this one thing for her. Strangle her.


The dream changed to a hotel. It was old, the floors made of cracking wood. There were other men there of various ages, even a boy of about fifteen. Magdelina had been busy it seemed, for many years, winning men's hearts like she had won mine. Then breaking them. She had gathered us because she had an infant. She wanted to live an entire life again. I grabbed the child and fled. I ran to the front desk and implored them to call the police but they refused. Dreams being odd like they are, the police appeared and arrested me. They gave the child back to Magdelina and as they hauled me away she held the infant and smiled a wicked smile.


I woke up and began recording the dream in my journal. I realized that I had seen that smile before, somewhere. Some memory, buried deep and forgotten, had created this wicked dream character. It was still night so I decided I'd go looking for her. I’m no stranger to lucid dreaming so I prepared myself, drank a glass of water, and headed back to sleep.


I was immediately lucid. I was in a house with a family I didn't know. All of the furniture and appliances were pristine and white, like they had never been used. Around me were things from my day to day routine - things from the office, people I worked with, they were playing  video game I’m fond of. I realized that I was still lingering on the surface of my mind and I had to delve lower. I tried something I had never done before, I closed my eyes in the dream and told myself to go back years. I reappeared in the same house but everything was different. Some of the furniture had been cleared out and what was left looked used and aging. There was a party going on with people from all years of my life but also many strangers. I searched the crowd but didn’t see Magdelina.


I walked about the party observing the dream characters. One man I recognized but couldn't place. He had a bemused look on his face, crouching against a wall away from the party goers. This dream character realized that I was the dreamer but wasn't being helpful. I found a pack of yo-yos and took one out, it was red and made of cheap plastic. This stage of the dream is blurry and I didn’t write much, but later as I sat on a couch I realized that three other characters had taken yo-yos as well, and these three men were in the hotel with Magdelina in my original dream. I realized that I was on the trail of the memory and so I tracked the men down, all three were meeting in the basement of the house.


The first man was older, with white hair and beard and a long white coat. For some reason I simply struck him and knocked him out. The second man, about my age and dressed in jeans and a leather jacket, snarled and attacked me. I simply flung him against a magazine stand that was in the basement for some reason. The third I grabbed and lifted by the neck. He wore business clothes, dark navy blue khakis and a light blue collared shirt. I didn’t have to say anything, just looking at him began to bring back some memory.
At this point in the dream I receded in age. It was like I found a younger version of myself, of seven years old, and put myself on like a costume. It was like I was stepping back inside of my younger self to relive a memory. I was in my family’s old home, from before the divorce. It was summer. The front door was open, a screen door separated me from the front porch. A thunderstorm was brewing outside. I realized that we, the children, were alone in the house. My parents were shopping. They often left us alone, with the teenagers to look after us. I wasn’t afraid. Any adult that came looking for trouble would find it. I’d fight and stab and kick. But why? What made me that way?


I was suddenly in the mall, four years old. A department store, Sears perhaps. They had all of the kitchen appliances on display. The glass-faced dishwashers were chugging along, sloshing water and soap around silverware and plates. Somewhere I knew my brother was hunting down a video game display on the other side of the store, where arrays of televisions were glowing blue. I had wandered near the front door.


“Are you lost little boy?” a beautiful woman asked me. She appeared Spanish, olive skin, long curly black hair. Her clothes were pretty, exotic, like she had altered them herself. “Do you want to come with me?” she asked as she clasped me on the wrist. It hurt. I wanted to tell her that I was with my mom and dad but I was four years old and terrified. She was smiling but it was off. There was no kindness in her eyes. Despite the look on her face I knew she meant me wrong and now she was pulling me towards the door. My mother arrived to save me. I don’t remember the altercation but I remember the feeling of relief, the raised voices, my father joining my mother as the woman fled out of the front door. She looked back not at the young four year old me, but at me. I was suddenly in the dream watching everything from a distance. Magdelina smiled furiously and turned, departing back into my memories. I heard a humming sound as the dream decayed around me. It was my electric fan, in real life. I was waking up.


I lay awake for a while reflecting on this memory. This encounter left me doubtful and defensive of people, but on a deeper level it disturbed me greatly and made me feel guilty. Somewhere I know that this woman is still out there. She’s probably in her fifties by now. How many children has she taken? Any? Maybe I was the only one and the experience deterred her from trying it again. But I doubt it. Not the way she was looking at me. And I’ve read about these kinds of people, their sickness and compulsions. I hope that this memory was fabricated but deep down I know it happened.

I wasn't ready to be up yet, but I helped him out with what he wanted, then went back to bed thinking, ""I'm going to be lucid.  I'm going to be lucid.""  I let myself drift off and every time an image or sound started to form, I thought, ""this is a dream."" I had to do this a few times as when I made that thought, I would awaken a bit and the images and/or sounds would fade away.  

Regardless, I kept this up and finally found a world form around me.  At first I had to keep interactions to a minimum as every time I tried to interact or move at all, the dream would pause and begin to fade away.  After a while, I could feel the distinction between my real body and my dream body.  I was aware of my real, physical surroundings, yet I could freely move my dream body and all sensation was transfered through the dream body.  My awareness of my surroundings faded as the dream continued. I was able to fly and mildy control parts of the dream besides myself.  

I had two hang-ups.  Once, I started to lean back while flying and I felt the dream begin to fade.  Another time, I tried to fly through a ceiling, which I had just seen two other DCs do, but I had difficulty and the surface wouldn't let me push through.  I managed to stay calm and I changed the consistency of the ceiling to something more paper-like and was able to punch a hole in it and then push through and catch up with the DCs.  

I remember having the thought, ""wouldn't it be cool if someone else showed up here that was also lucid dreaming and ended up in the dream with me?""  Shortly thereafter, two people whose faces were that of strangers appeared in the dream.

I do believe I have had experience with genuine astral projection, but will not go into that here. Some of those techniques led me to become a serial lucid dreamer which, at the time, was a disappointing result compared to traveling outside of my body. 

For months at a time I was lucid dreaming every night. I do it less now as an adult because I sleep a lot less. As a general rule, the more I sleep the easier it is to enter into the LD state and keep it under control.

I have done it so often that I am having a hard time deciding what to relay other than to share a general word of advice.

In my opinion it is REALLY difficult to make very specific written techniques work for yourself verbatim. I can tell you all of the ways that it has worked for me, but these are either adaptations of techniques I have red about and tried or my own cocktail that I have ""fallen"" into through trial and error. 

I am not saying you should not read up on techniques and try them, quite the opposite. I think the most important thing is to keep trying these different techniques and that general act of striving for the goal will lead to your own path of success.

		Behavior Modification: Lucid Dreaming 



The target behavior for this project is lucid dreaming. This occurs when the dreamer realizes within the dream that they are asleep and dreaming. At that point of recognition, the dreamer “becomes lucid” and can then manipulate their dreams to whatever they desire.

Lucidity is best achieved when the dreamer is making an effort, while awake, to have a lucid dream. These stimuli include reality checks and dream journaling. **Reality checks** are little things done throughout the day that lets the subject know whether or not they are asleep or awake. Here are a few common examples:

**Dot on the hand**: The subject will draw a dot in their palm, and ask themselves throughout the day, “Am I dreaming?”, then they will look at their palm, and if they see the dot, it lets them know that they are not dreaming. Skeptics say that the subject could simply dream the dot in their palm, which would make them think they were not dreaming. However, the whole purpose of a reality check is to get your brain in the habit of asking itself if it is dreaming or not. Thus, by checking the dot on your hand frequently while actually awake will form this habit. This will improve your chances of your brain asking itself if it is dreaming or not while asleep, which will hopefully trigger lucidity.


**Plug your nose**:  Plug your nose while awake and try to breathe in through your nose. In reality, you will be unable to breath and will have confirmed the fact that you are awake. However, in your dream, if you plug your nose and attempt to breathe, you will still be breathing in reality so you will feel yourself breathing in your dream. This should trigger the realization that you are doing something impossible, and that you are dreaming. This also works with trying to breathe underwater in dreams, though it is not suggested jumping in the pool and breathing to test your awakeness….


**Look at/feel your hands:** Not quite sure why this one works, however, I do know from experience that it does. Look at your hands throughout the day and just make sure that you have 5 fingers on each hand and just make sure they look normal. Also, make sure they feel normal. While dreaming, it is not uncommon to dream that you have an abnormal amount of fingers, or that you feel that you have more than the usual ten. 

**Reading text:** Throughout your day, look at any written word, look away, then look back again to make sure it is unchanged. In your dreams, often text will completely change when looked at for a second time.


**Dream Journal**: This is not a reality check, merely something that helps the lucidity process tremendously. Basically, as soon as you can after waking up, write down every detail of your dream that you can remember. Going back over your dreams helps you pay closer attention to detail the next time you dream. During our dreams, there are so many details that should give it away that it is not real, but we simply skip over them for some reason. The closer you can pay attention to detail in your dreams, the greater chance you have of going lucid.

My goal was to fly once I began to lucid dream.

Stimulus conditions were promoted by recording my dreams on my phone each morning that I woke up after dreaming. I would go back to my dream journal right before going to sleep as well, not to read through the journal, but to simply remember the beginning of a past dream, and then I would attempt to recreate that dream in my head, only checking the journal if I got stuck on a detail. This helped to get my brain back in that dream state and to pay closer attention to detail. Also, the dot on the hand, plugging of the nose, and checking of hands reality checks were implemented every day. I actually drew the dot on the knuckle of my thumb, that way every time I looked at my phone for whatever reason, I would notice the dot and remember to go through each of my reality checks. I also created a document in excel that I added data to each morning. I marked down whether or not I dreamt, recognized I was dreaming, went lucid, or if I wrote down my dreams in my journal. This whole process kept my mind focused on lucid dreaming which the most vital aspect of achieving lucidity.

**Results:**


Finally went lucid on my 20th night of this experiment!

**The Dream!**

*I was in some neighborhood in South Dallas, just minding my own business. Then all the sudden, I noticed that several gang members were surrounding me, and I was all by myself. They were not happy that I was in their neighborhood, and I obviously felt extremely vulnerable and scared for what was about to happen. But then my logical mind kicked in and told myself “I would never put myself into this situation in real life… this isn’t real!”, and then my friend’s Lincoln Navigator appeared right in front of me so I hopped in. That part of the dream I didn’t control, but the next part I did. My goal for my lucid dream was to fly, and so I simply put my mind to it while in the driver seat of that car, and took off in the air. I flew it up onto a big building where I parked and got out of the car to photograph some really cool graffiti that was up there. Then when I was done and ready to fly back down, the Navigator wasn’t up there any more. But since I had control of my dream, I just created a blue umbrella right in front of me, grabbed the handle, popped it open, and jumped off the roof and floated down Mary Poppins style.*

I’ve gone lucid only once before, and that time it happened after I felt my hands and realized I had six fingers on one hand, but this time it didn’t require a reality check at all… my mind just realized I was dreaming and it was as simple as that. But that was certainly a result of the constant reality checks I did throughout my day, training my mind to ask myself whether what was happening was real or not. My first lucid dream happened after a month of reality checking, and this one happened after three weeks, so it certainly takes some time to happen, but that may just be me. Everyone’s mind obviously works differently, but the point is don’t be discouraged if it takes you a while to achieve your first lucid dream.

Follow these steps if you want to lucid dream every week:

1. Every half hour stop what you're doing and look around. Ask yourself clearly ""Am I dreaming or awake?"" Try to remember how you arrived there and everything you did at least 2 hours before in order. Eg.: ""Today is Tuesday, I am on the bus going to school right now, before I was waiting for the bus, before I was at my house, before I was eating breakfast. Therefore, I must be awake. If I was dreaming, I would be conscious right now."" It's important that you take some time into this (at least 10 seconds). Many times I took the wrong conclusion thinking I was awake when I was actually dreaming because I didn't ""care too much."" You must CARE! And the best way to care is to stop what you're doing and look around for at least 10 seconds. You must remember what you did. Don't just try to compare with reality. If you ask yourself every half hour, you will make it a habit. That can take 3 or more months, but it will eventually become a habit. Once that happens, you will start asking yourself the same question in the dream. When you do, it might actually be funny because you might remember that half hour ago you went to sleep, so you must be dreaming (its MUCH harder to remember what you did while dreaming). Usually knowing that you're dreaming is enough to make you aware for at least a few minutes. If even knowing you're dreaming can't make you aware for more than a few seconds, you gotta work on your concentration skills (go meditate, train martial arts, or whatever).
**tl;dr: Try to remember how did you get there all the time in your daily life.**

2. If you don't want to keep asking yourself every half hour, try to ask yourself if you're dreaming always after a specific event (like every time you want to go to the bathroom). That usually works. So, to lucid dream you just have to drink a lot of water to induce a dream where you want to go to the bathroom (making you ask the question while dreaming). Again, that has to become a habit first. It can take a few days or months.
**tl;dr: Ask yourself if you're dreaming always after a specific event.**

3. You must be rested to lucid dream. I've never heard of anyone lucid dreaming while tired. So, if you're in sleep deprivation, forget it. I have to sleep 10-12 hours/night if I want to lucid dream.
**tl;dr: Be well rested.**

4.  If you want to be aware, you have to stop distracting yourself with what you see in the dream. It's easier to lucid dream when you're more introspective and introverted. Sometimes we are rested but still unconscious because we are too caught up to the events happening in the dream and forgetting about ourselves. So, you should focus more on yourself during the day.  Dreams are always fast paced. You never stop, and the KEY is TO STOP. How many times during the day you stop to hear you breathing or your heartbeat? If you do that in a dream, you're likely to realize you're dreaming.
**tl;dr: Don't let the world make you forget about yourself.**

4. Before going to sleep tell your subconscious you want to lucid dream and will remember everything. Leave pencil and paper close to your bed. When you wake up, write everything you remember from every dream you had (keywords). You should have a dream diary to improve your dream memory. Keep reading it. It's fun to remember dreams from years ago. And your memory will improve.
**tl;dr: Wish to get lucid and always write your dreams.**

5. Depression can prevent you from lucid dreaming, as drugs, sleeping pills, alcohol, stress, guilty, traumas, fear, or anxiety.
**tl;dr: Be zen.**

6. While lucid dreaming, don't play the hero. Be always in mind that you will lose your precious awareness at ANY TIME (one distraction and you're dreaming again). So, don't play the hero staying lucid dreaming for hours or you might just start dreaming again and forget everything in the morning. After 10 minutes lucid dreaming, that's more than enough! Wake up before you lose your conscience. Your average time lucid in a dream correlates to the average time you can focus without getting distracted. Keep looking at the wall and count in the clock how much time you can stay staring at a boring wall without spacing out. That's around the time you can lucid dream (it's usually around 10 minutes, but with practice you can do it for several hours).
**tl;dr: Don't stay lucid dreaming for too long. Wake up before you forget.**

Came in the mail today, quicker than I was thinking it would after I got the shipping confirmation. Seems fairly nice. There's an insert with info on Remee and how to program it and change brightness, etc. looking forward to trying it tonight. Anyone else get it yet?

EDIT:

Just a quick update for anyone that reads this- I tried it last night, and unfortunately no LD. Actually, no dream at all that I can recall :(
It was set to go off around 4:30 am, based on the delay and when I went to bed. I ended up waking up around 3:30 and dozed back off, then awakening again mere minutes before the LEDs started flashing- they flashed while I was still awake. I kept it on in case it would go off again when I fell back asleep, and they did go off again (not sure how much later) but I was awake again.

A few comments on the device itself- it smells like a new pair of shoes. Random fact for everyone. It's very soft and laying on your side or back is pretty comfortable. I don't tend to sleep on my stomach, so I'm not sure how that would be. It stays on fairly snug and feels mostly like any normal sleep mask, so that's cool. The velcro on the band is really strong, so it feels like that won't wear out. I'm happy with the build quality, just hope that it will go off while I'm dreaming.

I don't judge women on a scale of 1-10, I don't try to hit on anything that moves, and I don't treat women like objects.  But this is a perverted dream, and for some reason, I operated under perverted logic that I would never espouse IRL.

**First dream:** I was sitting in front of my computer, I could feel the keys under my fingers, I could feel the carpet and the tables.  Everything I felt was *completely* real, it was unbelievable.  I opened the door and ended up in the hallway, then opened another door to go outside.  People started appearing.  I looked at each one - everyone looked perfectly normal, especially the women - some were slightly pretty, some were not.  

I started grabbing each woman that passed by, just to get a look at them.  I kissed them, even though one of them was old, another one was ugly, and another one had her boyfriend walking right next to her.  I knew at this point, in my dream-state, that I wanted to have sex with at least one of them.

Finally I found a girl that I deemed ""attractive"" enough, and found a tree trunk in the middle of the road.  I threw her against the trunk, ripped off all her clothes, pressed the tip of my shaft into her wetness, and then... all faded to black.  

**Second dream:** I was in the gym with a couple of guys just lounging around and staring at me.  There was this annoying jazzy song playing in the background, and I couldn't move at all, except my legs felt like the muscles themselves were moving.  Suddenly the music stopped, and I was able to move.

So I started walking around, and again, tried to grab girls that were nearby to force them to give me a blowjob.  The first three girls were not attractive enough, but finally I found this blonde one who maybe would rate an 8/10, (no 10's appeared in my dreams), and she got on her knees and began sucking.  Amazingly, it felt like actual oral, and somehow my penis was about 3 inches longer than usual, but not wider.  I tried to make it wider, but the size did not change *during* the actual dream.  

Unfortunately, 15 seconds later everything faded into black and I was out of dreamland again.

---

I'm not an experienced lucid dreamer, this is my first time actually entering this dreamland.  Two years ago, I started noticing that when taking quick naps in the early morning, I would start seeing very vivid images of random things - a baby stroller on the sidewalk, an old, furnished room, shadows of monsters and forests teeming with life.  But these images flipped by as if in a slideshow - I never could interact with them.

I always knew about this subreddit, but never made an active attempt to enter dreamland, probably because I always assumed I would fail.  However, a few weeks ago, a pictorial on /r/youshouldknow on luciddreaming sparked my interest and I clicked into it.  I read the pictorial, and then thought nothing more of it.

After I woke up this morning having dreamed those lucid dreams, I *had* to post my experiences on here.  Excuse my shitty writing, I'm a terrible writer.

For a really long time I have had a very difficult time staying in dreams and I think other people suffer from the same problem.  So a few weeks ago I tried changing my dream mentality. 

 Instead of trying to change the dream and to do what I wanted to do *cough* sex *cough*, I decided to **just go where the dream takes me**.  This is the key to staying lucid.  If you try to dictate the dream too much you will end up overloading your mind and your body tries to reset.  Before I figured this out my lucid dreams would be very strange, normally they would be in an enclosed environment where I did not have the freedom to leave. As soon as I would try to get the dream going, some event would happen that would jump me to the next scene [I would usually cycle through about 3-5 scenes until I woke up].  Normally this would be something like closing my eyes and reopening them in a false awakening to try to trick me into losing my lucidity. Once I started going with the flow I can move around and experience the dream as I please and as long as I don't try too hard to mess with things, then I can stay in the same scenes.

So basically my advice is not to get too wowed by all the stories in this subreddit.  Don't try to immediately fly out of your dream environment to go fuck shit up.  This will usually end in your body making you fall and having you either wake up or give you a false awakening [which is very deceptive because everyone has stories of people who fall to their deaths in dreams and wake right before hitting the ground]. 

I'd like to give one more thing that I've learned as I've become a more experienced dreamer.  About half of the posters on this subreddit are full of shit.  Do not believe everything you read here because people love making up dream stories that people who do not know what lucid dreaming is like will believe.

I hope someone found this helpful because I wish someone had told me this earlier so I wouldn't have wasted so many of my early lucid dreams. ",,False,,t5_2r0f4,1356557514.0,,,True,t3_15hcay,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/15hcay/the_real_trick_to_staying_in_a_dream/,

They were usually variations of getting trapped, lost or abandoned in my grandmother's farm house.  Things like falling through the cold air return grate and getting trapped in the furnace or suddenly finding the house empty and running up and down stairs looking for my parents.

When I was around 10 I had my first lucid dream.  The familiar nightmare started and I was running up and down stairs and I suddenly realized the stairway was too long, it wasn't really my grandmother's house and this was a nightmare.  I stopped running and went to find my parents, kind of willing them to stop moving.

I asked them why they were abandoning me and my mom said, ""We haven't abandoned you. We're looking for Lisa.""

My sister Lisa died of SIDS at my grandmother's house when I was four and a half.   My parents, taking poor advice from everybody, didn't take me to the funeral or wake or allow me to see the ambulance removing Lisa's body. As far as four year old me knew, you could simply vanish in grandma's house. Now everything made sense to 10 year old me, and the nightmares stopped immediately after that.

For any of you who are having a hard time getting lucid I would highly recommend ordering some of the ""dream herb"" I'm at work and cant recall the whole name of it, but just google ""dream herb"" and you'll find it no problem. 

Basically I bought 114g of it for about $30 including shipping. Last night I slept for about 7 hrs then ate about 2g and went back to bed. Holy shit! It was the most vivid and realistic lucid dream I've ever had. Flying, telekinesis, bending matter to my will. It was absolutely awesome. Like I said I'm at work atm so when I get home I'll update this with the Latin name of the herb and more on my dream! Have any of you tried it before? If not do it!

EDIT: It's called [Calea Zacatechichi](http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/calea-zacatechichi.html)

EDIT: No it's not illegal, or at least I didn't have any trouble getting it. I bought it in just loose leaf form from this site: (http://www.botanicalspirit.com/dream-herb-whole-leaf-organic)

Update: last night it worked just as well! I even had 2 friends over last night who tried some as well... And it worked for them too! It seriously makes lucid dreaming really easy. That being said I'm still a noob at this shit and am having a hard time trying to properly fly, control things etc. But I was again amazed by how real everything looked, this time I was in an airport terminal during Christmas time. Haha not sure where that setting came from but it was so awesome. I find it easy to conjour things up if I'm around a corner and wish it into being while I can't see it, then walking around the corner to find what I made, which included a robot this time. (he had a jetpack for me, fucking bad ass right?!) 

But I also made a fire pit, and it was so intense how real the fire looked, everything from the glowing coals to the half burnt logs that had distinguishable burn lines and bark. I then proceeded to like pull the fire out from the pit and into my hand like magic kinda shit. I actually felt hot at first! Then I like suppressed the fire energy into a bright little ball of light.

Oh also, a lot of you are asking/taking about smoking it. last night before we went to bed the 3 of us split a regular sized joint of it. I dont think it was enough for 3 ppl, plus I find this stuff works best with WBTB after at least 5 hours of sleep. But it didn't taste too horrible, little harsh though.

Long story short, I was on the top of tall building, downtown in a city I never knew, and had just killed the kingpin of a large cocaine distribution ring.  Upon receiving verification that I was to be named the new head of this operation, I realized that maybe something was off.  

Previously, while I was awake, I had read that in order to have a lucid dream, an individual must first realize they are in a dream.  It goes on to say that a good way to realize that an individual is in a dream is to point out various oddities in the dream that don't jive with the real world.  Some good examples would be skewed laws of physics (i.e. ability to fly, inability to stop running, etc.) or continuity errors (i.e. people and locations inexplicably changing, change of storyline, etc.)  Using those two fairly simple ideas, I began to analyze my own dream from within.  One thing that struck me as particularly odd was the way every house I visited had the exact same symmetrical layout, which was actually a combination of my parents first and second house.  Another oddity was that I seemed to experience a jumping effect from event to event.  I was in one place, talking to one person, and as soon as the event had completed I would jump to the next event.  The dream appeared to remove any unneeded filler, and instead skipped to the pivotal plot points.

So, as I stood on the top of this building, it occurred to me there was high likelihood I was in a dream.  Of course, naturally, I decided to defer from the seemingly pre-determined dream path and explore this dream world my mind had created.  Needless to say I survived the mighty fall from the top of the building, again, by almost ""jumping"" from scene to scene.  Once on the ground of this city, I took a look around.  This city, which I felt I knew, looked very peaceful, shrouded by the night with the gentle pitter pat of the rain.  Reflections of the lights bounced off the pools of water.  Pristine in appearance, the city was quiet, without motion.  Which got me to thinking, ""If I'm downtown, in a large city, surrounded by tall buildings, how in the world is nobody around?""

This is where I broke dreams.

I started wondering, thinking, how far are the limits of this city?  How far has my mind created this fictitious world? Using video game terminology for a second, where was the edge of the map?  So I started running and, unlike real life I felt no fatigue, and eventually hit the end of the road.  There was no road further forward, just tall brick buildings blocking my path.  Yet, this was not the oddest part.  Lining the alleys and sidewalks of this last remaining road was everyone I had ever seen or met.  Motionless, blank faces, standing rigid.  Staring into nothing, they  crowded up and down the road as far as I could see.  Out of curiosity I approached a cluster.  When I got near enough, they seemed to activate and fill with life.  ""Hey, Man!  How's it going?"" they would say, smiling and waving.  Running away made them deactivate. It was super effing creepy.

I'm not one to hang around creepy places so naturally I did what I would normally do.  Push on further.  This being a dream world I knew nothing was real.  I figured the walls shouldn't be real either, so I walked up to a wall and simply pushed my way through it.  On the other side, nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  You know in the movies when a character access' their own, or somebody else's, dream, and everything is white except for the lonely body of the character? (good examples are the dream episode of Spongebob or the imagination Episode of Adventure time)  That's what happened.  Nothing but white space, everywhere.  My brain had not created a world for this place, so I guess it makes sense that nothing would be there.  However, I could not enjoy this wonderful broken place, as my mind began to create a new world around me.  Upon seeing metal girders and people flood this once empty space I woke up.

I figure, and bear with me, that the mind creates these dream worlds because it constantly needs to perceive a concrete place, something familiar and with limitations.  Why it needs to, I don't know, I haven't figured that part out yet.  When I first began to tear away from the dream path, characters would constantly call out for me, begging me to come back.  As if they needed me to stay and do whatever it is they needed me to do.  Similarly, the dream world would try to change around me, again trying to force me back into the course of action.  Once I resisted enough, and reached the edge of the dream, where my mind had  ceased to envision further space, I ran into everybody I had ever seen or met.  If you've seen inception, which I'm sure you all have, you remember the part where Leo is explaining that the mind populates the dreams with people it remembers. That's exactly what happened.  My mind had populated the world with everybody I had ever seen, but, because they were not useful in this current dream, placed them all in a storage like space where they could pulled from if needed.  I found this place.  My memories would become activated when I approached because they would now be active parts of the dream, currently involved with my progression.  Similarly they would deactivate when I ran from them because they were no longer needed. 

The part where I broke out of the dream blows my mind the most.  Since my mind had not planned on creating anything outside of it's city, there was nothing there.  Absolutely nothing.  It's not the nothingness that gives me the heeby-geebies, it's the speed and efficiency of my mind to create a secondary world around me.  It needed to perceive a concrete place.  My mind would not allow me to explore openly, and  I have no explanation for that.  For whatever reason, my mind needed to keep me inside that dream, doing everything it could to keep me inside.  Yet, when I escaped, it continued it's desperate attempt at keeping me inside by creating a whole new dream around me.

I can't explain it, but it blew my mind.  If anybody has any questions or comments, feel free to bestow them upon me.  I would love an explanation if anybody has one.  I figured this belonged here as it was a lucid dream, and if anybody had any explanation it would be one of you guys.  It may be outside the realm of science, but I felt this was the best place for it.

Thanks for reading!

If you didn't TL;DR: I had a lucid dream where I attempted to escape from the pre-determined dream world.  Ended up finding a storage for everyone I've ever seen.  Once I broke out, I was in a endless white space where my mind began creating a new dream around me.  I woke up, my mind sufficiently blown.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_yuj72,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/yuj72/i_think_i_broke_dreams/,

* **D**ream **I**nduced (a DILD)

or

* **W**ake **I**nduced (a WILD)

There are no other options than these to categories. These are *types* of lucid dreams. You either fall directly asleep into a lucid dream, or you become lucid while you're already dreaming. There are, however, different *methods* of achieving one of these. Let's go over the main DILD methods first.

**DILD techniques** aim to make it more likely that you will become lucid *while you are already dreaming*. You can categorise DILD methods.

You want to increase your **Awareness**. If you're more aware in your waking life, you will also be more aware when you're asleep -&gt; lucid. Methods for improving awareness are:

* [Reality Checking \(RC\)](http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/reality-checks.html)
* [All Day Awareness \(ADA\)](http://www.dreamviews.com/induction-techniques/113253-all-day-awareness-dild-tutorial-kingyoshi.html)

You want to increase your dream **Recall** to remember more dreams and make them more vivid. That will make it easier to become lucid. Methods for improving recall are:

* [Keeping a Dream Journal \(DJ\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/search?q=dream+journal&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all)
* Eating certain vitamins and medicines ([melatonin](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/search?q=melatonin&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) &amp; [B's](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/y69rd/how_to_significantly_increase_your_chances_of/))
* [Cycle Adjustment Technique \(CAT\)](http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/cycle-adjustment-technique.html)

The last category is **In Bed**. These are *short term*, while the others are about developing long term skills. You perform these techniques when you're laying in bed and they work because they make you focus on lucid dreaming. 

* [Wake Back to Back \(WBTB)](http://www.dreamviews.com/wiki/WBTB-Tutorial)
* [Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams \(MILD)](http://www.dreamviews.com/attaining-lucidity/103264-how-mild-stephen-laberge.html)

**WILD techniques** aim to induce dreams from a waking state. You basically lie still in bed while maintaining your awareness until you fall asleep consciously, thus directly entering the dream lucid. Every single [WILD](http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/wake-induced-lucid-dreams.html) technique is essentially the same. However, some people like to move their fingers while they do it. They call it [FILD](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1djly9/fild_works_everytime/). Some people like to count: [CILD](http://www.dreamviews.com/attaining-lucidity/116641-counting-your-way-lucid-dreaming-technique.html). Some people like to visualise pretty images: [VILD](http://www.dreamviews.com/wiki/VILD-Visually-Incubated-Lucid-Dream). Some people like to tickle their little toe while singing the national anthem: [TLTSNAILD](http://www.amazon.com/Exploring-World-Dreaming-Stephen-LaBerge/dp/034537410X) It's all the same thing, but nobody does it the same way. You just have to find your own way of doing it. 
The only WILD 'technique' worth noting is dream chaining, or **[DEILD](http://lucid.wikia.com/wiki/Dream_chaining)**. It's WILD'ing made a bit easier by doing it right after you wake up from another dream.

 
Every other vague acronym you come across is one of these things, but with a microscopic little twist about it making people think it deserves a name on it's own. I really hope this makes things a lot easier for beginners to understand the various methods. I remember when I was new to this and was confused as hell and discouraged, so I wrote this to help others.

They happen more often during the day, on weekends, so I try my best to use them to my advantage. They aren't negative, or haven't been so far. It's terrifying when it happens at night though.

Anyway, this morning I woke up at around 7:30 and, because it is Saturday, decided to go back to sleep. I expected some pretty cool dreams because this is usually a scenario where I have my best lucid experiences. 

I dreamed an entire relationship. I'm not even kidding. It was amazing, and heart wrenching, and confusing. I started off with a typical lucid dream, but I quickly lost that lucidity once I started getting into it. I didn't want it anymore. 
This was the most attractive guy I have ever laid eyes on. It felt like months that I was with him. We met at a museum, and went on dates, and learned about each other. We kissed and had sex, and went on adventures. We fought, we broke up, we got back together. We fell in love. Throughout the dream he kept morphing. Mostly, he looked realistic, but at times he looked quite cartoonish. Sometimes I could feel him and not see him. I could close my eyes and go to sleep in the dream without waking up in real life. It was very weird. 

I woke up after all this and realized he was kind of a jerk anyway. Typical. But I loved my dream boyfriend, and now I feel like a total freak. 

The lucidity varied throughout the dream as well. Sometimes I could talk to dream figures and say, ""Look, I can fly! This must be a dream!"" But other times I was completely unaware. This was mostly when I was being really intimate with  my ""boyfriend."" I guess it would have messed with the dreams stability if I hadn't been convinced that it was real life.

I woke up convinced I had been sleeping for at least 48 hours. I was in the hospital, I must have been in a coma or something. But no, at least three months all condensed into one morning. Wild.

I read into a few threads of people that are using reality checks and just wanted to share the one that I use (which always works).

* Pinch your nose and try to inhale.


In the real world its obviously quite impossible. In a dream you will be able to breath through it.

I love it because it takes less than a second, and is very effective.

 
In case you struggle with keeping up reality checks I suggest that you buy a watch that has a vibration function. 

Set the watch to vibrate every hour (or every two, whatever works best for you)....

It will create a steady pattern of reality checks and the chance of you doing one when you dream increases drastically.

Bonus of having a vibrating watch is that it will also vibrate when you sleep, but instead of waking you up, it can remind your body of doing reality checks.


Thats it. 

I hope this will work for some of you !

You don't need to start by keeping a journal if you don't want to, I personally don't but it will help you to recall your LD experience when you awake.
What you could do instead is make it top priority that when you wake up, to try to remember as much as possible.  if you don't have good recall skills then You should probably keep a journal.

**OKAY**  **This is what worked for me**

throughout your day you will need a reality check, the best one so far is the finger counting one(count your 5 fingers, and then confirm) do this anytime your in a stressful situation or when you aren't sure of something so that you can naturally implement it in your sleep

*(WBTB) wake back to bed. Set an alarm clock, to about 2-3 hours before you normally  awake, once you awake, go eat a small healthy snack and drink a glass of cold water, or cold milk. try to stay up for at least 30 minutes, and then go back to bed, don't force yourself to fall asleep, just let your mind drift and keep telling yourself that you will have a lucid dream and be sure to do a reality check! so that you can become lucid.

you try this at least 3 times, guaranteed to work!

---------------------


Ok little brothers and sisters, many new people around and there are a lot of stories and myths of the Shadow People and company going around in this subreddit.

I will try to dispel these myths so think of me as the [Dayman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLRUMHSst2Q): master of Karate and friendship for everyone!

-------------------------------

So seriously now, you want to LD but are afraid about nameless horrors from the depths of your subconscious or other planes of existence, ghosts, bloodsuckers and scary old people that smell of cabbage. You should not be afraid of these things appearing because there is a trick that I will tell you that never fails (it has never failed me since I figured it out).

These things are ALL in your head. They are figments of your imagination and if you know that, if you are conscious of that then you are not afraid of them. And if you are not afraid of them then they will not appear, or if they appear you can just laugh them off.

Imagine if you saw some scary guy right now next to you. You would freak out because you KNOW you are awake. Right?

But what if you KNEW that you are sleeping? what if you KNEW that you are GOD of this place and any motherfucker that tries to mess up with you will get what they deserve because it's your OWN WORLD and you can do whatever the fuck you want in there. There is no fake ass nightman that is going to scare you man, you KNOW you are dreaming, he's not even real. Don't even worry about him, just tell him ""whatever"" and go bang a hot guy/lady or something.

This subreddit has a morbid fascination with this ""scary"" shit just because most people here have not had a proper LD and they are talking about experiences of being in a very vivid asleep/awake phase but NOT KNOWING they are dreaming.

So my 2 cents of advise so that everybody is clear. If you see some crazy shit, do a reality check right there, proceed to kick ass and take names. If you feel ""frozen"" then chill out, you have waken up but your asshole brain is taking some time to realize it. You will be fine in 5 seconds or so. Try something for me if you find yourself in this predicament. Try to jetisson yourself through the wall that is on the head of your bed. It has worked sometimes with me and it brings you in an LD instantly (I love going through walls anyway).

So please Keep Calm and Carry on. And don't hate on the [nightman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE6GC47NxgI#t=2m39s) dude...

Happy dreaming every one!

I've had many lucid dreams but this one seems utterly impossible and i never thought that it could even happen. I'll try to make it short.

I visited a strange museum with some other people when it hit me that i was dreaming. The legend plates seemed normal from far away, but when i moved closer they were unreadable and kept changing languages every split second.
I thought that i should probably do something productive because i've had no lucid dreams for a long time(i stopped writing a dream diary and doing reality checks). I wanted to draw, so i walked down the museum and after a short while i found an art studio.

I searched for blank sheets of paper and picked up a pile, but they weren't empty- there were already drawings on them. This really annoyed me and i searched further, but there wasn't a single blank paper in the entire room.

Then i started too take a closer look at the drawings- and i almost woke up from the shock. Every single drawing was made by myself and there were probably hundreds of them in the room. And now comes the really interesting and impressive point- i had never, ever, painted any of them. But i knew they were mine, i recognized my style, my flaws, everything, they were even done with my favorite pencils.

I still can't wrap my mind around how this was even remotely possible. Those weren't just rough ideas of possible future drawings, they were fully drawn and finished. After i realized that this was a unique moment of creativity i knew that i had to copy atleast some of them. I was pretty sure that i'd remember almost nothing when i'd wake up. I found a marker pen, picked up a random drawing and just started to portray it on the white wall(because of the lack of blank sheets of paper).

I woke up after i drew a few lines and like i had thought, i forgot almost every detail about the drawings. But i wasn't sad, i was happy that i could experience this. Now i'm really motivated to pick up my dream diary again and to start lucid dreaming more frequently because i'm sure i can go back to this place again and hopefully study more of the drawings.

For those that aren't aware of how sleep cycles work, here's a basic sleep cycle graph for a normal 8 hour sleep:

http://www.luciddreamexplorers.com/dreamscience/sleep_cycle_REM_8_hour_graph.jpg

As you can see, for the first 5 hours, your body gets all of it's necessary deep sleep (which is why a lot of people can run on 5 hours, though it's still not very healthy). However, as you sleep longer, your sleep becomes more shallow, and you have longer and more frequent periods of REM sleep.

1368067045.0,152,self.LucidDreaming,1dz6c9,GUARANTEED LUCID with FILD and The Timer Method,BeaconOfBacon,184,32,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1dz6c9/guaranteed_lucid_with_fild_and_the_timer_method/,"**Video at bottom in case you don't want to read.**


So lately FILD has taken over this subreddit and has a great success rate. I learned about the timer method a long time ago and it made a lot of sense. I realized this method and FILD would work great together.


This is the timer method


1) Go to bed at your normal time and set your alarm clock for your normal WBTB time.

2) Set an additional alarm 8 minutes after the first, then set another 4 minutes after that alarm, then 8 min. after, then 12, then 16, then 20. After that you can keep going as long as you want with intervals of 8 minutes.

**Example:** Go to bed at 10, I would set alarms for 4:00, 4:08, 4:12, 4:28, 4:48, and then maybe 4:56, 5:02, 5:10 [or 8 minutes until I was ready for sleep])

You want to be able to set up the alarms so you don't need to move to shut them off. How this method works is by keeping your body hovering in between states of awake and asleep. You will fall asleep and be woken up by the timer. You just have to relax, and focus an staying alert. If you fail and fall asleep, no worries the next timer will wake you up and you can try again.


The time is set up in those specific intervals because after a few short timers your body will start expecting a beep keeping you even more aware and alert in the dream state. This is a great method to become familiar with the feelings associated with falling asleep, and a great method to get a lot of WILD practice in under a short amount of time.


This is where FILD comes in. Simply use FILD at every alarm to give yourself a much better chance to WILD. Experiment each time you wake up in order to find the method right for you. Good luck!

[Video explaining the method if you need clarification, along with some other of Nick Newport's tips](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKquVghfwG0)


**Edit:** You can use alarms like I said above but that is not how I do it. I use an mp3 of silence and an mp3 of an alarm. I make a playlist of the silences and beeps and play that While I sleep. You should be able to find some time/alarm apps, I don't know what ones are available.

**Edit:** People are complaining about the title claiming I shouldn't guarantee anything. EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT and LUCID DREAMING TAKES TIME! Be sure to try every method multiple times with a couple days in between each time. Always have faith in your methods you're using and be positive. Don't doubt yourself or methods. Like any other skill lucid dreaming takes practice. Happy Lucids!

1360773672.0,148,self.LucidDreaming,18ga90,Three easy tips for any beginner/learner - also advice,VaesLondon,187,39,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/18ga90/three_easy_tips_for_any_beginnerlearner_also/,"Step one: Keep a dream journal so over time you develop a natural ability to remember your dreams (you could have had hundreds of lucid dreams; you just won't have remembered any). You could do this in a journal, notepad, word processor, really anything that can hold text. It is best to document a dream within minutes of waking up, because it is easy to forget something vague if your brain is concentrating on what you're going to eat for breakfast.

Step two: Set up a reality check. A reality check is literally making sure if you are in reality or the dream world. This must become a habit if you are to easily tell if you're dreaming or not. A really simple one that usually works for me is looking at your hands as if examining them after a manicure. In the dream world, you fingers can rarely keep their normal shape due to the high processing of thoughts going on, the brain can't focus on that one thing. Some more suggestions for RCs are: poking a finger through your palm, walking through mirrors (don't try this in your actual home to save embarrassment!), attempting to fly etc.

The movie Inception is not a good base for RCs, because in your dreams you will not always have a specific item, so generally try to work with what you know you will have.

Step three: Once dream remembrance and RCs (reality checks) have become a natural ability, all you have to do is sleep, and be patient. It will come to you.

P.S I posted this a few months ago, but recent posts have shown that it might be beneficial for some for me to post again.

*Edit*

Oakleafer made a deeper analysis of this technique in the comments section, here it is for more convenience:


""Dream journals require continual commitment and perseverance. After the honeymoon period has worn off very few people stick to keeping their journal regularly updated, night after night, dream after dream - Be prepared and understand that it's a big undertaking. if you're not diligent and you'll soon find that days weeks or even months have gone by when you realise you haven't written in your journal.

Reality Checks require a great deal of mental discipline. Simply going through the motions of an RC then continuing with whatever you are doing is going to be useless. You need to really question your state - really bring your awareness into the present moment. Stop what you're doing, ask yourself 'Is this a dream?' - absorb and look for inconsistencies in your environment - ""How did I get here?"" ""Is everything behaving as it should?"" ""What was I doing 15 minutes ago?"" Look for signs that you are in a dream. then perform your reality check. 
This can be a very hard habit to form and it is easy to become flippant and perform the practice half-heartedly.
Induction is a delicate process that requires several independent factors to align, even then your preparations have only increased your chances of lucid dreaming, not guaranteed success.
Above all. None of this is natural. We naturally erase our dream memories, if you're not careful you will slip back into this natural state. You need to constantly keep up with the practices, don't rest on your laurels.""",,False,,t5_2r0f4,1360788331.0,,,True,t3_18ga90,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/18ga90/three_easy_tips_for_any_beginnerlearner_also/,

I think I have the solution. 

**The dream journal.** 

If you have been trying for a while with no lucidity, let me say that I, as well as many others, was like you once. It took me one whole year of attempting to lucid dream to actually have a lucid dream. I say that not to get you down but rather so you can learn from my foolish mistakes and my personal successes. I currently average 3 dreams a night but often more with it peaking at maybe ten. I have lucid dream frequently with the most in one night peaking at seven. It was quite the opposite not too long ago. Far from it. Read on!

Edit- for perspective purposes, this was like 3-4 years ago.

I tried everything. Reality checks, waking up often during the night, WILD, vitamin B6, a plethora of other supplements, binaural beats, isochronic tones, sigiling, mantras, meditation, saturating myself with lucid dreaming knowledge while awake, you name it. No success what so ever. I also only remembered about a dream once every couple of weeks too, so I figured that dream recall would be a good avenue of attack. 

I had heard of the importance of journaling before and I had even tried it, but I wouldn't remember dreams often enough to make it useful, or so I thought. The fact is I was, and am, a lazy prick. I would often wait until going to bed to record the previous nights dreams. Even when I was not lazy, I just could not seem to remember dreams well enough to make the journal worthwhile.

One day I got fed up with having no success and I decided to do something about it. I got a spiral notebook and a pen and put them near my bed and pledged to put them in use when I awoke. I had the same problems as before. I would remember a dream every couple of weeks. This was getting me pissed of like nuts. 

What I decided to do was make a mantra that I would say and use actual effort, even on mornings where I would wake up with absolutely no dream memories to latch on to. I would say this in my head every morning right after waking up and while taking a shower, eating breakfast, brushing my teeth and anything else. 

The mantra was ""remember your dreams."" Plain and simple. The result of my toil was this. I would awake and after saying the mantra for as long as it took for my train of thought to carry me away, I would begin to think of problems I was having in life or of the previous days activities. Then BOOM! I would get a flashback to something that happened in a dream I had and all the memories would flush back as if I had just experienced them. I would often remember one or even two more dreams after the first. Sometimes I would remember them without even thinking back to the former day or even thinking at all! Plenty of material to write down in the journal.

I would be able to do this maybe once every three days when I first started it. After about a month I was averaging three dreams every night or so. Soon after I had my first lucid dream and I was ecstatic. I didn't even do anything cool but it was incredible. 

The point of all this is that you would do well to keep a dream journal, no matter what your reservations are. If you can't remember a dream to write down, just remember this; The average human has about five or so dreams a night. If you put in a serious effort to remember dreams even when you have no recollection of anything post falling asleep, you will. It seems impossible when you are actually laying there with an empty mind and a pen and paper in your hands and I knew that feeling once. 

But what can I do with a dream journal to become lucid?

Good question. A bunch of things. After you have like twenty or however many dream written, take the time to read through them and establish linkages and concurrent themes. Look for places in which your mind deceived you into thinking an environment or situation was reality. Look to see what people are common characters or what situations your dream-self finds itself in. Do reality check and make it apparent to yourself that it may be a dream whenever these things happen in reality or in a dream. 

You will get it.

**TL;DR-** If you were that lazy that you need a tl;dr to sum this up for you then you are way too lazy for this to help you. Go do WILD a few hundred times. Sorry.

I realize that all projections of people, events, motivations, etc within my dream are characterizations of the dynamic interplay between the subconcious and the conscious. The people I interact with in my dreams are utterly amazing manifestations of my psyche. I once met a heartless, cold-blooded killer with whom I threatened to kill. At my final threat of killing him, I felt utterly strange, as if a feeling of impending doom was upon me. As if by threatening him, I was really threatening myself. The truth is, I was threatening myself. That heartless murderer was as much me as I was the person threatening him. By threatening to kill him, I was at the same time threatening to kill my own subconscious as my conscious self, inviting my subconscious to kill my conscious self as the killer.

As we dream, our bodies constantly remind us that we are one unified entity. When we become disconnected with ourselves, we tend towards what are nightmares, since we cannot reconcile the manifestations we dream with our precieved notions of ourselves.

Ultimately our dreams are us, and they remind us that we are one. There is no distinction between the subconscious and the conscious. There is no distinction between who you are and who you wish yourself to be. You are you. I am me. There is no disharmony between the two.

In waking life, we learn that even you are not you and I am not me. We learn that ourselves are mere illusions-- that is, consciousness is not an individualized act-- but an expression of one consciousness in varied paths. There is one ocean of consciousness and it flows and expresses itself differently through each of our biological units.

If you were to move past my seemingly metaphysical claims, you must know that we all come from stardust. Ultimately the universe is in us, as we are within the universe. In a way, we are the way in which the universe is experiencing itself.

Thus you are the universe, as I am the universe. Our selves are indistinct from other individual biological units, just as the manifestations in our dreams are indistinct from our individual selves. Our individual selves in waking life are just manifestations of a conscious/subconscious universe.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_vsfgn,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/vsfgn/what_dreaming_has_lead_me_to_realize/,

The purpose of this project is to get a little more understanding of how effective the FILD method is. Participants will be asked to attempt FILD for ten nights and report their success rate. 

**Participants**

Anyone who is attempting FILD is welcome to join. 

**Definition of Lucid Dream**

A dream in which you are aware that you are in a dream.  (Hypnogogia, flashes of images or sounds originating from the mind which occur during the onset of sleep, are not considered dreams.) 

**Definition of FILD**

Let's define FILD as waking up from sleep, then doing light repetitive movements with the fingers and allowing the body to drift off to sleep while the mind stays quiet, but conscious, until a dream is perceived, the process lasting usually between several seconds and a few minutes. (For now, let's not include attempts that are made when you first lay down to sleep or during naps after you have gotten up in the morning.)

**Definition of Success**

Entering a dream and being consciously aware that you are in a dream while attempting FILD will be considered success. (It is not necessary to be able to control anything in the dream or even move you dream body.) 

**Reports**

Submit your reports as a post below. Copy the format below and fill it in as you collect your data. Only reports with information on ten complete days will be included when we crunch the results.

Since most people here have probably just started trying FILD (and so your experiences are fresh in your mind), go ahead and include your experience over the last week or so. (Please don't include your experiences for attempts that were made longer than a few weeks ago.) Ignore nights that you didn't attempt FILD, or nights that you wanted to try, but didn't wake up and get a chance. 

**Wrap up**

I don't know when we should stop collecting reports, but when it looks like we have enough, I'll put up a note that people should stop making new reports. At that time I'll be sure to give people who are already started plenty of time to finish up.

**Very Preliminary Results**

With just a few people contributing so far, here are some trends. These are early and will be distorted, but it's fun to see where it is going. 

**Success by Individual** -- This shows how many individuals have tried and succeeded and how many have tried and have not succeeded. 

Success: 4

No Success: 4

**Success by Nights Attempted** -- This shows how many total nights FILD has been attempted successfully and unsuccessfully by participants. 

Success: 9

No Success: 12

**Nights Before First Success**

Night 1: 4

Night 2: 

Night 3:

Night 4:

Night 5:

Night 6:

Night 7:

Night 8:

Night 9:

Night 10:

**Edit:** I did another count of the data that is coming in, but I left it in my car and I'm not getting dressed and going down to the car again tonight, but I'll summarize what the data is suggesting so far. A bit under half of the people who try FILD are successful. That is HUGE. **I have no idea what the success rate is with all other methods, but I can safely say that nothing else even comes close.** What is really weird is that most of them are successful on their first night of trying. Out of nine people I counted who were successful, eight of them were successful on their first night. The other guy was successful on his third. This is distorted for several reasons because the data is not all in, but it is still extreme. Anyway, please continue to add your data.

I've spent over 15 years trying to learn how to Lucid Dream. Eventually I was able to do it. Now, every time I lay down for a nap I have a lucid dream, and often leave my body. I'll spare those details. I just wanted to share a lucid dream I had recently.

A couple weeks ago I laid down to take a nap. I woke up (false awakening), got out of bed, and walked into the kitchen of my apartment. My Mom was in there, and she was cooking some food for me. We had a conversation, and then I noticed my apartment was larger than it is in reality. I eventually tell my Mom, ""I know this is going to sound insane, but... I think I'm dreaming."" My Mom responds, saying that's just ridiculous, and of course I'm not asleep. I begin to pace the apartment and observe my surroundings again. My apartment is far too big, and my Mom is using pots and pans I know for a fact neither of us have. I confront her and say, ""Look Mom, my apartment is not this big, and we both know neither of us have the pots and pans you're using."" She puts a pan down slowly, back onto the stove, and looks up at me, right in the eyes. She has no expression whatsoever, like she's looking right through me. And everything begins to slowly fade and fizzle away.

At this point, I'm back in bed, trying to wake up. This happens every time. Fasle awakenings... on average I have about 10 before I can actually wake up.

I have a ton of other stories I can share, but figured I'd share this most recent one. If anyone enjoyed this, I am more than happy to share some of the more intense and fantastic experiences I've had. Leaving my body has also become quite common, but I know this subreddit doesn't like to discuss that sort of thing. I know it's real, because there's no other explanation for the experiences, but it's impossible to convince anyone of it's authenticity unless they've experienced it themselves. It's for this reason I rarely discuss these things with anyone, because it can be very difficult to believe. I know it's happening to me, but I can understand people having a hard time believing. Today, I'm comfortable enough to finally come out and participate in this subreddit.

I also know quite a bit about what techniques can be used to learn how to LD and go out of body. I can at least share what's helped me get to where I am today, if anyone is interested.

**EDIT**: The downvotes have spoken, and I truly regret breaching the OBE topic here. It will never happen again. If I feel like sharing LD experiences again some day, perhaps I will. I guess it's time to go frolic with the silly unscientific New Age people in the OBE subreddit. I knew there was a reason I subscribed to this one and not that one.

I was having a pretty normal dream at first, it involved me and a few people hanging out at some plaza or something by a fountain doing god knows what I don't know. The entire time I was on my phone, checking a social media network that didn't exist. It was similar to Vine, except it involved a lot of tagging/hashtags. 

I kept getting texts from someone asking me to stop ""tagging"" them or whatever, but I noticed how detailed everything looked while I was doing it. Like hell, my dreams were never this detailed. My phone OS had everything perfectly correct, and in my dream mind I thought ""wow, that looks just about right"". It's almost if i made the connection that I was dreaming but did nothing about it. 

I get another text from this person to try out and app called Furon, (doesnt exist, had to look it up) where you have your entire media social network like Instagram, Vine, Twitter pics, Facebook pics, YouTube, And Vimeo streamed all into one timeline. (This is was a fucking amazing thing to think up out of the blue, I was so surprised to find out it didn't exist. Somebody make that shit.)

Then I realized somehow, while I'm still poking around on my phone, I had ended up back in my house or something, and a TV was on in the room behind me with the door closed. It seemed to be Judge Judy or something, because the narrator sounded familiar and was saying things I could make out perfectly. Again, this is really detailed shit for me to dream. I started thinking about how freaked out i'd be to wake up not knowing what that noise was, and at that moment it's like my whole brain melted. I was *instantly* awake and conscious in my bed and I got the most intense sensation of my whole brain like buzzing, warm and tingly. Nothing seemed real for a good 5 seconds. I've had this sensation minorly on weed before, but nothing like this. Ever. **NOTE: THIS WAS NOT SLEEP PARALYSIS OR IN ANY WAY FELT LIKE IT** After getting my shit together, I was still a bit lost trying to figure out what happened. I had to look up that social network app because I swear to god that had to have existed, it seems like such a good idea. But nope. 

It may not sound as intense as it seems, but it's 2 am and it's enough for me to find this subreddit and write about. It was probably one of the most odd things to happen to me in my life. Just wanted to see what you guys thought. Thanks!

TL;DR Physically felt my brain allegedly overheat and tingle from too much thought processing. 

**EDIT: To clarify a few things: Yes i've lucid dreamed before, and i know what sleep paralysis is and have experienced that as well. Can't say this was really either. Just a very odd sensation, but it was an experience.**

Here's the drawing: http://i.imgur.com/241R9.jpg

Look below for description.

I was looking over Fiverr to get some homework help for my business course in college when I came across this '[I draw your dream for $5](http://fiverr.com/stuffonmyhead/draw-your-dream)' thing.

I don' dream all that often but there was one particular dream I had when I was 6-7 that I still remember. I thought I'll ask her to draw it.

Here's the description of the dream I gave her,

&gt;Imagine a wide landscape, it's night the sky is dark with some stars and a shining moon. There is nothing around, just a faceless man in front of me. And perhaps a small, creepy, old wooden house very far away and unclear.
&gt;
&gt;The ground is covered with bright green grass as far as the eyes can see and nothing else.
&gt;
&gt;The man is a human, but a little ghost-like, thin and relaxed. He is carrying a black balloon in his left hand, the balloon has a long and thin rope attached to it.
&gt;
&gt;He has extended his hand as a gesture of offer, to let the kid grab it.
&gt;
&gt;In the dream I took the balloon from him, and it took me away from the ground, like he tricked me into grabbing the balloon. Before I could let go I was already too high up. It was the weirdest dream I've ever had and thought it was quite magical and philosophical at that age. So far I've interpreted it as ""I'm basically screwed"".

I don't remember what happened either I disappeared in the sky or I let go of the balloon even though I was too far high up and woke up with that falling sensation.

I thought I'll share it with you, so you can also get your dreams drawn.

What do you think of the whole thing? Is the dream as strange to you as it is to me? I can't think of anything in the real world that would've caused me to dream such random thing.

Continuing to sleep when I'm not tired anymore is always the easiest way for me to have a lucid dream.  


So I awaken to a bedroom full of vibrant colors and I get up only to see my body still laying in bed.  ""Oh hell yes, I'm lucid"", I think to myself.  


I immediately head over to my neighbors house to sleep with his wife.  Outside the air is brisk and everything is super vibrant and beautiful.  I enter the house and she is in the kitchen.  I grab her and we start making out.  I notice we are in perfect sync, no one has ever kissed me so perfectly and with such lust.  I set her up on the kitchen table and we get undressed and start going to town.  A few moments later her husband walks in through the front door and he is PISSED.  His look of shock and disappointment was so realistic and his words had such conviction and his performance was just so believable.  At that moment, I questioned whether I was really dreaming or not.  I went to flip the light switch, and it worked... lights out... lights on... oh SHIT.  This has never happened for me before, I could never control the lights in my dreams.  My heart rate doubles and I begin to panic.  I look at the time on the microwave and I notice it's not even displaying a time, but just a 4 digit number.  I look away and I look back and the number has significantly changed.  I sigh a huge breath of relief and go back to what I was doing.  Her husband just kind of wandered around the room with an astonished look on his face and kept asking what the hell I was doing.


TL;DR I didn't take the time to do a proper reality check and thought I may have actually banged my neighbors wife.

1331858088.0,143,self.LucidDreaming,qyn06,I am a very experienced life-long lucid dreamer and thought I'd offer some advice if any of you have any questions. ,DiscoRace,165,22,183,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/qyn06/i_am_a_very_experienced_lifelong_lucid_dreamer/,"Hey everyone, 

I just found this subreddit today. I am a very experienced lucid dreamer and thought I'd offer some advice if any of you have any questions. A little background, I've been lucid dreaming all my life but didn't realize what I was doing until about 5 years ago (so there's a name for it!) and also realized I could control my own dreams, which is very difficult at first, but is very, very fun as you can imagine. 

I have always had sleep problems, insomnia and I am a very light sleeper, I'm sure this has something to do with my ability to lucid dream so often. I suggest trying to lucid dream when you are not overly exhausted, when you have to think about falling asleep before you actually do. Instead of worrying or planning your day tomorrow, imagine a far away world, and build it around yourself in your head, if that makes sense. Try to think nonsensically, make up strings of words that don't fit each other until you are asleep. 

Also there are some herbal tricks (talk to a doctor first if you have medical issues or are on medications!!!) But, check out Skullcap and Valerian tinctures (they are separate herbs). Those worked the best for me (I took them for insomnia (they work)) to create vivid and lucid dreams. 

I can fly and know I'm flying and even ""remember how to fly"" if need be and I always fly the same way, it's kind of like swimming and gliding at the same time. I can transform atmospheres and people. I know this is an IAMA but I'd rather address it to people who are genuinely interested in the subject, I hope that's ok. 

tl;dr: I'm a life-time lucid dreamer, ask me anything you want. 

EDIT: I'm going to go AFK for a little bit, and maybe go to sleep (see you there?). If I don't come back tonight, I'll def try to answer everyone's Q tomorrow. They are all awesome. 

EDIT 2: Whoa, ok I'm back. I'll try to get to everyone. I see some repeats. I'll try to make a little list of things to do to try to reach lucidity soon. 

EDIT 3: Thanks so much, this was super fun. I hope I helped people. I would suggest trying when you are calm, please notice that most of the time frames I reference are in years, not days or weeks, it takes a long time. If you want a certain dream to happen, think about it constantly and revisit your dreams while you are a awake and talk about them if you can. 

Also, certain herbs and drugs can increase or decrease your chances of vivid and lucid dreams. Stuff like Skullcap, Valerian as well as natural factors like stress and melatonin levels (again, if you are female especially, be careful of it and ask a doctor or at least read up about it.) 

If you do become lucid, try not to get excited, remain calm and walk around your surroundings. Try to do things in the dream that you do while you are awake, very natural things, but at least be concious in the dream you are making yourself do them and in turn affecting the surroundings the same way they would be affected if you did what are you are doing in real life.

I figured I would get up earlier than usual to do it. I usually wake up at about 7-7:20. I set my alarm to 5 am. At 5 am that following morning, I made myself breakfast, showered, and then went to go do my homework. Right before I was about to start, I realized that it wasn't due that day. So the procrastinator in me took over, and I went back to sleep. That morning, I had 3 straight dreams, 2 of which were lucid. And I remembered them like it happened 5 minutes ago. Everyday since then, I've woke up at 5, ate breakfast, showered, and went back to bed again (usually in my towel), and I would always wake up from my lucid slumber, and do a check to remember what exactly happened in my lucid dream. This has been going on for about 4 months. It makes me much more of a morning person, it puts me in a better mood, I feel more awake, and that leads to better performance in school. This trick has never failed me, and I wanted to see if other redditors do something similar, or perhaps they could try it out themselves. And I would also recommend practicing techniques that will help you lucid dream more often, such as reality checks, and keeping a log of all the dreams you've had, because I was training myself to lucid dream when I discovered this trick. Here's a website that can give more background into helping you lucid dream.

* What is lucid dreaming?

A lucid dream is any dream you realize is a dream. This may  or may not come with the ability to control your dream.

* How can I lucid dream?

Lucid dreaming can be obtained by many different methods, the most common of which will be detailed in this guide. 

* How long will it take?

Lucid dreams can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. It most commonly takes around a week. 

**Common Methods of Lucid Dreaming** 


*Tip: Keep a dream journal, there's a link between recording dreams and having an early first lucid dream.*

*[ WILD \(Wake Induced Lucid Dream\):](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/trz9z/beginners_wild_method_adjustments_tricks_and_tips/) 

Difficulty Level : Medium to High

In order to WILD, you must set an alarm 5-6 hours after you fall asleep. When you awaken, it's best just to use the bathroom, to relax yourself. It's best to do this in full darkness. When you return to bed, completely relax yourself, while not falling asleep. After a bit, you will hopefully start seeing images, lights, hearing sounds, of feeling strange vibrations. This is known as Hypnagogia, do not panic. Eventually, you will end up in a vivid dream.

* MILD (Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dream)

Difficulty: Easy 

As you fall asleep, imagine a previous dream, or create one. Continually   think of your dream as you fall asleep. As you imagine your dream, think of a phrase to repeat in your head until you fall asleep, such as ""I will become lucid tonight.""

* Reality Checks 

Difficulty: Easy

A reality check checks for reality, and if done within a lucid dream, results in lucidity. Most people do around 30 reality checks per day, and these reality checks can include anything from checking how many fingers you have, jumping to test gravity, etc.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

* Was this a lucid dream? 

If you realized it was a lucid dream before you awaken, it is a lucid dream. 

* How can I control my lucid dreams?

The most common method to control your dreams, is to fall asleep via WILD. 

* Everything is fuzzy, and short lasting within my lucid dream.

In order to have a true lucid dream, you must stabilize your dream. The most common method is to spin around, while rubbing your hands together. This will fully immerse yourself in the dream.

* Is there anything I can do to increase my chances of lucid dreaming?

Scientifically documented, there are [many ways](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/y7tn8/scientifically_cited_ways_to_increase_dream/) to increase your chance of lucid dreaming, such as Vitamin B6 and exercise. While not scientifically documented, many people find that consuming cheddar cheese, and drinking apple juice help to increase your dream recall.

*Tip: Be as vivid, and descriptive in your dream journals.*

**A Short List of Reality Checks**

* Check your fingers, if you have more or less than five, its a dream.
* Close one eye, and look at your nose. If you see it, it is not a dream.
* Attempt to push your index finger through your hand, it will go through in a dream.
* Use a light switch, they rarely work in dreams.
* Look at text or numbers, they will appear fuzzy, strange, and may change in dreams.  
* Plug your nose and attempt to breathe, you will breathe in your dreams.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,1345591409.0,,,True,t3_ykvxb,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/ykvxb/a_definitive_guide_to_lucid_dreaming_and_faq/,

I don't want to unsubscribe, I really don't, but at least half of what I see here is just the same noob questions again and again (seriously, I find myself giving more downvotes than upvotes here, despite being the kind of person who tends to upvote generously and downvote sparingly). I'd appreciate it if you guys could just take the time to read this (upvotes would be nice, too - purely for visibility, as I don't get karma for self posts).

First of all, if you haven't already, READ THE SIDEBAR. I cannot possibly stress this enough. The sidebar exists for a reason. It should be the first thing you read on ANY subreddit, especially if you're going to post something.

Now, I'll address a few things that I see far too often here.

**How do I LD?**

What did I just say? READ THE SIDEBAR.

**What is / How do I [insert commonly-known acronym/term/technique/etc. here]?**

Again, PLEASE, read the sidebar. If that doesn't answer your question, use the search function.

**""This has probably been asked before, but...""**

STOP. If you think your question has been asked before, IT ALMOST DEFINITELY HAS. You'll almost certainly find your answer by checking the sidebar, the ""new"" tab, and/or the search function.

**Was this a lucid dream? / I had a dream about lucid dreaming.**

Were you aware you were dreaming? If so, that was a lucid dream. If not, it wasn't. ANY dream in which you are aware you are in a dream, REGARDLESS of whether or not you have control over the dream or even yourself, is STILL a lucid dream.

**I'm scared of going into sleep paralysis; is LDing worth it?**

Seriously, do you guys NOT read the sidebar? There are many other methods of inducing lucid dreams, and only WILD involves conscious SP.

**[Insert question/statement about a ""dream within a dream"" here]**

(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

I'm sorry, but every single time somebody says they've had a ""dream within a dream"", I just want to throw my computer out the window. I see it mentioned so often that I actually really don't want to watch Inception, as I'm pretty sure that's what started that myth.

Anyway, you had a ""dream within a dream"", you say? No, you didn't. Did you ""wake up"" in the dream? That was a false awakening. A false awakening is simply when a dream suddenly switches to a new scene, which begins with ""waking up"", creating the illusion of having had a ""dream in a dream"". Did you ""fall asleep"" in a dream? Again, that creates the illusion of a ""dream within a dream"", although, once again, it's just a transition between dream scenes, triggered by ""falling asleep"" this time.

While many of us here do know a lot about dreaming in general, this subreddit is strictly about lucid dreaming. Try asking over at /r/dreams instead.

**I'd like to share this lucid dream I had.**

If this is your first LD or one that seems particularly important, by all means, feel free to share. However, we'd rather you not go posting every single LD you have. Sure, it's allowed, but the main focus of this subreddit is questions and discussion; too many stories just clutters it up. Like I said, if you want to share it because it's your first LD or any LD that seems particularly important, go right ahead. If you just want to post it for the sake of sharing your lucid dreams, though, I'd recommend going to /r/luciddreamingstories instead. It just helps keep this subreddit a bit cleaner that way.

**I have a question/idea, which I could not find on the sidebar nor with the search function. / I had a weird/interesting/funny experience related to lucid dreaming.**

Yes! That's exactly the kind of content this subreddit needs! That's what we all want to see! Please, go right ahead and post it!

We raised $15,000 on [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/finite-films/anamnesis-a-sci-fi-web-series-about-lucid-dreaming) to help fund the project which is based on [a short film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6ZpTI-3-dE) we made a year go.  The story centers around a group of people that start to be affected by their dreams in strange, almost supernatural ways, and one of the protagonists is a practiced lucid dreamer who is always questioning his reality.

If you're interested at all, you can check out this [brief teaser-trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcEUMhKdJRg) we released a couple weeks ago.

We wrote the episodes after doing a lot of research on lucid dreaming, and also consulted with a lucid dreaming expert, [Daniel Love](http://www.exploringluciddreams.com), who recently released a book about how to lucid dream.

We had never experienced a lucid dream before we began working on this show, but during the production many of our actors and crew have started to have various kinds of lucid dreams.  Our actor Zach Brown, who plays [""Sean""](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=513798051999737&amp;set=a.513797411999801.1073741825.165349070177972&amp;type=3&amp;theater) the lucid dreamer, practices every night and has gotten really good at wake-induced lucidity, while others of us have managed to do some reality checks in our dreams to realize we were asleep.  It's been really fun!

Today we released [a short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umZ3x0jU0cE) that shows all the behind-the-scenes of filming the web series.  We anticipate it will be about an hour long, spread across four episodes.  Our goal is to make a cinematic, exciting show that is a lot bigger than what you'd usually expect from a web series.

Anyway, last night I finally got lucidity where I realized I was lucid and tried to do things.

Before lucidity, I was having a dream where I could somehow close my eyes and transport myself around the world. I was in California and was having trouble getting back home because there were too many people around. 

It got weird when Steven Seagal showed up and told me he could do the same thing. So we decide to leave this crowded area and go somewhere else and I still have trouble getting back home. So I say to him, this must be a dream since none of this is really working.

He tried to convince me not to try and check if it was a dream.

So here's the reality check - dice! For some reason I figured that if I rolled dice in a dream that they would be fucked up, and oh boy were they. I started out by rolling the exact numbers that I wanted to, say, 30 with a 30 sided die. After that I began rolling numbers that didn't exist on the die. 55, 66, 77 on a 20-sided die. Then the 20-sided dice had like, numbers stamped all over it, like a misprinted die, and was very detailed. Also, a 6-sided die that had 4 numbers in different directions on one face. It was pretty awesome to realize I was dreaming and still be testing it out.

So I exclaim, ""hahaha! I AM dreaming! Look at these fucked up dice!"" and Steven Seagal said ""god dammit, I'm not real.""

At this point I wanted to try some stuff, and there was some person in the room that I didn't like. Steven Seagal had now changed into one of my real life friends instead. 

I pointed at the person I didn't like and asked my friend ""I don't want this asshole here, how do I get rid of him?"" to which my friend responded happily - ""just blink!""

So I started blinking and watching this guy change into different people. I was getting very excited that this was happening, and I found myself realizing I was laying in bed. :(

I was still happy nevertheless, got up and told my partner all about it and then went back to bed to try again! Thanks for reading!

I was in some plains surrounded by mountains, and I don't remember how, but I realised I was in the dream.
I felt like I could feel myself laying in bed and occasionally twitching and moving in bed.
I had these weird feelings during the dream where I thought I may have started to feel myself
waking up because there was this weird feeling in my back and side of my body.
Well I did what I practiced and rubbed my hands together, spun in circles, and kept doing reality checks.
I did a reality check by pushing my finger through my hand a few times, and it went through my hand!
Well this dream felt so real, like real life. Even touching things felt real.
So obviously the first thing I did was grab the closest random girl and start having sex with her.
Then I grabbed two more and had a 4-way.
So after that was all done, I started flying. Normally in dreams where I don't know it's a dream, I have so much trouble flying.
This was the easiest flying I've ever done. I didn't have to squeeze my arms by my side or anything.
I was flying around head-first, then I laid down in the air, then I flew over some water and grazed my hands through it
(I also did this as an alternative to rubbing my hands together)
So I started flying up the mountains, but I decided I wanted to go faster, so I basically teleported small distances at a time.
Every time I intentionally blinked, I would open my eyes to see I was 100 yards or so further.
I remember The ""graphics"" in my dream looked amazing, and just so realistic.
Even after teleporting, everything looked the same, except I was a little further.
Then I tried to manipulate things just by thinking about them.
It didn't work at first, but then I could make things appear just by thinking about it.

I would probably remember more if it was the last dream I had, but I had another dream after it that wasn't lucid.

An interesting part of this experience was that I either imagined it, or kept feeling like I was going to wake up because
I kept feeling some kind of feeling in my back and side of my body and the dream would fade and I sort of felt like I wasn't dreaming, but could feel my body laying in bed.
A few seconds later, I was back in the dream, still aware of my body. (Isn't that sort of like the WILD technique?)
So I felt myself being completetly still in bed, but moving around in my dream.
Also, the dream felt like it lasted so long. I even remember thinking that to myself, then wondering how long I might have been asleep, and then I even remembered that you can only dream until the end of your REM sleep cycle, so I stopped worrying about it.

I'm so glad I accomplished this and can't wait to do it again!

However, one way I've realized I was in a dream and then had control over that dream multiple times was because I felt no strength behind my punches.

This is because your body is asleep during your dream, and therefore your arm muscles and you can't really feel the impact during a dream on your fist or feel your arm move.  As I guy who punches a lot in real life and in dreams, once I understood why my punches had no impact I started instantly realizing it was a dream when I noticed it. I'd be fighting ninjas or something and try to hit them, and my arm wouldn't work, then my brain would go ""OH DUMMY YOUR ARM IS ASLEEP"" and then I'd realize I was in the dream, and therefore be able to control my dream.

I haven't read very much about other techniques, just WILD and MILD, so maybe this is nothing new, but it's worked for me for a long time.  I've never experienced ""sleep paralysis"" with it.

It's *very* simple, but requires a bit of mental self-discipline.  As you drift slowly into sleep, you will hit a point where your imagination wanders severely.  Recognizing this point is really the one and only step.

When you lay down to sleep, picture in your head the setting you want your dream to be in.  Let's say you want your dream to be on a beach.  Your imagination might go something like this:

*Okay, I'm on the beach.*

*Warm sun.*

*Rough sand.*

*Soft waves.*

*A salty breeze.*  

*Mmm... relaxing....*

...

...

...

*How do I fly this airplane?*

...

...

...

*Did we need ketchup?*

...

...

...

*That's a huge bear!*

...

...

...

*Wait... something's not right... I'm not on the beach anymore.*

When you realize that your mind has taken you away from the place you were imagining, *force* your imagination back to the beach.  It will wander again, but each time it will be easier to detect.  Just keep forcing it back to the beach until eventually you are there.  The experience will move *noticeably* from your mind's eye to your physical eye (or so it seems).  You will know that you're in the dream without needing to look at your hands or anything.

Just be sure to keep thinking to yourself, ""Am I still on the beach?  What about now?  What about now?""  If you let your mind wander, eventually it will set itself down on one of those random thoughts, and you will start dreaming without realizing it.  Detecting the first moment of wandering is the hardest part.

Anyway, it just seemed simpler than all these other techniques I've been reading about.  I hope it works for those of you who have had trouble with other strategies.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_r67y2,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/r67y2/simple_technique_ive_used_for_years_high_success/,

Upon awakening, I threw up three times and have felt completely broken since. This is the dream as best as I can remember it.

I was in Wilmington, North Carolina visiting family. It was about 5am dreamtime and I had decided to take a walk along the beach. Looking up, the sky was a few shades closer to red than normal. As I gazed into the atmosphere, someone placed their hand on my shoulder and spoke softly ""Beautiful, isn't it? It has been getting redder every morning for the last week."" I turned around and standing behind me was the girl I am beginning to fall in love with in real life. For story purposes, we'll call her Madeline... except in the dream, it felt like I was meeting her again for the first time.

A brief period passed where I'm not sure exactly what happened, but we ended up in a mansion in Myrtle Beach, SC, about 60 miles away. It turns out, Madeline's mother was running for mayor of the city. Anyway, after a night of strolling along the beach front, it was like falling in love with the same person all over again. I can still see a high-definition picture of what her face looked like when we stopped and started holding each other on the beach. The next morning, the sky was now a blood-orange color and I could see the look on Madeline's face turn to pure worry. She said ""we're not safe here,"" and took me into the cellar of her house with a trap door underneath that lead to a panic room. ""She can't hear us here,"" Madeline whimpered. I was then described exactly what was happening. Earth really was created by a single being, but when people started becoming more technologically and intellectually advanced, it made the primitive creator angry that we were creating our own virtual worlds instead of living in hers... so she turned evil and started planning a way to end her creation. Sadness gripped both of us as we held each other tight for what seemed like an hour. As we made our way back upstairs, the television was blaring alarms with a banner reading ""Warning: High-dose radiation is coming from the sky, stay inside and go underground if possible."" Instead of going back to the cellar, we went into a sort of bunker behind the house where we waited in horror with nothing but a radio with poor transmission due to the radiation. At the top of the bunker was a 5-foot diameter pane of triple-layer bulletproof glass used for looking outside. The sky had turned the color of human blood, and the air had become electrified with lightning striking all over the place.

All of a sudden, I heard this screeching voice clawing at my ears and filling every pore of my body. ""Your time has come, you'll die like the rest. Your love means nothing."" It was simple, but haunting. I was the only one who heard it, and I just fell down in disbelief as tears flowed down my face. Then, the pane of glass was ripped off of the bunker. What seemed like 200 degree air poured into the room. Frantic, I grabbed onto madeline's hand as tightly as possible, and we were going to try and make it to the secret cellar from earlier. The house was crumbling, and the earth was violently shaking. We knew we were dead, but we wanted to spend as long as possible together. I looked up in the sky, and I could see what looked like a giant orb pressing down toward the earth's surface. Another planet was getting to slam into us at full speed.

We ran inside the house, when suddenly I felt a tug on my hand as if Madeline had stopped running. When I looked back, the chandelier had fallen and completely impaled her. Her eyes were wide open with shock, and she started convulsing rapidly with blood pouring out of her mouth. I just fell onto my knees and started crying harder than I knew was possible. Crying hard enough that blood started seeping from my skin. She was still momentarily conscious, and I scrambled back onto my feet whispering ""I love you so much"" into her ears. Her hand slowly trembled up to my face and I gripped it tightly. She tried to make a sound, but blood just started spurting out even more. Knowing she only had moments left, and I only had minutes left at best, I bent over and kissed her lips one last time. Her eyes faded backwards, and her muscles went limp. Emotionally torn to shreds, I went back outside and shouted at the sky with unintelligible fury. I was not even making sense, nor were words coming out of my mouth. It was just a bloodcurdling scream that had no other purpose than to show that the last moments of my life, and humanity's existence, was filled with death. A huge fissure opened in the ground, and I fell straight in, free-falling for what seemed like a full minute before landing in molten lava. I can still feel my skin melting from those few moments where I was still alive in the magma. Everything went dark, and I woke up with tears in my eyes, a soaked pillow, and sweat everywhere.

I opened my eyes and could not move. I did not start where I wanted to be, I was just laying in my bed. I looked around the room with my eyes, but could not move any other part of my body. Then I saw a man peering at me from across the room. I was startled at first but then I focused myself into rising off the bed and leaving my sleeping body. I rose to the foot of my bed and looked ay my sleeping body in amazement. I then turned to the man watching me and asked what he was doing here. He said ""I am watching over"". I asked him what he was watching over, and he said me. At this point I was creeped out and I asked him why he was watching me, he said ""I am your guardian angel, do not be afraid"". I then became more calm because I knew he was friendly, I did not know him at all but I had a connection with him somehow. I asked him if he would like to leave with me, but he said ""No, I must stay here and watch over. You may go on your way alone"".

I left my house and began walking around my neighborhood. It was late at night and nobody was outside, I was bored so I decided I would try to fly. I climbed onto a car parked on the street, took a running jump off it, and soared into the air. I flew through the air like Iron Man, hands at my side pointing down, as if rockets were pushing out my feet. After about 5-10 minutes I began to drop altitude, I tried to stay up but I was heading towards the ground fast. I hit a house, went through the roof, and slammed into the floor. Immediately I woke up in my bed, not in the real world though, I was still in the dream. 

The man watching over me said to me, ""You should be more careful next time, that's enough for one night. See you next time"". He then snapped his fingers and I woke up. As I looked around the room I did not see him there, I was back in the real world. I was amazed with what I have just done, and typed it all out on my ipod right away.

**TL;DR** I met my guardian angel in my dream. I started to fly but after a while I crash landed and woke up in my bed, still in the dream world. The guardian told me ""Be more careful next time, that's enough for one night. See you next time"". I then woke up.

As you might now, you mostly dream while in REM-sleep. This means of course, that you also lucid dream while in REM-sleep. Now, most people sleep about 6 to 9 hours every night of which 1,5 to 2,5 hours of REM-sleep occurs.

The Übermann schedule is a sleep schedule in which you take naps of 30 minutes during the day and because you only sleep for about 3 hours in total, all of your sleep is REM-sleep. This means you have dreams for 3 hours a day. Unfortunately, the Übermann schedule is very unhandy schedule because you don't have time for naps during the day.

I am free of school for 6 weeks right now so I am free to experiment with sleep and lucid dreaming, and this is what I'm going to try. I am going to use a adjusted version of the Übermann schedule. Instead of taking naps during the day, I am going to take those naps during the night. At the same time normal people sleep, but with 1 hour stops between them. Eventually I will force my body to fall into REM-sleep as soon as I fall a sleep.

As you might understand, this can be used with WILD very good. Because you fall into REM-sleep (and thus sleep paralysis) very quickly. If this is going to work, I will have a 'rest period' of 6,5 hours and I will sleep for 2,5 hours.

1374838821.0,133,self.LucidDreaming,1j3aza,Dream characters reacting violently to the dreamworld?,Mohevian,165,32,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1j3aza/dream_characters_reacting_violently_to_the/,"The Fish Market

So there I am, haunting the fish market and industrial district of a futuristic Shanghai. It's mid-day, cloudy, drizzling and smoggy. The sky is painted steel-gray with under-shades of blue. All of the surfaces are coated in a glaze of dust and water. It's a miserable place. I'm a foreigner, with a very poor understanding of Cantonese – an assassin, seeking out a target, which I was only told would be found in the fish packing district. He is a turncoat, an undercover agent with valuable information about my government, which he was planning to sell to the Chinese.

The market was filled with natives, shepherding bicycles through the muddy streets, adorned in translucent polycarbonate raincoats. I stopped an older woman, and asked her in broken Cantonese for the location of the fish packing factory. She told me it was located directly near the Gold Dragon Inn. I thought it odd for a hotel to be located in an industrial area. She pointed it out, and the hotel was a towering, sixty-something-story, new-looking white and black skyscraper. It was extremely out of place.

So, I walked over to the hotel and was greeted by a doorman, who was wearing a dark red ensemble, pristine. It was like the environment was absent for the building. The floor was made of marble, which was partially covered by the mud of the street. It seemed quite odd.

As I stood gazing at him, and formulating a question to ask, he pointed calmly behind me with a peaceful smile and said: “Isn't that who you are looking for?” in perfect English.

I turned around to see a hefty Russian immigrant, with messy dark brown hair, in a denim jacket and white working pants hauling about eight boxes of frozen fish stacked on a dolly. I calmly follow him through the plastic separators into the loading area of the fish market, which is absolutely crammed full of people, gutting and working with fish. He places the dolly down and wipes his brow, and is surprised when he realizes that I'm right behind him.

“You there!” I shout at him. Pulling out the concealed Beretta from my chest holster, and point it right at his head. He immediately throws his hands up, and a look of panic comes across his face. “Don't shoot!” He shouts.

The other people in the factory stop what they are doing, and pay attention.

“I'm not the man you're looking for!” He says. I pulled out the photograph I had of my target, earlier on, and compared the two. “This is you, isn't it?” I turned the photo towards him.

“Listen man, listen. I have a wife and kids – okay, please think about my family, I had to come here, I had no other choice.” He reached for his wallet, and unfurled it. It was a trifold, decent camel colored leather. The bottom half, indeed had pictures of his family.

For some reason, observing this; an extreme pang of logic began to come over me. The location, the hotel, the lapse in time, I couldn't remember how I got to find myself here – the English speaking doorman.

I slowly lowered my pistol, and gazed a bit at the man's black work boots. “This is.. a dream. None of this is real.” I said.

He looked confused.

I turned around and walked back out through the plastic separators, and looked right up into the sky, in disbelief of how incredibly real it was. I threw my handgun down into the dirt, and it began to rain. The rain felt good.

I took deep breaths of the salty, fish-scented, cold air, and marveled at the fact that I wasn't really breathing any air.

The workman whom I was supposed to assassinate a second ago, comes out of the factory. “Hey, buddy are you alright? Did you lose your marbles?”

I looked back down and observed the market, watching the activity of hundreds of people.. talking, trading, laughing, living. I stood by the edge of the dock and leaned over the metal hand-guards, gazing at the ocean, observing the waves, and the water currents, the wind.

The duster coat I was adorned in previously changed, and I was now wearing glowing white robes which were absolutely out of place, and reminiscent of Christian saintly paintings.

It was pretty amazing.

The workman approached. “Listen, I know that you're a dream character, so whatever I tell you isn't going to matter. Right now, this world – everything in it, doesn't exist. You don't exist, I don't exist, we're just figments of imagination, images of a sleeping mind.” I told him.

“Bullshit.” He says.

“Look at me, a second ago, I was pointing a gun at you, and now I'm glowing like the Pope, don't you think that's a bit odd?” 

“That was a different person, we've already called the metro police. They're out looking for him.” He says.

“I don't know why you are even arguing with me – you're a piece of my own subconscious mind, the fact that we've having a conversation right now and I don't know what you are going to say next, is actually puzzling me. We're technically the same person, and yet I never anticipate what you're going to say.”

“You're insane.” He said.

“Alright, let's make a bet – or rather, I'll prove it to you. In lucid dreams such as this, the dreamer is ascended to a level a god. I can fly, warp, and the various laws of physics don't apply to me anymore. We'll take the elevator up a high floor of that hotel, and then I'll jump. Wouldn't you like to see a crazy person commit suicide?” I said.

“I don't like where this is going – listen, you need professional help, I'll come up with you and we'll wait for the police to arrive, and then we can talk some more.”

I walked past the red doorman, who nodded down to me, as if he had known I was dreaming all along, and went into the lobby. A security guard sat behind a high wooden, oval desk, looking quite bored. I told him: “Listen, I taking the elevator up. You aren't interfering.” His response was a yawn.

We took the elevator up, to about the fifteenth floor, a decent height, enough of a fall to kill anyone. The hallway was full of identical white doors, all numberless. I kicked down the closest one, and entered, walking over to the glass sliding doors of the balcony, and opening it. This particular room had the king bed layout, and the balcony therefore was a bit larger, enough to fit two people standing comfortably.

I stood out onto the railing, balancing myself by holding my arms outstretched, and turned towards the workman, whom was nameless.

“Alright now, I'm going to jump – and float down safely to the ground. Then I'll use my powers to enchant you, and you will be able to do the same. Ready?”

I turned around, and jumped off the balcony, and began to slowly drift down, exactly as I had said – “feather falling”. The workman had tried to grab my robes, but now simply watched in awe from the balcony, as well as various others below in the markets.

I patted down, and everything was fine. I shouted up at him: “Your turn! Now jump!”

He stood out onto the railing, an outline of a person so high up, and having no idea exactly how to “enchant” someone in a dream, I just did whatever felt natural, and pointed my outstretched palm at him. A beam of blue light emerged, and surrounded him, causing flakes of blue light to dance around him.

He jumped, and I watched with delight, which suddenly turned into horror. He fell, as any normal person would – like a rock. A few seconds later, he crashed into the mud right at my feet with the most horrifying sound that a person could make. He was quite visibly dead, blood was pouring out of his head, and the natives surrounded him.

The metro police arrived just on time as he had said, slim Chinese men with communist-styled brim blue hats, holding their batons, and screaming at me in Cantonese.

“Everyone, stand back!” I shouted. I lifted my hands, and they suddenly began to glow in a bright golden light, and I pressed them against the center of his back. I could hear all of the bones become mended, snapping back into place, all the damage of the fall had become undone, and the workman inhaled strongly with a start, heaving and coughing out blood which had filled his lungs.

“He's alive!” I declared. But, the crowd were not impressed. A look of horror filled their faces, and they stood frozen, the policemen especially. The workman slowly clambered to his feet, and continued to cough, holding his chest, and finally becoming upright.

Instead of thanking me, he shoved me hard, into the mud. “You! You motherfucker! What gives you the fucking right?” He screamed at me. The crowd observed, I stood up slowly. 

“I just saved your life – you jumped off the 15th story of a hotel and survived! What I was telling you was true! We are in a dream!” But before I could continue talking, he gave me a sharp right hook. For being a god in a dream, being punched in the face hurt A LOT.
“What gives you the right? To be a god in our world?” His voice narrowed out and became very hoarse, tears welling up in his eyes. His face betrayed his true emotions – I hadn't ever seen a person express something like this before.

“If you're a god here, and you can do the things you do – you need to get out now, or else we'll kill you. Go back to wherever the fuck you came from, leave us god damned people alone, let us live out our lives in peace!” His face was filled with so much pain, with only the eyes, he damned me.

I looked at the crowd, and their expressions too. They could not decide whether to side with me, or the workman. The rain continued to pour, even more fiercely.

The workman pulled out his wallet again, looking at the pictures of his family, sobbing immensely, and then held them up to me again, and pressed the wallet against my chest. He wanted to hit me again, but he relented.

“What gives you.. the right... Forty years, I've lived here for forty years, my childhood, everything.. everything I've done.. you come here and tell me that it's not real...” His voice was hoarse.

He looked up at me. “We're as real as you. We're as real as wherever you say you come from.” He took my hands, his were covered in mud, and his own blood, they were shaking. “Please, I beg of you, even as much as I despise you – don't forget us. Leave, but don't forget us. Keep us in your mind. Tell others or do whatever you need to do – but please, don't forget the fish market.

I looked around the circle, and people were crying. I could sense that all of them wanted me to leave.

“I don't understand – I thought you people would be happy having a personal deity, I could build or give you anything you wanted, turn this miserable place into a utopia – this is your world after all.”

The red doorman approached me from the ring of the crowd, with a timid smile and put his hand on my shoulder. “Why do you think they put Jesus on the cross? This is their world. It's time for you to go home.”",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_1j3aza,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1j3aza/dream_characters_reacting_violently_to_the/,

Now keep in mind I have been having at minimum 2 LD's a week so I really didn't need to worry if it worked or not, so I went to bed last night right at 11pm and I had a non-lucid dream and my alarm clock woke me up at 4:20am cuz I'm immature and my rem-phases are a bit strange, anyways I was pretty damn tired, so after sliding my phone to unlock, I immediately went back to getting relaxed... Took me about a minute, JUST 1 minute!! And I started doing the finger piano thing, I was a bit skeptic for 10 seconds but I kept going because why not, nothing to lose.. So there I am doing this for like 30 more seconds and then when I thought it was cool I used my other hand, plugged my nose and 

HOLY S*^% I could breath! This right now is a dream and it took so little effort!! Anyways, I go right into visualization (just a general layout of my room) I sit up and check it again and it's still a dream! I sit down and stabilize a bit more then I get down to business.. I spawn these badass golden plate armor boots and fly right through my fucking roof, right through that bitch! Then while I'm on my roof looking over my neighborhood I cover myself in the armour from head to toe and I decide the time is now!

(UPDATE),jesigigs,228,101,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1fx5w4/my_boyfriend_tried_to_lucid_dream_and_now_is_not/,"**Previous Thread:** http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1fsfd4/my_boyfriend_tried_to_lucid_dream_and_now_is_not/?sort=new

**Update #1 on 6/7/2013 @ 8:00am:** After reading a lot of the comments and researching a bit more, I truly believe that the episode my boyfriend had 9 years ago from trying marijuana for the first and only time (horrible reaction= never trying it again) is rather similar to what happened. He was unable to sleep for 3 days and started saying ""profound things."" I think the lack of sleep and inability to tell reality from dreams during lucid dreaming most likely triggered all the thoughts, memories and feelings that were connected to what happened 9 years ago and had been buried deep inside, laying dormant for something just like this. I think if he ever tries something like this again or attempts to ever use drugs, we will most likely find ourselves in the same situation. Moral of the story: make sure you keep in mind ALL of your past history, even what may seem like a one-time occurrence, before experimenting. 

His family and I were finally able to visit him last night at the clinic. I am happy to report he almost seems like his normal self albeit sad, wanting to come home, and wondering why this has all happened. I told him that that's why we were at the clinic; to understand, see why this happened, and to make sure to prevent it in the future. We are still waiting to speak to a doctor to get any further information besides the hypothetical theories that we have formed ourselves. I know he's going to be on medication for a bit and will DEFINITELY be talking to a psychiatrist for a while. I will do anything and everything in my power to help him along this road. I know it will be hard, but I'm just happy to see him smirking and making jokes again. I can't wait to have the love of my life back home. 

Thank you to everyone for sharing information, their experiences, and well wishes. It has greatly helped me in understanding that lucid dreaming may have been a contributing factor but was not the sole reason for what happened. 

**Update #2 on 6/7/2013 @ 1:00pm:** His case worker called to get any more information I may have and to let me know what was going on. They apparently believe it was an isolated case, except for what happened 9 years ago. Due to my boyfriend's progress and willingness to go along with the program, they hope to discharge him by the beginning of next week, possibly Monday or Tuesday. At that time we will be having a ""family meeting"" to further discuss things and hopefully get more solid information regarding a diagnosis or anything further. He will be going to an outpatient program 5 days a week. I'm hoping this outpatient program will have more time to delve deeper into what may have happened. While I would love to believe there is nothing more to be concerned about, I think we need to search a little bit longer and harder than they did last time instead of sweeping it under the rug.

I don't dream (or at least don't remember) my dreams very often not feeling like a have even slept, so when i do dream i usually forget to remember. The only solution i found was to force myself into rem sleep. I must admit i have only done it three times but if anyone can capitalise on the method and find a way to enhance it, that could open up into a whole new world.

Explanation:

first close your eyes (obvious) then instead of relaxing and trying to drift of focus on the weird little shapes that appear behind your eyes. Try and force them into shapes and focus on them, suddenly it will all become clear though for me at least at the start of the dream it is darker then begins to lighten up. Maybe I am just tricking myself and falling asleep, but once you do it for the first minute or so in the dream there is a large headache of... buzzy-ness, and concentrating on it i noticed that it is my brain processing the dream. I feel it very much in the  frontal lobes of my brain, after a while it slides to the back of my brain and i can ignore.

Soon enough, I gained lucidity. After walking around, I notice a girl identical to me right behind me. I turned to her and asked her, ""Who are you? Are you part of my unconscious?"" and some other sImilar questions. She just smirked at me and repeated those questions right back at me, in a very mocking tone. She walked off quickly afterwards and I let it go. 

The next night, in hopes of being able to talk to her again, I gained lucidity and proceeded to a hallway where a mirror was placed not far from me. I stared right at my reflection in the mirror and stuck my hands out to grab her by the shoulders and pull her out of there. My hands went through the mirror like a pond. She looked startled for a second then she began vibrating, like a huge energy was inside her, until I couldn't even make out her features. As I started pulling, I felt something pulling ME backwards as well! The harder I'd pull on her the more powerful it got; it felt like something inside was pulling me in all directions. It got so powerful and distracting that I lost concentration and woke up. 

So I was wondering if anyone had any idea about what she represented, and why she took up that mocking attitude. I find that attitude common with other people I encounter in a dream and ask questions about my unconscious. Also, what techniques can I use to make communicating with parts of my unconscious easier and more effective? What expriences have you had with such DCs?

(Quoted from a post on Ld4all forums)

**Step-by-step:**

The best time to practice is after 4 or 5 hours of sleep. You could also combine the practice with WBTB for maximum effect but it is not required. DO NOT do this at the start of your sleep -- it will NOT work! The only exception is afternoon naps since you enter directly into REM.
Repeat the following procedures 4 or 5 times. DO NOT attempt too many repetitions even if you don't feel anything. Remember you are not doing a WILD. You are simply setting things up for OBEs and LDs to occur at later point. If you repeat too many times you may risk losing sleep thus destroys the purpose.

1) With your eyes closed, stare at the darkness behind your eyelids for 15-20 seconds. Try to pick up any colors, lights, or images, but do not strain your eye muscle. If you see nothing but darkness, that's fine. Again, we are not striving to induce dreams from the waked state, so do NOT force it. It is perfectly fine to not feel anything.

2) Listen to the noises in your ears for 15-20 seconds. Chances are you will hear some light humming and buzzing sound. See if you can hear it more clearly. If you don't hear anything that's okay.

3) Notice any strange body sensations such as heaviness, tingling, and movements. Pay attention particularly to the head, hands, fingers, abdomen, feet, and toes. Again, it is perfectly fine if you don't feel anything strange.


The above steps should be performed in a relaxed manner, slowly, lazily, and without any rational thoughts. The 15-20 seconds duration is for your reference only, so do NOT count in your head! Chances are, after a couple of repetitions you will begin to feel sleepy, to the point your mind may drift away and forget to continue the exercise. Congratulations, this is exactly the effect we are after! When this happens just pull your mind back a bit and resume from where you drifted away. If you lost count of the repetitions then simply do a new set. It won't hurt.
Find the most comfortable position and try to fall asleep as quickly as possible! The quicker you fall asleep the more likely you will succeed later in your dreams!


**What's going to happen:**

Several things may happen through this exercise:

1) After you fall asleep, you may suddenly wake up with a strange sensation. You will feel wide awake, and your body weightless. At this point just do a reality check and roll out from your bed to begin an OBE.

2) You wake up with vibrations and other strange sensations. Hang onto these sensations will lead you into an OBE.

3) You suddenly become lucid in your dreams with no apparent reasons, or you may begin to suspect you are dreaming.

4) You have a False Awakening. Unlike the first experience, you may feel awake but still drowsy. FAs will occur frequently with SSILD, therefore you should get used to it and become good at identifying them.

5) A WILD or direct OBE. Phase entrance may occur during the repetition, with your mind still awake. When this happens, many of the sensations become amplified. You should stop doing any further exercises, and begin focusing on the sensations until you successfully enter the phase.


If all else fail you can try the following technique as a last resort. Upon waking up again, which you eventually will after step 3, try relax your head and allow it to sink into the pillow. If done correctly you will generate vibrations and enter an OBE from a fully waked state. This works because SSILD has prepared your body and mind to enter a phase easily. In fact if you increase the number of repetitions you may be able to do this even before you fall asleep from step 3!


Good luck to whoever tries it, combining this and WBTB has allowed me to have my only two LDs.

SSILD is a modern lucid dreaming technique. It is easy to learn, highly effective, and produces consistent results over period. I developed this technique in 2011 in order to teach lucid dreaming to fellow dreamers on a Chinese forum. The first written version of the technique was published under the title ""太玄功"", which literally translates to ""A Very Mysterious Technique"". This is rather fitting because at the time no one had the faintest idea why it worked. Despite this lack of theory, the feedback on the technique was overwhelmingly positive. Within just a few months we gathered many hundreds of success stories!

Building on this initial success, we continued to refine the technique, and it essentially became a collaborated effort among hundreds of people. The tutorial went through a few revisions, and with each version we saw improvements in ease of use and effectiveness. A year later I wrote the first English version of the tutorial and published it on a few lucid dream online forums. This time I chose the name ""Senses Initiated Lucid Dream"", partly to conform to the unofficial but widely accepted naming convention of LD techniques, and partly due to increased knowledge and understanding gained during the past year.

While people on these forums appear more slow to embrace a brand new technique, the result was nonetheless quite promising. Between DreamViews and LD4All, there are more than a hundred success stories recorded in 9 months, within only two threads.

Today, SSILD has become one of the most popular LD induction techniques on the Chinese forum, which has grown to host more than 80,000 members. The numbers of success stories are too numerous to count. Another exciting aspect is SSILD's long-term sustainability. Whereas many techniques appear to become less effective over period as the users' initial enthusiasm wane, SSILD delivers consistent performance, turning novices to experts, and experts to masters. For example, more than a dozen members on my tiny personal forum are able to induce LDs on a daily basis. One of them even logged nearly 500 LDs/OBEs in full detail within less than a year, a remarkable achievement by all means.

**Design Philosophy**

SSILD is designed from the ground up to be simple, ""idiot-proof"" even. It does not utilize advanced techniques such as relaxation and visualization, and stays away from delicate, non-measurable mental exercises. It despises the notion that lucid dreaming is more ""art"" than ""technique"". It does not require you to be gifted or creative, in fact, there is little room for improvisation. Just follow the simple steps outlined here and you should be all set. SSILD is made so concise that if you mix in other stuff you may actually end up creating negative impact on its performance.

**The ""Cycle""**

The core component of SSILD is called a ""Cycle"". Each cycle consists three steps:

*Focus on Sight*: Close your eyes and pay attention to the darkness behind your closed eyelids. Don't strain your eye muscles though. Your eyeballs should be resting, totally relaxed. If you don't see anything that's only normal. Do not attempt to spot visuals by moving your eyes around.

*Focus on Hearing*: Further relax your eyes and shift your attention to your ears. If the room is quiet enough you might be able to hear some noise inside your head or the sound of your heartbeat. However, if you can't hear anything it is okay to listen to external sounds too.

*Focus on Somesthetic Senses (Touch)*: Direct your attention to your body. Feel it and see if you spot any unusual sensations such as tingling, heaviness, lightness, spinning sensations, and so on. If nothing like these can be felt, you can also try to feel the weight of the blanket, your heartbeat, temperature of the air, etc.

The repeated stimulation on the senses enables SSILD to condition our mind and body into a subtle state that is optimized for lucid dream to occur naturally. We should keep this in mind so we don't make the common mistake of ""trying too hard"" during the cycles. Beginners usually want to see things, hear things, and feel things. When nothing unusual happens they become discouraged or even desperate. Avoid this mistake at all cost! One should not expect to experience anything phenomenal during the Cycle. In fact, it is better to expect NOTHING at all will happen.

**The Steps**

1). Go to bed early, preferably before 11pm. Set your alarm to wake up after 4 or 5 hours.

2). Get out of bed and stay awake for 5-10 minutes. I suggest you visit the bathroom, rinse your mouth, and walk around or stretch a little bit. Try not to become too awake though.

3). Return to bed and lie down in a comfortable position, preferably different from the one you usually use. This is to prevent you from falling into sleep prematurely. However, if you are the type of person who requires extra effort to fall asleep, you may want to use the usual position instead.

4). Perform the ""Cycle"" quickly, repeat 4-6 times. This serves as a warm-up exercise so each step should be very short, a few seconds should be sufficient.

5). Perform the ""Cycle"" slowly, repeat 3-4 times. This step is the most important one. You should take extra time during each step. Thanks to step 4, at this point you should have become sufficiently relaxed and you will find focusing on the senses become much easier. For example, your eyes will feel more relaxed, and you may get visuals such as lights, colors, or movements. You might also notice that the external sounds seem to be fading into the background. Do not get excited though. You should observe quietly and after a while move on to other senses. As far as timing goes we are flexible, but in general each step should take no fewer than 30 seconds.

During the slow cycles, you may become distracted by a lot of random thoughts. This is a good indication that you are close to falling asleep. Do not try to suppress these thoughts -- they are your friends. Imagine they are gentle waves and let them carry you and wash you away from the shore of reality. You will occasionally become alert and realize you have lost track of your exercise. No worry, just start from the beginning of a cycle and you should be fine.

6). Return to the most comfortable position and allow yourself fall into sleep as quickly as possible. Do not think too much and do not worry if it will work. The quicker you can fall asleep the more likely it will work. Have faith!

**What happens next**
One key characteristic of SSILD is that it is neither a WILD nor DILD technique. It is a hybrid. As such, it is important to become familiar with all the possible scenarios so you will maximize your chances.

1). Hypnagogia: when we enter a dream consciously, we often encounter various unusual hypnagogic sensations. These include the sensation of falling, floating, seeing lights and images, hearing sharp noises, and many more. In fact, sometimes you may encounter sensations so strange that they are beyond words. When we encounter these sensations, chances are we are already in a dream, or getting really close. SSILD is known to cause hypnagogia during the Cycles (although this effect should NOT be sought after). It's also not uncommon for you to wake up suddenly while being bombarded by intense hypnagogic sensations. When this happens you should not become excited. Be a passive observer and wait for the sensations to amplify. You could also nudge them a little bit mentally, but do not overdo it. As soon as the sensations become clearly identifiable you should be able to perform a successful reality check and get up. Typically the dream will start from your bedroom because subconsciously that's where you expect you will be. You can also stay in bed longer and use visualization to create a dream scene manually. In any event, it is important for you to stay calm when encountering hypnagogia. Do not speak to yourselves or analyze it mentally as doing so can cause the sensations to fade and eventually wake you up.

2). False Awakening: SSILD is known to cause a lot of FAs. Not any FA, but some super-realistic ones! A typical scenario goes like this -- you finished doing SSILD and fell asleep. Then suddenly you wake up. No lucid dreams, perhaps not even a normal dream! Feeling disappointed you get out of the bed... then you wake up again! It was all but a dream! SSILD's ability to frequently create this type of FAs have been well-documented by now. Therefore, you should definitely develop the habit of performing a reality check upon each awakening after doing SSILD, no matter how convinced you are about your not being in a dream. Another possible scenario is that you slip into sleep during a SSILD cycle, and an FA immediately takes over. When this happens you may suddenly feel awake and it seems you are about to suffer insomnia. Some users complained that SSILD was causing them to lose sleep, only later found out they had been doing SSILD cycles in their dreams! Once you learn to catch these FAs your chance of success will be greatly improved.

3). DILD: When you fall asleep from SSILD, you enter your dreams with heightened awareness. As a result, lucid dreams occur. This is called Dream Initiated Lucid Dream (DILD). With heightened awareness, you may be able to spot oddities in dreams and in turn become lucid. It is also very common for spontaneous lucid dreams to occur -- you suddenly become lucid for no apparent reason.

4). Real Awakening: You wake up again after doing SSILD. You do a reality check and this time it is real. Do not despair. You still have chances. Try to stay still, and immediately relax your head, allowing the back of it to sink into the pillow. Then you need to perform a few extra medium-paced SSILD cycles. At this stage it is quite possible for you to encounter strong hypnagogia sensations. If not, just finish the cycles and go to sleep. You will have a much higher chance to succeed this time.

**FAQ**

**Q: Can I do SSILD when I go to sleep?**
A: Yes you can, but it won't work. When you go to bed you typically start with a lot of NREM sleeps which are not ideal for lucid dream to occur. The level of acetylcholine (an important neurotransmitter which is a major driving force for lucid dreams) is also at lower level. Trying to lucid dream with any technique at this stage is a waste of time, even though this is the favorite mistake virtually every beginners make.

**Q: I'm used to go to bed late or have to get up early, can I still use SSILD?**
A: I suggest you do SSILD only when you have sufficient time. Even though it does not take up a lot of time to perform, you WILL be losing some sleeps. As such, for people who never get enough sleep, your best bet is to do SSILD at leisure.

**Q: Can I combine other breathing, meditation, relaxation techniques during or prior to doing SSILD?**
A: No. As mentioned earlier, SSILD is all about ""conditioning"". You condition your mind and body to the most optimal state for lucid dream to occur. This state, however, is very delicate. Mixing in other techniques will likely interfere with this state and cause negative impact on SSLID's performance. You're free to create your own routines once you master the technique, but for beginners I expect you to adhere to the instructions in this manual.

**Q: I get this itch... how am I supposed to stay still?**
A: You are not supposed to stay still! If you have an itch just scratch it. If you want to roll you roll. With SSILD you need to stay as comfortable as possible! Just do an extra cycle to compensate and you will be fine. This is in fact a major advantage over virtually all other methods.

**Q: My eyes strain/hurt when focusing on visions...**
A: Remember, you should NOT expect to see anything, so relax already! Do not strain your eye muscles. Your eyeballs should be resting, if not staying still. Performing a few quick cycles will also help you relax.

**Q: I can't feel anything when doing the cycles...**
A: We cannot stress this more -- it is OKAY to not feel anything, and it is WRONG if you actively pursue it and expect things to happen during the cycles. With the cycles you are setting a timer for the bomb to go off. You don't expect a bomb to go off WHILE you are setting the timer do you? Sure, it does go off occasionally...

**Q: I got insomnia after doing SSILD...**
A: Actually, performing SSILD correctly is likely to cure your insomnia. There is a remarkable resemblance between SSILD and Betty Erickson's self-hypnosis routine! Now back to the question. We need to first identify if we are taking about ""real insomnia"" or ""false insomnia"". Remember, SSILD likes to create these super realistic false awakenings. It is very possible for you to enter an FA while still performing the SSILD cycles. In this case you will be trying to fall asleep while you are already sleeping! Next time you find yourself unable to fall asleep during a cycle, you should definitely perform a reality check, no matter how convinced you are! For people who indeed suffers loss of sleep due to SSILD, I suggest you tweak your routines in two areas: 1. Reduce the amount of sleep before waking up for SSILD. 2. Reduce the time you spend on staying awake prior to the exercise.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,1360795354.0,,,True,t3_18h2bi,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/18h2bi/ssild_official_tutorial_20/,

Around one hour ago, I decided to have a quick nap, because I'm currently in Greece and while it's really beautiful here, it's also hot as hell and you get unbelievably tired in the midday. 
Anyway, some minutes ago, I had my first real lucid dreaming experience. I've been trying for so long... Although I have to admit that I've not been trying hard, I constantly had the idea of lucid dreaming and the techniques in mind everytime I fall asleep. 

Anyway. The dream was short. You know why? Because after around 3 minutes I decided to fly. And that's my first advice when trying to have a lucid dream: Upon getting lucid, don't freak out and directly start to fly. I did it sooo many times, and every time I directly woke up. The excitement and immersion is just way to big when flying - you should really do that when you're deeper in the dream and really fully control it. This also is true for anything else exciting. Don't do it directly, first you should explore the world a little bit, walk around, maybe just sit down and see what's happening. Don't decide to run or jump. It will only wake you up. Again, i ruined about 20-25 lucid dreams with this. It's extremely hard to even think about this in that moment, I know, but try.

Second advice. It's about Reality Checks. While this may sound strange and differ from other opinions by experienced dreamers, my personal advice is: don't focus too much on RCs as a beginner. Why? They will wake you up. Why? Because if you are in a normal dream an RC, the lucidness hits you in the face, gets you excited as hell, and unfortunately wakes you up when you're not experienced. Also this happened to me a lot of times... Again, this is only my personal experience, and I do see that RCs are something really great, but IMO they shouldn't be used by beginners.

So, how to get lucid? First, study your dreams. Make your dream recall great. Try to remember scenes from your dreams every morning, but don't get demotivated if you don't manage it every morning - if you don't naturally wake up, it's extremely hard to recall dreams because they tend to get ""overwritten"" by the first thoughts and impressions after waking up, for example shut up, fucking alarm clock. *EDIT: Also, when you wake up naturally, you wake up directly after an REM phase, so the dream is fresh in your mind, when you get woken up though, you can wake up somewhere in between and even interrupt an REM phase (thanks mon_dieu)*

So, now that you are aware of how the whole dreaming world functions, try to analyze the strange things in your dreams. You know, the crazy stuff you would tell your buddies. The boss that turned into a slimy monster, the teacher that made a backflip in class... If you feel like your dreams aren't exactly ""crazy"", try to remember every little detail. Some people dream totally crazy stuff, some dream scenes that seem quite ""normal"" first, but even if your dreams often seem normal, try to further look at the details - was anything strange about the environment? If your dreams take place in your school for example, see if the colors are right - does the dream school door have the same color as the real one? Is the environment right? Does this room even exist in RL? After you spend so much attention to the details, you start to think critically in your dreams, which normally isn't the case. Like this, you can get lucid ""step by step"", as I would call it, rather than BOOMINYOURFACE. You will, after some time get lucid without being able to recall an event that made you become lucid. It'll get you more in a way natural lucid dreams. 

And last advice: don't except or even try to have a lucid dream when going to sleep in the evening. You won't. It's nearly impossible, especially as beginner. But when should one try it then? If you wake up early in the morning, and decide to sleep again, this is one of the best times for a lucid dream. Your body skips all the previous parts of sleep, in which dreams don't take part in, and directly puts you in a REM phase, which is great for dreaming. The same applies for naps. 

So, that were my impressions after trying for about 11 months. Of course I can't provide any scientific proof for them, and also, sleep and everything about dreaming really varies from person to person, so you will have to see of my tips apply to you, too. I hope I could help some people!

And sorry for any poor formatting, I'm only online with my iPod right now.

Well, long story short, I had woken up early in the morning yesterday, and just by chance, had been lying in bed really still trying to get back to sleep when I started feeling the paralysis starting to set in (been practicing for two weeks now and just kept trying), and this time, my 
leg wasn't doing that unstoppable twitch.   So, I maintained my thoughts, and here's what surprised the crap out of me.  I was able to maintain COMPLETE and total clarity through the whole transistion process, which was good because I wasn't expecting the transition to 
be THAT fast.  Seemed like 20-30 seconds once the paralysis had completely set in.  And then SNAP, I was just sitting there in my bed as if I normally were when waking up, and the ONLY way that I was even suspecting that I was dreaming was because I was concentrating 
through the entire process and all of a sudden, my eyes were just open.   It was so clear and EVERYTHING in my bedroom was, for what I could recognize, in it's proper place with the exception of the dog kennel, which I just now realized.   

But anyway, I was suspicious, despite the fact that I was in my bedroom, that I was dreaming, so I decided I was going to create an energy ball between my hands, and to tell you the truth, at the time, it was just wishful thinking.  Imagine the WTF look I must have had 
on my dream face when it actually happened!  I mean damn, I know people say that they were in a very clear state of mind and that they were fully aware, but compared to normal dreams, it was a VERY clear state of mind.   I mean, in other dreams, you were just 'foggy' and things out of the ordinary were just accepted as normal by your brain.   But this, I could just feel the clarity of my thoughts.   

In my excitement though, I couldn't maintain the sleep state, and in all, it seemed like 30 seconds to a minute for the duration before I got too excited and woke up.  I've gone lucid in normal dreams before, but this WILD method was NOTHING like them at all due to my understanding that I was in a dream from the very beginning and just the sheer clarity of the dream.  Basically a mirror of real life. 

But I wanted to thank the people of this subreddit for introducing me to the concept of lucid dreaming (don't know how I originally found this), and right when I was about to give up, it happened... briefly, but it happened, and it far surpassed my expectations.  And now, I have 
a  more scientfic understanding of sleep paralysis that I had when I was a kid and getting freaked out, people having out of body experiences, and some of the things described by people of ancient cultures that were done during a state of deep meditation.  Everything 
tends to point to lucid dreaming and a realization that the mind was not in a normal reality state right off the bat.  

I mean, wow!!! Just wow!  So the next step is achieving this on a more regular basis and actually being able to stay within the dream state without getting excited and waking up.

With this said, I would like to hear from anyone reading this if you've noticed anything similar.  

If any of you remember your dreams quite well you might have observed some pretty strange things. When you wake up and recall your dream you probably say something like ""Wow. I can't believe I didn't realize that was a dream! It was so clearly fake! I must be an idiot"" I will now address why I believe we become so gullible to such a strange world. It is because of what I like to call ""The Backwards Card House Effect""

I've noticed in several of my dreams my brain likes to begin with a very small impossible task. Something so small that you might actually consider it quite possible. For example a glitch in a game. You get a mushroom in super mario but instead gain fire powers. ""Whoa! I just glitched the game!"" Simple yet laying the stepping stones for your dream world. It slowly progresses exponentially. ""Whoa a secret level I never seen before!"" Until you believe anything your dream throws at you. Thus ""The Backwards Card House Effect"" One lie holds all the other lies in place. The 2nd row holds up the 3rd row correct? And the 3rd holds up the 4th. But if that first card is not in place the whole house comes falling down.

Thus, in your daily life whenever you learn something new, especially if you never thought that was possible, do a reality check. Regularly, I feel like reality checks are related to the situation you are in. Thus if you are sitting at a table and do a RC you will only do a RC in your dream if you are sitting at a table. This method I am showing you applies to all the craziness in your dream world.

Some examples I've seen in my dreams.

This Wednesday I will go to his sentencing and watch him condemned to prison.

About two-two and a half months after the incident I had an LD that shook me to my core, and it's because I believe I met a part of myself that is somewhat separate from ""me"".


This is an interpretation (with character and plot explanations) of what I wrote down in the morning when I awoke:



The dream began in the community that I grew up in. It was summer and I saw the neighborhood exactly as it had been when I first moved there at 13. I ran up my front porch and into my house to find my mother, a friend of hers, and my friend Amber sitting at the dinner table. I joined them and we chatted about nothing for a few minutes before Amber’s father called her to come home. She lived directly across the street from me, so she returned after only a couple of minutes.

“My dad’s coming over for some food,” she said, rolling her eyes.

“There’s enough for him!” chimed my mom. “Phil’s welcome any time.”

I heard our screen door open and something struck me as odd. It was when I saw his face that I realized I was dreaming. I quickly stood up and looked around me. 

“Great!” I exclaimed. 

Everyone looked stunned. 

“I’m dreaming,” I explained passively. “Phil, you’re dead.”

“I don’t feel dead,” he said thoughtfully. 

I took him by the arm and led him to my door. Before opening it I looked him in the eyes and said, “Four years ago you took a shotgun to your head in your shed. I saw that shed before I came in here for dinner. I know for a fact that the shed was removed after your suicide, and when I open this door you will see an empty slab of cement where it used to be.”

I opened the door and pulled him out onto the porch with the others close behind. I pointed to the place where the shed had once stood, and then looked back at my company to see how they were taking the news. Phil vanished in front of my eyes; my mother and her friend became hysterical and ran back into the house; and Amber sported a horrified look of betrayal.

“You killed my father,” she whispered sinisterly.

“Calm down,” I said, “none of this is real.” 

I did not fear Amber in this dream. I felt protective if anything because I felt the dream momentarily destabilize and had to struggle to keep some amount of control over it. I heard a deep rumble and swung back around to face the surrounding neighborhood. The houses began to crumble, leaving only half of each one standing. Some crumbled vertically, some horizontally, and I grabbed Amber and swung her off of the porch on the off chance that I accidentally knocked my own house down on top of her. I had no concern for my mother and her friend, as they were out of my sight, and therefore no longer technically there. 

SIDENOTE: You’re probably going to wonder why I wanted to protect Amber, knowing that she was imaginary. The answer is: it’s good for me. It’s good for my values in and out of the dream, and it’s good for keeping me connected with the dream.
 
We began to run in between the houses, which had stopped dissolving at this point. I knew-- I just had a feeling-- that this dream was about to turn into a shit storm. I repeatedly assured Amber that nothing was going to happen to her, that I would protect her from whatever dangers were coming and that she would feel no pain. 

We were turning a corner when I saw what would be my first obstacle. A gigantic, ethereal-looking goat stood grazing in an alley of conjoined backyards. When he heard us, he looked up slowly, his jaw grinding the grass he’d collected. 

“Shit. Shit shit shit!” I whispered vehemently.
 
I stepped in front of Amber’s body to shield her before finally deciding it was time for her to leave. I wasn't about to watch something happen to her, however imaginary it was.

“Run,” I murmured seriously.

“But…” she whimpered with wide eyes.

“GO! You’re not real!” and I pushed her hard. She disappeared around the corner and I turned to face my what I assumed was my foe again.
The giant goat was slowly bearing down on me and I stood my ground uncertainly. As he walked, his head and torso began to morph into a human’s and he stood on his hind legs. Eventually, all but his legs had a human form, and he was…beautiful. Standing at least six feet tall, he had long blonde hair and a sharp jawline, and a lean, smooth body. I wasn’t sure what to make of him. I lifted my fists as if to fight and he laughed. 

“You still aren’t very good at this,” he said gruffly.  

He put his left hand on my right shoulder and pushed me down. He climbed on top of me, this satyr, and I immediately came so hard that it woke me. I considered getting up to check the mess, but decided I’d rather get back to the dream. I fell back into it with no problem, but the sexually appealing satyr was gone. 

I needed to find him. 

I want to clarify that I was not seeking him out for further sexual gratification. I began seeking him out because there was something new about the encounter.* You still aren’t very good at this.* Did he mean controlling and protecting myself in my dreams? I had been having lucid nightmares for years. 

I ran around the wasteland that used to be my neighborhood for about a half an hour before giving up and walking back to my porch to wait to wake up. I walked inside of my house to see if anyone was there but it was empty. It was then that I heard a knock at the door. I opened it to see the blonde--now in full human form--in khaki pants and an over-sized red t-shirt. He jerked his head backward as if to say come on and then made a run for it. I chased him down to a hillside strewn with boulders. He leaned against a rock arrogantly, flicking pebbles with his bare toes. 

“Thanks,” I said.

“For what?” he asked without looking at me.

“For coming back. You’re not like the others, are you?”

“I suppose not.”

(I had often spent time with vapid dream characters who simply annoyed me with their insistence that they were not of my creation, as suggested by my short dialogue with Amber, Phil, my mother, and her friend.)

“Can I bounce some ideas off you?”

“Bounce ideas off me,” he snorted derisively. “I am you.”

“Oh shut up,” I snapped, so frustrated that I was on the verge of tears. “You must have access to things I don’t.”

“For a reason, maybe?”

“Bullshit! Personalities should not be split…” I trailed off. “I’m going to make a brave speculation and say you’re my subconscious.”

“Hmm… at least part of it.” He still had not looked at me.

“Look at me, damnit.”

“You’re bossy, and I don’t really need to be here,” he said in a mock-childish voice.

“But you are,” I said. “Why do you appear so attractive to me?”

“Well, you’re lonely, aren’t you?”

“And you touched me because…”

“You looked like you needed a guilt-free orgasm.”

I continued to study him and he looked up at me
.
“This takes self-love to a whole new level,” he chuckled.

I began to cry. “I can tell you’re stronger that me.”

“No,” he said sternly. “You’ve forgetting that I am you. Isn’t that what you’re always wasting your time explaining to these dream people?”

I sobbed silently. It was getting harder to focus on the dream; my surroundings were starting to slip. 

“You’ve got to help me! I don’t want to wake up!”

His hard demeanor cracked and I saw pity in his eyes.

“You know it doesn’t work like that, trifling_turkey. You know that. You’ll wake up every morning until you don’t, and when that day comes neither of us will be here.”

This is the last solid sentence I remember coming from him, as my hysterical state was throwing the dream into disarray. 

I’m going to give you the real crazy now (I didn’t realize this until a few months ago): ever since the “meeting with my subconscious”, I’ve had a prominent, somewhat sarcastic voice egging me on through things I would not have been previously able to accomplish. When I get really low, the voice begins overthrowing my defeatism in an aggressive manner. 

“Make your bed, trifling_turkey, it’s not that complicated. You can do this,” it will say, or, “Put that fucking bottle down, you drunkard, you’re on your way to destroying everything again.” Occasionally, I can banter with this voice and tell it to back off if it’s being a dick, but generally it’s looking out for my best interests and I accept it as part of me. 

Did I trigger this when I asked for help in the dream? People will argue.

Some good, and some bad. Of course, as our numbers grow, so too will this type of thread. Often, these stories don't add much to the conversation beyond relaying an experience. 

All that aside, I've been thinking that perhaps there is a way we can harness, collect and quantify massive amounts of useful data and information from these posts. Because everyone on here is here to learn, why not include more information in your post that we can put together into a handy breakdown of this sub's activity and most common practices?

For example, if every new post included information like:


* Induction Technique


* Preferred RC


* Number of Dreams Recorded


* Length of Time Between Learning About LDs and Actually Having One


* Dietary Supplements 


* Time Asleep and Time of Induction (thanks, banjanga1)


We could then put all this information into a spread sheet and, voila, we've just gotten a nice little detailing of what things have been working for our beginners. This could take place annually, or if we are dedicated enough, monthly to see regularities and other useful patterns within our community. 

If there's enough interest, I'll create a template that we can use and riff off of. And, hey, if someone posts without putting in this info, we can direct them to it and have them edit it after. It will be a good way for them to learn the lingo and what exactly they did to get there while simultaneously helping out the entire Lucid Dreaming community.

I'd love to hear all your thoughts on this and any additional information that may be relevant to these types of posts. Thanks guys!

In most of my LDs, instead of always just constantly doing the power, control, flying, altering the dreamscape thing, I naturally prefer to curiously explore and focus on the details of the dreamscape and its physics. 

That way, I'm constantly ""discovering"" and exploring and noticing discrepancies (which in turn KEEPS me lucid -- KNOWING that I'm not in reality). Because I only manipulate things and use powers, fly, etc every so often, my LD self is in a constant state of paying attention and thus, remaining lucid. In other words, I dont get caught up -- and thus distracted -- in just flying or using powers the entire time. Although using powers and manipluating things IS cool as hell, I prefer to use them sparingly.  

It's like while awake, I practice ADA (All DAY Awareness) to know that I'm in reality and while I'm asleep, my LD self exploring my dreamworld is like practicing ANA (All NIGHT Awareness) to maintain awareness that I am not in reality -- which keeps me lucid.

Therefore, next time you go lucid, try to invest more time and focus on exploring the dreamscape and its physics and use your powers sparingly -- instead of just constantly flying around.

I've had one lucid dream in my life, about a year ago.  I was out in the middle of nowhere, dressed in a long black coat.  I was on the porch of an old house, with creaky wooden boards and faded paint.  I can't remember what I was doing there.  I'm not sure what triggered it- elements of the dream seemed familiar, though it wasn't one of the recurring dreams I know by heart- but I suddenly had a thought: I'm dreaming, and this isn't real.  So, I did the first thing I knew I could never do in real life.

I flew.

It was one of the happiest moments I've ever had.  I looked up to the sky, held my arms against my sides, and willed myself upwards.  The speed of it was incredible; I was in space within a second or two.  The sensation was wild; I knew where I wanted to go (up), but the speed of the flight was unexpected.  It was like I was in control, but also out of control all at one time.  It was incredible.

So, I hovered in space looking down at the Earth.  It was serene, peaceful.  A perfect moment.  

I'm not sure how long I stayed up there.  The last thing I remember is hearing my alarm go off inside of my dream.

Anyway, clothes off ('I' didn't take my clothes off) in a second and I (or is it 'we') get right into it.  I start oral and almost immediately I am overcome with indescribable pleasure.  It feels like I am having multiple simultaneous orgasms.  This feeling is so new and overpowering I think that I am cumming in real life.  This thought makes the dream fall apart and I awake. I had not cum.

Is the intensification of pleasure just part of lucid dreaming sexual experiences? I've had dreams where I am crushed in a tornado, but I felt no pain.  Tactile sensation in this context was completely different (I'm glad the pain of death doesn't register!).

As I lay there letting my arms and legs go numb and not much happening, I remembered something which I never really investigated upon. By simply rolling my eyes back into head, not completely, just the equivilant of trying to look at your eyebrows, the WILD process was suddenly sped up. My eyes were twitching and that feeling of zooming/sinking away from your body came on instantly and suddenly my vision became very wide as if I had my eyes open. I knew that I didn't though because it was too dark. Anyway despite this and because of my amateurness at LDing (only one MILD), I didn't end up WILDing, probably because my heart was beating too much. Basically everytime I rolled my eyes, it worked. The longer/harder you hold them, the bigger the effect which lasts as long as you hold them. But this doesn't sustain forever, so you have to take them back and then you can do it again.

After going flying with a glider for a little bit, I land and meet a young boy, maybe 12 years old or so. We talk a little, and I ask him if he wants to go flying too. He accepts, and I ready the glider, but I turn to him and say: ""First, before we go, there's something you need to know. None of this is real. This whole world is a creation of my mind, including you."" He seems shocked, and I hear a really creepy witch-like voice shrieking out at me, as if I'm violating some basic law of the universe by telling him this.

Sure enough, I wake up that instant. We never get to go flying.

But in my still semi-conscious state immediately upon awakening, I think: Maybe that kid's in a better place now. I took him on his last flight, out of the world of illusion.

This got me thinking: **Was the boy in my dream conscious?** Are any dream characters conscious? Is there any scientific basis for believing that a subsystem of my own mind might have a mind and thoughts of its own? Did he die when I awoke? Or did he merge with the universal consciousness of that world (i.e. me)?

**EDIT**: I'm sorry to inform you that this experiment was a bit of a failure. There was some weed left in the bowl and I've heard that weed has an anti effect to the Calea herb(also I just got really high). But I do remember having some amazing and clear dreams, mostly i just woke up really high a number of times in the night.
But I cleaned the bong and everything is ready for a clean new experiment.

I also read that when smoked in large quantities has a mild cannabis feeling but without the apathy. So I'm also going to try that tomorrow. If anyone is interested in hearing that goes, I'll put that in the comments tomorrow as well. Sorry about that again.

**EDIT2**: So last night I set my alarm to wake me up at 03 A.M(4 hours before i wake up.) and smoked 2 bowls of the plant and went to sleep again. before I finally fell asleep I began to feel very happy and my whole body tingled and numbed. It was a sort of a mild cannabis like feeling, I had read about that happening [here](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=12224). 

When I woke up I didn't remember having any dreams at all during the night. But after being awake for 4 hours I suddenly remembered that I had one of the most entertaining, long and vivid dream ever! Remembering it felt like remembering a movie after 5 minutes after you finished it. But as if you had been in the movie, experiencing it yourself. I didn't go lucid but defenetly had a blast. I recomend this plant. But dont set your expectation too high, this plant may have different effects depending on individual. You can buy an Oz of it at [Arena Ethnobotanicals](http://www.arenaethnobotanicals.com/dream-herb-calea-zacatechichi-p-159.html?affiliate_banner_id=1&amp;amp;ref=344) for just $10. or at [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/listing/93691424/dream-herb-5g-all-natural-burnable-herb?ga_search_query=Dream)

 I'm new here so I thought I'd introduce myself. I've been lucid dreaming for a little over a decade now but I haven't applied much technique or tried to develop any sort of reliable process to LDing until I found this subreddit. 

That said I have had what I consider to be a great deal of documented* LDs since I first became aware of them. To the best of my knowledge I am averaging about 3 - 4 LDs a year with that number slowly increasing due to my own haphazard efforts. 

I cannot remember how it started in terms of technique. My LD emerged as a product of liking dreams so much that I simply wished to explore them as much as possible. I assume that this strong positive association made it more likely for my mind to spontaneously RC, as I would frequently find myself wishing to be asleep and dreaming during my waking life.

These days I employ incessant reality checks. Every time my scenery changes I do an RC. Literally every time. Even something as simple as getting a glass of water can contain at least 3 RCs  (Computer Room -&gt; Hallway -&gt; Kitchen). 

As for what I can do in my dreams once I have completed an RC, that is a topic that is not as interesting as it once was for me. As such I will be light on the details of my dreams unless they are somehow pertinent to the conversation. I am more interested now in what I can do with the dreams themselves than I am in flying around, shooting lasers out of my eyes, and whatnot.

This community looks to be very exciting to say the least. There is a wide range of people here with an equally wide range of experiences and outlooks, I've seen a lot of really good ideas already but I cannot wait to hear more. So in that vein I would like to ask you, the reader, to share with me some of your more profound experiences with LDing. While I am not inclined to talk about how I can fly if that is something really exciting for you please share. I only have one condition: tell me how you think you can push this further than you have already. I don't simply mean flying longer, higher, farther, or the addition of other abilities. Rather I mean to ask, how do you thin you can take this to the next level? If we are metaphorically like infants crawling about, how do we figure out how to get up and walk around, or climb? What does it all mean? Are we discovering fundamental aspects of the mind, or are we simply exploring the depths of our own respective psyches? 

For example now that I am comfortable manipulating my dreams I will try to pull back the curtains, to see if I can open the very fabric of my dreams. This has produced mixed results to say the least. On more than one occasion I have been shadowed by a group of strange creatures who seemed vested in preventing me from LDing, once I had an successful RC things turned nasty very quickly and I was pinned down by the lot of them save one. The last one gave me a quick swipe to the neck and I was thoroughly ejected from my own dream which is a puzzling sensation to say the least. Has anyone had a similar experience with ""rogue agents of the mind"" seeming to act contrary to your will?

Thank you for sticking with me this long, I look forward to working with you all in the future.

My method explained.,adamwilliam,149,30,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/z1u8b/having_tons_of_lds_my_method_explained/,"  For the past week or so, I've been sleeping on a couch in a loft while I settle in with my family. I've really always been interested in lucid dreaming, astral projection etc.., but I only recently started trying to control my dreams again and I've had a ton of success. I still don't really know why, but sleeping on this couch has boosted my dreams and my dream remembrance (either that, or the NyQuil..), and I've been lucid dreaming for about 3 days straight now. The first night I woke up naturally at about 4am, and decided to give it a go. Closed my eyes, prepared myself, all that stuff you already know. Then, I did something that really has helped me pull myself under before. I crossed my eyes slightly, and somehow I managed to fall asleep while fully conscious.

**Night 1**: I'm not really sure if crossing the eyes is a proven technique, but some googling will probably tell. I then woke up (can't remember where) and started walking. I jumped, did some flips, and floated back down to the ground. I got so excited that I woke up.

**Night 2**: I woke up at around 4am again and went to pee. Came back, got situated with my arms at my sides and proceeded to drift off again. Crossed my eyes and went under. When I'm in a lucid dream, I constantly have this sort of pressure on me that I know could wake me up. It gets a little annoying sometimes but I learned to take control of it. Anyways, I felt that pressure and decided to do an RC. I looked at my hands and they kind of looked like I was crossing my eyes at them and creating a third hand in the middle. I decided I was dreaming and jumped out the window, still unable to fly. Did some crazy shit and woke up again from becoming too excited.

**Night 3**: I won't explain waking up or peeing or any of that again, as I've already done it twice. I crossed my eyes again and went into a dream in which I was sitting on a bed that I've never been in before in a completely foreign room. I knew I was dreaming, so I created a drink for myself and grabbed it from beside the bed. My mom walked into the room and I felt the need to make the drink disappear so I just put it under the comforter and made it vanish. I read something about the ability to create a door to a different world, so I put a door on the side of the wall and opened it. I ended up walking into the Sahara and then again waking up due to extreme excitement. It sucked because I wanted so desperately to go back into the dream but I was kept awake by the desire.

I guess the point of this post is to tell you, r/LD, to try something new. Crossing my eyes really helped me pull myself into a lucid state, and I think it'd help all of you too!

I identify with all the pessimism I read on this subreddit about having no luck and trying to pin down exactly why it hasn't worked for you. I've been in your shoes and I understand the frustration BUT

2. I feel confident in saying that even if you think you haven't reached lucidity, you probably have (likely a number of times) but don't remember it. Which leads me to the practice of...

3. Reading a post or two every night before bed. This has increased my dream recall and likelihood of doing RC's by such a large margin that I hesitate to even give a percentage. In fact, I don't know if it would have been possible for me to have the willpower to work on dream recall and reality checks if this awesome community did not give me daily reminders. Reminders like:

4. HANDS HANDS HANDS!!! My first amazingly vivid LDs were initiated by RC'ing with a quick finger-counting. As of late it has been failing me (""Oh 8 fingers, this must be a dream... never mind I must have grafted those on recently."") But I recently read a post about someone who swore by rubbing their hands together immediately after doing an RC. 
 I will track the post down, if for no other reason to give OP a huge thanks. Many times I have lost lucidity only moments after doing an RC but the hand-rubbing has given me the best tool I've learned for perpetuating the awareness. But for me to even get to the point of doing an RC, I've been practicing...

5. Realizing that your ""waking"" life is JUST as absurd as a dream. You have to wipe the idea that THIS is real and THAT is not from your mind, and realize that every moment you perceive is just as real as the next. 
 What I mean is don't be so preoccupied with labeling your experience as a dream or not, just let yourself EXPERIENCE (v.).
Continually remind yourself that life is absurd, all living things are dependably crazy (in bad, good, and wonderful ways), and you have no idea what every moment can bring. Whatever moment you find yourself in is a moment that you have prepared for your whole life; relish in it.

I remember the first day I found out about it, googling ""Lucid Dreaming"" after seeing an IAmA from a 30+ year dreamer. That night I went to sleep with pure excitement, what if I could lucid dream? As a result, I had *perfect* dream recall and woke up right after each dream. I noted each in my journal, and went back to happy sleep. Still no luck.

About a week in, I had my first lucid experience, but as soon as I realized I was dreaming everything began to vibrate violently and I was shaken awake. It may have been disappointing, but it fueled my interest. Last week a similar thing happened, except this time I was able to ""feel"" my surroundings. Definitely progress.

Now over these experiences I found that I was losing a bit of interest. Between failed attempts and restless nights, I wanted to help some of you other beginners with the mistakes I made.

1. If you plan on trying a technique like MILD, don't go to sleep completely tired. For me, I can hardly recall any parts of my dream when I go to sleep tired.

2. Maintain your journal! It may take some willpower to force yourself awake, but it will definitely pay off in finding your dream sign.

3. Regarding dream signs, I had a hard time finding mine because I can't remember all my dreams at once. Read over your journal after you've gotten about a month of info, highlighting recurrences between your dreams.  Doing that today taught me that I'm always in a car at some point in my dream.

4. Reality checking with MILD must become a habit (or a triggered reaction) to work. However, make sure you change it up! For the first few weeks, I did the 5-finger check. I soon realized that when I asked myself ""Am I dreaming?"" I would instantly get and answer ""No"" without even thinking. When reality checking, do something with a dynamic answer, like ""where am I?"" ""Is this logical?"" These will force logical thoughts, which are essential in achieving lucidity. 
&gt;Really know and think about the purpose of RCs every time you do one.

5. Lucid dreaming takes dedication. At times you will have to force yourself to do things, such as waking up to write in your journal, going to sleep early, or simply meditating. All of these things are a necessary burden, so be prepared to sacrifice some of your time (and sleep!).

6. If you happen to achieve lucidity, stay calm. Getting too excited can and probably will wake you up. It may be hard to control yourself, but this is something I'm learning to do through meditation, and helps dream stability.

7. Stay motivated! Over the course of my first month, I began to lose interest in lucid dreaming. Not because I didn't want it, just because I was accustomed to seeing failure. To keep my interest and hope high, I read about other people's experiences. It helps with creativity and is usually exciting, which may help you the way it helped me.

After some research, meditation, and ""LD"" supplements I was flying through the skies of my mind like a deity. Soon I began questioning; How is all this possible? I did extensive research on consciousness and realized it's the biggest mystery of all and it seemingly allows everything to exist(at least in my mind)... Years later, here I am, with my eyes set on an eternal journey of infinite possibility.

What now? - Noob guide to dream control.,gorat,139,19,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/rk8te/its_a_dream_what_now_noob_guide_to_dream_control/,"*Disclaimer: People that have been LDing consistently or want to add something, please do so in the comments and I will add it. Let's help each other have great dreams!*

**Intro**

Ok ladies and gents, the [previous guide on getting your first LD](http://redd.it/rgpse) seemed to go down well, but what I noticed from the questions in the comments is that a lot of people are looking for info on what to do when in the dream, how to stabilize and how to control the dreamscape. I am about to go all buddha on you, so don't freak out, control is a lot about centering and such and a lot about attitude. No fancy terminology and all real world applications. Promise...

So without further delay, and as proposed by the sages of old, sit back, put [some music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3NlwGX-shA) on and let's get to it...

**Attitude**

Your dream is yours and yours only. Get that in your head and never forget it. Everything in that dream from the sky to the sand, the people, the buildings, its all created by your brain for your pleasure. It is there for your taking and your control. Think about all the power for a second. Feel the warmth of it going through your arms. Do you feel like you can throw a fireball right now? You should...

**You are GOD!**

and you know it! That is exactly the meaning of being lucid.

So first advice. As soon as you become lucid, don't think ""I'm LDing"", think ""I AM GOD!"" - really. Keep this in mind.

**Balance is key**

Balance your thoughts between keeping a vivid dreamscape and keeping the realization of yourself. This is the balance that needs to be kept, and as always practice and consciousness makes perfect.

I will give you a couple in-dream techniques and a couple real-life techniques.

**Real Life Balancing**

Take a moment and do this for me. Look away from the screen, half close your eyes so that things become a bit fuzzy around the edges and try to feel in your mind the texture of the walls around you, the thoughts and intentions of people that might be there and also feel the life in your body. It's a bit hard at first but you will get the hang of it. Keep squinting like an idiot and contently rub your hands together. Do you feel the sensation of one hand against the other?

&lt;OK just stop reading and do what I said - take a couple of minutes to get into it&gt;

If you are doing this right you should have no other thoughts beyond your surroundings and yourself. This is a good way to practice control (centering - mindfulness) and is a very good approximation of what it feels like in a lucid dream. Imagine that if you let go of the thoughts of specific things they will slowly start to become more and more fuzzy. As soon as you notice them in your thoughts they will gain life and detail. The same goes for your dream-body... Take some time every day to try this while thinking about LDing. I believe it will help with inducing LDs and with control. If you have LDed before then try to add the sensation of the dream in it...

**In the dream**

The balance between self and surroundings is the most important. If you get too lost in your surroundings the awareness of self is lost. The other way around and your dreamscape fades. So what to do?

*I am losing control of myself / overexcited*

* First do a simple RC. Remind yourself you are dreaming.
* Rub your hands together as practiced before. Calm and Center on yourself. 
* If previous steps fail: Spin around yourself looking at your hand - you may end up somewhere different or awake.
* as a last resort: Shout as hard as you can (I AM GOD) - this is fun by itself...

*Dreamscape is fading*

* Use your sensations to stabilize dream. Focus on the textures of the things around you. Focus on the colors and the details of some dream objects.
* Stop talking to people and look around.
* if other steps fail:  Spin around yourself looking at your hand - you may end up somewhere different or awake.

*Dreamscape is too dark, scary, cold, hot, etc etc*

You *do* know you have a remote control for your dream right? It's in your right pocket. I thought I should let you know. Take it out, don't look at it too much, press the button that does what you want to do and it will do it.

Some people have the automated system installed. Clap twice and the dream becomes sunny. Clap once and it is night. Try it out, it doesn't work for everybody...

This is an example of how you must think in your dream (and I'm serious about the remote control. It's in your right pocket...) Believe and it will be done. Command with a knowledge that you are in control.

**All good things come to an end**

As everything in life, your LD will come to an end sooner or later. Mastering dream control is a long process but almost as important as getting LDs in the first place. While you are in the LD, take note of the special feeling that you have. You can use it when awake to induce LDs.

**Outro**

As soon as you become lucid don't start jumping around and being excited. Squint a bit as practiced, center yourself and take in all that is around you. When you open your eyes fully again your dream will be vivid. Rub your hands. Stabilize. Be cool my son. Balance your fun and excitement with controlling your environment and the LD will stabilize more and be more vivid.

If you don't like something in your dream use your remote control to change it. Or your iphone if you are so inclined :)

Happy Dreaming all and let me know about your experiences!

Could have implications for lucid dreaming.,LiquidZebra,201,86,148,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/16qfto/porn_use_rewires_the_male_brain_could_have/,"I found this interesting website, which lists a bunch of recent studies on brain plasticity:
[Your brain on porn](http://yourbrainonporn.com/) there are a few lectures, and while the site is about porn, the broader term for the phenomenon is IAD: Internet addiction disorder. It includes video games ( and likely too much time on reddit).
  
In short, porn is bad for you, as it changes the reward circuitry and affects dopamine reuptake and dopamine receptor number. The extreme side effect mentioned is erectile dysfunction in the 20s, along with depression and social anxiety symptoms. The site recommends 90 day abstinence to ""reboot"" the reward circuitry.
  
 Since science still does not know the purpose of dreaming, chances are very high that the use of porn, and changes to the reward system have an impact on dreaming... Whether is is good or bad, I do not know, but the result is likely chaotic in nature.
 
**EDIT** found evidence on Wikipedia:[dopaminergic activation in dreaming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience_of_dreams#Dopaminergic_activation)
&gt;Damage to the dopaminergic pathway **results in a loss of dreaming**.

The dopaminergic pathway is a part of limbic system, described on that site

[Dopamine Imbalances Cause Sleep Disorders in Animal Models of Parkinson’s Disease and Schizophrenia
](http://www.dukehealth.org/health_library/news/9904)
&gt;First, the researchers treated the mice with a chemical that stops the production of dopamine entirely. In fairly short order, the mice had used up their initial supply of dopamine and were running on empty.

&gt;The mice became rigid, immobile, and **unable to sleep or dream**, displaying symptoms similar to those experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease, the researchers said.
  
**edit2** finally, from this paper: [Dreaming and REM sleep are controlled by different brain mechanisms](http://neuro.bstu.by/ai/To-dom/My_research/Papers-2.1/Cognitive-S/Consciousness/For-icnnai-2010/2/Ref/download.pdf) (thank you for the link):

&gt;These facts suggest that the **mesocortical-mesolimbic dopamine system plays a causal role in the generation of dreams**.


PS. Please note that I do not talk about masturbation, it is irrelevant. What matters is what happens to your dopaminergic reward system from long term (think 10 years) of porn use and how it affects dreaming.

Not all of them are nice, and the majority of those posts come from people who are angry about the fact it doesn't detect REM cycles, and therefore it's hit-and-miss whether it actually catches you in a dream cycle or not. First, read carefully before you buy - especially in a start up. But that's beside the point.

Another major hit I hear is that, along with the lack of REM detection, it's not going to be a magic bullet for novices, and therefore give future devices a bad name. Here's why I respectfully disagree with this school of thought:

When someone decides they want to make a breakthrough in, say, bioengineering, they don't get up off the couch, buy a giant supercomputer, switch it on, and watch the next great genome research magically appear on the screen - that's silly. No, they spend incredible amounts of time researching their topic, learning all they can, making lots of tiny breakthroughs. They could, of course, do it all by hand. But they buy a supercomputer because it will help them. Perhaps it doesn't do EVERYTHING they need; they may need to adjust their process a bit or try some different approaches to the theory. But in the end, the computer will probably help - and won't help every single biotech researcher in the same way.

Similarly, the Remee is not, in any measure, a lucid dreaming mask any more than a supercomputer is a bioengineering answer book. The Remee is a little mask with lights in it. It won't make you lucid dream. But it is a tool. And again, like the supercomputer, the average Joe Schmo is going to try it, have no flipping idea how to get it to tell him the answers, and write it off as useless.

But LDers are more than the average Joe Schmo. They don't just put on a Remee and hope for the best. They journal. The do RC's. They are intensely and rigorously trying their very best to dream. And they see the Remee as a tool. Some it may help, some it may not. Regardless, it will be something different to all people. Some will use it to trigger in-dream RC's.

* OK to be fragmented - I am often frustrated by incoherent journal entries as my dream assembles in my memory. It's a lot easier to explain skipping around in a dream verbally than writing it.

* Repetition - I record my dream, roll out of bed and shower.

I definitely recommend it to people with irregular sleep schedules.,FusionX,152,39,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1e6k8y/has_anyone_tried_deild_i_definitely_recommend_it/,"I accidentally discovered this technique myself. Here's a [link](http://www.dreamviews.com/induction-techniques/126343-yuppies-deild-guide-easiest-way-lucid-dream.html) to an article with a better explanation. But here's how I do it:

What happens is, sometimes you wake up from a dream and you're still in half-sleep state from where you can choose to wake up if you want to. But don't, lay perfectly still and don't open your eyes. Now breathe deeply, and you'll find a very strange sensation, hard to describe in words. With each breathe you'll find yourself absorbing more and more into your dream state. For me, a minimum of 3-4 breaths is enough to know that I'm in a lucid state. And now, open your eyes and you'll wake up in a dream, if done right.

Pros:

1. Doesn't require a strict sleep schedule.

2. Even if you find your dream getting out of hand and you wake up, you can repeat the process indefinitely.

3. Very easy to do.

4. With practice, you can even use the half-sleep state when you transition from consciousness to sleep, so dream isn't required. This one's tough.

5. Doesn't really require a reality check and although you can do one. I've stopped reality checks now because I forced myself to believe that when in doubt if it's a dream, it is. Reality checks are a bit unreliable for me anyway.

6. Once mastered, it's easier than WILD.

Cons:

1. You can not control when it happens, it may not come to you in weeks or may happen 3 days in a row.

2. You may not be as lucid as in other techniques such as wild.

3. Lucidity can be weird sometimes. I find myself seldom getting stuck to my bed or getting a quarter of my vision blocked.

4. If you open your eyes a bit earlier, it can lead to sleep paralysis. Some find them scary but honestly, they're amusing.

I just had my first WILD experience on accident, and it involved no sleep paralysis, no hours of waiting while resisting the urge to move or swallow, and only a wee bit of sleep loss. It also gave me my longest ever lucid, with about 8 false awakenings in it!

Now, I will tell you what I did. I've been setting multiple alarms on my phone to wake me up every hour-and-a-half for a better chance of lucidity. The alarm is a ringtone that starts out softly and gets louder, so it doesn't startle me awake. The thing is, I'm an incredibly deep sleeper, and can sleep through my phone blaring at full volume for hours on end. Anyways, most alarms only wake me up once I've already completed the bulk of my sleep. That's what happened this morning,

Now I set 6 alarms. One at 12:30, one at 2:00, 3:30, 5:00, 6:30, and at 8:00. I slept through EVERY SINGLE ONE and woke up at 8:15ish with my phone flipping out. This is much earlier than I would have woken up naturally, so the alarms did serve some purpose, although not the intended one. Anyways, at 8:15, I woke up, pissed, and smacked my phone until the first alarm turned off. I drifted back to the brink of sleep, and the next one went off (they are set to repeat every minute, and I have 6 of them). This happened until I turned off the 6th alarm. Looking back, the same effect could be easily replicated by setting one alarm and pressing snooze each time, but hey, whatever works is great!

These alarms had kept me on the brink of sleep for 6 minutes. I laid down after the sixth utterly exhausted, and knew I'd fall asleep in seconds. I remembered reading a WILD method where you RC every 30 seconds ""just in case you're dreaming"", so I tried an RC just for the hell of it. I guess I had fallen asleep within about ten seconds, because the RC didn't check out: I could breathe with my nose pinched shut! I had a lucid dream that lasted about 2 minutes by my estimate, and was pretty damn cool.

The weirdest part was that I didn't know I'd fallen asleep. I saw blackness with no change in it, just like when my eyes were closed normally. Only when I did an RC with what was apparently my dream body did my dream start to take shape. I thought it was super cool that I WILD'd, because I can't even enter SP when I try the ""normal"" way.

Here's a step-by-step method of recreating what I did. I call it ""Mump's WILD"".  :D

1. Set an alarm that will wake you a few hours earlier than usual. The point here is to be incredibly tired when you wake up, so that you can drift back to sleep within seconds.

2. Make sure your alarm has a very short snooze (1 or 2 minutes max) so that when you wake up, you can press snooze and drift into early sleep or the edges of sleep.

3. Let the alarm rouse you for a few repetitions, and make sure to press snooze each time. After about 6 times (this number can probably vary greatly, but 6 worked for me), end the alarm instead of pressing snooze.

4. Now that you can sleep, do it. You will hopefully be tired enough to drift off within a few seconds.

5. This is the most important part. Do an RC after a short while. I know you won't think you're asleep, but neither did I. I did the nose-pinch RC, and I'd recommend it highly. It is the king of RCs.

6. If it works, you have just WILD'd without trying to get into SP! Congratulations!

I really hope this will work for some of you guys out there. I know how disappointing it is when a guide promises success and yields nothing. I can't promise success; I'm just trying to help based on what I've learned. I will be happy to answer any questions you guys have, although I consider myself a nub at lucid dreaming. Also, please please please pleeeeeeeeeeeeeease let me know if this works for any of you! Any type of feedback would be appreciated greatly!

Good luck to all of you! Keep dreaming!

Edit 1- I forgot to tell you, but don't actually count out 30 second before you RC, or 6 alarms. Just RC after a while and let a few alarms ring. You don't want to wake yourself up too much, and counting wakes up your brain and prevents drifting off. Don't think about anything, really. 

Edit 2- I also realize that many (if not all) of the ideas used in this method were not first thought of by myself, and I do not claim originality or take credit for them.

DEILD works!,inrev18,129,18,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/utjtc/awesome_30_minute_lucid_dream_deild_works/,"So I was woken up by my dog barking this morning about 2 hours before I normally wake up. I lay there pretty upset because I was having a cool dream, but I knew I was still tired so I closed my eyes and started thinking about that previous dream. Suddenly, I'm there! 

I couldn't believe it but knew I had to stay calm, so I focused on my surroundings and went up to a wall and dragged my palm across it; it felt incredibly real. It turned out to be a 30 minute LD and I had sex, levitated objects, flew around, fought a lion, and threw glass candles at people :)

This is the longest LD I've ever had and I'm super excited. I think it's my first DEILD (Dream Exit Induced) too. If I had to teach you guys anything, I guess just try waking yourself up about 1-2 hours before you normally wake up with a gentle alarm. Do a quick dream recall while laying there but do this subtly, you want to remain in that half conscious state. Once you remember your last dream, think about the setting as you begin to fall asleep and you should end up in that dream! Worked like a charm for me, I will definitely be testing this out again tonight.

Thanks for reading and happy LDing!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**UPDATE:** I got thinking and wanted to discuss this a little more. Just so everyone knows, for the past few weeks I've been attempting the WBTB method. I would set my alarm for about 5-6 hours after falling asleep and it would go off and I would do my routine but still nothing happened after several weeks. 

Last night I fell asleep at about 1am and my dog barking woke me up at about 10am (2 hours before I normally wake up). That is 9 hours after falling asleep; a significant jump from the 5-6 hours recommended. So if you sleep for a long time like myself, you might try setting your alarm for 8-9 hours after falling asleep. I think before when I was attempting the WBTB, I was still too tired after the 5-6 hours. But with this 8-9 hours method, I am just rested enough so that I won't fall back into a deep sleep, but I'm still tired enough to fall asleep. This combo = lucid dream!

Adjust according to how long you sleep. 8-9 hours fits my sleeping schedule, but for others it might be different. So I think the golden number for anyone is to wake up 1-2 hours before you normally do and attempt a DEILD from there.

I was standing in front of a set of shelves filled with odds and ends and various clutter. One of the things I glanced at in my search was a small, silver pencil sharpener, like the kind that typically comes with a set of sketching pencils.

Most nights I was just lay there uncomfortable and frustrated. However, last night I actually entered SP for the first time by changing my routine. Hopefully this might help you a bit.


Part of my problem was expecting to enter SP by only remaining still. I thought it was the swallowing or the eye movement that was holding me back. What really worked for me was just letting myself fall asleep as I would normally; if I felt too uncomfortable to sleep, I just rolled over. If I had to swallow, I did. This allowed me to actually relax and let my mind wonder into stranger thoughts and fantasies as you normally would before falling asleep. I reached a point where I was completely still, comfortable and relaxed without any effort.


**EDIT:** I should add that it's a great idea to get out of bed after waking up, especially if you're having trouble staying awake during WILD. Just stay awake long enough until your mind is a bit more alert and your body is still sleepy.


To stay aware, I just counted each breath down from 100 (something I read on Dreamviews I think).

I decided to pay attention to one of the person's voices, and almost instantly it transitioned from a thought into something I was actually hearing! Right after that I felt myself enter SP. Unfortunately, that was as far as I got.

so the other day I asked a friend what he knows about lucid dreaming. He wasn't even aware, that there is something like conscious dreaming. As I told him about it, that I have them everyday and never realized that it's something special, he just shook his head and meant conscious dreaming is total bullshit.

He doesn't believe me, instead he is mocking me for making up things. 
Also, he told me that he is never aware of dreaming and forgets his dreams as soon as he wakes up. He believes, that I'm just dreaming that I'm able to control my dreams but in real, as he said, I'm being controlled by my brain.

I know that it's hard to prove but is there a way to convince him that LD's are real?",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_104twb,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/104twb/my_friend_doesnt_believe_lds_are_real/,

I then focused on the space inside the circle until it turned pure white (like the paint of the dream was no longer on the canvas).

1358639292.0,108,self.LucidDreaming,16wgpi,My personal tutorial/experience with lucid dreaming.,PendulumSweep,130,22,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/16wgpi/my_personal_tutorialexperience_with_lucid_dreaming/,"Good day everyone, this is my first post ever to reddit and I thought I'd share my own personal tutorial for lucid dreaming.  Everyone tends to have their own experiences and way of developing their first experience lucid dreaming, but this is how I went about it.  Also I know there are people here far more experienced and detailed than me, so I apologize if I'm repeating anything.  I don't pretend I invented anything, just my experience.

Groundwork: The biggest issue for me in the beginning was making sure I could instantly recognize what was dream vs. reality.  There are a couple ways to go about this.  The first that I used was fairly simple.  I would find a quiet room (bathroom works) and just say this sentence out loud: ""This is my dream and I can control it"".  After a couple of days of saying this 3-4 times per day, I started remembering the phrase in my dreams.  This by itself lead to my very first lucid dream.  Another commonly used practice that you've probably seen by a casual Google search is keeping a dream journal.  Within a couple minutes of waking up, simply write down what you can remember from the dream.  Later in the day re-read the journal.  This forces your mind to start distinguishing the dream from reality.

Your first lucid dream: Try to have it in your mind ahead of time what you are going to try to experience in your first lucid dream.  Most people (myself included) choose flight.  Another thing I tried early on was telekinesis.  I would stick my hand out towards any object and attempt to will it to come to me.  The purpose of having this in your mind is I found the first time I actually acted upon a lucid dream opened the flood gates to much more lucid dreaming.  Having something simple like this to try leads to the next step in my lucid dreaming path, totems.

Totem: I stole the word from the movie Inception but a lot of people who lucid dream have some sort of ""totem"" or whatever you want to call it.  Basically it is anything that you can consistently and reliably test that can ONLY happen in dreams.  My personal test is the ability to make an object come to my hand.  Once or twice a day while awake, I would try to make a shampoo bottle or a piece of paper come towards my hand.  I began to remember to do this same test in my dreams.  I know definitively that I won't develop telekinesis in real life. so if it works I must be dreaming.  Practice makes perfect to the point that now as soon as I'm in a dream the first thing I do is attempt telekinesis.  Conceptually I don't recommend following Inception literally as the concept of having an object appear on your person in a dream is extremely unreliable.

Those are the basics for me.  If this generates interest I have a lot more tutorial-style concepts for lucid dreaming.  I have techniques for developing the ability of flight, telekinesis, how to control the general story of a dream, how to keep yourself in the dream as opposed to being pulled out of it, and I'm sure some others I can't think of.  I want to make one thing clear also: lucid dreaming is as unique as the individuals who learn it.  You may use all, some, or none of what I wrote.

If this generates any interest I'm more than happy to share more with everyone here.  Thanks to all who read the whole thing.

If for some reason you've got absolutely no time then keep reading onwards. Don't worry this post isn't going anywhere you can come back after reading the link above.

Basically what the 50 day MILD challenge is practising MILD for 50 days. Yes that is it :)

 **ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY MANY PEOPLE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL WITH LUCID DREAMING IS THAT THEY ARE NOT CONSISTENT. WITH THIS CHALLENGE YOU WILL BE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE ONWARDS TO THE WORLD OF LUCID DREAMING**  

If ye already read [the link](http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/mnemonic-induction-of-lucid-dreams.html) you can skip this part....

**WHAT IS MILD?**

The MILD technique is going to train your self awareness, making it easier to recognize when you are dreaming. It also involves affirmations and programming for your next dream to contain pre-determined dream triggers to prompt lucidity.

&gt;""As you may already be aware, a mnemonic is any learning technique that aids memory. In this instance, you are planting a cue in your subconscious mind which helps you remember your intention to lucid dream and recognize when you're dreaming.""

&gt;""The following Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams tutorial is aimed at beginners - there are no special requirements or skills needed. It's sectioned in four parts:

Dream Recall
Reality Checks
Lucid Affirmations
Visualize Your Dream""

According to the website

 STEP 1: Dream Journal

STEP 2: Reality Checks

STEP 3: 

&gt;""Repeat one or many of the following affirmations in your mind:

Next time I'm dreaming, I will remember I'm dreaming

The next scene will be a dream

I will have a lucid dream tonight

I'm dreaming now""

STEP 4:

&gt;Now we can begin the visualizations; this is my favorite part of Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dreams. But only perform this step once you are deeply relaxed and feel you could drop off to sleep quite easily.

Although you are just day dreaming (and this is by no means a lucid dream) continue to experience an imagined lucid dream fantasy. Do whatever you would do if this were a real lucid dream. You might decide to fly and explore the landscape, or seek out a dream character.


During this process, you will likely fall asleep. That's ok. The primary purpose of Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams is to have your very last thought before you go to sleep be about lucid dreaming. Mission accomplished! Later the same night (or in the morning) you have a much higher chance of becoming spontaneously lucid.""

**TIP**: Try using WBTB with **Edit:** MILD

FUCK the human brain is unbelievably weird and interesting. I had no idea it was this easy.

EDIT: I remember more! I can't believe I remember more, I never remember anything resembling dreams!

My arms were disappearing into TV static and pixels, just floating away into the bed while my mind's eye (literally, kind of) shot straight upwards. I also remember looking inwards at one point; I was listening to an hour-long recording of a jungle (Yeah, no fucking way THAT helped in any way), hearing the different animals making their mating calls. But I was watching and listening from inside my own lungs, and the slow vibrations of my bronchial trees in their air-sacs (aw nasty) was synced with these crescendoes and decrescendos in pitch coming from all these birds, and then the sound of my inhales and exhales was actually the sound of the tide, in and out, in and out.

Once I brought myself back to full consciousness, I stood up and found that not only were my eyes still heavy, but still in (lesser) REM, and when I closed them and let them move by themselves, I actually felt my balance waver as my limbs felt fuzzy again.

And that was accidental, long before I found this community. That said, I'm making pretty good progress: I now have near-perfect dream recall and it's all thanks to r/luciddreaming. I'd like to share some of my discoveries and realizations since I began this journey.

1. **Take care of yourself**. This can't be stressed enough. I think this comes before anything else. Before you start journals or anything new, make sure you're in good shape. If your mattress is old and uncomfortable, now is the perfect opportunity to get a replacement. Make sure your room feels great to sleep in. Make sure it gets sufficiently dark at night - get a sleeping mask or thicker curtains if necessary. This is important because darkness helps your body produce [melatonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin), which will relax you and put you into the right state. Regular meditation will also help you increase your melatonin levels. Get a regular sleeping routine set up. We spend *a third of our lives asleep*, so trust me, even if you're not interested in lucid dreaming, these things will make you feel more refreshed and ready to take on whatever the day throws at you.

2. **Positive thinking**. Keep telling yourself that this is going to work out and be awesome. Some people are lucky and start lucid dreaming in just a few days. Others, like me, take months - it doesn't matter. Just stick at it. Soon enough, you'll start seeing results.

3. **Dream Journal**. Get one. Once you start getting going, it just becomes a part of your routine like teeth brushing. I have two dream journals: the first (and preferred) is physical: a black notebook that rests under my pillow. I keep a pen nearby and write what I remember from my dreams immediately when I wake up. On the other hand, if I'm too tired to write, and it's the middle of the night, I use [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com) from my phone, which is neat because it syncs with my computer. There are plenty of other note taking apps and ways of doing this. Look around, do some research and find what works best for you.

4. **Think about dreaming all the time and do some reality checks!** This is also important as it is the foundation stone of the MILD technique. [I've had my own struggles with this](http://redd.it/saoi8), and it stems from me not actually using these checks to effectively question my reality. *Don't make the same mistake*. There are lots of wallpapers posted here, and whilst they're useful I think we need to move beyond just having 'Are you dreaming' on a nice background. More effective would be a wallpaper that really forces you to think each time you see it. I've made a couple prototypes [right here](http://www.mediafire.com/?y6n36w5n4ocez2e), but I'd be interested to see who can take this idea further and help our community usher in the *new era of reality check wallpapers* ;). On the topic of dreams in general, there are loads of materials out there to help you keep your mind on dreaming, the [wikibook in the sidebar](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lucid_Dreaming) has helped me a lot. Once again, find what's best for you, and ask the community if you need help.

5. **Stay clear of scary stories**. This links closely with point #2 actually. You need to feel confident and secure in yourself. There's a lot of fear-mongering online - and at times even in this subreddit regarding sleep paralysis etc. Personally, I think it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. I was heavily put off trying out WILD for a long time, just because I thought the apocalypse would spawn in my head. It's really not like that. The important thing to remember is that if you go into WILD expecting to see blood sucking monsters, shadows and other freakishly horrifying things, that's pretty much what you're going to see. I have never experienced these (and I now attempt a WILD every night), for a few reasons. The first is positive attitude, the second is that I set myself a task like counting, which takes my attention and thirdly, when the room spins too much for comfort, I simply close my eyes. 

6. **Diet**. Personal experience: *bananas are good*. Green Tea also seems to help me to relax and concentrate during the WILD technique. That said it contains caffeine, so it's probably a bad idea for most people. Fruit and vegetables contain loads of nutrients which will aid your sleep, so be certain you eat enough. Make sure to look out for foodstuffs containing Vitamin B6 in particular. Like in Point #1, just generally take care of yourself.

7. I really could go on, but I'm eager to hop into bed and attempt WILDing again and also wary of boring you to death with a wall of text - so my final point is **ENJOY THE PROCESS**. This whole thing is a ride, a journey. Don't treat it like a chore, let it become part of your life. Have fun, and you should start reaping the rewards, be it improved dream recollection, or full blown madcap adventures with your flying pet donkey, it's up to you. **Go forth and lucid dreamify!**

The sidebar has a wealth of information, but navigating that is hard for someone who wants to get started today.

I propose that once a month for the next 12 months, I will post ideas on how to improve lucidity, awareness, and dream recall. 

For February:

* Write in your dream journal every day. If there are no dreams, write that you did not recall any dreams and try to create a dream you want. Theoretically, doing this task will increase your attention to detail, and you should have a higher dream recall.

* Before going to sleep, stare idly at your hands. As you do say, ""Tonight, when I am dreaming, I will see my hands in my dreams and realize I am dreaming."" When you are too tired to continue staring, lie down and visualize your hands. This does a few things: staring at your hands and a mantra will create a method similar to MILDing. You are commanding your consciousness to summon your hands in your dream. For Robert Waggoner, who cobbled this method, his hands appeared in his dreams and slapped him in the face. The visualizing your hands as you sleep will increase your visualization abilities.

In conjunction with these exercises, I want to create a list of tasks to do in your dreams. Feel free to post your own, and I will add to it:

* Create a tornado in your dream. Step inside of it and spin. Imagine the scenery changing as you spin. Where are you now? Completed by: [[1]](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/oqbut/february_lucid_dreaming_task/c3jgskr)

* Ask the dream to show you something substantially important. What does it show you? Completed by: [[1]](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/oqbut/february_lucid_dreaming_task/c3jgskr)

EDIT 1: [opatut](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/oqbut/february_lucid_dreaming_task/c3jgd7k) pointed out that in his link to [Mastering the Art of Lucid Dreaming](http://ompldr.org/vYjRwNA), there is an excellent Dream Journal Template.

IT ROCKED!,Tsahcomplice,148,49,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/15b7nf/had_my_first_successful_lucid_dream_it_rocked/,"Before I start this off, this was a looong dream. I had it during my last sleep cycle of the night, and it felt like an entire month had passed by the end of it. 

Just so you can visualize this, my girlfriend and I are both female and in our late teens.

My dream started off with me playing in a band full of saxophones. (I play alto in real life) My girlfriend was the only one in the audience, and I was playing her our song, Blue Moon by Frank Sinatra as I got up off my chair and went down to her. I got down on one knee and proposed to her, and she said yes. It was then that I realized that something was off. I mean, we've only been dating for a little under a year, and we're both far too young to make a commitment like this.

I looked around the room and realized the people playing the instruments were people I knew who couldn't carry a tune to save their lives. I grabbed my girlfriend (let's call her...Derpette) by the shoulders and told her ""Derpette, we're in a dream right now! This is so cool! Are you having the same dream as I am?"" originally she said yes, but then I pointed out that her having the same dream as me is most likely impossible, and we both agreed that it was only my dream we were stuck in.

I rushed her out into the parking lot to my car. I remembered someone posting something on here about always fucking up their lucidity by forgetting they were dreaming, so I apologized to Derpette and told her that I would be humming the same thing ""I'm dreaaaaming, I'm dreaming right noooow!"" for the entire duration of the dream. She understood and gave me a smile and a kiss. I noticed it was raining out so I waved my hand and made it sunny. I held on to her hand for fear she would disappear and helped her into the car. I can't drive for shit in real life, but I made it so that driving the car was as easy as driving a car in a video game like GTA or Saints Row. 

I wanted to get us somewhere cool, so I decided that we would have a grand adventure that would eventually take us to a beautiful building next to a river that I went to in the summer. On the way there:
I met up with my grandparents (one of which has passed away), met up with my best friend on a European style train (changed the weather to sunny while on the train as well), and commented on how odd it was that cars on the highway were driving off a cliff for no reason, to which Derpette replied ""They need to keep their feet on the gas."" as if it was common knowledge. 

When we got to the building, we infiltrated the base underneath and took the largest diamond in the world (with the [Peter Gunn Theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK-b5PLhrEI) playing in the background). Whenever someone tried to shoot at us I'd make them fly into the wall with a flick of my wrist. 

We went upstairs and found out that the building was actually a really fancy rehab facility for drug addicts. Someone I knew who was a recovering meth addict was there and I paid him $5 to let us use his room for an hour. (keep in mind i'm still singing ""This is all a dreaaaaam"") 

I remembered reading somewhere that you could talk to your subconscious if you tried calling yourself on the phone. I tried to take my phone out of my pocket and a bunch of socks came flying out, much like a [trick can of snakes](http://www.spencersonline.com/images/spencers/products/interactivezoom/processed/00941203.interactive.a.jpg). The second time I tried, I actually got my cellphone out and called my own number on speed dial. This was probably the coolest and creepiest part of my dream. 

The person on the other line sounded like a pre-recorded voice of a woman. Kind of like those robotic telemarketers, not like Microsoft Sam, but pre-recorded none the less. This was our conversation:

* Subconscious: Yes
* Me: Hey... Is this my subconscious? 
* S: Yes
* Me: Uh... Okay, what do I even ask you?
* S: (silence)
* Me to Derpette: What do I ask it? 
* D: Why are you asking me? I'm just a projection made by you, after all.
* Me: Good point. (Back to the phone) Tell me, why do I have depression? Why am I so depressed all the time?""

This time when it spoke, it sounded like a pre-recorded tape of myself speaking to another person in an emotional manner.

* ""Because I have no girlfriend.""
* Me: Bullshit, I have a girlfriend. Stop being a troll and tell me the real reason! 
* S: Fine. (Censored because of privacy. Subconscious did follow through though.)

After that I hung up and looked at Derpette. I was feeling pretty down, and I just wanted to wake up so I could see the real Derpette in real life and give her a hug. I could hear FBI agents banging on the door to our room demanding we give back the diamond. I realized that since I was still dreaming (still singing by the way) I could do whatever the fuck I wanted, literally. So I turned time back by an hour and we were back to before I used my cellphone. 

I told Derpette that we had about an hour of dream time before I had to wake up, and I told her that I wanted to have as much fun as possible. So I snapped my fingers and turned on the boom box that was conveniently there. I started singing in Barry White's voice and we both laughed really hard. I thanked her for the great time we had and opened my eyes in real life.

Thank you to the kind people of this subreddit. Without all of the information I've gotten here, I never would have known what I had the potential to do in my first lucid dream! I hope I can continue to dream and learn, and I wish you all the best :D

It was a dream within a lucid dream within a dream.

Okay so here's the dream. I started out in a regular dream.

I was in Grand Central Station wondering around. There weren't many people there, but I felt a feeling of hostility. I'm looking around and I see the balloon people with horrifying faces limping towards me. I get kinda freaked out, but more angry at them. I start this epic battle with the demon balloons and end up killing them.

After I killed them I appeared in the side yard of one of my old houses. Wondering how I got there I look around. When I look into the backyard, I see the demon balloon people walking around in it. Then it clicks. I say to myself, ""Hey that's not right, I killed them! OH MY GOD I'M LUCID RIGHT NOW!"" I stand there in amazement until I see the balloon people walking my way. Then I close my eyes and yell ""BEGONE DEMONS"" and they dissipated. I felt so powerful. I look around and see I'm in my backyard at the house I live in now, I'm assuming because I closed my eyes. Now I'm just running in circles yelling, ""OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD! I'M FREAKING LUCID! I have to write this down in my dream journal and tell everyone! Oh wait! I should fly!"" So I jump into the air and assume the arms out in front flying pose and lift off. I get about 30 feet in the air and then I start to feel myself losing lucidity. I tried to focus, but I could feel my consciousness falling back down to the ground eventually fading. 

The next thing I could remember I woke up in my bed and I was running to tell my parents that I just had a lucid dream. They got annoyed that I did. Then told me to go the fuck to school. I told them, ""No I'm going back to sleep so I can lucid dream again!"". Then I ran back to bed and laid back down and closed my eyes.

Once I did that, I woke up to my mom waking me up telling me to get ready for school.

I am absolutely in love with LD and practice regularly.

A couple of days ago i read on this subreddit about Calea Zacatechichi, and became quite intrigued. I bought some online and yesterday it arrived.

I rolled a joint with only calea in it and brewed a cup of tea with two teaspoons of calea and had them both in succession just before bed.

Right, the joint burnt nicely and i had no issues with it. But the tea on the other hand. MY GOD! The tea was the most vile thing i have ever experienced in my life. I don't honestly think i can describe how horrid it was. To illustrate i would like you to imagine, biting in to a lime peel and washing it down with the most bitter warm badger urine u can find. It wasn't the best thing i have ever tasted in my life to say the least. It was so bad, that i put a teabag in my brew and diluted it with actual tea to no avail. I then poured some concentrated fruit juice and decided to down it regardless. That didn't work either and i almost vommed. In the end i just drank a sip now and again and finished it slowly. 

So after this I thought, i better have another LD after this self-inflicted torture. I even went to bed at 22pm and set an alarm to wake up after 6 hours to perform a WBTB MILD/WILD.

Unfortunately, i didn't have a lucid dream. But i can say, that my dreams seemed very real. They were very detailed. Almost life like. I remember a scene in my dream were i was stepping out of a car and being greeted by my cousins. I remember all the colours of everything, everything was fluid, nothing strange about the dream at all and right now if it wasnt for the fact that it was written in my dream journal i could mistake that for a memory rather than a dream. Awesome stuff really.

**TL;DR? I bought it, smoked and drank it (tea was brutal), didn't have a lucid dream, but had very realistic dreams all night.**

So, this is what i am going to do tonight. There is absolutely no way in hell that i am going to brew another cuppa. I'm going to roll another joint and ingest it instead this time. I'm going to continue with my WBTB WILD&amp;MILD after 6 hours of sleep to see if i can't stumble across a RC whilst dreaming realistically.

And wow, this experience is truly amazing I must say.  The dream started out in my house at night, and for some reason at the VERY beginning of my dream, I said to myself ""This is a dream."" and at first it meant nothing, no change, no feeling of lucidity. After realizing what I said, it went something along the lines of ""Wait, this IS a Drea-AAHHHHHHH HOLY SHIT!"" 

It felt like my mind was being purged of everything bad, and almost nirvana-like.  I had to keep the dream from getting fuzzy, so I closed my eyes, rubbed my hands and turned around. When I opened them, everything was stable.  It was going perfectly!  I tried immediately to fly, but failed.  I turned around, placed my contents of my pockets onto the kitchen counter, and I found not one, but TWO remotes in my right pocket, very much like [this](http://images.thoughtsmedia.com/zt/2007/zune-dock-altec-lansing-jd-002.jpg).

I only took one with me, which may have caused me to not be able to fly maybe?  Anyways, I took a look, and several different buttons, However I only was able to try two buttons.  There were two 'Up and Down' buttons like [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__qaQfpFMAUE/TK_ZbgYXLyI/AAAAAAAAAU4/GiiCMEOSCDM/s1600/Elevator+1.jpg) except the horizontal lines were not there, so it was a two-sided triangle:  (/\) (/\). &lt;- Like this.

So, naturally, I thought the 'Up' arrow would allow me to fly. Nope.  It made me scale up. Bigger, Taller, Stronger, etc.  I stayed the same proportions, but got larger everytime I used the button.  Now when I was pressing the button, I had stepped outside first, and tried to change the environment from winter to summer. It worked(sort of). I waved my hand, and only 1/4th of what I saw that instant became summer, and the rest winter.   ""Oh, well."" I thought, and went back inside to check the time, surely enough the clock was very random. It first read ""9:59"" Then ""2:18"" after I blinked.

After using the buttons, each time I would walk slower, but get larger, so I tried the button next to it, which coincidentally made me run faster ever so slightly.  Some kid that was walking on the street wanted to have a race, so I agreed. I won, by I have no idea how many miles.

That's all I can remember for the first part.

The second part, I can only remember I was in a party, with a girl that goes to school with me, I'll call her Lexi for now.  Lexi was wearing a vibrant blue dress.  I thought ""I'm going to fuck her, since this is a dream."" I for some reason was repelled from doing it, and had no want to, even though I was sure I wanted to.  I took her by the hand, and a voice(sounded the same as mine) said ""If you dream too long, a guard like the guy from TRON will come get you, and you better stop dreaming...or bad things will happen."" I had taken Lexi by the hand to go a flight of stairs, determined to bang her.  At this point halfway up the first flight, I woke up.  I awoke at 5:59, one minute before my first alarm is set. I only remember those two events, but I know there was more.  Dream recall will come I suppose.

**TL;DR:** I realized It was a dream, mind felt purged of everything bad, found two remotes, got larger in size, fan faster, tried to bang super-hot chick, failed(I don't know why), and woke up.

I cannot stress this enough. All jokes aside, if you could only do ONE thing for your lucid dreaming practice, make it a dream journal. 
Dream recall is the most important component in becoming lucid. If you can't remember your dreams there is little chance you will became aware of them while they are still going on.

Write down your dreams every morning, recorded them in an audio recorder or in a smartphone app, paint them if you damn well want to, just record them in some fashion. 

If you do this consistently (for a long enough time) you will even naturally start lucid dreaming. But if you do it for even a short amount of time and supplement that with *any* lucid dreaming techniques, and you increase your chances tremendously. 

But so often, reading about and trying out many techniques at once becomes overwhelming and you end up unsuccessful. Start simple. Do one thing. Record Your Dreams.

Sweet &amp; Lucid Dreams...

We were leaning over one of those display counters with the glass on the top and front with sliding doors in the back. He showed me a design I hated. The tattoo was a mermaid. I rejected the first design, asked for a different artist to draw it, and named a specific style for it to be redone in. So the artist goes away to redraw, I take the thing from the case, pretended to get a phone call and ran outside to hide whatever it was I took, and hid it against the building in the landscaping. When I come back, the original artist tries to put a small fish tattoo on my forearm but I yell at him to stop because I already have a tattoo in that spot (that I don't have in real life) that says ""shrimp"". I leave without getting the tattoo, and while walk out, I look through a giant picture window in the shop and see the outline of a nesting doll (a symbol I've worked with and thought about a lot in my art) in masking tape on the window.

This is pure recall, since I do not believe I was lucid at all in the dream.

Now the problem is that in my daily life, I've consciously begun thinking ""oh fuck, I really have to find that thing."" This drive has become more persistent, and I have had zero success LDing or even having decent recall since.

I recently (a few months ago) began the quest to start Lucid Dreaming. I started with reality checks, MILD, WILD, everything. For months nothing happened, I had no signs I would ever have a Lucid Dream.

But once I did, it was like a switch was flipped. My constant RC's and concentration paid off. Now, I have a Lucid Dream around once a week, and they are some of the most fun I've ever had.  

My most recent LD involved me realizing I was dreaming while in my yard. I decided I wanted it to be winter, and nighttime, so I changed it. Then I went for a jog (I love running while in a LD, because it feels so effortless). I spotted a car in the oncoming lane, so I decided to stand in front of it and attempt jumping over it, which I did to great success considering I was above the treeline after my jump. There's something about the adrenaline rush you get from feeling as though you're in mortal danger, even though you know it's not real, that's just fantastic. Even though I knew the car couldn't hurt me, it looked and felt like a car was hurtling toward me as I stood my ground.

Seriously, it is worth it. All the work may feel like a hassle, and you'll probably get discouraged (I know I did) but the payoff is fantastic. I have seen some fantastically beautiful things in my dreams. If you have the willpower to think it, you can do it. 

So keep at it! It'll be worth it in the end, even if it is just one time.

I used to go on /r/NoFap from time to time, and learnt how it can negatively affect your life. I also had trouble going several days without it, so it was useless. But now, fapping is my reward. It seems weird, but I'll either come out of this in a few weeks having broken my fapping habit, or had many lucid dreams.

This puts your mental floor 90 degrees from the actual floor and under your feet. This kind of separates me from the physical world even before I start to completely relax and seems to make the transition to dreaming easier. 

When I was a kid (in waking life), I'd completely relax, take a deep breath and slowly dive into our pool. It was about three meters deep and sometimes we kept it at hot-tub temperature in the off-season. Once under water, I'd allow myself to spin a bit and get upside down to lose my orientation. I'd just float like that as long as I could hold my breath (which was a pretty long time, since I was in good shape and completely relaxed). It was incredible. Once I began needing O2, I'd blow a few bubbles out of my mouth and follow them to the top.

I do the same thing when I am first relaxing into a WILD, I allow myself to float around until my physical orientation is gone, then just observe what happens until a dream coalesces around me.

Needless to say, I had a miraculous time. Also, I find that spinning in circles works best in order to maintain lucidity. But the reason I post is not to relay my experience. I was reading just a little while ago on WILD and came across a section about 'visualizing your dream environment.' The author commented on how difficult this can be and I thought, ""it's not difficult at all for gamers."" What I mean is that for us, maps and gaming environments are burned into our subconscious for GOOD. I must have at least 30 maps memorized from playing COD in the past (mind you I don't play anymore). So in essence, this could really help with WILD once you accomplish sleep paralysis (easier said than done, I know). It may even help to stabilize your dream environment since it's so familiar.

It was easily ten times better than what other first-hand experiences say about it. Although I only flew around my house and peed for ten minutes in the dream, it was completely exhilarating, and I'm flabbergasted that LDing has not become a worldwide phenomenon yet. Amazing.
**What worked for me**
Everything that anyone has said about going to bed, sleeping for 4-6 hours, waking up, then going back to sleep **is entirely true**, at least for me. Last night I went to bed attempting to WILD, fell asleep accidentally, woke up at 6, went back to bed, then BOOM. In the dream, I remember seeing myself on my bed and thinking, ""this is weird, this shouldn't be happening"". I then counted my fingers, which is my regular RC whenever I check the time, and I magically had six. It wasn't blurry at all, there were just six fingers there, and I immediately knew I was lucid. Surprisingly, I didn't need to make myself calm down at all, I was just automatically immediately overcome with an extremely wave of calmness and complete awareness. Lucidity can best be described as how your waking life feels if every sense you have was Macho Man Randy Savage-ized. Vividness and intenseness to the extreme. So, I peed for ten minutes. I almost lost lucidity while peeing but I remembered rubbing my hands together, and that brought me back. That completely works. Whenever you feel as though you are  losing your lucidity, definitely do that. I also concentrated very hard on keeping this atmosphere. I think both of those combined kept my mind focused, my body asleep, and my dreams lucid. So I flew around for a bit and woke up with a huge smile on my face and of course, made a facebook status.
**What did NOT work for me**Since I'm a noob, I wasn't surprised that WILD never worked. I would lay in bed and count upwards from one, thinking ""I am dreaming"" between my breaths, and would feel my hands go numb and bright lights flashing beneath my eyelids. Just when I feel like I'm about to hit the next stage of WILD (around the number 250 or so), my mind would go wild and my breathing would freak out. I couldn't keep myself calm knowing I was about to enter a lucid dream and I would lose my focus and become aware of my surroundings again. This was extremely frustrating and I would say to not try WILDing unless you have had at least a couple lucid dreams, just so you know what to expect when it happens. Also, LDing came completely natural. Both times I've had a lucid dream, it's been when I wasn't 100% attempting to; they just happened. Although I've been trying since the beginning of May, this has been the most rewarding experience of my life. Don't give up or think lucid dreaming will never come to you.... it will.

I proceeded to find and fornicate with a few people I've always wanted to.. It seemed to last a few hours of just messing around. I briefly thought of bringing up my subconcious, then thought.. ""No.. that is level 10.. you are just passing level 2.""

i've been noticing that when i'm sleeping in (which is every day lately), i'll enter a state that fluctuates in between dreaming and merely experiencing hypnagogic imagery/thoughts. at one end of the spectrum, i'm fully dreaming. at the other end, i'm kind of just lying there in bed, with the narrative of the dream playing in my thought loop, something like ""and now, he goes left, into the store, and he talks to the guy"" and the imagery of the dream playing in my mind's eye. in between, i'll get into a state where my eyes are closed and the dream is happening, but at the same time, i can feel the position of my body and everything in my bed, and i get the sense that i could just open up my eyes and walk away and end the dream.

when i'm in this state, it's obviously really easy to go lucid, but it feels really lame. it almost feels like i'm just imagining things, if that makes sense. i try to limit myself to just telling my dream character ""alright, just walk over here, now go there"", but i can easily get ahead of myself and cheat and sort of skip steps, if that makes sense. like if i'm trying to walk my dream character along a hallway, i can just imagine him at the end of the hallway, and it'll work, but the ""dream"" (more like a mental image at this point) will feel really fragile and after struggling to maintain it for a while, it'll inevitable fall apart in a minute or two and i'll be forced to wake up. 

has anyone else experienced this? is it possible to transition from this state into a full, vivid, lucid dream? 

also, quick anecdote. this morning i was half-dreaming somewhere on the deeper end of the spectrum, and i was having a dream where my friends and i were at bonnaroo on the last day. we all remembered that on the first day, kanye west had given a special private performance to only us and maybe ten other people. but we had been doing so many drugs that everything seemed surreal and three days ago seemed like a distant memory. i was debating with my friends whether or not it had actually happened, or if it was some sort of shared hallucination, because it just seemed too crazy that something like that would actually occur. we even went around asking event staff if they had heard of kanye doing a private show that weekend. all this time there was a part of me that knew that i could just open my eyes and end all this. but it was only until i actually got out of bed and stretched that i said to myself ""oh, that makes sense, kanye never played for us, it was just a dream, lol."" i feel like i was pitched the slowest of the slowballs right over the plate and i struck out :(

1353452256.0,98,self.LucidDreaming,13j97g,Every lucid dreamer should learn DEILD (Dream-Exit Induced Lucid Dream aka Dream Re-entry Technique),CrypticRanger,109,11,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/13j97g/every_lucid_dreamer_should_learn_deild_dreamexit/,"The dream re-entry technique, DEILD, has helped me so much with lucid dreaming, I believe every lucid dreamer should know how to do this technique. I have gotten many lucid dreams from it and use it when I want to extend my lucid dreaming time for the night if I wake prematurely. I use DEILD when I'm waking up from an already lucid dream that I cannot save by stabilizing or if I wake up from a normal dream and I'm still in a semi-sleeping state where I'm aware enough to do the technique. I have used this technique 4-5 times in one night to have many lucid dreams in one night.


DEILD (Dream-Exit Induced Lucid Dream) is a technique that you do when you are exiting (waking) from a dream. It is also know as the dream re-entry technique because you basically wake up and re-enter the dream. It usually only takes a few seconds to go from awake to back to lucid dreaming, so this technique can be done quickly and easily. This technique is especially good to learn if you wake up easily and often.

The dream could be a lucid dream that you accidentally woke up from or a normal dream that you woke up from and have yet to move your body. DEILD is like a WILD that you have woke up into. By that, I mean that your body is on the verge of entering sleep paralysis or has already entered it. 

If you move, you either messed up your chance at using the technique at that moment (you can try again if you wake up again) or it could take a little longer to re-enter the dream because your body knows you are awake enough to move and have to start the sleep paralysis timer over.


**Here's how I use the technique:**

When I'm waking from a lucid dream, I stop moving and try to keep myself aware of the fact that I am waking up and not to move once I start feeling my real body. When I feel myself in my bed again, I do not move and remind myself that I'm going to be re-entering the dream so I won't accidentally fall into a non-lucid dream.

I then imagine where I want to be or be doing when I re-enter the dream. I imagine myself running because the imagined sensation of running to a realistic feeling of running is a big indicator for me that I have successfully entered the dream. I imagine the feeling of my arms swinging, my feet hitting the ground with each step, the wind blowing in my face, and the sensation of moving forward. All these imagined physical feelings suddenly transforms into your dream body feeling and doing the actions.

You can imagine a place as well. I sometimes imagine a forest, but if I don't, I usually end up somewhere random. When imagining a place, I imagine what it would feel like to be in that place. Say I want to be in a dream forest, I imagine the smell of pine trees, the sound of leaves rustling, and the feeling of a light mist and a cool breeze. I usually combine all these senses into imagining myself running through a forest. One second, I'm imagining myself running in a forest and the next I'm actually running in a forest. Imagining an action isn't required to do DEILD, but I believe it really helps tell you when you are in the dream.

While you are imagining, your body should be entering sleep paralysis. DEILD usually takes less than a minute for me, so you shouldn't be laying there too long. For me, the sensation is like my body is becoming stone and that I'm sinking into my bed from my feet to my head. While my body is sinking, it feels like my body is disappearing. This is where the imagined sensations come in. Sometimes, you won't notice yourself entering the dream, one second you are imagining, the next you are in the dream. It is important to keep focused on the fact that you will be dreaming very soon and to keep an eye out on when you start feeling your dream body. Sometimes, you will know immediately when you are in the dream. One time I was focusing heavily on visuals and from the darkness, everything that I was imagining flew at me and every sensation hit me at once; was probably one of the most vivid moments I've had in a lucid dream.

Once you successfully enter the dream, do a reality check if you must (I do one because it helps me cement the fact that I'm dreaming into my mind) and **STABILIZE**. Stabilizing the dream is very important in a DEILD because you have just entered the dream, you can easily lose it again if you don't cement yourself into it. If you don't stabilize, you can either wake up again, have a very hazy lucid dream, or the dream can become non-lucid. I usually stabilize by rubbing my hands together and focusing on the sensation. I also survey my surroundings and focus on tiny details. I take up to 5-10 seconds to stabilize so I can make sure the dream is as vivid as I like and that I won't wake up as soon as I start doing stuff. Remember to stabilize when you feel you are losing the dream again or if the dream starts losing vividness.

You can do this technique many times in one night. Be aware that your recall will suffer from this if you use it too many times in one night and you might have difficulty remembering dreams from earlier that night. If you aren't sleepy enough after waking, DEILD may not work.


**== TL:DR ==**

DEILD stands for Dream Exit Induced Lucid Dream, also known as the dream re-entry technique and can be used to re-enter a dream after waking from normal and lucid dreams. This technique usually only lasts a few seconds to a minute. When waking, do not move. You can imagine yourself doing an action, such as running, or a place, such as a forest. Imagining can help indicate when you have entered the dream successfully, but it is not required. You will enter sleep paralysis and the imagined sensations (if you imagined any) will become realistic and you will enter the dream quickly. Do a reality check and **STABILIZE**. Use this technique as many times as you want in one night at your own risk because it can affect how well you recall dreams from earlier that night. 

That should be about it, but here are a few links of DEILD tutorials:

I tend to go through patches where I want to and other patches where I prefer to enjoy my dreams and the good dream recall I have aquired from lucid dreaming.

I have not seen anyone mention Calea Zacatechichi in this sub so I thought I would take the liberty. Also known as Mexican Dream Herb, calea has an amazing ability to induce lucid dreams as well as intense and vivid regular dreams. Sometimes too vivid. I spent several months using it packed into gel caps. Tea was too bitter. Recently though it has started to appear in tincture form.

I had many amazing experiences on it but eventually stopped using it regularly due to the fact that I started waking up more tired than I was before going to bed. While sleeping on calea your dreams can become so vivid and real that they can exhaust you. I can honestly say that I occasionally I woke up having experienced the kind of time scales they talk about in INCEPTION, (this was long before the movie was even in production).

Another tool I found useful was Salvia tincture. I would take a few drops of salvia tincture just before going to sleep and found that I gained lucidity almost every time. I decided to try using Salvia as a lucidity/dream inducer as I had read in a psychedelics encyclopedia (Possibly the one by Hoffman) that traditional users would make a salvia pouch and keep it in their cheek until they achieved a visionary state. I also found that salvia while sleeping is not as unpleasant as salvia while awake.

Has anyone else tried Calea or Salvia for inducing lucid dreams?

TL;DR: Mexican dream herb is some interesting stuff.

HELP?,lucid_throwaway159,120,25,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1fs0g0/i_think_i_fell_in_love_during_a_lucid_dream_its/,"I feel like I'm losing it. I was hoping if some dreamers here could help me figure this shit out.


About 17 months ago, I got inspired by this subreddit and decided to lucid dream. For the first 5 months, I had trouble getting it down. Suffered through some sleep paralyses, but I finally managed to control my dream a bit. Sort of.


First, it was AMAZING. I was sincerely surprised at how vivid everything looked. I was at my university campus, sitting outside by the class I usually waited for. I did a reality check with my fingers and immediately realized ""I must be dreaming."" I did the whole stabilizing tricks, like where you rub your hands together and whatnot, and just kind of chilled for a while. Then I spotted a face out of the crowd. Let's call him ""Tom."" He was a friend of a friend, and I barely spoke to him before. He was pretty good looking though, so why the hell not? I decided we should hang out.


We chatted over lunch (although I can't remember us actually eating) then hung out at his place. It feels like we spent forever talking because we had so much in common. We shared similar views on life, liked astronomy, cooking, video games, etc. I knew he was pretty good at video games in ""real life,"" so fuck it, we're playing video games together.

He was better at starcraft than I was, so he even taught me how to play better and gave me tips. What baffles me to this day is how clear everything seemed while he was explaining things to me. I could still ""hear"" some of those tips. I don't know. We hung out, baked together, went to the movies, and had a real good time.

Then I think I kind of lost my lucidity, but then I never considered to stop and check. I woke up really fucking terrified, immediately realizing that the guy I hung out with didn't actually exist. Then Tom walks into the room, a Dr. Pepper in hand, asking ""What's wrong, babe?"" and I find myself sitting on his bed in his dorm room. **Why did it feel like I knew this guy for months?** For some reason, I felt really relaxed, and everything felt completely normal. It wasn't weird that I was sleeping over at this dude's place. It wasn't weird that he called me ""babe."" The dream went on like everything was normal, then I woke up for real.


I felt that complete sense of dread again, like I lost something so fucking special. I don't know how to even describe the feeling. I ended up crying for a good 20-30 minutes, which is strange because I haven't cried in years.

All those bits of the dreams were really fragmented and distant time-wise in my head, as if all those happened on separate occasions and I've known Tom for **months**. Never once in the dream did we call each other our girlfriend/boyfriend, but it felt like a real relationship.

This dream happened a year ago, but I still think about Tom every. single. day. I don't even try to lucid dream anymore, but I sometimes dream about him, especially on nights when I go to bed stressed. In addition, I see Tom every few months or so in the ""real world"" because we have mutual friends. Let's call real-life Tom, Thomas. When we hang out at our mutual friend's apartment, he sometimes talks about video games and stuff, and I can't help but think ""Tom and I used to talk like this."" What gets me most is when he casually goes to the fridge and grabs a Dr. Pepper. Fuck. That was Tom's favorite soda. What's even more ridiculous is that I didn't even know Thomas drank soda, let alone Dr. Pepper, before I met Tom.


My psychiatrist (who I see for reasons unrelated to that lucid dream) asked me about my relationship history. He specifically asked me if there was anyone I was strung up on or couldn't get over, so I told him that there was a guy I ""met"" a year ago and couldn't stop thinking about since...except I didn't mention that he wasn't FUCKING real because my psychiatrist was already questioning me for schizophrenia (which I know I don't have; I also see a psychologist).


So fuck, /r/luciddreaming . What the fuck do I do? Should I go back trying to lucid dream him out or something?


**TL;DR:** Lucid dreamed about a guy and I think I fell in love with him. One year later, still can't stop thinking/dreaming about him.

We all took shrooms and hiked and played for hours. I was thinking about how everything felt like a dream the entire time and was happy because I was sensing all the things you're supposed to in All Day Awareness. The entire time, I was thinking about how the texture of everything varied and payed close attention to the colors and to how it felt to breathe and couldn't stop feeling things and listening to the sounds they made. I had a feeling I would LD that night simply because I was thinking about my shroom trip and how the sensory effects of it would apply to LD-ing.

I got home and ate and then went straight to bed, which was around 12PM. I woke up at about 3:30AM for some reason, so I turned off my alarm set for 4:30AM, when I would have woken up and recorded my dream. I passed out again and then went into an extremely vivid and prolonged dream, that stayed vivid the entire time. I didn't have to spin or do anything to keep the clarity up. I woke up at 8:30AM and forgot to record it immediately, and then I showered and made breakfast and called my girlfriend. After I was done with all of that, it was like 11AM and I decided I should record my dream. It still felt and feels vivid as when I just woke up.

Magic Mushrooms really enhanced my ability to pay attention to the things going on around me. I think it took my ability in ADA to a higher level, and the concept of it makes so much more sense now even after my trip has ended. I think that even if magic mushrooms didn't directly cause my lucid dream, they gave me the ability to analyze and pay critical attention to my surroundings, which makes LD-ing easier to do.

Edit: **nsfw** because of the subject of a drug
___________________________________________________________________________________________
For anyone who cares - here is what my dream was. I apologize that it's not the best written dream.
    I was in some sort of Zombie safe haven community - it seemed like a jail though, but with freedoms to walk around.I remember being in a room, seemed like a small grocery store converted into a town meeting center. There was some sort of movie playing, it was a retro cartoon movie in black and white that had a really nice soundtrack. There were 4 rows of wooden chairs, each row had about 8 chairs in it, and so there were 32 people watching this movie. I was in the second row, about the middle - and I noticed Geddy Lee was sitting in front of me and he had his bass. I asked him if he’d play his bass along to the movie soundtrack and he did. Then he turned around and said something about how this movie really made him feel things he hadn’t in a long time, and he was crying.
Then I walked to a different building in the town. It was a really dingy locker room. When I walked in, I really had to poop so I asked to use a toilet, a small black kid, probably about 8 years old, led me to a stall and opened it. The front ⅓ of the toilet was missing and it had black mold all over it. I decided I’d just go outside. I walked down the aisle that the stalls were in until I came to little cubicles being used as shelters, They were probably 5x5 cubicles, and they just had a curtain for privacy. A giant black kid, who was probably my age, came out of one and I couldn’t stop staring at him because he was like 7ft tall and had a really warped face. His eyes were big and bulgy, they were very far apart and slanted upwards. His mouth was very small and his nose was big. He had a very skinny frame, and his traps seemed to come up to his ears on his thin shoulders. Then his father came out, who looked exactly like him, but a foot taller. He was lecturing his son about intimidating some kid - saying “He has to be scared of you, he thinks you ain’t scary.” Or something along those lines. 
Then I was outside of that building, walking down a path that was by the fence surrounding the place. It was very woodsy - there was a ton of folliage on the ground that was wet and rotting. The sky was grey and there were evergreens in patches throughout the place. I walked on this path for a while and then somehow I was in a building with 2 people. The building was like a cabin, but a cabin that was normal width, but extended back unusually long. The front room was trashed, and there was a glass window wall, with a wooden door, that led to the next room. The next room was about 5 feet deeper than the first room, so you had to walk down steps to get into it. It was flooded and had sand dunes in it that you could walk on to avoid being wet. This room was massive. It would have been…something like 50x120x20 (wlh). Once again, there was another glass wall with a wooden door on it that led to the next room. My party noticed that there was a zombie in the next room, so I decided we should lay down and pretend we were dead. The zombie hobled into the room, it took a while to get the door open, but it came into the room we were in and was making horrendous noises and I could hear its blood dripping on the puddles of water as it walked over the sand dunes towards me. I remember thinking that it was stupid I was laying down, but that it was okay because I was dreaming and nothing could actually hurt me. It stood over me and muttered and groaned for a while, and then walked past me and just vanished? I got up and walked into the next room. The two people I was with were no longer with me when I went into the next room. This room was actually a courtyard when I walked into it. There were no walls or anything, I could see the sky - looking back, it was very surreal to walk into what looked like a room in a house, and for it to open up into a courtyard. This courtyard had the walls of the safe haven town bordering two sides of it. It suggested a square shape rather than defined it. The courtyard was all gravel, with grass peaking through it and it had some shallow pits of water. I was walking to the wall that was across the courtyard in front of me, when zombies started ambushing me. Some came from the puddles and some just appeared. There was one I remember that looked like a male nurse who had been bitten and was dead for a while, because his flesh looked waterlogged. They were all running at me and I couldn’t run much faster than them, so they were all very close. I made it to the wall and jumped up to the top and got back into the town (because the cabin had taken me outside the walls.) The zombies climbed over the red brick walls too, and I started running way faster because I thought that if I could just get past other people then the zombies would be preoccupied with them rather than continue chasing after me. I was right, and the town went into panic, and pretty soon half of the people I saw were zombies looking for food and the other half were people running around screaming. Nothing was coming after me, so I just watched the chaos.

Keep in mind that there are diffrent ways to lucid dreaming and diffrent types work on diffrent people. Some people might master this technique in a week, other in months. In a worst case scenario you will atleast be able to remember your dreams more clearly.

Be sure to do this every night for a week atleast. Practice means perfection and it's not like riding a bike, you need to maintain this practice if you want to work.

-

Note: Make sure you are relaxed before going to bed. Don't go straight from your computor or video games to your bed. Read a book, turn everything off, have a cup of tea. Also while repeating this technique be sure to go to bed at the same time every night to keep your body in a steady rythm.

-

Step 1: Make sure everything is quiet around you before you sleep. Turn off radio/TV/computor, make sure no one walks around. Close the door in case you got pets, etc.

Step 2: Go to bed and sleep in a position you feel comfortable in.

Step 3: Breath in a calm manner. Try image you become more heavier every time you exhale until your body becomes so relaxed as if it feels like it's going numb. You can also focus on those tiny movements and flickering dots on the inside of your eylids.

Step 4: Repeat step 3 until you get a ""signal"". Some people get the feeling that the are afloat, some people say they feel a faint electrical current flowing through the skin. 
Yours will be personal and you will notice. Once you get the feeling it is now time to ""leave your body"".

Step 5: Focus hard on the feeling of your mind leaving your body. Imagine you would raise and sit up in your bed, all in your head ofcourse.
NOTE!: Some people find this last transition frightening. Kind of walking through a dark forest at night, there is nothing to be afraid of though it may only look dark and creepy. It's all in your head but if you want to cancel at this point then awake your body slowly.
(I myself got a scary feeling the first times aswell but eventually i overcome it and successfully got into the dream.)

Step 6: Should you succeed in step 5 then you should find yourself in a dream. The place you would most likely find yourself in first should be your bedroom since that was the last image the brain remembered before falling asleep thus projecting.
If you are unsure, do some reality checking. If you are in complete controle of your dream then congratulations. GL HF!

Side note: Your lucid dream should last for about 4-6 hours before you enter deep sleep or if you get interrupted or awaken. You will not succeed the first nights doing this.

Its only one lucid dream so far but its a huge start!

Im 20 weeks pregnant, and every night for... well the entire pregnancy Ive been having ridiculous nightmares. Ive woken up and written a few down, and even my big tough SO is freaked by them. Hence my being petrified to sleep :-(

I joined this sub looking for ANYthing to help. I saw several posts about looking at the time, so the last few weeks every night as I fell asleep as pictures began to move, I consciously looked at a clock I now keep on my imaginary closed eye world and tell myself outloud in my subconscious ""Im ready.""

Last night I finally achieved lucidity and just in time :-)

Very pregnant, a packed bag in one hand, a streaknife in the other, I was in the middle of a bloody zombie attack. My two friends and I were surrounded and being overpowered. We knew we couldnt touch the blood or get bitten or we would become one of them.

With my steaknife I managed to actually saw the head off a few zombies, as decapitation seemed to always work in the movies. But this time it didnt. We knew we had to somehow smash what was left of their brain as well, or they would keep coming.

I managed to yank the brain out of a recently severed zombie head, I remember being all pissed at the inconvenience of only having a steaknife as a weapon. I smacked the brain on the table in front of me and proceeded to angrily and violently smash it and chop it up with my knife.

My friend ran in the room, freaking out when she saw I was handling the gore with my bare hands. She wept as she informed me that if zombie brain even touches our skin you immediately begin to change. That would explain my rage.

Tears in my eyes I noticed it was getting dark and looked at the clock on the wall. SUDDENLY I KNEW I WAS DREAMING. 

I looked down at the mutated brain in front of me searching for a solution. I remembered that if I imagined something as a possibility to go wrong it would. I meeded facts. First fact I told myself: if a zombie brain touches yor skin you dont slowly change. Scientists just proved it immediately sucks out all endorphans from yor brain in attempt to stay alive, while replacing the missing endorphans wih dopamine. This sudden feeling of utter depression and despair is too much for most to handle so they take on the essance of a zombie, giving up all hope, thus putting themselves in more dangerous positions that they are actually bitten and become one.

I smiled, but immediately began to feel the effects of this chemical transfer. Being lucid and now fully aware of the situation I was in, I began to fight the urge to give up even more. I looked at the steaknife in my hand, and got angry at my dream self for not being more prepared. I walked over to the cupboard and pulled out a machete.

Then my alarm clock went off and I woke up.

Thank you again for helping me turn around my first nightmare. Im almost excited to face the next one! :-)

1. At night when feeling very tired, set your alarm for 4.5 hours and fall sleep quickly.

2. When the alarm goes off, get up for about 15-20 minutes. Eat something healthy, like fresh fruit, or make some tea.

3. While awake, obsess over lucid dreaming. Imagine yourself falling back asleep, back into a dream and realizing you are dreaming.

4. Now go back to sleep for real, and focus on your intent.

Good luck! It works for me a lot. I think the reason is simply that you haven't yet hit your good REM activity at that time of night, and by momentarily waking your brain up, the focus on lucidity carries over when you quickly go back into REM. Also, waking up in the middle of your sleep cycle keeps your mind very relaxed and free of any stress.

In the midst of that dream, I did a reality check by plugging my nose and breathing in. What do you know, air came into my lungs! I immediately think, ""Holy shit, I'm dreaming!

Upon waking up, I get ready for school, and because I've been telling anyone and everyone about my attempts at lucid dreaming, when I get to school I'm raging to the entire student body about my failure of a lucid experience--AND THEN I WAKE UP AGAIN.

This time I'm ACTUALLY awake. And again, I'm raging to anyone who'll lend an ear. But because nobody's interested/knows anything about lucid dreaming, I've gotten little to no help. I honestly have no idea whether I actually experienced a lucid dream, or I was dreaming about being lucid. So I guess, I'm looking to know whether I was actually lucid or not. Ironically enough, the part of the dream that feels the haziest is the ""lucid"" part.

You could do this in a journal, notepad, word processor, really anything that can hold text. It is best to document a dream within minutes of waking up, because it is easy to forget something vague if your brain is concentrating on what you're going to eat for breakfast.

Step two: Set up a reality check. A reality check is literally making sure if you are in reality or the dream world. This must become a habit if you are to easily tell if you're dreaming or not. A really simple one that usually works for me is looking at your hands as if examining them after a manicure. In the dream world, you fingers can rarely keep their normal shape due to the high processing of thoughts going on, the brain can't focus on that one thing. Some more suggestions for RCs are: poking a finger through your palm, walking through mirrors (don't try this in your actual home to save embarrassment!), attempting to fly etc.

The movie Inception is not a good base for RCs, because in your dreams you will not always have a specific item, so generally try to work with what you know you will have.

I just woke up from two successful lucid dreams. This is my third lucid dream (been practicing for months) and I'd like to share what worked for me last night. Hopefully you'll find this helpful!

-Before sleep: Think/read about lucid dreaming nightly. Just having it in your brain and think about it before you sleep. Very much like MILD, but you need to BELIEVE that you will become lucid. Not so much, ""I hope I become lucid tonight!"" but more so, ""I will become lucid tonight."" I have both ""Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming"" and ""LucidAbility,"" courtesy of some Reddittors and have been reading them nightly.

-When in the dream: Rubbing your arms/hands. I've felt myself slip away on some occasion and rubbing my arms (as if I was cold) helped me feel that I was still there. It them helped me notice details that I haven't noticed before (like the grains in the concrete sidewalk) and helped me refocus on the dream. I basically walked around 75% of my dream either rubbing my hands or my arms.

-When I woke up, I didn't bother with a reality check (I know! My bad!), but instead I kept still, didn't move or open my eyes and tried to go back to sleep. I quickly entered SP (I could feel my body just go limp) and entered into the same dream within minutes, also lucid.

In 10 years, I had maybe 100 epics like these, and here they come one after another for days. 
  
 I love the new intensity, and it even produced a few spontaneous lucid dreams with increased control. Here are the two things that I think are responsible:

* I started exercising - cardio and weights
* I started drinking protein shake with milk every day

I can trace the origin of vividness to these two events, most likely the new amino acids in the shake, but have a few more changes going on:

* I walk in a park for 90 minutes each day for 20 days
* I have not played a video game in 20 days
* started watching Netflix instead 12 days
* dramatically reduced porn and masturbation
* eating more salads and chewing food better
* I use orange lightbulb starting at 10pm and wear blue blocking glasses (30 days)
* still take melatonin supplements 2.5 mg before bed

I thought ""calm down, its a dream"" and bit my lip to check. It wasn't a dream.

I though ""calm down, sleep paralysis, they say its scary,that would explain the thumping at the foot of your bed and in the hall, and the tapping, calm down and you'll go lucid. I tried to move my fingers and toes from the safety of my blanket, they both moved, with ease.

Finally, terrifyed and utterly defeated, I thought ""well, I guess this is the end, I have had a pretty descent run"" and said thank you to everyone and everything in my life that made it good silently (reddit was definetily on there) and I thought ""If there is a murderer waiting for me when I awake, I am ready to die"" And slowly opened my eyes (MUCH calmer than earlier by now), expecting the end. Noone was there, I searched my room, noone but me.

I couldn't sleep after this, so I got up (7:00 am) and got ready for the day, with for some reason, mild chest pains in the first hour.

So for those of you who don't know what the ""shadow"" is, it's one of Carl Jung's ""archetypes of the collective unconscious."" An archetype is a psychological component innate in every human being. It's the psychic counterpart to our instincts, which are primarily physical. He postulated that there were a number of archetypes that are universal to the human species, including  the most recognizable ones: the anima, the shadow, and the hero. [The shadow is basically that aspect of your personality that is  unconscious and tends to be negative. Those parts of you that you don't wish to embody consciously (maybe because your society does not condone such behavior) and thus repress.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes) You unknowingly project these things onto other people if you don't consciously accept them. Confronting these archetypes is part of Jung's process of individuation, in which one's personality-development completely rounds out. Worth reading about. So, I started looking for my shadow in my lucid dreams. 

In the first dream wherein I think I met my shadow, it refused to talk to me. I asked if it was my shadow and it repeated what I said, mockingly. It looked like me, and every time I tried to confront it, it ran. I think it did this because I wasn't really nice to it either and saw it as a bad thing. I said ""HEY! Are you my shadow?"" kind of in a shitty way.

The second dream, I approach this coffin, and I'm absolutely terrified of what's in it. I know my shadow is in there, but I have no idea what it might be or what it might do. As soon as I hesitantly take a step forward to open it, the door swings open. This woman jumps out and lands on top of me and realllly awesome sex commences. That's about it. I guess that was last summer.

Well, last night, I met my shadow for the second/third time. I wasn't as afraid this time, but had some weird adrenaline-y emotion. I was more brave this time around, less hesitant. I saw this hooded figure that I was terrified of, but decided to approach nonetheless. As soon as I took that step forward signifying I would confront it, it revealed its face: a terrifying dark cloud of voices which reminded me of that black thing in the elevator in ""Scrooge""

THIS IS WHAT YOU WISH YOU WERE NOT

THIS IS WHAT YOU DENY ABOUT YOURSELF

I AM WHAT YOU'RE ASHAMED OF

THIS IS TRUTH

And abunch of sentences along those lines being shouted simultaneously. It was horrifying but exhilarating. All of this happened in a very short period of time, we'll say two to three seconds-- then it ran away. Some time later I saw the top of its hood again through a window and I went back. This time when it revealed itself, it turned into a beautiful woman (but this particular woman that I deny that I'm attracted to. I'm a senior in college and deny being attracted to freshmen, even though they are pretty much indistinguishable. It wasn't her, but reminded me of her.)

We preceded to have the *greatest* sex for the rest of the dream. Every detail was there. It was actually better than any waking sex I've had. 

Why is my shadow having sex with me? It's making the move, not me. Has anyone else met their shadow? What happened?

TLDR: I'm having sex with my archetypes

EDIT : This bears repeating (credit to Spncrgmn)

-As a supplementary note to what OP said, please bear in mind that of the archetypes that might be encountered in a dream, they are not necessarily the shadow, and the shadow itself might not be easily identifiable to those who have not studied Jung extensively.

Succeeded on some of the previous tasks? Some new tasks will be given to you, right after the repost from the creator *Oneireus*, for the people who will see this for the first time.


**Repost of the first thread:**


For 2012 (to early 2013), I think this subreddit should focus on honing our abilities as well as providing a guideline for anyone who wants to become lucid in one area. The sidebar has a wealth of information, but navigating that is hard for someone who wants to get started today. I propose that once a month for the next 12 months, I will post ideas on how to improve lucidity, awareness, and dream recall. And give ""tasks"" to train your skills.


**Repost End**


**This Month's Golden Tip :**
*Many people will get really excited after realising their dreaming. This is a pretty normal thing, but it can cause you to lose lucidity or even let you wake up. One of the things to avoid this is to do an RC and take a deep breath. Ofcourse you can celebrate it after realising, but try to calm down and focus on the RC.*

**This Month's Tasks:**

* Control the weather. Create a tornado, make it rain etc.

* Create a landscape from /r/ImaginaryLandscapes. It has some beautiful landscapes, perfect for your dreams (/r/Earthporn is also a good one)

* Change into an animal! Fly with wings, swim in the oceans as a dolphin, run fast as a cheetah etc.


**This Month's Master Task:**

The skills a master has is to have full control of your dream and have the possibility to summon landscapes and huge buildings in one second. You dont need to do this one if you know you cant. but you can ofcourse always try! 
I always try with the Master task to combine the three master points:

* summoning big things like landscapes and/or buildings


* control DC's


* And test the ability to stay lucid for a long period

This Month's Master task is to reconstruct a Space fight. You need to:


* Create some huge HQ ships. Maybe some asteroids, or planets.

* Let hundreds of little ships fight each other and let them fight you.

* Fight on one side and destroy the HQ ships

Good luck with everything and feel free to give suggestions for other tasks and to post your succes or failure down below. 
The ones who succeeded the Master task will be named next month!

Usually when people are asked this question, they come up with amazing answers. Yet whenever I become lucid, all I do is fuck some chick or fly over a random city. I am given the powers of a God, and that's all I can think of? Seriously?

I was watching the Matrix Revolution tonight, and at some point in the movie, Neo fights against Agent Smith again. If you remember, that fight feels weird; like they were in a dream (which is pretty much  what's happening really), and they fly against each other with all of their seemingly infinite power, only to bump into each other and resume fist-fighting while falling down to earth. They both seem invincible and omnipotent, and keep on fighting hopelessly.

So I thought, **could I create an enemy so powerful that even *I* couldn't beat them in my own subconscious?** [Could God create a rock so heavy that even He cannot lift it?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence_paradox)

Next time, this needs to be tried. And if I can beat my own undefeatable creation, then I will truely be a God in the universe of my subconscious, and I'll create a whole new civilization.

I had an epic lucid dream last night that I thought some of you might like to read about. The dream started with me in my friends apartment (which I visit quite often). What tipped me off to the fact that it was a dream was that when I went outside, his apartment complex was on the wrong side of the street. Once I realised I was dreaming I decided to take control. Lately I have really been interested in boxing, so much so that I have decided to begin a regiment. Naturally, the first thing I thought once I took control was that it might be fun to have an epic boxing match; and who better to fight than myself? So I concentrated on replicating myself in the dream and lo and behold, there I was, standing right in front of me. My opponent was very eager to begin the fight so we didn't waste any time. The best part was we couldn't feel pain so we were throwing each other into cars and buildings and generally having a godlike battle. It was one of the coolest dreams I've ever had.

In regular non-lucid dreaming, our attention is constantly being trapped by each thing that appears, just as in waking life our attention is constantly being trapped by each thought or emotion that appears.

Getting lucid starts by become aware, and becoming aware starts by paying attention to how are we reacting to all these ""things"".

Sometimes we think we are absolutely aware of the enviroment just because we're focusing our eyes into external things, without realizing that we're perceiving everything through the glasses of the mind...

Attention is a tricky subject: you can stare intently into something, but paying attention to something without realizing which glasses you have put on, means you are asleep.

The moment you start watching your own mind silently, the moment you notice your glasses and feel your real eyes underneath, then you become aware (even for a few seconds).

We want to learn lucid dreaming, but in order to do so, we need to learn to be as lucid as we can during the whole day.

Once in lucid dreaming, when you keep staring at a single object, you'll get sucked up by it and either wake up or ""wake up"" in another dream. That's why once lucid, in order to be able to solidify and control the dream, one has to learn to glance into things in a subtle and detached manner so that no object absorbs us.

Curiously, this same principle is what allows us to become lucid in the first place. By not letting things (objects, thoughts, emotions) absorb us, we can properly check our reality and stay aware.

Lucidity is the art of detachment.

You can start your journal, you can read and think and talk all day about lucid dreaming, you can try the techniques, the apps, the binaural beats, whatever... All that helps, but the real deal is that you won't make real progress until you start training that feeling of detached perception. That's what ""checking reality"" truly is; getting out of the box, detaching yourself from your usual conditioning and identity, and then observing the present moment as it really is.

How do we start? By paying silent and sustained attention (specially to your ""self"") during the day... How do they call that? ...Meditation.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,1367769843.0,,,True,t3_1ave2o,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1ave2o/detachment_meditation_and_lucid_dreaming/,

I've been working to remember my dreams more, and have been writing them down when I do. I can usually tell when I transition from one dream to another, or even remember how many dreams I had even if I can't remember all the content.

Occasionally (more frequently lately) while dreaming I'll have a sort of background awareness that I am dreaming, and exert some minor influence on my dreams, but time and time again I get this sensation (while dreaming) of being like ""nah man, don't mess with it, just see what happens!""

Sometimes I'll wake up and if the conclusion wasn't satisfactory or what I desired I'll think ""aw man, I should have exerted more influence and tried to transition into lucidity"" but it almost seems like I am subconsciously avoiding doing so.

The strangest part is I'm not totally certain whether I mind or not. On the one hand I would really like to be more lucid in my dreams - I've never flown before, exerted a lot of control over erotic dreams, or practiced a skill I want to work on. On the other hand I have just enough awareness during these dreams that it's almost like a combination of watching a movie and playing a video game (controlled experience with limited influence), and can be really enjoyable just to sit back and let it unfold.

To counter this I began to study other people's ideas of ""power"", I did this by watching lots of [X-Men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_%28TV_series%29), in short it worked I went from not being able to leave the atmosphere without waking up to being able to visit the surface of the sun at will. I also recently had a dream I was morphing between different types of weather uncontrollably a feeling I can barely describe as it was so abstract.

It was a journey inside my subconscious and it toyed with the very fabric of what I believe is memory or dream. Some of you might think it's just creative writing, but I assure you this happened to me and it affected me in a way I don't think I'll ever forget. 

In my dream, though most of it is very foggy now that I’m awake, I remember the entire process of meeting and courting a woman. She had beautiful blonde hair, breathtaking eyes and a contagious smile and the feeling her face evoked is honestly the only thing that remains etched in my mind. I remember brief moments in time of us together, in the mall, with friends, sharing intimate moments, visiting faraway places and countries I’m sure don’t exist. We were so in love and perfectly happy. I remember a feeling of absolute bliss. I’m actually crying as I write this now because the emotions are still there. I had all these memories as clear as if it was a full life actually lived.

Then, inevitably as every dream does, this one had to come to an end. But it was like we both knew it had to be over. We hunched down against a wall, I can’t remember where or why, and I told her I was waking up. She nodded and just held me and I started to cry so hard because I knew I was going to lose her. I held her so tight because I knew these were our last moments. I could feel myself drifting back into this world, and every single memory we had together of the life we lived was being wrenched from my mind into oblivion. It was like I was losing pieces of my soul, and watching my soulmate vanish in front of me piece by piece. I kissed her as long as I could and held her tight. I started screaming in anguish, tears streaming down my face, and feeling a pain as real as if my closest companion was actually dying before my very eyes. My deafening screams settled into quiet whimpers and I awoke alone and covered in sweat. I still felt the pain though. I felt the absence – something missing. 

But here is where it gets truly bizarre. At some point last night, I went back. I’m not sure if I awoke in this world and then went back to sleep. Or if the dream of my lover had been itself, within a dream.  I say this because in the second part I remember (within the dream), I forced myself to lie down and fall asleep. In this dream I had total control of everything that occurred. It was as if somehow, because I was already asleep, the boundaries of reality no longer applied and I could shape the thoughts and images I saw. In this ‘dream within a dream’ I went back to look for her. Because this dream is so many layers deep, I cannot remember the details of it, but I remember the objective clear as day, to make her real again. I remember thinking of exotic places and they appeared. Dreaming of terrible dragons and creatures and they appeared. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t bring her back. I couldn’t create the image of her because I simply could no longer remember what she looked like. I brought countless women to life before my eyes but none of them were her. 

Then, in frustration and deeply depressed, I awoke. I tossed and turned and had several more short dreams after which I cannot remember, but none so profound. This morning, I awoke and went about my daily activities. But then somehow, it all came back like a tidal wave washing over me. The sadness, the longing for a person that I couldn’t even recreate in my head. I felt again the pain that had brought me screaming back to the surface sometime in the middle of the night. Here, in front of the bathroom mirror, I cried deeply again. 

So, it’s things like this that make me wonder about my subconscious. Make me think about the strange possibilities. Did my subconscious cross paths with another’s last night and fall wildly in love? Did I experience deep, buried memories of a past life? Did I experience a brief shadow of my life in an alternate universe, on a path not taken, before being pulled back into my own? 

I honestly think I will never know, but this was one of the most bizarre and profound emotional experiences I’ve ever had. Being asleep but fully awake, and being within a dream with the power to shape my own reality. Mind-boggling...

I know one thing though. There’s still a tiny part of me that hopes, despite my inherent skepticism, that maybe someday, somewhere, I’ll see her again on the street or in a dream, and even though we have never spoken, both of us will know.

I landed, went into a forward bend and then instead of just my hands touching the ground I was able to pull my chest all the way down, while still standing on my feet and simultaneously go into the bottom of a pushup. It was almost as if there was the experience of two different bodies or one very odd body. I then began to go into other very impossible positions/routines given the structure of the body in waking reality. The odd thing was it was as if I already knew these strange positions, but this was the first time I have ever done yoga in my dream.

Curious about this method, I promised myself that I'd try it that night - **for science**!

Before hitting the sack, I lined up 3 alarms: one at 6:00, the second at 6:10 and the final alarm at 6:15, then slipped my phone under my pillow and fell fast asleep.

Fast forward to 6AM, and the first alarm woke me as planned, as did the second and third. However, I made the fatal mistake of snoozing instead of deactivating the alarm, before throwing it to the foot of my bed and lying back down.

Looking around my room in the morning light, I saw a gargantuan spider clinging to the wall above my door - straining closely I realized it had a hideously disproportionate body and it click inside my brain that it couldn't possibly be real. From there I figured I was in a dream and became lucid. I had done it - hooray!

Just as I was about to take advantage and get creative, and ya' know... do my thing... *Thunk*. I awoke instantly with a throbbing head.

The reason? Having not properly turned off my alarm, it had reactivated waking everyone else in the house up - apart from me for some reason - as a result my bro had come into my room to throw a book at my head for waking him up before 10AM. 

So what have I learned? Well, as far as I can tell, the repeat alarm technique is very powerful - I suppose I've been having brushes with lucidity for months now, so maybe it wouldn't provide quite the same tipping point for beginners, but it worked for me. That said, *make sure you turn that damn alarm off*! Otherwise you could find your dreamland adventures ending a little earlier than expected.

Needless to say, tomorrow morning I will definitely not be making that mistake again :)",,False,,t5_2r0f4,1338125643.0,,,True,t3_u78fc,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/u78fc/simultaneous_fail_and_win_using_the_multialarm/,

Every time this happens, it is the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced. I can't think my way through it; I'm petrified. 

So it's like this. I wake up, in the middle of the night. I'm lying on my back, even if I made a point to fall asleep on my side. Everything is dark, darker than dark. And I can't move. I can't wiggle a toe, breathe, move my arm, blink. Nothing. And there's a figure. 

This figure is darkness personified. I thought everything else was dark? Everything else is noon in Antarctica compared to this- figure. They call it the 'old hag'. And it's sitting on the foot of my bed, or even right on my chest. Lately it's been on my chest more and more often. And it's looking at me. I can't move my head to see but I can FEEL it looking at me. I can't lift my head up to look at it but I just KNOW where it is. 

And I've never been this terrified. I can hear my heart pounding and I want to scream, or strike out, but I can't. I'm paralyzed. 

And then after what's probably only a few seconds but feels like hours I don't want to scream or hit anymore. I want to pull the blanket over my head and cover my eyes like a child. I want to whimper and cry like a baby because darkness personified is on my chest, weighing me down. I am about to die, and I know it.

Sleep paralysis has been happening to me, increasingly more often, since I first tried to lucid dream over a year ago. I don't attempt LD any more because of it. This makes me sad, because I achieved lucidity a few times and it was amazing. I miss it, but I'm too scared that it will make my SP worse to try it again. 

I'm scared to sleep. I cry at night because I'm so terrified of it happening again. I just woke up from one bout of it, and it's almost five am. I would be grateful for any advice. 

Please help me. 

Edit: I don't know if this is relevant, but I also have nightmares relating to helplessness. People that I love in intense pain or dying and not being able to stop it, things like that. They're bad, but not nearly as bad as SP. 

Edit2: Wow, thanks for the amazing responses everyone. You've given me some great tools to deal with this, and excellent advice to deal with the underlying contributing factor of my fear of helplessness, and the memories that caused it. Thank you so much, I think I will sleep better knowing that I can beat this with love and acceptance instead of trying to fight it.  

Edit3: A lot of people are saying that they wish they could get sleep paralysis, to use as a bridge to lucid dreaming. Although I began getting sleep paralysis around the same time I was getting into LD, I've never gone from SP to a lucid dream. And I don't know how I do it. I wish I did, so I could stop it.

Now it's a single sling strap? OK. I take it off and turn around to set it in the back seat. There's a functional DVR on the driver's rear floorboard and old carseat on the passenger's. I put the backpack on the back floorboard and turn back around. Hey, I remember about reading about reality checks last night, what the hell, let's look at my hands -- cool 5 fingers..WAIT, I have six fingers!

As I woke up, I couldn't quit grinning. I realized that even though my lucidity had lasted for about 30 seconds, I was dreaming for what seemed like an hour previous. I can recall what happened in my dream prior to my RC and realizing I was in a dream.

This may make sound a bit fantastic, but I have never tried to have an LD before. I was actually on KickStarter last night browsing and saw the Remee mask. The product piqued my interest in lucid dreaming and the kickstarter page led me to the /r/luciddreaming subreddit. I spent about 1-2 hours browsing and reading. I went outside a couple times during the night before bed to take out the dogs, and out of pure curiosity began performing RCs on my hands. Until last night, you could call me a skeptic. I didn't believe lucid dreaming was possible. Anyway, little bits and pieces stuck with me reading the subreddit and I essentially convinced myself I would have a lucid dream last night.

I'm a bit of a night owl and go to bed around 1 - 2:30 AM. I wake up around 6-7:30 AM. I went to bed and tried WILD, but of course that failed -- I have never done anything like this before. I counted to like 350 and then my son started snoring and my wife started rustling. I gave up and told myself I would try later. I know it will take a while to be able to become lucid sooner and have more control over my dreams, but because of the information shared in this subbreddit, I was able to have my first LD. Thanks!

Anyways so it was dark and I was walking around this neighborhood by myself. I noticed my brother walking around one of the houses so I went up to see what he was doing. He told me he and his friends had just broken into this house and were stealing everything. I went inside with him and just started walking around. There was at least 5 other people inside looting the house. I went upstairs and in the master bedroom where I could see the bed covered in blood. There was a blonde headed woman holding a child and both of them were shot and dead. I went up closer to see if I recognized them. That's when I noticed moving from the other side of the bed. A man with shoulder length hair popped up and hit me with a baseball bat. I fell backwards towards the ground and my brother ran into the room with a knife. I dragged myself and hid behind a dresser. I heard a stabbing sound a few times (the one you hear in movies) so I thought it was okay to come out. When I got up I see the man had stabbed my brother to death and was coming towards me. I have no clue where it came from but all of the sudden there was a gun laying on the ground next to me. I picked it up and shot at him and missed, he started walking towards me. I shot again and missed and he swung and nailed me with the baseball bat again. I was laying there on my back and shot one last time and that's when I got him-right between the eyes. He fell down and I got up and stood over him, watching the blood run from his wound. All of the sudden he reached up and grabbed me. I had to hit him over the head with the gun 3 times until he stopped moving. Right after that I woke up.

After I couldn't remember how I had arrived at the destination or gotten on the bus, I asked my friend if I was dreaming, and of course he assured me that I was NOT dreaming. So I decided to do a reality check and asked the friend when my birthday was. After he answered wrong, I realized that I was dreaming and became lucid. The state of lucidity was filled with many interesting experiences, but soon eventually I felt that I had done enough for that night and that it was time to wake up.But here's where things got weird. I tried to wake up, and experienced several false awakenings, each at a different location. Frustrated, I decided to look for a solution. While walking through a school, one of my old teachers spoke to me as I was passing by and said ""Ah, you're stuck in a dream"". I was astonished and told him yes, and asked what I could do to wake up. He instructed me to find a quiet place to lie down, lay down flat on my back and close my eyes. I said ""Yeah, of course"" as if I had known all along. I did this, and saw my world start to shake and my vision got blurry as if my head was vibrating and everything faded to white. Then I woke up.

Did you succeed on some of the tasks from the previous month? I will be giving you the new ones right after the repost from the creator *Oneireus*, for the people who will see this for the first time.


**Repost of the first thread:**


For 2012 (to early 2013), I think this subreddit should focus on honing our abilities as well as providing a guideline for anyone who wants to become lucid in one area. The sidebar has a wealth of information, but navigating that is hard for someone who wants to get started today. I propose that once a month for the next 12 months, I will post ideas on how to improve lucidity, awareness, and dream recall. And give ""tasks"" to train your skills.


**Repost End**



**This Month's Golden Tip :**


*To increase your summoning skills, begin with small objects. when summoning stuff like a tree you really need to believe you can do it. when there is even a little thought in the back of your head saying that it may not be possible, your brain will take you in the ass and prevent you from summoning it. Another tip is to say to yourself "" when i turn around, there will be a tree"". imagine in your head how the tree will look like while turning.*


**This Month's Tasks:**


* Another ""Explore your dream world"" version: taking a cab. we already know the walk version in wich you just walk and see where you go but with the cab version the dream world will take you to new places. you summon a cab, step in it, wait till the car stops, walk out and enjoy. Ive been to some weird, yet beautiful places by using the Dream cab.


* Suggested by /u/gobazooba i quote: *""Jump through a mirror like a portal or just summon a portal gun.""*


* We know skydiving but what about taking it a little further? Free fall. Falling on a pillow ofcourse.


* Ski from a huge ramp!


**This Month's Master Task:**

The skills a master has isn to have full control of your dream and have the possibility to summon landscapes and huge buildings in one second. You dont need to do this one if you know you cant. but you can ofcourse always try! 
I always try with the Master task to combine the three master points:

* summoning big things like landscapes and/or buildings


* control DC's


* And test the ability to stay lucid for a long period


This month you will go back to a siege in the Middle Ages. you need to:


* Summon a big castle


* Have DC knights around the castle and inside.


* be general of the attacking group and capture the castle. 


Good luck with everything and feel free to give suggestions for other tasks and to post your succes or failure down below. 
The ones who succeeded the Master task will be named next month!

Instead of using a reality check, I used something that only happens to me in dreams as an indicator. I commonly have dreams where a tooth is falling out/crumbling. Google says I feel a lack of control or a fear of rejection. Whatever it is, I've come to realize in the dreams that it wouldn't happen (not like it does anyway) in real life.

A couple of things about the dream. I apparently spawned a black Suburban and drove it to my high school ex's house. It was raining hard, but no lightning. Then I spawned a bike and decided it'd be cool to fly with it. It was very difficult. I couldn't stay upright. Then I tried flying without the bike. The initial liftoff was easy, but every time I lost focus of where I was going and focused on the fact that I was flying, I'd fall. No pain whatsoever though, I thought that was pretty cool.

I also tried the typical ""count your fingers"" reality check several times throughout the dream. It made everything clearer except my fingers themselves. They seemed to fade away just before the middle joints. I could still count the nubs, but sometimes I'd end up with 5, other times I'd end up with 7. Looking at my hand as a whole, I knew there were only 5, and I thought surely I couldn't have miscounted that badly on something so simply. I spent quite some time reassuring myself that I only had 5 fingers per hand before I realized my ex's dog had realized I was floating around their house. The family formed a search party to investigate, as it was the middle of the night, and I panicked and back-stroked away in the air (in real life, that's the easiest way for me to swim). Finally, a barrage of text messages woke me up, and while disappointed that the cool dream had ended, I was still relieved the family never caught up to me.

I was exhausted when I finally climbed into bed after being awake for 24 hours. I browsed through reddit for a little while and came across r/LucidDreaming/ mentioned in a comment. I was curious what lucid dreaming was, so I subscribed to the subreddit. I read a few posts, including the top from all time. I was skeptical. I wanted ask if lucid dreaming was really a for real thing, but I could see that many of you were convinced it was so.

I closed reddit and thought to myself that perhaps this summer I would make a project out of trying to lucid dream. I would go buy a nice notebook to journal in and maybe convince a friend to join me in the effort. I had no thoughts and made no effort to lucid dream as I went to sleep. In fact, my thoughts were specifically set on this being a project I would not start until a later time. 

During the 12 hours that I slept, I experienced a couple few different dream sequences. I will describe the final sequence. It was night. A young woman and I decided to trespass into a very large and vacant warehouse type building where a K-Mart (HUGE store) used to be. Suddenly, we were inside and were both topless or nude. Not sure which, but one of them for sure. From inside, we opened the front door. A car was driving by and we were worried we would be discovered in the building. Confidently, I opened a rain umbrella to cover our faces and upper bodies while we stood still in the doorway. The driver drove on by without seeing us. My plan worked!

We walked out and around the door to where we could see the posted hours of operation for the store. We learned the store would be closed on Sunday (the following day in this dream), so we had plenty of time to be there undisturbed. 

I turned around and discovered the woman was gone. Huh. Where did she go? I thought she may have gone back inside. I tried to get back into the building through the door, but it had closed and locked behind me when I exited. I walked around the building to our original point of entry, a large broken window located inside a laundry room. I found the window was no longer broken. I could not get inside. 

I casually decided to try the ""reality check"" I had read about in a couple of the r/LucidDream/ posts that said one should try to count the fingers on one hand. I lifted my left hand up in front of me and started counting in my head, ""One, twoooaAHHH! I AM DREAMING!!!"" My index and middle fingers were missing! Seeing that and realizing that I was dreaming was INTENSE. I can feel a rush just typing this portion of the story. The fingers just kind of faded into nothing at the points where they were supposed to extend out from my hand.

I was extremely excited and absolutely aware that I was dreaming. I remembered reading about a ""stabilizing technique"" that said one should rub their hands together. I did that. 

I still wanted to find the woman. I thought about trying to materialize some kind of box-shaped tracking device that I could hold in my hands that would show me the woman's location, but no such box appeared. I took a step or two. My field of vision kind of went gray or foggy. Then I blinked and opened my eyes. I wondered if I was opening them in real life. I woke up. BUMMER! I looked over at my clock and saw that I had been sleeping for 12 hours and didn't feel like I needed more. The adventure was over. 

I remain a little bit skeptical that this was a lucid dream and not some kind of coincidence. What I can tell you for sure is that in the dream I was absolutely convinced that I was dreaming and consciously tried to manipulate the dream, but I woke up just seconds later. I am now HIGHLY interested and will be making some serious efforts to lucid dream.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_1c2an0,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1c2an0/i_had_a_lucid_dream_the_first_time_i_slept_after/,
1361034649.0,82,self.LucidDreaming,18n6wo,A faster way of keeping a dream journal than pen and paper without the blinding computer lights - attach an external keyboard to your closed laptop.,eightmilliondonuts,124,42,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/18n6wo/a_faster_way_of_keeping_a_dream_journal_than_pen/,"I've tried many different ways of keeping a dream journal with varying success.  For me, pen and paper is slow and more or less requires turning on the light.  An audio recorder is faster, but at least for me, speaking and listening to my own recorded voice in the early morning is uncomfortable.  Not to mention that reviewing the audio takes a long time, and I would transcribe it anyway.  My favorite method was to keep my laptop by my bed with the trackpad turned off and my text editor up and ready to type into.  This worked fairly well, but still required enough effort to locate and open, not to mention the bright lights that accompanied it, that I would often find myself having not enough motivation in that groggy state to record my dreams in the morning, even if I was remembering them.

So, I needed a stupidly simple solution, and this idea came to me last night and it worked really well:  I attach an external keyboard to my laptop and set that by the bed next to me.  Then all I have to do as soon as I wake up is reach over and grab the keyboard (which is significantly lighter than the laptop) and start typing.  Since I can touch type, I don't have to turn on any lights, and I just keep the laptop lid closed.  If I want to make sure what I wrote is there, I have my laptop brightness turned all the way down and have [flux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) installed.

This method could also be used for keeping a journal of your waking life in a more relaxed position, or if you remember something you don't want to forget as you are falling asleep.  This morning I just kept typing my thoughts about life after I had finished recording my dreams.

Anytime I have sex in a lucid dream I feel like I'm raping them. Like I can't come to terms with the fact that it's a dream and the people aren't real or something. I remember reading something on here one time that sometimes when you have a block in a dream you just have to remind yourself that it's your dream and you can do whatever you want. So I told myself that, but the dream character was still struggling. I told her it was okay, she wasn't real, I was just dreaming and I just wanted to touch her - and I did - but I couldn't escape the feeling that I shouldn't be doing it.

This has happened on many occasions - and notably only seems to happen when I have sex with women. All the guys in my lucid dreams have been willing, and all the women seem to be unwilling.

When I saw everything start to fade I immediately decided to start up a conversation by getting everyone's attention. I yelled out ""HEY! HEY!! BACK ON TOPIC!!"" and immediately all the fading stopped and the world I was in came back. I had to tell myself to stop thinking about the fact that I was lucid and to just go with it.

Just wrote a [guide to dream control for once you get in the LD](http://redd.it/rk8te). Enjoy...

---------------------

So I've been reading topics the past few days and it seems that a lot of people are attempting WILD. A lot of new people are trying too with varying degrees of success and some horror stories for the unlucky. So I thought I should give some advice and other people, feel free to add your advice too. Let's help each other...

**What is WILD**

You are basically trying to trick your brain into believing you are sleeping while you are still holding your consciousness awake. After the brain decides you are in fact asleep it will start dreaming and so you will enter the dream directly keeping your consciousness.

**How to do it**

The basic step of WILD is that you have to get to sleep while keeping your consciousness. People use different incantations or mantras that they repeat to themselves (""Sleeping body - awaken mind"" or something like that), I've heard of people doing math problems in their minds.

**What will happen?**

Your brain will start sending signals to different parts of your body to make sure that they are ""asleep"". In reality this all happens inside your brain. 

Have you ever had that ""falling"" feeling while half asleep? It can be something like that. You MUST NOT move when this happens.

Another common occurrence is a tremor in the legs or arms or a feeling of numbness. This is also normal / don't react.

Heart racing, pressure in the chest, hypnagogic imagery (seeing shapes/lights etc behind your closed eyelids) all normal, DO NOT REACT!

For me the point where I feel that it's almost over is when I start hearing things (test of the ears) and there is something like a bang! followed by a sucking sound... Perfectly normal - carry on - nothing to freak out about...

**Sleep Paralysis**

So you went through all that. Well done you are now legally asleep as far as your brain is concerned. Your body is paralysed and you are sleeping. But you played a trick on your brain. You are conscious and you know you are asleep. Now you have a choice:

**Open your eyes**

Think of somewhere nice to be and open your eyes. You will probably wake up in your bed anyway. The experiment has failed... Or has it? COUNT YOUR FINGERS. If the answer is not 5 (or if you cannot see the fingers properly) then you are in luck! you are dreaming and you can move as well... go have fun!

**Sit Up THEN Open your eyes**

I prefer to sit up and then open my eyes. In this way my brain cannot trick me into thinking I am paralysed and freak me out. Advanced techniques can also be to fly out of your body and then open your eyes.

**Scary Shit**

So you opened your eyes and lo and behold you are in your room with some [nasty company](http://redd.it/t4kky). You feel you are going to shit your pants, you try to scream but your voice is stuck, you try to move but your arms are like jello. Some motherfucker is sitting on your fucking chest and looking at you with fiery eyes. Did I scare you enough?

Well there is not much you can do and that is why WILD IS AN ADVANCED TECHNIQUE! you will have to use moves that you only learn through lucid dreaming to trick your brain into letting you go to the dream and not representing to you what you fear is happening to your paralysed body.

So please please [try some of the easier techniques before WILD](http://redd.it/rgpse). Except if you like this shit in which case you will probably wake up and find a really hot babe next to you ready for sex. In which case enjoy :)

**Things to try instead**

All the cool kids are WILDing... or that's what you think. In fact there are a lot of easier and more effective techniques you can try:

**The real WILD (Morning WILD)**

A ""morning"" WILD without the scary shit. You wake up preferably about 6 hours after you fell asleep, stay awake for a little bit (I prefer about 5 minutes - go to the bathroom or something) to regain consciousness and then stay still and try to WILD. It works a lot better. Imagine you are snoozing but trying to keep consciousness at the same time. The fact that you are already half asleep and it's probably day helps a lot with avoiding the creepiness... (In fact from what I've read this is the *textbook* WILD technique)

**Re-enter Dream (DEILD - Dream Exit Induced Lucid Dream)**

Basically when you wake up from a dream, don't open eyes etc. stay perfectly still try to keep your consciousness and remember the dream and you might find yourself inside it semi-lucid. Do a reality check.

**Non-wake=&gt;dream techniques**

There are like a million techniques that help you get into dreams or make you realise you are dreaming while you are in the dream. I will not go into these right now, but they also work pretty well. They just need a bit more discipline in everyday life (reality checks, dream journal etc).

Enjoy and if there are useful comments I will incorporate them in the text...

But for testing reality for dreamy qualities nothing breaths the DREAM BREATH for my money. How it works: hold your nose, close your mouth and take a deep breath. In the dream world there is no real hand holding your nose shut and you will in fact breathe. The breath will feel like an awakening of lucidity. 

Edit: thanks for all of the ideas and inspiration. One of the main reasons I like the dream breath is because once you are in the lucid state the dream breaths can act as a stabilizer. Now I'm staring at my hands quite a bit more.

**READ THE SIDEBAR!!!**

Seriously, start there. All of you are asking for help and wondering why you can't do FILD or WILD when it's probably because you aren't starting where you should. Some of you don't even know what WILD means! Lucid dreaming is a skill that is acquired through knowledge and practice.

A dream journal and reality checks are the best place to start and if you are too lazy to put in the work don't be surprised when you don't have great lucids.

Good luck and remember practice, work, and you'll be rewarded.

I hope you all could succeed some tasks of the previous month. Before we start i'll give a short repost from the first task month created by *Oneireus*, for the people who will see this for the first time:

**Repost of the first thread**

For 2012 (to early 2013), I think this subreddit should focus on honing our abilities as well as providing a guideline for anyone who wants to become lucid in one area. The sidebar has a wealth of information, but navigating that is hard for someone who wants to get started today. I propose that once a month for the next 12 months, I will post ideas on how to improve lucidity, awareness, and dream recall.

**Repost End**

So to improve the lucid dreaming task months i will add every month a tip to help improving your abilities and a task for the ones who master the art of lucid dreaming. So the master task is not obligated for the ones who are still practicing.

**This Month's golden tip:**

*Reading about lucid dreaming can help a lot. Besides a book, reading the posts on /r/Luciddreaming can give the same effect*

**This Month's Tasks:**

* As suggested by u/jjoonn56, try flying on a broomstick! Harry Potter style. you can choose to just fly through the dream world, or you can join a game of Quidditch. Catch that golden snitch!


* Explore your dream world! after realising you are dreaming and doing the RC's, just choose a direction and walk. look around and explore a random building!


* Skydive. Believe me, it's awesome


* Step into a car and race. Do impossible stunts wich would probably kill you in real life!


**This Month's Master task:**


The skills a master has is to have full control of your dream and have the possibilty to summon landscapes and huge  buildings in one second.   
So this month you need to start a succesful space launch. 
You need to: 
* Summon a launch platform with a rocket

* Wear a full space suit

* Have DC's checking everything and talking to you through the radio, long story short: control DC's

* Have a succes launching in wich you need to get high enough in space to watch the world

Feel free to give suggestions for tasks for the next month. Also post your succes or failure! Especially when you succeeded on the master task.

Good luck everyone!

A couple years ago I had a lucid dream and decided to try asking my subconscious mind to let me lucid dream every time. I looked around for a door and said to myself ""When I open this door I'll be on a stage, and every person that I ever met or will ever meet will be in the audience"". I walked through the door and I find myself in a small wooden stage but with a HUGE audience, people I haven't seen in so more than 10 years were in the front seats, I don't even know how my mind remembered all those people in just a few seconds.

Anyways, without wasting any time(too afraid I'll wake up), I walk up to the mic and I point out to them how they're not actually real, and that they're in my dream, then I ask them for a favor: ""Next time you see me, please try and convince me I'm dreaming"". They all agree and I can't really remember what happens next.

A couple days later a friend of mine is running towards me yelling that he has something important to tell me. He finally reaches me and tells me that I'm dreaming. I tell him to not to do that, because then when I'm actually dreaming, I won't believe the dream character even when they try to tell me! But he just swears to me that I am dreaming, and tells me to do a reality check. I really am dreaming! And ever since, every few dreams, one of my dream characters would convince me I'm dreaming, even going as far as reminding me of things I wanted to do when I lucid dream or telling me to call for them if I ever need anything. 

This has been happening less and less often though, I don't pay much attention to lucid dreaming anymore.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_rkb6x,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/rkb6x/dream_characters_telling_me_to_do_reality_checks/,

When I choose to lucid dream, I am successful most of the time, probably near 80%.  When I do lucid dream, I perhaps spend 2-3 hours of the 6-8 hours of sleep lucid dreaming, and generally about once per week.  

All my intentional lucid dreams are initiated from being awake.  First, I lie on my stomach, seems that this is the only position from which they initiate.  I begin to fall asleep as normal, and I imagine a dream that I would like to have.  Initially I visualize the dream as a painting (i.e. two dimensional).  I then begin looking into the painting and forcing the painting to wrap around me and become 3D, as if I am stepping into the painting.  

If I try to make something appear, or if I try to interact with the environment to soon, it will come apart and I will wake.  

Once I can feel the scene has become tactile and real (not sure how to explain it, but you KNOW that it is more that a picture or a movie, you KNOW that you can manipulate it) I can start doing what I want.  

If I feel it slipping away, I freeze and force it back into 3D realness.  

This has worked for me after stumbling upon lucid dreams about a year ago.  Also, it is much much easier when I am not exhausted, like if I took a nap during the early evening.  

Let me know if you have any questions and I would be more than happy to answer.  My favorite is flying by far!  But somehow it doesn't work like I want everything, like my brain is forcing some sort of physics reality upon me.

My tip is to try to induce these false awakenings so that you can realize you're dreaming and have a lucid dream. I realize many people have false awakenings naturally, but they don't turn into lucid dreams. If you work to induce them, I think you'll be able to differentiate real from false awakenings easier since you're expecting to falsely awaken.

My tip might work for you or it might not, but I constantly had lucid dreams using it so it definitely works for me!

Pick a day when you can sleep in as long as you want without noise or other things that could wake you up. Sleep regularly, and in the morning, wake up when you're still sleepy and in a state where you can fall asleep really easily. You could do this with an alarm, or get someone to wake you.

I can tell when I'm about to fall asleep, and I think some people who do WILD can as well. For me, that happens when my thoughts are no longer coherent and I can't remember what I was thinking about a second ago. I get this warm feeling and soon I'll be asleep.

In the state of being conscious but about to fall asleep at any second, FOCUS ON WANTING TO DO SOMETHING! For me, it was wanting to check my cell phone for text. You could also try to go to the washroom or go turn on your computer.

What I found in doing this is that I get loads of false awakenings. When I did this one morning, every time I fell asleep it was a false awakening! I would check my cell phone and realize I was still asleep. It happened several times!

Remember to check for false awakenings though, since you could very well just start a regular dream. But I think if you're trying to do this on purpose, you would be prepared for a false awakening and would realize it.

The problem was that the lucid dream always started in my room with me in the bed, and I have trouble teleporting, so it wasn't very exciting. But the scenery outside my window changed with every dream. My room seemed to be very high in an apartment and I'm scared of heights, but several dreams in and I was too bored (I kept waking up middream so I reentered this state many times) so I decided to fly out the window to the scenery...and fell! But I was still dreaming and went exploring on the mountain i fell into.

Please try and tell me if it works for you!



How I Check whether something is a dream or not:
I don't use reality checks. I've been lucid dreaming for a while and I can just FEEL it when it's a dream. Stand still and feel the dream. For me, dreams are very soft and warm and happy and safe, like nothing can hurt me. I feel no discomfort. I get bouts of depression at times and I'm always sort of sad, but in my dreams I never feel this weight of sadness, so it's easy for me to differentiate. Feel your dream and maybe you'll find something about it that is very different from reality for you.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,1345216958.0,,,True,t3_yci9q,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/yci9q/tip_to_enter_lucid_dreams_when_youre_just_waking/,

My mom dropped me off in New York so I could go to this competition that was going on. I saw a unicycle on the side of the road propped up on a bike rack. I picked it up and started riding it. I went into various shops looking for the correct building. I went into a place where a ballerina competition was being held and went in there. The floors were granite and there were pink ribbons draping down from the ceiling. I left there and went down the street. I even remember the street in vivid detail. It was a one-way street and instead of asphalt it was large reddish rounded bricks. There were some blue cars and green cars parked on the side. I went into another shop and it was a brewery. There were big barrel chested men with bald heads and beards brewing beer. I rode up the stairs (awesome) and rode around of the second level and looked at the big beer tanks. I also saw two of the burly men arguing, they stopped as soon as they saw me. I left (still on this unicycle) and went to the last shop I would visit in this dream. It was what looked like a lawyer's office. I got off the unicycle. There was a man sitting on a chair face down on the table. He was either dead or asleep. There was a business card next to him. I picked it up and in very weird looking letters it said, ""Are you dreaming?"" but was formatted like, ""aR U DrEamIng?"" I thought, ""Am I dreaming?"" I did my reality check and I was.

i do reality checks so much it's almost annoying; practically 20% of my waking thoughts are ""how do i know i'm not dreaming right now?"" followed by various attempts to answer that question. i like the nose-pinching thing, for its accuracy/subtlty, and my friend recently told me to ask myself how i got to where i am whenever i find myself in a new location, but i haven't been keeping up with that very well because it's somehow proving hard for me to remember each time.  

my dreams are almost always boring, and though i barely have time to anymore (what with getting ready for school and that kind of stuff) most mornings, i write them down every day anyway and most of the time i remember at least one or two, in pretty good detail. before i go to bed at night, i write down tomorrow's date (that's supposed to help with something or so i hear) and try to concentrate on dreaming, on lucid dreaming -- but it's hard to stay focused as i start to drift off. recently (like today) i thought maybe if i had a mantra, something to repeat to myself while i'm going to sleep, to remind myself i'm about to be dreaming or something like that, that that'd help, maybe.

i do notice myself questioning my reality sometimes in dreams, but it's typically never more than a simple ""oh. that's weird."" or something along those lines, though infrequently i'll think ""i could be dreaming right now"" and then just never do anything about it. 

i think my problem is when i'm dreaming i really don't seem to think about anything. like, there aren't any thoughts... i just observe the situation, you know? i ride through it, kind of unfeeling, and come out on the other side dissapointed. 

anyway, i don't feel like i've made any progress and it's significantly affecting my mood and my self esteem lately -- both how mundane my dreams are and how fruitless my attempts to make them less so have been.

For example, if you expect to pull a cell phone out of your pocket, you will likely be able to. The same process works for walking around a corner and expecting to see a beautiful woman.

I have been experimenting with visualization in my lucid dreams and I have found that in all cases, I am able to consistently make practically anything happen with relative ease.

I believe this works so well because it plays off the expectation principle I noted earlier. Rather than simply expecting something to be there, you physically ""see"" it in your mind's eye to manifest it.

Here's a good example: I was in a lucid dream, sitting in my room, looking at my doorway. I imagined a person walking on the other side of the wall on their way to the door. I imagined them walking all the way to the door, then right when they reached the door, I was actually able to see the person! The first couple times I tried this, they did not look exactly as I had imagined, but after a few more tests, it was a flawless process.

Another example: I found myself surrounded by bad guys. I had a gun, but no ammo. I reached into my pocket and imagined what it would feel like to grab a clip for my pistol. After a few seconds of feeling around while imagining the feeling, I was able to actually feel the clip and pulled it out of my pocket. Pwnage ensued.

Final example: When I first started trying this technique, I held my hands out in front of me and imagined holding a shotgun. After a bit of focus, I was actually holding a shotgun. It didn't function properly, but I was definitely holding something I made out of thin air.

I have been playing with this idea for a while now and with the consistent results I have seen, I am certain that I can make anything happen as long as I have the capacity to imagine it (not just think of an idea, but to imagine the actual experience).

I was a bit nervous about sharing this discovery at first, but after having repeated success with it, I am confident my fellow oneironauts will have a blast trying it out. I really want to hear if anyone finds success with this technique. Please let me know if I can elaborate on any of this. Also, I can't think of a cool name for this process, so suggestions are appreciated.

TL;DR: While lucid, visualize anything and it will happen. Ultimate dream control.

If you're wanting to experience your first lucid dream, or get practice with lucid dreaming, try oversleeping after waking up naturally. 

In the morning, when I wake up, if I don't have anything to necessarily wake up for, I'll not open my eyes, and try to fall back asleep. Generally I'll fall back asleep for another 30 minutes, and I'll repeat the process as many times as I can. During each those 30 minutes, I often have many dreams, and they are much more clear and vivid than what I get at night, and if I'm focusing on being lucid between each 30 minute cycle, I can get about half of them to be lucid. Generally, I can normally repeat these 30 minute naps 8 times, or a total of 4 extra hours of sleep with the ones just after initially waking up being the strongest.

I went into the bar and looked around, then went into the warehouse. The roof or the warehouse was in disrepair, with a large hole in the ceiling, so I went up and patched it. I went back to the floor and looked around for more holes.

A man with an octopus appears, and I'm talking to him about it. I'm looking at the octopus and I start directing it to fuck me with its tentacles. I direct it to not go too deep, and grab a handful of tentacles and show it the speed and rhythm I want. The octopus moves to suck my nipples, and I tell it ""no beak"". This goes on for a while before my dream shifts to something else.

I usually have lucid dreams during the daylight hours, and if I wake up and fall back asleep, my dreams are always erotic. I can control my dreams to an extent, but my dreams shift and change, so it can be hard to ""hold them"". My boyfriend says I moan and rhythmically move in my sleep sometimes. I haven't told him about my erotic lucid dreams.

I've been lucid sleeping since I was a kid, and I think it was to establish control of my nightmares. One nightmare in particular established my first control.

I was so determined to have an out, that It was all I could think of before I fell asleep. It worked. I used that method for many years when I was a kid.

As an adult I can fly by sprouting wings, pilot futuristic fighter jets and spacecraft, use magic at will, defeat aliens and alien crafts by organizing ground troops and gun turrets, find treasure and magical relics by dowsing, pass through walls and objects at will, become invisible, summon magical creatures, teleport, travel to places I've never been before.

Here are some suggestions for other users based on my experiences with it so far and based on my previous experience as a long-time lucid dreamer.

1. Program your Remee to display the lights later in your sleep cycle rather than earlier. You have more frequent periods of REM sleep later in the night and the individual REM cycles last longer. If you program the lights to display later, your odds of them blinking during a REM cycle are much higher.

2. Use lights as a trigger for a reality check. (You can start practicing this in advance even if you haven't received your Remee in the mail yet.)  Throughout the day, every time you notice any change in the light around you, do a reality check. Whenever you turn a light on or off, whenever you see a flickering light (even a candle), whenever you see a car's headlights passing you, etc., perform a reality check. This will make you much more likely to notice Remee's lights in your dreams and you'll already be prepared to do a reality check every time you notice them.

3. Use Remee in conjunction with the Wake Back To Bed technique. If you're not familiar with WBTB, it's one of the simplest and most effective techniques. Go to bed as usual but set your alarm to wake you up a couple of hours earlier than you typically do. When the alarm goes off, get up for about 30 minutes. (Ideally, you should spend that 30 minutes reading about lucid dreaming or performing some other relaxing lucid dreaming-related activity. But, stay off the computer or cellphone since the light from the screen can affect your brain and wake you up too much.)  After 30 minutes, go back to bed and fall asleep while fixing in your mind the idea that you'll become lucid in your dreams. If you're doing a WBTB session, you can program your Remee to go off 30-40 minutes after you go back to bad. That will usually be enough time for you to fall back to sleep and slip into an REM cycle.

I should also mention I have no affiliation whatsoever with the makers of Remee. I've been lucid dreaming for many years, so I didn't really need the mask to help me have lucid dreams but I backed the Remee Kickstarter campaign anyway because I like to support any venture that encourages more people to learn lucid dreaming.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_14020t,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/14020t/three_ways_to_make_your_remee_more_effective_at/,

So excited!,,95,17,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/z0xja/first_successful_intentional_lucid_dream_with/,"That was so fun.  Okay.  So, I went to bed last night feeling pretty lousy with a stuffy nose, having had kind of an emotionally stressful couple of days with a cold on top of it.  Before bed, I took some Benadryl (recommended dosage for sleep) and surfed reddit for a while.  There was one of the usual /r/ld ""Are you dreaming"" posts, and I took a second with that and said no.  

As I started to get tired and eyes/body relaxed, I realized that I felt my body falling asleep but my mind was still pretty active.  I decided to try staying conscious while falling asleep, like I had been practicing for a while.  I picked some repetitive task to imagine myself doing, and I think (it's a bit unclear as I was already drifting) I ended up imagining petting my cat until I entered my dream.  

Petting my cat turned into something entirely different - something involving some sort of tool and some fabric.  I was working hard on it, and then in no time at all, I just realized I was dreaming.  I looked at whatever I was working on, and I thought, ""I don't need to do this.  This isn't real.  I'm dreaming.""  And then I was standing there holding this thing I was working on in a wide open field with rolling hills.  Then immediately I thought, ""Fuck yeah!  I'm dreaming!  I'm lucid!  I'm going to fly!""  I just kicked off, flapped, and there was that feeling.  I've had flying dreams before, but none this real and this in control.  I flapped around for a while until the thought occurred to me that since this was a dream, I didn't even have to flap and kick to stay in the air.  So then I relaxed and just soared like a peaceful glider for a while.  Pure bliss.  Holy crap.

Then I started trying to change the scenery.  I thought, ""Well, I'm flying now, I should explore something,"" and then there was a small town in front of me and I swooped around there for a while.  This part didn't last long, because I started to lose control here.  I started drifting down to the ground and I couldn't get myself back up.  I ended up walking in the city for a minute and that's where I think I completely lost it because I don't remember the rest.

I'm starting off by saying I've had two or three before, but this one was intense, and those dreams were ages ago before I've tried to lucid intentionally 

First 1 -  Running on the motorway 


The dream started with me jogging along this motorway /highway. The tarmac was pure black, like it had been freshly laid with tarmac, there were streetlights spaced on the path like a regular motorway, and it gave the road a glossy shine 

Have you seen the movie Inception, the restaurant scene, where she doesn't know how she got there? 
That's what happened to me, I found myself jogging /gliding along, and realised I'm lucid dreaming. It wasn't jogging like real life, I felt myself moving as somebody does when they jog. Yet my legs didn't feel like they moved, and I skipped some of the motorway, I would look ahead, and find myself near there, like I've covered distance while looking. While I was running, I felt this presence behind me on the right, I didn't look but visualised it as a white hue of light, and identified it as my consciousness. I thought stay relaxed, and keep distance, and then thought it's time to fly 

http://www.imgur.com/nZa4r.jpeg -  the motorway looked like this, but it was straight and only streetlights 

Part 2 -  Flying 

I once had a lucid dream I flew, so I felt confident.  I made a motion like swinging my arms from my side to ahead of me. Imagine throwing water at somebody with a large bucket. 
I started to fly and I skimmed my house roof and I was away, I felt intense emotion of happiness and I felt free and light. I did some arcs I think, and felt amazing. Then unfortunately I saw my house again,  I hit a lamppost I think? Then I flew just about into my room window, but I felt sad to go back 


Part 3 -  Not sure if dream ended or I woke up?? 

When I entered the room, I found myself opening my eyes and looking, I was on my bed, I then closed my eyes and didn't wake up again .  I don't think I actually woke up for that moment, because the room didn't feel right somehow angle wise? 

Even though I wrote a lot here, the dream felt like it lasted for a minute or two. 


I'm writing this because I hope somebody enjoys it and because I suffer from depression and it felt amazing to have this dream and feel so happy and free

During one of the segments of the show it shows how one researcher discovered that scents have a backdoor access to our sleeping minds.

 http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/28/science/study-shows-learning-of-smells-and-sounds-in-sleep.html?_r=0

Basically the brain can learn when associated with scents while sleeping. 

What I propose is that we use this to our advantage and use a reverse method. To learn an association while we our awake and trigger it while we are resting. When you do an RC associate it with a scent, piece of leather, a perfume, etc. 

After a few weeks of of programming your mind to associate RCs with your selected scent, you would need to find a way to release this scent while you are in REM state and hopefully cause you're dream self to initiate an RC during a dream.  

Perhaps a timed power stip:

http://www.homedepot.com/p/GE-7-Day-8-Outlet-Power-Strip-Timer-15077/100685866#.Uf7sIJKmhqg

With an oil diffuser:

http://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/economy-ceramic-burner-rustic-mauve.html?___store=default&amp;gclid=CL_nmbSB5bgCFQJqMgodty4A-g

Set it to go off to go once or twice during your sleep cycle for 10 minutes at a time.

Just an idea, haven't tested this theory yet. Would like to hear other ideas and opinions on this test.

TL;DR:
 

1.Scents can access mind during sleep

2.Train Mind to associate RC with selected scent while awake.

3:Release scent with timed oil diffuser at night while asleep to trigger programmed RC while in rem sleep.

I woke up at my normal time (730ish) and after some debate, decided I was going to stay in bed for a couple more hours as my first classes of the day don't start until 2PM. 

As I drifted back to sleep I haphazardly attempted WILD - pretty much just told myself to try and realize if I was dreaming (though I didn't really put much effort into it like I usually do). 

Next thing I know, I was in an abandoned, beatdown warehouse or factory. I was walking around, looking for someone and then it just clicked: *why the fuck am I in a factory...*

I thought I must be dreaming, and the dream started to dissolve. As soon as this happened I began spinning in circles as fast as I could and after 10 or so rotations it began to stabilize again. 

I continued walking and found who I was looking for (let's call her Sarah). What's strange is that in my waking life, Sarah is not more than acquaintance, whom honestly I don't particularly like. 
Whatever.
Her and I were walking around, pretty sure we were looking for a place to hookup, when I feel like we're being followed. I start to get uneasy and the feeling of being chased intensifies. We start running through corridors, darting between rooms, until I finally see someone come through the door and come at us. 

I was pretty scared, until remembering *you're dreaming, dumbass. fall through the floor*
And just like that, Sarah and I slipped through the floor like it was nothing.

The chase pursued, but it became more like a game. They'd come at us, and I'd just pull her through a wall/floor/ceiling with me. 

This went on for a bit until Sarah said

""They're never going to let us be together""

and I woke up.

I do reality checks every two hours, everyday. I keep a dream journal where I record all my dreams, highlight dream signs, etc. 

What caused me to have my first lucid dream tonight was the realization of something that could not exist in real life. I've always had dreams about Greece, I used to live there when I was a kid (I live in the Netherlands right now), and it became the reoccurring theme of most of my dreams. I kept all this in mind every night for the whole month, that if something in my dream was somehow connected to Greece, that I should realize that it was a dream. But as we all know, it's not as easy as it seems. 

In the dream I was just in my class at school when I noticed a classmate from Greece. I greeted her, we hugged, talked, etc. But then I noticed that she's from Greece and laughed about how I always dream about my classmates from Greece. But then something happened. It just clicked. An association was made with dreams and past experiences. 

""It couldn't be,"" I thought. So then I did my reliable reality check. I counted the fingers on my right hand. Six. BAM! I had full control over my actions. Absolutely full. I also felt the feeling that the dream became less detailed all of a sudden, just a little (probably from getting a little excited). But I calmed myself down, and it stabilized. 

I didn't do anything special, because I knew that if I did something crazy, the dream would collapse. I simply walked around the classroom and paid attention to everything around me. I could see every little detail, but was more amazing is that I had absolutely full control over my conscious actions. It was unbelievable.

So there, I had my first lucid dream and now I'm over-my-head excited about it. And you know why I got it? **Dedication.**

I spent the entire month researching lucid dreaming, trying different methods to lucid dream (WBTB, WILD, MILD, etc), keeping a detailed dream journal, doing reality checks *everyday*, and in general, being completely obsessed with the idea itself. 

I've had so many failed attempts that I wanted to just abandon everything, mostly because it cost me time and energy, and I thought it was all going to waste. No. It wasn't. **Hard work pays off**, because something you're obsessed with in real life will always find some way into your dreams. *You just have to give it time and keep trying*.


Good luck!

The dream leading up to it was rather interesting (I thought so, at least):  I was sitting in my truck on a highway near my house, and in the passenger seat was this girl I used to work with at a food cart when I lived in Portland, OR.  She was telling me that she liked me, or something to that effect.  Then she ""teleported"" out of the truck, and I knew that I would need to drive on ahead to meet up with her.  So I'm driving down the highway, and on the pavement itself this girl had painted, in huge block letters, all the reasons she would make an excellent girlfriend (she came on a bit strong in real life, too).  I can't remember what any of them were, unfortunately.  

But so I finally drive up to this adult video store on the highway called ""Darling's,"" which does in fact exist in real life.  I get out of the truck, and think to myself, ""Wait... am I dreaming?""  Run through the RCs, fail all of them.  The dream suddenly took on this bright, vivid quality, as if someone had just wiped the fog off of a camera lens.  I walk into Darling's, which turns out to be a cafe/diner, and which is packed full at the moment.  I stumble forward, drunk from the lucidity, trying to catch a nearby table.  Fade to black.  

I'm now in total darkness, in a zero-gravity but extremely cold environment, like space.  I think to myself, ""Warm pants!"" and my legs immediately get warm.  At this point, I roll over and finally wake up.

Direct:

We also considered the names Ship-a-thon 2012, Shipstravaganza, and Ship Happens. Any way you slice it, shipping of Remee has commenced! Except for quick break on Thursday for cranberry sauce and family arguments, we'll be shipping nearly around the clock until we're caught up. We spent a lot of time ahead of this making sure our fulfillment process was a well oiled machine - this was time well spent. We're processing and shipping far more per day than we ever expected to be able to, and doing our absolute darnedest to get every Remee shipped out as fast as possible.

Many of you have received shipping notifications already. We're packing now and all day tomorrow for a drop off first thing Monday morning, and will continue to do morning and evening shipments throughout the week. We owe you at least two more updates before shipping is complete, one of which will deal with the Web Appplication used to customize Remee. Expect that on Monday or Tuesday.

At this risk of sounding like a broken record: thank you, thank you, thank you. You've been incredibly supportive, helpful, and understanding throughout this process. We know it has been frustrating at times, sticking with us through delays and setbacks, and no poor words of ours can adequately convey our appreciation.

Keep calm, and dream. 

2) Don't go overboard. Dreaming fantastical worlds into existence, or doing insane things immediately can actually make lucid dreams boring after a while, and then causes you to lose interest, because you've already done everything you've wanted to try.

3) Physics may not be a necessity in a dream, but knowing the basics of how it works, and applying that to a dream can make that dream feel just a little more complex, and can be appreciated a little more....

4) No Wild Sex. I know, I know, ""But PhillipPriddy, i wanna fuck a million hot women/men...."" okay, but don't sit there and go crazy. if you do, you wake up, because you got excited, or you have a lot of wet dreams. yes, i know it's tempting, so the best way to go is with one person, and have minimal movement during (have the person give oral, or have them on top).

5) Give yourself small challenges to work your brain. maybe you want to make a sculpture out of marble. look up the actual tools used to sculpt marble, get a good idea of how to do it, and try it in your dreams. you might try it in reality, and be pretty good. these small challenges keep dreams interesting, and can really give you  a sense of purpose in a dream that can help keep you dreaming.

6) Not all dreams will be lucid. if you start Lucid Dreaming, and then suddenly stop for a few days, Don't get discouraged. You will have moments when you won't be able to. this can be from a change in medications, change in diet, change in stress levels, or just plain tired, and needing sleep.

7) Fictitious Characters are FICTITIOUS. don't make a dream character, and devote your entire time to them. the best way to go, is to make a dream character, and FEATURE them in your dreams, but don't make them the main object of focus. After all, they are you....

8) Unnecessary killing is just...unnecessary. maybe you are a mighty warrior in your dreams and fight evil. good for you. but, if you just enjoy hacking people up, you're gonna have a bad time. eventually, dreams will just start to get to a point where they run together from battle to battle, and murder to murder...

9) applying reality to your dreams can screw you up. Maybe having something take place in the same area you live in isn't so bad, but when your dream characters become real people in the waking world (Mom in real life; Mom in dream. Girl you like in real life: same girl does you daily in dream) You start to lose grasp of what's Awake Normal and what's Dream normal. so, your reality checks lose effect, and you stop dreaming.

10) Don't fall in love with a dream lifestyle. it gets to a point where you can actually want to just sleep nonstop. and YES you CAN get addicted to lucid dreaming. it isn't a chemical addiction, just an Emotional one.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_11f1ju,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/11f1ju/been_off_the_subreddit_for_a_while_refining_my/,

Rather than going to waste, I'm sharing it in its own thread.

Definitions:

* [Hypnagogia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia)

* [Sleep Paralysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis)

* [WBTB](http://lucid.wikia.com/wiki/Wake_Back_To_Bed)

* MILD - see Sidebar

I've been practicing the WILD technique for some months now, and I'm just starting to get the hang of it. Here are some of the techniques I personally perform (obviously, your experience might be different, feel free to mix and match), and hopefully you can take some of these techniques and apply them as you see fit:

1. Mentally Prepare: As you are getting ready for bed, try to clear your mind. Try to get off of reddit about an 30-45 minutes prior to going to sleep. Perhaps read a book or simply sit in silence. Avoid watching TV, playing video games or otherwise using electronics. Music may be okay so long as it isn't at full volume. Try to listen to soothing music, not hardcore metal or dubstep. I prefer classical: Beethoven or Mozart.

2. Lie Completely Still: This is really tough, it takes A LOT of practice and patience. Some nights are better than others for me. Like I've said, I've been working on this for months. If you have an itch, try to avoid scratching it. HOWEVER, if you let your mind focus on the itch, it will totally ruin the experience, as the thought will perpetuate yourself. See the [White Bear Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Bear_Principle) If this is the case, scratch the itch, and reset your body's position. Some people report being able to adjust their body without breaking their focus i.e. snapping out of the hypnagogic state. This is not the case for me. Perhaps you are able to do it.   

3. MILD While WILDing: MILD, or mnemonic induced lucid dreaming, as seen in the side bar, is the practice of repeating to your self that you will become lucid in a dream. Not only does this technique increase the likelihood of lucid dreaming, but it also keeps your mind from wondering onto other things (things that may or may not be stressful, or require your full brain attention). Alternately, you can practice your breathing, however, try to keep the breathing light, rather than full breaths, as this typically isn't how the body breathes when you are sleeping, and more importantly, breathing manually isn't exactly natural. Again, focusing on your breathing is strictly to keep your mind from wondering into complex scenarios or worrying about homework (or work).

4. (Optional) Get an Eye Mask: I personally try to enter the WILD state while keeping my eyes open (this also takes a tremendous amount of practice). Subsequently, in order to not be distracted by light, and/or the contents of my room, have purchased a sleeping mask. Best 4 dollars spent (in regards to dreaming). This will also increase the likelihood of seeing visual hallucinations brought on by the hypnagogic state. (if that's no your 'thing' then perhaps skip it. But certainly, don't knock it 'till you've tried it.)

5. (Optional) Noise-canceling headphones: I'm somewhat of an self-described audiophile, and without getting into an argument about which headphones are the best, I've got a pair of BOSE (supra-aural) noise-canceling headphones. And while these cost about ~300 dollars, if you have the opportunity to use them, they will make a boat load of different (especially in a city setting - if you are in the middle of bumbfuck nowhere, then this might not be an issue). Additionally, I listen to a 20 minute long white noise track, that I can upload upon request [its a big file]. Basically, If I make it through the white noise track and manage to stay awake, the chances of staying awake (for me) for another 20 or so minutes is fairly trivial). If I fall asleep, then tonight wasn't a good night to try to WILD. I might make a point to say that, while the white noise can be beneficial, the fact that I know how long it has been (when the track ends) gives me a good perception of how long I have been WILDing, which in my opinion, if you can perceive how much time has past, it really pulls you out of the experience, to the point where nothing will happen. **This being said, on successful WILD attempt, it usually takes me 20 minutes (for the white noise) and an additional 20-30 minutes before I find myself crossing the hypnagogic threshold into what I call a dreamscape setting, which personally feels like a combination of falling, gliding, flying and is extremely surreal, if when you wake up, you can actually put into words or sentences.**

6. This section is more of a rant about the perpetual bad-mouthing of Sleep Paralysis. Sleep Paralysis is NATURAL, and such, there is very little to be 'afraid' of. Sure, I've had experiences where 'loud' noises come from nowhere (just the other night, a blaring fire alarm went off in my mind for no reason), and I've even had the experience of my heart racing ,and the 'pressure' one experiences on the chest for seemingly no reason - this being said, if you are comfortable in the bed you are sleeping in, there is extremely little reason to be terrified of the sights and sounds you might encounter coming exclusively from your mind. Personally, I lock my door, such that my roommates cannot disturb me.

I hope you to-be lucid dreamers can find this thread useful in some respects.

**tl;dr - if you want to practice WILDing, its most likely in your best interest to actually read what I've written.**

EDIT1::

Dream Journal: I might also add that I keep a dream journal that I try to write in daily. If not contents of dreams, than at least keywords, colors, feelings and concepts that give even the slightest insight into my own dreams.

It might also be important to note that I have recently quit smoking pot, and my dreams have become more vivid and vibrant than prior to...

I just had a terrible experience with what I thought was going to be a great ld. So it starts off with me in a carnival. Wasn't really any music which sort of made it eerie and there were gray clouds. The only real thing that made it seem like a carnival was a big Ferris Wheel and those booths where you shoot things for prizes. The first time I noticed something was off was when I stepped into one of those house of mirrors.... Right when I stepped in, before I could look at a mirror something pushed me (not physically) to look at my hand. So I did and just like that, I new I was dreaming. I stepped outside into where the sky was red. Every one was a clown. Every single one of them, staring me down straight in the eye with no hesitation. They had this crazy blank look on their faces. This is when I started to panic and I thought, no problem. I have control so I can just fly away. So I started sort of soaring across land, but when I landed. I was right back where I started. Then, strangely enough there was a HUGE cliff at the carnival. I jumped off of it and woke up! Or so I thought, I then woke up in another dream. Except, I woke up into the same dream. Everytime I ran or thought I woke up, I would end up surrounded by the nearing clowns again. This went on for ages. I took step back then fell through the ground into a dark room. In the room it was like I just felt fear. For no reason at all. Just petrified. So I though ok I'm still in control, I can tell myself to wake up! I was thinking all of this because I'm usually mute in my dreams. When i try to tell myself to wake up though, A clown said ""Oh no you don't"" then threw me off a cliff where I then thought I had woken up. I was in another stage where it felt like I was lying down on my bed. Except it was very dark. I felt glued to my bed. I couldn't get up, the whole time hearing voices and seeing shadows. I finally then woke up from THAT dream in a cold sweat. I woke up in my car which is in the garage all the way across my house.....

Last week I quit smoking and went over the initial paranoia, so now I am fixing up my sleep and felt a huge need to LD again after some time (almost 6 months since my last one but I wasn't trying).

So I found this subreddit (I was always in DV back in the day) and wrote a couple of tutorials. One for WILDing and one for [Noobs](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/rgpse/my_guide_for_noobs_in_lding_beginner_techniques/) and I spent the last 3-4 hours last night cleaning the house and answering questions in the tutorial. I really primed my subconscious well.

I went to bed and was super-confident I would LD!

I became Lucid looking at my hand (I did a subconscious RC) at some point in my dream. I was really young (maybe 18 or something) and I was a ""virgin"". There was a guy there (which was the real me I think) that was going to help me have my first sex. He summoned a nice girl out of a building and told me to go with her.

We held hands and went up to a balcony overlooking the city and the starry sky. We hugged and looked at the view. An interesting thing I really remember was that the stars in the sky were extremely bright and impressive, and I was pointing out constellation (I don't know anything about that IRL) and the animal or thing would highlight on the sky in this beautiful ochra/yellow color on the sky like in old maps. It was great.

So I forgot about sex and was just hugging and looking at the incredible view, when from the street below I hear explosions and something like drums (Bam Bam Bam, trtrtrtrtrtttt). There is a demonstration in the street downstairs and the people are coming through with drums up front - it's a glorious sight. (IRL my heating does this banging noise when it starts working and then the fan starts that sounds a bit like the beginning of a drum roll).

After that I kind of lost lucidity (got over-excited) and had a false awakening,

ALWAYS CHECK YOUR HAND WHEN YOU AWAKE - ALWAYS!

I didn't do a RC :( and I woke up in my old room in my parents house (haven't lived there for 10 years). Where I ensued to tell my parents I've been LDing but they were assholes (they are really nice IRL) and they were telling me I forgot to go and tell the guy that fixes the doors something etc. (I remembered upon waking that I have to go and make a second key for my door because my parents are visiting from out of town - thanks dream).

After that my alarm clock went off (that I had set for WILDing) and I woke up.

---

So I think that this LD was directly induced by me writing the tutorial and ""guiding"" some LD ""virgins"" towards their first LD. My subconscious appeared like older me, and my conscious for some reason like younger me (living with parents etc). Who knows... It was great fun though, very vivid and worth it just for the star-gazing...

That and the fact that my oldest dream setting decided to run into a mega-mall without warning. Not sure how I feel about that.

Anyways, I was stuck in a continuing high school class (where I knew that I was 25 and had already gone to college), one girl starts giving me shit about a group project we were working on, and I stood up, told her she was a figment of my imagination and started floating around the room. 

I got to play with someone's coin collection, a professional make-up counter and flee from a giant mechanical T-rex inside that mega-mall. After that blew over, I got to hang out with some dear friends and one doppleganger, and then my boyfriend came rolling up on some kind of bike. Finally got to kiss him after he mysteriously dissapeared half a dream ago.

I was working on a continuation of the same t-shirt design from another dream. I normally have a huge problem with letters and keeping track of things like that, but I typed out most of a facebook status by focusing on the keyboard layout instead of the monitor. 

After opening the fridge to try and conjure myself some pudding, I found it full of empty drinking glasses. But I gave it one more try on the bottom drawer by closing my eyes first and then sticking my hand in. And it worked! Not only that but I pull out two different kinds and managed to keep track of them both for the length of a crowded storage room, grab a spoon for myself and make it back to my seat. 

Might not seem like much to some of you, but even when I know I'm dreaming, my dreams have a habit of distracting me and making me lose things. Before this I'd been jet-lagged or otherwise unable to sleep myself out, so last night was such a treat.

If you're a newcomer, I suggest you check out all the consensus tips around. This is in no way an attempt to undermine those methods, although I personally have never tried them.

I have been lucid dreaming for years. Every dream I've had in the past two or three years (that I remember, of course) has been lucid. To be honest, I don't remember many specific non-lucid dreams I've had in my entire life (which is sad; non-lucid dreams are fun too!). So I suppose I've mastered lucidity without any outside help. I figure my self-taught, completely naive approach could be a refreshing alternative to those who may have trouble with the methods of this subreddit; as we all know, different things work for different people.

My first lucid experiences were with nightmares. I'm sure everyone's had some sort of terrifying dream where you eventually wake yourself up intentionally out of fear. Since you're aware that you're dreaming, that is a form of lucidity, although you don't exhibit any control of the dreamscape. So if you've ever figured out a nightmare isn't real and woken yourself up: congrats! You were lucid.

Eventually, I put two and two together: dreams draw substance from your mind. There isn't some magic fairy putting those themes into your head, so obviously you have some sort of control over your dreams. I convinced myself, after a few nightmares where I would wake myself up, to remain calm in that situation and try and think myself out of it. So in my dream, I closed my eyes, and thought of something else. Something simple, like my room. When I opened my eyes, I was in my room. I got excited and woke up accidentally. Oh well. I had proved to myself that I could do anything I wanted.

From there, I just practiced keeping calm in my dreams and summoning things. It took a while to master control of my dreams, and if you're looking for a quick way to gain control, the methods are probably much easier than simply going through dozens of rough quality lucid dreams like I did.

So I guess my best insight to provide is that **YOU** have total control over your dreams. Stay calm and try not to get emotional when you're dreaming, because that's the easiest way to rouse your brain to wake up. Everyone should understand that there is an equilibrium to lucid dreaming: if you keep your brain too inactive, you'll lose lucidity and fall back into a normal dream. If you are too active, you'll wake up. So keep calm, know that you've got everything under control, and you'll have fun lucid dreaming!",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_1b5i1u,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1b5i1u/i_didnt_even_know_lding_was_a_thing_until_a_few/,

I ""wake up"" next to him in the dark, and can tell by the feel of the situation that I'm lucid dreaming, but the feeling is darker than usual. I realize that my boyfriend is not breathing, and is quite cold, so I start shaking him to try and wake him up. I then ""wake up"" again- same situation, but this time I'm not lucid.

I realized I have one technique that works very well and most of my lucid dreams start like this. 

I usually wake up in the morning a few hours early, open my eyes for a few minutes, then go back to sleep. When I close my eyes, I imagine that I'm looking through my eyelids at whatever is on the other side (like my eyelids are invisible). I concentrate on making out the images of whatever I'm supposedly looking at (nightstand, lamp, closet, window...) After a few minutes, when I think I'm asleep, I'll get out of bed and check to see if I'm dreaming or not. This has worked a few times for me and seems to be working more often the more I try it. 

Also, this is probably something most of you already know, but looking at your hands or a clock works and is really great to test if you're dreaming or not. Whenever I think I'm dreaming I immediately look at the palms of my hands. I'll notice the lines are all messed up. Sometimes I will do this a few times over and over to make sure, and the lines always move to different places. If I look at a clock, there will be weird characters, not numbers. I always do this right after I realize I'm dreaming and if I'm about to do something crazy in my dream.

Here's a random thing I tried in a recent lucid dream in case anyone's interested. I looked in a mirror to see if I looked the same. I looked exactly the same as I usually do. I thought that was interesting.

In my dream, I remember talking to my girlfriend about some mundane topic. Don't even remember the dialogue. All I remember (before the excitement) is that my body heard rain outside, and it was sunny in my dream. I pondered why I would hear rain and then it started raining! I knew something wasn't right, so I looked up at the sky and I remember thinking, ""I'm dreaming. I know it.""

Next thing I know, I started to perform a RC, and *before i even put my fingers to my palm*, I went lucid. It felt like my entire body was tingling for a few seconds, my vision kind of went way back and super wide, then it snapped back into place and I knew I was in control. I jumped for joy and I was somehow able to keep things stable for a few minutes.

To test my new-found power, I decided to conjure an iPhone 5 (why, i don't know, I hate the things), and it most certainly appeared in my hand. After that, I got REALLY excited that I was finally lucid, and I could feel my eyes opening. I tried to calm down and stay in the dream, but it was already too late.

Now I'm just confused as to how I achieved this. I was dreaming normally when I noticed the weather shift, perhaps I was more aware than I thought? The dream felt more real before I noticed everything and became lucid, compared to just a typical night.

I kept my dream journal, did my daily finger-counting, tried regularly to WILD, MILD, WBTB (last one mostly resulted in me arriving late at work ""shit, I forgot to adjust my alarm clock when going back to sleep""), I even installed the iPhone app, but no success.

So tonight, I went to sleep as usual, chanting to myself ""I'm going to lucid-dream""/""I""m going to remember my dream"" while feeling my body go through SP, with my phone next to me.

Next thing I know, I think I'm driving back from work (yeah, I feel offended that the best dream my subconscious can throw at me is some boring daily routine), and I hear my own voice (but not me speaking) saying ""hey, this is not normal, you can't be here, you're asleep, do a RC"" (the message I recorded on the app) and I directly realize I'm dreaming.

From then on, things went too quickly.
I try to count my fingers to be sure, but I can't focus on my hand long enough (""ok, definitely a dream"").
I feel the world is spinning and trying to escape me, but I somehow manage to get a hold of it, except now I feel as if my view is tilted (you know, kind of like when you tilt your phone... Same thing here, but it was my view). I maintain that for a bit, then decide to let go as it gets harder and I can't do much.

Woke up in my bed, fresh as a daisy, laying on my side (I went to sleep on my back, I *know* that's why I felt ""tilted"" in the dream).

I've only lucid dreamed three times before in my life so this was really exciting.

I set an alarm for 6 hours after I went to sleep. When it went off I took 8mg Galantamine and 300mg CDP choline. It was sort of hard falling back to sleep because reality itself was fairly vivid (the sounds of cars passing by were FAR more noticeable than usual). I suppose in reality it was a combo of the chemicals and WILD since I was up for maybe 15 minutes, I don't know.

When I did manage to fall asleep I was treated to 3 lucid dreams. Each more magical than the last (I was woken up briefly in between each)

1) I was in the past, seeing old friends from high school. I was excited to tell them all about their futures. I knew I was dreaming, but I didn't seem to understand that this wasn't actually the past, and that Zac Efron was never my classmate.

- My alarm went off.

2) I was on a beach. Very vivid detail in general. I outright knew I was dreaming. I did a finger count reality check and my hands warped like crazy. Fingers added and lost, one was a tentacle. My brain is weird. I wanted to see my girlfriend so I sort of summoned her there and she flew off from the distance to where I was. I tried to fly but this woke me up.

- The dream dissolved when I tried to fly and I woke up briefly.

3) This was in war ridden 1940's Europe. The entire dream was focused around trying to fly. I had to continuously rub my hands together and look at them while I was slowly rising up. Something about the flying thing makes the dream want to dissolve really quickly. I probably need to spend more time stabilizing before I attempt anything crazy.

The second two were very vivid. Almost magical. I can only describe it as what I imagine heaven would be like. 

- The flying proved too much and the dream disolved.

[Long],callyfree,99,26,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1cymrw/i_had_a_breakthrough_last_night_long/,"This is copy and pasted from a google doc vomit/writing session I had this morning, so please excuse the poor quality. I was just trying to get it all down.

----------------------

Last night I had a breakthrough dream. I went to bed without any intentions besides getting some rest. I began dreaming, I forget about what, and somehow I got to a point of discomfort. I don't remember what it was but it was disconcerting. But I welcomed it. I had been waiting for a moment like this where I’d be lucid enough to practice courage and love, so I was happy to have this moment. This all stemmed from the Ted Talks I saw about confronting your greatest fears in dreams with love, so I thought I would practice it ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1i6A7t6L2g ). So in this moment of discomfort and lucidity, I dreamt up a hoard of monsters crowded in the facade of a building; it resembled a little like the lincoln memorial, except there was no lincoln. I felt a twang of fear at first in confronting these monsters. But I jumped in there with love and started hugging as many as I could and sincerely gave them my affection. And they reciprocated with love too. It was really a jovial moment with truly happy feelings to be around them. 


And then the most amazing thing happened. I felt myself beginning to evolve. Not just in my dream, but I felt this in my physical body. I was lucid enough to still understand that I was dreaming and that I must allow myself to be present with this breakthrough experience. I knew this was an important moment. Something opened up in my mind and spirit and an energy began coursing through my body. Perhaps not through, but from. This incredible energy was releasing itself from all over my body in waves. It was the most intense release I’ve ever felt.


And then I was transported. I was catapaulted into the universe. I’m not sure if I was astral projecting or just visualizing this unexplored part of our psyche - I say ""our"" psyche because it felt like it didn’t belong to me. It was the cosmos and belonged to no one and everyone. It was probably both. And it was so peculiar because even though I don’t remember this happening, it felt like this was the second time I had been through this. It felt as if I had a previous memory of this or something like this in my dreams before.  


I flew through light years of cosmos and saw stars, luminescent gases, and the infinite space. It did not feel empty. It felt like the cosmos itself had a presence to it. And its parts were so vibrant and harmonious in the darkness that I did not feel lost or alone.


Eventually I came to an energy portal. It was a giant beam of energy. There were patterns inside of the beam. It’s hard to describe the shapes of the patterns, but it like a cross between a honey comb pattern and that of brain coral reef. It was purple and felt like the rain. I flew transported through these textures in this beam and it felt like I was being lovingly showered by fat rain drops, though without the wetness.


And then I arrived in this magnificent purple-pink cloud space. It felt primally feminine and vast with an infinite array of purple and pink fluff. It was the most magical experience to be able to feel the wind against my skin blowing upon me from all directions. I felt this on the skin of my physical body. And somewhere in my flight, I decided that instead of being flown, I would like to fly myself, so took control and began to explore. 


The space was initially disorienting. There was no up or down or sense of direction. Only me floating and flying around in this vast purple-pink cloud space. There was no sky to contrast the clouds, only a suggestion of it hiding behind the layers. There was nothing, only the bulbous colored softness with some linings of sun light beyond the break.


My initial astonishment began to fade, and I wanted to see more. It was conflicting being there. On the one hand, I felt it an amazing privilege to be there to feel and witness this. But on the other hand, there was something left to be desired. I felt somewhat smothered. I wanted to be where the light was. I wanted to see and be in the blue sky, not contained in this pink womb space. So I flew and explored looking for something else, probably the sky. Eventually I found it. Or rather, I almost found it. I saw hues of blue and rays of light in the breaks of the purple pink clouds, and this excited me. I began to fly in that direction. 


But my corporal curiosities got the better of me. I wanted to see if I could really see this with my physical eyes instead of my mental ones. So I slowly began opening my left eye. And in this moment of inbetweening I’m still not sure if I was able to or not. But the interjection of my physical body began to unravel my connection with this cloud space. I felt this happening so I closed my physical eye and tried to get back into it. But I was already falling back down through the beam that brought me in. But I didn’t want to leave yet. So I relaxed my spirit again and felt some of the energy swell and release through my body. And for a moment I stayed there in this honeycomb coral beam. I felt uplifted momentarily. Maybe I could get back inside. But I don’t know if I did. Because that’s all that I can remember.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_1cymrw,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1cymrw/i_had_a_breakthrough_last_night_long/,

There are two very common mistakes when attempting a RC in a dream. I will try to keep this brief, while making it as clear as possible.

First of all - you remembered to do a RC while in a dream? That's great! Congrats, you are one giant step closer to a lucid dream! Now, things you have to remember while preforming your RC:

1. Keep your RC simple. If you try to do complicated things such as trying to fly or passing through walls before you're familiar with lucid dreaming - you'll probably fail since these actions should only be attempted after you're sure it is a dream because they require more visualizing. You need to concentrate in order to do these activities. Try to read something instead. Anything accessible will do - looking at a clock, flipping a switch... these have a better chance at proving it's a dream because making a switch work as it should requires more imagination, so it probably won't work before you're lucid.

2. Expectation. Whenever you try a RC, you should EXPECT it to prove to you it's a dream. If you look at a watch in a dream and see it's 10:00 am, look away and then look back while thinking it should still be 10:00 am, guess what? it will show 10:00 am. Always try to change something that shouldn't change in reality, and if it does change: it's a dream!

Do this, and I promise that you'll never fail a RC in a dream again. I write this out of experience - I know how annoying it can be to wake up and think ""i'm an idiot!"".

No tl;dr on this, i'm afraid. Hope this helps, and I wish you all good and lucid nights (:",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_ww66o,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/ww66o/small_reality_check_tip/,

I never thought of it as an option until I came here and it was pretty cool.


So I've always had very good dream recall ever since I was a kid. I can vividly describe most of my dreams several hours after I wake up before they fade. I've always been able to do that. Lucidity isn't really new to me either. I become naturally lucid in dreams if I had to guess I'd say 4 to 5 times a year. But I never actually tried to change the dream. I've always had a sudden thought like ""Woah, I'm dreaming"" and then one of two things happen. I immediately wake up (the most common) or I continue on with the dream as normal without changing any of my actions just with the internal knowledge that I am dreaming.


How I generally become lucid is this; I am a very logical person by nature and at times when the internal consistencies in a dream seem too strange I suddenly realize the only logical explanation for the happenings in the dream are that I am in fact dreaming (I hope that makes sense).


Here's an example: The most common time I lucidly dream is during those dreams where you are like randomly naked. Everybody has those right? You're at school or at you're job in the nude and all embarrassed. Well when I have these dreams, my dream characters never seem to care that I'm showing everyone my naughty bits. They know I'm naked, they just don't care and go about there daily business. My internal embarrassment is the only thing that makes these dreams stressful. Occasionally during these dreams my brain says 'Hey, why aren't people having a normal reaction to this, you know, outrage and shock?' and then I realize I must be dreaming.


Well today I became lucid three times in one nap!! In the first dream (regular old stress dream) I realized I was an hour late for something I had promised to do and had to rush to get there. There were all sorts of ridiculous obstacles and I couldn't seem to make it to the location. I'd fall asleep and end back up at my house, or there was a traffic jam, or I'd break something and have to deal with that first. All while the ticking clock of how late I was got later and later.  At one point I was sitting in traffic at a red light that seemed like it had been red an hour when I suddenly thought 'This is ridiculous, I drive here every day almost and it takes 15 minutes. It's been like 2 hours now, this can't be real' and that's when I became lucid to the dream.


But instead of just continuing on in the dream I decided 'hey if this is a dream lets try and do something' That thought alone is a totally novel one for me and was a huge step. So I tried to throw the blue mini van in front of me into the air (cause go big or go home). The car started to shake and move and the dark haired woman driving it began to scream hysterically and then I immediately woke up. Had some SP too.


Still had two hours of time to sleep so went back to sleep and this time I don't remember what made me lucid (dream is beginning to fade, I know I was playing video games with friends. It was a helicopter game and I was really bad at it.) but I do remember what happened next. I decided to fly. Seemed like a pretty common desire so why not. I started hovering above the ground over this big chain link metal fence. On the top I saw a toy stuffed monkey so I grabbed it. Then took off really high into the sky. Which everyone on this board says is awesome but I'm not going to lie, I thought the whole flying thing was sort of terrifying. So I decided to come down (even more terrifying I'm apparently not very good at flying). Ended up in a school yard. There were two young girls I decided I should give the monkey to one. So I  looked into their souls to determine which was good (weird thing to do). Ones face stayed the same and the others contorted into a maniacal grimace so I gave the monkey to the good kid.  Went inside the school which was actually a record shop/ book store. Then decided to change the whole dreams setting to one of the things I'd rather dream about. This was ineffective and I eventually woke up. But still I thought I did pretty well for my first lucid dream.


Still had like 30 minutes before I had to get ready for work so I went back to sleep. I started dreaming about a phone call. This was a very unformed dream, I couldn't tell where I was or what was going on other than just the feeling of the phone to my ear and the knowledge that the person on the other end was a curly red haired dude. Not sure how I knew that from his voice. He started to yell at me about some tough scheduling I have planned for later this week. Saying that I'd double booked something and what was I going to do now (typical stress dream) at first my none lucid self was upset and worried but then I thought, 'wait a second. I don't know this guy. How does he know my schedule. This doesn't makes sense. I must be dreaming"" So instead of responding about the current conversation I just said some nonsense words on the phone followed by ""You're not even real!"" He stammered ""W-w-what?!?"" As though he was really worried and then my alarm went off.


I think this was a huge step for me. So in summary.

I will just sit in my room, be walking down the street, whatever and I will try and convince myself that I am in a dream at that moment and that I can control things if I wanted to. I will think I am just tucked away in a part of my own mind, and everything around me is just my own minds creation. 

This works best on late night walks, or say all day research in a part of the library no one is in.

I feel this helps because it allows my brain to get use to the idea of being fully aware in my dreams.

At the very least it CERTAINLY helps for people in that stage of just starting to be lucid, but getting too excited and waking up. This makes the experience less ""exciting"" because you have already gone through these thoughts of excitement for what you COULD do. And you get it out of your system.

Additionally, astral projecting -- I'm fucking scared of it. I don't like it and make a point of not reading much about how to do it because I'm fucking afraid of it.

If it had not been for the incredible accounts of this sub, the plethora of information, and the constant ""yes, you can"" attitude, I would have never believed such things were possible for me. Thank you.

After performing the *Wake Back To Bed* method, I fell into two, quite vivid dreams (yes, one after the other). Both were relatively short and to the point. The third dream transitioned into existence with barely a thought to what had happened, as my dreams usually go. In reality, I work construction and in this dream that's where I was, at least what it felt like. Work. At work I run RC's every 15 minutes if I can and I believe the plot of this dream to be a huge factor in my lucidity. I was walking atop a scaffold highrise, some 10-15 ft off the ground. Before me lay what seemed to be the erecting of some sort of stadium with large concrete or stone pillars that loomed high in the sky. As I was walking through a small group of people (I'm guessing fellow workers as I really payed them no mind), I ran a reality check. I have a capital ""A"" written on my left hand in sharpie and in my dream it failed to appear. I ran another RC and again it failed to appear. The moment realization occurred, a rush of absolute excitement/euphoria ripped through my entire existence, physical and mental. Like I have read, I could feel my physical body in this transition from dream, to a lucid one. It was crazy but I would not let it distract me as I new what to do next. As the rush of emotion threatened to lift me from my newly found world, I grabbed some nearby scaffold with every ounce of strength I could exert, closed my eyes, and focused my mind into a whirlwind of concentration. It worked. A second later I opened my eyes to the same world lucidity had almost taken me from. I looked around for a moment, then commenced to erupt the stone pillars from the ground's grasp, and shatter them to gravel with just a thought. The people around me awed and exclaimed there excitement/terror at the events unfolding. I gave them no heed, for I was to live in this moment more than any other moment that preceded me. As I tried to fly, I felt heavy and dense (maybe something you can all relate to). But on a whim, I looked to the sky, stretched my hands out to become parallel to the ground like thrusters, and made a small pushing motion in which more force came from the mind than from my hands. I rocketed to a few hundred feet in seconds. I was amazed. Nothing like it. The feeling is forever locked into my emotional memory. I flew for miles at jetliner speed following an interstate below me. I had the idea to go faster, so I did. A lot faster. I broke the sound barrier on the first attempt with a body shattering 'CRACK'! I pushed faster and faster and soon I was flying with a speed that rivaled the SR-71. I soon came to the mind set that I wanted to go up and out of the Earth's atmosphere. I looked up and shot higher and higher. At about 10 miles above ground, I reached a kind of barrier. I would no longer go up, but to my astonishment, with every effort I made to accelerate upward I, in turn, was hurtling an Earth-sized body into our beloved home planet's atmosphere and within seconds, their crusts smashed and fused in a cataclysmic roar. They collided with intense destruction. Fire, boulders, lava, fissures, just absolute Armageddon. As the planets subsided to meld anymore, they resembled a Venn Diagram in shape. I felt somewhat guilty at the horrific event I had just witness, nonetheless created. I closed my eyes and envisioned a brand new Earth, and she was pristine when I opened my eyes. Lush and alive once more. I began to rebuild civilization when all of a sudden...


My fucking alarm. The method I used to gain lucidity left me about 90 minutes to dream. The first two dreams I had must have taken up most of my allotted time. But in any case, my life is eternally changed. It was a most memorable experience, and one I will work hard to achieve again. 

For all you interested in or actively partaking in Lucid Dreams, keep at it. It only gets better. I will answer any questions you may have, but in any case, good luck on your endeavors. Cheers

**TL:DR - [Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/gkBNw#0)**

Over the past few months I've been trying to learn how to lucid dream and a lot of the content here is incredibly helpful. However, I get lazy and end up with a scribbled journal that I can't really pull any information from.

This leads me to show you what I've been working on... A dream journal (web) app that focuses on being easy to use and easy to analyse (Yes - I know, I'm British).

Unfortunately, for the statistics page there are no screenshots right now due to it still being developed.

However, [here are a few screenshots of the web app so far](http://imgur.com/a/gkBNw#0) (these are not mockups, but actual working examples).

Some planned features for the future are

* ""trigger type"" - (WILD, MILD, etc.)
* ""location"" - (Home, Mars, etc.)
* ""characters"" - (Mum, Spaghetti-Arms, etc.)
* The ability to download your data (after all, it is **your data**) so you can keep your own backup or perform your own analysis of the data
* An API for developers to build their own apps and provide better integration with the other existing lucid dreaming apps

It's designed around being responsive so you can also use your desktop browser to view and have the exact same functionality as your phone does.

I'll also try to port this project into an android application so that you don't need to be connected to the internet all the time. Plus, some people (even myself, believe it or not) might be more comfortable with their data being kept offline and not in the cloud - that's fine too.

Anyway, I'm just posting this to see if there is any interest in me trying to release this project, or whether I should just keep it to myself.

Another thing I'd like to know is whether anyone would pay for this service (syncing to the ""cloud"", more advanced dream stats, etc.) and if so: how much should I charge for those who want more?

This morning I had to take a bus and go visit my mom for the day. I was up much earlier than I should have been, considering the sleep I got the night before, but I pressed on anyway. Didn't sleep on the bus, even though I felt sleep pulling desperately at my eyes the whole way. When I got to my mother's we both decided to take a nap and get more sleep. That is where things got interesting.

I must have interrupted my REM of course, because the speed at which I fell into dreams was incredible, I set a first alarm for 17 minutes, and think I had 2 or 3 dreams just in that time. One of them, however, was a false awakening, and this got me into the lucid dreaming mindset. Once I fell back asleep and set my alarm for more time is when I finally reached lucidity.

I woke up in my childhood home, walked a few steps, and saw my mom come down the stairs. Not unusual, but she was followed by another copy of herself. This tipped me off very quickly, but probably because of the false awakening before. From there on I was able to maintain over myself, but was powerless to control where events took me, simply adapting to the story as the scenes changed. Eventually it came to a party at my old house, and this was where I felt I had the most control up to that point. There was a particular girl there, and I decided to see how far a dream could go. We made out and started going further, but before anything could really happen an alarm went off again and I woke up.

The last time I fell asleep, again I was greeted to a false awakening. It's time, however, I was actually in the place I had been sleeping, so it took me longer to figure it out. But then I walked to the balcony, looked back on the barstools, and saw my dog, my cat, and my dog again. The double instance of my dog tipped me off, and it was in that moment I figured I had found one of my dream signs. I woke up a little after that, but altogether I had an incredible sleep, and it only took place over about an hour and a half or so. Even with that being the case, I find it amazing that I had so many dreams in such a short time, and that they could allow me to become lucid like they did.

I ran down the hallway while my mom was walking up it, said ""Mom,  I'm dreaming!"" and jumped off the balcony and flew off through the wall.

Kicked it for a bit.  Then I flew off and had a bunch of cool adventures. 

I was totally in control the whole time and the power became so natural that I kind of forgot I was dreaming, but still knew I was dreaming when I needed to. I was also 100% aware of all real world sounds like my brother breathing and waking up despite being deep in the dream.

* It's super comfortable. I had no trouble falling asleep in it at all.
* It will fit your head, 100%

So, now some bad things:

* The lights on the factory settings were bright. I mean, bright enough that I woke up every time I wore it, even on the lowest settings, which brings me to the next point...
* I tried making it less bright via [sleepwithremee.com/program](http://sleepwithremee.com/program), but it didn't make much of a difference (though, if someone could help me out, does turning the remee off after programing it reset it?)

Now, some good things:

* It is surprisingly easy to program the Remee. It took a few tries the first time, but after I figured out what I was doing, it was really simple
* Each night I wore the mask, after I had woken up, I went back to sleep and had incredibly, incredibly vivid dreams, and on one occasion even slipped into lucidity for a bit. I don't know if this is a result of Remee, or the fact that my REM cycle was interrupted.

I recently came across the subject and quickly began to become very interested in it.  Turns out, I have been experiencing Lucid Dreams for awhile now, and I would like to share with you how I first began Lucid Dreaming.

It all began when I was young (Currently 20), when the movie Toy Story first came to theaters.  In the dream, a blue colored skeleton man wearing a tuxedo and toupee showed up at my front door offering to sell my parents some magic powder.  I was pleading to my parents not to buy anything from him, but they did anyway saying that there was nothing wrong.  They then proceeded to put the magic powder on all of my stuffed animals and toys, giving them life.  After that, it was a fun dream for awhile, until all of the toys slowly started to change into blue skeletons and proceeding to chase me around the neighborhood, jumping me, and waking me up.

Now, I have read that one of the most important things to do to try and bring about lucid dreaming is to wright down your dreams as soon as you can in order to remember your dreams.  I have to say this is totally true, even if it sounds a little weird, because all my Lucid Dreaming began when that same dream randomly recurred to be in my early middle school years.  Once the dream came to the part were all the blue skeletons jumped me, I remembered that this was just a dream and had all the skeletons changed back into toys in an instant.  After that dream, I could tell just about every dream I had was a dream and began having lots of Lucid Dreams.

Now, this wasn't all because of that one event.  Growing up, I had always had a fascination with science and just random bits of information and facts.  This lead me to begin to know the deference between beliefs and facts earlier than most kids my age, which I believe lead me to become very suspicious of my own dreams.  I began doing a lot of reality checks in dream, and being I was in school most of the time, so was I in my dreams.  So a lot of my reality checks were just to break a school rule, and in a dream no one would care.  But the biggest thing that gave me the suspicion of being in a dream is that in every dream I have, the gravity is slightly off, being a little lighter than in reality.  That was, and still is, my dream sign, something that occurs in most if not every dream I have.  Having a dream sign sooo very much helps to being able continue to Lucid Dream.  It's like a guessing game/gambling with your dream and the dream sign is its tell.  

So anyway, after that most of the dreams I had became Lucid Dreams, and I can still remember many of them to this day.  I have many more experiences to share, having recently been informed of Lucid Dreaming, and realizing I had been doing this for most of my life. I do consider my self quite experienced, having gone through several MILDs and a few WILDs, which I will later have detailed posts about, as well as some very interesting semi-Lucid to very Lucid Dreams I think someone might enjoy.

So after that I realized I was dreaming and had magical fun time adventures, right? **Wrong**.

I take prescription Adderall and Focalin during the week, and sometimes I'll go through some very minor withdrawal symptoms over the weekends. One of these symptoms is really weird, it's called [""Brain Shivers""](http://lifestyle.iloveindia.com/lounge/what-are-brain-shivers-5248.html) or brain zaps. They can be describes as a weird feeling in the head kind of like a ""swoosh,"" or the brain refocusing. They aren't painful or annoying, in fact I kind of like them, they're just stimulating like someone flicking your brain to pay attention. These aren't serious at all and almost never happen to me during the day. They happen usually right before I go to bed, and shortly after, and for some reason only happen when I don't sleep in my own bed.  So last night the stars aligned and I got a brain zap just before falling asleep. Ignoring it, I fell asleep minutes after only to reawaken after yet another brain zap. Whenever I wake up to a brain zap it always puts me into SP, but like always, I broke out of it and tried to go back to sleep. But this time, I was fully aware that I was asleep, something that has never happened to me. I don't remember much of it, but I do remember that I did a RC where I held my nose shut and I could still breathe. I remember not really having much control and it felt almost like a normal dream, nothing special. I tried other things like flicking a light switch on and off (which didn't work - the lights turned on and off normally) and I'm pretty sure I lost lucidity, but later looked at a mirror and saw something scary and woke up, ending the control of the dream completely. 

Anyway, the morning after that I was woken up by family members and went to another room to sleep. And somehow I was able to know I was in a dream yet again but with no help. I didn't do an RC, I didn't have any brain shivers, I don't remember why I knew I saw dreaming. Well that dream I remember a lot more, and I had a little bit more control. I didn't do anything fancy, I just teleported to some hilly roads and spawned some of my friends and went longboarding, but I didn't lose lucidity because I was able to teleport myself back up hills instead of walking back up.

EDIT: Now that this post is slightly getting attention, I'd like to ask if anybody else has experienced these brain shivers. They are quite unusual. I'm thinking that they might have to do with caffeine withdrawal, in that case then I used a legitimate technique called CWILD or caffeine withdrawal induced lucid dream. Apparently it's the easiest technique with 100% chance to LD if you do it right, I'd look it up.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,1369722805.0,,,True,t3_1f67nr,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1f67nr/i_did_you_guys_its_been_years_since_ive_started/,

I notice a metallic chair that is not in it's place, I look into the reflection off one of it's legs and I can see some creature moving in it. At this point I'm so scared that there was no other option for me but to look at what was touching me (like it's pretty irrational to be this afraid of something touching you). I struggled so hard to turn my body, and as I broke from the paralysis... I wake up. Pretty shaken after this and my idiot mind is racing trying to put a demon face to the creature I think I saw touching me. Like the sensation might just have been my own hand on my shoulder (because I sleep scrunched up sometimes).

Next to seeing small aliens or large multi-legged bugs in my room as a child and thinking they were real, this comes in as about as terrifying an experience..

tldr : Awake from a quaint dream into another dream mimicking reality. Become lucid as things don't add up. Something starts touching me, attempt to catch a glimpse but ""lag"" like sleep paralysis keeps me from it. By lag I mean I can move like 3cm, then it teleports me back. Fight with all might, break dream. Mind instantly jumps to conclusion : DEMONS, yeah right... such irrational fear..

For example, I once had a lucid dream where I was with a quite attractive girl in my bedroom. I noticed that the door was open, and obviously I wanted to close it so I did (with my dream powers). Then I noticed she had a bit of food on her mouth, so I tried to remove it unfortunately I destroyed her face in the process and she changed into demon which I subsequently had to kill (bummer).

Flying on the other hand requires no such control. The scenery below you is constantly changing as you are in motion, it is more a path of observation than control. This is why I think so many lucid dreamers fly.

I've tried everything from WILD, MILD, FILD, Dream Journals but nothing worked. There were some close calls but no progress. I just had one just now, if you guys could help me pinpoint what triggered it then it would really help me and others out there! So here it is in full detail. 

I awoke in a theater on a futon where my family, friends and teachers were celebrating something. The theater was an old greek styled stone theater(Not an amphitheater, but more smaller), Next to my futon was a can of root beer. As I got up, I picked up the can of root beer, closed my eyes and drank it. To which I was suddenly at my mom's room where my Parents and my sister in law was there. I don't know why but at that moment, I did a Reality Check by grabbing my nose and breathing in. I realised that I'm actually breathing in, so to confirm this I quickly take a look at my left hand and saw an extra finger between my middle and ring finger. I was definitely in a dream!

I got so excited that the dream was collapsing. I felt dizzy and my vision was all wavy, I remembered the advice that you guys gave many others and started to spin around until the dizziness and my vision became normal. To which my parents asked me what was I doing. I reminded my self to not be overexcited and decided to experiment in this world by trying to control it. My first choice was to change the scene into a paradise with women in bikinis running around. I closed my eyes and reopened them but I was still in my mom's room. Ok... I guess I need more practice. Then I decided to change something into something else. There was a blue basket on my mom's make-up table(no idea why) which I had an idea to try and change it into an apple. I extended my arms as if I had super powers an tried to bend it to my will. The basket slowly start melt and manipulated into a whitish-grey ball. Then I tried to reshape it to look like an apple but my mind slipped and I turned it into sliced rotten apple instead. I tried turning it back but it disappeared...

It seems during the process of morphing a small boy with the resemblance of Julius Caesar spawned behind me. He said that he wanted to play games which my mom told me to entertain him. I turned on a console that looks something like the N64 and started to play a multiplayer 8-bit game. My mom told me to go easy on the kid because I was pwning the kid into oblivion. To be fair, he was a brat... He then proceeded to cry and my mom took him out of the room to get Ice-cream. So now it's just me and my sister-in-law in the room.

I continued to play games while chatting with my sister. I then told her ""Y'know, this is actually just my dream. You're not even real."" Then I realised what I just did and suddenly  appeared and the lights went out except the TV which now just shows the blue screen. My sister just sat down on the floor staring straight ahead. What have I done... I walked towards her and took out my flashlight and shone it on her face. Her eyes were widened and he mouth was smiling ear to ear. It was creepy as hell. I then immediately spawned two katanas with a white hilt and red wrappings and prepared my self for what ever lurks in the shadows, I then heard a growl behind me.

I then rubbed my hands together and everything became super vivid. I also span around a few times whilst rubbing hands but it didn't make it more vivid by spinning, it just felt bad. 


Then I decided I wanted to sit down for a bit to just relax/meditate or whatever, observe surroundings.
I think I was in London.

Then, just as I sat down with those intentions, I suddenly got woken up by my Dad telling me I was late, when in fact I had 3 hours before I needed to go to college. He thought it was Friday...


This was my first lucid dream in months, so, as you can imagine I'm very annoyed at my Dad!


For those interested I had had 1 Kirkland sleep aid, 1 banana, cheese on 2 crackers, and 1 multivitamins pastel the night before, this dream being about 8 hours after taking them, so about 7 hours of sleep, this may or may not have influenced my dream.


I also had Dreamz iOS app on with in- ear headphones with Sleepstream2 also playing white noise almost on minimum volume, along with deepspace ambient and deep sleep binaural beats on higher volume, but I don't recall hearing any, or incorporation of the music in my dreams or the Dreamz sound.

In conclusion, 
when you are lucid, you should **rub your hands together** after looking at them and counting your fingers. By doing this you will either have weird numbers of fingers or just be very aware you are asleep because it feels very different to reality. 


By rubbing hands together the dream will get more vivid. Other things may work better for other people, but for me this works.

A lucid dream is simply a dream, any dream, in which you recognize that it's a dream. That's it! Nothing more! If you say to yourself something like ""Wow, cool, this is a dream!"", then it's a lucid dream. It doesn't matter if you wake up right away. It doesn't matter if you can or can not control anything. It doesn't matter what does or does not happen afterwards. If you simply, even for a moment, recognize the fact that it's a dream, then you had a lucid dream. 

However, that does not mean it will stay a lucid dream. A lucid dream can easily turn into a non-lucid one, if you forget that it's a dream. This is because lucidity, by definition, is simply being aware. If you become aware of this, then you had a lucid dream.

Also, lucidity is not like a on/off switch where there is either full blown lucidity or nothing. That isn't how it works. It works more like a dimmer switch in that the light can be dimly lit, brightly lit or any variations in between. If there is any light at all, even if it's very dim, you can still rightly call it a lucid dream. :)",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_teote,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/teote/did_i_have_a_lucid_dreamanswered/,

As I was going to sleep, I was trying to visualize a dreamscape. When the SP came, it was a strange feeling, I may have even slept through the transition only to wake during it. At first I tried to move with all my might, but couldn't. Then I tried to call for my wife to wake me, but couldn't. Realizing from all my LD research that there was nothing I could do about it, I decided not to worry about it (since it is not something to worry about) and to just go for the WILD.

After a short while of trying to visualize a dream scene (not just the image, but the experience over time), the dream came in to view. This whole process was a bit of an accident, but I am glad to say that my first experience with SP was not a big deal. It did kinda freak me out at first, but after thinking about what was actually going on, I was fine with it. I am kinda sad now that I didn't try to stay in SP for longer to really analyze the experience. I have been thinking a lot lately about how while the waking reality you experience is really there, what you are actually experiencing is an accurate construct of your brain built from sensory input. That is the basis of lucid dreaming right? To experience reality constructed from nothing but your brain, then maybe control it? What you should really take away from this is that SP is not scary and should not deter you from trying to lucid dream.

TL;DR - Experienced SP and it was not scary at all.

About a year ago from now, I started taking fish oil (~1000mg) everyday for its proposed health benefits. Whatever, that doesn't matter. One night I decided to take fish oil before going to bed, and the next morning I remembered having a very vivid dream. Naturally, I did not really think of my dreaming as resulting from the fish oil. For whatever reason, I kept taking the fish oil before I went to bed, and kept having vivid dreams. I became aware of the correlation, but could not explain to myself (or anyone else) the causation. Furthermore I was able to develop my lucid dreaming skills much more proficiently. But... I wasn't about to tell other people to pop pills before they went to sleep to lucidly dream (at least at that time...).

A few months ago, I ran out of fish oil and was too lazy to go out and get more. Furthermore, the Internet was not giving me any solid results, published articles, etc. So, I eventually shrugged off the correlation as I could not prove it. 

About a week ago, however, I started taking fish oil again (for whatever reason) in the morning and at night, and bam I start vividly dreaming at night with a 100% correlation between taking the fish oil before I sleep and lucidly dreaming. Now I can't let this go. Which is why I am here writing this. Looking at some websites (unfortunately none of them especially credible), some people have claimed that the fish oil helps in dream vividness and recall. I found this interesting, but yet again there does not seem to be any real study on the subject (or at least I have not found it).

I highly recommend trying this for those who are interested in vivid or lucid dreaming. I'm also very curious if anyone else has had this experience, or if anyone can point me to some solid research findings on the correlation. I haven't seen any posts on this subject on /r/LucidDreaming, so I thought I'd at least let others know.

I was out at a bar, I think it may have been for my friend kelsies 21st.  I managed to get a little alone time with her out the front of a bar,  it was a local bar, but was facing the wrong direction. Not into anything in particular. Everything was facing the wrong direction. It was like I could feel where north was and everything that would face north was facing south and the same with all the other points of the magnet.

Kelsie opened up to me about a really shitty relationship that she had that lasted five weeks, I didn't take much interest. I had a hand on her bum cheek underneath her mini skirt, after she hugged me and thrust her pelvis up and into me. It reminded me of a dream I had about another girl the previous night... while I was dreaming

 I felt a very connected to her. Quite attracted really. We then continued inside together and she chatted to some people behind the bar and started her working shift? I thought this was her party? Obviously not.

 I continued around the bar looking for some people I knew, I kept passing a gentleman that looked vaguely familiar, we would lock eye contact and I would always think no… It can’t be. Continuing around I run into a good mate, Ben who introduces me to a couple of friends I know from way back in high school.
 I need to go to the toilet, so excuse my self from the table. I pass the gentleman from before again who still looks vaguely familiar; he seems to be the centre of attention in a group of people. I continue onto the toilet but before making it double back in the realization that the man is actually looks like a mirror image of myself. I greet him and tell him how he looks like me.

He agrees

I am overjoyed and comment how he could be my twin and if he actually is me.

He looks perplexed and tells me that he is actually me. As if I should not even be questioning the fact.

Suddenly a whole story clicks into my memory, that one of us exists out of some time travel anomaly yet I was unsure which one of us had actually travelled in time.

I notice that the voice of my other self is a lot deeper then I assumed my own was and that my complexion a lot smoother, even though we are wearing the same outfit he seems to fit his better. His hair more stylish then I think mine is. I instantly take a liking to him… myself?  
I put my arm around his shoulder and drag him away from his group of friends without even noticing them. I think I assumed he was by himself. We both walk back to where ben was sitting with the old high school friends. Introducing him as my time travel brother I pull him out a seat next for myself and I, remembering that I needed to go to the toilet still, I once again leave. Time passes quickly and I have an overwhelming feeling that my other self is not enjoying the situation. 

I had a feeling that these people at the table embodied all the people that surround me in my life in my current situation. I never really liked the high school friends at the table and held little respect for them in general. The feeling I felt about the friends at the table, the dislike, the disinterest. All suddenly became a feeling I felt for every friend I could think of. 

Quickly hurrying back I find that no one was talking to each other, my other self seemed to be in a state of depression, along with the other solemn people around the table, my so called friends not at all impressed that there was two of me. If anything annoyed by it. 

Dragging him away from the emotionally draining situation, I seem to end up following him, to a corner table. A high table surrounded by a leather circular bench seat, covered in drinks and filled with laughing, positive feeling people. 
He introduces me to a girl who hugs me warmly, I don’t recognize her. I feel very attracted to her though. Apparently she is ""me's"" girlfriend. 

It clicks. 

All the people around the table and my other self,  they all had this feeling attached to them. Something along the lines of a humble greatness. As if they were looking at me as a child that they were willing to teach. Not looking down on me, treating me as an inexperienced yet somehow equal person.
I had an urge to impress them. All night I had that urge to impress people. Impressing my other self seemed of top priority. I was a little frustrated because he seemed so blasé about meeting me. 

The conversation continued on between all of us. I began to come upon the realization that my other self was just me if I acted more like the person I really wanted to be deep down. At some point he had taken a different path in his life and was actually a completely different person. He seemed disappointed in me, unimpressed with the boasting of the things I had achieved in my life, and started giving me advice, telling me to drink more goon(Australian cheap wine) and slide down hills on mattresses. 

Have more fun.
Make more friends. 
Be a kinder, more understanding person.

 He seemed to have an insight into me. Well of course... he was me... I rebutted saying how much I have already accomplished in my life, he listened and agreed. Humble enough to smile and act congratulatory on my behalf. Yet seemed to have a look on his face, like someone holding a wounded bird they found under a tree. Far from in good condition but with enough care and guidance would be ok again in the future. No it was different. the look was saying to me. Yes, you have done some great things. To other people, they are amazing things. Is that the best you can do though? Look where you are tonight. Look where I am. Who is in a better position? You’re surrounded by old friends you have nothing in common with. I am surrounded by a group of friends I am sharing life with. I am enjoying, I am laughing, I am happy. Is what  his look told me. Finally with absolute clarity, from the laughter lines around his eyes to each and freckle. The glint in his eyes and the hap hazard posture of confidence and self comfort. It came crashing upon me the fact that. I was not. I was not happy indeed.

Do something about it he whispered.

He wasn’t criticizing me, far from it. He was just telling me, that I can try harder and live more than I am now. To be honest, as I was sitting there, on what I remember to be a chair shorter than all the others, I aspired to be like him(myself) and have friends like him. In hindsight, he kept taking on a persona of an old friend I don't have much contact with now days. I’m not completely sure why.

I woke up with these quotes in my head that I knew I had read somewhere. 

“Man is only truly great when he acts from his passions.”

“The ultimate is not to win, but to reach within the depths of your capabilities and to compete against yourself.”

I am still unsure whether this man, that was I, was me in the past, an alternate present, or the future. Does it matter though? I feel the message was sent fairly clear. After waking from the dream though, he has inspired me. Inspired me to not just float through life but to actually ""Live"". Live it with aspirations that if I ever do meet myself in a dream again. We will be sitting on a chair of equal height. That he will smile at me and nod. A gesture that he accepts who I am.

One should not live his life trying to be accepted by others, his friends, family or strangers. Live life with passion, live it so that you are accepted by yourself. Live it, so that if you were to ever meet yourself, you would be proud of them.

Truly I have never woken up with such a weight lifted off me and such a feeling of well-being. Give me more dreams like that!

After using it for about 2 days I managed to have a brief moment of lucidity. 

In a dream last night I found myself in a war stricken area, somewhere in the middle east. It was horrible living conditions and there was constant threat of gunfire in the streets. I found myself looking for supplies in an abandoned shack. I suddenly hear something approaching and and a legless man was advancing toward me on the ground holding a knife. *Fuck*.

Because of my constant reality checking during waking life, It was instinctual to look at my hands. Of course when I did this they were blurry and slightly deformed. I then knew this was a dream. I looked at the knife wielding man, I smiled at him and he smiled back. I turned my head upward to the ceiling and formed an energy field around my feet. I shot through the roof just as I woke up. 

Remember to never asume you are awake, especially during reality checks. Try and always treat your environment like you're in a dream, *until proven wrong*. Good luck and say hi to your mum for me.

But I figured out a way to help alleviate them without breaking the not-moving streak. Since the body's symmetrical, when you get an itch, normally you have a non-itching, mirrored counterpart to the afflicted region. For instance, your left cheek itches, your right doesn't. I find intensely focusing on the calmness of the non-afflicted side can often remove the itch on the itching side. So if my left cheek itches, I focus on my right cheek, it's relaxedness and soothedness, and I tend to stop noticing the itch on my left cheek.

So you're able to have lucid dreams from time to time. You're able to keep being lucid for a bit. Then what? What do you plan to do?

I'm a dream enthusiast and I've been lucid dreaming for a year. It's amazing stuff, to be able to enter a world where ANYTHING is possible.

Over the year I've read tons of articles on this subject. Our abilities in our dreams are limited by our imaginations. When we are born, we have no knowledge about the logic and physics of the world. Back then, our dreams would've been crazy! Growing up, you learn all sorts of rules and ""impossibles,"" which you incorporate into your dream world.

This sucks because we're making our dream world a copy of our waking world, which is BORING! Over the year, I've been trying to learn to do ""impossibles"" in my dreams, so that I can gain more control and break free from the rules I've subconsciously set for myself. Here are some things I always try, and have tons of fun when I actually manage it:

- Harry Potter
 - MAGIC! Find a wand (a stick or any long thing that resembles a wand) and flick it around, but make sure you're EXPECTING to see sparks! Try spells too. Start from simple ones like Lumos
 - FLYING! Find a broomstick, get on it and kick off! Remember, the broomstick is magical. You don't need to exert effort to stay afloat. REMEMBER THAT!
 - ""apparating"", or teleporting by spinning
- Avatar
 - Water bending! This is the easiest for me. I can also freeze water now and make rain swirl over my head. Try freezing the surface of a pond and then go skating. I think water will be the easiest for everyone because it is a visible substance and we can move water easily in reality.
 - Fire bending. Start small. Focus on your palm and try to make a fireball appear first, then work your way up
 - Earth bending. I haven't been able to do this yet, but if you master it I think it would be super fun. You could try tunnelling underground or try on a flying rock. The one time I tried it I hit my hand on the solid cliff and felt pain...
 - Air bending. You can knock people/things back, and you also fly and create wind and tornados. I have trouble with this as well, I think because air is invisible to us in reality. 
- Dragonball
 - Shoot energy balls!!
 - Fly!!! Try flying on a nimbus too.
 - power up!

Dreams are easier to control if you believe in it wholeheartedly. My little brother, after me just telling him that lucid dreaming was possible, had one the very night. 
 
The things I listed above are the things I believe in! If you like some other fandom, try things from your anime/show/book! If you have no idea what Avatar is, the things I wrote probably wouldn't work for you.

Also, make sure you BELIEVE that you can do these things! Believe that when you try to fly, you WILL fly. Remember what the characters in the stories do to use those abilities. If you watched dragonball Z, remember how Gohan taught Pan how to fly!

Some generic things to try are:

- flying
- sex, of course. Sometimes it feels really real
- teleporting
- mind controlling people. I never tried this, but what I usually do to make people in my dreams behave the way I want is to PRETEND something is happening. For example, if I want people to evacuate a building I will PRETEND that there is a huge fire. People in my dreams will believe what I want them to believe, even if I don't see any fire in my dream.
- telekinesis...focus on an object to try to move it
- meet the deceased. Always nice to see your dead relatives/friends
- talk to your subconsciousness. Conjure up something that represents who you are, and ask it questions about yourself. I'm too scared to try this...
- Meet living people of course! I'm long distance with my SO so I try to meet him in my lucid dreams =) The hugs sometimes feel very real!

Well I've been blabbing on far too long. I want to hear what you like to do in YOUR lucid dreams! I want more ideas! Please tell me your stories and any tips for how you can achieve them!

Blew my mind!,GlumKantaloupe,99,32,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1ezd7s/wasnt_even_trying_to_and_had_3_consecutive_lucid/,"I finally know what all the hubbub is about. This lucid dreaming stuff is incredible! It is an experience unlike any other, regardless of whether or not you do cool shit in the lucid dream at all!

Anyway, I didn't get good sleep at all last night/this morning, only about 3 hours. I woke up and ate something, used the bathroom, etc. and about an hour later I decided to lay back down and make up the lost hours. I dozed off very fast and was straight into a dream, one that was not lucid. Some odd things happened in this dream but eventually that dream sequence ended.

I was then shot into a **second dream** with similar characters but a different scenario. Odd things happen again with the same characters, and I think that is what prompted me to do my reality check. I was then quite lucid and stabilized the dream by rubbing my hands together like I've been reading about. The dream only lasted about 3 - 5 minutes. I tried to do sexual stuff (yeah, yeah, I know =P lol) and got too excited and woke up. Oddly enough, I was trying to have sex with my *girlfriend* in the dream, someone I have sex with all the time, but the dream just made it that much more exciting! Probably because I imagined all the things that would be possible in the dream world...

Okay, the **third dream** followed a similar suit: weird happenings with similar characters, prompted to do a reality check, stabilize. This dream lasted about 3 - 5 minutes as well. Nothing really eventful, just some exploring (which was still AMAZINGLY cool for my first time!)

The **fourth dream** -- my third lucid -- was the most interesting. It happened to last the longest as well, about 10 minutes or so. What was peculiar about the dream was that I didn't reality check for any specific reason. Immediately as the dream started, I think my dream self was used to performing reality checks from the past two dreams and immediately just did one. I stabilized, and this dream was incredibly vivid. I am going to post my entry from my dream journal on my phone. Please mind some of the spelling and grammar, as I use Siri for my entries. It was so damn cool for me!

&gt;I am in my house kind of just walking around. Nothing really prompts me to do a reality check, but I think because of my past two dreams I simply did one. Boom, I am lucid again and stabilize once more by rubbing my hands together. This time I really calm myself down, and take a moment to take in the dream. I look around my living room and it's so vivid and it looks exactly like my living room in real life. It's very bright inside, probably the middle of the day. I decide to walk outside on my porch but the moment I do, it becomes rainy and gloomy but not necessarily dark. It is so detailed I see all the rain droplets, the clouds in the sky, and the lake and pool space in its entirety.

&gt;Being outside, I decide to try and fly, but all that happened was I jump really high up and fall to the ground. As I hit the pavement, instead of contacting it hard, I fall through it and make a splashing sound. The pavement was water. I fall through it straight to an exact position in the air where I was before and landed on my feet. (Felt like something that would happen if you could travel through mirrors like at the end of *Mirrors* with Kiefer Sutherland.) I keep trying to fly to no avail and was just jumping high. I try to jump onto my roof but am not able to. As I try all of this, my mom comes out and notices that I am trying to fly and tries to fly as well. She is not able to do it either (Interacting with dream family members is weird by the way). I then grab this bright red pool sifting device on the ground and try to use it as a broom thinking that maybe the dream would interpret that and let me fly like a wizard, but nothing happens. 

&gt;After I fail at flying, I walk around the right side of my house under the big tree and all of a sudden it was nighttime. It was weird because I was totally conscious of everything I was doing but the environment was changing at will. There at the end of the parking space section near the garage, I see a black haired girl in a crouched ball leaning over crying. I think she is one of the witches from Left For Dead but I still try to talk to her. As I approach her she gets up and is actually completely friendly, but still tries to chase me with the speed that the witches do in Left For Dead. I notice she is in a bikini and realize she is quite attractive. I decide to try and make things sexual and attempt to seduce her. After a while of trying, and failing, I end up waking myself.

&gt;AWESOME SHIT MAN!

I didn't try to use any method in particular, but maybe someone can tell me exactly why these lucid dreams came so easily and were so vivid? Was it because I was so tired? Were they simply the right dreams at the right time? Was this kind of like a WILD (even though I didn't have sleep paralysis)?

Sorry if all this comes off as rambling. It is just very exciting and I can't wait to have more lucid dreams!

I'm a frequent poster and visitor to /r/luciddreaming, but too many people IRL know my username, so an anonymous post it is.

* Day 1: Blueberry; terrible recall, almost no memory of even dreaming

* Day 2: Jack Herrer; slept through the night, remember still images from my dreams but mostly just disassociated feelings that I was asleep and stuff happened

* Day 3: mixed bowl + full dropper of oral tincture; slept like a log, no recall

* Day 4: Golden Goat; all night dream, lots of detail, very intense - I was fully aware I was dreaming but unable to wake myself up from within the dream, so **lucidity achieved**

* Day 5: Pit Bull; another all night dream, less ability to recall but what I was able to recall was very vivid

* Day 6: Super Silver Haze; my first apocalyptic dream in awhile, much sadder theme than usual in my dreams; fair recall and vibrant visuals

* Day 7: Ace of Spades; another all-night dream, very chaotic and jumbled visuals and plot, limited recall upon waking

I have come to the personal conclusion that marijuana itself does not determine your ability to recall or dream lucidly, but it is possibly dependent in the strain.

I was amazed with how realistic and real it felt. It was really hard to get out of bed but i finally did and when walking out the door i thought ""if this is a dream, I'll walk into Lambeau Field"" (Packer fan).  Sure enough i open my front door and Lambeau Field is in the middle of my street.  Not quite what i wanted but I figured I'd check it out. So I tried to fly over for an aerial view.  I just did like a Mario jump with my one fist in the air and I took off. Flying was really hard but i was able to stay suspended in the air and hover over the field. Getting down was really hard but I finally came down and decided to try to make stuff appear. I remember wanting a light saber and at the last second a Viking Sword and as i did like a sword swing I had a sword in my hand.  Crazy stuff.  I then made a black Lamborghini by doing the same thing saying ""if this is a dream then i want a black lamborghini"".  I got in and floored it and anything that got in my way I could wipe away with my hand like i was magneto. It was the most amazing dream i've ever had and i cant wait to try again tonight.

I partially woke up at around 1 pm in a sleepy haze and decided that it would be a great idea to try the WILD method, something people told me was not the best idea for beginners. Even though I had my best results with WILD, things got bad pretty quickly. 

When I first entered the dream it was as if I was looking down at some sort of crappy arcade game. There was a large pixelated spiked wooden wall much like the wall that surrounds Orc forts in Skyrim. I was apparently in charge of the gate and let pixelated legions of blobs pass through the gate. Without a reality check or any other sort of lucid dreaming tool, I just remembered that I was trying to WILD and ditched the gatekeeping job to blow up said blobs with my mind because why not, I'm dreaming. The dream then began to become increasingly realistic as if an atari game aquired ps3 graphics. The blobs also became increasingly hostile to my psychic explosions and developed only into what I can describe as mushroom headed Vileplumes (a pokemon with a flower head). They started screaming and one of them gave me the most satanic look I have ever seen. At that moment I also felt my body sleeping in my bed tense up breathe hard. Unable to escape the soul penetrating look of the demented pokemon, I tried to yell at them ""THIS IS A DREAM, I AM THE ONLY REAL ONE HERE"" as mentioned in another thread on this subreddit. Unfortunately, this only aggravated them so I forced my eyes open only to fall off my bed and abruptly terminate my dream.

Anyway my question is whether its normal to have such a weird 1st lucid dream? ",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_w20wl,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/w20wl/a_ld_at_last/,

Second, I don't have any experience from Lucid Dreaming, so I started right away with trying to WILD, and since then I started to remember my dreams, and even be half-Lucid (knowing you're in a world, awake, but not in control and not aware of dreaming).

So i'm getting further and further with WILD, and i'm to the part where you feel you're upside down, sideways, or totally mangled like someone hit by a bus laying on the ground (without the pain), while you're laying comfortably in bed. It's only that i'm getting distracted by the fact that i'm trying to WILD (ironic, isn't it).

So, before I enter the stage where you start spinning like a madman, and your body is falling asleep, i've felt every time this sensation in my lower stomach, my hearth raced, started breathing heavily. First few times I was like ""What the hell is happening? :|""

Today, tired as hell, I just dump myself on my bed, lie there, completely still, trying to WILD as i'm just relaxing. And again, i started that sensation ever earlier. Ofcourse, i'm a guy, and think of sex now and then (duh). Once i figured out and co-related everything to that sensation (which is quite easy to know, somehow difficult to execute), i'm now able to feel this about within 30 seconds of laying down, or sitting down.

What it is? It's my prostate. After a few great minutes I got the urge to pee. I went to the toilet, but it wouldn't. Managed to get a few drops out, and noticed it's precum.

If there is enough interest I could document it, as i'm finding out more by trying this. Basically the same as a wet dream, but awake. I would like to call it Wake Induced Wet Dream Orgasm (or something along these lines).

TL;DR Attempts at WILD. Feel sensation in lower stomach, turns out it was my prostate and know how to stimulate it by lying down like a deadman, not moving a muscle. WIWDO'ed",,True,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_uq3xa,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/uq3xa/fun_sideeffect_of_wild/,

1371029900.0,63,self.LucidDreaming,1g6q7t,I've experienced sleep paralysis before but it was never as terrifying as it was last night.,classysince1897,76,13,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1g6q7t/ive_experienced_sleep_paralysis_before_but_it_was/,"Sorry this is going to be a long one, but I need to get it off my chest and written down even if no one reads this. 

First of all, I always know when I'm in a dream, I've just always been like that, a lot of them I can control but on occasions when I can't the characters in my dreams tell me I can't change the scene because there is something important I'm supposed to learn from it.  Usually I'm fairly good at interpreting my dreams in those cases, what things in my life that may have cause the dreams.  Last night however I experienced the most horrifying nightmare I've ever had in my life, I couldn't go back to sleep after waking up at 3:30 in the morning, and I don't know what to make of it. 

So I was falling asleep when suddenly I became horribly aware that while my body was falling asleep my mind was still awake and alert.  In the darkness of my room is felt something move toward me, it creeped up slowly, I did my best to ignore it aware of what was happening, but I was powerless to stop it, it climbed into bed with me and  got on top of me.  It was a male figure, while it was to dark to distinguish, it had the build of my boyfriend.  I wanted it to just be my boyfriend, so I said his name and he whispered ""mhhm"" in my ear before starting to kiss my neck and fondle me.  But as much as I wanted it, I knew it wasn't my boyfriend, I knew it was evil, and more than anything I knew I didn't want to see it. Suddenly it crawled off of me, I realized I must have fallen asleep completely which means I could probably make myself move. 

Climbing out of bed was hard my legs felt heavy and slow, but I managed to get up, I struggled my way over to the door.  I felt the thing creeping up behind me, laughing at me.  I was terrified but tried to remain as calm as possible, still calling it by my boyfriends name, allowing it to think it was deceiving me, but in my mind I was angry that this hideous thing was taking the form of a person I love.  I was trying to get to the light I wanted to see it and face it, I was about to flip the switch when it attacked me, it wouldn't allow me to turn on any lights. I fought and struggled with it.  It hissed at me, and told me I couldn't escape him.  I told him all I needed to do to escape him was to survive until I wake up.  He told me if you wake up.  I smacked myself hard and screamed at myself to wake up. I did, and the thing was gone.

I jumped up and ran down the hall to my grandparents room, I tried to wake them up and tell them I had just had a horrible nightmare, but my speech was slurred and strained, some of the words were barely whispers and I knew then I was still trapped in my nightmare.  As soon as I realized this my grandmother sat up and smiled at me, but of course it wasn't my grandmother, it was the thing in my room that was pretending to be my boyfriend.  I prepared myself to fight it again, I began to pray, suddenly I could see the demon more clearly, it looked like a mix between some kind of hoofed animal and a rotting human corpse.  I realized I had seen this thing before, in a dream I had years ago in high school, at that time however it had failed to scare, me I remembered like that night it had crawled through the dark and up into my bed but on that occasion, I had sat up, looked it in the eye and said ""you might as well go back to whatever hell hole you came out of, cause I don't have time for this shit"" it crawled away and that was the end of that dream.  I informed the demon that it would be just as powerless this time to hurt me, because this was my dream and I would not be made to feel like a victim in my own mind. It just laughed at me and told me I was stupid, and I was dealing with things beyond my understanding. I kept praying, reciting the lords prayer, never backing away, always looking directly at it. Pretending I wasn't terrified. I don't know why I was praying, or why that gave me such comfort, in real life I had left the Catholic church when I was 12 and haven't put much stock in religion since then.  But my appeals to god, to jesus, to anything good and kind in the world was keeping the demon at bay, though it fought to get at me. 

My grandmother disappeared, I thought it was over. But I turned around and it was now in my grandfather.  He mocked me. Then suddenly he turned young, and transformed back into my boyfriend, he was beautiful.  Somehow I knew it was almost over that I would wake up soon. So I got into bed with it and asked if he wanted to have sex, he said yes, and I had sex with it calling it grandpa (in real life I call my grandfather papa) I didn't actually want to be doing this I just wanted to kill time before I woke up, and I'd rather have a weird sex dream than a terrifying nightmare.  But I couldn't feel anything while it was having sex with me and it only lasted a minute before the thing came and got tired and collapsed next to me, I tried to get it to do it again but it got angry and suspicious with what I was doing and turned back into the monster it really was. I began to pray again as it closed in on me, I prayed loudly with a conviction, I was angry that this thing thought it could over power me and I was determined to destroy it. Suddenly my words were choked off as I began to vomit, then the vomit turned to water, I was just spewing water out of my mouth at this thing, and it began to scream and writhe and smoke as if being burned by acid.  It looked up at with me with my boyfriends eyes as if it was trying to gain my sympathy and stop, but I only stopped for a second to say ""yeah, holy water bitch!"" then I kept spraying it till it was gone.  I walked back to my own room closed the door and climbed into bed.  As soon as I closed my eyes I woke up for real.

1357935126.0,64,self.LucidDreaming,16eaj0,Today I opened my eyes during SP and time traveled (so to speak)...  Please read further!,Vinzent,83,19,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/16eaj0/today_i_opened_my_eyes_during_sp_and_time/,"Hello everyone. Sorry for the length. I'm a new poster here on /LucidDreaming.  I have been having lucid dreams for a few years now.  I've started naturally and found out lucid dreaming was actually a thing so I started reading literature and have more control now.

**My situation:**  Today I took a quick nap after doing some light meditating (around 1 hour) and when I woke up I laid there for a while, eyes closed.  I had some soft music playing and could hear it getting louder along with the ringing in my ears.  Now this has happened to me before; I knew I was about to go into SP.  Sometimes I open my eyes accidentally during it.  Anyways, for me, the ringing gets really loud and then theres a ""pop"" and I can feel my whole body make that quick transition from 'awake' to 'sleep mode'. Mind you I was very conscious at this point. 

That's when I opened my eyes. I'm used to seeing things by now when I open my eyes, it doesn't scare me.  Sometimes it will be moving objects or shadows or what not.  Most of the time when I wake from SP I realize those things were usually just objects in my room (chair, desk, hanging towel, etc.).  This time was different however.  When I opened my eyes I was in a completely different room, no moving objects or weird shadows or noises; the ringing in my head stopped and my body felt completely awake.  I felt normally awake.

The music had gone away completely and it was just a quiet like on a summer night.  This freaked me out a bit but what freaked me out more was the fact that I didn't wake up from the shock of it.  Then I started to notice how realistic everything seemed to be.  Usually in my LDs things have a slight haze, like everything is a shade softer.  This room was crystal clear and my mind was racing.  Then I suddenly remembered why the room was so familiar.  It was my childhood bedroom from when I must have been around 2 or 3.  I've never really thought of that place before.  But what I was looking at was so realistic.  The lighting from the lamp (it was nighttime) on the wall and the casting shadows.  I couldn't calm down.  Then something even stranger happened.  I heard my dad's voice.  It was soft and behind the door.  He said, ""I'm going to check on Vinzent.""  He was talking to my mom.  I was sitting up in bed just staring at the room and the door.  The handle turned and he walked in.  And he looked a lot younger (I guess like 20 years younger if I was 2 or 3 at the time).

He stopped right where he had poked his head through, hand still on the knob.  He was shocked.  ""Who are you!??"" He said with shock and alarm in his voice. That's when I noticed there was a baby crib right next to my bed and a 2 year old was inside.  I can't describe the tone of confusion I felt.  It was the most unique feeling I've ever had.

Then as if I blinked, I was just looking at my own room where I had just woken up.  But I was sitting up and it didn't feel like I had just woken up.

**Now my question is:** Was that just a very vivid lucid dream or did something else just happen?  This didn't feel like a dream though, it felt as if I was literally put into somebody else's body during waking life within the snap second I opened my eyes during SP.

* Ability to journal each dream according to type (normal dream, lucid dream by MILD, WILD, etc)
* Post dreams as private to avoid public view
* Comment on dreams to provide interpretations or general commentary
* Discover and contribute fun lucid dreaming task ideas with the community
* Compete with other users for high dream-related ranks (such as most entries, most comments, most lucids)
* Assign dreamsigns to each dream in the form of tags, to help others discover your dream journal and to help gather statistics on your dreamsigns (see below)
* View analytics for your dream journal, including a simple bar graph illustrating percentages of each dream type, the longest you've spent without missing a journal entry, your community rank per achievement, and your five most frequently occurring dreamsigns.
* A library of lucid dream-related instructional content for beginners
* Collaborate with other users via a private messaging system

The following is planned:

* Android app that will allow you to publish to the site
* Achievements for each rank type
* Community bulletin board

With this app, you can command your dream world to let you fly, stabilize the dream, spawn items, summon people, teleport and even undo your last action.

I hope this will help those who can become lucid, but have trouble with dream control. I am open to critique and discussion regarding the use of the placebo effect to play on the expectation principle in the dream world. I wanted to make this much more complex, but it turns out that Android programming is not so easy.

It is a remote control to let you control the dream. The idea is to play with the app during the day, then when you are lucid, pull it out of your pocket and go to town! I feel it offers a better system than simply willing something to happen, or having your dream make the app for you. This provides something concrete you can use to offload the effort needed to accomplish dream control.

Also, it costs money to register on the android market, so I just have the APK hosted on my dev server

It definitely felt like this was the inner sanctum of my mind, and I could not enter. The door knob spoke to me, sorta like in Alice in Wonderland or something. 

I asked the door how I could enter. It said ""it all has to do with the manner in which you knock""

I take this to mean, the reason why you seek knowledge, or a particular experience determines your inner self's willingness to permit you into it's deeper levels. So if your quest is selfish, or you just wanna have a wild sex experience, there are areas of your mind that don't want you there. I think there's a loving, ego-less, ""higher"" state of being if you will deep inside us all, nirvana or something. 

I think this idea translates into life as well. Knocking on your friends door is different than knocking on a strangers door to sell them something. I took the experience to mean, it's more about the questions than the answers sometimes, and your goals affect the outcome of your pursuits. 

Not sure if I opened the door or not, I think I knocked. If anything it was some sort of blinding light or something, and I have no recollection of anything after, like going to another dimension where your normal senses don't work, so your brain has no means of encoding memory.

1) I've experienced a few dreams where I am aware that I am dreaming and have partial control. One of my dreams seemed much more lucid than the others, not because I had slightly more control, but because my senses were completely intact. In a moment, everything became clear, and I could actually feel and appreciate my surroundings. Not only this, but everything was beautiful and my feelings were of euphoria. Is this common of LDs?

2) Can you ever really attain full control? For example: can I say that I want to go to Disney World and ride the roller-coasters and hope for this to really happen in my dream?

3) Have you ever been able to communicate in an interesting and educational way with your subconscious?

Did maybe 4-5 before I started getting distracted by my thoughts.
I did more slow cycles whenever I remembered it.
Had a slight trouble falling asleep again.

Had some non-LD until at one point I was walking down the street and realized that the next thing I was supposed to do was to go to school and I instantly knew that I was asleep.

I hope to get some feedback and maybe some similar experiences!  


I know there are ""techniques"" to lucid dreaming that have already been explained and talked about to death.


This is a bit different.


It doesn't require practice or anything of that nature, only a wild idea that most of us are not used to dealing with.


Courage.


The story of the dream:  I was at a gas station filling up my car at the pump.  I accidentally dropped the gas cap and it rolled under the car.  I got down on my stomach and managed to fit my entire body underneath the car to try to get this gas cap.  Now here is the terrifying part...  I went to slide OUT from underneath the car, but I was stuck.  I realized I could barely move anything for that matter.  So what does ANYONE naturally do in this situation??  Panic.  I could feel my heart rate spike, my pupils get large, body trembling, everything was going all ""fight or flight"" on me.  This was truly a nightmare for me because the last thing I would ever want is a slow death by being stuck or by asphyxiation.  


Here's one of the two places where I could have woken up:


If I continued to panic I would eventually get worked up to the point where I would wake up.  I would have that sense of relief, but probably not remember why. 


Here's what happened instead:


I begin to calm down and accept the fact that this is the worst thing that has ever happened... easier said than done.  I slowed my breathing, tried to focus, pretty much anything that kept my mind off of being stuck.  Soon enough I was free.  


Just like that... completely stuck, to freely moving and walking around.  Since I was calm I started to question how it happened.  There is only one explanation... I was in a dream.  


This is the second time I could have woken up:


This is where people usually wake up as well.  Some wake up because they are excited, others because they are terrified of being ""awake"" in a different consciousness level.  I was worried because this was the first time I have ever realized I was in a dream.  Fear of the unknown began to cloud my thoughts.  


Here is where courage comes into play:


I thought back to when I was stuck under the car.  How trapped and scared I felt.  I tried replicate that state of mind where being calm solved my problems.  It did.  I began to accept the lucid dream and tell myself it's okay that I'm actually laying in bed asleep.  From there on I had a great time... yada yada yada everyone has heard those stories before.  


The secret for me was courage.  I did something that went against my instincts and it caught my subconscious off-guard.  It is not something that can be practiced, but in the moment it will be that wild thought that nobody wants to face and accept.  At first it was death for me.  I accepted death.  Then it was fear of the unknown, ""what would happen to me if stayed lucid?"".  Courage helped me in both dilemmas.


I hope this helps!  Stay courageous fellow oneironauts!





**TL;DR**: The secret to having a lucid dream is having the courage to stand up to your fears.  By doing this it disrupts the normal timeline of dreams and sparks a realization that you are in a dream.  From there you must remain calm and not try to wake up out of being excited/fearful.

I started lucid dreaming when I was a teenager. I guess I would be considered a natural, I don't use any methods or RC's. I went from a few a year, to a couple a month, then by the time I was in collage I was lucid dreaming every day. I attributed it to my unusual sleep patterns. 

Then suddenly when I was about 25, they stopped. Suddenly I would panic during SP,  and feel like I was smothering. SP was something that never bothered me before. Then, after a while my dream recall became very poor, and it felt like my dreams were very few and far between. 

Suddenly about a month ago, I star dreaming more vividly, and more often. A almost became lucid about a week and a half ago, but it was during a nightmare and I just aborted the dream and woke up. Then last night it finally happened. I was dreaming I was at a party and borrowed someone's phone. As soon as I was finished with the phone and was about to return it, I had the realization that I was dreaming. So what did I do? After a 5 year dry spell I felt like fuckin flying.

[This is a good read for anyone and everyone!](http://www.dreamviews.com/f12/naiyas-dild-wild-secrets-61802/)

Want better recall? More vivid dreams? Want to get lucid more often? [Then THIS is for you... ](http://www.dreamviews.com/f49/all-day-awareness-dild-tutorial-kingyoshi-113253/)Awareness is the key to Lucid Dreaming... Like, I'm not even kidding... Look, I'll explain. The term 'Lucid' means aware... So 'Lucid Dreaming' is 'Aware Dreaming'... And how can you be 'Aware Dreaming' without being 'AWARE'?!?! So, yes. Literally... If Lucid Dreaming was a lock, then Awareness is be the key to open it.

Take the time to read through both of those... I guarantee you that you will notice results...


Also, here are some more things that you pretty much have to do if you want to start getting regular Lucid Dreams:

Keeping a Dream Journal is a complete MUST. No 'buts'. Seriously. What's the point of getting Lucid if you can't even remember you did? If you think that's impossible, it's happened to me... (Managed to somehow remember a lucid dream at the end of the day when something triggered my memory)

Get lots of sleep! Over 8 hours is pretty much the minimum, 10 hours is preferred. The more REM you have, the higher chance you have of getting lucid... I think about 80% of my Lucids have been in the morning, when my REM was at it's peak. 

(Optional) If you really want to remember your dreams.. Before you go to bed, get a pad and paper, and write down EVERYTHING you did that day... From the moment you woke up, to this... Write down absolutely everything you can remember... Your thoughts, your feelings, anything and everything! This will most likely drastically boost your dream recall that night. If it doesn't, try doing it for 2 nights more, and its nearly a 100% guarantee it will work!

[Make sure you do Reality Checks right.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/ru8iu/reality_check_misconception/) I'm linking to one of my other posts because I just want to stress how important this is!!! So pretty much, make sure you do ADA (All Day Awareness) when you RC.

PERSEVERE!!! Keep at it! So important! Honestly! It took me about a month to get my first Lucid, so I was like ""yay! I'm a pro!"" But then I didn't get Lucid again for another 3 months, which really sucked.. But I kept at it, and then got about 2-4 Lucids, and then had another gap of about 3-4 months... But I persevered, and now my Lucid frequency is getting up to about 1 per week... 


That's pretty much all that I can think of right now... I really hope you guys take the time to read through the links.. At least read through the reality check one! I NEVER do this, but I'm going to ask if you guys could PLEASE up-vote this so that more people can see it, and more people can broaden their knowledge on Lucid Dreaming, and so that they can start getting more Lucid Dreams!!! :D

This is pretty much an outpouring of a lot of the stuff that I know... Use it wisely... 

Happy Dreaming!

The sun was shining through my window, and nothing looked out of place.

I did a quick RC upon awakening, and went to check my hands and realised I couldn't move my head! I thought maybe my body was still sleeping, but I was awake, so I lay there for a moment, waiting for my body to move. When I went to check my hands again, I could feel my arms moving, but nothing was appearing in front of my face, so at that point I had a feeling I might have still been dreaming. I managed to pull my body to the side of the bed and look in the mirror - no reflection! 
I realised if I closed my eyes, I could go into a different type of dream, but instead observed the room for any other hints to whether I was dreaming - the only thing that stood out was that there was an extra mirror in the room. 

Basically, no matter how real things might appear, I found out how important it is to do a quick RC to make sure.

I realised I was dreaming and *instantly* woke up. I woke up in my usual sleeping position, barely conscious and hallucinating the remnants of my lucid dream. I may have been in SP, but I can't be sure because I didn't try to move. I decided to try a WILD. I fell back asleep in 3 or 4 seconds, and went directly into another lucid dream, which turned into one of the most terrifying dreams I have ever had. 

My journal entry for the second LD I had this morning;

I notice everything around me is in perfect detail and consistency. There are dozens of people around me, all crowded around a burning store. I tell them to get away, and they seem to listen. As the crowds move away, a volcano erupts, which makes the crowds of people gathering around the intersection panic. Ice and rock boulders rain down out of the sky, I yell at people to take shelter. I decide I don't like where this dream is heading, so I try to change the scene, but nothing works. A [pyroclastic flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow) barrels through the streets, destroying everything in it's path. I rescue a baby that was in a pram on the side walk, and take shelter inside a metal bus stop. I crouch there for ages, protecting the baby from the torrent of ash and debris. The light dims as the ash completely blocks out almost all light, and I am left to sit in the dark. The ash continues, and I remain crouched. I try to change the dream, force it to end, but nothing works and this frightens me. *I attempted to exit the dream by forcing my eyes shut, which, up until now, has been 100% effective.* My fear causes the dream to take a turn for the worse. Tall figures appear in the distance, silhouetted in the thick blizzard of ash. I know they are coming for me, and I also notice the baby I had in my arms is gone. I turn to my left to look for a way to escape, and one of the dark figures is staring at me, about 3 inches away, on the other side of the glass window of the bus stop. I start to run, which unsurprisingly, gets me nowhere. I feel a hand on my shoulder, turn around, and nothing is there. I struggle to breathe, mostly out of fear and exhaustion (*still lucid at this point)*. Again, my usual means of dream ejection fail, and I still have no control over anything. I shut my eyes permanently, hoping it will all go away. I feel something, which I think may have been a spear, go through my upper chest. It's a tingly sensation. Sounds of thunder and rocks falling disappear, my sense of touch as well. I drift for a while and lose lucidity. Something screams very loud. It echoes, as if I am in a room. I am. I notice a gap in a door where light is shining through and proceed to open it. One of the tall dark figures bursts through the door and thrusts a spear through my face, resulting in me waking up.

my problem is, that I find it hard to fall asleep without getting into a lucid dream.

Most of the times when I try to sleep, I close my eyes and I'm gone in a few minutes (I'm a super fast sleeper). Sometimes it happens that I'm in a dream immediately and I know it. So I hang around there and try to kill the time but eventually I get in uncomfortable situations and decide to wake up. That's easy as I know I'm sleeping and I just open my eyes.

I relaxed my body and repeated the mantra, “I am dreaming” over and over. I slipped from waking directly into a lucid dream. I knew i was dreaming as i hadn’t lost consciousness and I was no longer in my bedroom. I performed reality check for the hell of it and pushed my fingers into the palm of my hand. It felt normal, but when i looked at my hand, my fingers were sticking out the other side. 

That's when I started to lose the dream, so I focused on the floor and its details, took in the texture of the concrete, the cracks in it and its roughness which managed to stabilize the dream. I walked out of the room and I was at the side of a lake. 

There were picnic tables and people hanging out, talking to each other, i couldn’t hear them though, there was no audio at all in the dream that i recall. 

I decided to see if i could do anything cool, so I tried to fly, i managed to jump up onto the roof, then I jumped way off the roof out into the sky over the lake. Thats all i remember, i lost lucidity and recollection after that. Not sure if i was truly flying or doing a really big jump. I was moving in a straight line, not turning in the air, so may not have been proper flying.

I'm a big dragon ball z fan (username relevent lol) so when I become lucid I either want to have sex (let's be honest, most of us do it) or I fly around and fight monsters. Last night I chose the latter. 


I was flying around, having a good time, when I was suddenly attacked by this giant satan-looking demon. Big red muscular thing, black horns, goat-like legs. Well I fought him but wasn't able to win at first. I was chained and taken to this dungeon/cave looking place. It was dark blue and we were descending. when we reached the bottom my friends and family were there. Because I lost to the monster, everyone was enslaved and the monster was going to eat them.


Suddenly, this thing rises from the ground. It was this strange L shaped block (Kind of the shame shape as the pokemon Missingno) it had eyes all over it. My dream self ""knew"" that this was god, and by touching it I could harness its powers and become a god myself. So I touched it, and all the sudden I was glowing with a red aura. 


I walked towards the monster and challenged him again. We were flying at each other, fighting in mid air. I could ""feel"" the pain of being hit, and kept fighting. I start creating balls of energy in my hands and firing them at the demon. Shortly into the fight it was apparent I had the upper hand. I was now a god and far too powerful for this demon. We land on the ground and stare at each other. I lean to the side, cup my hands and live out my childhood fantasy, ""ka-me"" a bright blue ball of energy appears in my hands, I can literally ""feel"" it's over whelming power surge through me, ""ha-me"". It's almost ready, I see the demon preparing a blast of his own, I have to act quickly, ""ha!!!"". I fire the blast at the demon and destroy him. Everyone is free, the world is saved. Then I wake up because my kids are crying, back to reality :/

How can I take myself from knowing that something isn't right into confirming that I am dreaming?

Basically, for my entire life, as far back as I can remember, I have always known I am dreaming when I am asleep. Be it a long night's sleep or the short day dream of a catnap, I am always conscious of the fact that I am in the dream world. I almost always remember my dreams. I always have limited control of the dreams, but I can affect what's happening in the dream on some nights more than others. I don't usually have the ability to pick the topic of my dream right off the bat though. The best way I can describe it is like playing a really interactive video game, or watching a movie that I am able to make directorial changes to in the middle of the story. Here's a list of things I can always do in any dream:

* Wake myself up

* Have all the same senses I do IRL

* I don't fly very often, but my general form of getting myself around is doing these high, long jumps with lots of hang time

* Rewind and watch a ""scene"" over again, usually with the rewrites that I think will make the situation more interesting

* Cut characters I don't like and bring new ones in

* I can either watch the dream in third person or experience from the eyes of myself as a character in the dream. I can switch from one character to another so I can watch the dream from the eyes of others. 

* There are ""sets"" or certain places that I revisits often

I also talk, sing, yell, cry, etc in my sleep and I move a lot as well, mimicking walking, fighting, dancing, or sometimes my body just shakes a lot. So I am wondering if anyone can tell me what level of progress I am at in the lucid dreaming world. 


I would like to learn how to have more control. I don't feel like I can always access my full catalog of choices of what I want to do in a dream or where I want to go. For instance, I would like to be able to start dreaming and immediately tell my brain, ""Alright, tonight we're going to ancient Egypt and we will be having dinner with Oscar Wilde."" I would also like to be able to be more aware of experiencing my subconcious. If you have any clarifying questions, feel free to ask. Thanks!

With all the hype and amazing success that's currently surrounding Remee, I think it's important that we calm ourselves down just a little bit. Like many of you, I'm *super* pumped about it, and I'm certainly looking forward to when it arrives on my doorstep. I just think we need to all collectively lower our expectations. If we don't, I think some people will be sorely disappointed when this product finally ships.

Here's the thing: It's **not** going to succeed 100% of the time. In fact, we might be looking at something like a 10-30% success rate if you're lucky and skilled at using it (*especially* in the weeks starting out). **I'm just pulling that number out of thin air**, but it's important to emphasize that we need to be prepared for a lower success rate. We won't really know how effective it is on the general population until it ships. Lucid dreams have always been, and will likely always be, a somewhat difficult thing to achieve for many people. It's unfair to the creators of this project to start off with such high expectations. It's unfair to think of this as a guaranteed thing, that everyone can strap on day one and achieve a lucid dream. It may very well be a fantastic tool, but it still needs to be in the right hands (or head really) to be successful.

From now until the product ships, if people want to be successful, they should begin practicing the following techniques especially (all of which can be found in guides on this subreddit):

* Dream recall (keep a dream journal)
* Reality checks (from now on, check every single time you see a red light)
* Dream control (keeping calm, prolonging dreams)

Everyone's been really happy and excited, but I'm sure a lot of you do realize this. I also know that there are people out there who have heard nothing or very little about lucid dreaming before this, and may find this message useful. In no way am I trying to discourage people from the product, I just want people to be informed.

That about sums it up. Thanks guys!",,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,t3_ru139,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/ru139/a_precaution_about_remee/,

So, I woke up at ~7:30 this morning and figured I'd give it a shot. I relaxed my body and kept my mind focused (randomly decided to spell out words in cursive; it seemed to do the trick) but every time i started to feel sleep paralysis kicking in, I would start thinking too much about my breathing, my heart rate would go up, and I would tense up and lose it.  I went through that cycle 3 or 4 times in different sleeping positions, then eventually I found myself going into sleep paralysis, with the crazy buzzing sensation and auditory hallucinations. Those turned into a white ghost-like head that was mouthing words I couldn't hear. That faded away and turned into a heard of elephants circling around my head. 

Then for some reason I got a really strong feeling that there was a giant spider in my bed. I ""woke up"", jumped out of my bed, and screamed as I saw this giant ant-like creature scurrying across my bed. I looked away, and when I looked back there was a brown lizard on my bed with the ant in its mouth.... at this point I started getting a little suspicious.  I went to my window and noticed a picnic table in my back yard with all of the things in my room on it. At that point I was lucid! I went downstairs into my living room where my mom and dad were and immediately started spinning to get better stability.  It wasn't that long or eventful, but I did go outside and fly around a bit (that always seems to be the first thing i do after becoming lucid), and noticed that there were an insane amount of stars in the sky, before I found myself lying in my spider/ant/lizard free bedroom :)

1333042552.0,55,self.LucidDreaming,rjise,Sleep Paralysis Identification/Walk-through,Th3angryman,56,1,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/rjise/sleep_paralysis_identificationwalkthrough/,"Now, I've seen a lot of posts on this subreddit about using the WILD (Wake Induced Lucid Dream) technique and attempting to recognise sleep paralysis. The large majority of them are usually something about 'what is SP?' or 'How do I know when it's set in?' I hope to answer some or most of the questions regarding SP in this post.

***What is Sleep Paralysis(SP)?***

Sleep paralysis is the physical state of the human body when it falls asleep. There's nothing too magical about this other than the fact that it stops you walking around when you have dreams, lucid or otherwise. You experience it every time when you fall asleep, but you only notice it while you attempt to WILD as a result of staying conscious.

***How can I induce it?***

Inducing sleep paralysis sounds like a very hard thing to do, when really all it involves is the ability to ignore messages sent from your brain to check if you're sleeping yet. You induce SP by lying still in a position you are comfortable in and doing this with your eyes closed. This tricks your body into thinking that it should be sleeping, when *you* want to stay awake.

There are a few signs to look out for/ignore when inducing SP, which I shall list off here:

* Itching - This can be a bitch to overcome. On some nights I personally fell like I have a rash that's spread all over my body just begging me to itch it. Sorry for the details, but it's the best example I can think of. Sometimes it's only a small itch somewhere on your body that fades after a minute or two.

* Swallowing - This impulse isn't that hard to overcome. Sleeping people can swallow reflexively without thinking, so doing it as an impulse wouldn't hurt. Actually thinking 'I need to swallow' is where most people tend to trip up.

*  (Reverse) Blinking - Now, most of you are thinking 'Blinking? But my eyes are already closed!' Yes, you are right about that, but when awake some people get the urge to open their eyes for a brief second and close them again. This one isn't too hard to overcome as all it takes is the ability of closing your eyes harder then usual, but not hard enough for it to keep you awake.

I would list off more, but these seem to be the most common ones I could find, along with the fact that there are so many ways in which your brain can check to see if you're sleeping.

***Ignoring the signs***

This step involves willpower, and a lot of it. On most nights it's tempting to just give up after your first try, but don't! Perseverance makes perfect! I would only recommend giving up if you think that you're not going to get enough sleep for the night after trying for too long.

***Recognising SP***

SP can be different for everyone, but the large majority of the time it isn't. This part will be on recognising the generalized signs that most people would feel.

You ever had the feeling that you were on a fair-ground ride while you were lying in your bed? That's one of the early stages of sleep paralysis. This is your body adjusting to sleeping and can send false messages back to your brain. It's pretty weird at first, but you'll get used to it.

It's around this point you should start to see some hypnagogic images, only if you keep your eyes closed and carry on staying still. It's at this point you want to start picturing where you want your dream to take place. Only picture the location though, and go into as much detail as you can. You've effectively taken over your subconsciousness' part in creating the landscape here, so do a good job of it.

After the initial 'fairground-effect', you should start to feel a slight juttering or twitching motion within your body. Again, this is normal. It's at this point your body starts to feel heavy and breathing may become strained. Keep going as you normally would and whatever you do, DON'T THINK OF SCARY DEMONS - THEY DO NOT EXIST. They only appear if you expect them to. Remember, you are the one in control while you WILD, not the other way around!

It's around here that most people eventually start to lucid dream after a few minutes of visualising, but it can vary from person to person. There's a great post below on going through what you might see, but [SpecialGuestSME](http://www.reddit.com/user/SpecialGuestSME) has allowed me to stick it up here:

'Ever since I could remember I used to get completely disoriented (I felt like I was spinning and floating in space, not lying in a bed) when I was trying to go to sleep. Another thing is closed-eye visuals- I used to see very detailed geometric patterns in my mind's eye- though not very colorful (mostly a mix of a muddy brown/green and black) they were always very fast-moving and intricate. I used to feel the proportions of my body change - arms getting longer, legs getting shorter. Even if my head was facing forward I'd feel my chin on my shoulder. 

I used to wake up/move around to re-orient myself. But last night, after what felt like a very brief period of laying still, I was spinning. Then I felt my body moving, like it was rearranging itself. Then the visuals came. I let them play and tried following different 'pixels' with my minds eye, when suddenly it all unified and started rotating. Then sound kicked in - a chopper passes overhead. I was looking up at it as it flew over me. I look forward, I'm standing in a jungle. My heart jumped and I'm back in my bed. A few more minutes of trying to SP and this time the pixels swept away as I felt a wind on the side of my face, I'm standing in a desert at dawn. My heart jumps again, and I'm awake.'

***Tools to use***

There are a few different tools and sounds that you can use to help induce an LD, such as binaural beats and a few apps for i-phones/android devices. I personally find that they can greatly help you when attempting to WILD, or any other form of LD techniques for that matter. Here's my two favourites.

[Gamma Binaural Sound](http://jetcityorange.com/binaural-beats/gamma-10min.mp3) - This is my personal favourite out of pretty much all the LD aids and tools I could find. Right click on the player and then click 'save video as', it should save it as an MP3. For what a binaural beat is, we experience binaural beats when we hear two different frequencies, one in each ear. The binaural beat is defined as the difference between the two pitches. For example, if you hear a 200Hz sound in one ear and a 190Hz sound in the other you’ll hear a 10Hz binaural beat because 200 - 190 = 10. You require stereo sound ear-buds/headphones in order for it to work though, and a pair that you wouldn't mind sleeping in as well. Setting this to loop while falling asleep is the best way to go for it.

[Sleep as Android](https://sites.google.com/site/sleepasandroid/) - This was actually already posted on [/r/LucidDreaming](/r/LucidDreaming), but I've been using the app for a while now. It's one of the best apps for android that I could find when it came to tracking my sleeping pattern. It's filled with far too many uses for me to list here, so go check it out!

In my dream I woke up and started about my day as usual, my house seemed prefectly normal and I went downstairs to have breakfast. I turned the kitchen light on and nothing happened, and that's when I became aware that I was dreaming, after which I began to notice odd details about the house that just seemed ""off"", like the street outside wasn't my street, and the house was oddly spacious and things were just generally weird. I panicked a little but then decided to think of all the things that I would love to be able to experience. I went and sat on the floor where my dog's bed used to be and called him, not expecting anything to happen really, but he came padding out of the living room like he'd been there all this time, like he never left. I bawled my eyes out in the dream as he came and sat by me, licking my face, I hugged him and ruffled his fur and even though I knew I was dreaming, I forgot that he had ever died, I even called my mum in the dream and told her that Ben's legs were fine now and we could take him for walks again and there was no need to put him to sleep now. I remember thinking that I didn't want to wake up, but at the same time I was excited to wake up because I thought Ben would be there. It's really weird how your mind works in dreams. I took Ben upstairs and let him jump on my bed, he layed down next to me and I stroked his fur as I ""fell asleep"" in the dream, as I began to sleep in the dream I began to wake in real life, with tears streaming down my face with my arm stretched out over an empty space in my bed. I'm tearing up even as I write this. Sometimes lucid dreams can be very cruel.

One of my friends had family ties to the mexican mafia in my dream. He was being a real jerk, demanding to fetch him food and saying things at a personal level. 

He was sitting down and I was passing by. He told me to fetch him a drink. I was fed up with his unusual behavior. So, I told him, ""If you want a drink you can get it yourself. Your only acting this way because of your family and their goons."" 

His family heard everything and they didn't take it to kindly. Two of the younger members went up to fight me. The first one to approach me had his head too low so I gave him a good uppercut, which knocked him to his knees. A brutal knee to the temple followed knocking him out. I lunged towards the second guy and he backed off after seeing what I was capable of. 

In the backround I can see a few of the older heads cocking back their weapons and getting ready to murder me. My friend got up and stood between me and the gunmen. He was assuring me that nothing was going to happen and asked for them to put away their weapons. He said, ""If you want to walk away from all this, all you got to do is apologize to me."" 

It was cold of him to put me on the spot, but since my life was on the line I told him sorry. He acted like he didn't hear and told me to say it again. Now he was just toying with me. I said sorry once more, but again he pretended as if he didn't hear me. The gunmen in crowd tried egging me on so I would fight him and give them reason to shoot me. This time I responded by speaking from the heart. I told him, ""It doesn't matter what you say or what they expect me to do. I'm truly sorry and if you don't want accept my apology, so be it."" 

He put his head down. I guess he was processing what I just said. He finally came to his senses and gave me a hand shake followed by a hug. He apologized to me for acting a fool. One of gangters came up to me and said, ""Congratulations. You passed the test."" 

He reached out to give me a hand shake, but it was no ordinary hand shake. He was giving me something. I looked down at my hand and saw that he had handed me a small shiv. I looked back up at him and he told me, ""You kill him or we kill you!"" 

He casually walked away and stood in the shadows watching as I made my decision. Given this ultimatum, I was stressing out. I didn't want to kill my friend and I certainly didn't want to be killed. This made me question reality which miraculously lead to lucidity. 

I walked outside where a few of them were waiting. They gave me this sinister smile and took out there weapons and started firing. People from the party started running and screaming. They unloaded their whole clip on me, but when the smoke settled I was untouched. They were confused, but they all started reloading their weapons. As they were reloading I said some cold blooded shit. I said, ""I am not god. I am the devil and you passed my test. Welcome to my kingdom."" 

As one of the guys was finished reloading I walked up to him and snapped his neck. The others said ""fuck this"" and took off running. I ran after one of them and folded him like bread, snapping his spine. I threw an invisible lasso on one of the other guys running away. I pulled him back and he flew right below my feet. I saw the terror in his eyes before I stomped his brains out. 

I woke up soon after a bit puzzled by my dream. I wish I didn't become lucid because now I'm unsure what I would of chose when came down to me or my friend. It seemed that my mind was testing my morals, but lucidity got in the way of things. I just wanted to share this so I can look back on this since I don't have a dream journal

**TL;DR:** I was in a dream where my friend, who was related to the mexican mafia for some reason, demanded me to get him a drink. I denied him and he told me to apologize or I was going to get killed. I apologized, but was given an ultimatum to either kill my friend or get killed. I became lucid and tore some shit up. I woke up and realized that my mind was testing my morals, but lucidity ruined it.

I didn't find out, but my train of thoughts led me to find this funny task. 

.

Imagine you have three wooden poles, each of them sharp at the end.

You take the first pole and stick it into the ground.

You tie the first pole to your second pole with an elastic that is 3 meters long.

From your second pole to your third pole you have a rope that is 1 meter long.

Now, you are free to levitate the poles around in your mind. However, the first pole stays in the ground, and you have to keep the location of this pole in mind the whole time.

You stick the second pole into the ground 3 meters from the first pole, then move the third pole one meter ahead of the second pole, then move the second pole one meter ahead of the third pole again. You can use the third pole to measure meters

How far can you move the second pole away from the first pole before the tension in the elastic gets too strong? Try it. The more vivid an image you can imagine, the better.

.

I personally made it to 8 meters before my imaginary string became too much of a task for my own imagination to pull. I find this seemingly easy task pretty interesting since I previously assumed I had full control of my own thoughts, at least while awake, and I think this is relatable to the same control you strive to achieve in your dreams.

I'm not sure if I explained this in the best way possible. If someone out there gets the idea and can explain it better than me, that would be appreciated.

Honestly, if you start sleeping naked you'll notice clothing a LOT more.  And because my mom was using these two books to teach me the secrets of flying, and the pages kept changing.

But now that I've LD'd I've got a few questions about it: 

Why couldn't I feel stimulation while having sex?  (Yes, I know.  First thing I do while dreaming is try and bang a chick.) 

I kept trying to fly, but couldn't do more than jump, why?

I was able to control my own actions but that was about it.  I couldn't control my environment, my abilities, the people around, or really anything else for that matter.  Are there any tips you can give me for next time?

Any other good information that you guys would like to share would be appreciated!  I feel like a whole new world has opened before me, and I'm one of the chosen few who can see it.  Especially because I haven't been keeping a dream journal I think it's amazing I was able to LD at all.

Scattered throughout the game are effect items that let Madotsuki move faster, kill the often grotesque DC's (they come back, don't worry) or just wear things on her head. There is no explicit story behind the game, but finding every single effect will open up an ending cutscene.

Apart from its brilliance in its own right, Yume Nikki (Dream Diary) can be a useful tool for dreamers. Run through a few worlds before going to bed to help seed your own dreams (nighttime sessions are always the best). Practice your world-building ability by recreating one of Madotsuki's worlds. And if the game itself interests you, see if you can ~~read the entire wiki~~ find every world, character, and effect on your own!

Yume Nikki comes pre-packaged and pre-English-translated. However, its dozens of fangames and imitators do not. Here are some of the most popular fangames, each starring a different girl and a different dream world:

* [**LcdDem**](http://lcddem.wikia.com/wiki/LCDDEM_Wiki) does without most of the disturbing imagery Yume Nikki loves, and features more realistic and more calm locations like flower fields and the ocean floor. Probably better for actual lucid dreaming utility than YN once you've played both.
* [Yume 2kki](http://yume2kki.wikia.com/wiki/Yume_2kki_Wiki) is considered the unofficial sequel to YN. It's *huge* in comparison, and still unfinished, which justifies the lack of an English version.
* [.flow](http://dotflow.wikidot.com/) isn't the best tool for dreaming on account of it beng creepy as all fuck.

I went to bed at about 11pm and stayed on my phone for a few hours, at around 3am I was feeling extremely tired and decided to put my phone away and go to sleep, remembering to start moving the fingers on my hand. I can't really say how long it took, but it felt like an extremely long time, I thought ""Well this was a waste of time"" and went to move my arms into a more relaxing position when they literally went straight through the covers on my bed. After a moment of confusion I RC'd by poking a finger through my hand and realized that I was dreaming. I immediately got out of bed and started rubbing my hands together to stabilize the dream, then I hopped up to begin testing things out. I floated up for a moment or two then landed back on the floor and it all felt so real that I tried another RC, also successful.

Now that I had properly established I was in a dream, I did the first thing that came to mind. I ran and jumped out of my second story window and flew up into the sky, a euphoric feeling was present as I embraced the moment and flew around for a while, eventually hovering over what seemed to be a lake a couple hundred meters away from my home that does not exist in reality. I flew around for another few minutes then slowly dipped into the lake by accident which dragged me out of lucidity and put me into a deep sleep, I then woke up in the morning feeling refreshed and with a vivid memory of what I had done.

I pretty much wanted to write this to say that it is possible to LD without trying hard with dream recall journals and other things although it will probably help a great deal, I also want to recommend FILD for those of you having trouble with LD'ing for the first time.

Background: I've heard of lucid dreaming before, but never before exposed myself to any of the methods to do so or tried before.
~10 minute ago I woke up from my first lucid dream, which I wrote down in my dream journal and would like to share (don't know if this is allowed but whatever).

So, I couldn't remember the trigger but after I realized I was in a dream It was night in my house (12, I'm 18) and me and my sister were wandered around the inside of my house. For some reason because I was conciouse it was a dream my mind decided that I didn't get to have sight. We went outside and I made it rain (due perhaps to a post on r/lucidreaming ~5 hours ago about making it rain to prolong dreams). I felt the rain on my face for a while. Then I started walking towards the street, withmy eyes closed (for some reason, even though I knew I was dreaming, I thought I was ACTUALLY about to walk into the street) and I could hear cars. It was then when my sister stopped me and led me back inside. After this, I lost my lucidity, as I woke up, thinking that in my lucid dream I had sleep walked, explained the concept to my little sister, then later again to my mother, talking about how unsafe it was. I remember feeling my hair and knowing it was wet. Anyway, after this there was some more events that I remembered, but I was no longer consious I was in a dream, it was a false awakening. Then I woke up!

Happened after waking up and going back to sleep twice.
Not induced by WILD or MILD but I was thinking about RCs alot. (5 fingers, looking at text twice, and breathing out of the mouth).

Anyway, I don't know if yall find these things interesting, but I figured I'd share. 
If anything it's cool I got off to such a great start after just reading this subreddit for a short time!

Edit: Going back to sleep

As a student and full-time worker, I have trouble getting enough quality sleep. To help with that, I've purchased these four supplements and have taken them for the first time last night:

* [Melatonin](http://www.amazon.com/Foods-Melatonin-High-Grade-Capsules/dp/B0019LTGC2/)
* [GABA](http://www.amazon.com/NOW-Foods-Gaba-750mg-Vcaps/dp/B0013OVZAG/)

* [Relora](http://www.amazon.com/Now-Foods-Relora-Veg-capsules-120-Count/dp/B0019LTGRW/)

I've taken all 4 together on an empty stomach an hour before bedtime. I was not very sleepy when I've gone to bed, but I remember falling asleep pretty quickly.

The night brought me the MOST intense and realistic lucid dreams I've ever experienced. I have experienced lucid dreams before, but like most people, as soon as I realize that I'm dreaming, I'd usually wake up, or soon ""forget"" that I'm dreaming. The dream from last night was nothing like that. I was aware that I'm dreaming for what seemed like hours, I was traveling (usually flying) everywhere feeling surprised just how real everything felt, the landscape could be changed based on my mood. I woke up very refreshed and full of energy at 6:30am, when I usually have trouble waking up by 8am.

I've never believed that I'd have the patience and persistence to achieve lucid dreaming on my own, but with these supplements, it seems that I don't even have to try.

I hope someone will find this helpful and also achieve their lucid goals!

P.S.

I also take the following supplements regularly (for a few months), and while I didn't experience lucid dreaming with them, they might've helped potentiate the effects.

* Multivitamin (A,B,C,D,E,MK-7)
* Noopept
* Choline CDP
* CoQ10
* Calcium-Magnesium-Zinc

I realized in the middle that this was because my body didn't want to do anything extreme in real life. 

But-- here's what I also discovered.  There was a way around it.  I convinced myself that because it was my dream, I was in complete control. I thought, if I just do a pretend whisper-scream, it'll be just as loud as a real scream.  And it worked!  Also, for throwing rocks and throwing punches, I just told myself that I didn't have to exert myself too much to throw ""as hard as I could"" or to throw an effective punch.

The first time I ever had a Lucid Dream was the day I found out that it existed. Not because I am a naturally gifted LDer (far from it) but rather because it was *very heavy on my mind that day*.

Like most of us, I was intrigued after first reading about it. All day I wondered what it would be like, and craved for one that night.

And so, without doing a RC or anything, it just occurred to me that I was dreaming that night.

I just wanted to highlight the importance of being actively conscious throughout the day about LD. This includes things like ADA, RCs and Dream Journals. I also wanted to inspire confidence in other beginner's like me, as a reminder of how simple LD can be.

My advice would just be to think of as many excuses as you can throughout the day to remind your sub-consciousness that it want's to LD tonight. (""*Hey, that's a cool tree. Maybe I'll see it in my dream tonight.*"") All of the DILD techniques help with this.

Computer games had a massive influence, and I believe they still weigh in quite heavily. 

I occasionally have lucid dreams. Usually, as i've seen is normal, they start as regular dreams, then I realise i'm dreaming (realise is too violent a term, it's closer to ""begin to notice""). After that, it's about balancing the dream state with some amount of control.

My cousin and I often speak of our dreams. We had a fairly similar gaming-orientated childhood, which we both believe had a real influence.

Whenever I speak with my girlfriend or family about it, they pass it off as if it's nothing. Some believe it's impossible, some just don't believe I can do it. The closest i've come to explaining it is 'meditation'.

I'll be lying in bed and I can't move at all. That sensation of numbness fills my entire body and somehow I know something awful is going to happen to me if I don't make myself wake up. I know I am dreaming and I am able to test this by trying to turn on my light (if I can ever get my arms to move). If I can't turn on the light I know I'm dreaming. I keep telling myself, ""WAKE UP!"", but nothing happens and I just lie there extremely distressed for what seems like 15 minutes. Finally, when I do wake up, I have to wake up twice because it is always a dream within a dream. 

I believe this all started after a terrible nightmare I had a couple years ago which involved the feeling of sleep paralysis. I kept waking up over and over again only to turn on my light and then have it immediately turn back off. When I finally managed to actually wake up, I was drenched in sweat and my heart was racing. It was the most terrifying dream I ever had, especially since I kept thinking I was awake over and over again. After this, I learned that if the lights don't work, I am most definitely dreaming. 

Anyways, my question is, am I close to being able to change this dream? If I know that I'm dreaming how hard will it be for me to begin to change what is happening and no longer be stuck lying in bed knowing something is coming to get me?

This subreddit helped inspire me to keep on, and I wanted to let y'all know what finally worked for me. 

Keeping a dream journal is great, but I had no consistency in ever recalling my dreams so it looked pretty sparse. Instead, I read a tip buried in the last comment of a forgotten post that advised just keeping a journal of everything you've done for the day instead. I mean, write down nearly every detail you can remember and try to be as accurate as possible.

No joke, just did this last night and had immediate results. Years of trying and had my first moment of lucidity and the most detailed dream I can ever remember in my life. I had zero control and immediately woke up, but it's a start. 

If you don't have amazing results on your first night, I would still advise that you keep it up for a few days. The main benefit for me is that during the day I try to accurately remember events for later so I don't have hour long gaps in my memory. I think this carries over to the dream because you've practiced remembering things all day. 

If that still doesn't work, then don't worry about keeping it up and just try a different technique. There's plenty of them on this subreddit so keep trying them all til you find one that works. 

TLDR: If you can't remember dreams at all, a dream journal probably isn't working so hot for you. Try keeping a journal of your regular day as if that were a dream to remember instead.

I had started to give up on the idea of ever LD'ing until 2 nights ago.

I had been camping for 2 nights before and LD'ing never even crossed my mind. I was just chilling away in my tent sleeping, when I woke up needing to pee. I got up, in the arctic temperature, and did my business, then went back to sleep. I then ""woke up"" in my tent but it felt a little off.

I looked next to me and my friend wasn't there (we were sharing a tent) and in his place was a fire! I didn't know what to do so I just stared at it really hard and put it out with my eyes :l

""I shouldn't be able to do that"" I thought to myself, and the idea I was dreaming popped in my head. So I tried to push my finger through my hand (my most common RC) and it went through! Weirdest feeling I have ever had; for some reason it just felt right. I didn't believe it so I tried counting my fingers, and I just couldn't. I could *see* 10 fingers but I kept counting to random numbers.

I had read that most new LD'ers get too excited, destabilize the dream and wake up, so I rubbed my hands while looking at them. It still felt a little fuzzy, so I spun on the spot. It **literally** felt like I was screwing myself into the world (no other way to explain it).

After that, everything became really clear. I was calm, collected, but no idea what I should do first. Still in my tent, I felt like it was too small so I started force pushing the tent bigger with my hands. It got bigger and bigger till it was as big as a house inside. Then I noticed a door on the wall and proceeded to walk through it.

On the other side, I found myself in my old street. Clear as day, I felt like I really was there. There was a friend of mine standing in the street and yelled to him but he was just standing looking up at the sky. I looked up where he was looking and seen a Skyrim dragon coming his way! I yelled at him to run but he just stood there.

I remembered I was dreaming and thought, ""I could take this thing down easy"". I thought in my head of it crashing, and just like in the game with the dragon rend shout, it fell to the street, missing my friend and crashing into a house.

I then woke up, RC'ed and was back to reality.

I've analyzed what I do in my lucid dreams, and thought I'd share it with you. I know some of you have troubles controlling your dreams, and I hope this can help you. If you can control your dreams already, then perhaps you can pick up a few new ideas.


**Belief**
The mind makes things real, beliefs included. If you believe you *can't* control your dreams, then you will be right. Same goes for the opposite. You need to believe that you can control the dream, and that the dream is not real. You need to fully believe that everything is possible within your lucid dream, and take it as a fact. Is the earth round? Yes. Will dreams follow your every command? Yes.

**Visualization**
One thing I found myself doing, without knowing it, is visualization. I *constantly* visualize what I want. I also pay attention to what I'm currently seeing (only what is in my field of view, that is). If you want something to be in the next room, try to visualize it and walk into there.
To accompany visualization, I think about what details are important to me. Recognizing what they are, and then visualizing them, will provide a powerful tool.

**Expectation**
This is similar to belief, but it's also important. If you believe that you can control the dream world, but you *expect* it to disobey you - then you're going to have a bad time. It doesn't matter if you've failed before - what matters is that you get better! So expect the best scenario. It helps if you visualize it as well.

**Techniques**
If you have problems, try these techniques I use. I don't think they are - in any way - required, but they might be helpful to you.

*Use the dream environment to your advantage*. If you want something, make sure you don't already have it. Dream characters can assist you in various ways, and asking for what you want might make it appear. Stuff you want can also appear where it should. The refrigerator is always stocked. You could also change how gear behaves... who said an umbrella doesn't work as a parachute?

Fetch items from out-of-vision. I can summon things as I please, but making them appear in front of me - out of thin air - is still a challenge. If you want a pen, don't check your pocket - just pull one out! If you expect one to be there, there will be one there. Not looking into containers, but taking what you want, is fairly simple. You could try to feel yourself grabbing what you want in there.

Summon people. The two techniques above have provided useful. If you really can't make people appear on your own, try to ask someone in the dream to lead you to them. Or, why not pull up a phone and call them. I've had success with sticking my right hand behind my back, and expecting the person to grab my hand. And off we go, hand-in-hand.

Change scenery. This can be a little bit tricky, and you need to pull it of in a way that suits you. The *easiest* way would be to find a door, and visualize it leading somewhere you want. You could use anything from riding in a car there to using a portal gun, though. Or fly there.
The harder way would be to realize that the entire dream world is only a hallucination, and you are in fact able to ""re-draw"" the entire canvas. You could destabilize the scene, get into the void, and then rebuild a new scene. I havn't been able to pull that off with good results... yet.
I put a finger to my ear (like I'm trying to hear something from an earbud), and pretend I'm talking to the Operator (The Matrix reference) and tell him where I want to go. It works for me, but it might not work for you.

As i went down to fetch something to drink i felt something weird like something wasn't right, and as i returned something sure enough there was a demon in front of me. what was really weird was i didn't feel scared at all i simply pulled out a knife from somewhere and i stabbed the demon in the throat. I thought ""wow that's pretty cool"" then after that i saw another demon in a screen door with its eyes glowing. still without any fear i took out a shotgun and blew his head off.

I propose that once a month for the next 12 months, I will post ideas on how to improve lucidity, awareness, and dream recall.

So here are the tasks for this month:

* try changing landscapes by using the door method. Summon a door and think to yourself that when you step through the door you will step into that landscape. Keep thinking about it while stepping through it, and youre there!

* be like Spiderman.Swing through the city!

* climb a mountain or building without any materials  and enjoy the breath taking landscapes ( if there are any).

I've had an occasional LD here or there, but have observed some awesome changes in my understanding of dreams:

1.  Reality checks are often misconstrued as a physical mindless action, and even when I finally started doing it correctly (actually questioning my reality), it would not make me LD.

2.  My dream journal helped me drastically, especially in the beginning.  I started getting genuinely interested in increasing general vividness and feelings of dreams, lucid or not.

3.  Taking a break from attempts at LDing would make me have one usually.  When it was hanging in the back of my head, my subconscious let it happen rather than me imposing upon my subconscious to LD.  Don't be afraid to give it a little break sometimes!

4.  Dreams are a great perspective, but also just our mind sputtering images out to the sensory lobes and trying to make a story out of it.  I write in my journal, but only pay attention to reoccurring themes or events.  The sub conscious doesn't really care to explain it's enigmatic mind vomit, creating odd scenarios.

5.  Dreaming and some lucid dreaming has boosted my confidence because 1) at first I was self conscious to write down EVERYTHING that happened in the dream; gaining that skill has helped me in the real world.  And 2) In some LDs I have resolved tensions with people that I wouldn't think to do in real life, a psychological lesson.

NREM. Sleep cycles. You read about WILD and these terms are thrown around - so what the heck do they mean? Hopefully this helps.

While you sleep, your body is not *just* sleeping. It is going through a nuanced series of changes and patterns known as a 'sleep cycle'. Sleep cycles last, on average, about 90 minutes. Here's what happens in that 90 minutes:

Once you fall unconscious (for that is what sleep really is), you enter NREM - non rapid eye movement sleep. We'll get to what REM means exactly a bit later; suffice to say you're not dreaming in NREM. 

Stage 1 of NREM occurs right after you fall asleep, and only has slow eye movement. It is during this stage that brain waves begin to change and hypnic jerks (those annoying twitches you get as you fall asleep) happen. Minimal awareness is maintained, and people awakened from this stage sometimes feel they've been awake, just with their eyes shut, the whole time.

In Stage 2, the eyes calm down, and it's easy to be awakened. EEG's show some funky sleep signals here.

In Stage 3, Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) begins - this just means your brain is quieting down even more. In this stage, dreams begin, but are ordinary and not terribly memorable. All of these stages take about 65 minutes. 

As we leave Stage 3 NREM, REM begins. REM is where most of our dreaming takes place. Our eyes are fluttering around very quickly, and we begin to dream as our brain feeds us random sensory signals and our front brain attempts so make sense of them (or at least that's one theory). REM lasts about 20 minutes (but can feel like hours or days in our minds). After our REM cycle is completed, there is another 5 minutes of NREM, during which we are incredibly easily awakened (think full bladder, creaky house, or those times where you wonder why the heck you woke up randomly).

So what good is that to us? Well, if we map our sleep cycles we find some interesting things out. Foremost, we can figure out the best time to do a WBTB WILD (what that is and the specifics of a successful one are beyond the scope of this tutorial). For the WILD, we want about 4.5-6 hours of sleep completed (read: 3-4 cycles), and to wake up between cycles. Let's assume you go to *sleep* at 10:30 (I italicize sleep because it's not what time you go to bed; you must figure out how long it takes you to go to sleep after you hit the hay). 4.5 hours after that is 3:00 a.m., which gives us 3 cycles - great! We'll set our alarms for 3:00 a.m., wake up, and do a WILD. (Note some people advocate waking up in the MIDDLE of REM to WILD so you can reenter a dream lucid. Usually you can just adjust 15 minutes earlier for this, but YMMV.)

We can take this a step further and work out that, for example, if we stay up for 15 minutes after our 3am wake-up, we'll be out at 3:15a.m. and be done with two more cycles at 6:00a.m. If we can wake up between cycles, the feeling of early morning sleepiness can be banished quite easily. (Note you can just add more cycles and get up at 7:30am, for example.) In fact, sometimes shifting your wake-up 15-30 minutes earlier so it lands at the end of a cycle can feel better than sleeping for 30 minutes more and trying to bust out of a cycle.

[Here's an example of my personal REM map with different bed/sleeptimes](http://pastebin.com/EUBftBrb) - I keep this by my bed and can work out when I should set my alarm(s). I'd encourage you to make one; they help lots!

G'night, and lucid dreams!

You're on your back and completely relaxed. You start to get a little buzzy and disconnected. You've successfully ignored that itch, that terrible terrible itch that suddenly started screaming at you from the tip of your nose. You feel yourself sinking, sinking, sinking as random geometric visuals begin to coalesce into more tangible scenes. And then it hits you: you're **uncomfortable**. You're body is requesting, nay, *demanding* that you roll over on to your side this instant.

Needless to say, **DON'T**! You know damn well that rolling over will break the spell. You might even be back at square one. So what do you do? Ignore the urge, like you ignored the itch? No! Remember, by this point you're practically on the doorstep of a forced dream. So concentrate with all of your might on visualizing yourself in your bed. Visualize your darkened room around you, see the rising and falling of your chest in front of you as you breathe evenly. And then visualize yourself rolling on to your side. Let your 'dream eyes' track across your ceiling and to your wall, bringing into your line of site whatever should be (night stand, etc). Concentrate on the tactile sensation you get on your shoulder and side when you roll over. With a little practice and a little luck, you'll slip into a WILD.

This may sound silly to some of you - to others it may be old hat. For me and many other people I've spoken to, it's a very good tactic for getting past that final stage of being awake and crossing over.

I did a lot of experimenting with ideas I got from this sub-reddit. This most interesting thing I did though popped into my head completely randomly, and it was to look into a mirror. 

At first I simply thought it would be interesting but as I got ready to approach the mirror I started getting nervous and suddenly knew I was not about to see my literal reflection but something else, it felt like I was about to make a confrontation. And in fact I did, what happened next was life changing.

All the most negative parts of me were manifested in this mirror. They were all my most self destructive qualities that I now realize aren't actually part of me, they simply exist inside of me. I learned this by the way they were manifested in the mirror. They looked like me but lifeless, with soul-less eyes. This is how I knew they weren't really me but have only been posing to be me my entire life. 

As I started to realize this the ""reflections"" eyes glowed red. I felt fear but I confronted it, I shouted ""WHAT AM I!"" at the mirror. Then it took off its disguise, its head turned into the most nasty black wolf, with the glow from flames illuminating the inside of its mouth and yellow fangs. In the most penetrating- demonic voice imaginable it roared back at me ""I AM A MONSTER!"". That's when I finally knew that this thing was not really me, only pretended to be me, and it fucked up by ruining its disguise. 

So to me this mirror was a gateway into my own mind. I don't want too say my sub-conscious because this reflection was not me, and had only wished for my self destruction. If you look at your worst qualities you can group them all together and label them as ""the black wolf"". And in the dream world I explored my mind and met face to face with this black wolf.

So last night, I kept trying unsuccessfully throughout the night and meeting people in my dreams, asking them if I was dreaming or not and they said yes I was but I didn't believe them. Finally it worked through WBTB. I was in an old city in a stone castle like building. I was with my friend, he was the one that told me I was dreaming. We were lying down and i finally did reality checks. I realized i could put my hand through my head and i could pinch my nose and still breathe and bam! I got really excited with him and said let's explore. We walked through the castle and I enjoyed jumping through things. I remember seeing a mirror and said let's just jump through it. Not knowing what to expect he was totally game for it. We did and it was dark and I was falling, diving. I covered my head instinctively to protect myself and the darkness became a tunnel. I crawled up and down what felt like a dirt and gravel tunnel and finally entered this chamber space with a bunch of doors. In the center of the chamber was my own heart beating steadily, and behind each door was a room of blood vessels, keeping my unconscious body steadily going while my mind was on adventures. We were both fascinated. They looked and felt like nylon to the touch, not at all slimy but pulsing steadily. I felt my dream self could do anything I wanted in this world and still my heart would beat steadily, reassuring me that i was still lucid dreaming. It was really cool. There was an exit to the outside and there were crazy baboon-like gargoyles along the walls, with red faces and scary manes. I thought how weird my dream world was but I was so excited I was lucid I didn't change much. I remembered I should try flying. I jumped a few times and didn't do so well. Some other people joined us, one looked like my redhead friend. My mom was there too, she was giving me tips on flying. They were expert flyers and told me to take higher and higher leaps until I didn't touch the ground. I tried a few times myself and got as high as one story or so, then felt myself fall. I was trying to harness the feeling itself of being in the air, I was getting better but I couldn't stay up. Finally my redhead friend held my hand and did it with me, and when I faltered I could feel him lift me up even though I pulled him down. I got high enough to land on top of one of the castle turrets. Everyone cheered for me and I was about to do it again when my stupid real life body coughed.

I'm starting off with something simple. A small log cabin in a clearing in the woods. It's a single room with a loft for a bed. When you first walk in there is a large fireplace on the right hand side that has a mantle above it (currently empty) that will some day (night?) hold different memorabilia from my dreams. Under the loft is a single table and chair. Theres also a large chest for me to store things in. 

Every night as I fall asleep I'm going to think of my ""dream"" home in as much detail as possible. If I ever am actually there, Boom! instant lucidity! I'm also going to be doing sketches and floor plans to make sure it stays the same from dream to dream.

The subject matter typically focuses on big picture metaphysical issues and infrequently on personal matters of interest.  

I am always overly polite, introduce myself, and ask if the person would like to talk.  I then explain that we are dreaming and that I would like to ask him/her a few questions.

At that point, the reactions are all over the map.  Some people start crying, others look at me as if I'm from another planet, a few people have sprinted in the opposite direction, and when I'm lucky, the person says, ""Oh yeah, I know we're dreaming.  Go ahead...""

I realize that in most dreams I am speaking with aspects of myself, and for a while I would ask, ""What do you represent?""

I'm reading an advertisement in the local newspaper about an experiment. 
&gt;One person needed for study of brainwaves, 5000 euros for 10 days. Basic knowledge of meditation required.

And a telephone number. Because I'm in need of money and meditate daily, I decide to call. The emotionless voice of an old man gives me an address. He tells me to come as soon as possible. The next day, I take the train to a small village just outside my home town. A man is waiting for me. I think he was about 40 years old, and it was clearly not the one I spoke to on the phone. He greets me and says that he will take me to his father. For a moment I wonder how he knew that I was the one who called. We drive to an house in the woods. He leads me to a room. There's only a bed with some medical equipment next to it, and an old radio. He tells me to lie down, connects some electrode pads to my head and leaves. After a minute I hear the voice of the old man over the radio. This time he speaks more gently. We basically perform a guided meditation, I really enjoy it. After (what feels like) an hour or so, the younger man returns and takes me back to the train station. 

This repeats for about 5 times. One time I ask the man in the car what this experiment is all about. He tells me that the old man and his wife, his parents, are neuroscientists. His mother is dying. The old man believes that he is close to an important discovery and he wants to succeed before his wife dies. Back in the room I lie down for the seventh time. 

As usual, the old man speaks to me, guiding my meditation. About half way through he says: 'There once was a dying man who volunteered to participate in a scientific experiment. We measured his weight with an incredibly accurate scale while he was dying. The results showed that as soon his brain activity became silent, he became a microscopic amount lighter. Since then I believe a man has a soul. Do you know what Lucid Dreaming is?' I said yes, and that I had a couple lucid dreams myself. 'Good, so you know it is possible. What if I told you that another experiment of mine revealed that a brain, just before it dies, shows the same brain activity as one that dreams? Just before you die, you dream. And when that dream is over, your soul leaves your body. *This* experiment is to see if that last dream can be lucid, and if that has any effect on your death. Do you understand?' I was terrified. At least, I tried to be. But I couldn't. I was in such a deep trance that I simply wasn't able to care if I was going to die. 'Yes', I said. 'Good. I am sorry for what I'm about to do to you. My wife is dying, and this is the only chance for me to save her. Goodbye.' Then I hear the hissing sound of a gas. The old man keeps putting me at ease. 'You won't feel pain', he said. I begin to hear voices and I'm shaking. Then I see a bright light. Dying is quite similar to WILDing, I realize. But instead of falling down like I usually do, I float up. I look down and see my body lying on the bed. For a moment everything starts to fade. But then I start spinning, like I normally do when I lose my lucidity in a dream. It works. For a moment I worry that I won't be able to remain on earth and will float in space for the rest of eternity like all the billions of other souls, but again I'm able to use the skills I learned while lucid dreaming to control myself. I fly around and enjoy the view. Eventually, I wake up.

This really was one of the most interesting dreams I've ever had. Of course I adjusted some little things, but the main idea remains the same. Wouldn't it be awesome if this was really how death works? I find the comparison between WILD and death really interesting. People who have had a near dead experience often describe a bright light. When I go WILDing, I see the same. There is even a bit about Lucid Dreaming on the near-death experience Wikipedia page! Check it out: [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-death_experience#Lucid_dreaming).

I went to bed at 11:30 and set an alarm for 4:00. When I woke up at 4 I used the bathroom and then tried the technique. Unfortunately, as some other people have noticed, I would begin to feel the sucking feeling of being pulled into the dream, and I would get super excited which would wake me up immediately. I tried this for around 15 min, after which instead of being closer to dreaming I was completely wide awake.

I ended up tossing and turning for the next 45 min. During that time I was doing RC's basically every time I rolled over (but not doing the FILD technique). Eventually an RC worked, and I realized I was dreaming. Not exactly how it was supposed to work, but at least I got an LD. It was more of a standard WBTB technique.

For anyone attempted FILD, my advice would be

1. Make sure you're super tired when you wake up -- I normally get up at 6:30 so perhaps 4:00 was too late in the morning
2. Don't move once you wake up, just turn off your alarm and then start the finger motion

The grass was vibrantly green.  Leaves were falling off the trees.  I couldn't make out what was in the distance.  I walked further to find that I was actually in the field by my house.  The baseball diamond was there. Up the embankment was the big swingset that kids are always swinging, hanging on, or otherwise risking their necks around.

For some strange reason there stood a large disembodied wall in the middle of the field.  It looked like a morgue wall, housing many of the 7-foot long stainless steel drawers used for housing cadavers.  I immediately recognized that this wasn't right.

I pinched my nose, closed my mouth and tried to breathe in through my pinched nose; my favorite reality check.  There it was.  I breathed in, as if through some other hole in my head.  Ah!  Let's not waste time.

I did my quick math: 2x6=12.  14-8=6.  13x2=... ""ah, it's hard to do this when I'm not really that lucid. Keep trying.""  26.  

I reached down to touch the grass and feel it.  All of this was increasing my lucidity to where I wanted it.  Things felt vibrant and *stable*.  It's important to do things like this which wake up your faculties and increase your level of lucidity.  When you sleep normally, so much is shut down.  When you gain lucidity, you have to try to oil those gears and get things running.  Touching something and doing math only take about 10 seconds; a small price to pay for clear, strong lucidity.

Okay.  Now what?

Here is my story.",AnalGeneral,59,13,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/19c31h/today_is_the_first_time_i_hear_of_lucid_dreaming/,"Hello to all of you Lucid Dreamers.
Before reading: I’m a 20 years old male, and today is the first time I ever hear of this subreddit and also lucid dreaming. I checked out a couple of links before posting and I felt like I could relate. 

I don't have a date of when I started dreaming like this. It came as a natural thing at first. In periods where I thought life was a bit depressing  I would lay in bed at night and think of how I wish my life was. So I started dreaming. It sounds so sad, but my life isn’t that sad. I just feel very lonely from time to time, and I think a lot of people do, even if you have plenty of friends. It's no wonder that I would feel lonely, since I don't have a girlfriend, and I never had. I just have a hard time getting really close to girls. Anyways, that's the backstory.

It usually starts out when I’m laying in bed, kind of ""daydreaming"" about something nice or something I thought of earlier and progressively as I am still controlling the dream, suddenly everything feels alive and real, with feelings and emotions. I can do whatever I want and be whoever I want. Next thing I know I wake up in bed and the only thing that remain is an empty, but strong feeling of what was seemed so real. Most of my dreams strive for that feeling of mutual love, which I haven't experienced yet. I can control it pretty well, but I do it only in short periods (maybe 2-3 nights in a row) and then a few months can pass, it varies. 

Dreaming has become a way to access feelings that I wish I would feel in my every day. I'm not sure how healthy it is, as it can relate to depression. But on the other hand it also feels like my instinct is reminding me what matters the most.

Not every one of my dreams is lucid, and when they are I don't necessarily have much control over what happens other than my own actions. But its something I'm familiar with even now, so when I found this subreddit I thought I should try and concentrate on controlling my lucid dreams. I don't believe it will be very difficult, I have discovered ways by myself to keep a dream going. For instance when I feel a dream becoming 'shallow' I can somehow push myself back into it, so that I won't wake up, but I'm still a ways off from totally controlling this ability. 

So after some reading of these techniques here I decided to try WILD I believe. I'm not sure if I was doing it right but I lay on my back arms by my sides and legs slightly spread in a natural and comfortable position. I just focused on letting my body sink away, its pretty hard since I'm naturally quite fidgety. my body will itch in various places which can be intensely hard to ignore, any tips on how one can overcome the urges to move would be greatly appreciated.

Regardless it didn't take long for something to happen, and boy did it happen. Now I'm no stranger to sleep paralysis, I have had it before but had no idea how to describe it or explain it, I would simply refer to it as 'intense terror.' This time it was different though, I knew now that it was sleep paralysis and that it was normal and safe. This however, was by far the most intense sleep paralysis that I have ever experienced. It hit me like a ton of bricks, I had intense auditory and visual hallucinations, my cousin who sleeps in the same room began to scream in a demonic fashion and there were figures all over the room. I tried to tell my brain to calm down and I tried to relax but in the end the intensity brought me back up. 

I felt I was right there about to break out the room into a lucid dream, I can normally flap my arms and fly over houses and trees, but as soon as it crossed my mind that I was about to have lucidity I got sucked into sleep paralysis.
 
I am going to try again tonight, the main factor for me is not moving. I would like to know if anyone has any techniques or methods for ignoring these impulses, mostly the random urge to scratch some part of your body. 
I believe I can control the sleep paralysis, even with the intensity, but any helpful tips on how someone can get past that would be much appreciated.

Tl;dr how do I resist the urge to move, particularly the urge to scratch a part of my body thus causing a delay in the time it takes my body to sleep.









EDIT: a few hours after I wrote the above I tried going for a mid day siesta. I have a day off to mess around so I thought why not? I lay there while my cousin watched tv in the same room, it was a game show so just noise to me.. I lay completely still, and attempted to consciously drop off. After a while I just fell asleep for what must have been 30-40 minutes, at that point my cousin woke me, he's an annoying bastard so this was inevitable. After telling him to shut it I lay back down and kept still once again, this time it was different though. It must have been because I had already slept for a certain period of time, but I sank straight into sleep. I felt my body paralyze but I didnt experience full blown sleep paralysis, it went past that and then the dream formed. 
Basically I was standing in the room by the bed I was sleeping in, nobody was there so I knew I was dreaming because my cousin and I had been there. I didn't move because I wanted to let the dream get deeper, I felt I could wake really easily. The room was amazingly detailed and weirdly I could hear the tv the whole time, this enforced in me the fact that the dream was shallow. I began to lose some control when I began being 'pushed' backwards and forwards in the room by an invisible force. I didn't fight it but remained as still as possible. After a bit of this I left the room into the hallway, it was also beautifully reconstructed and I began to regain some control over my movement. I slowly raised my arms and put my hands together in front of me,  at this point though, the dream became really weak and the tv got louder. I returned to the first room to try and stabalize it but it was a lost cause, I surfaced to my bed pretty quickly after that..

This was the first time I had closed my eyes and willfully induced a lucid dream, before they just kind of happened, I'm glad it worked. I think the best time to try it is in the morning when you first wake up, this is the time where I've had most of mine. If you have a day off go to bed late and when you wake, try willfully inducing it. I still have a lot of work to do trying to control and stabilize the dream while I'm in it. It's pretty amazing that you can train these things in your brain, I wonder how far you can take it though, is it possible to control every aspect? Or will some things always be random?

I'm on my second, soon to be third month of WILD.",Humble_harpdarp,60,12,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/10de2o/tips_and_a_very_basic_tutorial_for_wilders_im_on/,"I probably have a few spelling errors, I wrote this on a mobile device. I just made these last night and thought itd be a useful post, as a lot of this community avoids WILD.


(Please note, not all of this applies to everyone, and this is all completely based off of my own experiences)



1.You may not even get to sp your first, second, third, fourth, or even fifth try. It's a lot harder then it looks, im on month 2 and still mastering it, but you may get it in a week or so, it depends on many factors.

2. If you spend more then an hour on one WILD attempt, give up and try again later. I once sat there for literally 3 hours sweating and feeling terribly uncomfortable  hoping for sleep paralysis. Don't do this, you'll just waste time.

3. Refrain from using electronics an hour before going to sleep.

4. Naps help, like, a lot. I also reccomend sleeping 15 minutes before WILDING if you do it during a nap. Also, your hallucinations might  get less scary during day time.

5. Always use WBTB before trying to WILD. It else you'll just be wasting your time. Even though it's possible to get an ld without WBTB, it will be significantly less vivid.

8. Be prepared for some really scary hallucinations. It's hard to overcome them, but you may end up with really peaceful hallucinations (voices, sound of rivers, lights) I've had some in the past that made me cry from the sheer beauty of it. I wouldn't expect these though, be prepared for the bad ones.

9. Don't open your eyes during sleep paralysis. Trust me. Seriously. 

10. I've found switching from a bed to a couch halfway in the night helps, especially if the couch is less comfortable.

11. A lot of rutorials I read didnt point out that when WILDING, you won't be completely conscious for the whole process. There should be a stage where you enter a completely trancelike state. This will be an absolutely amazing experience. One time I laid in this for an hour, and it literally only felt like a few minutes. Another time, I thought an entire night had passed, but only 4 minutes had. ( I came to right at the end of a song)

Now, an extremely basic tutorial:
1. Lay down.
2. Don't move at all, you may have to swallow, if so go ahead and do it just don't focus too hard on it.
3. You'll start to feel sensations, your hands/feet may twitch a bit.
4. You'll feel like a lead blanket was put over your whole body, this is where the hard part starts (this isn't sleep paralysis)
5. Here's the hard part. You'll need to clear your mind completely while remaining barely conscious. Your inner voice needs to be gone. This takes a lot of practice, so I reccomend meditating once a day to get used to it.
8. You'll need an anchor to pull you out of your trance once you cleared your mind. Music works for this, so long as its really patterned and you can listen to it passively. At the end of the song, it'll wake your mind back up because the sudden silence will surprise you.

9. If everything worked, when you come out of your trance you'll be in sleep paralysis. Be prepared for the hallucinations, there is no turning back now, cause you can't move.
10. Focus on the blackness of your minds eye. Might see stuff form before your eyes, don't try to interact with it yet, patience is important here. Keep conscious and wait until the dream becomes your surroundings. Note: It may seem this part failed and you'll find yourself leaning up still in bed or whatever. Do a reality check, false awakenings happen a lot at this point, and they can be extremely realistic, and the transition from awake to dream can be so fast you don't even recall blinking. Do some stabilization techniques and enjoy your lucid dream! Good luck!


Oh, and one last tip: position is very important. If you go into sp with your hand on your neck, it may feel like you're choking yourself to death.

I've been on this subreddit for a while, but have never had any really serious attempts at LDing, i just like to read the stories of people who have taken is seriously and have had success. That being said, I realized how powerful LDing can be in terms of mental benefits.

Back in November, my friend bob's father committed suicide. He was a victim of Bi-polar disorder, which added to the burden of like for bob, his sister and mother. 

In the weeks that passed, bob was mourning the loss of his father. He had been very close to a father (probably closer to him than anyone else) and some of you probably know what it's like to have lost someone like that. He wasn't showing any signs of depression outside of those of someone who was mourning, but on several occasions told me of dreams he had where his father was there.

It came to a point though, where he said that keeping his father in his dreams was holding him back. He wanted to get past his father's death (this was around the beginning of February) however he still had dreams about him. This is when I got him into LDing.

It was 3 weeks of nonstop encouragement, where we had no success. Reality checks, MILD, and WBTB. Finally, a LD came his way. That day in school, he was calm. Not like the ""Nothing's wrong here"" calm, but a state of relief. He told me that in his dream he was out hunting with his father. There they sat, and I guess talked. He told me that he told his father he wanted to move on, and his father said that was fine.

It's about 2 months since then, and I feel like I've helped him change his life dramatically; He tried out for the baseball team and made JV, got a new girlfriend and they are perfect for another. This morning he told me that he couldn't thank me enough for helping him. He said I had turned his life around by helping him come to terms with his father and that those months following his father's death had secretly been filled by depression and even suicidal thoughts of his own.

I've learned the power of LDing indirectly, and urge you, especially if you are struggling to come to terms with anything:

1334673082.0,47,self.LucidDreaming,se8bt,Tried supplements.  LDd for the first time.  Only lasted 5-6 seconds. ,Mauldrich,57,10,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/se8bt/tried_supplements_ldd_for_the_first_time_only/,"I wanted to post my experience because I have seen spatterings of people that have mentioned taking Melatonin and B6 but there wasn't a lot of experiences with it.  So I thought I'd post my findings in case there is anyone else looking for information on the subject.  

To start, I'm not an expert on supplements.  I don't claim to have any knowledge that you should trust.  Read up on it yourself and know what you're taking.  With that said, Melatonin occurs naturally in the body.  It helps you sleep.  B6 is a vitamin that helps the nervous system in some way (according to the bottle).  I normally see it in energy drinks as well.  

Last night, I was in the grocery store getting a couple things for dinner the next evening.  I remembered I wanted to try this out.  I went to the supplement section and had the following choices.

Melatonin - 5mg or 10mg. (I chose 5mg)

B6 - 100mg or 250mg (I chose 100mg)

I chose the lowest in both supplements as I didn't know what, if anything, it would do to me.  About 30min before bed, I took one of each.  Not expecting anything, I watched the last 30min of the hockey games before bed.  About 20min after taking the two supplements I could feel the effects of the Melatonin.  I felt very relaxed and had a couple passes of very light dizziness.  Not enough to cause nausea or anything.  Just enough to say, ""It's time for bed.""

Going to bed, I was not prepared for what I wanted to try to do.  MILD or WILD.  I have tried both with no success.  For a little background, I've been reading on Lucid dreaming for about a month or two.  I'm excited to eventually get to a point where I can LD often.  Before this night I had not LDd since I was a child.  

Below I will tell you the entire story and then give pros and cons from my experiment. The times I give are guess-timations because I didn't open my eyes to look at the clock.

Ok..  So I go to bed..  I decide to try WILD.  I get comfortable and stayed still.  After about 15-20min, my appendages start to tingle and my left foot would annoyingly twitch every 5 min or so.  I try and fight through it and the sensation changes.  My arms and legs change from tingling to almost a light pain mixed with cramping.  I look at this as my brain testing me and I find this is the hardest stage for me to get through.  After about an hour goes by, my ears start ringing.  The ringing slowly get louder but not overpowering.  At one point my mind wandered a bit and I noticed a series of what sounded like electronic tones.  Like the tones of a hearing test only louder.  I didn't notice them right away. Right after they happened, this focused me a bit as I have read that noises were another stage of WILD.  At this point, I started visualizing things.  I had problems though.  Nothing was defined.  Everything I'd see was not quite there.  It was a little frustrating.  Occasionally, a person would pop in and pop out extremely faded.  I tried thinking to myself that I wanted things to get brighter and have more clarity.  It was wavering in and out.  I was continually trying to see my hands but couldn't make them out.  I was hoping to rub them together.  Nothing..  I did get it a little brighter..  But there was nothing to light up at the time.. I started to wander again and then all of a sudden... 

I was standing on a small grassy hill.  I could hear the wind blowing lightly through the trees.  The sky was a deep purple and blue.  Like a storm was on the horizon.  I looked up and there was the biggest zeppelin I have ever seen.  It was metallic looking and I could hear the buzzing on the fan engines on the rear of the aircraft.  It was moving slowly and effortlessly away from me and from left to right.  As soon as I appeared, I immediately realized I had made it into an LD and looked down at my hands.  I tried to rub my hands together and woke from my LD.  The whole LD lasted 5 to 6 seconds.  I was disappointed and excited at the same time.  I then went to sleep as I had been up for a couple hours.  I think if I can make it to that point again, I will sit in grass and focus on the grass until I'm stable.  

I woke up in the morning felling normal.  Not really rested.  But not tired.

The point of my post was to give the noticeable differences with taking the Melatonin and B6.  So here they are.

*The 5mg of Melatonin was sufficient to make me sleep.  However, because it took me so long to get into the LD, I felt like the relaxing effect faded after an hour or so after laying down.  I think I will take it right before bed the next time I try it.

*My initial thoughts of the 100mg of B6 was that it was too much.  I think it prevented me from falling deeper into sleep.  But the positive side was that it kept me focused and aware with little effort the entire time.  In contrast, when I did try WILD without the supplements, I attempted to use the counting method to stay aware.  I had the hardest time counting after a while.

*Technically, this worked for me.  I had an LD in 1 night after a month or two of reading and trying different things that, while getting better, did not get me to an LD.

When I try this again, the only thing I might change is the B6.  I might try 50mg rather than 100mg.

Anyway, wanted to share.  Happy dreaming..

TL:DR - Experimented with 5mg Melatonin/ 100mg B6 supplements.  Had an LD for 5-6 seconds. Seems to produce results.  Might try less B6.",,False,,t5_2r0f4,True,,,True,t3_se8bt,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/se8bt/tried_supplements_ldd_for_the_first_time_only/,

I then, for the first time ever in a dream, pinched my nose and tried breathing through it... and I did! It was the craziest feeling ever, breathing through my nose when I know I shouldn't be able to. I spent a few minutes relishing this feeling and the fact that I knew I was dreaming. I could feel the dream starting to fall apart though. My peripheral vision consisted of colorful static and it was slowly obstructing my view further. I fought off waking up and tried to just go with the flow. I walked in the kitchen and somehow (I don't remember how) I talked my mom into not killing me. I'm a little fuzzy on the details after that, but I know I ended up outside with a giant, wooden sledgehammer. After willing the weather to be perfect, I proceeded to play life-size whack-a-mole in my front yard. I think I kind of lost control and was afraid to do what I want and risk waking up. After a while I sat down, enjoyed the perfect weather for a few minutes, then woke up.

It's so weird looking back on it. It's like a memory I just can't quite remember all of. I most clearly remember the feeling of breathing through my pinched nose. Simply amazing. I did not try to lucid dream at all and it did not even cross my mind in the last few days.

I normally sleep with a pillow on both sides of me, but last night was my second without them. I figured I would see what it was like without them. I know when I sleep at hotels or a friends house I usually have more vivid dreams and remember them better. Do you think this lucid dream could have came from my changed sleeping arrangements?

Some background: I have a bunch of friends who smoke, and I picked up a little smoking habit of my own for about 9 months. Not much, maybe 3-5 cigarettes a day. Awful, awful stuff; please don't start smoking, ever! I finally said, enough is enough, I'm not a smoker and don't want to be one, and picked up some patches from Amazon. I don't smoke anymore except socially with those same friends (I never buy my own, in other words, which was the biggest hurdle to get past).

I left one on when I went to sleep, as I thought that's what you're supposed to do. WOW. Most intense, lucid dreams I've ever had, without trying or even knowing that Lucid Dreaming was a real thing.

Anyway, it might be worth trying out. You can buy the ""step 1"" which is the strongest stuff but more importantly it's the cheapest, and then cut then into halves or quarters (they say ""oh you can't do that, it ruins the whatever"" but it doesn't).

I'm not a doctor, so I don't feel I should be *recommending* this, but it I felt it was worth reporting!

I've had all sorts of intense dreams this way and I'm not sure if they're completely or technically ""lucid"" but they're much *much* more lucid and vivid than usual. I've had dreams where I've been at parties and did whatever I want. Then there was one where I rented a BMW M6, drove to California for some family summer camp retreat thing, then the car beeped at me because it thought it was stolen and ... drove itself back home. They were giving away free candy at the mall. And a stripper was teaching an advanced math class at college.

The incongruency of the things you want in your dream and the possibility of them happening in real life keeps your mind from actually giving you those things to you. 

This thread is meant to teach how to do things you want to in your dreams through experiences IRL. We all know our dream material comes from messed up fragments of real life and experiences that we have. So, to do something in your dream your mind doesn't let you do it, you have to get ""imaginary tools"". Ways to fool your mind into believing the plausability of the thing you want!

That might be a little abstract to understand, so I'll give you guys an example of what happened to me.

I was flying with a jetpack in a dream. While I was flying, I noticed it was a dream, and this made my jetpack lose its power. I could not fly anymore, I could just jump really high. It's ""impossible"" to fly, so I could not.

In this very same dream, in order to fly, I had an idea. If I could not fly by myself, i'd fly riding a flying creature. My first thoughts were a flying dragon. But how could I summon a dragon? It's as possible as flying.

I shouted Odahviing! It's a reference from a game called Skyrim. In the game logic, the shouts are reality, so I can shout in the dream. As soon as I shout, a flying dragon appears. I mount that dragon, tell him to glue my legs into a saddle he had in his torso, and I could fly while casting lightining bolts (the lightning bolts are from skyrim aswell).

In order to have these kinds of tools, you need to put ""crap"" in your brain. Play videogames, rpg, watch movies, and read fantasy books or comic books. 

Now, for those who want a list of things that were usefull for me in my dream, take a look:

**Games:**

* Tiberian Sun - *Jetpack units that could fly. Lost power after lucid, but remained active because of another game.*^normal ^dream

* Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War - *High jump jetpacks.*^lucid ^dream

* Skyrim: *Summoning a dragon through a thu'um (magic shout), casting lightning bolts with my bare hands.*^lucid ^dream

* Mirror's Edge: *I could literally climb a really tall building and walk over walls without falling. It's more fun than flying.*^normal ^dream

* Warcraft III and WoW: *Fuck there are a lot of spells there.*^normal ^dream

* Call of Duty, Battlefield: *Great for war themed dreams.*^normal ^dream

**Movies:**

* Matrix: *Shitload of lucid dreaming material, really. The similarity between the film's subject and lucid dreaming makes it all very easy to use. I've dodged bullets, last dream I was invulnerable to falling from high places (this is very useful. The dragon I was riding dropped me), summoning loads of weapons and kung fu, ninja fighting material. Teleportation aswell.*^normal ^and ^lucid ^dream

* Harry Potter: *Do I need to say anything? To get a wand, take a stick from a tree or look into your wardrobe for your travelling suitcase.*^normal ^dream

* Saving Private Ryan: *Great for war themed dreams.*^normal ^dream

**RPG**

* *This is very particular to the game you are playing. I was able to summon a wolf in a non lucid dream, after playing GURPS.*^normal ^dream

**Books and Comic Books**

* Out of the Silent Planet: *Good if you want to explore mars!*^normal ^dream

* Harry Potter: *Duh*^normal ^dream

* Sandman: *I once dreamed I WAS sandman, it wasn't a lucid dream, but it was awesome!*^normal ^dream

* X-Men: *A superpower buffet.*^normal ^dream

**Anyway**, You have a wide range of ""tools"" (let's call it **LDtools**) to put inside your mind. Just fill it with crap and you'll be lucid dreaming like a boss. Those are some examples that I've used in my dreams, being them lucid or normal. 

The more things you have in your mind, the more options you have to try to do things. If your brain does not let you breathe fire, try picking a flamethrower. If your brain doesn't want you to summon an elephant, teleport to africa, pick one up and teleport back.

*Edit: The superscripts are the way I found out about them, not that you can't use it in another way.*

**If anyone have other great LDtools, please share them in the comments!**

So, much like everyone else, I saw that FILD is becoming the next big thing in Lucid Dreaming, and as someone who has yet to have much success, I thought I would give this a go.

However, when I tried this previous evening, I failed miserably.

And so, I have a few questions that I hope you all, the good people of r/LucidDreaming, could help this old soul with.

1.) Around what time would be best to wake up to perform FILD? I have tried looking this up, only to find conflicting results.

2.) How do you deal with racing, disorganized thoughts? I know that you are meant to focus on the technique itself, but I would find that by trying to focus on that, I would be uncontrollably preoccupied with pretty much anything else, such as a song or video.

3.) At what tempo should you 'move' your fingers?

4.) What methods have you found to be most effective for calming down? Every time I tried FILD, my breathing to be rather fast, which may have contributed to my failure.
