I feel that it’s a step in the right direction in just about every way.  HOWEVER, I can’t help notice that the entire community seems to be a young group who brag about how they are detaching themselves from commercialism and how this is ‘exactly the amount of space I need to be happy’ bla bla bla but at the end of the day they are just starting out.  What’s it going to be like when the newness of it all is gone and no one is impressed anymore?  

I’d like to hear from someone who has lived in one of these houses for &gt;5 years.  Anyone lived in a small space their entire life?  How has it affected you?  How has it changed the way you live with others?  Living with someone else and in 150ft^2 especially seems like it could get brutal.

Want to live in a trailer in city limits?  Illegal.  Can't do so on your own land, you have to live in the trailer park.  Trailers are for poor people, peasant.

Want to have your own power?  Illegal.  All houses within city limits must attach to the grid.  Pay $20k for a meter and drop, peasant.

Want to have a humanure composting system?  Illegal.  You need to pay $10k in order to have an inspected septic system with a leach field that flushes all that nitrogen into the nearest river instead, peasant.

Want to collect your own water, and not attach to the city water mains?  Illegal.  Pay $20k for a water tap, peasant.

The perspective right now on this is ""do it under the radar, hide your house on your own land so an aerial survey doesn't catch you, move a trailer 10 feet every 30 days to get around the restrictions, hide in someone else's backyard, etc.  All of these carry the risk of fines, house confiscation / destruction, and jail if some bureaucrat toady has a bad day.

The focus of /r/tinyhouses **must** be first on changing local laws and finding which locales have laws amenable to tiny houses, not how to break them and not get caught, and it should *definitely* stop focusing on ""ZOMG what a cute house design!"" unless it is as a means to an end to help people build that house in their area.

IMHO, the gold standard of law that we should shoot for is to be able to live in a tiny house on a trailer or foundation on your own land in city limits, with no water/sewer/electrical connection required and to be able to use a humanure composting toilet.

1345481914.0,60,self.TinyHouses,yj47t,DIY tiny house on a trailer that looks cute but has several serious safety violations...,jlbraun,78,18,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/yj47t/diy_tiny_house_on_a_trailer_that_looks_cute_but/,"[Link to house on THB here.](http://tinyhouseblog.com/yourstory/tiny-casita/)

**Reposting my comment here as THB has a history of deleting / not approving any posts that point out safety problems.**

Holy $DEITY.  This is bad bad bad.

""Also, the metal studs have sharp edges that may cut the wires. I went ahead and duck taped each opening that will have wires passing through.""

Aiee!  Using metal studs for wiring without using the insulating bushings or MC-type wire required by HUD code?  Fire risk.  Shock risk given the metal studs.  This goes double as vibration from moving it on the road will wear through the duct tape in no time.  If the metal studs are not completing a circuit back to the ground at the breaker box, half the house's metal could be at 120VAC and not trip a breaker!

Secondly, those outlets appear to be in the kitchen area as indicated on the drawing.  They are not GFCIs per NEC requirements!  Shock risk.

Third, the use of polyisocyanurate panels is somewhat questionable given the high levels of toxic fire retardants needed in them.  Traditional fiberglass insulation would have been less toxic.

Lastly, the structural framing looks a little suspect, especially at the top plate.  HUD and most building codes require a double top plate but steel may be different. 

I don't think I've seen a single owner-built tiny house without at least one glaring safety oversight.  The fact that I was able to find this many in just a few pictures means that there are certainly many more.

If you don't know about wind loading, fire code, electrical code, etc., then don't think that you can save money by figuring this stuff out on the fly!  Get a pro to install your cute wood stove or electric, and get an engineer to look at your structure.  Yes, you'll pay more for it, but you are still saving money by building tiny!

I like the overall look of the house however.

They're out of Spring, Texas.

Can't say I'm a fan of the faux brick exterior and I don't like the placement of the AC unit.  But hey, they included a washer/dryer hookup!  This is my biggest complaint when I see tiny houses - most of them lack W/D hookups and even AC units.

Nice kitchen counter space but I'd want a double sink and I'd want to lose one of the kitchen windows and put up some cabinets.

And it comes with solar! But not the batteries.  I don't see many coming with solar already installed, so this is pretty cool, IMO.

Would like to see the side walls go a little higher before the roof slope for some more headroom in the loft - every inch probably makes a huge difference.

I can't believe these guys don't do a video tour of the model, either.  They can do it right on their smartphone.  I can't understand why builders don't do this, IMO there's really no excuse for this.

1368946931.0,59,self.TinyHouses,1emcx6,Let me address some of your questions...,DrObotnik,65,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/1emcx6/let_me_address_some_of_your_questions/,"I've noticed a lot of the same questions/themes/misconceptions on /r/tinyhouses and felt I could shed some light on them for you.

* 1)  The most popular topic is the issue of finding a place to permanently park a tiny home built on a trailer. And everyone answers in the same (correct) way: you have to check local building ordinances to see where in a municipality you can park it, and typically you can't park it in city limits.  

Now, you can fight this, banding together and getting petitions signed and then 6 months later you still won't be able to park your TH.  The problem is that you're trying to put up a completed home without construction inspections.  You cannot get around that.  Provided your tiny home meets *minimum* code requirements, you can build tiny onsite, getting a permit and then going through all required inspections.  This is something I don't get--the IRC Res. Code clearly defines that you need a kitchen, bath, and 120sf of living space/person for a house.  The code book literally tells you exactly how small you can build your house (and it's damn small).  That brings me to the next point...

* 2)  The second most popular topic is how municipal codes discriminate against poor people and inspectors don't want you to build.  

Nowhere in the IRC Res. Code does it state that you have to use standard construction materials for your home and spend a lot of money. The code book gives specifications for, uh, specific materials.  It also states that exceptions to these specifications are allowed if approved by either an engineer or the codes inspector.  Now, codes inspectors are very wonderful people (because they are just people!), and they like working *with* builders on unique projects.  It's also their *job* to tell you how to use different materials appropriately.  Here's a tip: you can use license plates as roofing shingles--just ask first!

* 3)  Another popular topic is the idea that it would be great to live together in a community and somehow share the land, but how would we get around zoning requirements and live how we want to live?  

What you're thinking of is a housing cooperative, and I've not seen this mentioned anywhere on the subreddit.  If you don't know, a group of people with a common goal (homeownership) bands together to form a cooperative corporation, which can then borrow money (from a credit union, another form of cooperative) to purchase property.  You can then apply for a rezoning application for your property, set your own rules for determining waste management, grid access, home size, and even materials (like an HOA).

It's amazing that no one comes to this conclusion, perhaps because no one has studied land development/construction management.  When a development group decides they want to build a subdivision, they have to propose to the municipality how they'll take care of their waste water (will they pay to run new sewer lines or will they require septic?  or can they have an environmental engineer propose a large-scale natural filtration system?) and how they'll provide clean drinking water (pay for municipal hook up or mandate well-drilling? Can they guarantee potable water from harvested rainwater?  Let's see an engineer's approval)  Which brings me to the last point...

* 4)  I also keep hearing how we have to band together against the status quo--which typically translates to standing up to bureaucratic nonsense. 

This is like saying, ""I'm going to fight Monsanto by growing my own genetically modified corn""  or, ""I'm going to take down Halliburton by not bombing an impoverished country.""  Or something like that, I'm having a hard time getting a solid comparison.

The key is to actually *compete* in the very arena you're trying to change (now I have a good comparison for this): it's like politics, because it is.  If you think things should be one way, you don't stand on a street corner and yell, you go register to run for public office and then you find your supporters to vote you in.  If you want to compete against traditional suburban and urban developers (because that's who you're fighting, not municipalities or codes), you have to become the developer who does the unconventional.  Because all that bureaucratic nonsense is just a paper game--you can do anything you want as long as, on paper, you've met all the requirements.  

I wrote my culminating university project on exactly this topic: cooperative housing economies, alternative construction, and sustainable developments.  You have more leeway and freedom than you think.  Know the lines, then read between them.

What space saving features do you think tiny houses should employ to retain functions while using a lot less space than a conventional house. I see things like:

*Ladders instead of stairs

*Loft beds with a desk or couch or something underneath (basically any two places where you don't need to stand being stacked)

*Wet rooms instead of an enclosed shower within a bathroom.

*Forgoing DVD and book collections for digital media.

I think most of those are fairly obvious, but in a video posted here recently, I saw a draining board, which would normally take up counter space, substituted with a rack suspended above the sink.

1340210311.0,55,self.TinyHouses,vc2he,Work Exchange- live and work in my tiny house/cabin just outside of Yellowstone ,lumpytrout,62,7,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/vc2he/work_exchange_live_and_work_in_my_tiny_housecabin/,"Hello Tiny House fans, my name is Joel and my family owns a small farm in Montana just outside of Yellowstone Park on the Yellowstone River in the heart of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.  I’ve slowly been working on my tiny house/cabin on the farm for years but now with two young children I’ve come to the realization that although I love this type of work I just don’t have the time to finish it.  
So I am offering a work trade for free rent in our rustic but fully furnished two bedroom cabin all utilities included.  This includes firewood, trash, water and power bills paid and a small stipend for other expenses in return for 40 hours of work per MONTH, giving you lots of time to enjoy the area and pursue other interests and try out the tiny house lifestyle.  The cabin will be available from late August 2012 through June 2013.
**What we offer:** [I’ve put together a tumblr page with photos of the farm and cabin](http://millersbottom.tumblr.com/) (affectionately known as ‘the cabana’ it is the first photo on the page).  There has been a fair amount of work done on the exterior since these photos were taken but this should give you the general idea.  I’m working on getting some more interior photos now, it is cozy but rustic.  It is a total of 650sf and includes [2 bedrooms,](http://i.imgur.com/pcbgP.jpg) a full sized kitchen with full sized appliances, [a new 80% efficient woodstove.](http://i.imgur.com/LkMob.jpg)  [The bathroom has a composting toilet and a bath made from a converted watering trough.](http://i.imgur.com/xZKCU.jpg)  Water is via a 55 gallon solar drum which is filled with non-potable water and water for cooking generally needs to be bought in town.  The town of [Gardiner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardiner,_Montana) is about 5 miles away and offers most of the basic other stuff you will need gas/groceries/laundry/wifi etc.  There are also several [world famous hot springs](http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.aspx?trailid=HGR211-031) nearby that offer year round soaking when you need it.  If you are interested in any type of outdoor activities from hiking and biking to kayaking and skiing this is clearly the motherland and the location is the best thing we have to offer.  There is enough room for two of you if this is something that a couple would be interested in.

**What we need:** We have a long list of tasks that we need help on but mostly general handyman/farm projects and carpentry .  Must have a general knowledge of power tools and tool safety and willingness to try new things.  Email is generally the easiest way to communicate so a laptop and digital camera are helpful.  Although we have other family that live on the farm that can help out in a pinch, you will generally be dealing with me 750 miles away in Seattle, so you will be on your own to prioritize projects and problem solve but I'm available to guide you through any problems. 
 
**BONUS:** If any of this seems familiar, it’s because I’ve posted here before and there is a random Redditor out there right now coming to the end of his adventure.  He has been working for the last 5 months on projects ranging from stucco siding to bike repair.  He is somewhat available to answer questions but he dropped his laptop in the river last week so communication has gotten a little sketchy.  He is working on getting some interior photos together but clearly this has gotten challenging.
If you are interested, please send an email to millersbottom(at)gmail dot com.  You don’t have to send me a resume, but I would like to hear about you, what your interests are and why this project interests you.  Your letter should include a timeline of when this would work for you, your skills and experience, how would this would work for you financially (money in savings, a job you can do from anywhere, will apply for jobs nearby etc) and whatever else you may need to make this happen (tools etc).  Please also include contact info for 3 references (they won’t be contacted unless you are a finalist and I will let you know before contacting anyone).

questions?  Fire away!

**edit** Deadline for applications is 6/28/12

**edit 2** good guy 1over6bil was kind enough to send us video tours of the [outside](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzZIJpiFt0A&amp;feature=youtu.be) and the [inside](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkwR28bSkWA&amp;feature=youtu.be) so please give him some upvotes.  As you can see from the videos most of the updating needs to happen on the inside, paint, drywall, trim etc.

**edit 3** Thanks for your input everyone.  This opportunity is now closed.  We will be making a decision and getting in touch with candidates over the next week.

Living Large in Small Spaces


Homeownership is the “American dream,” and it’s quite apparent that we are comfortable with dreaming big. Americans have always built the largest homes on the planet.

Recently, however, there has been a quiet undercurrent bucking that trend. Some have questioned what all of this extra space is really buying us (apart from a larger mortgage). Some among us are wondering if there isn’t a better way of living out there.

1350266880.0,43,self.TinyHouses,11hoqs,"I'm studying to be an engineer, but architecture is my passion. I've got an optimization question: how would you design the most efficient tiny house?",zippycorners,52,9,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/11hoqs/im_studying_to_be_an_engineer_but_architecture_is/,"With things like engines, conveyor belts, bridges and other junk like that, it's fairly easy to pick things that you want to optimize and design the perfect object. If you want a car with lots of horsepower, you can do that. If you want a car with lots of torque, you can do that. If you want a car with great gas mileage, you can do that. Or you can pick a happy medium and design something in-between. The only stipulation (in the U.S. at least) are safety laws and regulations on cars and roads and emissions.

So anyway, I'm more familiar with cars than I am with houses, but I'm curious what other things could be optimized in a tiny house (either on a trailer or not), and how you would go about designing that with respect to building codes or trailer codes?

The things that stick out to me right off the bat are:

* Open Space
* Storage Space

        * combine furniture with storage
* Water efficiency
* Electric efficiency
* Insulation efficiency

        * triple pane windows
        * vacuum insulated panels (VIP)
        * vacuum insulated glass windows
        * energy recovery ventilation
        * aerogel fabric
        * solatubes
        * solar domestic water heaters
        * 6"" exterior wall using two 2x2 with 2"" of rigid foam sandwiched between them
* Service runs efficiency (consolidate piping and wiring)
* Servicing efficiency (water, power, and sewer usage)

        * use natural light
        * grey-water system
* Task efficiency (to a point...not too high on my priorities)
* Acoustic efficiency (this one is actually pretty high on my priorities, I love music and recording, but don't necessarily want sound booth quality.
* Sightlines (tall shelves vs. deep low cabinets vs. hidden nooks vs. huge open space)

Forgetting expenses (tiny houses are much cheaper than regular anyway), what other things to optimize would you suggest, and how would you go about designing this thing?

EDIT: You know, another thing I Just though of was having to design for your own personal height. Being 6'6"" (200 cm) myself, I imagine I'll have a hard time with ceilings. As is usual. Gah.

Oh, also, I've already seen the Tall Man's Tiny House. It's pretty nifty. I'm just interested in optimizing things.

EDIT 2: updated my list. Still not quite sure how I want to prioritize things, though. Insulation definitely goes at the top of my list, followed by utility efficiency. I tried using google sketchup to fiddle with a small floorplan, but...I get stuck pretty fast. 

When you don't have any SPECIFICS to optimize, everything just feels really arbitrary. I just don't know how to get started.

**Edit 3: I'm really trying to boil this down to mathematics.** I know you can't practically approach everything mathematically, and you've got to be realistic and aesthetic too, but I want to come at it from an extreme angle and see where it takes me. I want to go crazy with the design at first and then reign it in. So. If anyone has any mathematical information, I'd welcome your input.

The bed took up most of the room space. As soon as you walk in the bed is to the right. Wall to the left. On the other side of the bed is a window with an air conditioner sticking out. Under the air conditioner is a building heater.
When I came into this room I quickly found I could get boxes that fit under the bed where I can place clothing. I also found there was some space to the side of the air conditioner and heater where I can place something.
At Walmart I bought something that looked like a clothes rack that fit in that space.
Now I was able to hang my nice clothing.
Under the rack I stored books and my laptop.

I did this optimization of space out of necessity, not because I was interested in living in a small space.
Although that seemed to work, it didn't look good.

One look inside, and there is one word that comes up:

**Crammed**

I wish there was some way to hide the clothes rack, it was already annoying to have to go on the bed each time I want to get some clothing, it was also an eye sore. The clothes rack I got from Walmart btw, was actually a laundry rack and wasn't intended for long term heavy clothing. The plastic bar started to bend down after a while.

Some of the places I have seen here look very nice.
I wanted to see if there is some kind of formula to follow for a place to look good and be livable. Perhaps a minimum space is required?

Since it was a sublet, I can't just knock down a wall for closet space, or do any of the other amazing things people have done here..",,False,self,t5_2rab5,1360541694.0,,,True,t3_189wur,http://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/189wur/dos_and_donts_for_tiny_dwellings/,

The costs these developers are asking is outrageous. An apartment building is much more efficient, green, cost effective and uses up less space in foot print and provides more open space. Look at the voids of space between these buildings. You look right at your neighbor while taking up valuable habitat space. The fact is you are being duped by marketing gimmicks, a fad, and dreams of owning your own home. I like tiny houses for low impact use in rural or suburban areas, but these trends of siting them in urban areas in groups is dumb. In these instances you should be looking to better designed multi family or common wall buildings and zoning/planning to preserve open spaces and natural habitat. **[If you want to address this in terms of typology, look no further than the efficient small row homes of 150 years ago.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/llewellynthefist/6462730877/in/set-72157628305629543/lightbox/)**",,False,self,t5_2rab5,False,,,True,t3_14u8de,http://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/14u8de/marketing_and_the_tiny_house_concept/,

One obvious solution is to have stairs that only lead to one room, and the second room is reach by passing through the first room. But this probably isn't satisfactory if the rooms are supposed to be bedrooms or otherwise private. 

The other obvious answer is to just have separate ladders that lead to each room, but as people on this sub, while ladders consume very little space, they're not great for young children, elderly people, pregnant women, disabled people, drunk people, or even just guests staying over who aren't used to them trying to use them in the middle of the night.

The only solution I can think of that uses stairs and keeps the rooms separate is to have stairs dividing the middle of the house, with a door on the left and right of the top stair to each room. But it seems inefficient to divide up the house like that.

Can anyone think of, or has anyone seen, any other solutions to this problem?


**Edit**: Realised a [pretty trivial solution](http://i.imgur.com/eZmS4KH.png). I forgot to label them, but the darker lines on the top and right of the stairs are doors.

For example, I have a mountain bike and a road bike that I use constantly. They're nice enough bikes where leaving them outside in the elements isn't really an option. I also enjoy sewing so currently I have a small desk dedicated to my sewing machine and current projects. In a tiny house I'd probably need to have a single desk that I use for many things, but that seems like a giant pain to have to clean up everything in the middle of a project and put it all away so I can do a little writing at the desk, then get all my sewing stuff out again afterwards. Additionally, I'm an engineer so I love to tinker with things and consequently have a whole slew of tools and materials. I've also been jonesing for an old aluminum canoe for years. I consider myself a minimalist-- I don't have a lot of things I don't use or a lot of extra clothes or dishes or decorations or whatever, but I have no idea how I could live in a tiny house and have room for my ""toys"".  How do you do it?

How much money will I really save by keep the kitchen close to the bathroom? One place I read said that I must keep them together to save on costs of plumbing. But the cost for a dozen extra feet of piping can't be that much. 

How does one connect to an external water source? What kind of fitting is needed? How does one dispose of grey water? of black water?

[The Ezekiel House Park Model](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjdIqm7tRg0) (not tiny house)
I don't like everything in this, but these guys do custom work so you can design whatever you want with them. [In this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiWNdoRzY0) he mentions the price being mid-upper 30s.  I see tiny houses in this price range quite often.  Here you get a whole lot more room so if you have your own land, I don't know why you wouldn't take a look at a park model (which is still mobile, if you really need that).

[The Uncle Bob](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHxw4WkyRAE)
A modular tiny house concept.  I really like that these guys are doing something different with tiny houses.  $6.5k for this base edition, additions around $3.5k.

[Badge # 802](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFOYYOW2qe0)
**I really like this one.**  I would make some changes but I think this one is pretty nice.

[The Cube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF_jlCyH8E0&amp;feature=player_embedded)
Not their original design, but I'm kind of liking it.  When I was watching this, I immediately thought of the modular concept like The Uncle Bob above.  This was before I even saw The Uncle Bob video.  Don't like everything, but again, they do totally custom work.  Price is $10k.

[The Annemarie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CimEUNruoBA)
The porch isn't for me (too much wasted space, IMO) but I could see a lot of people liking this.  $14.5k.

[JayJay's Studio](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h6iNc_Mdjg) - not quite a tiny house, but could be.  As seen, $12.5k.  With kitchen and bath $16.5k.

They have more videos I haven't even checked out yet.

What do you guys think?  Don't think I've ever seen them mentioned here.

These houses I keep seeing are in the 50k range, cheaper than the estimated cost of building some of Tumbleweed's larger homes.

A propane on demand shower

- I live in Austin, so the normal residential codes apply which means too small for a slab. At the same time, most neighborhoods ban trailer living

- I am considering buying land outside the incorporated city. This would increase my commute as well as add to the financial obligation, which is one of the reasons I want a tiny home

- I am pickier than most I think. I want running water. I want the option of electricity. I don't really want to rent someone's sideyard or backyard or similar situation

1370805368.0,33,self.TinyHouses,1fzuyw,Gable roof framing question,makeitquickoutlander,35,2,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/1fzuyw/gable_roof_framing_question/,"Hi Tiny House people! 

I've been doing a lot of research about tiny houses and have started to design my own tiny house (with google sketchup). I just started framing my roof, and it's left me a tad confused. I plan on building the tiny house (on a trailer roughly 8ft by 18ft) with a simple gabled roof, having the rafters attached to a ridge beam.

Now, I've looked at a ton of tiny house videos and pictures, and it seems to me that most tiny houses don't have ceiling joists/trusses/collar ties, so my question is what in the heck is supporting the walls against the outward force applied by the roof rafters?

I live in Canada and I'm sure my tiny roof would have to withstand some snow weight at some point. We also intend to insulate the roof, so we won't be able to gain head room by leaving the spaces between the rafters open (just exterior sheathing). 

I've thought about doing the standard ceiling joists attached to the rafters, but I think it will make our tiny loft too tiny. Most tiny houses appear to have the loft built shorter than the actual wall to allow for head room, which I would like to do. Ceiling joists would have to be placed on the top plate which means we would lose at least 4 inches of head room (a 2x4 and 0.5in flooring)

Collar ties won't work as I've read: 1) They can't be placed more than 1/3 the length of the rafter, on the rafter or they won't be effective compressors. 2) If I did install them properly they would interfere with sleeping in the loft space.

Trusses won't work because they would also interfere with the loft space, and also I don't want to have to make or install them.

I have considered using some sort of laminated beam as one would in a cathedral ceiling installation, but I have some concerns, mainly: It would be difficult installing a heavy beam with only a handful of workers (all volunteers). Since the rafters would cross over the beam with a bird's mouth joint we would still be losing head space in the loft as we would have to lower the roof height (so it's still road-worthy).

So, why don't any of these tiny houses seem to have anything supporting the exterior walls from the outward pressure of the rafters? Is it unnecessary for such a small span? I think I read somewhere that trusses at least, weren't required for an 8ft span, but it's important for me to have a solid understanding before I continue planning. How can I support my tiny house from the outward force of the rafters without sacrificing loft space?

Thanks in advance!

TL;DR: What is supporting the exterior walls from the outward force of the rafters in a tiny house? What can I do to support my walls without sacrificing loft space?

I'm known for build things and its well in my ability, but what tips do you have for keeping cost down and being minimal which whats used? I want to build a cool house that I can use to build more better stuff and a tiny house is perfect!

Would it be much better to find something to build your house in? Right now I'm thinking a silo or something like that that wouldnt cost much to get an old one.

Can you just outright build a house out of mud or something similar?

I will find a way but i know some people here will have useful info for me. I don't need a lot of space at all its just so I can live on my own (with my girlfriend) and I do what I want, which is mainly building things so I can get somewhere in life. At home we are close to town and don't have the space I need. One thing I might build is a boat I can live on but I would need my own place to be able to build it!

Whats a good cheap and minimal general design? Like an A frame or something? One thing I was planning to do is have a geodesic dome, bedroom on top of whatever I built, maybe I could make a really simple and small trapeze shape with a dome on top. Domes are super easy to make! I could just have a dome house but I would feel unsatisfied and it would be hard to make good use of all the space I think.

The main problem is finding a place to build. I could probably be small enough to get past building consent from experience and I would hope Its somewhere people wouldn't know/ care there is a small house there. I thought maybe I could ask people or people I know that have a lot of land they don't use all of if I could build there and in return do some work for them and make them stuff. I have a friend my age that is very lucky and has her own land I might be able to build her her own house on too.

Love Victorian style houses, but a Victorian style tiny house?  Awesome!

Friend of mine lives 1/2 of the week in a ""gartenhaus"" - basically a garden house.  Normally people don't live in them full time, they spend weekends in them or just hang out in the evenings.  Some of them are pretty elaborate, some are sheds that are falling down, typically you see a lot of them at baumarkts (think home depot/lowes) that are hexagonal with seats around a grill so you can eat in them or turn them into a sauna.

But - the company that makes these makes 2 sizes, 1 that is about 160sqft, 1 that is about 250sqft, I think throw a loft up top and a composting toilet in one corner and you'd be good to go...",,False,self,t5_2rab5,False,,,True,t3_ncshn,http://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/ncshn/i_have_found_my_tiny_house_to_be/,

I was thinking about it and I wonder how feasible it is to mass produce cube frames with insets on the sides for customizable wall pieces.  For instance, someone could go online, order a few cubes and then order specific pre-built walls like walls with doors, windows, a wall that is all window, custom floors, ceilings, etc.  When you get it, you simply slide the walls, floors, and ceilings into place and you have a home like building with legos.  Or leave one half of a cube open and connect two, three, four, hundred frames together to create a larger house.  Already been done?

It occurs to me that there are five (maybe more) ways to place a Tiny House legally:

1. Land zoned without building restrictions. I know of land in the mountains of Oregon (Deschutes County) that is suitable for Tiny House placement (subject to city or community restrictions). Areas in remote locations may not have the attractive demographics that Tiny House residents want, however.

2. Land zoned for campgrounds (but not necessarily RV's).

3. Land zoned for RV's (which may include campground use).

4. Land zoned for mobile homes, manufactured homes, or a trailer park.

5. Residential land (rural or city) that allows for year-round occupation of a parked RV (aka Tiny House.) 

The ""best case scenario"" I can envision, is to find undeveloped or under-developed land zoned for RV's, campgrounds, or a trailer park and 'partner' with the owner to develop the land *exclusively* as  Tiny House Community. In my limited research (so far) I am finding that many people *want* to live in a community of other Tiny House people, possibly sharing resources like a community/rec center (that may include laundry facilities) within walking distance to a small general store, nature trails, and hopefully public transportation to a reasonably sized city. 

Questions:

1. Has anybody compiled a ""list"" of communities/cities that allow the year-round occupation of a Tiny House on single family residential lots?

2. Does anybody know anyone with land zoned for campground, RV, Trailer Park, or a Mobil Home Park that is not being utilized --OR-- does anyone have any suggestions about how to *find* such a person owning such land? (*A Realtor was my first thought on this, but I don't have the big bucks needed to buy such a location and the only way I can see a start-up finding success is to partner with a land owner. My assumption is that if someone has that kind of property for sale, then  more than likely they need the money and want to sell, not partner with a start-up. Also, I don't believe that a real estate agent will work to help find this kind of a deal since there wouldn't really be any commission involved...) 

3. Does anybody want to *work with me* in developing a business of creating Tiny House Communities? I *DO* believe there is a major market to be explored on the tiny house front (especially, I imagine, in student housing near campus where dorm rent *could go* towards home ownership instead...) and I can see incredible success to the first company that can ""put it all together"".

What do you say Reddit? Is ""Tiny"" the next ""Big"" thing?

Anyway:

1) If I were to get one of those tiny homes that you can hitch on to a truck, how exactly does plumbing/electricity/internet work with that? I always imagined that I'd have to have wires running in my house from some close area.

2) What's a good resource as far as creating and understanding a checklist of to-dos as far as knowing what you'd need in addition to your house, like building codes, land, and laws of the sort. I'm only 20, I don't know much about how the world works yet, so I'm pretty naive as far as what I need to do to make something like this a reality.

3) how practical is it to have a small mobile house? Is it hard or expensive to move to scenic spots for vacation. Do you find that there's a lot of trouble that goes into living comfortably, and then hitching up and going, then settling back into comfortably living? For instance, fastening down, or strapping loose items in your house so they don't bounce, fall, or damage anything else; setting up pipes/wires/etc; or even finding it hard to take the home on certain roads or highways due to size/weight/etc.?

Thanks guys! I like the idea of having a small house and the idea of taking it to a nearby beach every now and then to vacation (I live in Fl, so the beaches are all pretty close), or even traveling and living in different states, depending on my job.

People say you don't need money for love but you do.  Forget the wedding and the ring and the cake and all that bullshit.  We just want to have a place that's our own, even if it's tiny, where we can have a baby and not have to worry constantly about bills.

We've decided to build a house.  Something modest and something cost effective and here are our weighings:

1. Earthbag house: We've gotten the costs for this venture down to $16k including plumbing and zoning.  However, it would take us about a year to build granted we have great weather and everything goes as planned.  That requires at least one of us taking a whole year off working.  Impossible.  We could space that out, but...

2. Tiny House: I really like some of the designs.  They're a little more expensive for not a whole lot of space BUT they appear to be pretty high quality and we could build it in a few weeks if we jammed.  If we invested $20k we would have a permanent and mobile home to possibly expand on.  If we got a plot of land we could also put a trailer on it or a shipping container and convert that and we could even possibly build the earthbag house later on and then use the tiny house as a guest house.

3. Get a trailer or shipping container for free and refurbish it.  We've looked on craigslist and have found a lot of people getting rid of their old, broke down, trailers.  They can't afford to move them and are willing to give them away for free.  They are almost always shitty but if they don't have mold or a ton of rust it could be easier than converting a shipping container.  We would also be able to move in immediately and work on it from the inside.

What do you think of these ideas?  Do you think it's possible to live in a tiny house with a child?  Do you think it's worth $20k to have a tiny house because it's quality and mobile?  Or should we focus on the trailer or earthbag house idea?",,False,self,t5_2rab5,False,,,True,t3_wjcgx,http://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/wjcgx/to_tiny_house_or_not_to_tiny_house/,

I'm looking at the [Lusby](http://www.tumbleweedhouses.com/products/lusby/). We would park it in one of the many trailer parks in our area an only end up paying $100 a month or so in rent. Which sounds so amazing.

I've seen many posts and articles about tiny houses. What seems to be a common factor is a missing bathroom. Can it really be called a house these days if you cant shower or even use the toilet in it? All I want is a good floor plan but with base instructions for water line ideas.

I mean you see 2 classes, those on wheels, those on ground. I keep seeing the same thing, each look roomy from the inside but no bathroom to speak of. The wheels I can understand because of the tanks needed but the ones on the ground you could connect to the water/waste lines of the main house or septic system.

Side Note 1: I dont see them utilizing solar panels as much as they should.

Side Note 2: A tiny basement would be fun too with a floor trap door with a ladder down to the basement with a washer/dryer down there adding to the space to work with and functionality. Because of the small size and little weight on it it can be sealed so it does not require a sump pump and other things you would find needed in larger basements.

I'm a enthusiast interested in potentially building/moving into a Tiny House now that I'm out of college. I am hoping to avoid the long-term commitment and debt associated with purchasing a full-sized home, and want the flexibility that comes with a portable home. However, my brother is exceptionally tall with long limbs and consequently opposed to the concept because he feels he'd be uncomfortable spending time in a residence so small. So, folks that have lived in tiny houses, are the ceilings tall enough to accommodate a 6-7 person? And is there space to stretch limbs while, say, sitting on the couch or at the table? I'd love to move forward with this idea but it would be inconsiderate to reside in a home that my brother is uncomfortable spending time at.

1364672377.0,22,self.TinyHouses,1bbfgv,Building a Mobile Chicken Coop on a Bicycle Trailer: Living full-time on a rolling homestead!,negroyverde,30,8,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/1bbfgv/building_a_mobile_chicken_coop_on_a_bicycle/,"Hey y'all, I'm working on a new project: a totally mobile, bicycle-powered liveaboard trailer homestead. I'm aiming to produce a hefty 50% of my diet at low cost with a moving micro-farm that produces eggs, insects for meat, microgreens, sprouted grains, and mushrooms (with plans in the works to incorporate rabbits as I'm able to enlarge the capacity of the trailer and economize space). In addition to that, I can be foraging wild edibles, hunting squirrel, eating roadkill, and reclaiming waste food when available.

My trailer will be lightweight, designed from wood, coroplast, and canvas, built atop two reclaimed wheelchair frames and wheels. The trailer will have four wheels - the front two on a bearing like a radio flyer wagon. Between the two axles there will be - hopefully - the chicken coop. Atop that will be a 5' x 8' platform that will be home to a covered-wagon-esque canvas hoop house which will be my living quarters and sleeping area. I am very experienced in living in small spaces - I have dwelled in wall tents for a substantial amount of time and own few possessions.

Here is a diagram: http://postimg.org/image/isy8ottrt/full/ and  http://postimg.org/image/42e7wagwt/
My hope is to have four or five bantam hens. I have considered several designs: one being to keep the chickens in a coop under my sleeping area and carrying portable fencing, setting it up as I break camp. This seems the most feasible of options. Other ideas have included wire-floor arks, basically lobster pots which could be fastened to the undercarriage of the trailer when in motion, but set in the grass throughout the daytime so the chickens can feed.

I think there are some big advantages to running a system like this. Notably, it allows me to go wherever I please without the concerns posed by gasoline-powered transportation. It gives me a guaranteed source of food, so long as I am able to keep the colonies of insects living well, the flock of chickens reproducing, and have a solid system of caches of grains for sprouting and greening. It costs very little to design this. I'm going to end up spending about $200 total. No land costs - set up wherever is safest, wherever there's permission. So long as I'm kept well stocked with bike parts and inner tubes, I'm rolling.

I'm actually going to spend a year or so living in the trailer full-time. It's an experimental endeavor to figure out just how much food can be produced with very little money, space, or resources, as well as an experiment in just how small of a space a human can live in without going crazy.

Security and water are my two biggest concerns. I'm designing a charcoal sleeve filter for water, a holding tank that collects runoff from the roof of the sleeping area, and will be keeping a cache of iodine. I'm also building a tiny solar gravity shower that collects the greywater and stores it for the chickens. Security-wise, I'm going to have to use the advantages afforded by my mobility to put myself in positions where I'd be safest. My tires will be capable of handling some offroad trails - and I'll be sticking around in the boondocks anyway, of course. I'm also working out what arms I'm going to carry. Likely a bow/crossbow and a small-caliber black powder rifle. Last, in bad weather, I'm building in hooks on the sides of the unit to tie it down, and have a long-term goal of building a silnylon rainfly to cover the whole thing.

Is this impossible? If not, what criticisms would you offer? I think weight will be the greatest concern, but keep in mind that each wheelchair is designed to hold upwards of 300 lbs. Let me know what you all think.

At the moment, we currently own a fairly standard-sized home in a small town. We also have a 2-year-old son. I'm curious to hear about other people who have tiny homes and children. Do you live full time in the homes? Are they more a weekend getaway?

If we didn't have a kid, I'd probably want to sell our house and move to the tiny home full time. But I just don't think I can impose that level of separation from society on him. The lots we're looking at are all in the country (maybe 45 minutes from where we live) and there really wouldn't be any neighbors to speak of. I certainly am not trying to sound elitist and I know it's possible to raise perfectly rounded and happy children in very sparsely populated areas but I just don't think I want to raise my kid that way. I want him to be able to play in the neighborhood, go over to friends' houses after school, walk to the ice cream parlor, etc.

So currently we're planning our tiny home as more of a weekend place (and a place to freely loan out to friends who need some peace and quiet). I can imagine it being a really special place for the kid to spend a lot of time in growing up--spend a few weeks out in nature over the summers, go skiing in the winters, etc. Maybe in 20 years when the kid moves out my wife and I would move in full time but for now, I think we'd be a two-home family. I can't deny that there's a twinge in me that feels like that defeats the purpose of a tiny home. Just curious to hear how others have handled it.

I know the owner, and the land isn't being used for anything so he would be willing to sell it. What I'd like to know first is:    
* What sort of issues should I expect as far as soil quality goes, living in the woods near a creek?    
* What sort of water-recycling options would be available to me? I've seen a video about earthship homes in NM (?) that covered this pretty well but I can't find it now. Maybe someone here knows where to find it?  
* Should I expect any hassle from state/county government regarding my desire to put in a composting toilet?    
* I'd like to build a yurt (30' probably) on the land to start off with. Should I expect to run into trouble from the county, due to the fact that it would be a semi-permanent structure, or would making it permanent ease their worries?

I mean, really actually **living** in a Tiny House year round.  The biggest problem I see is not the utilities or space (*I've lived in a college dorm, no worries there*).  The biggest problem is your local building codes.

For HUD approval, the building must be much bigger; about 45 ft long.  That isn't a Tiny House--that is a regular modular home.  So how can a Tiny House be approved for private lot habitation?

One crazy idea I just had is to build a simple, ""cheap"" hangar enclosure to surround one or more Tiny Houses inside.  An example of a hanger might look something like [this](http://www.loopnet.com/Attachments/7/A/3/7A309E99-8074-452D-9565-C1315192F717.jpg), only with windows on all sides.

The idea is to have a large outer shell, with a permanent concrete foundation.  There would be a large door on one end so that Tiny Houses and be rolled in and out at will.  There would also be plenty of windows on the hanger, perhaps even ones that can slide open so that a Tiny House can be put into a corner and not have the views blocked so much.

My feeling is that your building inspector would never approve it, but who knows maybe it can be tweaked to allow it.  Obviously it would look bizarre.  And I think your neighbors would really hate you because the whole setup would be an eyesore.

I know that 120 sq ft is generally accepted as an ""under the radar"" number to avoid the burden of permits and whatnot, and that trailers are also a big part of it. What I'm wondering is... how strictly are such things enforced? I get annoyed when I find a cute house that's 130 or 160 square feet because it seems like an automatic ""nope"" if I'm planning on building myself. Is that true (both practically and technically/legally speaking)? Who's going to stop me (or notice) if my house ends up being 128 or 140 square feet and not 120? Is it also something to do with road regulations? And while we're on the subject, I know nothing about those. 

Also: As far as permits and restrictions go, how much has to do with building vs. living? Basically, if I manage to get my home built without a problem, am I then in the clear, or (depending on where I park it) will I also have to worry about being cited for living in it?

I've been following the tiny house movement closely since I discovered it about a year ago.  I had always been interested in shipping container homes, but after doing some reading I discovered they aren't all what they've cracked up to be (namely insulation and structural issues).  The environmentalism of small homes was a huge appeal to me.  When I found the ""tumbleweed style,"" and natural wood, and the coziness, I was sold.

Being out in the real world, my reasoning has changed.  Apartment hunting has been tough because you can either get a crap place for cheap or a nice place that is expensive, but ultimately they are about the same size, when I would gladly pay for a smaller place that was well done.  I have lived on ships and boats so limited space doesn't bother me, but quality and comfort is what I was looking for.

Then being in the real world I came up against the issues of cost: tiny home owners being debt free, debt free meaning freedom.

Mobility has also become something I see the value in more and more every day.  After my girlfriend's home was threatened by some major disasters, plus the general increased occurrence of some horrific weather events being able to move your home and all your belongings (save your land) seems pretty appealing.

That mobility also brings freedom.  Want to live somewhere new?  It's relatively easy to pick up and go.

My complaint with them would be the sacrifices I have seen many such homes make, but the owners end up having to compensate in some way (bumming off of friends, for instance) so I want to eventually make a tiny home with full (or nearly full) amenities.  I did just that and put together a little design that I wanted to share and see what everyone thought. 

The entire thing is intended to fit on a utility trainer and have a 20 foot by 8 foot footprint.  One wall (with windows and skylights in the roof) is intended to face north, while the other (bookshelves floor to ceiling and solar panels on the roof) is intended to face south.

It's a wet bathroom, 3 feet by 7 feet, fold down bench in shower, fold down counter space behind door, possible graywater toilet.  Shower head attached to overhead rafter; fan unit for removing odors and moisture in air.

Laundry room and wardrobe (4 feet by 7 feet) with stacked compact washer drier, high shelves, hanger rack against opposite wall (and high to be out of the way).  Why have a hamper?  Throw your dirty clothes right into the machine before you go into the adjacent room to take a shower!  And then come right back out, get an outfit off the shelf and get dressed.

Both rooms' windows are 2ft wide by 1ft high at 5ft to 6ft above the level of the floor (for privacy from outside, but a bit of view and light inside).

The main room I drew out, but basic idea is full hight fridge, two burner stove top with open cabinets underneath.  Over it is a combination range hood, microwave, and convection oven (for space saving).  A thin sink next to it.  Lots of shelf space over the kitchen and wrapping around to a set of high full wall bookshelves with a library ladder that also aids accessing the sleeping loft.  I am debating a built in desk next to the shelves, or possibly a folding design.  I'd also plan on a futon as a couch/guest sleeping and a kitchen island on wheels with storage underneath and leaves to become a dinner table.

So, what am I missing?  It will be at least 2 years before I might even be able to do this, but I'm planning ahead none the less...",,False,self,t5_2rab5,False,,,True,t3_igoqb,http://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/igoqb/designed_a_tiny_house_curious_what_you_all_think/,

It is a dwelling designed to be to provide exactly the right amount of space for the occupants. Tiny Houses are places meant to house people and not stuff.

Next month, I'm going to move into my first tiny house. I'm really excited about it, but I'm also a little nervous. It is mostly furnished, so I don't need any advice about furniture, but more just...logistics, I guess.

So, those of you who do or have lived in tiny spaces, what are some things you wish you'd know when you moved in? How do you arrange your belongings so you don't go crazy? Are there any products you can't live without or that make your living situation much easier?

Also, I'm worried about food storage. I have a very small and skinny cart to keep food on. Any tips on keeping a small amount of food in the house, or planning menus to use things well? I won't have an oven, but I will have two burners, a toaster oven, a crockpot, and a rice cooker.

With that out of the way I want to create sort of an RV, but on a large tricycle. My idea is to take an old bike I have and remove the back wheel and weld in a trike addition onto the back, something strong enough to hold a few hundred pounds. Make the back slightly larger then a twin size bed, and build a case around that, 3-4 feet tall (tall enough to sit in). Put some windows on that, add some storage and what not. I'd have a battery that would be charged by an alternator running off of a second chain on the bike wheel, this would allow me to have some light and charging for any small electronics at night.

Now this is not a home to live in obviously, but I was inspired by a guy who biked around Europe with nothing but a tent on his back. I want to be able to make small bike trips (well trike) and camp out at some areas. So my questions are will I be able to pedal something like this, if not would I need to add a small electric motor (and also how hard would this be to add on). What regulations would I have to follow with this, or can I just build it and go for it. ect.

(skip over this part if you wish, it's not that important) Lastly just so you know, I am an 18 year old who is struggling with college, so I want to be able to do trips like this without wasting much money, which I was I'm avoiding any gas powered device. I'd like it to be a simple design, and preferably one that won't destroy my wallet.

Thanks to ellipsisoverload I found [this gem](http://www.guelo46.de/00005.html), It's almost exactly what I want, but a square top and a more pointed front (like the front plow on a train).


To clarify this trike would not be used for really big touring our anything. It will only be used to travel out like 20 to 40 miles and camp somewhere.

A little ranty...,z3m,22,6,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/196ckm/is_living_in_a_rv_with_a_baby_really_that_crazy_a/,"My SO and I are both gainfully employed and he makes decent money - I make okay money.  We're a couple hundred dollars over the poverty line, definitely blue collar but breaching the lower end of middle class against all odds in a depression.

I have no illusions that we are never going to be wealthy and I'm fine with this.  But, I would like to eventually own my own house and the way it's looking I'm never going to have $30,000 just lying around for a house.  We don't even know how we're going to get through this pregnancy financially!

I've realized that if we're going to make this work we're going to have to take some extreme measures.  I have a pretty cheap one bedroom basement apartment that I pay $600 a month for and I was thinking, a large RV would cost me about a years worth of rent.  If I lived in it for 2 years it would MORE than pay for itself and it might afford me the ability to save for a piece of land to build on.

However everyone I tell this idea to says ""NO WAY!  You CAN'T live in an rv with your SO and baby!""  Peoples reactions are really extreme.  They seem to think that if we move into an rv we're suddenly going to start smoking meth and acting all Jerry Springer.  Somehow living in a tiny one bedroom apartment is considered WAY better than living in a large RV.

The way people react makes me think ""Is this actually a bad idea?""  I mean, I've seen a lot of videos online about people making it work and even liking it!  And for all intents and purposes these people seem as normal as I.  So, I wonder are they right?  Will I get into that RV and suddenly go ""O shit.  I'm living in an RV with a baby!  What am I thinking?!""  Or am I going to be like ""This is great!  I'm saving so much rent by the time she's old enough to really get into stuff I might actually have a piece of land!""

Or is it just so overwhelmingly trashy for someone to live in an RV with their baby that the stigma will drive me too nuts?  Or will people see it's not so bad and get over it?

TLDR?:  I think I just want someone to try to convince me one way or the other.  Is this is great idea or a terrible idea?  I think it would be a great way to save money to build a real house but everyone else seems to think it's bad, but may be I'm just talking to the wrong people.",,False,self,t5_2rab5,False,,,True,t3_196ckm,http://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/196ckm/is_living_in_a_rv_with_a_baby_really_that_crazy_a/,

However. We were hoping to start trying for kids in the next two years, and we were hoping to try and have two kids close together, so I would be pregnant with a baby. It occured to me today that that might get legally sticky in a really bad way.

My sister, a while back, sold her house and stayed with a family friend for a few months. During that time, she was considered legally homeless, and the insurance she gets through the state took that into consideration. Since our tiny house would be on wheels and we don't own any land, we would be similarly legally homeless. Disregarding for the moment the space issue with having kids in a tiny house, I was wondering if anyone had any insight into the legal problems with being considered homeless and having a child. Homeless children can be considered neglected by the state and taken away, and what with the compost toilet/conditional electricity/food preparation aspects of living in a tiny house, the house could be considered insufficient living conditions.

I believe that I can make &amp; collect funds for this in about 3 months at this range, but I'd still like to improve the project in the 3-6 months following until I'm fully satisfied with it. What are my options for materials in bulk? I'd like to ideally buy online. I'm not particularly interested in wood, as I'd prefer something a little bit more modern and consistently manufactured. If there is a kit available that falls in this range, that'd be great. I don't quite trust the prices of kits, but if there's a good enough deal on one I'd choose that route. 


* I'd prefer to use a floor plan, but I'm also considering making something custom that is inspired by multiple floor plans. Is there anything other than basic blueprints available somewhere? Is all of the information for efficient housing scattered or is there somewhere with a lot of high-quality images that I can scan and understand? 


* I want a small but function bathroom with a toilet, shower and small mirror + sink + countertop space + storage (for toilet paper, drain cleaner, extra soap etc). Are there any retailers that have modern versions of these that would fit into a small space? I have an idea for a semi-circle idea for the bathroom that should be pretty nice. 


* Is there any site/company with a lot of dual-use+ furniture? Transforming couches are awesome. Furniture is what's mostly likely to be added after the project is complete. 


* I will mostly be using this for writing and as a small music studio. As such, I need to soundproofed. What are the options here? I've already soundproofed with foam, but I'm not sure if I should build the walls with layers of flammable foam to soundproof it if there's an alternative. I'd prefer to be able to turn my amp up and hit the zone at 3 A.M. without having to worry about waking everyone within a few hundred feet.

I know I want something mobile, so I'm veering away from a trailer unless I could get a good deal on a truck to hitch it to.  So, I'm mostly looking at large RVs.

My questions about the bathrooms are:

1. I understand the concept of a ""grey water tank"".  This is water that you don't drink but could use for a quick shower.  So is there a ""black water tank"" for the toilet""?

2. Are most RV toilets flush toilets?  If so I assume they flush into some kind of tank.  What is exactly the protocol for cleaning these out?

3. Obviously you have to clean them out every few days.  Where does one go to do this?  I imagine having an RV I might pull it into some park for a night, pump out the septic tank.  Is this how it works or is there some other place to do this?

I love the idea of the tiny house, I really do. I'm a residential designer and have spent far too much time propagating suburbia for a living, so knowing people are out their fighting the wrong I have created is reassuring! The sad truth is for every tiny house that someone changes their lifestyle accommodate, there are likely hundreds of 4000sqft mcmansion that go up. 

I'm sorta working some side projects pitching the idea of small houses for the masses, but I've been struggling with determining the ideal size! I know there is no one size fits all answer, but while the &lt;500sqft tiny house is a lifestyle for some, I'm doubtful the majority of families or couples are willing to make that transition. So what size is the magic compromise in size that is small enough to make a difference environmentally yet without sacrificing the lifestyle that most people have become accustomed too? I think the magic number is somewhere between 1000-1500sqft for the ideal house. Just looking for some feedback on that. Does the tiny house community think that's wasteful opulence, while still being seen as miniscule by the mcmansion crowd, and effectively creating a house with no market? Thoughts?

**Edit:**
Thanks for all the input! It sounds like the size range I'm proposing is about right, so for a start I'll aim more or less the middle at 1200sqft and see how nice of a place I can come up with. Doing this in my free time so might be awhile before there's anything to show for it, but I'll post my results for sure when there's something worthwhile!

[Update]

I've found there are a few ""park model RV"" log cabin makers around here, which might do the trick.  
[Country Park Home &amp; Cabin](http://www.parkhomesandcabins.com/logcabins.htm)  
[Mountain Recreation Log Cabins](http://www.mountainrecreationlogcabins.com/)  
[Home Traditions NC](http://www.hometraditionsnc.com/)

And one ""log"" cabin maker:  
[Happy Hideaway](http://www.happyhideawaync.com/cabins.html)

[Update 2]

When I emailed Home Traditions, all the reply basically said was ""read the website"" (never mind the fact that the website doesn't answer the questions I asked).  But they did reply in just a few hours and on a Sunday.  So a mixed experience with them so far.

Upon closer inspection, I see that Country Park and Mountain Recreation are selling the same cabins, and Home Traditions also has a similar style.  I'm not sure which, if any, is the manufacturer and which is a reseller.  I'll try to find out.

This is a ""tiny house"" i stayed in for about a week for work. It's at a wildlife sanctuary park, so it's partially ""off grid"" - solar, rain water etc. I suppose i'll explain the house, what i liked (and didn't like) about it, how it could be improved for permanent living.

[**Sketchy paint floor plan**](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#13)

**Quick tour:**

[First photo](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#0) is looking at it from outside. Full undercover parking. What was clever about this design was that the balcony was raised so that you could easily unload the back of the ute. Might not be great for small vehicles, but i did like not having to reaching up into the tray. I could also grab stuff from the ute in my socks, without getting wet/dirty. 

[Main Deck](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#1) is probably the highlight of the house. It overlooked a gorge which was fantastic. It was an open veranda with no railings, and a small drop to grass. A good feature was the light that hung over the table that could be switched on from outside the house. It also meant when you came home, you had a good place to take off wet boots etc, and not get mud all through the house. But at the same time, you weren't leaving your boots exposed to the elements. It's a shame it is winter here in Australia, otherwise this would have been used more often.

[Entrance](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#2) - simple door, and flyscreen.

[Main living room](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#3) with [fireplace](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#4) which was a godsend when coming home cold and wet. Little hanging rack for large kitchen implements, as well as a larger rack for pots and pans (out of the way).

[Master bedroom](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#7) Large queen bed, *just* enough gap around the edge.

Worlds largest [shower](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#9) for the smallest house. Shower floor was steel and had raised edges 1 ft high to keep the water in. [Toilet](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#10) was for emergencies (there was a toilet outside for regular use)

**Problems/How i would improve the house**

First and foremost, i think it's worth designing the house around the temperature of where it's placed. This house would have been fantastic in summer (considering the veranda is half the house's footprint). However, because it was winter and it was freezing, the balcony was hardly used. I think that's worth taking into consideration depending on the climate. If there was an issue with flies, i'd consider screening off the entire deck, that would make it much better at night.

- More hooks - for coats etc. It would have been great to have hooks around the place for jackets. If not on [wall next to the door on the outside](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#2), but behind the door. Possibly behind all doors.
- More storage - no storage of any kind, no bedside table (even folding down would be nice). I would make the shower a foot (or 2) smaller, and have some deep storage behind the door. 
- Toilet was an emergency toilet, the proper toilet was a communal one behind the house
- A place inside to sit and relax, probably remove the bunks and replace with a folding bed or something. There really wasn't a place where you could sit down, lay back and relax (inside). particularly if you didn't want to lie in bed. 
- Bar stools were kind of useless, nobody wants to sit and face a wall to eat. I'd probably install bench seats on one side, and/or have a [drop down table](http://weblog.redisdead.net/images/table.jpg) from the wall, 
- Outside clothes line, for towel drying at least. The area of balcony behind the vehicle would have been perfect for a fold down line. The house might even help creating a mini wind tunnel through there
- This place only had one powerpoint (for the fridge), so obviously more power points etc.
- The [kitchen hooks need to be in a better place](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#12). When you lift the stove lid, you'd have to remove the spatular etc. 
- Thicker doors (especially on the toilet) - a rickety old bi-fold door wasn't great at keeping smell/moisture etc in the bathroom.
- Air exhausts in the kitchen was required. You really need and exhaust (or the window) moved over where the stove is.
- Round sinks don't really interest me, but whatever floats your boat.

**What features did you really like about the house?**

- hardwood floors only - easier to clean etc
- Large undercover veranda - take off boots etc
- I like the idea of the corrugated iron walls (upto 1m high). Might make them out of a different material though (cold to touch in winter)

**Would i live in the house?**

Yes, with storage and electricity fixed up, i think it would be a great house for a couple.

To augment the heat absorbed by the cement, would it be practical to use a closed under-floor radiant heating system where the water is heated by copper coils around my wood stove?

[Another angle](http://i.imgur.com/uua6k)  
[Boarded up to prevent bear invasions](http://i.imgur.com/WVWge)  

I slightly modified [these plans](http://www.tinyhousedesign.com/2011/09/05/8x12-tiny-house-free-plans/) and built it in a couple of weeks with two friends.  I had zero carpentry experience and they had very little.

It's in the middle of the mountains in Alaska, so I'm not worried about building codes, etc.

Modifications of plans:  
I skipped the siding and paint.  I added a 8x6 loft inside.  I bought used windows that were sized differently than the plans call for, so had to adjust for that.  Due to heavy snow loads, I used 2x6 for studs and 2x8 for roof rafters and floor joists.  I insulated the floor and will add wall insulation if I ever decide to spend some winter time there.  I built the door from plywood.

I just have a small Coleman camping stove now, but might add something more permanent eventually.  There are no services, so my gas comes from a propane can, water is hauled unless I pay a well-digger to come out, electricity would require a noisy generator.

Happy to answer any questions.

EDIT: The dimensional lumber was milled locally by a homesteader in the area.  I bought everything else at Home Depot and fit into one pickup truck load, no trailer.

My partner &amp; I currently live in a 2 bed unit roughly double the size I'd like.   I like the idea of a home being a living space without the emphasis on entertaining space and having dedicated space for guests that only gets used 3 days per year.

I also LOVE the idea of smart, functional furniture, like Murphy beds and tables like the one linked recently that folds back to the wall to be an art piece.

I created a home design on the iPhone app linked a few days ago and would like some critique on it, if you're willing. At 37sqm (400 sq ft) it isn't tiny, but its size is a compromise with a partner who thinks our current home ""is fine how it is"".

As you can see, the larger wall is all cupboards. Inside the cupboards are the kitchen, a Murphy bed and a small office in between. The kitchen (table-end) would have pull-out surfaces for cooking use, plus a cooker (or at the least a camping stove), a canopy for exhaust removal, a microwave and bar fridge. The bathroom is pretty straightforward, except I'd build a cupboard for the washer (or just use a laundromat).
