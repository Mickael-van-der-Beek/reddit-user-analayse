I looked over the side to investigate and saw a couple of guys accosting a woman and trying to steal her bag.

From the bridge (there were stairs down to where they were just next to me) I bellowed at the top of my lungs and as powerfully as possible for them to stop, leave her the fuck alone, what the fuck are you doing, if I have to come down there I'll fuck you up, etc etc, they let her go, she bolted for the stairs towards me and they just walked off, their attack failed.

The woman was fine, understandably a bit shaken, so I walked her home where we reported the incident to the police.

They had apparently pulled a knife (I didn't see it, she didn't see it, they just held something metallic against her neck), so I'm very happy there was no physical confrontation, just disturbing them, letting them know it was no longer a secret event, was enough.

The best self defence is awareness! Don't walk around with earphones in in dark secluded areas!

As an aside I was coming home from my kali training and had a pair of rattan clearly visable in my backpack, this may have added to the effect, though I can't be certain. The situation was finished before it occurred to me to use them, but I certainly would have if required, though I don't like the idea of an actual fight with a couple of guys one armed with a knife, even with a pair of stout sticks. Basically I think I looked like more trouble than I was worth. 

Talking to the woman, the attack didn't seem well planned and was likely just opportunistic.

You don't really have much time to react, before you know what's happening it's just a flurry of fists. And the winner is usually the one that lands the lucky shot. It's never like the movies


 - Those of you in /r/martialarts that have actually been in a real street fight, could you tell us what it was like


For me, the one that sticks out in my mind was when I went into town and I happened across a dude I met the night before that I had somehow ticked off. He was with 3 of his friends and I was by myself, and there happened to be no other people around at that time. Well he recognized me and immediately started cursing and yelling and walking up on me, I tried to talk him down and avoid a confrontation but he wouldn't have it. I was really nervous due to that he had a bit of a possy with him and I kept having images of being boot f**ked, but they were hanging back a bit so I assumed that only this dude wanted me. 

I knew that if he got me down I'd be royally screwed, so I had to put him down, and hard enough so that the others wont get involved. So I slowly slid my right foot back and braced. He came in double hand shoved me to my chest cursing me up and down again (waited till he initiated so I could claim self defense), and that's when he ran in swinging a wild right handed hay maker (which for the record is the dumbest move ever). I stepped in with my right foot and caught his arm and executed Osoto Gari (for those who don't know, it's a Judo technique http://youtu.be/gus3kezcBcM). Except I did my own version, I slammed my right heel against his and palmed the heel of my right hand into his nose as hard as I could. 

He hit the ground, and he hit it hard, and I stepped back and looked up at his boys and they were just standing there like statues. so I turned and walked off (quickly) and haven't seen him since. And that all happened in about 5 or 6 seconds of him seeing me. I was shaking for a few hours, had to sit in my car and try to calm down for quite awhile. I was lucky, it could have gone bad easily, I gambled that the others wouldn't get involved, and I gambled with what I did. What if he pulled a knife? Man was I stupid...but still, it's always a gamble.

I could have so easily misjudged his punch and I could have been the one laying there. All this was racing through my head, and what if someone saw it and I wound up on YouTube, or what if someone called the cops and now they are looking for me.... it's not worth it. I could have run, and he ""might"" have chased me, I could have just backed off and played the b*tch, I could have done many things but I did this. I don't know how bad his injuries are, what if I killed him? (unlikely, but still I have no idea), what if....

What's funny though, is that it's ALWAYS after the fact when you realize that you could have said an awesome phrase, like in Die Hard or something, but that's probably for the best because that could just have made him want to come after me again or something. It's bad enough that I have to watch my back now, you never know if the dude you scrap with holds grudges or not. There is ALWAYS a price of some kind, and someone ALWAYS gets hurt.

My bagua sifu told me, however, that boxing would be better for me. 

""You mean something like white crane or tiger claw?"" I asked.

""No,"" he answered, ""Boxing. Western boxing.""

I was a little bit angry. I, being a sinophile of sorts, looked at kung fu as a cultural experience. Something that I would do after drinking tea. I felt sifu was driving me away towards something that was... less Chinese.

So I asked him, ""Why boxing?""

""Boxing is very simple,"" Sifu answered, ""Just like the internal arts, it will teach you how to find your power. Same ideas. Same principles. Plus, you're young enough to really *do* something with it.""

So I took his advice.

I joined a boxing gym. For the first month, I didn't learn anything. Just running, jump rope, squats, push-ups, etc. 

After what seemed like forever, I asked my trainer to teach me something. He demonstrated a jab. I tried it, but apparently I was doing it wrong. My balance was off, my chin moved past my knee, and I wasn't extending my shoulders enough. I asked him to teach me something else, but I was told that nothing would be taught until I perfected my jab.

For 6 months, I would come do my road work, jump rope, and work on my core. Then I'd critique my jab as I shadow boxed, test it out on the bag, but... something felt off. 

My jab wasn't doing a damn thing. It wasn't driving the bag back. It wasn't quick enough. It just had no *pop*.

How could I fail at something so... *simple*? How would I ever learn kung fu — the discipline I *really* wanted to learn — if I couldn't do something so simple as a jab? 

It wasn't rocket science. It was a simple Point A to Point B movement. Everyone else seemed to be able to do it. Why couldn't I?

Just as I was about to give up on kung fu and boxing and my dreams to be a martial artist, I came to the gym for one last try. And right before I did bag work, I decided to just play with the bag a little bit. Just give it a tap.

As I was tapping, I decided to give it something a little extra and — BOOM! — I drove the bag back!

WTF? I'd been working my ass off for months, and the one time I fooled around, I somehow accomplished my goal? 

Seemed unfair. So I kept hitting the bag with my jab. Nothing interesting happened — at least, not as interesting when I wasn't *really* doing bagwork.

I decided to pause. I retraced my steps. What was I doing differently when I fooled around?

Well, for one thing, I wasn't really trying to kick the bag's ass. I didn't load up. I wasn't tense. *I didn't even think about hitting the bag!*

But there was more to it. Right at the end of my jab, I did something extra. At *just* the right distance and moment, I changed my relaxed hand to a clenched fist. Then I twisted — creating an explosion of force!

And it wasn't just my fist either! It was my shoulders, and hips, and feet working in concert with each other. All this time doing road work, skipping rope, and doing core allowed me to find this *force* that would pulsate out from my knuckles. In effect, I realized my whole body was a coiled spring that could burst with energy at *just* the right moment.

Was this what my sifu was talking about in regards to the internal arts and chi?

I don't know. I'm not going to venture to guess. 

But what I will say is that doing something so *simple* as a jab isn't really simple at all, and power comes when you're not looking to be powerful.

Also, it's been 4 years. My jab and cross is pretty good, but my hooks and uppercuts leave a lot to be desired. I haven't mastered boxing. I doubt I ever will. I doubt I'll ever be good enough at boxing to ever learn kung fu.

That, paradoxically, is the answer to my question ""Why boxing?""",,False,,t5_2qkt4,False,,,True,t3_1b1548,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/1b1548/why_boxing/,

I restrained him. I, and the rest of the bar, throw him out. 

Whenever I'm in a fight, win or lose, I always try to go over every moment of what was said and done to see if the fight could have been prevented, fought more effectively, or to note and drill with what was particularly successful. I will give you all the breakdown as it happened and what I learned from it. Please feel free to interject observations or other lessons to consider.

I am waiting to go onstage at an open mic night. I am a comedian. I heard two guys at the end of the bar yelling, one guy, whom I know as a rowdy drunk, is being held back. We'll call him Mexican Napoleon. I walk over, hoping to talk down the situation. I fully expect that I might have to help eject Mexican Napoleon. But then Mr. Asshole at the bar keeps taunting him. Another patron asks him why he keeps provoking him, diplomatically trying to get him to cool it. Mexican Napoleon is pushed out. Mr. Asshole tells the diplomat patron to go fuck himself, and then tells me to go fuck myself because I'm standing near. I'm 5'10"", 180lbs, he looked to be 6'3"", easily over 200. He had big meat hook hands with the tell tale white residue of a calloused laborer. All I could think was how much it was going to hurt. He went after the diplomat patron and punched him in the head. I grabbed his arm, swung him into the bar in an arm lock. Lesson 1. I did not hold that arm lock with enough strength. I allowed him enough leverage to use his size against me. He broke loose and I was knocked back, tripping over a barstool on it's side. I was on by back and immediately kicked up as he came in. Close to a nut shot, but didn't connect. It gave me the time I needed to get on my feet. Another patron tried to grab him, and was thrown into a bar table. He backed toward the door and was surrounded, I was on my feet and he held guard. We screamed at him to leave. I made a point of telling him he'd have to fight the entire bar or the cops. I also loudly proclaimed that I had witnessed him batter two people. I used the term batter in hopes that it would take him out of the fight and into a courtroom mentally. I never told him to leave once he stopped attacking because I didn't want to fuel defiance. I let the option of leaving as his decision, but a very clear one. Then he left. And that was it. Over very quickly. 

The big take away lessons for me are that locks and holds are only useful if you practice them on a resisting opponent. Just knowing the technique is only a part of making the application useful. I'm certain had I been more practiced I would have held him against that bar. Second, practice ground technique. I have extraordinary balance, and I was knocked down. JiuJitsu guys are right. You will be on the ground. Third, even after blows, diplomacy is an option. I allowed him to leave - I didn't talk shit, threaten, challenge or escalate with him verbally. I just stood my ground and kept my hands up. I recently saw here in /r/martialarts a post about the SPEAR system, and I have to say I had been incorporating it into my drills. Even though I didn't use any specific SPEAR technique, when the final dialogue with him was going on I kept my hand up to maintain distance and to highlight a peaceful appeal, but ready to keep him at bay to follow up. I felt very relaxed and confident letting him determine the direction of the fight. Thanks for reading. I'm still going over the ""post-fight"" play by play in my head. And drills work. My muscle memory put him in an armlock before I could decide to do it. As soon as he swung, I had him spinning into the bar.",,False,,t5_2qkt4,1348184112.0,,,True,t3_107xfe,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/107xfe/got_into_a_fight_last_night_what_i_learned/,

1325184918.0,64,self.martialarts,nv73m,Just a testimonial about Martial Arts saving my ass last night,Wiremonkey,67,3,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/nv73m/just_a_testimonial_about_martial_arts_saving_my/,"Just a bit of background, I've been seriously doing martial arts of varying types for 8 years. When I was 15 I started Shorei Ryu Karate and did that for 3 years. My dojo also offered Muay Thai and Krav Maga. When I joined the Marines I had to leave home so a black belt eluded me. In the 5 years I did whatever I could to stay sharp, boxing, BJJ, muay thai, MCMAP etc. After the Marines earlier this year I came home with a host of joint problems from the military and haven't been able to seriously train until I get my MRI's from the VA. I was pleasantly surprised to find out last night that muscle memory still takes over even after a 6 month break. 

My friends and I were having a fair amount to drink and it was after last call. We stopped to get food at a place I frequent a lot. Since I bounce on the weekends I was shooting the shit with all the people I knew who party on Wed/Thurs since it's our weekends.  Anyway my companions started walking on and since we live in Boise, and one of my friends is black, trouble was bound to occur as we walk down the street.  I looked over in time to see one get shoved down to the ground and another one thrown up on the wall and get thrown on. There were no shit 6 of them and 3 of us. With food in my hand I ran up to pull them out and did the normal yell that cops are coming to break up fights when i got grabbed from behind and some other guy started hitting me in the face. (I should have seen it coming but lol alcohol). 

At that point training kicked in and I had to fight my way out of these guys. I wish I could say it looked like something out of a movie, but truth is these fights never come off clean. It's a blur but I remember headbutting the guy behind me, foot stomping him and escaping/tripping him down while still being hit. Next thing I remember Is covering up, thai clinching and going to town on some dude, breaking and staggering the guy with a hook, grabbing my buddies and getting out of there. 

What I really learned: Training saved my life. The police never came (which is weird because they always show up in like 30 seconds)and if I didn't know what I was doing chances are I wouldn't be typing this right now. Everyone should be able to defend themselves, don't wait on the police to save you.  I currently have a inch and a half vertical cut from the bridge of my nose and a black eye but it could have been way, way worse. Also thank god for the VA treating me so that the costs are manageable!

Well, well, well, I thought. If it isn't the old TKD school. Or a sister school, now that I take a second look.

I started in the 90s and was in it for eleven years, far longer than was necessary to get my second degree, but towards the end I'd definitely become disillusioned, and I wasn't very active for several years. I'd skip classes, tournaments, testing, etc. The tests, by the way, are fucking expensive. 

Two things:

1) This WMAA organization is an offshoot of the World TaeKwonDo Association, which was under the late Grandmaster Duk Sung Son, and is no longer extant. It has disbanded since his death and is now represented by several offshoot schools. These schools are, in fact, nationwide and I understand there are quite a few in other countries, like Australia.

2) On a personal note, I stayed in it for as long as I did because I had a lot of friends in it, and we partied extremely, extremely hard. I'm still friends today with many of them. Martial arts-wise, I left and wandered around a few styles for many years, but nowadays have a home in a legit gym doing mma, Danzan Ryu jujitsu, western boxing, and judo. I also cross-train as much as possible in bjj, FMA, IDPA shooting, etc.

**I'm at work now, but will answer as many questions as possible when I get home and my wife and kid go to bed. I should be in front of a keyboard by midnight tonight, 21 June '13 Fri, ET. AMA!**

EDIT: Good heavens! I've got some keyboard time ahead of me, here. First things first, though, by way of proof: I dug up my certificate and belt. [Here's a shitty phonecam pic](http://i.imgur.com/mT4py48.jpg).

1365017459.0,55,self.martialarts,1blvrl,"This Saturday, history is being made...",youhavethenerve,63,8,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/1blvrl/this_saturday_history_is_being_made/,"This weekend marks something historic. Zou Shiming is making his professional boxing debut in Macao. It is a debut that will be watched by an estimated 500 million Chinese people. 

But the significance of this event has ramifications beyond one individual’s potential to be a superstar. To explain these ramifications, I must give a bit of a history lesson.

Different cultures like England, Russia, and Greece have an indigenous tradition of pugilism. Likewise, China also has such a tradition. 

About 2,000 years ago, a Chinese book entitled *The Combat Arts of Two Hands* appeared. It was a book exclusively about boxing techniques. Unfortunately, this book disappeared from print. Nevertheless, traditional Chinese martial arts such as Xingyiquan, Choi Lai Fat, and Wing Chun — while implementing techniques *beyond* boxing — place special emphasis on fist techniques. 

When Westerners came to China, they brought Western boxing with them.  At first, the sport in China appeared as an unregulated street sport pitting foreign sailers against local fighters who had experience in Chinese traditional martial arts. Western boxing became popular, and the sport grew rapidly.

In the 1920s, a book entitled *The Technique of Western Boxing* was translated into Chinese. This was followed up with sports academies putting Western boxing classes in their major curriculum. At the 1936 Berlin Olympics, China assigned 69 athletes as participants. Two of them were boxers. 

Then after World War II, boxing competitions began popping up in all major Chinese cities. The grandest boxing tournament in Chinese history had 142 participants show up in Beijing. The legendary Bruce Lee is known to have participated in an amateur boxing tournament.

Unfortunately, Western boxing was banned in China in 1959. It was believed that boxing was too brutal and too worthless — and had characteristics of capitalism. An entire generation of Chinese boxers were forced to hang up the gloves. 

Then in 1979, something changed. At the invitation of Chairman Deng Xiaoping, Muhammad Ali paid a visit to China. In their visit, Ali was seen hugging Deng. After this visit, Deng exclaimed, “If we want to win friends, if we want to win respect, we have to win medals”.

Boxing in China was reborn in 1987 when the ban was lifted. Chinese boxers began training again. Lacking the proper equipment, they used sandbags instead of gloves. There was an obvious gulf in quality between China and the rest of the world, but with persistent effort, once again China competed in boxing at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. 

Then in 2004, Zou Shiming won bronze at the Athens Olympics. In doing so, he became the first Chinese to actually medal. If this was Shiming’s lone achievement, it would be significant. But he was just getting started.

In 2005 and 2007, Shiming won gold in the World Amateur Championships. It became apparent that Shiming was someone truly special. During this time, he developed a rivalry with Pürevdorjiin Serdamba of Mongolia — who beat Shiming in the 2007 Asian Championship Games.

Then 2008 Beijing Olympics came. Shiming met Serdamba in the finals. Millions of Chinese tuned to watch these rivals compete. In the course of the fight, Serdamba was forced to retire due to injury. Zou burst into tears. He had won China’s first ever Olympic boxing gold medal.

China would win another boxing gold medal in the 2008 Olympics. Zhang Xiaoping would win one at light heavyweight. These two medals marked China's arrival as a power in amateur boxing.

But there was no doubt that Shiming was Chinese boxing’s biggest star. After the 2008 Olympics, Shiming would win gold 2010 Asian Games as well as the 2011 World Amateur Championships. Many began to wonder if Shiming could pull off a rarity and win another Olympic gold medal in London.

At 31-years-old, Shiming entered the finals against Kaeo Pongprayoon of Thailand. With controversy, Shiming narrowly won with scores of 13-10. In this, he won his second Olympic gold medal.

Which now brings us to this moment in time. Zou Shiming, China’s most famous combat sports athlete, is making his debut this Saturday. 

China already has a championship fighter in Ziong Zhao Zhong who holds the WBC title at minimumweight. They also have several exciting prospects in the pro ranks — one of whom is Rex Tso who’s promoted by Ricky Hatton.

But just as Zou Shiming marked China as a great power in amateur boxing, his debut next Saturday may potentially mark them as a great power in professional boxing. The whole world will be watching him — including America where the event will be broadcast on HBO2. 

What will the future hold? Brian Viloria, who’s also fighting on the card, holds the WBA and WBO flyweight titles. Shiming and Viloria are primed for a showdown in 2014.

Should a Shiming-Viloria fight happen, this will be one of the most watched fights in boxing history.",,False,,t5_2qkt4,1365021643.0,,,True,t3_1blvrl,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/1blvrl/this_saturday_history_is_being_made/,

He made martial arts (Karate) the absolute best experience that a kid could hope for. He was one of the kindest, most dedicated, and most talented people I've ever known. 

He died very suddenly at age 32, shortly after starting his new job as a Canadian Border Officer. He left behind a wife, and a (then) two-year-old daughter. He had completed this book a short time before he died, but he never got to see it published.

I would really appreciate if any of you could have a look at it. I'm not doing this for affiliate money (I don't even know how), and I don't personally know his family at all. I hadn't even seen my Sensei for several years before he died. I'm just one of many people whose lives were changed for the better by this incredible man.

Thank you to everyone who posted their stories before, as well! Despite style, I consider black belts to be a large family, and I am so happy to be a part of it!

BTW, this is also my brother's account of what happened:

Anyways, my brother was interested in Wing Chun for a long time. He called up a place that was known to have some reasonable Wing Chun and told the instructor he had a little bit of MMA experience (even though all he had was Taekwondo and wrestling). Apparently, this Wing Chun guy emphatically told my brother to come down after hearing that. My brother thought the enthusiasm was one for a new customer.

Excited, my brother went to the gym 30 minutes early to meet with the instructor. After introductions, they both went to the floor. This was without any formal signing of waivers or contracts. 

On the floor, the instructor asked my brother questions to gauge his ability such as what would you do if I punched you this way? That makes sense right? But as this progressed, he started actually hitting my brother in his arm and his stomach as he asked these questions. 

It culminated to the point where my brother picked this guy up to show him what he would do and after setting the instructor down, was punched in the face twice. My brother wisely walked away after this instead of retaliating and the instructor yelled at him, ""Yeah get your ass out of here punk!""

My brother has talked to the police and to my father but both of them are severely discouraging action. Lawyers of course won't make any money from this either so they're not giving him any good information other than simple assault cases are only handled by DA's etc etc... will take about a year.... can't help you yada yada...

I am severely frustrated with the law and my father right now and how little they're helping my brother after this assault case. My brother is a strong guy for his age but he's still just a boy and me being so far away can't really help him.

What should I do? I posted here hoping maybe other martial artists might have seen this happen before and tell me what they did (or what I can do).

Edit: Thank you guys for the information. I've decided to hurt the guy's business reputation. I'm going to wait a couple of weeks to protect my brother's identity because trust me, once I post the name of the school, you will get the master's name. You'll also know exactly where it's at and see that it's been relocated and everything. I'll probably post it on yelp and name the school here on this post.

1338840222.0,44,self.martialarts,ukqxk,My experiences with martial arts and violence. ,Eric_Bordner1,61,17,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/ukqxk/my_experiences_with_martial_arts_and_violence/,"Honestly, all it takes is a few fights or sketchy situations to realize that everything martial arts related can work , but its the person putting it into use that has the flaws. 

I have been in a good amount of fights and I have entered into a good amount of tournaments , I have fought in cages and on gym floors as well as on streets , I have fought with groups of people as well as been ""jumped"" by multiple people. I have fought for ego and I have fought to prove I was tough , I have fought for self-defense reasons and I have fought to have fun. I have fought in front of crowds of people and I have fought in front of a few people. 

I have ""lost"", I have been beaten up, I have had parts of my body disfigured, and I have had so many varying degrees of mental instability/stability that I probably have aged myself well beyond my years. 

I have been in altercations involving knifes, bats , wooden 2x4's, and other weird objects. I have fought people who could grapple, who could jab like a fucking right hand , who were afraid to fight , and who seemed to have no fear. All of it doesn't mean shit. Violence SUCKS

BUT. It happens, weather I brought it upon myself or it came on its own. 

I have learned that nothing is definite and fighting is always scary because you will never have any true understanding of what another person is capable of. Honestly, I don't even know what I am capable of or how I will react until after its done. Welcoming Violence is welcoming death into your life, and anyone who has felt violence knows that even when the situation is done and you survived, you will have loads of work to do with your mind and you will never ever be the same person afterwords. 

However, Martial Arts play a great role in training your body parts to move fluently , and to react to randomness a bit quicker. That reaction to the randomness of any situation will make all the difference for better or worse. 

Martial Arts will also build your confidence , that confidence is what will allow you to believe in whatever decision you choose , strike , grapple, run , call for help , ask for mercy, or fight to survive. or a combination of all of the above. 

However, real-life fights are not movie scripts, and everyday a person is different, you never know what that person has just went through and where their mind is at. Did they just run 6 miles yesterday and they are sluggish,  did they just get divorced and no longer know which direction is up, are they well-rested and on the prowl to be alpha for the moment. Who knows, you don't know , I won't know , and honestly even they will not know. 

What does seem to help  , is being quick , being smart , BREATHING, not letting your adrenaline take over until it needs too ( which is really really really hard to do, and never will be a sure thing ) , explosiveness and ruthleness. 

Those things will help you survive , but they will not keep you out of trouble or keep you from what happens afterwords. 

Basically whoever made it this far , walk the fuck away always. Or be prepared for a constant battle with PTSD 

Honor and Glory are fake and only ever please the ego and those who live for the ego. The idea of being a warrior and might lift you into a fantasy world of greatness for a second, but the awful truth is that you will forever be scarred and most people will never be able to relate to your instability. Walking alone through a world sucks, and so does being prepared for violence everywhere you go. 

but most of you will not listen and will have to go through the journey yourself. good luck ",,False,,t5_2qkt4,False,,,True,t3_ukqxk,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/ukqxk/my_experiences_with_martial_arts_and_violence/,

This bothered me quite a bit.  While i do agree that there are many techniques in traditional martial arts that only work while fighting an opponent of the same background, many do have real world applications.  I have a black belt in tdk, trained in hapkido, muy thai, little bit of king fu, little wrestling, and am now training judo.  Again i agree that there are useless techniques but, if trained properly, most martial arts can be effective in real world combat.  Ill be the first to admit that i learned some dumb shit in tkd that would never work in a real fight.  Having said that there is still a lot that can be applied in real world situations, especially if your opponent has no experience other that scrapping in the street.  Its all about knowing the difference between the two.  Knowing what to apply and what to dump.  Bruce Lee himself said something along the lines of taking what is usefull and dumping the rest.  I have personally used what i have learned in a few situations, most recently about 3 weeks ago when i got involved in a scrap with some jerkoff on the street, and i wrecked his shit using a combination of everything i have learned.

I am a mid-level Wing Tzun student under Emin Boztepe.  I did my research and went to the best school in my area based on competition wins and local reviews (bullshido and sherdog).

I was very respectful, I took it seriously, and tried to get the most out of the class as I could.  I learned O-Goshi and Kesa Gatame.  At the end, I asked one of the blackbelts to toss me around a bit.  I really wanted to know how it felt.  He was game.  It was a little awkward at first because he was holding back, but once he realized I was serious and I could handle it (not spazzing), things got really fun.  *** I didnt throw any punches, I would arm-shove instead. For throws, he would get me to where I was done for, and let me roll off.  Sweeps, reaps, and trips were open season.  

Here is what I took away from the experience:

* Judo is tremendous fun and I would recommend it to anyone.  Everyone there was super chill.  

* Wing Tzun (at least as taught by Boztepe) holds up against Judo.  I was never out of my depth or comfort zone.  Given that the guy was way better at Judo than I am at Wing Tzun, I feel I did exceptionally well.  The head Sensei said he was pretty impressed.  

* It is easier to get taken down than I thought.

* It was harder for them to take me down than they thought.

* Maybe their national competitors are beasts, but rank and file Judo guys arent any stronger than me or the guys in my class.  But, in fairness, our school takes strength and conditioning pretty seriously, and that is not universal for Wing Chun.

* My athleticism and balance matter way way more in fighting than which style I do.  

* I used textbook Chum Kiu applications, chi-sao, and chi-gerk to prevent takedowns, sweeps, and throws with a fair amount of success.   When I did get taken down, it felt the same as losing a Wing Tzun exchange, not like I was destroyed by superior moves.  

* Style wars only exist on the internet.  In the real world, everyone seemed pretty impressed with what I could do, given that I was not a grappler by training.  They especially liked my footwork and counter-sweeps.

Most people that attended a class in the school where I study Systema have been impressed by the quality of what they were taught. Most of these people are experienced in martial arts and have been practicing for years before discovering Systema. Some are policemen, bouncers, bodyguards, etc. They all found what they needed in Systema.

On this subreddit, Systema has been tagged by most as a ""bullshido"". From what I understand, this view is mostly based on youtube videos. I watched a lot of these and I completely understand how they can create such an opinion. 

Some of these videos show people moving very slowly, doing things that obviously would not work in a real fight. Out of the context of a systema class, these drills make no sense, but they are that, drills, not techniques. In the same way, someone could look a martial artist do push-ups and say ""This is stupid, push-up don't work in a real fight"".

Other videos seem incredible. When we watch Ryabko (a fat man who looks nothing like a trained martial artist) or Vladimir Vasiliev hit a big russian in the stomach and the man seems to be on the verge of crying, we think that it is faked. Well, it is not. I have been in a seminar with Vasiliev and I have felt the incredible power of the man.

Some videos are simply too much. We see a man using his psychic powers tu push people without as much as touching them. Well. This is bullshit. But before dismissing a complete martial art because some idiots make weirds videos, please remember that the founder of Aikido is said to have been able to teleport, dodge bullets and... push people without touching them. There is bullshit available, it is not a valid reason to dismiss an entire discipline.

""But, why would I practice Systema when Krav Maga is so much better ?""

Krav Maga is an incredibly efficient combat system. To argue against that would be misinformed at best. However, the idea that both Systema and Krav Maga are self-defense systems with different approaches if erroneous. From what I know (and I must say that it is not much) from Krav Maga, it is a flinch-response system based on developping reflexes that are more adequate to combat than natural reflexes. While it it very efficient, this kind of training may be harmful. Also, Krav Maga is just that, a combat system.

Systema, on the other hand, it more than that. Yes it is a combat system, but it is also an incredibly complete workout system and includes healing techniques. More importantly, it focuses on breathing concepts (the most important thing in Systema) and psychological education (how to deal with the aftermath of combat without getting PTSD, etc). There is only so much I can write about the teachings of Systema on a reddit post.

""But there is no sparring in systema, no pressure testing""

I honestly have no idea where that comes from. It is false. There is a lot of sparring and pressure testing.

""These people simply soak hits directly in the stomach. It is stupid, dangerous and definitely not something I would do in combat !""

Believe it or not, when we hit each other really hard, it is a breathing drill. We are taught to move in combat, avoid being hit. Also, in the classes where these drills happen, we have a lot of warm-up to prepare the body for such a shock. 

""I attended a Systema class and it sucked""

Every martial art has some poor teachers. I met one myself that was incredibly dangerous for anyone who trained with him. And he stank. Systema is little known and there is no belt system. Some people use that fact to declare themselves instructors with no real competence. If you attend a systema class and it sucks, don't come back.

Some schools tend to distance themselves from the traditionnal Russian methods and beliefs. These schools put a lot of enphasis on pressure testing and sparring, making sure that no bullshit is taught simply because it has been taught to them. ""Combat Systema"" is such a modern approach that some teachers are taking.

There's been a leak from my flat into the flat below so I assumed it was the people from downstairs. It wasn't. As I opened the door I was faced with a shaven headed neanderthal of a chav. He first tried to push into my flat so I stopped him. Then he said ""they said I could come in here for a beer"" I responded ""well, you can't"". The conversation is a little fuzzy as I ended up with a little adrenalin flowing. The gist of it was he decided that he was going to let off a fire extinguisher outside my flat. I didn't give a shit at first but when I realised that he might be planning to hit me with it (the fire extinguisher) I decided to take it away from him. He struggled a bit but not too much. I took the fire extinguisher and put it behind me, inside my flat. He tried to push me away and into my flat. He failed. I remember that he seemed to be trying to goad me into a fight saying things like ""you're a fat fucking cunt"" (I am a fairly hefty gentleman at 17 stone and 6 foot 2) and kept trying to push his way in. I wasn't really responding to what he was saying but I remember thinking ""his right hand is his power hand"" and just controlling his right bicep with my left hand, leaving my right hand free. The other thing I was thinking was ""there is no way he can move right now that I can't respond to by using my right elbow against his face then pushing him down the stairs"".  

The last things I can remember him saying to me were ""do you think I'm going to mug you?"" to which I replied ""no"" and thought ""I really doubt that you can"". Then he left. 

Throughout the whole encounter I had a perfect position to attack and I could see both of his hands so there was no real threat. I'm pretty sure he was trying to intimidate me but the whole thing has just left me feeling a little bit confused and distant.

Should I have done anything differently (run-fu obviously not an option in this situation and he had his leg on my doorframe so I couldn't just shut the door without escalating the situation)? Also what the fuck was it about?

I was a five year martial artist at the time.  I trained a heavy bag for cardio, was at the gym most of the week, and practiced form and techniques for months to get ready.  I lost hard.  While I had done drills, I did not do a lot of them.  I also did next to zero actual fighting to prepare for the competition.  It was disappointing to find out that my everyday training did not prepare me for a fight, as is often advertised.  The experience was enlightening and gave me a new perspective on martial arts training.  Now I am trying to integrate fighting and fighting drills with my traditional training.

thoughts I've been having. This is part rant, part ponderous, part educational and 100% opinionated. Please prefix every
sentence of this text with ""in my opinion"" before complaining.


**The (sad) state of aikido today**

I don't want to write too much about this as most peoply won't likely be interested in the internal politics of aikido
and how it has affected the art itself, but I feel I have to give some background to make the rest of this post clearer.
To quickly sum it up: most of the aikido practised today is crap. There are a few reasons for it:

* Lack of quality control by the International Aikido Federation. I'm sad to say it, but it seems that they are more
interested in getting the money coming in from graduations than they are on the quality of the art.

* The focus of IAF on making aikido more widespread and ""accessible"" has taken the edge out of the art. I couldn't find the
exact quote, but Kisshomaru Ueshiba has been recorded as saying something in the lines of ""Aikido had to be changed to
make it suitable for normal people.""

* (I have preface this point as being hearsay, but it comes from a source I trust highly) A lot of the high ranked aikidoka
aren't interested in open discussion about these things. They seem to be happy with the current system and the status they
have earned within it.

* There is an alarmingly large percentage of aikido teachers who either think that aikido isn't effective as a martial art
or aren't interested in its effectiveness. And if you don't think it's effective, obviously you won't teach it in an
effective way.

* The importance of many things like tegatana and kokyo has been largely lost.

* Even if all those things were corrected, aikido is still hard as hell to teach. It's subtle, unintuitive to most people,
demands a style of moving the body that is very different from what modern people (especially in the western world) aren't
used to and is very dependant on correct technique: if your technique is off, then you're shit out of luck; trying to muscle
an aikido technique gone wrong will only make it worse.


**It isn't just wristlocks you know (or: how the basic principles of aikido should be taught)**

A lot of aikido schools heavily base their beginners curriculum on techniques against wristgrabs. As a result, students
easily focus too much on the movement of the arms and fail to understand the principles and importance of body movement. And
when that happens they are left completely defenseless if somebody attacks them in way that makes the arms useless. They will
later on be taught stuff that requires more, of course, but at that point they will in all likelihood already have developed
bad habits and misunderstandings. Contrast to that, if the beginners training is focused more on ""whole body attacks"" like
grabbing the shoulders, upper arms or chest/collar area, students are forced to move their whole body as a unit to make the
techniques work. After getting the body movement right, learning all that fancy wristwork is relatively easy.

Another important point is that techniques should be taught more from kihon (that is, starting from standing still). In kihon,
students don't have large amounts of opponents momentum to take advantage of so they have to activate the situation themselves,
which leads to better understanding of the technique. Sadly, kihon training seems to be underappriciated these days, perhaps
because it doesn't look (and feel) that flashy.

Also, there should be more emphasis on the connection between different techniques. If students aren't made clear that there
is a common ""core"" to all techniques and what that core is, they will focus more on superficial aspects instead.


**Try to understand what happens and why, otherwise you're just dancing in a funny way**

In this section I will try to outline the elements of an effective aikido technique. I have kept each part short for
readability, if some of them are too short please tell so in the comments and I will try to elaborate.

* Connection: You have a center of mass. Your opponent has a center of mass. The attack forms a connection point. The goal
is to form a strong connection between those centers of mass through that connection point and then do stuff with it. If you
don't have a connection to your opponents center, everything else is pretty much pointless. Your fancy wristlocks won't save
you if the rest of the opponents body is moving freely.

* Destabilisation: After you get that connection (or, more precisely, at the same time you get it) you need to take your
opponents balance. A stable opponent is strong, an unstable opponent is weak. So how do you do it? By using that connection
to take your opponents center of mass outside his base of support. At that point, the laws of physics will do your work for
you. After destabilisation the opponent should be kept in a constant state of unstability troughout the technique.

* Body structure: Destabilising the opponent only helps if you keep yourself stable and strong. Maintain a low center of mass.
Keep your hands in front of your chest and stomach, that is where they are strongest. Keep your arms slightly bent: if they
are bent too much you have to use a lot of muscle, if they are too straight you can't use any muscle. Relax your shoulders and
upper arms, but not your forearms (it helps if you keep your hands flat and spread open). Straighten your back and hold your
head up (almost to the point where you look a bit snobbish). Engage your core muscles. Breath correctly, it works wonders.

* Body movement: Moving yourself is always easier than moving your opponent, so do that (this seems obvious, but surprisingly
many still try the opposite). If you move in the correct way with good body structure while maintaining the connection, the
opponent will be forced to react.

* Direction of force: There are angles where the muscles are naturally strong and angles where the muscles are naturally weak.
The force vectors should be made so that your strength goes against your opponents weakness. After you start applying force,
the angles change and you must correct accordingly. This results in the spherical movement typical to aikido.

* Atemi: Sometimes the direction you move in to keep force vectors ideal isn't safe. Learn to recognise these situations and
apply atemi to create space and to make your opponent use his hands to block instead of hitting you. Atemi should also be used
when you want to maintain proper distance. According to Morihei Ueshiba, 90% of a real fight is atemi, so when in doubt, hit.

* Timing: ""For aikido to work, it should be done a millimeter from death."" If you move too soon, your opponent can counter.
If you move too late, you have already lost. There is a moment as short as the blink of an eye where your opponent hasn't yet
succeeded but already thinks he will. Move decisively at that exact moment.",,False,,t5_2qkt4,False,,,True,t3_p11mw,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/p11mw/thoughts_on_aikido/,

1366774506.0,35,self.martialarts,1czjez,Did my Taekwondo instructor cross the line today at practice or am I reading into it too much?,tkdgirl16,41,6,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/1czjez/did_my_taekwondo_instructor_cross_the_line_today/,"I am very new to Taekwondo (only taken 4 classes). The first3 classes were great, and we were all in a group of people and learning kicks and blocks. I thought it was a bit odd that we weren't taught proper breathing from the start, or anything about what Taekwondo is. But that's besides the point.

Anyway, today I showed up for class and I was the only one. So I thought, ok cool I get a private lesson today! So it was just me and the teacher. I'm a 22 year old girl and the teacher is about a 45 year old man. He's Korean so because of his accent I have a hard time understanding him sometimes, even though I speak some Korean.

So I usually end up a bit confused because of the language barrier but it wasn't a huge deal because I thought it was more authentic because he was Korean.

My issue is with what happened today during our private lesson. He was teaching me blocks (high, mid, low) which was great to start out with. He would get really up close behind me to fix my stance or my arms - which didn't bother me since that makes total sense.

But then he switched it to a self defense class, which I'm not sure if that's something everyone learns when they start, it might be. But he started coming up and hugging me really close and putting his face really close to mine with his arms around my back and he taught me how to deflect that. That was still okay with me because I'm not sure if that's used in Taekwondo or not but it seemed useful even though he was getting really really close to my face.

Then he came up to me and said ""Now if a guy grabs you like this..."" and then he proceeded to grab my ass, before even asking me or really giving me any warning. I thought this was weird mostly because his face was in the same spot as it was when he was just grabbing behind my back, and with his hands on my ass he was still telling me to deflect him in the same exact way as I was doing when he just had his hands on my back. I didn't understand the extra need to put his hands on my ass. I understand that I might get attacked like that on the street, yea it's possible. But couldn't he just explain it, or at least keep his hands on my back because it's pretty much close enough without...touching me. And he asked me to do it back to him, to grab his ass as he showed me how to deflect it and I don't know I just felt uncomfortable.

Am I reading into it too much? Is this just common for a teacher to get really close like this to teach a student what would happen in a real life situation or does this set off any red flags for anyone else. Please let me know because I want to make sure I'm learning as much as I can and I'm going to a good school and have a good instructor. I don't just want to learn self defense moves that one could learn in a class at their gym. I want to learn taekwondo, and the korean names of the moves...etc.

Thanks guys. I just feel uncomfortable after class tonight.

**TL;DR - Very new to TKD, not sure how instructor/student interactions should be. Instructor grabbed my ass tonight during a private lesson to show me how to deflect it. Currently uncomfortable w/the situation. Not sure if this is normal.**

Edit: Now that I think about it, he also was grazing my boobs with his hands, and not so accidentally it seemed. And afterwards he came up behind me and told me to cross my arms and he did that thing where someone lifts you up and shakes you to crack your back. I was so confused because he didn't tell me what he was doing so I assumed it was a tkd technique or something. Then he asked me to do it to him, and dear god I'm a small girl, I can't lift a full grown man! I tried because he asked me to but I couldn't really do it so he just laughed nervously and told me I did a good job. Felt super weird. Forgot to add that part.

**EDIT 2: Just went back to the school to get all my money back since I had just recently paid and barely had finished my trial period. I went with my dad so I didn't have to risk being alone with him when I confronted him and told him why I wanted my money back. He complied and now I have the money and will be putting it towards a much better school. Now thanks to everyone's extremely helpful comments, I know what to look for before paying next time.

I feel like this is a wake up call that clearly something is going wrong in my training, anybody else ever have a similar experience? 

EDIT: A lot of people asking for more details, so here goes: I go up to my local convenience store a little after midnight, and I see a guy pissing on the door. I live nearby, and come to this store all the time, so I cuss him out, tell him to stop being an ass and fuck off. As he starts asking me why I care, his 2 buddies come around the corner a few feet away. 

Now I decide it's time to calm down and walk away, but one of them jumps on me, I push him away with a front kick but his buddies keep me from being effective. One of them grabs my shirt and goes for my face.

And I tell him to stop. A guy is punching me in the face and I don't block, I don't go for the groin, I don't punch or kick. I say you have 5 seconds to stop. He keeps punching me in the face. By now his buddies have backed off, so I put a hand on his throat and squeeze lightly. He backs up in surprise, and I vamoose. Broken nose, and bloodied and I didn't even block or strike back. 

 After years of doing everything my sifu said, I couldn't use anything I've trained when I needed it most. Not fighting back hurts.

She hit hard too, like a man. She was fast and accurate, obviously had training. It was over really fast, she knocked him into some chairs from an outdoor cafe and he decided not to get back up.

I'll start:

The first school i trained at was a knock-off American Top Team that gives a bad name to the entire franchise.

* To start off, there were at most 2-3 people in every class, but i chalked it up to being a new school and hoped that it would pick up pace.



* When they finally found a Muay Thai instructor he would never refer to me by my name but rather as ""the worst one"" and ""the one with the terrible jab""

* Whenever i asked a question i was met with "" *sigh* i don't know why this is so hard for you to understand""

* fast forward a bit, every damn class they would make fun of my vale tudo shorts -_-

* The instructors eventually stopped showing up and only appeared when it was convenient for them

* During conditioning classes they (the instructors) would always make fun of me and tell me how i was proportionally weaker than the women in the class.   


Why did it take me so long to leave? Well i thought i just needed to toughen up, but after attending a different American Top Team and seeing the world of difference as well as the environment conducive to learning, i was convinced that my first school was wack as hell.

The slightly newer fighter swept the more experienced fighter, and they fell poorly, landing back of head first. We checked for immediate signs of concussion, and any ill effects. Seemingly, there were none, and they continued the spar. We found out later that the person ended up having very short term, and some long term amnesia (For about six hours after the match) and a pretty serious concussion. The interesting thing though, was that they then proceeded to wipe the floor with the other fighter, despite being unaware of what was happening, being extremely in control, fighting masterfully, better than they ever had, appearing to gain maybe three to five years of solid training. They did not remember the match after, and returned to normal skill level once they hit their next match a month or so later. Needless to say I'm a still a bit perplexed.

1376559467.0,35,self.martialarts,1kernz,stick vs rope – another major difference between wing chun an karate + some physics,shashkes,42,7,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/1kernz/stick_vs_rope_another_major_difference_between/,"It sounds like a cliché’ and I’m pretty sure I’ve heard others use this distinction when describing the differences between karate and wing chun but after a month and a half of win chun training (and 16 years of karate or so) today was the first time I felt it on myself and it was pretty cool.

I’ve been doing some pushing hands for years, even in my karate group but today something finally clicked. 
In karate we deal with opposing force coming towards us either by applying a greater force (i.e. kicks your opponent as he moves towards you or block a punch) or by moving so the force doesn't come in contact with you but instead glides past you. Today I realized something wing chun does which I have never encountered in Karate, it disperses the force by allowing it to dissipate through the lose joints of the body.
To explain this I’m going to have to use some physics so bear with me.

The force of a hit creates a pressure wave that moves through the body. In karate we practice a lot to focus this wave so it will go deep into the body and create the most damage (minimizing the surface area we hit with and the duration of the hit while maximizing acceleration and mass). 

I’ve already noticed that when wing chun people block they maximize the duration of the block but today I noticed something very new to me. They don’t really block! They wait for the pressure wave to reach each joint which is completely relaxes. When the wave reaches their elbow it sort of collapses inwards and next comes their shoulder, then the remainder of the force will be used to move their hips and get out of the way, perhaps it even starts with their wrist. 

It’s like hitting a rope, the extra degrees of freedom mean that the instead of traveling straight on to the body, the pressure wave disperses through each joint weakening it.
It felt really amazing to manage to relax into a “block” and feel this space in my elbows. My only question is what amount of force can this tactic withstand and how fast can my joints adapt?

*Edit, I found some more context for the pictures.

****WARNING EXTREMELY GRAPHIC****

These photos are of an officer trained in hand-to-hand combat.  The officer figured, due to his size and fighting skills, he could disarm a knife wielding aggressor. This is vivid proof of how deadly people who are ""only armed with a knife"" can be.  Some of the public think that officers should try to disarm someone armed with a knife but anyone who has had training in knife fighting will tell you - even if you win you are going to get cut. Keep this in the back of your mind when confronting someone armed with an edged weapon.

1360741354.0,28,self.martialarts,18fnle,In My Opinion: The Biggest Difference Between a McDojo and a Legitimate School (Long Story),informedly_baffled,36,8,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/18fnle/in_my_opinion_the_biggest_difference_between_a/,"Hey guys, I recently had an experience that really put into perspective for me the differences between McDojos and legitimate schools and thought I should share it with you. I've had my fair share of McDojo experience, and I know the basic signs: Too-fast promotions, super-binding contracts, etc. When I was younger, I had the bad fortune to watch the school I trained at, once a legitimate institution, rapidly decline to the status of McDojo as the Master became increasingly greedy. Unfortunately, I was also a kid, so I was somewhat blind to it. 

Three years ago, I decided I was going to go back to this school that I knew had become a McDojo, against my better judgement, because they were the only school in my area of New York that offered Muay Thai classes. So I signed up. They gave me sort of a ""special"" contract because I had trained there from the time I was 7 until I was 15, and I was friends with the Muay Thai instructor. I took classes for three months and felt like I learned nothing. The classes were the same exact thing every day. Warm up, shadow box, kick pads, spar. No real technique training, no serious amount of instruction. I used the class as a supplement to my karate class. We did regular ju-kumite in Karate, but I wanted the full-contact sparring that this class offered as well.

One day, I'm sparring and end up having a very unfortunate accident. I took a step back to dodge a punch, tripped over a gym bag that was negligently left on the floor, and crashed into a bench. I ended up being seriously injured. The second I hit the bench I started screaming in pain, it hurt like nothing I'd ever felt before. I'm rolling around in pain, and all the THREE instructors there do is as follows:

* Instructor 1 continues sparring.
* Instructor 2 makes a joke at my expense.
* Instructor 3 (who was the instructor I believed to be my friend) looks over, looks away and starts making himself busy organizing pads.

Finally, I muster the strength to lift myself up and run to the bathroom. Standing in the bathroom, I find out that I'm bleeding profusely. Blood is getting all over my hands and the floor, and the person I was sparring sees this and freaks out. He asks if there's anything he can do to help, so I have him grab my phone. I call my parents, and 15 minutes later, my dad arrives. Now, I've been injured for 20 minutes at this point, bleeding all over. And the three instructors have continued to ignore my cries for help. No one has called an ambulance, offered me ice, gauze, or so much as checked to see if I was okay. My dad makes a scene and calls the ambulance himself. Finally, my dad convinces them to give me an ice pack. I was bedridden, unable to walk or move too much without bleeding/pain for three weeks. Out of commission for another month and a half after that. The only time anyone from the school so much as attempted to check on me was to make sure I wouldn't sue.

Fast forward to yesterday night. I'm now in college in Boston and I have just started taking Muay Thai classes at a gym nearby. I had an existing injury to my left knee that was pretty serious earlier in the year, but I'd left alone and learned to ignore. As I'm hitting pads, my knee suddenly gives way, pretty much buckles sideways, and I fall to the ground in pain. Now, I've had knee injuries before and this definitely hurt the most out of all of them, but it was far from the worst injury I've ever had. I was in pain, sure, but I handled it fine. In this case however, every single instructor in the gym at the time, including the ones who weren't teaching came over to see if I was okay. One offered to call an ambulance, but another instructor told him not to, as it would cost me too much money, and then offered to drive me to the hospital himself. I'd never met this instructor before. They gave me ice, motrin, and water while they waited for me to determine if my injury was serious enough to merit going to the hospital. Finally, I decided it was, the instructor who offered me the ride pulled his car around, dropped me off in the emergency room, wished me well, told me that he hoped to see me again because he'd grown to like me in that short time, and left.

I'm currently on crutches, with an MRI scheduled to determine whether my knee injury is a combination of a bad sprain plus either a meniscus or ACL tear. Seeing as I've torn my meniscus in my right knee before and it hurt nowhere near as bad as my left does now, I'm not expecting the best. However, I was beyond impressed by how caring the instructors at this school were. They'd known me some for only a few days, and some not at all, yet every single one truly cared for my well being and wanted to see me well again. They went out of their way to make sure I got all the help I needed. It was truly amazing to me.

TL;DR: I'm extremely injury prone. McDojos laugh at your obviously serious injuries. Legitimate schools care about even the ones that seem potentially minor and go out of their way to help.

I have been bullied allthrough school, pre university and college. Also, some bullying at my workplace.

Redditors, will it be a good idea if I learn some martial arts. Will it help me gain confidence and courage.
What happens to me when I get bullied: 
I just feel like shouting at people when they pass remarks, make fun of me. But, I start shivering from inside, feel jittery and my heart starts pounding...and I just don't react. This obviously gives other's the impression that I am chickening out...so there is more humiliation. I never get respect as a person because I do not stand up:(


People knowing martial arts...throw some perspective on this. I am sure you were scared earlier and MA has helped you get a confident personality.....

EDIT: Thank you all for the advice and suggestions. After reading through each of these posts(and replying to some), I believe that MA will atleast help me gain that confidence on which I can build on a defence mechanism when in a tough situation.

But rather than me submitting giant straw man, here is one of the most popular sites defining it: http://mcdojo-faq.tripod.com/

*

For the sake of clarity, I will use this site’s definition “A McDojo is a school that teaches a watered-down and impractical form of martial arts in the name of making money.”  To which my first response is “so”.  For fun, let’s get started by replacing “martial arts” with some other common human activities:  “A McStudio is a school that teaches a watered-down and impractical form of dance in the name of making money.” Or “A McConservatory is a school that teaches a watered-down and impractical form of music in the name of making money.” Or “A McHoopStop is a school that teaches a watered-down and impractical form of basketball in the name of making money.”  These are all clearly silly; and the simile is imperfect; and I have many more that make me laugh (I haven’t got to McRockGym and others), yet it points out the first hidden assumption:  A martial art must be “practical”.


*

So why is this wrong?  First, let us stop for talk about what is a “Martial Art”. While definitions abound and while defining something has power to set the argument, I’m going to have to give my definition.  Martial Arts are about practicing to be in violent situations. Many definitions give a sport link or an oriental link or a philosophical link but those are just recurring themes and not to the core of Martial Arts.  Violence is at the core.  Often it is uncomfortably there, but it is there nonetheless.

*


Just for a quick check:  Parkour – not, Tai Chi – is (barely), Tricking – not (but questionable), Turkish Oil Wrestling – is.  American Football – not (violence is supposed to be incidental - really).


(And, while many traditional martial arts have a spiritual aspect, I’ll go with the assumption that it is common, but not intrinsically necessary.)


*

So, must a martial art be “practical”? Not in the least. The need for an art to be practical comes from an attempt to differentiate good martial arts from bad martial arts. But, that fails because all violence is situational. From a simple shoving match, to a fight, to a brawl, to a riot, to a war, all situations have rules. These rules may be social (guys in fight with a “friend” don’t kick each other in the balls), sporting (no punches to the face), or legal (stopping after the threat is neutralized). It is impossible to take an art and remove it from its rules. Taking an eye gouging, crotch kicking set of techniques to a Taekwondo tournament is not a formula for success. Conversely, a style that is designed to score points might not be the best choice to study if you live in a gang warzone. But that doesn’t mean either style is wrong, just wrong for that situation.


*

Let us create our own martial art.  We’ll call it “Toast Fu” just for fun. This art is designed to be taught to people who work in corporate offices. As such, it has no weapons training, but has weapons disarm. It has joint locks, but no throws. Ground work is out, but chokes and standing submissions are in.  Improvising things like throwing laptops is in. Eye pokes are generally out.  Wearing clothing that restricts movement is common.  Now, great, we have a martial art. It is practical, but only in those environments. Is “Toast Fu” a good training for a bar fight situation? Probably, sort of, better than nothing. Is it good for the boxing ring? No. But that isn’t a bad thing. The art is designed to solve the problem that some people face. You can’t judge it against any other art because it is specific for some people at some time who live a certain lifestyle. This is true of all martial arts. “Practical” for one person is impractical for another.


*


The “in the name of making money” is, frankly, laughable.  Is it a business? Yes, then it is in the business of making money. How much money always depends, but all businesses need to make money. Clubs, organizations, and even monasteries need to make at least enough money to pay expenses or they cease to exist. So let’s get to really what the problem is:

“Watered Down”. Ok, so this can’t be just simplifying the curriculum or keeping techniques simple so that people can learn them faster. It must mean only one thing: Kids, those horrid pre adult creatures that infest some martial arts studios. When teaching kids, the curriculum must be structured for them. No different than if a class was structured for “seniors”. Does that mean some techniques are not taught? Yes. Is that watered down? No. It is simple ensuring that the student gets the most that they can out of the class. If a student is fat, or old, or young, or anything but a fit male 21-34, then the training is different. It isn’t watered down, it is appropriate for the situation of the student. It is, if anything, more practical, not less.


*

If you are an adult male in the prime of your fitness life, then training in the same classes where kids are being taught is not optimal. But really, how many classes are taught to kids and adults in the same way and in the same class? As you grow up, your needs to train change as does the goal of your training. That is good and natural. If you called your middles school you attended a “McSchool” that taught a watered down version of math, you would be laughed at. Same with calling any school that teaches kids martial arts. The school is teaching a martial art, it is just what is practical for a kid.  If you are an adult, you shouldn’t be taking a kids course, but really, if you need to be told this, you are probably the kind of person who insults things they don’t understand.


*

Lastly the most laughable aspect of the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Death) that surrounds the McDojo myth, “they send unprepared &amp; often over confident students into a world thinking they can fight when in actuality they have no real fighting skills”.  (From the link above). Really? This is the big crime we are fighting against? Since the pejorative “Mc” as slang from “McDonalds”, a common everyday food that the unwashed masses consume, then there must be a great number of these unprepared and overconfident students. Bullshit. The streets are not filled with people who think they can fight but they can’t. Do some kids who study martial arts think they are bigger than they are only to not be as good as they thought? Yes. Guess what, that is part of growing up. Once you hit “the real world”, many people find out they aren’t as good as they thought they were at lots of things. Being tough is just one of many things people need to reassess as they get older. This FUD is just whining about how growing up sucks. And, if you are an adult who started studying a martial art and thought you became a badass (no matter what art, no matter how “practical”, no matter what your instructor said), then you are an idiot. Sorry, you didn’t learn the lesson of growing up.


*

As you grow up, your training changes, your goals change, your situation changes, the rules change. People who complain about “McDojo’s” don’t understand that. Places for kids to train are great and wonderful and if the same place also successfully trains adults, then even better. Many teachers can connect with only kids or only adults and those that can with both are truly special. If a teacher opens a school that caters to kids and teaches lots of kids and is successful at teaching kids.  Lots of kids come, some learn more than others, some not as much. Then someone else comes by and looks down on the teacher because the kids don’t do what adults do and then tags the teacher’s school with a pejorative. If you heard that person say that, you wouldn’t think that the teacher is wrong.  You would think that the person who looked down on the teacher is wrong.  And you would be right.

I’d close with a pathetic plea about what an interweb toughguy I am for posting this and that downvoting such thinking against the hivemind is an act of cowardice, but, frankly I don’t care.  Also:

TL;DR – Sorry, I don’t have a McTLDR.

1355131424.0,31,self.martialarts,14lil1,Are you aware of the self defence laws of your country? What are they?,Hellzapoppin,35,4,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/14lil1/are_you_aware_of_the_self_defence_laws_of_your/,"As part of a martial arts seminar in sweden, we had a short lecture from a policeman that trains with us, he gave use the low-down. It got me thinking about how important it is to understand your countries laws regarding self defence, and the laws of countries you may visit. 

I'm interested in hearing your countries laws, and also what you think of the laws here in Sweden.

Here is a very simple nutshell of the laws in Sweden:

Firstly, assault is always illegal, no matter the situation. However there are circumstances that allow you to be exempt from charge:

**Self defence**: Of yourself or your property. You can also take over the self defence of another, ie you see somebody being beaten up, you can claim 'self defence' but on their behalf.  The court will only prosecute you if what you did was 'obviously excessive' (you have to be careful as a trained martial artist, as they may say you could have used less force and controlled the situation better due to your training and experience).

**Need**: A lesser claim, more related to property, ie if you are walking out in the wilderness and a buddy breaks their leg, you can break and enter a random summer house out of 'need' to shelter and await rescue (eg if a storm is approaching or there is a risk of exposure).

**Belief**: If you have good reason to believe you are in danger, you can have charges of assault dropped. This means DON'T have to wait for your would be assailant to strike first, if you see they intend to strike, or if they threaten you, you can get the first hit in and claim self defence in the belief you were in danger. Similarly, if you are being chased and hide in a public toilet, you hear the guy looking for you, the door to your cubical opens and you stick your foot straight in the face of a random stranger just wanting to relieve themselves, you will also not be prosecuted for assaulting the stranger as you as you reasonably believed it was your assailant trying to attack you. Interestingly, plain clothes police officers have to be very careful, because if they are not clearly understood to be police they can get a few smacks in the face and not be able to charge for it.

**Understandable behaviour**: Can lead to reduced or dismissed charges. For a clear and harsh example, you come home and find your kid being raped, you push the guy off and he just cowers on the floor, clearly unable to defend himself. As the situation was stopped, you can no longer claim 'self defence' for further attacks, which are now legally 'assault'. However, going nuts on this guy is 'understandable' given the circumstances, and it is likely you will incur no charges.

**Use of a weapon in self defence**: This is fine so long as it isn't 'obviously excessive'. So a guy punching you and you stabbing him 12 times is likely not going to fly. You can only have a weapon if you have a good reason to carry one, so my rattan are fine so long as I'm going to a training session, a carpenter can have a knife as part of his utility belt etc. You can't carry something that COULD be used as part of an illegal activity, so the kubotan keyrings could be quite hard to explain, especially if it is recognised by an officer at the scene. The unbreakable umbrella would likely always be fine however.

I've glossed over some of the finer details, but this gives a good idea of the way self defence is handled in Sweden. What are your thoughts?",,False,,t5_2qkt4,False,,,True,t3_14lil1,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/14lil1/are_you_aware_of_the_self_defence_laws_of_your/,

Now, I have love for MMA.  I'm a huge fan, train in some non TMA, but the base of my training is in TMA.  When people shit on Judo and Karate and other traditional martial arts, it gets under my skin.  I never hate on any MMA, but those who do MMA seem to hate on TMA on a regular basis, where is the problem?

Now I'm sure this has been discussed ad nauseum, but the last time I read a thread about this, it was TMA vs. MMA and the poster was stating the differences and why which was better, that's not what I'm looking for.

-I've trained in Aikido back home for 4 years before moving to Korea to teach English last summer. 

-In my first month I immediately started looking for a place to train in martial arts. I knew that I would be hard pressed to find an Aikido dojo in Korea (there is still a lot of animosity between Japan and Korea), but I was interested in Hapkido, a Korean martial art that shares it's lineage with Aikido.

-I found an excellent teacher, 9th degree grandmaster in Hapkido, over 40 years experience, plus extensive training in Muay Thai kickboxing, official referee for both styles, and of course Tae Kwon Do because this is Korea after all. 

-I've been training on average 4 days a week, 2 hours every night. A nice balance of both Hapkido and Muay Thai, plus sparring and weapons.

-All good so far yes? However, in the 6 months I've been here I've changed belt colors three times, from white to yellow to green to blue. This means I have only a red belt between myself and a being a certified black belt in Hapkido. At this rate I can get 1st degree in another 6 months.
I've trained hard, and I trust my instructor (despite his limited English, he's a great guy to hang out with). The gym is small and the other students are just as dedicated. The fees aren't extravagant, and he never charges for a level up.

-However I worry that  training in a foreign country has caused me to lose perspective on what I'm doing. Regardless of how many hours per week I put into training, or how experienced the instructor, is a black belt earned in a year of training somehow less legitimate?

* I want to talk about self defense too.  But, I want to talk about the part where you wanted to run away, but for whatever reason that option isnt available to you, so now you must employ martial arts of some variety.

* One of the common justifications for advising people to run is the possibility of multiple opponents.   However, to me, that seems like one of the main variables that would prevent you from escaping.  Let's talk about fighting more than one person at once.

1374867895.0,27,self.martialarts,1j4809,The Ultimate Truth About Self Defense,layzfrog,42,15,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/1j4809/the_ultimate_truth_about_self_defense/,"So, I'm sure you all read the title and are assuming a plug for krav maga or BJJ or some other style, but that is not what I am here to say. I have studied BJJ and Krav Maga myself and the one thing I took away from it was this. Some fights cannot be won. 

Sounds obvious right? Well now here is the hardest part of truly learning the reality of self defense, anyone who has truly trained knows for a fact that if five guys attacked them with weapons, they would have no chance of winning. I do not care if you think you are Ip man if five armed men corner you in a back alley you will lose if you try to fight. 

So then what do you do if you ever find yourself cornered by 5 pissed off assholes with no shot of escape? Well lets lay this out in two scenarios . First we will assume that their purpose was to rob or intimidate you not to outright kill you, since 99% of people will never find a group of five me who are committed to ending their life arbitrarily this is a safe assumption. In this scenario lets say scenario a, the men confront you and threaten to beat you up. Well krav maga would say you attack and try to escape, so you throw a hook to one and try to run. Then they grab you and knock you to the ground, and then they beat you or kill you. In this scenario you have succeeded in one thing and that is displaying yourself as a threat to them physically. Now when they attack you they are doing so with the understanding that you are dangerous, and will probably not stop beating you till you are severely injured. Now lets take a look at another option or scenario B. You realize you have no shot of escape, after offering them your money they are still there threatening and shoving you. So you lie down on the ground in fetal position covering your head and say please don't kill me. Sounds stupid right? Well here is the reality, you are more likely to survive with less injury that way. If they have already accomplished taking your money the remainder of their aggression would usually be rooted in proving a point. See in this scenario you have never displayed yourself as a physical threat. They will more likely than not be satisfied with a minor beating or perhaps none at all.

The ultimate truth about self defense is that you need to know when it is not worth fighting. If you are drastically outnumbered begging for your life and seeming weak and pitiful may save your life. The second you attack in defense you become a threat that they need to neutralize. When you fight back even a little they now can justify beating you to a bloody pulp. If you curl up and beg for mercy even the most sick twisted punks will be reluctant to beat a man curled up in a ball to death. 

This is a hard pill to swallow but if you value staying alive above all else it might be wise to consider when it is in your advantage to show not aggression. This can apply to all fields of self defense as well. In BJJ for example a common self defense stance from standing is the ""prayer stance"". The purpose of this stance is to provide adequate defense while never ""putting your fists up"". The idea is to avoid the fight at all costs and taking a defensive stance can be enough to provoke an attack. 

Sorry for the long rambling article I have just been thinking a lot about this lately and would love feedback. 


EDIT: 
So some people seem to be missing the point of what I am saying here. I am not advising you to go out and add fetal begging as a tactic, I use that as an analogy for not in any way becoming aggressive even when pushed. This sounds easy but two or three shoves and ""come on bros"" later you might feel differently. It is important to know when to know you can't win, and also important to recognized you trying to defend yourself may end up with you getting beaten to death by a guy you got a few good shots in on before his friends drag you down.


And anyone saying ""this is unrealistic"" is taking what I am saying literally and completely missing the point! ",,False,,t5_2qkt4,1375062226.0,,,True,t3_1j4809,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/1j4809/the_ultimate_truth_about_self_defense/,

1349031088.0,29,self.martialarts,10pyp6,Instinct and Conditioning,CelestialFestival,38,9,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/10pyp6/instinct_and_conditioning/,"A former Muay Thai student recently sent me an email. After about a year of training, they are questioning whether they have what it takes to really be a good martial artist. Planned training situations are alright now, but they feel in freestyle situations they're still not responding well from instinct. The following was my response.

I understand. I was an orange belt about twenty years ago when I got in my first (pause for dramatic effect) MARTIAL ARTS BATTLE!

One gentleman in my class, we'll call him Chris because that was his name, was kind of uppity. From where I'm at now, he was probably just dealing with a lot of at-home stress from his parents and reiterating cycles of dominance and verbal abuse of which he had been part, but I was young and stubborn and I had a great sense of justice: I wasn't having whatever he was saying. Being boys in the schoolyard, he decided he wanted to settle our differences in manly fashion, and took a good stance.

I was terrified. Did I mention he was in the same martial school I was, and several belts higher? My mind blanked. I couldn't remember how to block or punch, and I had no idea what to do outside of our canned combos, and he knew more than I did anyway! As stress shocked my system and I stood there trying to verbally defuse the situation, he took a quick step and fired a flying side kick at my face!

Why do we study math principles? Why do we study language structure? Surely not to analyze everything we do, but to make it a part of ourselves, so that our minds flow through well trained patterns while we go about whatever we're actually trying to accomplish. Martial arts are, in my opinion, the same. I didn't want to get kicked in the face.

So, I stepped to his dead side (he extended his left fist and foot, so I stepped to my right, effectively behind him in mid-air). I had studied strategy (homework: read Sun Tzu's Art of War) and was paying attention to the ground and environment. I had stood in front of an ice slick. As he passed, I pulled down on his pant leg slightly and he dropped right onto the ice, slipping into an uncontrolled splits and hurting himself too much to follow me as I walked away. Is this good martial arts?

As I child, I didn't think so. I was frustrated with my training. I had forgotten everything! I didn't punch or kick or burst into flame or anything cool at all! I felt scared and confused, not confident and safe like I wanted.

But now I realize that is why we train. When a rational, compassionate human being enters a conflict they truly believe is dangerous, fear and stress are natural hormonal responses. That's when you have to think strategically and depend on your conditioned body to respond as you have practiced.

Bruce Lee said (paraphrased): To the untrained, a punch is just a punch, and a kick is just a kick. As one studies combat skills, one begins to see and differentiate between style and form and technique. But when mastery has been reached, the circle completes, and a punch is just a punch again.  There is only human physical movement, and we are all built relatively the same. Components of structure and angular momentum and neuromuscular irradiation are either synchronized or disparate based on training and mindset and situational variables, but the body is a lot simpler than thousands of martial art styles may imply. Just as thousands of love letters in hundreds of languages are all trying to express similar basic needs and desires, so too are most martial styles and techniques about moving out of or into danger, projecting or accepting force, submitting to or dominating some situation. Everything else is commentary

The gift of humanity is infinite freedom, at the cost of instinct. We wire our own nervous systems through everything we do, and our habits become our instincts. You are a very young martial artist, and it is perfectly normal for your instincts to feel choppy and confused: you're still trying to program yourself, so you question everything you're doing as you do it. This is healthy biofeedback in a training environment. Improvisation is the highest iteration of performance skill, whether the field be music or theatre or martial arts. You can only riff off what you know, and you're only as confident as you've practiced to be. You will be scared about face shots until you've practiced enough to teach your nerves that it's okay; avoiding them will, by definition, increase your instinct to avoid them in the future.

It would be poor training to set yourself up for failure, so avoid picking a fight with a bouncer on 6th street for practice. You can, however, lightly tap your own face.

STAY BELOW STRESS RESPONSE.

The goal is to teach yourself, experientially, that a bump in the cheek or the mouth is okay. Tap with a single finger, and work your way up to gentle slaps. If you're not planning on being competitive there is no need to proceed further, and strong trauma to the brain case is a bad idea in general, but light taps and slaps will help you relax, over time, if you stay below stress response.

As for instinct; go SLOWER! Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Look at the angles; you know how to check a kick from both sides, how to parry and cover a punch. Practice in a mirror, practice in your mind, practice practice practice. When you have practiced DEEP enough (see The Talent Code) then your body responds to a simple thought, and you can spend less processing power doing and more planning. That's when you move from practical to tactical.

I recently had an argument with an acquaintance, and I’d like to get a wider opinion on the topic, start some interesting discussion, and possibly get some stats too. (I apologize if this has been done to death before.) Guy in question was young, kickboxing 5 years. Me: F, 7-8 years karate.

Each of the points that were brought up:

A) Men are stronger than women (average Joes.)

Me: Generally speaking, agreed. That gives average Joe an advantage over average Sally.


B) Statistically, men win more matches against women than women against men, that’s why the two don’t compete against each other in the UFC.

Me: I haven’t found any statistics stating this, it’s just a general belief. Can someone find me sources? The UFC part seems due more to people wanting to watch a violent fight, not wanting to see a *woman* get beat up, the belief that muscle mass is of paramount importance, and a forced gender divide.


C) Men’s strength is a natural boon that it’s enough to win fights, and women have nothing natural to compensate with.

Me: While strength (meaning muscle mass) is something that men gain easier, don't over exaggerate it's importance. Women are naturally more flexible, which is important to help with fluidity. A wider range of motion may allow for the opportunity to train more techniques earlier on. Women have a slightly higher percentage of muscle in their lower body than men do in their upper body. Women (and I don’t have any sources for this, myth or fact?) due to a lower body weight may have an easier time training speed than men. Women are, due to the lack of brute strength, more aware of openings and technique to be used (and therefore put more focus on training that) since there is the natural *need* to compensate.


D) Flexibility is irrelevant, since a trained male fighter will already have enough.

Me: Doesn’t this help with fluidity? And since we're talking equal training (stretching time) here, the male is going to have the same amount of flexibility that a female would have? I was under the impression that it's something guys really had to work for.


E) A woman who has done well in Amateur (such that she’s going pro) will statistically lose against males not competing at that level (just training matches), the gap between the two is that large.

Me: A female going pro = a male generally training? o.O Does that seem off to anyone else?


F) Males must often go easy on females in matches to balance out the natural gap.

Me: … there’s a natural gap? (Going “easy” on an opponent just because of their gender seems to be an insult – as if their hard work and training doesn’t make them equal and worthy of your attention.)


G) The guys saying women “aren’t that good” are just saying that to balance out the merging of tiers, since women get more credit for doing the same amount of “work” than a man would.

Me: Or their saying that to buff up their egos, and retain the Men &gt; Women mentality that they’ve become used to. =/


What do you agree and disagree with here? Any experiences you'd like to share, or sources to back stuff up with?


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My personal take, is that this is all utter hogwash.

I have a close friend who spent years in MMA. She experienced similar sexism, and had to go on a personal crusade against every member of her tournament team in order to earn their respect (and actually be let onto the team). She did cage fights and trained with a well-known UFC fighter.. and even after being let on, was still given a hard time because she was female.

During the argument between me and this guy, multiple mentions were made of a particular female who was doing so well in amateur that she was moving up to pro.. and yet, the males she came to train with at this guy’s gym (not at her level of competition, I believe) were consistently going easy on her and still winning. She just “wasn’t that good”.  I think I see a similar theme going on here..

A bunch of shots were taken at my proficiency as well (small wrist size means I couldn’t possibly have blocked anything, I’d lose against an untrained large blob because – training or no - I’m just a light female, etc.) and all of this was said with derision, which adds to my belief that much of his points really were based in stereotypes and.. well, sexism.


*Now, I’m not saying that females are better than males in martial arts.* Not at all. Only that given the same amount of training (and keep in mind, the way females fight is usually different than males), they can be on par. And that's it's kind of insulting to automatically assume your opponent, who's been working as hard as you, is inferior.

There’s still seems to be a lot of sexism in martial arts; that’s something only time and a lot open minds will change. 

But that’s just my take. Now I want yours!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**TL;DR: Women are not equal to men in martial arts says statistics, equally trained man will win against an equally trained woman, men have natural advantages that women can’t compensate for. Agree/Disagree?**

Here are some of mine:

* Riding the subway trying not to hold on to anything, balancing with a variety of stances and foot positions
* If I really need to hold on, no thumb grip like in BJJ
* Dodging tourists and pulling [Matrix moves](http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/matrix-thumb.jpg) with good footwork (you tourists who come to NYC walk way too slow and block 90% of the sidewalk :P, just sayin' )
* Opening doors with my knuckles
* Turning subway turnstiles with a hip jerk or reverse hammer fist (thumb side, haito in kyokushin?)
* Up and down on my the balls of my feet or balancing one foot while waiting for the stoplight or something
* Bathroom door at work is heavy, pull door open with arm and hip jerk and then leg sweep to keep the door open (I like to imagine putting a guy in a forward split, ouch for the inflexible)

Those are just a few of the crazy things I do.

And now, since my glutes are injured I've replaced anything with the legs with hip hinging to retrain my body to activate them properly.

(...) The popular notion of black clothing is likely rooted in artistic convention. Early drawings of ninja were shown to be dressed in black in order to portray a sense of invisibility. This convention was an idea borrowed from the puppet handlers of bunraku theater, who dressed in total black in an effort to simulate props moving independently of their controls. (...)*

*The historicity of armor specifically made for ninja cannot be ascertained. While pieces of light armor purportedly worn by ninja exist and date to the right time (...) There were light weight concealable types of armour made with kusari (chain armour) and small armor plates such as karuta that could have been worn by ninja including katabira (jackets) made with armour hidden between layers of cloth. Shin and arm guards, along with metal-reinforced hoods are also speculated to make up the ninja's armor.""*

I was working with my senior student on some insert drills when, at a break, he mentioned that he wished we'd had a chance to drill with a new knife blank I'd picked up.  I tossed the blank to him, picked up a kris blank for myself, and we went back to the drill.

Now, if I'd been thinking I'd have also grabbed the two sets of goggles from my gear bag, but then I wouldn't have a story to tell, now would I?

So the drill was going quite smoothly for a few minutes, but right in the middle of one pass I felt a blinding (literally) pain in my right eye and pressure where no pressure is ever supposed to be.  I shouted (I may have been a *bit* vulgar), grabbed my eye and dropped.

I spent the next few minutes verifying that, yes, I could still see.  That, no, my contact was not still lodged in some far corner of my eye.  That, yes, my eyes dilated and tracked the same still.  And other basic first aid.

This morning I had a doctor check me out (eye injuries are nothing to mess with) and he said it appears the impact was mainly on my eyelid and not on the eye itself.  Outside of some soreness, increased eye fatigue for a couple days, and a small scratch on the white of my eye, I'm currently alright.  Though I will have to make sure there's no diminishing of vision, increase in pressure, or other warning symptoms for a day or so.

One day he covers for my master and begins the class by whipping out some rusty ass knife from under his uniform.  He tells us that some Vietnamese guy sold it to him and it was poisoned.  Someone asked what poison.  Apparently the Vietnamese during the Vietnam War had a tradition of poisoning their knives by pissing and shitting on their knives when they were out in the jungle.  So even the smallest cut would give you tetanus and crazy shit poison.

And then we begin to do knife drills with this thing.  We all thought it was cool.  Luckily this guy restrained himself instead of stabbing us with the rubber knives like he usually does.

The second part of the lesson was learning what it felt like to be knocked out.  We did this one at a time.  The victim would sit cross-legged on the floor against the wall and breathe shallow and quickly for 30 seconds.  The victim was then instructed to stand up quickly and then he proceeded to wrap his hands around around the victim's neck and choke them.  I saw my friend drop like a fly (caught by the crazy black belt) and then spasm on the floor.  The black belt then said something about knowing which vertebrae to hit, which would send a shock to the brain and wake you up again.  He sat my friend up and pounded somewhere in his lumbar area with his palm.  And then my friend woke up.  He said he felt like he slept for hours.

Then it was my turn, and I thought I was asleep for hours as well.  Most peaceful sleep I've ever gotten.  Scary as shit.

**tl;dr**
Crazy black belt subbed for class, did live drills with a tetanus, shit, and piss covered Vietnamese poison dagger and then he proceeded to gently knock us out with a choke and then wake us up again with a hit to some vertebrae that apparently sends a shock to your brain.

**still tl;dr**
I almost fucking died.

Originally belts where a western influence, and even after they were introduced they were monitored strictly. a black belt was not even supposed to awarded to someone if they weren't at least 16 years old. in Japan a person was not granted the rank of expert or master until they were an adult. so why has the whole belt system or ranking system gone to such chaos?

black belts are given to children, and people who can hardly conduct the simplest techniques are granted expert ranks! it is no wonder that the martial arts in general gets mocked and made fun of. 

why is there so much emphasis given to the belt system if it really technically doesn't even mean anything? you would think at least that if such a system was important that it would be unified across the board. all schools would recognize that if a person had a black belt, or a rank of advanced expert or some kind, that it would mean that they could conduct themselves accordingly. 

I don't know, I just felt like ranting because I had the unfortunate experience of meeting a couple young teens at another school in my area that couldn't hardly fight to save their lives, let alone win a single sparring match, and they were all BB and 2 dans! WTH!!

if things could be changed, would you eliminate belts all together, or strictly monitor and only allow ranks to those actually deserving?

 what's your opinion?

So the general consensus seems to be saying palm strikes for the head, and normal punches for below the shoulders (hard to soft, soft to hard). 

The clinch is a good idea too.

Let me give you my background: I have been in two scuffles in my times. One before I knew martial arts, and one since I started training. Both of them were unprovoked, and both situations happened so fast that I had absolutely no time to place my hand in the correct position(s) to effectively use a joint lock. This is my own personal experience. I do not see these moves working on the street.

Kali has drills similar to Wing Chun, but without the ""sticky-hands"" concept where you always have your hands/arms in contact with your opponents. The drills in Kali are based off attacks from certain angles (12 angles), so that, once memorized, all attacks can be countered using relatively the same techniques, removing the need to memorize a gazillion techniques.

Also, because of the ""angle"" concepts, they also attack using these 12 angles. Because of that, their practice with sticks (their main weapon) can be easily interpreted to weapon-less combat. Stick strikes are turned into hand strikes by simply dropping the weapon. Any stick-like weapons will do also, like pens, rolled up newspapers, a ruler, a chopstick, etc. The movements are all the same with or without weapons. There's no different ""style"" to your attack, like in most Chinese martial arts, where, once a weapon is used, their style changes. This makes Kali much simpler to do in terms of muscle memory. 

This style has locks, throws, disarms, grappling, strikes, kicks, and weapons all intertwined in its combat system. 

What are your opinions on this martial art?

Please, don't reference martial arts from movies, as, a lot of those are made to appeal to the audience using fast/useless movements. I'm not saying ALL movies have this, but I would say most martial arts movies change the martial art to appeal more to the audience.

Oh and in case you're wondering where Kali might have been in the media, watch The Book of Eli or all four of the Bourne movies. The martial arts they use there is Kali, as taught by Jeff Imada. This martial art is also taught all over the world to many military and police organizations.

Here's a sample of the martial art: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYDWCE_oZRo&amp;list=PLDQsx9DNWK5QVl8qGOPcWf9x8ACdJqwOX

What do you guys think?,robo555,28,5,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/udts4/realised_what_it_means_to_relax_to_throw_stronger/,"I've previously studied Muay Thai, and currently studying Wing Chun. In both cases, a problem I have is I don't feel I punch very hard or fast. i.e. good people the same size as me can punch a lot harder.

As you probably all heard, instructors tell us to ""relax"", don't tense the muscles when punching, etc. What does this mean? I never managed to achieve this, until I realised:

**It's all about pinning the shoulder.** Watch this entire video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGDDAng-UHU&amp;feature=plcp

In Muay Thai, the #1 rule is to keep the hands up at eye brow height to protect the head, so that's what I've been doing all these years. In the infamous Michael Jai White and Kimbo video, at 1:56, it quite clearly illustrates what I've been doing with my arms:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdPP0TmqKiU

If you watch the whole video, you can clearly see at 1:56 his stance is a lot different. His shoulders are lifted, and moves with the arms.

When my Muay Thai instructor spars, at the beginning he always closes his eyes for a moment and when he re-opens them, he looks a lot more relax, but I never figured out what he did differently. I now think he took a breath out, and pinned the shoulders. 

With my hands at guard position, my biceps are tense when my shoulders are up, when the shoulders are pinned, my biceps are soft and squashy.

One big difference between Muay Thai and Wing Chun is when practising, Muay Thai always keep hands at eye brow height, while in Wing Chun hand is at chest/belly height, which I always felt vulnerable because it goes against Muay Thai's idea of protecting the head.

Now that I know how to pin my shoulder, I realise I can still keep my guard at eye brow height without lifting my shoulder. So this technique works for both arts. It also explains why I've been getting sore shoulders when practising slow gentle chain punching in Wing Chun, because I've been keeping my shoulders up.

So, this is a revelation for me, what do you guys think, am I on the right path? I've going to try it next week and see if my techniques improve.

Basically they are taught only the most basic stuff, Judo, some Jujitsu and maybe boxing if they showed any aptitude, even special forces don't get much more. It's purpose was not really to teach close combat, more to train controlled aggression. 

He said it was down to two real reasons, one was guns are so much more effective and reliable at killing that close combat shouldn't really ever happen, and two was that the psychological impact of killing up close was so much greater than at range it caused lasting mental problems. Ranged combat you can almost put out of your mind after it's happened. 

I believe the original discussion centred around the difference between police and the army. Police in the UK can't rely on guns to bring someone in, so have to learn suppression techniques, much more complicated than the military ever need, they don't have to worry about keeping the people they are immediately fighting alive, it's much simpler. 

So there you go. That's the jist of a much longer conversation.

The master-disciple relationship, while many may not like it, is very important in my opinion. While I like the modern development of 'proving your skill', I feel that the focus on fighting can be detrimental to the more important goals. Many forget that the ultimate goal of life is happiness and the increase of one's quality of life, and for countless of people, going to self-defense seminars or solely practicing MMA is not directly helping them achieve those goals. It's a good hobby, but it's not facing the problems of the individual. They need other things next to their martial arts to help them through life. The master-disciple relationship on the other hand is directly involved with solving the problems that stand in the way of the individual's happiness. Yes I am talking about 'spiritual' development, although I don't like to use this word. It sounds too esoteric. It should be called 'learning how to deal with life in practical ways'. A good master is more than just a guide in fighting, he should be a practical guide of life itself. And because he (or she) is both, the relationship grows into something more than just a therapeutic relationship. This is called the master-disciple relationship.

Most modern martial arts don't cover this aspect because it's too difficult and time-consuming for a trainer to talk about a practitioner's personal issues. It's not his goal, he's not trained to be a personal guide and most will not be interested in this. So when you go to the gym, you can't thoroughly talk about your problems or solve them. You train and become better at fighting, that is the goal. That's the big difference with traditional schools, where you can sit down with the master or teacher and talk about your life while sipping tea. These people have been 'trained' to be guides. They can give you advice and guidance or even help you by giving you personal mental/spiritual/physical/social exercises. And it's all happening within the school, which can be a therapeutic environment in itself. It's a lot like a Buddhist school in a way. You have the Buddha (master), Dharma (teaching, martial arts curriculum), and Sangha (fellow practitioners). 

Another thing is culture. Chinese culture in my case. Just doing a lion-dance may seem ridiculous or even a waste of time for many modern martial artists. But look at the training of lion dance! It's very hard training. And look at the benefits it brings to the group! Look at the social bonds it creates within the school. The school makes money, new equipment gets bought and everybody helped in achieving this, so there is a real experience of growth and sense of achievement. It makes the school grow more tightly together. It's not solely about personal development anymore, it's about developing all of the people within the school as a group. It's much like a family.

But this is the kind of thing nobody wants or cares to talk about because it's not important now. All that matters is 'if your style is effective on the street' and your individual physical progress with the martial art. I agree that that is important to test your style (within the boundaries of realistic testing) but still, the other sides should be considered if you want a more holistic form of martial arts. And wanting MORE out of martial arts than just 'effectiveness' is a blessing and it should be cherished. I wish more people would see the benefits of traditional values but sadly the bad parts get magnified and the good parts are neglected.",,False,,t5_2qkt4,False,,,True,t3_moe1e,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/moe1e/why_masterdisciple_relationships_and_traditions/,

I joined when I was 13, quit when I was 15 and I reached brown belt, two belts away from Black. I'll be writing notes on the FAQ's ""warning signs"" and ""red flags""
**Edit** I realise that the FAQ I based this on has subjective criteria and that just because my experiences were similar to those listed that I wasn't 100% ""McDojo'd"". The words I want to emphasize are ""**I think**"" and ""**to a degree**""

* Kid black belts: the younger the black belt, the worse the school is.

I was in the Juniors group, so black belts ranged between 17 to 8. One particular boy who was well below the age of 13 was a brown belt and was always very sloppy.

* Belt Factory: If students are promoted quickly, such as reaching a new rank every two months, and/or reaching black belt in less than 3 years. Skill is usually superseded by the ability to pay for testing fees.

Grading was held every 3 months, with 12 belts to achieve. At one point I was double graded from 8th Kyu to 6th. 

* Point sparring: If the ONLY sparring that is done is ""point"" or ""tournament"" sparring, or is watered down with numerous rules such as no contact or light contact, no punching to the head, no catching, trips, throws, take downs, joint locks, grappling, hits to the back, legs, below the belt, etc… and the techniques encouraged are kicks, jump kicks, and spins.

No head contact, very light contact, all kicks were encouraged, sweeps were allowed, but all together it seemed to be I strike, you block, you strike I block.

* If the idea of take-downs or wrestling is never addressed, or if ""anti-grappling"" techniques are taught. 

I only remember two basic sweeps which appeared in 2 separate sessions and were never mentioned again. Also, the subject of 'ground fighting' was never covered. 
**Edit** I suppose I think of different schools being a bit homogeneous and since we didn't do groundwork, my mind saw it as a red flag. 

* If the test for belt advancement consists mostly or entirely of memorization and making your form &amp; one-steps look pretty 

This was how they graded us until we reached higher ranks where sparring was introduced, then even higher they added ""free style"" where we just walked from one side of the room to the other performing striking techniques 

* If the self-defense techniques that are taught aren't at full speed or contact, or if the school is insistent only on one way of doing it 

Self-defence techniques were taught far and few between, some were full contact but they weren't full-speed. They had 2 lessons per week (I only attended 1 because it costed too much) and the main instructor was juggling other things such as kickboxing and a Scouts group. I say this in case it may have an affect on the lessons

* If the school has many students, such as over 100, or if there are many black belts

The organization has schools set up around and outside my town, so in total, yes. They had over (or just about under) 100 students 

The group was the [East Coast Karate Black Belt School](http://www.blackbeltpower.co.uk/karate.aspx).

This subreddit has seemed to be working well under the newly codified set of rules which were put out a couple of weeks ago with one exception.

    

It has been brought to my attention that the idea behind one of the rules which I had posted was misconstrued as well as appearing to be a personal attack against some people on this subreddit which was not intended.

The rule in question was: 

&gt;If you're needlessly putting down others martial art =&gt; REMOVED (Some of our regulars should pay attention to this, Theres a fine line between debate and abuse)

This has generated some controversy over the word **needlessly** so I thought I would explain my reasoning and suggest a rewording which has been suggested by /u/TopTomCat.

Needlessly in this case doesn't refer to the TMA/MMA argument, or expressing the general feeling that someone isnt' studying a *valid* art. It is the purposely disrespectful/insulting/trolling remarks which are occasionally made on this subreddit by individuals against other peoples martial art study. 
People who study Tae Kwon Do or Ninjitsu are regularly targets of this sort of abuse. Normally these comments aren't seen by all participants since they are heavily downvoted by the community. After such scenes the participants are warned and the offending comments removed. Several people who semi-regularly posted on this subreddit have been removed for abuse after receiving numerous warnings about abusive behaviour.

A new wording of these rules have been made which will be subject to community approval and then the offending rule in the Rules section will be changed.


&gt; Insulting, offensive or foul-mouthed remarks about a martial art or individual with no attempt at constructive remarks =&gt; REMOVED.

This means that:

* I believe TKD is a lesser art as it doesn't incorporate live full-contact sparring.

* Kata are not useful in a current martial arts environment unless they are incorporated into a usable form where each move is understood.


are acceptable, however:

* Ninjitsu is a shitty art because everyone who does it is fat and gay

is not.

If anyone has any comments or other feeling about this rule change please suggest alternatives, if this is accepted by the majority the /Rules section will be updated

I went for one BJJ trial class at an MMA gym and ended up replacing one of my weekly Wing Tzun training days with a BJJ day.  So now it is one day of each per week.  I've been at BJJ for about 3 months now so still very n00b.  I thought this time I would address what I view as a common debate theme in this subreddit.  **Keep in mind, all of this is completely my opinion, entirely anecdotal, and I dont feel I am qualified in either art to speak with any authority.**  

*TMA or combat sport?*  I think I like the Erik Paulson stance that each augments the other.  If you are doing BJJ, I think the close quarter strikes of WT can really put some teeth in your grappling.  Likewise, learning to very effectively control someones body coupled with great takedown defense will make your WT absolutely brutal.  

I think there was an intensity level that needed to be addressed in my WT.  But, I do think that brutal techniques are effective.  The argument is often that you cannot practice brutal techniques at full resistance, so you dont know that you can deliver them when it counts.  There is some truth to that.  More so, I think brutal techniques are granted more stopping power than they would actually deliver in real life by the TMA community.  

However, if you learn to control someone's body, the way you do in grappling, at fully resisting intensity, then all of a sudden those brutal techniques you learned in WT are completely available to you.  And, by having no fear of a ground battle, you can be that much more aggressive in a stand up fight, a la the Diaz Brothers.  

Just my thoughts.  

Oh and one dig at my WT brothers: how is a choke not a deadly technique?  BJJ is just as 'deadly' as WT.  :P

I want to hear some of those thoughts.  I came up with some guiding questions just to get things started, feel free to use or ignore them.  I'm sure we're going to get some flame wars in here anyway :P

1) What has your teacher said about forms.  Why are you using them to train?
2) Do you find them useful in any way?
3) Beside what your teacher has said about them, what is your view on forms?


I train in a traditional style so we have forms.  They're a part of testing, they're a part of our heritage.  My master teaches us forms with that in mind, but does not pretend that forms are appropriate for real life applications.  Some movements are inefficient.  Some of them aren't realistic.  Everything we train including our joint-locks are cleaned up for realism.  Of course, this inclination will differ from master to master.  I'm just lucky.  Also I try to be smart about things.  The deep stances ain't going to help you out in a bar fight.  However, they are again a part of our heritage and considered artistic to a varying extent.  I appreciate that.

While extremely unrealistic with their deep stances and rigid movements, forms do build up muscle memory, familiarize you with some forms of footwork, and helps you chain techniques together.  I look at like lifting weights.  I try to get into perfect stance, use the exact amount of muscle tensions and timing (hard and soft style, it's extremely important to be rigid only at the moment of striking), breathing, mental focus, and overall execution.  All these things combined, it becomes beautiful to perform and watch.  Meditative.  Here's an example of my master demonstrating at a tournament: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS6zQBmw3n4

In our tournaments there are forms and there is sparring.  So being half of what you bring to a tournament, forms are pretty important in demonstrating what you've learned since last time.  We're family oriented so showing off like this is enjoyable.  Sparring is a different story that I won't get into--I go to an MMA gym for that stuff.

TL;DR
My master treats forms as a part of our heritage and not something to fight with.  I use forms like I use weights.  They condition a few very specific things.  Doing them to perfection in itself can become something beautiful worthy of applaud.  For fighting, I go to an MMA gym.

EDIT: Word, seems like we're on the front page :P  Glad to see everyone is more or less on the same page with forms.  So long as you know that it's not realistic and treat it as such, I think we all benefit from them.",,False,,t5_2qkt4,True,,,True,t3_mko6n,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/mko6n/formskata_whats_your_take/,

Feel free to answer the question the way you want. This goes far beyond the reasons you picked up your favourite martial art. Why did you take up martial arts? Why do keep up practising a martial art?

I've been interested in martial arts since I was a kid, but I was never exposed to them (my parents never took me to a gym or a dojo). On december 2011, my family and me moved near downtown. We were dining and, I don't remember why, somehow the martial art topic was brought up. My brother mentioned there was a gym next door, we decided to take up something. We asked what they taught, and we took up BJJ. It was by chance, but after a year or so I like BJJ very much.

Why do I train for? I don't compete, I don't like tournaments and I don't believe very much on self defense (most of the attacks on street involves firearms over here)... Anyway, I see it as a path of self improvement; I wasn't born with great physical skills and I'm very clumsy, I never was a sportive guy, I work full time and study, so it's hard for me to train and improve... it's very challenging, but it's highly rewarding...

Additionally, I met very nice people in the gym... Others practitioners are very supportive, and we've got two instructors... One of them is a handicapped guy who used to train judo and bjj; after getting some weird illness, he can't move his legs... he sits on the tatami and teaches us newaza and tachiwaza... he never misses a class, even when he can't get to the gym by himself (he must be accompanied by his mother, his brother or the other instructor)... that's very inspiring, and this certainly makes me keep up with the training... if I'm exhausted, my body hurts, it downpours or I'm just in no mood for training, I just need to remember that my sensei is making a way bigger effort than me to assist the class...",,False,,t5_2qkt4,False,,,True,t3_1hkjx7,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/1hkjx7/what_do_you_fight_for/,

One of these techniques is the Fireman's Carry.  A standard wrestling throw with many variations, it was later co-opted into Judo as Kata Guruma (shoulder wheel) when Kano found the move in a book on western wrestling.  As the name implies it is also one way that fire fighters can carry a wounded or deceased person, and is also widely taught to people in other emergency services and the military.

1348120383.0,21,self.martialarts,106hn3,In (Cautious) Defense of the Contract,osian19,26,5,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/106hn3/in_cautious_defense_of_the_contract/,"Let me preface:  I am a martial artist with 16 years of practice within the same style of kung fu.  I have been through every inch of martial arts programs:  kids classes, private classes, adult classes, instructor certifications, competitions, to opening my own school to success.  Martial arts is my life, you could say.

Now, I've seen here and everywhere else that people are wary of contracts.  Understandably so.  With the same bittersweet taste of high-pressure gym memberships, McDojos right and left have adopted contracts as a way to con students into paying exorbitant sums of money for mediocre instruction.  I would be worried about 6 months too, if I weren't sure of the level of instruction offered.

However, a few things need to be put into perspective.  The purpose of a contract is neutral, initially.  Asking for commitment from a student is as old as the hills themselves, but usually it wasn't for six months, or a year.  It was until the end.  Whatever end.  Didn't like that?  You didn't learn.  Commitment allows the instructor to take your request to learn seriously.  Remember, the old way of learning was the students sought out the teacher, hoped to become a pupil.  Not the other way around.  Commitment gives the instructor time to teach you well, not just try to cram a few basics down your throat before the end of the month.  

It's when that asking for commitment is not followed with legitimate instruction that problems occur.  As an instructor, I'll give students up to a month to try out the group class as well as other types of introductory programs to allow the student to effectively see how I teach and what they think.  If we are a good match, we proceed.  If we are not, then we move on.  Teaching a fifteen minute lesson and then asking for a $200 down payment and a 6 month contract is irresponsible on the part of the instructor.  You are supposed to be forming a relationship with the student.  You cannot know the student in 15 minutes.  

However, contracts do provide the instructor with the security that you will try and see things out.  The old idea is to trust in the tao, or way.  Teachers should have enough foresight to know exactly what students need and how to teach them.  Maybe you love kicking and punching, but you hate forms/kata.  A good instructor knows the value of everything they teach and will know how those forms will benefit you in the long run.  Month-to-month students might be more willing to leave when forms are introduced because they don't find value in them.  Contractual students are required to learn them regardless, and later they realize the acquired benefit.  

As a teacher, I am planning out how to teach things to my students up to a year in advance.  Example:  by next September you should be learning basic tripping principles, so I'm going to start preparing your legs and bodies in this manner, so that by next September, you already can handle the shift in intensity.  And so on.  If you're going to be gone next month, that makes my careful planning worthless, effectively wasting both of our time.  Contracts show that it's not useless for me to take that time and consideration for the student.  I don't have to worry about the short term instant gratification, and I can start preparing long term.  

It also provides me with a steady stream of income.  Let's face it, most people learn martial arts in commercial settings.  Commercial settings have certain financial requirements (e.g. rent, utilities, advertising needs, the cost of living for the instructor).  Those financial requirements are paid for in majority by students' tuition.  If I'm uncertain the income I'm going to be receiving for the school next month, I'm more stressed and my attitude toward the school, students, and the whole institution is going to be affected.  That's just human nature.  

I never worried about letting students try out class for a month first because I know my teaching is good enough for them to want to continue.  Perhaps this is why most McDojos don't like such lengthy trial periods.  They are going to be found out sooner or later.  But later I do get most of my students on six-month to year-long contracts.  In my eyes, it shows that the students care for me, too.  It is a mutual respect sort of thing.  

Just something I wanted to put out into the world, and perhaps gain a little feedback.  ",,False,,t5_2qkt4,False,,,True,t3_106hn3,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/106hn3/in_cautious_defense_of_the_contract/,

This is basically a fight between two students with referees and a point system. The intensity is high and you can be hurt if you aren't careful.

During this competition, we circulated between students so we all got to fight each other. It was fun and there was no malice, but at the time I felt fearful and quite overcome with emotion to the point where I was fighting off tears and trembling with a croaky voice trying not to whimper.

Now, I have no reason to be afraid or upset because I trust everyone at the Dojo, however the intensity of this style of training, which I don't do enough of I will admit, seemed to cut right through any notion of my fighting spirit.

I feel quite gutted now, like I am completely inadequate to use the things I have learned when I need them. However I am not beat and I realize that this is something I need to address if I want to be a capable fighter.

Our Sensei told us after the class that he believes there is a thing he calls 'mongrel', which is basically the innate ability to thrive under high stress like being punched and kicked from all angles. He said that few people possess it, but it can be imitated with the correct training.

So that is my story, and here is my question:

How have you imitated 'mongrel'? If you possess this rare trait then what is your state of mind when fighting? If you are used to tournament fighting, or more so real fights then how to you keep yourself from breaking down? How do you cope with being overcome with attacks?

I appreciate any knowledge that you can share with me and other redditors here, anything you may know will be useful to us.


Edit:

We had another hard-sparring class last night and thanks to all of your advice I was able to keep a calm and controlled state. I even managed to score a point!

I practice TKD, one practices BJJ, and another does what he claims to be Muay Thai, but I've never seen him do anything so I can't be sure.

We were discussing strategies and throwing hypothetical situations at each other when I offhandedly mentioned that I wouldn't do what BJJ buddy did because my code wouldn't allow it.  They just kind of stared at me and asked what the hell I was talking about.

The short version of my CoH is that I don't sucker punch, I don't fight just for the sake of fighting, and I don't (this is what got me grilled) strike people when they're on the ground.

The two of them pretty much said they follow no such code, and their schools don't suggest one either.  I'm kind of wondering if I'm just extremely old fashioned, or if they're just savages.

*Side note:  There are instances where I will fight on the ground.  I strongly prefer not to, but if that's pretty much the only way I'm walking away from the fight, so be it.  But that's not the point of this discussion.*

1311960457.0,23,self.martialarts,j3dwn,A run-down of most martial arts,pointman_joey,25,2,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/j3dwn/a_rundown_of_most_martial_arts/,"This is intended to give a VERY brief description of most of the MAs that have subreddits here, to help with people deciding what MA they want to do. I've written more on the MAs with larger subreddits, as I figure that's what more people are interested in. I hope this will help someone decide what Martial Art they wish to train in, as it is often difficult to find a centralized list and compare. Remember that whatever kind of art you want to do ( e.g. for self defence, weaponry, or fitness) is only worth learning with a good instructor.





**Brazilian Jiu Jitsu**: Adapted from Japanese Judo, BJJ focuses on getting opponents on the ground and using chokes and joint locks to defeat them. The idea is getting an opponent on the ground will take away advantages such as longer reach or better standup fighting techniques. Sparring is common in training.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Jiu-Jitsu                                                                                                                                                              



**Judo**: A Japanese art focused on throwing and grappling. Also has ""katas"", patterns of techniques that are practiced with partners. An old and traditional martial art, with almost no striking.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo


**Mixed Martial Arts**: A modern fighting style focused on sportive competition. A mixture of BJJ, Judo, Boxing, Muay Thai, Wrestling and various others. Focuses on standing and ground fighting through holds, grapples, throws and strikes. A balanced MA, where previous experience in others may help. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts


**Muay Thai (Thai Kickboxing)**: Focused on effective striking, it is very popular with MMA fighters. Also taught is striking from clinches. Ground fighting is not typically taught. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay_thai



**Ju-Jutsu**: A Japanese art, the predecessor to Judo, focused on grappling and fighting armed opponents. Use of weapons is sometimes taught. More focus on standing fighting than BJJ. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ju_jutsu



**Boxing**: Focused solely on punching. No kicks, grapples, disarms or weapon use taught. Not *the* most effective for street fighting, but you will develop extremely strong punching technique. Minimal clinching is practiced, though mostly to get a rest or recovery period when sorely pressed by the opponent. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing



**Aikido**: Aikido comes from the same lineage as judo and jujitsu; a Japanese art focused on defence and grappling. This art is taught to the Japanese riot police, who are praised for their restraint and rarely harming civilians.  It emphasizes good body movement, throws, joint locks, and pins. Although many techniques include softening strikes, the goal of aikido techniques is to neutralize aggression swiftly without undue harm to the attacker. Aikido also includes strikes and disarms with wooden weapons: sword, staff, and knife. Free sparring is rare. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido



**Wing Chun**: A Chinese MA that teaches striking and trapping. Focuses strongly on the idea of the ""centerline"" not found in many other MAs, where an imaginary line is drawn from the chest of the practitioner to the opponent, with the theory that the most effective strikes will go down this line to the eyes/nose/groin etc. Punches are very popular in this MA. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chun



**Parkour**: The art of moving across any obstacle in your path. Involves vaulting fences, climbing walls, jumping gaps, etc. Originated in France. Many, many videos of it are on youtube. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour



**Jeet Kune Do**: Hybrid MA founded by Bruce Lee. No specific focus, and its technical syllabus is much less rigid compared to other fighting styles. A large part of it is ""economy of motion"", or how to have maximum effect with minimum movement. Also has the centerline of Wing Chun. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeet_Kune_Do



**Krav Maga**: An Israeli fighting style, with complete focus on self defence, not sport. Used by military forces, paramilitary units, and police departments around the world. Focus is on preemptive attacks, disarms, and avoiding groundfighting, as well as fighting more than one attacker. Comes in 3 different types: Civilian, Law Enforcement/Security, and Military. An especially brutal fighting system compared to most other MAs. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga


**Eskrima/Arnis/Kali**: Filippino arts focused on stick and knife fighting, with a lesser focus on unarmed combat. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskrima

**Kendo**: Japanese MA focused on swordplay. Does not teach unarmed combat. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendo

**Taekwondo**: Korean MA, said to be the most popular MA in the world. Very strong focus on kicking and striking. Sparring is common in training. Taught in two branches: WTF (sporting) and ITF (traditional). ITF is more geared towards self defence, and has equal emphasis on hand and foot, whereas WTF strikes are almost exclusively kicks. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo

**Tai Ji Quan**: Chinese martial art often taught as a method of low-impact exercise and meditation rather than a fighting method. When taught martially, it focuses on relaxed body mechanics and standing grappling. See also Internal Arts. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Ji_Quan

**Iaido**: Japanese MA focused on sword drawing with a katana. Does not teach unarmed combat. Teaches almost exclusively through katas. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iaido

**Kickboxing**: Strong focus on striking, with kicks (as you'd expect), but also punches. Kickboxing arts have been independently invented in Thailand, Japan and America. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickboxing

**Internal Arts**: Chinese Taoist MAs that focus on the psychological and spiritual elements of Martial Arts, as well as relaxed body mechanics. The big three internal arts are tai chi, ba gua and hsing i. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_martial_arts

**Bajiquan**: Chinese MA focused on striking. More focused on close combat rather than longer ranges. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C4%81j%C3%ADqu%C3%A1n

**Silat**: A collective term for Malaysian MAs. Lots of different styles that teach striking, throws, grappling, weaponry or a mixture of them. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silat

**Shorinji Kempo**: A Japanese MA influenced by Chinese fighting styles. Has a component of discipline and training in zen. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorinji_kempo

**Bujinkan**: A fairly modern Japanese MA which claims to incorporate techniques from ninjutsu. More based on self defence than sport. No specific focus as striking, grappling, throws, weaponry, etc. are all taught. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bujinkan

**Kyokushin**: A form of full contact Karate. Emphasis on realistic combat and physical toughness. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyokushin

**Karate**: Originated from the island of Okinawa. Focus on striking. Many different types of Karate, too many to list here. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate

**Kung Fu**: Umbrella term for most Chinese MAs. Like Karate, there are many different types. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_fu

**Western Martial Arts**:  Umbrella term for MAs that begun in the West, not the East. Examples include savate, fencing, wrestling and boxing. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_martial_arts

**Capoeira**: A dancelike Brazilian MA, focused on striking, as well as avoiding, rather than blocking attacks. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira

**Hung Gar (Hung Quan)**: A Chinese martial arts originated from Shaolin Kungfu. It focuses primarily on external striking with movement mimicking fighting animals (tiger, crane, snake, leopard, dragon) as the basics. The style was popularized by the Chinese folk hero Wong Fei Hung and his student Lam Sai Wing who had been featured in numerous movies. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_Gar

With MMA, the ring and the street are our 2 sources for knowing what works and what doesn't. But unlike weight lifting regimens, where scientific studies have shown which way is faster/better for building muscle, martial arts doesn't always have large sample sizes, representative sample populations, and realistic constraints in the situations we're looking at to draw conclusions from.

Sometimes I see some back and forth on here where a study (were it to exist) would settle the debate once and for all. Anyone have any questions they'd love science to tackle? In some cases, it may be impractical to run the experiment even if the money was available, but imagine anything's possible.

For me, it would be (some of these would be challenging to design experiments for, and others would be unethical):

1. Optimal angle and strike type for knockout blows to the head. Requisite power and speed levels for such a strike.
2. Effects of knuckle conditioning on punching power and penetration (if any).
3. Whether and which knife defense techniques really work against simulated, semi-randomly generated knife attacks.

So, I always just used a mouth guard, but had an incident a year back with some hot-head and a huge right cross that end up costing a lot of money.

And specifically, what drills or exercises do you do to improve your muscle memory for certain techniques or improve speed/strength of the techniques (whatever they be)?

* bag work 
* throwing drills using elastic bands around a pole/door knob
* hip shift drills (to improve control/transitions whilst ground fighting)
* Planks with knee strikes
* etc etc

Everyone knows the story from the early days of the UFC, the Gracies pounded everyone, striking had its weaknesses shown off and 'Fighting Changed Forever!' became the call in many sectors of the martial world. The reactions were varied, but frankly can be boiled down into three core arguments:

1) 'My Striking art alone is not enough, I need to cross-train'

2) 'Their techniques are designed for the ring, mine are designed for combat, I do no need to cross-train because the circumstances under which I'm fighting are different than that of a structured tournament.'

3) 'Grappling is best, Long Live Grappling.'

   Now, you can debate the merits of those views endlessly, and often times on here, we do. The important thing is not the arguments themselves, but the changes that they wrought on the greater culture of Martial training, namely the fact that something was expected of each and every Art now, that being a reaction to the new data that had been borne from those early fights. It's inescapable, every one of them had to either rationalize why they were still effective, or prove it by becoming increasingly competitive in scope. More than anything else, I think it caused people to question Martial Arts more, and I think that because of the UFC, and the blow-back that has resulted from some sectors of the TMA world, we are living in a renaissance of competitive martial arts. 

   What i'm curious about is the effect that this will have on students both present and future? Does it mean that they are generally harder to fool?

The other post in question was for the [Crazy Street Fighter Challenges Muay Thai Instructor](http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/1ekjv2/crazy_street_fighter_challenges_muay_thai/)

The tone between the comments in these two threads is a lot different.  Are they the same thing?  Is there a double standard?  Were these instructors justified in their actions?  

Do you feel that you or your instructor would or have they already accepted challenges to prove the efficacy of your art to people off the street?  If so would there be rules and protective gear.  Would either person be allowed to tap or quit?  How far would you take it?

If you suspected that the person was mentally handicapped or on drugs would that change your opinion?

I watched this other video that was posted by TallCoolOne88 and was just appalled at the outcome.  I would say this is NSFW due to the brutality in the end.  [RAW: Mentally Challenged Man Beaten to Death by MMA Fighter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsPmHZjK_ZA)

I am tired of being messed with so I want to learn some sort of martial art that will help me deal with some of the kids at my high school.

I'll be sure to take into account the extremely helpful advice you guys have offered.

Essentially, she finds this out. She proceeds to tell everyone who's expressed an interest that I'm not qualified to teach, and now publicly embarrasses me about it whenever the topic of martial arts comes up.

So, my friends, how do I convince her I am indeed qualified to teach my peers self-defense without ruining our relationship? She feels that even though we practice wildly different martial arts, her couple extra years in the mat room allows her to assume my proficiency in Krav. Her adherence to ""tradition"" has been an excuse to not come to one of my classes despite my invitations, so that's off the table. 

With any normal person this would be cake, but we're truly good friends and she's very adamant in her assumptions. I don't want us to drift apart over something so silly.

It doesn't happen, and suddenly an ashtray goes into the side of my Pete's head. It' bleeding, and Pete's friend also gets a deep gash from his eyebrow.

This coincides with me starting up martial arts training again after a similar break to ""focus on my career"", whatever that means. Just an excuse to not have to haul myself off the couch after a 10 hour day and go to the dojo I guess. 

The owner of the gym I go to is pretty cool and I'm usually one of the only people there at 6 in the morning, so we talk. He is always trying to find new fitness classes to run and is always lamenting the fact that Zumba is all he really has going for him. I mentioned casually that breaking into kid's karate would be a big money maker, especially since the gym has child care available for parents at night. 

He jumped on the idea right away and asked me if I'd be interested in teaching the class. It was an interesting proposition... 

I've been training in the martial arts since as long as I can remember. I was a navy brat, so I moved a lot. I took karate on the navy base in Hawaii as a kid, and then moved on to Tae Kwon Do off an on for another 10 years with a short break before luckily training in the same style in college. I've also taken some Hakkoryu Ju Jutsu, and dabbled in several other styles for a short enough time that they aren't worth mentioning. I'm currently training in Aikido, which I'm enjoying a great deal as it isn't really like anything I've ever done before. 

The only thing I'm 'qualified' to teach anybody is Tae Kwon Do. Though, I'm not in any associations, and my rank is spread across a dozen locations and years of training, with long periods of studying other arts because nothing else was available. 

So my question is... do I make a go of it, take the money and give these kids the best TKD training I can and do my best to provide them with an experience beyond what a typical mcdojo would give them, or do I just walk away from the deal with the understanding that my martial arts experience is too spread out over time and distance to give them an ""authentic"" experience of any one style?",,False,,t5_2qkt4,1352839325.0,,,True,t3_1352m2,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/1352m2/gym_owner_asked_me_to_run_karate_class_for_kids/,

I've never, outside of training, had a fight go to the ground (as a fight), and 90% of (edit: non-UFC, non-sport) fights do not go to the ground (Edit: feel free to point me to a reputable statistic if you feel if they do).  However, like I said, since it comes up in training, I have that knowledge.  


Although my employers over the past 14 years have all had some form of ground-fighting in their training, all have in some way emphasized that it was not the preferred method of fighting by any means.  As an Army Combatives Instructor, and now as one of my current agency's defensive tactics instructors, ground fighting has always been stressed as a bad idea, but one that you train for if you end up there.  The Army's reasoning was that you could train aggression in a controlled manner, use minimal safety equipment, and not have a high injury rate.  Also, their thinking was that if you end up entangled, you were only working for control until you got the assistance of a buddy, since you rarely ever went alone.  SF individuals that I spoke with stated that their H2H training was much more striking based.  My current agency works with the idea that it can happen, so you basically work enough to either get to your feet, or get them off you to get to your gun.


Today, during a training that I have been in, the instructor took us outside to work ground-fighting on the grass, gravel, and pavement.  For the previous week and a half of 8-hours of daily fighting, we had mostly been on a padded floor, with occasions on some type of smooth granite.  In the Army, most fighting takes place on mats or in a pit of some wonderfully soft material that will be in your clothing for the rest of the day.


Let's take a very basic technique: Escape from the mount.  Opponents is on top, you arch and pull them in, trap the arm and the same-side ankle, and roll to that side, ending up in their guard (and you work an escape from there).  If you have never done this on the concrete, make sure that you are ready to have your arm and elbow violently exfoliated (yes, as the defender).  It was literally at the point where, should I have to perform this in the real word, once I gained the position of advantage, the pain would most likely make me rage and would ensure that I delivered an extra beating to my adversary.


If, for some reason, you plan is to fight on the ground, and the other person has any level of competence (literally, all they need is enough to make it so stuff doesn't instantly work, so you have to actually struggle for something) I hope you are wearing long sleeves or a heavy jacket.  Almost every technique has a trade-off in pain and/or blood.  In the mount?  Your knees and knuckles will hate you, as well as any part of your arm during any control that puts your arm in contact with the ground.  Americana?  You can only do it to one side because it exposes your weapon on the other side.  Also, say goodbye to the skin on your forearms.  Kimura?  Less pain, except for the weapon exposure on one of the sides, but you can effect it into an escape from if you have guard on the bottom.  Guy grabs your weapon?  Roll on to it to pin the hand, and then make what I can only describe as a humping motion, which will GRIND THE HAND under your weight against the ground (This is actually not a bad thing).  [Note, if I mentioned weapon exposure, that technique is not taught in the official system for the agency.]


Also fun training: fighting after being hit with Oleoresin Capsicum.  Just you, not your opponent.  It's not for an extended time, though.

Edit: Ground controls, such as a bar hammer or an arm bar to an opponent that you have swept or joint locked to the ground, are not ""ground fighting."" Those are considered control techniques in which you have taken the opponent down. Otherwise, we can start calling aikido ""ground fighting"", too.

Also I've been in a lot of positions whereby people have had the drop on me and are trying to get me to the ground but can't for say 5 - 20 seconds and during that time I just seem to sort of stand there like a lemon or hop around on one leg while they hold the other one.

What is everybody's opinion of hard conditioning, how much is to much? 

Is it ""healthy"" to punch, kick, or arm bash hard objects to strengthen your body? or is it detrimental to your health?

There are some others that say it causes arthritis and doesn't help when you are older. But that is true about any sport or activity that causes stress on the body.

The sweating isn't generally a problem there because my gi usually soaks it up and there isn't much in the way of grappling.

The problem is more pronounced when because once or twice a week I do some MMA training. When grappling, I end up getting a lot of back and head sweat, which kind of sucks for whoever I'm grappling with. I started bringing a small towel to training for obvious reasons.

I don't want to be the ""overly sweaty guy"" at the dojang, so does anyone have any tips or products that they use to prevent this?

I am now wondering whether I should continue studying Taekwondo at my current school, where I am a first dan black belt (I know belts don't mean much and that is one thing that bothers me about my school), or if I would be better off finding something else.
My current school I worry is a McDojo. While the master (a 7th dan and legit worldwide recognised master) is excelent, I am not personally certain about some aspects of training here.
1. Sparring is mostly non contact, except for when black belts spar, when it is light to medium contact, and although I am sure this helps some aspects of self defence, mainly footwrok and what have you, I think proper contact sparring would be a better solution.
2. The use of belts. Don't get me wrong, I am proud of my black belt, but often feel that it is meaningless. There are redbelts (grade below black) in my class who's taekwondo is better than mine by a fair bit, and black belts who wouldn't stand a chance next to the average 12 year old.
3. softness, and not in the hapkido, baguazhang, ""Soft martial arts"" sense, with redirection ect. Usually in the class everything is fine, we'll be running drills that involve partners blocking the other's punches etc, pretty standard stuff. But seriously, when a senior member of the class pulls me aside and tells me to ""not block so hard"" because I might ""hurt someone's hand"", that's kinda soft. That is literally the point of blocking excercises, to get used to the blocking motion and condition your arms for the blocking action and the possibility of pain when blocking, and this was a 22 year old man complaining to a 17 year old, 5 foot 7 kid.

That said, something important to mention is just how good the master and some of the instructors at other branches (3rd dan and up) are at taekwondo and martial arts in general. All of them are much better than I am, and have had much more experience.

Now my questions are, are these concerns legit or am I worried about nothing?
Is it worth learning martial arts here? (keeping in mind that the people here are nice, the instructor is very good and I generally get along with everyone)
What should I be expecting from a taekwondo class, what do other practitioners do in classes? (we mostly do drills and sparring with some form work and occasionally target striking)


Sorry if you suffered through reading my rant there, if any of you can get back to me on this, it would be greatly appreciated.
Cheers

EDIT: To the clarify, the senior member was a 22 year old red belt, who I was sparring with at the time, it was his arms he was talking about, but he was not injured. I don't have it out for this guy, or anyone in particular though, most people there are pretty nice.

I got pushed around a lot as a kid. That (and probably a few other factors) led to my now lightly-neurotic self. I feel like I've had to deal with stress most of my life, to varying degrees. Now, it's not that bad; I'm not exactly crippled by any of this and I don't need a therapist or pills or anything. Just wanted to give an idea of what it is about myself I'd like to correct. 

I also have little confidence in my ability to protect myself. I'm a big guy, but someone 50 pounds lighter than me with zero training could probably whip my ass. I think this also affects my general demeanor. I'm quite timid in social situations unless I've got a few beers in me. And I don't handle confrontation well. If anyone so much as raises their voice at me I either turn into an abused dog, tail between my legs and pissing myself, or the best case scenario: freeze up, unable to do much but stutter some pathetic reply. 

Lastly, I'm pretty awkward physically. Horrible posture. Clumsy movements. Overweight. All that fun stuff. 

I'd like to have confidence. Be more relaxed. Know that I could handle myself in most situations. Not immediately shut down at the slightest threat (even non-physical). And if I could eventually catch a fly with some chopsticks, all the better. 

So I guess, according to the faq, what's most important to me are: 

Self-Confidence

Inner-peace (maybe with a side of meditation and self-control)

Self-Defense

Now for the places in my area. I'm in Kansas City, and a yelp search brings up a few places, but virtually none of them have reviews. Anyway, they are: 

Tai Chi Chuan

Shaolin Kung Fu

Boxing, Kickboxing and MMA (though the reviews for this place say the focus is more on cardio than proper form and technique)

Kempo / Jui Jistsu

I'm leaning towards the Tai Chi, though I've heard mixed things about the actual combat portion (or the lack of it, rather). ~~But apparently the Chuan varietal focuses more on combat~~? Sorry, it's the ""Yang short form"" version by Cheng Man-Ch'ing. 

I also got my noggin rocked a few times as a kid. Happened again a couple years ago when I fell off my bike and I got the room-spins for three days (no liquor needed!) So whatever I do, probably best to avoid something where I'm getting knocked in the head all the time.

Also, when your opponent goes for a charge/take-down/tackle, you can just kick/knee them into the head.

I've been wondering for a bit. I'm neither experienced nor follow the pro scene that much, but from my limited experiences of watching pros, I haven't witnessed legs being used to counter rushes/tackles. (If you have video examples, please link them away!)

For example, [take a look at this Anderson Silva's video](http://youtu.be/S0xQjAW6Z-o?t=53s) and notice how close his stance comes to his opponents' stances. His opponents can use low kicks keeping out of punching range. [Compared to this fight from K-1](http://youtu.be/OWK_qOkpocc?t=4m5s), you notice the distances are quite different where more low kicks are used.

It's more surprising to me that since there are tackles, the fighters ought to keep their distance even more.

----------------------------------------------

On a separate note, what is the general stance on low kicks? How far do you commit? Is it okay to be in their immediate punching range when low-kicking? Do you focus on more power into the kicks, which would result to swinging your arms and taking them off guard, or do you keep your arms up in defense sacrificing power into the kicks? I'd understand that you'd use both for differing circumstances, so then what are those circumstances?

I finally decided to join and weigh in on something. So to those hardcore Krav people, I have a question that's related to the Americanization and ""McDojo-ization"" of your art.

 TKD get's a bad wrap because of it's prevalence in the McDojo world. Many instructors have turned it into a flimsy art, quick promotions, etc. In comparison, a trend I have been seeing lately has scared me when it comes to Krav, an art that I myself have trained in, in depth, in the past. There are schools and organizations around the country that now offer a one week crash course in Krav, and then give that person a certification allowing them to teach as a ""level one instructor"". I believe subsequent levels can be achieved through other one week courses.

Is this not just a money grab for these organizations? You go train for a week, pay them a few hundred dollars, and in return they give you the privilege of being an ""affiliate school"". After that, I'm not really sure if those affiliates have to pay some sort of royalties back once you bring your week's worth of Krav Training to a school and start teaching it. 

As someone who has dedicated their life to training in martial arts, I cannot see how someone can be trained to be an instructor in ANY art in just a week. It seems like ""bullshido"" to me. It also pains me because I trained for many years in Krav and put a lot of energy into becoming proficient with it, and it definitely didn't happen for me in one week.

It’s like entering bizzaro's world where everything is the exact opposite of what I know. Starting from standing on one thin line, mostly positioning weight equally on both legs and different upper body position. After three weeks my conclusion so far (by no means a final conclusion) is that wing chun is much more focused on defense than attack. They have beautiful and economical defense movements but significantly weaker punches (not sure about kicks yet). They seem never to ‘commit’ to an attack, always playing it safe. I think this philosophy, which has a cultural background to it, is where the differences start from. 
Since the group I’m training with is not used to my ‘all out’ attack style I can say that they are having a hard using their economical defense movements. When I manage to convince some of them to do some free sparing (not so easy) I’m usually able to surprise them with a long attack, although they seem to be adapting to my style with all sorts of nasty little tricks :)
I’m going to write a long article once I learn more but I was wondering if anyone else has this experience or thoughts on the subject?

I am an absolute beginner in martial arts, but I'm looking to start. I was hoping someone might be able to shed some light on what might be the best style for me given what I'm looking for.

I had initially thought that Krav Maga would be a good place to start, but when I looked into it more, I found that firstly, the only two places that teach it in my area are centered around, ""HEY come take this class and shed pounds and then as a second goal learn how to defend yourself!"" and secondly, I'm not sure about the whole purely defense thing. By this I simply mean it seems like Krav Maga, at least the way it's taught around here, teaches just to disable your opponent and run away, which is good, but I think I want something more along the lines of sparring as well as learning self defense.

I've been looking into Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for the past few days, and this seems more up my alley. I was just hoping r/martialarts could answer a couple questions for me:

I want to learn a style that's focused more on using hands than legs/feet. I know BJJ uses a lot of foot/leg motion, but what I mean is I'd want to stay away from something that's more than 50% leg/foot attack i.e. something like kickboxing. Most of all, I want a versatile style, one that's adaptable. Something that can be used for sparring while learning as well as fighting against other martial arts styles and also general self defense. Is BJJ the best for what I'm looking for?

Also, what's a reasonable price? (I'm in the Philadephia, PA suburb area if this matters)

Thanks in advance for any advice, and hopefully I was clear about everything. If anything needs clarification, let me know.

I'm a relatively new martial artist. I've practiced [Katori Shinto Ryu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQB5Lc1C_a8) for a little under four years, and hadn't until recently done anything empty handed.

This summer, I picked up Daito-Ryu Jujitsu through a friend of mine who took the course and invited me. I was aware that they covered the Japanese longsword, but they were heavily focused on more traditional empty hand Japanese jujitsu, and I was very much enjoying the new style and techniques. I didn't see the sword at all.

Yesterday, though, Sensei decided to do a half-hour of sword with the black belts, and had me try it as well (I was the only non-blackbelt there). He thoroughly baffled me with his very first words:

""You hold the sword here, with your back hand just behind the front hand. [Other Sensei I've never met] would tell you to hold the sword with your left pinky finger just off the end of the hilt [the way I've been taught for four years to hold the blade in Katori], but he's dead wrong. Dead wrong, don't do it.""

[EDIT: To avoid confusion, Katori teaches to keep half the pinky finger's width off the back end of the hilt, not the whole finger off]

When I politely asked him about it later, he said that the way I'd been taught was ""Sugino"" style (a reference to the grandmaster who's lineage of Katori I'm learning), but that it wasn't recognized by the North American Kendo Federation [EDIT: Apparently this federation doesn't exist, which means I probably got the name wrong. I'll have to clarify with my Sensei, sorry about that]

It's been causing cognitive dissonance ever since. How am I supposed to react, as a relatively new student, when two very experienced and extensively trained Sensei so strongly contradict each other on something that seems very fundamental? This grip on the sword I'm used to was the first thing drilled into my head at Katori Shinto.

Need a laugh? Worth the read.........

Just try reading this without laughing till you cry!!!

Pocket Tazer Stun Gun, a great gift for the wife.
A guy who purchased his lovely wife a pocket Tazer for their anniversary submitted this:

Last weekend I saw something at Larry's Pistol &amp;amp; Pawn Shop that sparked my interest. The occasion was our 15th anniversary and I was looking for a little something extra for my wife Julie. What I came across was a 100,000-volt, pocket/purse-sized Tazer.

The effects of the Tazer were supposed to be short lived, with no long term adverse affect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to retreat to safety...??

WAY TOO COOL! Long story short, I bought the device and brought it home... I loaded two AAA batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button. Nothing! I was disappointed. I learned, however, that if I pushed the button and pressed it against a metal surface at the same time, I'd get the blue arc of electricity darting back and forth between the prongs.

AWESOME!!! Unfortunately, I have yet to explain to Julie what that burn spot is on the face of her microwave.

Okay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it couldn't be all that bad with only two AAA batteries, right?

There I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently (trusting little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I really needed to try this thing out on a flesh &amp;amp; blood moving target.

I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second) and then thought better of it. She is such a sweet cat. But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to protect herself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would work as advertised.

Am I wrong?

So, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my reading glasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one hand, and Tazer in another.

The directions said that:
a one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant;

a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; and

a three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water.

Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries.
All the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5"" long, less than 3/4 inch in circumference (loaded with two itsy, bitsy AAA batteries); pretty cute really, and thinking to myself, 'no possible way!'

What happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do my best.

I'm sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked to one side so as to say, ' Don 't do it stupid,' reasoning that a one second burst from such a tiny lil ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad.. I decided to give myself a one second burst just for heck of it.

I touched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and...

HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. WHAT THE... !!!

I'm pretty sure Hulk Hogan ran in through the side door, picked me up in the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and over again. I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, and tingling in my legs! The cat was making meowing sounds I had never heard before, clinging to a picture frame hanging above the fireplace, obviously in an attempt to avoid getting slammed by my body flopping all over the living room.

Note:
If you ever feel compelled to 'mug' yourself with a Tazer, one note of caution:

There is NO such thing as a one second burst when you zap yourself! You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a violent thrashing about on the floor!
A three second burst would be considered conservative!

A minute or so later (I can't be sure, as time was a relative thing at that point), I collected my wits (what little I had left), sat up and surveyed the landscape.

My bent reading glasses were on the mantel of the fireplace.
The recliner was upside down and about 8 feet or so from where it originally was.
My triceps, right thigh and both nipples were still twitching.
My face felt like it had been shot up with Novocain, and my bottom lip weighed 88 lbs.
I had no control over the drooling.
Apparently I had crapped in my shorts, but was too numb to know for sure, and my sense of smell was gone.
I saw a faint smoke cloud above my head, which I believe came from my hair.

I'm still looking for my testicles and I'm offering a significant reward for their safe return!

PS: My wife can't stop laughing about my experience, loved the gift and now regularly threatens me with it!

I'm still in college, and just do not have the time I would like to study/practice martial arts. Is there anywhere that I could just go live, study and practice for a year or two? Preferably in the US, but if they exist elsewhere, I could definitely consider them. 

Right now, I feel very out of touch with my 'spiritual' (more mental, as I'm not really into the actual spirit-y stuff, but I love the idea of controlling your own personal energy) side, as well as my physical body (studying CS and math, which really just requires too much sitting time to be healthy).

Just to see if there are any interesting observations and to hear about why so many people, of different walks of life, decided to pick a style and train in it.

For myself it was because when I was younger I was pretty small and got bullied in school frequently. I was quite introverted and shy and didn't make many friends. As a result my grandmother forced me to take up JKD to learn how to defend myself. I didn't even like training at first. But by the time I reached high school I got rather obsessed with martial arts and starting training every day, even if for only an hour, and with that my confidence grew. I learned to stand my ground and while it didn't always guarantee my safety one day the bullying stopped. I came out of my shell, made friends, and to this day I am grateful for her insistence that I took it up.

Basically, with the lead hand, you jab towards the face of your opponent, trying to hit with it, if you land this, great, but if they parry it down or try to block in some way, you spiral your arm under (clockwise, assuming orthodox position) and end up sort of hooking them in the side of the head.

1370896652.0,17,self.martialarts,1g2i1c,Gladiator mouthguard process review and initial impressions,Black6x,18,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/1g2i1c/gladiator_mouthguard_process_review_and_initial/,"A few weeks ago /u/metabug [recommended going the route of custom-molded mouthguards](http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/th7x1/recommendations_for_mouthguard/c4mlbwd), and recommended the company [Gladiator](http://www.gladiatorguards.com/).

In March, during my last dental appointment, I asked my dentist what the cost of a custom mouthguard would be, and was told that it would be somewhere around $450 out of pocket.  Apparently, insurance will not cover something like this.  That was way out of my price range, and I shelved the idea.  

For the past few months, I have been using a Shock Doctor Gel Max mouthguard, which is your average boil-and-bite (BNB) mouthguard.  Nothing special, but a lot less bank breaking.  It was okay at best, didn't really hold to my teeth, required me to constantly suck it back in place, and made talking a pain.  This is the standard experience that I have had with BNBs.

I went to the website, and after some research, settled on the Gladiator Pro.  One of the reasons was that, being the cheaper model, I could but it, and if I wanted the Elite later on, that more expensive model would be half off.  I had been considering buying two mouth guards and Gladiator customer service actually priced it this way, So if you order more than one, the more expensive will be 50% off.

I ordered the Pro, with fangs logo.   Total price was $68, which includes all of the shipping involved (this will make sense as I explain the process).  I will include the timeline of events, so you can understand how fast this happens.

On 5/22/13 (afternoon), I placed my order online.  On 5/25/13, the package for the molds arrived via priority mail.  I should not that I do not have a giant mailbox, but all of the packages for the process fit in the mail, so no running to the post office.

[The package](http://i.imgur.com/zHibDHSh.jpg) included two molds, the mold material, instructions, and a self-addressed priority mail envelope.  Also, there was a slip of paper in the package if the mold tray did not fit on your back teeth.  It directed you to break off two small pieces on the tray in order for it to fit your mouth.  I had to do this for my molds, and it's not too much of a hassle.  Just check the tray beforehand.

Read the instructions before you do anything, because this is not something you want to figure out on the fly.  Mostly because the mold material hardens once you start.  You are given two small boxes with the mold materials in it, and told that you need to mix half of the contents of one with half the contents of the other.  Immediately, I began to dread the idea of trying to measure this correctly.  Fortunately, when you open it up, you find that [it has already been split for you](http://i.imgur.com/LnXdqpZh.jpg).  Also, you need to refrigerate them for about an hour before you mix them (see why you read the instructions).

You knead the first halves with your fingers until it becomes a [light-blue, uniformly colored ball](http://i.imgur.com/IAidjbih.jpg), and then [you place it in the tray](http://i.imgur.com/11OfFWNh.jpg).  You then take the mold and push it onto your teeth (without biting down, and hold it there until it hardens.  Instructions say it may take up to 8 minutes.  Mine was done around 4.  I recommend lying on your back as it makes it easier to swallow your saliva buildup.

Do this twice, and you now have [2 impressions](http://i.imgur.com/yhgkiSzh.jpg).  You put these in the supplied bags, write your name on the bags, and send it in the supplied envelope.

I mailed mine on 5/28/2013.


On 6/10/13 (approx 8-9 business days) I receive a n envelope in the mail.

I tried the mouthguard on, and the fit between the Gladiator and the Shock doctor is night and day.

[Side by side](http://i.imgur.com/lvUShFgh.jpg)

[Front shots](http://i.imgur.com/sTeBflgh.jpg)

[Case shots](http://i.imgur.com/sTeBflgh.jpg)

The Shock Doctor [weighed in at 3/8 ounces](http://i.imgur.com/PS2h9fJh.jpg).  The Gladiator Pro [weighed in at 1/8 oz](http://i.imgur.com/hISV6nsh.jpg).  If you look at the top down pictures, the Gladiator has significantly less material behind the front teeth, so I assume that's where a lot of weight is lost.  There also appears to be a lot less outer bulk.  Understand that since the Shock Doctor is something you mold yourself, There's a slightly harder outer surface (the black part), which I assumes gives it support as you mold it.  Unfortunately, with teh BNB, you always have this.

The Gladiator Pro fits EXCELLENTLY.  When I put it on, I could open my mouth and talk without the guard falling off my teeth.  It was like it was attached, and actually takes a little bit of a pull to remove.  It also goes above the gum-line on the front teeth.  IOt's probably about 2-3mm higher than the SD.

My only complaint at this time is that the front tooth of the mold chipped off in the mail.  I have emailed customer support, and will update later as to their response.

**EDIT  OP delivers.  Customer service emailed me back approximately an hour after my email.

my story - long but bear with me...

i was at the scottish sambo open a year or so back and had worked my way through the brackets all the way to the sami-final, my opponent and i both went in for a throw at the same time and sort of crumpled under each others weight, it was a sloppy landing but i edged it in my favour at the last minute, landing better than he did.

 the ref, rightly, awarded no points and told us to continue so we did, when suddenly the president of the british sombo federation jumped up and shouted at the ref to award 4 points to my opponent, the ref did as he was told and changed his decision, costing me the match and a place in the finals.

(i was the beaten fair and square in the bronze match up with an ura-nage)

point is, i could have accepted the loss on points. i cant accept losing by outside interference. dosent piss me off, just annoys me.

While I'm away much of my practice in the martial arts involves repetition, fitness, and more intellectual manners of study as opposed to learning new techniques.

At this moment, my test for Shodan is tentatively scheduled for this coming summer. However, my Sensei is very adamant in his students understanding both the mental and physical aspects of being a martial artist, something I greatly admire. While the physical test is scheduled for the summer, there are a few requirements I must complete before I am permitted to test.

Firstly, I must visit a minimum of six traditional martial art schools during a class time and write summaries of my visit. How their styles are similar/different from my own. How I believe I could benefit from certain teachings I observed at said school, and how I believe they could benefit from certain teachings of ours. This is to help us understand that there is no one, great style out there. That each can benefit from the knowledge of other martial artists. Which brings about my first question:
Does anybody know of good schools in the Newton/Boston area a broke college student would be able to observe a class at during his free time? I want to make the most out of these observations, to learn as much as I can instead of just getting them out of the way.

I also have to read a variety of books on martial arts philosophy, teach a full class, and grade a test for rank of a lower-ranked student. All of which I've completed.

My second question has to do with the more physical side of things. At school, I can practice my kata, my techniques, lift weights, run, do Parkour, all sorts of physical training that will help me be a better martial artist. However, sometimes I feel like it isn't enough. Outside of my kata and my kihon I feel like I could be doing some more martial arts-specific training. I don't have partners to spar with, or to hit mits with as I don't know many other people at my school who train martial arts. So this brings about my second question:
Would any of you be able to recommend any martial arts-specific workouts that I could do alone and would really present a physical challenge to get me in the best possible shape for my Shodan test? 

Thank you all.

TL;DR: I want to be prepared for my Shodan test and be an overall better martial artist. While I am at college and away from my dojo, are there any schools I could visit in Boston and any challenging martial arts workouts I could do on my own that r/martialarts would recommend?",,False,,t5_2qkt4,False,,,True,t3_165a6k,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/165a6k/preparing_to_test_for_shodan/,

So just download a viewer and you are good to go. Thanks to everyone to contributed to this list, if you have any more, feel free to add them. These are books on mainly philosophy, inspiration, and mindset, I'm trying to avoid basic manuals, the books that are picture heavy diagrams of techniques. Can't learn a technique from looking at pictures in books anyway in my opinion, only by practicing with others. That said Aikidio and The Dynamic Sphere does break that rule but it was a top pick from many of the users.

EDIT: For the record I'm not implying by ""free"" that people should go pirating any books but if they are already on many public websites for download, widely available to anyone who knows how to use google then I don't see the harm in downloading freely published literature. That said if you read a book and you like it and the author is alive and you think he deserves credit then go find the book in a bookstore if you can (some may not even be available anywhere but online) and buy it. As I said below this list was meant for educational purposes, not a torrenting christmas list. I can't stop you from doing it, but I can ask that you support writers, they really don't make a lot unless they are best sellers. Now imagine what a martial arts writer makes...

The list so far, thanks again to everyone to contributed. I'm adding books as they come, maybe we could have the mods add a link to the sidebar? That'd be cool for future reference.

I don't really feel confident enough in my judo (and obviously not my boxing or the... \*cough\* black belt in TKD that I got from a McDojo as a young teen...) that I could call it a ""base"" though. Would it be a waste of time to enroll in MMA classes at this point in my development? Should I just keep on doing judo or what? I've found a place nearby that seems to have a pretty decent reputation, but my budget is such that I can only really afford their MMA class and not really cross-train in anything else for the time being. Truth be told, I've actually already started classes there, so this is kind of just me second-guessing myself, I suppose.

Of course, I don't really want to make this thread specifically about me. I also kind of just wanted to hear people's thoughts about how long in general it should take before one can consider themselves ""proficient"" in a martial art and, as asked in the title, how much training in general one should have before trying to mix things up with MMA? 

I hear a lot of opinions in both camps, with some saying that training in MMA prematurely just makes you kind of sloppy and mediocre at everything, whereas others say that training in MMA is, in the end, the best way to train for MMA. So... I dunno. I defer to the rest of you guys.",,False,,t5_2qkt4,True,,,True,t3_q44ty,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/q44ty/how_important_is_it_to_have_a_base_before/,

I have an issue in my classes and I was wondering how you all have dealt with similar situations. 
       I´m currently training in Taekwondo and Hapkido. Our gym is great, and so are our Masters. The problem is one guy. He constantly tries to stand out in the class. He shows off by practicing movements or kicks while the Master is explaining to the class what we are to do next. Thats not so much as bad as it is annoying. 
      The problem is the is extremely critical of the people around him. Some examples, last class I was partnered with him to practice kicks. I would do the kick and he would give me a horrible glare and shake his head. Ok, fine. 
Next example. We recently had a testing. The day after we recieve our belts, he goes to a girl who just recieve her yellow belt. ¨ Your ap chagui is horrible, I´m surprised you passed.¨ He made her cry! 
When he was waiting for his new belt after our testing, he actually threw his old belt on the floor in formation. 
Has anyone else ever had to deal with someone so mean and disrepectful? 

Edit: One big problem is the language barriers. He is Bolivian, I´m North American, and our Masters are Korean, and our gym is in Spain. Our master speak very little Spanish so, when he makes a remark they usually don´t understand.

Post here what your style is, the rules of your sparring and what you use for protection so that we can compare, contrast and discuss or perhaps even take on some new ideas.

In MMA at our gym we wear MMA open fingered gloves and mouthguards, groin cups and shin guards are optional.  All ranges are allowed.  Using the wall is allowed.  No gripping the clothing, fish hooks, groin strikes, small joint manipulation, head butts or eye pokes are allowed.  Slams and suplexes are allowed at low amplitude.  Elbows, stomping, soccer kicks and knees to the head on the ground are allowed at low force.  Striking power is agreed upon between students prior to sparring.  Striking on the ground is obviously allowed as well as in a clinch.

For wrestling every type of takedown is allowed but no grabbing the clothing.  Only low amplitude/ non-injurious suplexes and spiking are allowed.  The loser is the one pinned to their back for three seconds.  King of the hill between 3-4 people is the order of the day.  We generally just use mouthguards.

For BJJ/ submission wrestling it's the same as usual BJJ, just no gi, no grabbing cloth allowed and sometimes we start from the feet.  All subs are allowed but dangerous twisty leg locks have to be done slowly and with control, as well as cranks and slices and such.  Tap to give up.  Just mouthguards.

MT/ standing striking is usually anything goes except headbutts, groin shots and eye pokes, etc.  Elbows and knees at low power are okay.  Reset if one person gets thrown down.  Mouthguard and gloves are mandatory; headgear, groin cups, elbow and shin guards are optional.

For the FMA (doce pares escrima) some people use WEKAF type stuff, but I try to just use a fencing mask, mouth guard, stickfighting gloves and rattan sticks or blunt, wooden or foam knives.  We use lighter weight sticks sometimes.  Other times we use padded rattan sticks.  It's much more varied what people wear, some use knee and elbow guards like you get for roller skating, forearm guards, groin guards, varying helmets, etc.  All ranges are allowed, unarmed strikes are allowed, grappling is allowed, but no vigorous groin strikes or vicious throat punyos.",,False,,t5_2qkt4,False,,,True,t3_o0yie,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/o0yie/what_rules_and_gear_do_you_use_in_sparring/,

If you put the martial arts you study it will let others know what you study and hopefully try and find like-minded people.

.

Don't be stupid with the feature, anyone who is using this inappropriately to  either curse or heckle other people will have the option removed. If you see anyone who is abusing this feature make sure you report them via mod mail so they can be dealt with accordingly.



Hopefully it can make the community better and make it easier to find like minded people.

Many of the traditional schools crank out 12 year old ""black-belts"" left and right. They limit training techniques because they don't want liability if someone gets hurt in training. And they certainly teach nothing in the way of an ""art."" No philosophical undertones to training, no mastery of mind and body, etc. They take training that should span over at least a decade to master and water down and compress it into a few years of memorizing forms and breaking wooden boards to advance in level. The belt becomes everything. And they don't even know how to react when someone hits them.

Many schools of realistic fighting styles don't teach anything in terms of real world applicability, and they don't teach their students how to take a hit or how to deal with pain. They give you a good work out as they teach you techniques that will get you killed in the real world. They hold out on the ""good techniques"" that have the potential to save your life one day until you have been in the program long enough and have paid enough money to be considered worthy of learning them.

It seems these McDojos simply focus on collecting the paycheck after every lesson. They make you buy ridiculously priced equipment and put you through expensive testing and graduation ceremonies. They hold useless seminars that you must pay for and attend in order to advance.

They insult the memories and taint the names of the creators/founders of the many different arts and styles.

1. Who follows this way of anger and aggression to fuel your own progression?

2. Who follows the opposite of a calm, almost emotionless approach?

3. Do you like your way or would you rather change it?

EDIT:

Please read the article. The most outstanding sentence for me is:

&gt;Being capable of harnessing that intense feeling of contempt and then use anger and aggression as allies is the key to maximum productivity.

I'm not entirely happy with ""emotionless calm"" as the other side of the spectrum. I am however well aware that there are not only two discrete conditions but a continuous spectrum.

Anger/Aggression --------------------------0-------------------------- Calm/Emotionlessness

And everyone has a tendency towards one or the other. So far my assumptions

EDIT 2:

To clarify some things:

* Aggression in this context is only the aggression paired with anger. I used the words of the author, but I thought the context would be clear. Which obviously is not.

* this is not about me. I know which type I am, and it works good for me. If anything, I'd need more aggression - which is not really on the same scale as Anger/Hate vs Calm/No emotions.

* I'm completely on the Calm side. I don't seek any advice or guidance. I'm fine, thanks. This is not about me, but about the idea behind it. 

* ***The reason why I think this is worthy of discussion: there are enough people who do use and recommend usage of anger/hate towards people they know to push themselves when doing something hard. This can be either in a fight or in any kind of work out. I'm quite sure that many of you know a friend or do it yourself, imagining that douche when hitting the punching bag or when the last few pushups are so hard.***

So this approach is used and recommended, thus the discussion of it is of merit. That was my thought, but obviously that was too much untold thinking by me.",,False,,t5_2qkt4,1358118619.0,,,True,t3_16hol5,http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/16hol5/your_approach_to_martial_arts_anger_and/,

My question is why? Does it just look outlandish? Or have you tried it before? What is it about the pressure point arts that bothers you all? A few points here though.

* This is for the post itself. Im not here to say my martial art is better than your martial art. Im here to see why everyone denounces it and why (Id really rather you not just claim ""fake and gay""). I'm also not saying that you should solely rely on these arts in a fight..they just wouldn't stand up, because you have to have the advantage during a stand-up fight and be given a pretty good opportunity (ground fights are sort of different). Its like a compliment to your already good training.

* From the time that I spent in these arts I couldn't help but notice that pressure points are there, and they hurt. And different ways of attacking different points seem to truly vary the amount of pain. Its not like you can ""half ass it"" either..maybe a few, but not on the arms. Often you have to be right on where you need to be to get the right effect. A certain ""energy"" or projected force from your strike, if you prefer..is needed. So, a right direction, and a right force is needed.

This is master higgenbotham. I've trained under him a few times. 

I think that I'm as skeptical as anyone out there, but my moneys on it being true. I say this because I have yet to be knocked out. Once I talk to my sensei at the dojo after my hiatus, one of the first things I will ask is to be ko'd.

Its all debatable I guess. So go for it.

Edit 1: I created this post when I was dead tired last night. I looked for a video of Will Higgenbotham because I know him and just chose a video of him performing what many in this art practice. I personally don't like this video as much and I should have explained that. Not until I go back to try training at that dojo and ask to be knocked out will I take it as truth.

Edit 2: There is a certain ""mystic aspect"" to pressure points that seems to cause many to denounce it. In a way I see chi and energies as something like religion. It was a way to explain things things before science and a stronger knowledge of anatomical happenings came about to bring out what exactly is going on in the body. Don't go on me like ""Religions totally fake so that means that these pressure points are fake!""

Edit 3: How I see pressure points: AGAIN it doesn't stand up in a real fight if you RELY on these combos of points to try and take someone out. Theres a good time to use them and a bad time. The dojo I went to talked a lot about pressure points, but we integrated them into other arts and some practical applications. And of course sizing up your opponent through the fight helps you see holes in their armor as any arts do.

We still have around 2-3+ people asking the same question every day, despite claims they read the FAQ.

""Which martial art should I study?""

And then we go through the whole routine, where are you looking for in a martial art, what do you hope to gain from it, blah blah etc etc. 

*Every* day. Multiple times. Now I downvote post and upvote the common answer always given but perhaps it's time for a revamp, especially as our small subreddit grows. Sadly most of the answers given in posts are actually far more in depth than the FAQ. The FAQ mainly deals in common martial arts traits and what's nearby to your location.

Anyone have any ideas? I think we could conglomerate and collectively write/make changes as long as the mod is okay with it. (Is the single mod here even active still? I've been subscribed for months but don't recall seeing him/her ever post.)

Anyways, just some thoughts, I'd like to hear yours as well.

The different Norwegian castes each learned different weapons, although the underlying principles remain the same.  Runes are used as a mnemonic for a number of tai chi-like slow meditative forms which also have combat applications.
