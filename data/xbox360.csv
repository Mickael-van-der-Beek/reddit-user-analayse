 &gt; stable, dedicated servers for every multiplayer game rather than the notoriously fragile practice of hosting matches on one participant’s console; even multiplayer matches that can grow to 64, even 128 participants, rather than the usual limit of 16 or 32.

This has always been my biggest problem with console gaming. They develop these top-notch multiplayer games, then host servers on some kid's dirty Xbox on a residential internet connection.

A lot of people think we never see big games on Xbox 360 because of the graphical limitations, but it's almost entirely a network issue.

I figured with the 'big' lineup coming in a few months, that some games you guys have might be getting 'stale' or boring to you.  If that's the case, just hop on over, subscribe, and browse the communities games to see if there's anything of interest to you.

It's really simple, and you don't have to worry about gettin $3 for that game you bought last year - just get a different game!  We also allow console/hardware swaps as well!

She stated that any gamertag that plays on this console will be a 'gold'. XB360 users will still have to pay for their individual accounts still. 

Also, if you are a family plan member your auto-renew will probably not happen after its next renewal period.




EDIT: RegularJohn17 via /r/xboxone/ said it better than me

You pay for gold and you have a ""home"" console where your gamertag and all your games/dlc licences live. If any other gamer tag signs in on this (even if your not signed in) they can use your gold status even if they don't pay for gold.

If you go sign in at a friends house who doesn't have gold you can use the advantages of your gold but then when your friend signs back into his gamertag he cant use gold anymore.

Pretty simple really. It just means that families don't need multiple gold accounts anymore. Just one per console. At least that is my understanding.

After some investigating, I noticed that a Skyrim promotional outfit had been purchased while I was at work. I questioned (read: berated) my wife about this, to which she denied any wrongdoing. Fast forward about an hour, and I notice my 15 month old daughter grabbing the XBOX remote, pressing the center button and turning the box on. She then proceeds to press every button on the blasted controller, and also moved around the control stick.

Intrigued, I switch the input to the XBOX and notice she has opened up the marketplace and was attempting to purchase something. Then it dawned on me: she must have button-mashed her way to purchasing the outfit.

I understand that XBL has a strict ""no-refunds"" policy, so I feared the worst. I contacted XBL support, and spoke with a wonderful woman named Nicole who identified with my plight, and agreed to have the points added back to my account. We had a good laugh, and the experience was not only effective, but I wasn't on hold for more than a couple of minutes.

Then, to my surprise, I noticed the outfit was still available for my avatar, so I basically got it for free. Not wanting to game the system, I called XBL support back and told them about the error, to which they told me that it was a gift for my young daughter, and she should wear it proudly once she gets to the age where she actually knows what she's pushing.

Overall, a wonderful experience which I thought I would share with you guys, in case you were concerned about how strict the ""no refunds"" policy really was.

**TL;DR:** Infant daughter bought an avatar outfit, XBL support gave me points back and told me to keep said outfit.",,False,self,t5_2qhk2,False,,,True,t3_m3ki2,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/m3ki2/xbox_live_customer_service/,

I can load the initial start menu, then the cutscene plays. Once the cutscene has ended, the controller layout screen shows. 15 seconds later, it comes up with an error saying that the 'disk is unreadable', and then returns to the dashboard.

I've tried:

- Deleting the game and redownloading it
- Redownloading the game (and title update) to an external USB
- Clearing the system cache and restarting the console
- Copying the game from a friend's console to my console

Has anyone else had this issue? It only happens with Forza, not any other of my GoD games (or physical games). Thanks for any help!

Edit: FOUND THE SOLUTION!

I had to license transfer to my account, then I re-downloaded the game (which was instant since it was already on the hard drive). Apparently it's a known issue but there's yet to be an official fix. Hopefully should be patched ASAP.

The PS3 (as much as I can't stand it) has a clean dashboard, minimal ads, and crazily enough, starts you out on the games tab. We aren't paying for dedicated servers, or to undercut the need for advertising. We don't get free games like the PS+ plan that was introduced for PS3. What we do get is 2% of our MSP back and thats only if we've bought enough games to break the required Gamerscore level. I really wish this didn't sound so bitchy, but as a loyal 360 gamer, I find a 2% return (on maybe $20 a month) worse than nothing and the amount of ads insane for a paid subscription. If anyone can explain this to me in a way that makes sense, I'd appreciate it, but right now it seems like we aren't getting what we're paying for: a visceral online experience.

Edit: $60 is list price, not what I'm paying. Stop with the snarky comments. ",,False,self,t5_2qhk2,1354217421.0,,,True,t3_13zqu9,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/13zqu9/gold_what_are_we_paying_for/,

(works with PC/Mac/Linux),HolyLiaison,176,47,144,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/13r7bz/turning_your_xbox_360_in_to_a_media_center_via/,"This is going to be long, so bear with me here. First post here, just sub'd!

If you want to skip to the bread and butter below just head down to the TL;DR which gets right to the point.

SO!

I just recently bought an Xbox 360 after having been a PC/PS3 guy since the beginning of time. I just couldn't help my self with all the sweet deals going on these last few weeks.

After years of using my PS3 pretty much flawlessly as a media center I decided to give it a go on my Xbox so I didn't have to switch between consoles constantly if I wanted to watch something in my collection. This is when things got a little interesting. 

Over the years I've used quite a few Media Servers: PS3 Media Server, TVersity, Windows Media Player, PlayOn, Vuze, VLC, etc etc.. and I ended up settling on PS3 Media Server for my PS3 (more recently I switched to an off-shoot of it called Universal Media Server) since it usually played 90% of the stuff I wanted to watch with out too much hassle. So I figured any one of those would probably work great with Xbox 360. Boy was I wrong! 

Most of these servers could stream some of my video files to my Xbox, some couldn't at all. Or they only supported a small amount of formats compared to what I was used to on my PS3. I ended up getting so frustrated with it that I gave up for about a week.

I came back still frustrated about it, but determined to find something that worked. I ended up searching on Wikipedia for a list of UPnP A/V servers and (like always) [Wikipedia delivered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UPnP_AV_media_servers_and_clients).

I ended up going through almost every option on that list, testing out multiple file types, subtitle support and stuff like that. Over and over.

Then I ran in to one program called [Plex Media Server](http://www.plexapp.com/). And things started looking great. Setup is kinda confusing at first because you do it all through a web interface, but after you get the hang of things the program runs fantastic. I haven't ran in to a file it couldn't play yet. Even all of my anime with sub titles works perfectly.

They even have apps on Android/iOS/Windows Phone 7 that let you stream remotely from your server to your phone/tablet, and it also works great! I've been using the Android app while at work on break. Only downside is the mobile app costs a few dollars.

In the end I found my solution, and I can now use my Xbox to stream just about anything I want with out having to switch between consoles!


**TL;DR**: Use [Plex Media Server](http://www.plexapp.com/) - it works fantastic with my Xbox 360, and MANY other devices!",,False,self,t5_2qhk2,False,,,True,t3_13r7bz,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/13r7bz/turning_your_xbox_360_in_to_a_media_center_via/,

* After a little time passes I will put the top 25 most upvoted comments in a Google Document and submit it here to see if you guys are alright with it. 
* And lastly maybe the mods could post a link to the document in the side-bar.

As for keeping the list current, we could just do another thread like this one whenever we're ready to update the list. We can decide when to update it later.

Also if you have a flash drive acting as storage it still DOES NOT work, the game keeps saying it requires a official xbox 360 hdd.

* Games:

 (Since this has been done to death in this subreddit, I'm simply linking to previous post). [Non Shooters](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/myjlz/ive_read_most_of_the_old_threads_what_games_do/), [Games to play with your girlfriend](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/mzb10/games_to_start_my_girl_friend_on/), [New to 360](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/mqh2p/new_xbox_360_what_games_should_i_get/), [Got money, what games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/ltcil/stumbled_into_a_few_hundred_bucks_what_games/) and [Hello McFly's well thought out list](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/nr25u/for_everyone_who_got_a_360_for_christmas/c3bawnn)

* Storage:
The Xbox 360 (either phat or slim) is sometimes bundled with some small amount of storage built in.  256mb, 512mb, or in the case of the new slims 4gb.  These paltry amounts are enough for your gamertag, a few gamesaves, and maybe a bit of DLC in the slim. 

For additional storage you have two options; **external USB** or **internal hard drives**.  

With **external USB** you can attach USB hard drives or USB flash drives, *but the 360 only allows you to allocate up to 16gb for use per USB device with a limit of two concurrent USB storage devices*. That means if you connect a 500gb external USB drive, the 360 will only allocate 16gb of that as usable storage for things like DLC and gamesaves. The remainder should be accessible for storage of music or video files however.  If you are going to go external USB storage, [16gb thumb drives are pretty cheap these days](http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Cruzer-Flash-Drive-SDCZ36-016G-A11/dp/B001T99ZTI) and would be a pretty ideal solution.   Note: With external USB drives if you want to use them for video/music they MUST be formatted to FAT32! 

With **internal hard drives** you gain the added bonus of backwards compatibility to Xbox 1 games as well as the ability to install games (something you cannot do with USB storage) not to mention their vastly larger capacity.  Installed games still require the disc in the tray to start up, but will then play from the hard drive reducing load times and noise.   Yes, if you want to you can [hack some SATA drives into working with the 360](http://tinyurl.com/2dfb884) but be careful it requires specific drives to work.   **Also worth mentioning** is that if you have an older phat that is being replaced by a new slim, you can bust the hard drive out of the shell, and slap it into a [cheap slim enclosure](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/internal-hard-drive-disk-case-for-xbox-360-slim-black-56461) and it will work.  **teamshred has correctly pointed out that the slim casing is not required, you can fit the bare drive in without it.

* Hardware / Accessories:

[Ventilation is important](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/nr25u/for_everyone_who_got_a_360_for_christmas/c3bbwb3).  Do not shove your 360 into an entertainment center and close the doors - the 360's worst enemy is heat.

Video Connection - If your Xbox has the option of HDMI out, USE IT!  IF you were just going to use the composite (red,white,yellow) then you might as well have got a Wii.   If you don't have HDMI then Component (red,blue,green) is good too, and can do HD resolutions. 

Protect your disc - they are fragile and scratch easily. 

Batteries - rechargeable battery packs are awesome and could save you a bunch when using wireless controllers.  Looks for deals online that are guaranteed to be cheaper than in brick and mortar stores.  Maybe people will have specific suggestions below. 

Headsets - Headset questions are another one frequently asked in this subreddit, so [linking to a quick search](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/search?q=headset&amp;restrict_sr=on) will give you tons of info. 

If you have a ""phat"" 360, install all your games on the HD. This will make it quieter, and it will save wear and tear on your discs and your DVD drive, which is a notorious weak point still to this day. And along those lines, don't move your 360 while there is a spinning disc in it.

* Xbox Live:

Be careful attaching your credit card to your Xbox Live account.  Automatic annual billing is a pain in the ass to get removed, and if you account was ever compromised with your credit card attached thieves can quickly rack up large bills.  [Prepaid cards](http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-LIVE-Month-Gold-Membership-360/dp/B0029LJIFG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324910711&amp;sr=8-1) are an easy solution for buying Live subscriptions and points and will often get you a better deal.

The first few (somewhere between 3-5) times you create a new Xbox Live profile on your console and select No to the ""Upgrade to gold?"" option you will automatically be granted a 1 month free gold trial. So if you are just trying to milk out having Live as long as possible without paying for it you could create a new account once a month for the first few.

The Family Pack - This is probably the best/easiest deal with Live. You get 4 gold accounts for $99/yr whereas a full price single annual is $59/yr.  You do NOT have to be on the same Xbox or even in the same household to use those profiles, so you could get 4 friends together and each pitch in $25 for a years worth of Gold.  There are however [a few issues with the ""main"" account being the parent and some people having approval/rating issues](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/nr25u/for_everyone_who_got_a_360_for_christmas/c3bb0wc), but YMMV.

Parental Controls - for those of you that might have little ones you are trying to be protective of, the Xbox has parental controls that will allow you to lock them out of games above a certain rating. I'm not an expert here so if you have specific questions just ask and someone will know and answer. 

* Media Playback:

You have to have an Live Gold account to use Netflix or Hulu Plus - that sucks, we know.  I personally think the Windows Media Center application is pretty great and with the ""Optional Media Update"" (free) the 360 can playback DivX, XviD, or H.264 encoded MP4's and AVI's as well as MKV files now.   Lots of people here also use and really like [PS3 Media Server](http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/)  (yes it works with the 360 too) and I use and like [Orb](http://www.orb.com/en/download.html) and [PlayOn](http://www.playon.tv/index.php) as well.  PlayOn is a paid app but it transcodes not only your local video but lots of web content too. 


**Alright, I'm running out of ideas/steam on this, so if you have specific questions or suggestions you'd like addressed, feel free to mention it and I'm sure either I, or the /r/xbox360 community can answer**

Thanks to tutoring and being in college I have some expendable income, so I I thought I'd post as honest a review as I can here and let people know if they should buy this newfangled contraption. So here goes.

To get it out of the way, yes, I like it.  A lot.  On an academic level it's the single coolest piece of mass-marketed tech I've ever seen, and if you can't play with one you absolutely should try.  But that doesn't mean it's without faults, room for improvement and impending growing pains.  I'm just really pumped for when they really kick this thing into gear and am more than happy to be the early-adopter guinea pig.

**Hardware**

The hardware is the coolest part to me.  The face recognition was spot on (I stepped in front, waved and it signed me in, my friend did the same while I was in the frame), voice recognition works well (though I didn't really use it all that much), and the motion tracking is astounding.  To be fair, I approach it like a CS/Computer Vision nerd, so I just think the fact that it can draw a skeleton on two people, simultaneously, while correctly ignoring all background noise in real time is nearly instant nerdgasm.  It also works.  Really well.

There is lag, but you get used to it.  It doesn't do well with really fast maneuvers (frantically waving your hands side to side for a while causes some weird contortions or lag), and there were a few times where I was mad at the lag for missing a fast spike in volleyball, but other than maybe once I never really noticed it after the first few minutes.

It glitched out a few times, of course, and I'll cover that below.

**Play Area**

We had to rearrange the furniture (I live in an apartment) and it was still a little cramped, but we have to do the same thing for full Rockband sessions, so it wasn't a hassle.  Not nearly the death-blow I was worrying it would be.  It's definitely BETTER with bigger space, but apartment dwellers can make due if they're willing to shuffle some things around.

**UI**

The UI in this is amazingly slick, but it can get weird.  The method of logging in (standing and waving at the sensor) can take a while and the indicators of how well you're doing aren't always clear.  Once logged in though, it's pretty awesome.  I got used to navigating with a wave of a hand, that I was actually sad when I had to go back to buttons on the dashboard (there's a ""Kinect Hub"" which auto opens when you engage Kinect, but it can't do everything).  The controls for ESPN were fantastic, and I felt like I was in Minority Report.  The Hub is limited in what it can do, as mentioned above, and I'd really like to see support for remote video and Netflix added soon (couldn't find remote video in the hub, though I didn't look that hard).  Even without that, the feeling of controlling everything like a Jedi was sick.

**Games**

* Bit of background*: I play lots of videogames (less now due to school), mostly FPS, racing or the occasional sport, so I'm definitely not a ""casual gamer"" (though not all that hardcore).  That said, I'm sure the WoW/CoD/Starcraft/Minecraft/hipster addicts would look down on me for my taste in games (everything from TF2 to Madden).  So I guess just be aware that I come in thinking both WiiSports and CoD are really fun and entirely valid ways to game.

I got Kinect Sports, Dance Central and Fitness Plus (plus the included Kinect Adventures).  They're all fun, though some more than others (Kinect Adventures is kinda fun, especially if I didn't have other games, but they should have included Sports instead).  

* *Kinect Sports* was the one I spent the most time with, and it's really, really fun.  Volleyball was intense, Table Tennis was very impressive (more fun than Rock* Tabletennis, which I thought was surprisingly fun), and soccer was definitely an interesting take.  The motion tracking is in full form, and though there were a few ""oopsy"" moments while getting used to the motion tracking (kicking the soccerball on the upswing, accidentally shotputting a bowling ball, that kind of thing), it's still really, really fun.  Much better than WiiSports IMO, and that was the game I spent the most time with on my Wii (before I sold it for my 360 :) ).

* *Dance Central* was probably the most hyped, so I won't go into it.  It's fun, and if you aren't too uptight to attempt to bust some awkward whiteboy moves it can be really fun.  Plus, no controller = hands free for alcohol.

* The other surprising game for me was *Fitness Plus*.  I'm not a big fitness buff, mostly due to a lack of motivation, and I was hoping that this game would help a bit with that.  And it really, really did.  Granted I'd feel like more of a manly man if I was lifting weights, but this shit got my heart pumping and turned calories burned into a high score.  This game isn't really ""fun"" in the traditional sense, because it really is workouts and if you're as out of shape as me you will get winded, but I felt better about myself once I finished this than I ever have after a marathon of CoD.  I could see playing it more than the others if only to get my pudgy ass into shape by way of a high score.  Plus the minigames aren't bad, especially the kickboxing box breaker one.

Note: I played these with my roommates, one of whom is a ""hardcore"", spend-8-hours-a-night-playing-CoD (or Minecraft).  He had fun with the sports and wouldn't touch the dancing.  The only game he really got into was Fitness, as it's unlike anything else out there.  Literally nothing can do what Kinect can do in terms of fitness games, WiiFit doesn't compare.

**Glitches/Bad Things**

Glitches do happen, and when they do there's no button mashing to be had.  The only way is to back out of the field of view and walk back in.  This happened once:
Once when friends were playing on me and my roommate's account (calibrated to our bodies, actual players didn't look like us) and then my friends crossed in front of each other and one walked to just the edge of the plain.  It lost track of who was who, and just kinda freaked out.  Had to stop, walk out of the sensor area, and walk back in, which fixed it.  Not horrible, but not great.

There are small glitches here and there, but nothing big enough to worry about or break the feeling:

* Whenever you walk in front of someone, it momentarily thinks you're them.  If you stand close, you might take focus from them, so they have to wave their hand in front of you and ""reclaim"" focus.

* The Wave to sign on thing can be finicky to get to work every time.  Only happens once per session, and gets easier with practice.

* Pausing is done through a set movement of right hand at side, left hand at angle.  This works throughout every game, but to limit false positives they've put the time it takes to pause really long (around 3-5 seconds).  The first few times that's helpful to get used to the motion, but I'd like there to be a way to set that to be more reactive.  There might be a way to fix it, it just wasn't apparent.

Mostly little things, nothing that makes me want to sell it and buy a Move.

**Good things**

* First and foremost, I got off my ass while playing fairly entertaining video games.  I enjoyed it, and actually felt a few of those mystical workout endorphins.

* The pictures the camera takes a certain points in the game (jumps, dance moves, etc.)are a hilariously entertaining addition, and add a definite party sense to the experience.  Yes, you will look ridiculous playing most of these games, but who gives a fuck, they're fun.

* The tech is unbelievable.  The motion tracking, though not as precise as Move, works, in the ""it just works"" way.

* I played Adventures online with a friend halfway across the country, and I could see all the mannerisms and movements she made.  It actually felt like she was there, which was really, really cool.

* You can eat and drink while gaming without worrying about getting your hands dirty or putting down food/drink to play.  This was surprisingly awesome.

* This thing is fucking magic.  I've studied a lot of CS/CoE, and I can figure out at a high level how most things work in the computer realm.  I couldn't DO everything, but if you asked I could give a rough breakdown of how most things work.  But this thing is black magic.  I know the sensors it has in it, but the methods used to do what it does are mystifying, and I realized I haven't felt that around tech in a while.

**Wrap Up**

This thing is a really, really cool device.  It's a lot of fun in groups, and I noticed that it changed how I interfaced with games.  Plus, I got off my ass which felt good.  It has a few issues, but they're mostly software and can be ironed out with future releases.

**If you have some tutoring money laying around**, or have a generous Santa Claus, this thing is worth it.  **Is it worth selling a kidney** or skipping meals just to get your hands on one RIGHT now? **No**, it isn't, especially since it really hasn't started to be used to its full potential yet.

I'd equate this with the first version of DDR.  It costs a bit more than is comfortable, is a fuckton of fun (especially in groups), forces you to change your surroundings a bit, you'll look like an idiot playing it and not care, and has the ability to drastically change an entire market.  Just like DDR or Donkey Konga eventually became Rockband 3 with a real guitar as an input, this is a novel tech that could lead to really, really cool things.  If you know someone with one, play with it for a while, it's worth it.

**tl;dr**

Kinect is really fucking cool, and has a whole lot of potential with a few hiccups. If you can comfortably afford it (and are okay with having fun looking like a jackass and non FPS titles), get it.  If not then don't sell a kidney, but definitely play with one for a while if possible and judge for yourself.",,False,self,t5_2qhk2,True,,,True,t3_e1mpm,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/e1mpm/kinect_first_impressions/,

It isn't a premium theme (i.e. no custom ""My friends"" backgrounds and whatnot), but it isn't too shabby and I had fun looking around for images and customizing em a little. It was decent enough to replace my Aqua Teen Hunger premium theme I have had forever, and I like the main screen. 

Directions are simple, but you need a flash drive **converted into an Xbox storage device** or some way to hook up your HDD to a computer. 

**FOR BEST RESULTS (read: easier)** you should copy or move a theme onto the flash drive by (on the Xbox) going to System Settings-Memory-Hard Drive-Themes. Select one and copy it onto the flash drive.

Go to Gamecrave.net's [download page](http://gamecrave.net/?page_id=2) and download USB Explorer. Unzip it and run it, it should try to update (which I allowed, it takes about 3 seconds) and v44 should open up.

Select File-Open USB drive manually (or if it is the only external storage device select ""first USB Drive"") and navigate Data Partition-Content-FFFE07D1-000300000 (this is the theme location, you should see your theme(s) displayed) and drag the Reddit theme into it.

I am not sure how to make premium themes, I am assuming you have to have some deal or license with Xbox. As far as the avatar goes I am no whiz at making models and doing what would be required. I am sure if we contact the Reddit staff and ask them for permission/help it would get the ball rolling. I would love a little reddit alien running around, or hell even a reddit t-shirt would be cool!

Enjoy, and if you have any questions I will try to help! I can change some of the colors around on the bottom if anyone would like me to also.

But guess what? This is /r/Xbox360, not /r/MicrosoftFanBoy. I don't give a shit about next-gen, I'm all about right fucking now-gen. And right now, I'm excited as hell to own an Xbox 360. Let's recap all the positives for the 360 right now, especially in light of today...

* Cost of new system = ZERO. I already own a 360, I don't have to shell out $399, $499, or Potato.

* FREE GAMES. Two free games every month for the rest of the year. That's twelve games and I, for one, am excited. i haven't played Assassin's Creed 2 or Halo 3 and i probably haven't played the others we're going to get. If you have? Great, good excuse to replay a classic for nothin'.

* WORLD OF TANKS! Do I know what it is? No! Does it look crazy fun? Yes! And it's free this summer for the Xbox 360.

* Remember that amazing looking game at the beginning of the E3 presentation, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain? Yeah, I want it too. And I'm going to buy it since it's ALSO BEING RELEASED FOR THE XBOX 360. 

* Grand Theft Auto V, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Watch Dogs, Assassins Creed IV, Lost Planet 3, etc. There is still A TON of amazing games coming to the 360, it is not a dead console.

* Last but not least, FUCK YOU NSA. I can unhook the Kinect on this console. And even if I leave it plugged in, you can only spy on me in low-res, bitches.

Honestly there's a lot of crap on TV; I feel like half of what you're paying for with cable is reality shows now and IMHO all that crap's a waste of airtime. Important news I can get online or maybe even with the few channels you get by default. Sports (this would be more for guests since I don't watch) would mostly be covered by the ESPN app, and Netflix and Hulu Plus have pretty great selection of physical and streaming content. Hulu in particular is great since you can view recent episodes - this pretty much seals the deal for me.

1) Consoles don't get banned just for fun. The enforcement side of Xbox Live takes things very seriously and investigates things THOROUGHLY. All evidence resulting in a console ban is logged, you can complain all you want but you can't get unbanned.

2) Xbox Live support can't help you. They aren't the same group of people who ban consoles and they can't unban you. The enforcers don't talk to them either.

3) There are only three things that result in a console ban, you can find them here: http://www.xbox.com:80/en-US/consoleban

Modifying the hardware to play pirated games.

Trying to phish for personal information.

Repeated offenses that resulted in account bans (offering to sell access to hacked Call of Duty forums for example).

After being downvoted in multiple threads over making this claim, I decided to make this thread. MKV files CAN be played on your XBOX using Windows Media Center IF you have the right codecs installed on your computer. 

I am a long time user of [VLC Media Player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) which supports the following file types listed [here](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.html). It will install all the codecs for the filetypes listed there on your computer, but you will still have to set up streaming through WMC.

Keep in mind that even with the right codecs installed, the XBOX **does not** natively support filetypes such as MKV and you will have issues with rewinding/forwarding where the file will freeze. You will have to restart WMC in order to get the file to work again. A small inconvenience for the ability to watch ""your"" movie files.

**KEEP IN MIND you are only transcoding the file for it to be playable on your 360.**

As has been mentioned in the thread there are some alternatives to using WMC+VLC. You can download [CCCP](http://www.cccp-project.net/) as an alternative to obtain the codecs. You can use the following streaming services: [PS3 Media Server](http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/), [TVersity](http://tversity.com/), [Transcode 360](http://en.kioskea.net/download/download-2307-transcode-360), [Plex](http://www.plexapp.com/), etc.

You can also plug a flash drive into your TV if it has a USB input or even use external media servers like AppleTV, Roku, etc.

Long story short, I actually found a website that these ""hackers"" sell the accounts on.  I put my gamertag in the SEARCH box and low and behold a post showed up with a picture of my account and said:  Selling Legit 10 Year Tenure! PROOF and my jaw dropped.  I have called M$ with this new information, but I dont really feel that they will help me too much.  What the hell else can I do?

I created an account to tell everyone he stole it, but most just laughed and called me a KID.  Reported it to mods with no answers.

My apartment got robbed a few months ago and a friend just sent me a text asking if I got a new XBOX since I was logged-on playing COD: Black Ops.

When it was stolen I called XBOX support immediately and cancelled my account, removed the credit card, and explained what had happened. 

I just signed into my xbox account online and found out that whoever has it has indeed been playing Black Ops as recently as a few hours ago. They've also been playing a few other games. 

I just want to know if there is anything I can do other than just sending them a very rude message. 

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

With me on this post is /u/tomliness. We're simply trying to see if there is enough interest in our idea, and if there is, we will make another post officially starting the competition. If there is enough interest beyond this first month, we will eventually require a small entry fee so we can provide better prizes.


Since January 2012, we've held a monthly Gamerscore competition between a few friends. We're aware that Microsoft tracks a few stats for you, but we wanted more detail. So though it's a crude way to stat track, we created an Excel spreadsheet that allows us to easily compare our progress.


We recently came up with the idea of expanding our competition, and that's where you all come into play. We figured this sub would be the best place to start. So if there is enough interest, we will hold a competition during the month of July. The final rules have yet to be determined, but here is an overview of what we've discussed so far.



* You can play any games that you want, DLC add-ons, Arcade games, anything.

* No new Gamertags/accounts. You have to use existing ones. This is to avoid players who will start from scratch to unlock every achievement at their disposal.

* When you unlock achievements, Xbox.com puts time stamps on them. They tend to be a little slow with these numbers, but since it is the easiest way to keep track of everyone's info, we will use the dates they provide. Pro tip, don't wait until the final hour on July 31st to unlock achievements.


**1^st Place - Most Achievements Unlocked** [ you win a game of your choice up to the standard retail value of $60 ]
It's too easy to get a high Gamerscore, but is adequately difficult to unlock a high number of achievements. The person who unlocks the most achievements wins the top prize.

**2^nd Place - Highest Gamerscore** [ you win a $20 Microsoft Points card ]
This is fairly straightforward. Get the highest Gamerscore, and you win second prize.

**3^rd Place** [ ??? ]
We haven't yet decided on how to win 3rd place, or what you will win. It will most likely end up being a random stat, such as who unlocks the most achievements worth 5 points. Something along those lines.



Leave comments to let us know if you are interested. If anyone has any suggestions or ideas, please feel free to talk about that as well, though we reserve the right to keep things as they are. We will most likely allow 20-30 participants, unless of course there is a huge turnout.

Mods of /r/xbox360, if there is a problem with any of this, please let us know. If we are cool to do this, but you want proof or need to work with us to ensure its legitimacy, that's fine too.


**EDIT**

During the next week, /u/tomliness and I will finalize the rules. If you have any more ideas, post them here or message us. We will submit a new post one week from today that will serve as the official entry to the competition.

Now since you all showed such enthusiasm today, I will message each of you during the following week, most likely in the next day or two. Everyone here is entered in the tournament, provided you respond to me with your information. If you don't get back to me by next Sunday, you'll have to enter again. For now, all we will require is your reddit username and Xbox Gamertag. If you end up winning, we'll need more information so you can receive your prizes.

Right now, you don't have much reason to believe we will follow through with this. You can check our Gamertags; (I am Gisinator15 and /u/tomliness is Killer Neo). We also won't be directly participating, so don't worry, we're not going to win your prizes. We will also message the mods during the week and provide any proof they require so that you all know we're serious about the competition.

Thanks to everyone for showing such interest! We're excited to get this thing up and running in the next couple of weeks.


**EDIT 2 on June 17**

The turnout was bigger than we thought, so unfortunately, not everyone will be entered. If you already posted your gamertag, no worries, you're in. If you simply said you're interested, I will message you tomorrow. If you get back to me with your gamertag, you'll be entered in a raffle (we'll video ourselves randomly selecting so you can see we're not screwing anyone over). We are going to allow 35 participants, and /u/tomliness and I are not included.

I also messaged the mods and am waiting to hear back from them, just to make sure they're ok with this, or if they want proof. So let's just say it's all ago, and this first July works out well. Odds are we'll look to expand, and a lot of people mentioned trueachievements.com, so we might look to them for some help with stat tracking. But that's looking too far into the future for now.

So check tomorrow for messages in your reddit inbox, and be on the lookout this Sunday for the next post concerning official rules and participants!

The first ""experiment"" is a series of network tests. After the program has run for a specified amount of time, an avatar award (and a zero point achievement) will immediately unlock:

30 minutes - Lab Technician (0 G) - Lab Coat
One hour - Senior Research Analyst (0 G) - Brain Helmet
Six hours - Mad ""360"" Scientist (0 G) - Crazy Wig

The LIVE Labs app can be downloaded and accessed from the My Community tab.

The amount of testing time is cumulative; the program can be closed and restarted when convenient. No specifics are given as to the amount of packets sent, but I was able to chat in a party without any loss in audio quality.

This promotion runs from March 10th until March 27th.

I put the disc in and it makes 2 buzzing sounds about 1 second apart. Then it says 'Unable to Read Disc'. I did the 'Hit it to get it to work' method. I found when I hit the top of the xbox directly above where the center of the disc would be that it would load...but I had to time it just right in between the buzzes for it to work. 

After that quit working, I bought a laser disc cleaner. It did nothing. Same 'Unable to read' message. I then found a tutorial talking about taking the xbox apart and cleaning out the Disc Drive. I dismantled it, took out the Disc Drive, dismantled that, cleaned the laser with a q-tip (it looked completely clean before I did anything), then moved all the components around to make sure nothing was hung up, then put it all back together. For a few glorious minutes, it started playing games again....but then it stopped. 

I put the laser disc cleaner in and it started to run, so I went through the CD and let it run in its entirety. I then put a game in, and it started loading and then said, 'Unable to read disc'. 

I went through the hitting it method again, and ultimately gave up. It's back to how it was. I'm sure the buzzing sound that occurs means something, but if someone knows exactly what and could help me that would be Amazing. Hope to have it fixed before his Birthday Party Saturday.

When it started, you had to use IE on a Windows computer and install the ""Bing Bar,"" but now it appears to be open for everyone on any OS with any browser, with no required toolbar installs.

The way it works is you get a couple points for clicking on their bing reward search terms of the day (is how I will phrase it, I don't know what they're actually called, or if they have a name), and a few more for doing any number of random searches on Bing.  I got 250 for registering a new email address, and then an extra 26 for clicking their links.

You can use these reward points to purchase things from their store, one item happens to be 400 Microsoft Points, which costs 500 Bing credits.  So, after the initial 250 points, and 26 per day (when I used it before, the reward values were different on different days, and there were some bonus points they threw out from time to time), you can get 400 free points in just over a week.  And after that, just under three weeks can get you 400 more points.

It's tedious and takes a while to remember to do it each day, but I did it with two accounts last time they offered this and got over 1000 free microsoft points and bought some nice XBLA games and some DLC.

I'm not getting anything by telling you about this, and I have to absolutely stress that I'm not affiliated with this in any way other than getting some free microsoft points every couple weeks for clicking some links.

If you don't want to do it, don't.  I don't care.  If you're interested, http://www.bing.com/rewards/signup/web is the place to go (notice that's a plain link to their website, not some extended referral link).  You'll need a windows live account, but I'm sure you're all tech savvy enough to create a junk email account for this purpose if you want to.

This sounds like some sort of paid ad, and I hate that.  I just love free xbox points and figured you guys would, too.",,False,self,t5_2qhk2,False,,,True,t3_i12ew,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/i12ew/free_xbox_points_youre_willing_to_jump_through/,

|**Unique Daily Users**|Over 1.3K|

* **7000+** confirmed trades, with countless others that go unconfirmed. 

* That's 14,000+ games finding a new home without the use of coins, without getting ripped off by brick and mortars, without losing a percentage to online vendors.  For the price of shipping and materials, you take a game you have but don't play/want, and turn it into a whole new gaming experience. 

_____________________________________________


We've grown from a subreddit of a couple hundred that completed ~20 trades/month to a subreddit with thousands of users, that completes over 250 trades a month. That's 500+ games that no one takes a percentage from, that's 500+ games that are sent from one redditor to another without a monetary transaction. 

We deal in mostly physical games that are traded for physical games.  Why that limitation? Because when digital trades became prominent in our subreddit they were spun off into /r/steamgameswap.  

Do we offer the ability to *sell* games for cold hard paypal?  No. Why?  Because there's already a subreddit for that - /r/gamesell. 

Live outside of US or Canada?  You can post in /r/gameswap without limitations.  We have a few UK swappers, but there's also /r/gameswapUK. There are also other country-specific subreddits listed in our sidebar. 

For those who like collecting things, we have a flair system.  Complete one trade, earn a blue mushroom. 10 trades, red mushroom and so on. 200+ trades earns you the pinnacle of Zelda - the Tri-force.

There are some rules, and they are listed in our sidebar as well as the [FAQ/wiki.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/faq#from-tab) 

Why make this post?  To inform reddit that you don't need to leave reddit to find a great place to swap games.

I was playing the Ghost Recon: Future Soldier Beta. As some may have noticed, there have been some Ubisoft server issues, with this, there has also been freezing issues in the main menu.

The game froze for me as well in the main menu. I waited for about two minutes and nothing happened. I turned off my Xbox 360 S. The screen on my TV was still showing the main menu. I turned my TV off and then back on and the main menu was still visible, then I turned my Xbox 360 back on with no luck as well. I left and came back around fifteen minutes later and the main menu is *still* there.

I repeated the TV on/off method and with no success, I then resorted to unplug my Xbox 360 from the power while it has been off for fifteen minutes. This fixed the problem. The main menu was no longer there and was blank.

I did not turn my Xbox 360 back on for around 24 hours. When I did, it was acting like a brand new Xbox. Zero accounts were found, all the launch videos, game demos, and such were there, when I have deleted them long ago. *Everything* else was gone. Not only was all the content deleted from my hard drive, but it seem to have reset as well.

I then tried to recover my account and I repeatedly received the error code ""8007945D"". I recovered my account on another hard drive and console, but the other hard drive has no hope whatsoever, all from unplugging it after it froze 20 minutes earlier.

So be careful when your Xbox 360 freezes along with the screen, and wait until it goes away no matter how long it takes, or your Xbox will may be reset and all of your content will be completely wiped.",,False,self,t5_2qhk2,True,,,True,t3_t012d,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/t012d/warning_accidently_wiped_6_years_of_content_off/,

So recently I set up an XBox to run a Minecraft server 24/7.  I started it just for some friends but then I decided to open it up to Reddit and so far have had quite a bit of interest in it.  Basically it's a server when you can do/build whatever you want so long as you're not harassing another player and not harming an existing creation.  We've had a lot of cool stuff built so far, so you can just check it out if you want, or grab some blocks out of the community warehouse and start building.   If you're interested, just send a friend request to the gamertag ""No Circles"".  

**EDIT:** Wow, got a bunch of friend requests on the account.  I just added everybody and invited a bunch of people in.  Sorry, I'm at work right now so I can't play or show anyone around.  Basically I just threw together a bunch of strangers on an unfamiliar map.  Let's see what happens.  
**EDIT2:** Ugh... had about 6 people on, tried to save and it froze. :(  Seems to be a continuing problem, I've tried about three different XBoxes but it seems to be an issue with the game.

 I am giving away Portal 2 in a random drawing.
Open to redditors in the United States only, it keeps things easier for me if I don't have to mail the game internationally.
Process:
Please reply to the ""Free To Enter"" comment thread to enter the drawing. You can tell a funny joke or creatively beg but it won't make a difference as the winner will be determined by the fickle fate of randomness. I will remove duplicate entries, so please be kind and try not to ""game"" this. Once again, please be sure to reply to the ""Free To Enter"" comment thread to enter, I will not comb through the other comment threads or direct comments to this post
On Friday, 6/29 at 9 pm Pacific, I will take all the names that responded to the ""Free To Enter"" comment thread and throw them against a random number generator in Excel. The redditor with the lowest number will win the game.
I will announce the winner on this post. I will also PM the winner and ask for their mailing address so I can mail the game to them. I will only mail the game within the United States.
Thanks for playing and good luck!

Wow... was I wrong... But instead of writing it off and turning it over to my 14 year old (who I should say, loves the game and more or less finished it in 3 hours), I felt an obligation to tell the developers where they went wrong. If we, as players, don't demand better games then we will never get them.

Games are supposed to be fun. I think we can agree on that. I'm ok with a game giving me an objective, heck, I EXPECT games to give me an objective. I'm even OK with timed missions, though I'm not a fan, It can be exciting barely getting something done just as the clock runs out.

Where the developers went wrong was in letting the clock determine who wins and who loses instead of the players. Take the very first mission... I played as a revolutionary and had to guard a door for a set period of time... that's easy enough. Done. OK, next mission... kill an operative that the Security team is trying to escort... Done. Wait... he's not dead? Because the other team respawned and revived him. Ok. I can deal with that. Dead. No, wait, he's back again. Dead. God-damn it! I killed him within the time restraint, why...

Oh.

See as long as the clock is running the mission isn't over. In some weird sense of ""fairness"" the other team keeps getting chances to continue the escort mission even though I've already killed them all lots and lots of times. My actions don't decide who wins, nor do my opponents, it's all on the clock. It would be like having a fighting game with a three minute clock, but it doesn't matter how many times you KO the other character in 3 minutes, all that matters is who has the most health or is still standing when the clock runs out.

Here's a tip - forcing your players into doing the same god-damned task over and over again IS NOT FUN. Games are supposed to be fun, you break that rule and you break the game, it's pretty much that simple. When the very first mission makes the player want to rage quit because of a broken play mechanic you have a broken game.

What took me a long time to realize is why I thought the game would be better. I attended PAX, I saw the demo, heck, I even got to interview the Splash Damage crew for a gaming blog. How could it have gone wrong from what I was shown? Easy. When they showed us missions in the demo, they only finished the missions once. When they accomplished something, they were done, they moved on to show us someting else. They didn't tell us that you'd have to sit there playing it over and over until the clock ran out.

That's not only the flaw in the game, it's disingenuous. 

The heartbreaking part for me is that I WANTED to like the game so bad. I like the art and design. I like the story, which could work very well as a science fiction novel or Mad Max style movie. When I'm playing a game though, I want to feel like I've accomplished something and having everything I've done be reversed 5 or 10 seconds after I've done it and having to re-do it again and again and again isnt't fun. It's frustrating and it blows and I'm done with the game now.

People are talking about the DLC and how the game can be fixed... the problem as I see it though is that the game was purposely built this way. You can't remove the clock without being fair to both sides of an objective. I guess you could do it the old fashioned way... instead of a timer for those doing the escort, you give them three respawns to get to the exit, meaning that the opposing team only has to kill their target three times instead of a more or less infinite number. Maybe have a difficulty option which allows you to set the number of re-spawns before mission failure or something.

In any case, I hope Brink II doesn't suffer from the same issues. There is huge potential here, it's just poorly executed.",,False,self,t5_2qhk2,False,,flair-gamertag,True,t3_i9hq8,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/i9hq8/brink_want_my_30_back/,

A few days after my post a brand new slim Xbox arrived at my door along with Halo ODST courtesy of rhodesman, for which I couldn't be more grateful. I replaced my door and have a new security system in place. Some good news is the police informed us that they have a suspect as someone tried to pawn one of my tools at a pawn shop very close to my house, I guess it pays to record your serial numbers. 

I'm not really sure what happens next in a case like this but the police told us it would take some time for anything to come of it, that if they act now it would be a misdemeanor but if they can get more out of him they can bump up the charges, so I guess it's a wait and see.

It's December tomorrow, and there's no more AAA releases, so the year is pretty much done as far as new releases go. 

So, here are the categories: 

**Action/Adventure** (i.e., Batman: AC, AC:R, Portal 2, LA Noire, Dead Space 2)

**Shooter/FPS** (i.e., BF3, GoW3, MW3, Crysis 2, Halo CEA)

**RPG** (i.e., Skyrim, Saint's Row 3, Dark Souls, etc.)

**Strategy/RTS** (i.e., Tropico 4, Toy Soldiers: Cold War, etc.)

**Arcade/Casual** (XBLA games, like Bejewled 2, You Don't Know Jack, Resident Evil: Code Veronica X, etc.)

**Sports/Racing** (Madden 12, FIFA 12, Forza 4, F1 2011)

**Indie Game** (Best user-created Indie game, i.e., Solar 2)

**Kinect Game** (Best use of Kinect; i.e., Kinectimals, Kinect Sports 2, Forza 4, Child of Eden, etc.)

**Other** (Anything that doesn't fit in the above categories)

and:

**Overall Best Game**  Your choice for the overall best game, regardless of category. 

Feel free to suggest category changes/additions/deletions.  **Note that some games (Saint's Row, Toy Soldiers, etc.) will certainly fit into more than one category, and that's perfectly OK.**

Some good friends said they had one, and I got the box of stuff from them the other day.  Turns out its NOT a Xbox.. its an Xbox 360. Its got a couple of sports games, A Call of Duty game, wireless controller, a couple of other things..  Needless to say I'm blown away by the generosity. 

The problem is I know ZIP about Xbox 360 games. I play a little bit of stuff on the Wii, but mostly I'm a PC gamer. MMO's and such. I have played old versions of HALO on the PC and I'm looking at getting a copy of that for us for Christmas.

What games should I get that are suitable for a 9yr old?

* Edit: Thanks very much for all the suggestions! Generally we're not cool w/ my son playing a lot of FPS games like Call of Duty, even though he &gt;loves&lt; zombie mode for the one Call of Duty game he has. We generally limit his use of it, but allow him to play the other Wii games such as the various Lego series and other kids games.

Suggestions so far: (And for him I've listed what I think looks most interesting from looking stuff up online)
#
* HALO? - We're going to keep an eye on this one, I know he'll be stoked to play it.
* Ilomilo 
* Portal 2 
* Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts
* Lego Series (Batman, HP, SW, LoTR)
* Sonic
* Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts
* Castle Crashers 
* Minecraft (we have this on the PC and he loves it, can you mix &amp; match online w/ Xbox play?)
* Lost Odyssey
* Forza Horizon
* Skate 3
* VIVA PINATA
* Toy Story 3
* Marvel Ultimate Alliance 1 and 2. (So far he just doesn't seem to be interested in fighting games)

Downloads:
# 
* Beautiful Katamari
* Banjo-Kazooie 1 &amp; 2
* Fancy Pants Adventures.
* Aegis Wing
* Doritos Crash Course

And for the restricted Dad Only shelf:
#

Edit X2! Thanks so much for all the suggestions! Its much appreciated!

Edit X3: Not that anyone is reading this anymore, but as an update:
I finally got the kids out of the house for a bit, and set up the 360 to check it out. Its the 120GB HD version. We've got all the cables, a headset, 1 wireless controller. The box has set up and run just fine and these are the games they gave us:
#
* Medal of Honor - Limited Edition
* Mass Effect 3
* Forza Motorsport 4
* Madden 12
* Goldeneye Reloaded
* Tiger Woods PGA 11

And they're sending over:

You can find that thread [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/jhinc/someone_compromised_my_gamertag_bought_4800/)

The first thing I did was check my online bank statement and Windows Live billing history. The guy who got in my account tried to use an out-of-date card to add over $100 worth of points to the account. Fortunately, I had recently replaced my card under unrelated circumstances.

Then, I called Microsoft to file a report in September (had just moved, couldn't call earlier). After all was said and done, they gave me a three-week ETA for a solution to the problem.

In November, I called for an update. I was told that the problem I was experiencing, having an account moved overseas, is rather difficult to solve, and its ETA is actually three months. So, she told me everything should be set and done in about a week, two weeks tops.

Just before Christmas, I called again. This time, I was a bit more forceful in demanding to know what was going on. The guy said he understood, but couldn't do anything - the recovery team is completely separate from his department, and cannot be reached by me, or anyone. Therefore, all he could do was update my report and hope someone got to it. I made sure to let him know it was somewhat ridiculous that not even he had a way to contact them before hanging up.

A week ago, I got an email in Portuguese saying my account had been moved from Brazil to the US. However, no fix yet.

And finally, this morning, I got an email, in English, telling me the problem has been fixed. They forgot to restore my list of friends, but whatever, it wasn't that long anyway.

The upside to all of this is that they gave me the codes for two free years of Live.

Yesterday, Best Buy put their ad online and it included 3-month Gold for $7.99. Now this included the actual cards themselves or the digital purchase from them, emailed to you.

I went into the store today and the cards were sold out. The manager of the department said to me ""follow me to this kiosk"" and he generated a ticket that was $24.99, but rang up as $7.99

He asked me ""You want 10? That's 30 months of Gold for $80.""

It made sense. But this is for an extra account (I'm paid up on the others). 

The good thing is that there's no limit here. Out of cards? Not your problem. Go to the kiosk. I was emailed my code - no problem. And the way I figure it, even if you're pretty awesome at snagging Live when amazon.com has got it for $40, that's still 24 months for $80 if you buy 2 of them. 

This is just such a good deal. I say go for it. I can't believe they didn't put a limit on. Maybe they will, which is why I'm advising you to hit it up ASAP.

Anyone have any horror stories yet?,TheWalterSobchak,50,6,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/gbcfg/how_are_the_new_360s_anyone_have_any_horror/,"The reason I ask is that my current box is breaking down, hard. It barely reads disks and it's laboring hard when I game, not to mention it's loud as hell and has scratched more than one disk (I've even opened it to clean the CD drive but I'm at the point of cleaning it everyday now at some point).

I'm looking to buy the new 250BG 360 (I heard they're super quiet?) and was wondering if anyone has had any issues with it yet? The old model was synonymous for breaking down and showing a RROD, I've been on 4, and hope they've got it nailed on this new model.

So, how's your new 360 treating you?
