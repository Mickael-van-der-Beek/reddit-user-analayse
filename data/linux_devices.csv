Here's the deal: I have this USB sound card, a Focusrite Sapphire 6 to be precise that I would very much like to use. Unfortunately, I spend almost no time on Windows anymore, and also unfortunately Linux does not support it. I have looked all over for another driver/ solution with no luck.

My current plan is to buy a USB DAC when I can afford it, but I was curious how one might go about writing a driver? I am a computer engineering student (undergrad) so this sort of work is actually very relevant and interesting to me, I am just not sure what it would take. I imagine it would take a ton of work at low levels, but again, would love some more info as I may be making my own devices down the road and it couldn't hurt to learn on something I would actually use personally. 

Thanks for the listen and help. And if this is a totally stupid question, just downvote/ flame me accordingly, I'm just learning after all!

&gt;Braddock Gaskill gave a wonderful presentation on an open source 8-bit computer he had created.

&gt;... we started to chat about both the Humane Reader &amp; Humane PC.

&gt;The Humane Reader can be used as an ebook reader and comes with a 2GB SD card where you can put about 5000 ebooks or, roughly, the entire contents of Wikipedia. This allows anyone to bring a 5000 book library or all of Wikipedia into a home or school that does not have access to internet content. One of the main features he wanted was hackability.

&gt;... Braddock is shooting for a price point of $20US for the Humane Reader!

&gt;There is also the Humane PC which allows you to hack on a smaller scale which uses an 8-bit microcomputer.

This whole setup should be hidden in a neat box with as few cables as possible to the outside. Basic requirements for the setup:

* WiFi (preferably 802.11*n*): It won't be placed near our router/no possibility of pulling ethernet cables

* Sound card w/ speaker or headphone out. 

* USB for connecting to the HDD. 

* no fan/noise

* Power consumption low enough to be on 24/7 (&lt; 10W)

* Suitable for general fucking around, like running a wiki for the flat or something.

* (see above) preferably running an established linux distro w/ good package management

I have two ideas for this: 

1. Beagleboard + USB Wifi Dongle. Seem to land at ~ €200 for the whole solution (already have the HDD)

2. hackable WiFi router converted to general purpose-computer, with USB sound card. Should perhaps be cheaper since most routers are &lt; €100 these days.

Any ideas? It seems like SheevaPlugs are unsuited for this because of http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_devices/comments/dk556/nanonote_or_sheevaplug/ (also, no WiFi nor sound card).

Following is the post made on the linux board:

I know this might be a little picky since it has absolutely no mas appeal for general people but I'd though I'd ask if anyone ever came across such product.

Basically some sort of really basic device that fits in the pocket with slide keyboard that linux could run on terminal only (with what's essential for building softwares). Having wireless internet also. Most of these kind of products come with touchscreen which wouldnt be a problem but the usual problem is the price.Something along the line of the N810 from nokia (way too overpriced imo tho).

Mostly looking to refine my terminal skills and I'd just love to carry a device like that around. Of course the processor will have to be arm for that type of device.

",Bulldogg658,12,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_devices/comments/19dwfl/pogo_plug_as_web_server_is_it_a_sensible_option/,"
I used to have a website up as basically an online portfolio for my photography, which meant I didn't get nearly enough visitors to justify the $4 a month it was costing to host. I know its possible to use a pogo plug as a web server, but I only see a few how-to’s and very little else about it. Is there a reason that its not a popular option? 

The second part of my question is, is this an unrealistic thing for a novice to try? I'm a little better than average at figuring things out, but have no education in programming or anything related. Even my old website was just a hack job using the photoshop slice tool (though good looking I'll have you know). I managed to get it all working before with go daddys interface but without something like that I might be lost.

I know there are some legal issues but tha'ts exactly WHY a DIY hacked version would be so great becuase no inspector can see inside the ECU.

The problem withold ECU's and replacement sis

1.They are expensive for what they are.
2.they are programmed to not allow your mileage increasing hacks or adjustments. They actively counteract many things you do with aricher gas mixture so being able to fine tune your o2 sensor to not react as if there is incomplete complete just because your hydrogen o2 unit addon is making the tail pipe more 02 rich while lowering emissions would be a real benefit.

You could also make your programmable DIY car ECU do lots of other great engine monitoring logging etc and even put other chips inside to make it a real computer with an in dash display etc.

It has a USB 3.0 port, Wireless AC draft (not that I need it). Sadly, it's not yet compatible with Tomato or DD-WRT.

Hello everyone. Even though I'm a CS major and keep an eye on several different technologies, the single board computers have slipped by. Since I lack the knowledge, and there are hundreds of different boards out there, I have come to you for help.

What I want to do is set up my external hard drives so that they can be accessed via my network and by SSH. I have 2x external drives totaling 2.5 TB and one of those is USB 3.0. I have a wireless cable modem that is unfortunately only 10/100 Mb/s without a USB port, and I have a gigabit switch connecting my laptop and desktop. Both computers are dual booted Ubuntu/Win 7.

I looked into the Raspberry Pi and was told that even if I purchased a USB gigabit adapter, the Pi couldn't handle the full 480 Mb/s. 

I realize that I can't break 100 Mb/s through SSH, which is fine with me, but I want to be able to access my storage without having to boot up my PC while at home. It wouldn't be a problem if running my desktop didn't raise the temperature in my tiny apartment by ~5° F.

Does anyone have any ideas for a board under $200 that could do this?

6. Housing/casing so I don't have to build my own case for it.
7. In-stock now, can't wait for pre-order
8. Power-adapter would be nice to have.

Don't need:

1. USB2 or above
2. Fast CPU/GPU
3. More than 128MB RAM
4. HDMI/DVI/VGA
5. Wifi

The entire job of each PC is to run: ""nc -l -p 8000"" so that data from stdin fed by a keyboard wedge (USB) device can be read by a remote app. The data will be a few bytes per second and would be no different than a human typing away on a USB keyboard.

I went through [this list](http://raymii.org/cms/p_Small_Linux_PCs_overview) and am not sure if any of them will work. SheevaPlug doesn't seem to have wired Ethernet and I don't want to get into custom JTAG development stuff. Raspberry PI and [ODROID](http://www.hardkernel.com/renewal_2011/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G133999328931) don't have cases, don't come pre-installed, don't have persistent storage, and are on back-order. I don't want to go Arduino low-level on this and write USB HID driver code. CottonCandy, Gooseberry don't have Ethernet. I've seen a few MK802/3 devices on AliExpress.com but don't know how reliable they are.

[CuBox](http://solid-run.com/cubox) appears to be the closest match to my requirements but it has lot more CPU/RAM/graphics than I need and goes over $100. I would rather give up on these features that aren't necessary for my usage and get a lower price. I might end up buying 10-20 of these devices in the next month and maybe a lot more in the future.

I appreciate any suggestions. Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2rfd8,False,,,True,t3_13wikb,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_devices/comments/13wikb/any_recommendations_for_a_tiny_linux_pc_with_usb/,

I love all these suggestions!  Well done all!  If you want to open a boutique, feel free to grab one of these fine names, **but please reward the contributor**!!

Hello all.  I'm not quite sure if this post is appropriate for this forum, as I am not sharing new of anything, but am instead asking for feedback.  I'm looking for cloud naming for a MK808 store, selling [these](http://i.imgur.com/iCokx.jpg).  (*These are **unbranded**, and I have a shipment on the way from a factory in China.*)  

If you can pick out a name that we end up using, I would be very happy to send you one of these great little devices as a small token of thanks, or PayPal you the cost if that is what you'd prefer.

In any case, please allow me to first describe this product, and then my future store.  I am looking to sell these striking devices for a bit less than what you'd find elsewhere.  I live in San Diego, and would take advantage of inexpensive USPS priority shipping to allow me to offer free shipping within the US.  I plan to sell the devices for between $60 and $65, delivered.

Here are the specs, if you are curious:

***

**Hardware**								
CPU	RockChip 3066, up to 1.6GHz, Cortex A9, dual-core CPU + four-core GPU							
Memory	 1G DDR3							
Flash	Nand Flash 8GB  							
WiFi	 802.11 b/g /n							
**Bluetooth	 BT2.1**	&lt;-- hard to find in a MK808 today!						
Mould	Metal: Silver, black or red (samples random)							
I/O	1*HDMI 1.3		up to 1920x1080 resolution					
	1*USB OTG		one OTG port to support USB device					
	1*USB HOST		Host USB port 					
	1*USB 		USB Power supply 					
	1*TF card reader		Micro SD card interface, max to 32GB					
Power	                   100~220V AC Input, 5V 2A DC Output 							
Accessories	HDMI cable							
	Power adapter							
	BT / 2.4G wireless Keyboard &amp; Mouse (optional)							

**Software**								
OS	Google Android 4.1							
Video	RM/RMVB, MPEG, MKV, AVI, MP4, MOV, FLV, H.263, H.264, VC-1, DivX, Xvid, TS, RealVideo, VP6, VP8  up to 1080P support							
Audio	AAC-LC/HEAAC/HE-AAC v2, AC3, AMR-NB, DTS, MP3, OGG, RA_COOK, WMA, WMA, LPCM/PCM/ADPCM, FLA							

***

By the way, I've been told the aluminum case conducts heat excellently, so that no vents are required. 

I'm looking for store name which is **fun** and almost childish, and appeals especially to young men and young women.  The kind of people who frequent Reddit and ICHC.  Eventually, I will probably beg [Dilraj Mann](http://dilrajmann.blogspot.com/) for more custom work for the theme, as I love his work and his style.  We'll see how that goes.  But as you can imagine, the site would not resemble a Linux ARM boutique than you've seen before.  I am very concerned about hitting the female (and adventurous men) market with new pink MK808's, for example.

SO, in any case.  I'd love to hear your thoughts.  And thanks for your time all.

**EDIT: just to be clear, I am not promising that I will choose an idea below as a winner.  I have my own ideas, and if I don't hear an idea that I like better, then my idea will be what I stay with.  I hope I haven't misled anyone.**

I'd like to briefly describe a product for you, and I'd love to know whether you feel that you would be interested in purchasing this product.  Using your valuable feedback, I would have a much better feel for the viability of a planned Ecommerce store.

I don't know if this question is appropriate for this subreddit.  If it isn't, please let me know I will remove this thread.  If you can also direct me to the appropriate location, I would appreciate that a lot.

The flagship product would be an Android Mini PC, specifically [this MK808](http://www.amazon.com/MK808-Android-Rockchip-RK3066-Cortex-A9/dp/B009OX22B4).  I would be reselling this product (*and similar*) after purchasing large quantities direct from the manufacturer **China**.  In addition, I'd sell common attachments such as a USB-to-LAN adapter, USB-to-SATA adapter, HDMI-to-DVI-D custom Android ROM flashing, pre-installed Linux distros on SD cards, micro keyboards, remote/mouse,  etc.

Why MK808?  This particular product is great for home theater, desktop, and server usage.  It is a great tool, and very inexpensive.  It draws very little power.  A great computer for the masses.

Allow me to restate the specifications on this product and give a price:

* Processor: 1.6GHz Rockchip RK3066 Cortex-A9 dual core (*perhaps Amlogic as its more open, or Allwinner later, but definitely dual or quad core*)
* GPU: Quad core Mali-400MP
* RAM: 1GB DDR3
* Storage: Nand Flash 8GB
* Video Out: micro HDMI
* WiFi: 150M 802.11 b/g/n (internal antenna)
* Ethernet: no
* Memory card reader: microSD (Linux bootable)
* System on a Chip: Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)
* Size: 4.0 in. x 1.5 in.
* Audio: Integrated
* Ports: 1 x USB 2.0 Host, 1 X HDMI1.3 Output, 1 x Micro-SD card slot, 1 X charger(mini USB) interface
* Power: 90-230V,50/60Hz input, max. power: 30W, Output: 5V/2A
* Price (free USPS Priority shipping in US): **$58.99** (7.75% tax in CA)

So, do you feel that you would want to purchase that product at the price quoted?  Do you have ideas for upsells that you would like to share?   Are there low-cost &amp; fun enhancements that you would like to see from such a store that you are not seeing in other stores selling a MK80x product?

For a project at an NPO, I need to take care of a server hosting some data (100Gb Subversion repo + some Java application). As I need a relatively cheap yet durable solution, I had been looking to popular Linux-powered NAS solutions. Is this a good choice, or should I spend the extra money and go for a full-blown server?

As a test I've been playing with a Synology DS207+, which was quite nice (apart from having died on me). One issue however was that Synology's Linux isn't all that flexible, and ipkg didn't fulfil all my needs either. Hence my question, which (relatively recent) NAS can I run Debian on? Apart from the NSLU2 (which is too old and has no internal drive), I've found that some of the QNAP Turbo Stations support Debian, but there might be others that you guys know of.

Thanks!

I'd considered the MK802 and Raspberry Pi, but from most reports I've read, these are too slow for the web.

2. I think the new Samsung ARM Chromebook ($250) might be a good solution, but it's not available yet and it seems getting Ubuntu installed is [possible but complicated] (http://www.androidauthority.com/ubuntu-linux-arm-samsung-chromebook-125087/). The small SSD doesn't seem like an issue though, I think I could probably use an SD card for storage if needed.

3. The Ouya console looks like a good bet ($100, quad-core Tegra 3), but it won't be available until March.

4. There are also a new set of faster ARM-based USB dongles based on the Rockchip RK3066, the UG802 ($50-60) and MK808. There is a [developer] (http://liliputing.com/2012/11/developers-porting-ubuntu-linux-to-devices-with-rockchip-rk3066-processors.html) working on porting Linux for it, but it's not ready yet.

5. I might consider a x86 based system. I've been considering a barebones eeeBox style computer, but I'm not sure which one to go with. I'd prefer the system to be fanless, I'm not sure which x86 systems this is feasible on.

* Size doesn't matter.

* Connect to the router and access via SSH.

This system was built around a headless PC/104+ stack with an atom Z530 processor. We're looking to improve upon what I now know for the next generation and a different processor may work better. Not knowing much about the alternatives, I thought I'd ask here.

Power consumption is a big issue. We run 24/7 and it adds up over time, especially on cloudy days. While the atom doesn't draw much, it's much more powerful than we need. It is almost always running at 800 Mhz (it's lowest speed) with &lt; 10 % load. While PC/104+ is nice, it may not be the cheapest way to go. Here are our requirements:

Hardware:

* 8+ serial ports. RS422 support a plus. Most ports will be at 9600 baud.
* Ethernet (for connecting 3G modem with its own I/O)
* USB for WiFI, GPS, perhaps a webcam
* Analog and Digital I/O (14+ DO, 4+ DI, 4+ AI) (An Arduino?)
* 8GB+ onboard storage. We're using a SSD with a PCI-104 SATA controller card.  We tried a CF card on the PC/104 bus but it slowed down the ISA bus too much.
* Currently have 2GB RAM with no swap setup. Typically use 1.5 GB

Software:
Currently running Debian Squeeze and the following software:

* Python 2.6
* PostgreSQL 8.4 &amp; londiste(python)
* Java

I was looking at the Raspberry Pi which looks like it would work, but may be too much of step down in performance. It also has a bunch of things we don't need.

Against my advice, she setup a classroom with old dells that are now dilapidated and barely limping along.  The machines came with XP pre-installed (I assume illegally) and she doesn't have the software to rebuild them.  Spec-wise, they are at or below Windows 8 minimum requirements.

Hi, I have an HD3200 Radeon graphic card, it works excellent on ubuntu 11.10 with the fglrx_pci driver.

Last month I tried to upgrade to 12.10 or Fedora 17 and tried them both.
The driver used by default is xorg radeon which makes my computer overheats and very energy consuming, the battery last half it used to last.

So I tried to install fglrx only to find that it doesn't support the new version of xorg so I was given the options to downgrade xorg or keep the xorg driver.

I tried to downgrade xorg and install fglrx_legacy, doesn't heats that much (although heats more than with fglrx_pci) but it randomly crash. Some pages look like shit since the downgrade and it randomly crashes making the screen black and the keyboard unresponsive.

So I had to go back to U11.10.

Is there a solution for this? Or a solution being worked on?",,False,self,t5_2rfd8,False,,,True,t3_1663j5,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_devices/comments/1663j5/radeon_hd3200_and_xorg_overheating/,

I tried to partition my harddrive with bootcamp, went pretty well. Used rEFIt on my mac to switch between the systems once I got them working.

Tried to install Backtrack 5 R3 with a LiveCD, went mostly smooth except an error in the end claiming that Grub 2 could not be installed or something like that.

After the restart I can't boot into either Backtrack or OSX. I plop in the OSX install cd and try to see if I can save something. The patitions cannot be formatted. I mess around a bit with the disk utility tool and with restarting with both the OSX DVD and the Backtrack LIVECD. I then notice that my harddrive (The main partition that was there when I got my mac), has been replaced with some other one named disk01 or something. I made sure that I DID NOT format my main drive.

I have been searching everywhere on the internet, but can't seem to find a solution. Nothing works. (Tried all the safe boot bullshit, Don't know shit about Linux AT ALL.) Basically I've given up on getting my old mac back, and am now focusing on saving my School data if possible (2½ years of IMPORTANT NOTES i need for my finals)

My only possible idea left, is taking out the hard drive and putting it into my desktop to see if I can salvage any data. If not I'm just going to do a fresh reinstall of OSX and cry myself to sleep.


Is there anything you can help me do? If someone can make me get it as it used to be, I will be willing to pay you some over paypal.


I know I'm an idiot for not taking backups, but please help me.

Sincerely

an idiot.

Can someone please recommend a good small form factor device that has pretty good Linux support so that installing, booting, upgrading, maintaining, etc. aren't a nightmare?  Preferably the distro is also fairly mainstream.  I mainly have experience with Debian and RHEL flavors.
