I'll list examples.

Major Spoilers below: read with caution.

In the movie The Woodsman, Kevin Bacon's character spends 12 years in prison, then gets released and tries to get his life back.  There's a scene in the movie where he's sitting on a park bench, and a little girl is playing.  He starts talking to her, and I knew this was a cringe scene, so I turned the volume down like I always do at cringe scenes, and I was hoping for the best, but then he broke, and asked her if she wanted to sit on his lap.  The entire tone of the movie changed at that point.  You knew he did something terrible before, but now you witness his relapse.  

It's not a physical scene, just psychological. How did they get the girl to act that part, but not have some sort of trauma.  She probably knew in real life this was a bad situation, but now she had to act it out. 

Another one, was the movie Orphan. Isabelle Fuhrman was 12 when she played the role of Esther.  There's a part later in the movie where she tries to get all over Peter Sarsgaard's character(her adoptive father).  In the movie it turns out she was a much older woman who only looked young, so it made sense.  But she still tried to put the moves on an older man.  Again, how did this not affect everyone involved, or how DID it affect them.  She had to act it out with a very serious Actor who is much older than she is.  This isn't two 12 year olds kissing for the first time.

Last example, and most important one.  In the movie Trust, with Clive Owen, his daughter meets an online predator, meets him, and gets raped by her.  In the scene that precedes it, she models lingerie for the guy, and it's on film.  It is indeed, a little more risque than just a bikini too.  But then she sits on the bed and he starts to touch her stomach, but then he lays her down and starts to kiss her on the neck.  So this scene psychological, visual, and physical.  

She was 15 when she played the part of Annie.  So she is a bit more mature than the previously mentioned girls, and she seemed to handle it well, but still.  

Can anyone shed any light on this?

**Edit:  I want to take this time to thank everybody who joined in.  I love watching movies more than anything.  The only movies my ex-wife likes that are similar to mine are non-raunchy comedies and horror movies without sex scenes.  So it's a bit difficult to have these kinds of discussions with her.  I always like to think about what I watch and even if there is nobody around, I have small discussions in my head.**  

**It was pointed out that I seem to like fucked up movies.  This is true.  But these scenes aren't only in fucked up, obscure, perverted movies.  It's in mainstream film, as we pointed out.  It's in television on almost any channel.  It can be a drama(Trust), a horror film(The Exorcist and Orphan), or even a comedy(Pineapple Express).**

**These scenes can be for shock value, to help with understanding, to depict real-life events, or any other kind of reason.  But the sad truth is that these kind of events do happen in everyday life, in any culture, country, gender, and most important of all, any kind of person.  People we trust, people we have grown to love and respect, and obviously people we fear.**   

**I can't answer why this question stuck with me more than others, because I don't know.  But I felt it was an important issue, and I thank everyone involved in this discussion.  It helped me understand quite a bit more than I already did.**

It's not exactly my style of music, but I'm always down to check something out.

While watching I was trying to see what the conductor was really doing. I think the idea is that they are leading the musicians and keeping them all together. But what I couldn't help but think is that they'd be fine without him as well. The musicians are of course all amazing at their instruments, and were looking at their sheet music 99% of the time.

Finally, the last piece had a singer come out, and the conductor was behind her, so she was taking literally zero cue from him, which furthered my idea that, for these professional musicians, they could do without the guy up front with the little wand.

Yet the conductor always gets top billing, and their names are always quite well known (at least in those circles), leading me to question my questioning.

tl;dr Really, what does the conductor do? How important are they? And if you took the same orchestra, and switched conductors would anyone notice?

1376591565.0,189,self.answers,1kfnfk,Can anyone help me understand this bizarre sensation I can induce in my body?,FadieZ,233,44,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/1kfnfk/can_anyone_help_me_understand_this_bizarre/,"Ever since I can remember, I can create this ""sensation"" at will. It's very, very hard to explain to someone who has never felt it so I will try to go into as much detail as possible.

The sensation usually starts in my lower back, where it seems like I am VERY, VERY lightly contracting a muscle in that region. For a similar effect, try getting to the point where you flex your quadriceps JUST before they start flexing. Holding on to that sweet spot just before contraction gives you an idea of what is happening.

As I begin to ""flex"" this ""muscle"" inside my back, the feeling spreads through my legs, up my back, up my neck into my head and my arms until it is felt by every cell in my body.

The feeling can almost be described as the approach before sexual climax, with two exceptions; 1) It is not at all a sexually arousing feeling, more like a relaxing feeling; and 2), the feeling is experienced in the entire body, whereas orgasm is more localized in the genital area.

As I induce this sensation, my breathing involuntarily slows to a near stop. Sometimes my eyes close, and if I attempt to push this sensation to its limits (ie try to hold it as long as possible), my body inevitably experiences a shiver and I need to stop.

Here is a post from about 4 years ago with different accounts of this phenomenon: [AskReddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8nbje/have_you_ever_experienced_anything_which_you/c09txfd).

I contacted some of the people in the post a year later because my neurologist took an interest to this phenomenon and wanted to get some more information. Here is one alternate description of the sensation by /u/Rubenb:

&gt;Yeah, I remember that! How I start it is difficult to explain, it is a bit like tensing a muscle in my lower back and the back of my neck and the lower back of my skull, and when I do that it sends an energetic feeling through my back and legs, radiating outwards from my lower back region. It usually only works while seated or laying down, and I also need to hold my breath to make it happen. If I focus on it I can feel it faintly in other bodyparts as well, but that might just be my imagination. I have to make considerable effort to make it last more than a few seconds, and when I do that some muscles twitch slightly and unvoluntarily. The effect gets gradually fainter if I do it a few times in a row, and I start feeling a bit tired in my legs and head as well. I have also noticed that I can reproduce that endorphin rush you can get after sporting at will (although not as intense), which might be related. Basically it feels like I have some conscious control over the release of certain chemicals in my brain.
&gt;
&gt;I hope you can find out something interesting about it, keep me posted ;)

and another from /u/TwoToke:

&gt;Wow, I hadn't thought about it in a while. I'd figure a neurologist would at least have some inclination as to what it's called.
&gt;
&gt;I still have no clue how to describe how I'm able to do it. I would say that it's the opposite of contracting all the muscles in your body, basically trying to expand them. No one I talked to was able to describe how they achieved it. It would be like describing to someone how you're able to move your fingers. You can just do it, there's no process.
&gt;
&gt;The best explanation I could come up with was some sort of self- induced vasodilation:
&gt;
&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation
&gt;
&gt;I would suggest pasting all of the conversations we had in that thread into one document and let the neurologist see if they can pick out the clues they need. The ""Cold Electricity"" description for the feeling was the best I had heard, because it is a lot like having an electrical current going through you without the associated heat or pain.
&gt;
&gt;Definitely let me know if they figure it out. You've peeked my curiosity again...


I sincerely hope /r/Answers can help me finally understand what exactly it is we are doing, or any input/theories on what it could be. It is something that has been on my mind for years and I hope to put it to rest.

Each moderator tries their best to prevent /r/answers turning into AskReddit. Almost two years on, I would like to think that the moderators and the user-base have done a pretty good job at maintaining a high level of submissions. 


Now to the main issue: RyJones banning people and deleting comments.



RyJones is one of our most active moderators who continually tries to maintain the integrity of /r/answers. There is no doubt in my mind that every action RyJones does in this subreddit is to help our members have a better experience. He is incredibly proactive in filtering out comments/users that make poor submissions. In his defence, he takes a one-strike approach because he cannot constantly monitor every submission a user makes, and an offender normally repeats their offence.  I concede that he does take a strict stance with trolls and “non-answers”, do I condone it? Well no, but I also do not disapprove it. I'm certain that members of /r/answers do not want to scroll down to the bottom of a page just to find the correct answer of a question. Conversely, I am sure members do not want to be banned for having a discussion (non-answers) which may lead to a correct answer. 



So what is the answer to this issue? As it stands, RyJones does not seem to be online, so we do not have his input. However, all the other moderators agree that an outright banning (in [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/kwg5k/ive_been_banned_from_reddit_answers_apparently/) circumstances) is not a fair approach. /r/answers will advise RyJones to be more lenient in his approach when banning people and filtering submissions.

* I don't know anyone in prison (or at least, I don't *think* I do)
* The calls come at the same time (10:05-10:10am) every day
* It's a robo-call that says someone is TRYING to collect call me but that I have to sign up for a prepaid account first.

* They're very persistent
* I've googled the heck out of the company and they SEEM to be a real thing
* I suppose it's possible that someone I know is in jail and I don't know about it

There are a lot of reasons not to have done that. 

*First, the eagles aren't really under Gandalf's control and it isn't for sure that they would have agreed. 

*The eagle couldn't have carried Frodo all that way.

*If you just gave the eagle the ring then you have a giant eagle with the power of the ring. A giant, intelligent, evil, eagle overlord is probably worse than Sauron. 

*Remember the Nazgul? They upgraded to birds during the story. 

*There was a giant flaming eyeball searching the skies. I think maybe it might have noticed an eagle with a Hobbit on it's back.

A possible objection: if the eagle couldn't fly with Frodo then how did he get airlifted out of there? Answer: because after the ring was destroyed the Nazgul and Sauron were dead and the skies were once again safe for giant eagles. 

Objection: how did the eagle fly him all the way back to Rivendell? Answer: he didn't. I'd have to read it again, but I think they took him to Gondor first and then by horse to Rivendell.

Of course it can be argued that the purpose of art isn't to be photorealistic, but I have a hard time believing ""bad perspective"" is an artistic choice.

At that point, as I think I understand it, a newcomer sees the scratch I'm making, opens up her own stand and sells frozen bananas for $1.25, and all of my customers go to her instead.  In response, I have to offer my product at $1.00, and so on.  Eventually, this should result in both of our prices being forced infinitely close to $.60 (plus minimum wage, if we weren't working ourselves).

They either have XX or AA and the lines are at different intervals for the AA vs the XX (though all AA and XX are the same).

For those that asked if I sharpened it, would I see lead...the answer is no.  I even sharpened it on both ends just in case.  Here is another pic to prove it.  I also included a pencil and a sharpie so you could get a size comparison.

Cats4gold started it and bananasinpyamas brought it home below.  They are used in classroom lab experiments to be an example of tree ring dating.  Here is an [example bananasinpyamas found](http://www.connecticutvalleybiological.com/dendrochronology-tree-ring-dating-kit-labaids-p-13550.html), and here is an [example that biznatch11 found](http://www.lab-aids.com/catalog.php?item=52).  Please go down and give them some karma love.

By the way, I sharpened a piece of wood worth $1.67.

[A Warm Place](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN6sfJ1qFQg) by Nine Inch Nails.

Fourth post down was a *really* good answer to the question.

&gt;Well, I feel useful today. Karmawhores.net might be tracking 2,801 users, but I have 280,445 users in my own private db. They have a total of 135,921,988 comment karma, and 39,494,265 link karma. Only about five times as much karma as the karmawhores.net users! Just shows how much karma is going to the top users.
A few things to keep in mind about my data, the karma totals haven't been updated since the users were added, which is no longer than 7 months ago (when I started, on a side note, wow seven months I've been too lazy to finish what I'm using all this data for...I should probably get to that...), so some users probably have quite a bit more karma by now. Users are added if they commented on a front page story. /r/blog has 463,808 subscribers, so I have over half the users, and they should be by far the most active half (at commenting especially).
&gt;All in all I would say the real number is somewhere around twice that, for a ballpark, maybe more for the link karma, less for the comment karma.

If I pig out on greasy pizza and french fries, it is typically within an hour that I am running for the toilet, and from there it's explosive.

My thought is that since there is little nutritional value in these foods, my body is essentially saying *""fuck that shit"",* and passes it through as fast as possible.

I've recently taken up playing the Xylophone. It's going OK, but I've been struggling to find sheet music (or equivalent guitar tabs or what have you) for a few songs. Today's frustration is The Gonk from Dawn/Shaun of the Dead. 

My google-fu is usually pretty good but it's failed me. Are there any services where you can submit a music file and get sheet music out? Be it automagically done or by one of those genius types who can identify notes by ear.

I've managed to work out the first bit of this one by playing a clip shortened with Goldwave into a guitar tuner to identify the note, but this is a massive pain and also some of the notes aren't being picked up.

Debit: Money comes out right away. cash-back option if I need it. I use my pin as a 'signature'.

Credit: I sign the terminal/receipt. Money comes out of my account in 3-5 business days.

I remember reading an article somewhere that one was safer than the other in terms of security, since some card machines store some information until they're processed, so I've stuck with credit transactions. But now I can't remember what that article said, and I'm noticing that using a pin and seeing the money taken out of the account right away online is a lot more convenient for money management.

If it'd be the rolling-bit I could blame my computer for jittering, but a purely static line (i.e. the title of the movie front and center on screen) has no reason to do so.

It's not like it's still actually a physical 'roll' played in front of the camera, right? Especially as this is a fairly new movie (I've seen it done in others as well - explicit example doesn't come to mind though). Is this due to encoding, or done on purpose? I get the feeling it's the latter as for example the WB logo all the way at the end *is* entirely static.

But the obvious question is then; why do this? Easier to read? Isn't it too subtle for that? And how would this help? Or tradition maybe? Sounds like too obscure a detail to turn into tradition in the first place. So you know the movie's still playing? I think you'd start wondering that after ~5 seconds regardless. So.. yeah.

Plumber came and snaked it, but didn't pull clog out (presumably pushed in). 3 days later, toilet clogged again. Called plumber, he said that the clogging was caused by scratched porcelain and they were not responsible; the toilet should be replaced.
  
1. Is it credible that the slightly scratched porcelain is responsible, or is it more likely that the previous clog was simply not completely cleared? (Just for clarity, it is almost certain that I scraped the porcelain in my vain attempt to snake out the original clog.)   

2. Does scraped porcelain mean that I should replace the toilet?  
   
**UPDATE**: Bought a toilet auger yesterday ($10 at Home Depot)...I only had a crappy one with no handle and no sleeve, which is how I scraped the porcelain in the first place. Today, went for a few more plunges before using the auger.  The clog appears to be gone now!  Thanks to everyone for their help and advice. Well, almost everyone.   
  
**UPDATE2**: Went through several cycles of plunge/auger, all good, clogged again.  Finally said ""screw it"" and called a plumber, figuring it might need a longer auger.  He ended up pulling the toilet and found a small, hard plastic ant trap that someone managed to flush, which then got caught in the toilet in a place that resisted augering but aided clogging.

Around 2008 it was 1:7.5 or so. So it would seem the natural pressure is towards parity.

Wikipedia: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi_currency_value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi_currency_value)

&gt;Some have argued with the current economic conditions, the value of the Renminbi should appreciate from 20 to 40 percent against the US dollar.[3][4] According to the IMF, the yuan is undervalued somewhere between five to 27 percent.[5]

This suggests a freely floating RMB would move to, say, $1 US = 4 RMB

On the other hand, black markets in China often exchange at a rate the other way round e.g. $ US = 7 RMB, and a huge amount of Chinese money has been buying $US to purchase overseas assets like mining rights, property etc.

It seems to me as if the US thinks very highly of the RMB, and the Chinese think very highly of the $US.

So which way do you think it would go if the rate was allowed to free float instead of just trade in a tight band? What other factors would be at play?

The balls feel like glazed ceramic.  The are about the weight of marbles.  Each has 3-4 craters in no apparent pattern.  The craters are not-quite flat surfaces which break the glaze finish.

My dad does not know what they are.  Neither of my grandparents (who grew up in the area) know what they are.

It's a quick read, has decent advice, even if it's a bit obvious.

Anyway, one important scene is where the CEO decides one of the VPs isn't working out, and asks her to resign. Said VP gets all flustered and demands her stock options vest and some other bonuses, or the CEO will have to fire her. CEO signs and gives up millions of dollars to get this person to resign.

My question is: why bother? I can see asking someone to resign so you don't have to give them unemployment, but A) those kind of people probably don't apply for unemployment anyway and B) 'asked to resign' is effectively the same as firing so I imagine they would get unemployment anyway. In the above case it made even less sense to me: you're paying someone to resign instead of firing them for free - why give them money to get rid of them?

I could see if it was to maintain a fiction that they left on good terms, but it always comes out that they were asked to resign and everyone knows what it means, so that doesn't seem like it.

In Georgia, cannabis is regulated under the Georgia Controlled Substance Act. This law establishes the penalties for various levels of possession, use, etc. So it seems fairly clear that state law enforcement is obligated to enforce that law.

My question is whether or not city or county governments in Georgia are also legally obligated to enforce that law. (Possible contributory information: the state constitution also guarantees the right of home rule to counties)

A cop pulls in front of us (didn't see if it was local/sheriff/or state) and turned on his sirens. He started weaving back and forth across all 5 lanes. Gradually he was slowing down as well.

Eventually, he stops traffic on US 101 going south completely for like 5 seconds.
