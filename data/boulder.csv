This is Nate here from the CU Boulder Distinguished Speakers Board. A while back I posted here for suggestions on who to have speak at CU this year, and on the internet and in real life the response was overwhelmingly for Neil DeGrasse Tyson. So we're thrilled to announce that he is the first speaker we are bringing to campus, on February 15th 2012.

Dr. Tyson will be speaking on the collective expectations of humanity's progress in space exploration and the geopolitical, cultural, and economic obstacles that must be overcome to achieve them. The talk will be followed by a half hour question and answer session with members of the audience. 

Doors are scheduled to open at 6:45pm, and the speech will begin at 7:30pm. Tickets are $2 for CU students with valid student ID and $15 dollars for community members. Student tickets can be purchased from the Distinguished Speakers Board table on the first floor of the University Memorial Center, Monday through Friday between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Community tickets are available at http://macky.colorado.edu.

But seriously, after lurking for two years, I am tired of this subreddit acting so pretentious towards students in this town. It's like the Ps4 vs. Xbox one debate in /R/ Gaming. Every. Single. Post. mentions how the students are destroying this town. Seriously wake up because Boulder would struggle without the economic support of CU Boulder. The college alone hires more employees than any other business in town and the small businesses would be dead in the water without student support. Sure everyone wants a perfect little town but wake up and smell the coffee, Boulder needs CU to survive. Sure students who come here like to party but do you blame them?! 20 something year olds in the most beautiful town in the country trying to get laid, yes they are going to party. But the negativity towards them is unnecessary, if you dont want to deal with them then dont live on The Hill. I am in my late 50's and still enjoy seeing the students have a good time because I know what it is like to be that age. Whenever someone mentions they are coming to boulder the most popular post is always ""But the students drag it down"" Well this is a rant but I hope people can start to understand why they make our town special.

Go Buffs 

One last word: I expect some backlash but just had to get it out there, also I expect some posts ""But look at the beer cans on the front lawn"" Or they are ""so rich"" posts. However I tend to look at the better things in life and without them this town would be full of people like me, 50 year old hippies and exercise enthusiasts ",,False,self,t5_2qyl3,1371708119.0,,,True,t3_1gphzu,http://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/1gphzu/im_tired_of_this/,

Dear CU student:

The University of Colorado Boulder Chancellor Philip P. DiStefano announced
today that the University will be open to students, faculty and staff on April

the 4/20 gathering.

On Friday, April 20, CU-Boulder's classes will continue as scheduled, but the
following measures will be in place:

-- Students, faculty, staff and all CU-Boulder affiliates will need their
BuffOne ID cards to get on, and around, the campus. Those not affiliated with
CU-Boulder will not be permitted on campus and if found on campus will be
subject to a ticket for trespassing.

-- Police will have checkpoints set up on all major campus entrances. Those with
a valid CU parking permit may park on campus.

-- Norlin Quad lawn areas will be closed to all people. Anyone, regardless of
campus affiliation, who enters these areas will face a ticket for trespassing.
Closure signage will be clearly displayed in this area.

-- Visitors will not be allowed to park on campus. Attendants will check those
traveling to campus for BuffOne IDs and parking permits.

-- CU-Boulder police and regional agencies, and The Colorado State Patrol will
conduct enhanced patrols on U.S. 36, Colo. 93, the Diagonal Highway and other
highways throughout the day, looking for drivers under the influence of drugs
and/or alcohol.

-- Regent Drive will be closed to through traffic from approximately 1:30 p.m.
to 6 p.m. Only buses will be allowed to use Regent Drive. other drivers should
plan alternate routes.

-- The Buff Bus and RTD Stampede, 209, and J routes will be impacted between the
hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Please see
http://www.colorado.edu/pts/news/index.html for details on how these routes
will be altered and/or delayed.

-- CU-Boulder students are invited to attend the Wyclef Jean concert at the
Coors Events Center. Students attending the concert must be inside by 4 p.m.
Doors will be shut at that time. Attendees are free to leave whenever they
would like, however, there are no return privileges. For more information,

We recently brought Neil deGrasse Tyson to campus, and have valued the Reddit community's input in our speaker selection process. You can check out the photos over on our facebook page at facebook.com/cudsb. I think you can see the redditor row...

We are proud to announce that neuroscientist and New York Times Best Selling author Sam Harris is coming to campus on Monday, March 5th. 

Dr. Harris will be speaking on the illusion of free will and the moral and scientific implications of recent discoveries that many of the mechanisms that govern human behavior are random. The talk will be followed by a half hour question and answer session with members of the audience. Tickets are $2 for CU students with valid student ID and $10 dollars for community members. Student tickets can be purchased from the Distinguished Speakers Board table on the first floor of the University Memorial Center, Monday through Friday between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Community tickets can be purchased at macky.colorado.edu. Please contact cudsb@colorado.edu for hearing impaired tickets. 

If you represent a student group on campus, and are interested in buying tickets at a group rate, please contact us at CUdsb@colorado.edu. Thank you for your continued interest and commitment to CU DSB events, we hope to see you on March 5th.

1333472876.0,36,self.boulder,rreu3,4/20 E-mail sent by CU to students,turtlepharm,51,15,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/rreu3/420_email_sent_by_cu_to_students/,"Dear CU student:

As you know, your student government and the university administration would
like the disruptive, unnecessary and unsanctioned 4/20 gathering on the
CU-Boulder campus to end. With this in mind, please join us in taking key steps
this year to end 4/20.

We invite students who do not have Friday afternoon classes to attend the free
Wyclef Jean concert at the Coors Events Center, sponsored by CU Student
Government (CUSG) in partnership with Program Council.

The concert is for CU-Boulder students only. Doors open at 2 p.m. and will
close at 4 p.m. The concert is expected to end at 6 p.m. More information on
the concert will be e-mailed to students in coming weeks, so watch your e-mail
for upcoming announcements.

We also want to communicate some key changes and conditions that may impact you
or your peers on 4/20:

-- Tickets will be issued for smoking marijuana on the Norlin Quad, or anywhere
on campus, prior to, during and after the gathering. Such tickets can result in
a $100 fine.

-- Possession of a medical marijuana card does not entitle its holder to smoke
marijuana on campus, and in fact can result in revocation of the card.

-- Alcohol policies will be strictly enforced throughout the campus.

-- Students who receive tickets will be subject to a review process with the
Office of Student Conduct and if a student is found responsible, sanctions will
be issued.  Additional sanctions will be levied by the Boulder County and
Boulder City courts.

-- The federal Clery Act requires that the university maintain a publicly
accessible crime log. Those ticketed or arrested for violating CU rules and
state or local laws will have their names posted on the CU-Boulder police
website's daily crime log, which could affect their employment futures.

-- All classes and academic activities will go on as scheduled.

-- Please do not invite friends or visitors to campus that day. Those not
affiliated with CU-Boulder are advised to avoid the campus entirely on 4/20.

-- Plan ahead since extremely heavy traffic and long traffic jams are expected
on Broadway due to construction and along 28th Street due to overflow traffic.
University and City of Boulder guest parking will be virtually non-existent on
the CU-Boulder campus and in adjacent CU neighborhoods.

Please join the CU Student Government and the University in taking key steps
this year to end this disruptive, unsanctioned gathering on the CU-Boulder
campus. Your degree has value and your safety and your future matter to all of
us who are proud of the University of Colorado Boulder.

Sincerely,

Deb Coffin, vice chancellor for student affairs
Karen Raforth, interim dean of students

Anyone 21 or older is free to attend. We will drink and discuss beer, and just enjoy meeting local redditors. 

**Date:** January 11th

**Time:** 7pm

**Place:** Southern Sun (Directions can be found [here] (http://www.mountainsunpub.com/) )

**Southern Sun is a cash only joint.** Thanks for the reminder, imamc!

**We will be meeting at 7. Southern Sun doesn't seat until the whole party is there, so try to be prompt. We can't get a table unless we have everyone there. So we will ask for seating at 7, so try to be on time!**

If possible, post if you plan on joining. That way I can call in advance to try and secure enough room for everyone. 

This location and time is just for the first meetup. If we find a day/time/place that works better for everyone, we will do that for next time.

I've been removing posts from /u/earlobeanalprobe that add no meaningful discussion to any conversation, and are only Ad Hominem attacks. I accept that he and most of this subreddit have wildly different opinions, but if a post is purely Ad Hominem (from anyone), it's going to be removed.

I'm getting tired of a very vocal minority claiming the mods ""[seem to think it's funny and acceptable](http://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/1ink9y/help_catlovers_needed_to_take_care_of_my_cats/cb6emrn)"" that we allow these type of posts. I'd like to take a second to complain, but being a subreddit mod is a fucking awful job. It's purely volunteer-based and no matter what you're constantly being bitched at. Some of you may claim that this is the terrible responsibility of being a mod, but I'd retort that people can try to act like human beings and instead of doing the ever-so-popular reddit tactic of demonizing mods, try to **talk to us**. Hell, I've even been to a few of the [Beer Meetups](http://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/1hfg60/beer_clublast_month_before_college_kids_return/) in an attempt to be visible and accessible.

So here's the guidelines, subject to change and debate:

1. Ad Hominem attacks will be removed and will result in a warning.
1. Continued Ad Hominem attacks (post-warning) will result in a 3-day ban.

In the last few months, name-calling and generally useless, negative, and Ad Hominem comments have increased by an absolutely scientific measure of a fuck ton. /u/weatherstation and I have been content to let people downvote these comments to below threshold, but frankly I'm getting sick of seeing them. They serve no useful purpose, create division in a small subreddit, and they fail to add to any dialogue. 

I'd like to take this time to have a meaningful discussion on the direction of this subreddit, and an expansion of the post rules, since currently the only one we have is:

&gt;No Craigslist-style postings. Let's keep this more local happenings and communities. If you need to buy or sell something use a different venue.

Also, we could use a mod that feels like going through posts and doing the moderation queue before 10-11pm at night, daily (which is when I usually do it).

The Humane Society is absolutely overflowing with cats right now (over 100!), so the adoption fees on most kittens have been reduced from the usual $149/$199 to $79. The adult cats are also very cheap right now, many of them around $10. I've also heard a rumor that cat adoption fees might be waived from the 25th-27th, but don't quote me on that. 

All cats and kittens come spayed/neutered, dewormed, vaccinated for distemper and URI, and you get a $1 bag of food, a collar, a free vet exam, and 30 days of pet insurance that covers shelter related ailments. 

If you've been thinking about getting a cat, now is the time to do it.

I flew in on a Sunday (my interview was on Monday) and I went to Boulder once I had left my stuff at the hotel (which was in Westminster, by the company I was interviewing for). I liked it so much I went back the next day after my interview, in the hours before my flight home.

In case anyone's curious, I tried Foolish Craig's (which was excellent) and Mountain Sun (twice!) for food, and to Laughing Goat and The Cup for coffee, both of which were great too. Thanks to everyone who recommended these, and as for all the other recommendations, I hope to check them out once I move out there (got the job!).

How CU Tried to Steal 420

""Pooh-Pooh to the Stoners!"" Chancellor DiStefano was grinch-ish-ly humming. ""They're finding out now that no 4/20 is coming!""

""They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!""

""Their mouths will hang open a minute or two. Then the Stoners down in Boulder will all cry Boo-Hoo!""

""That's a noise,"" grinned DiStefano, ""That I simply MUST hear!"" So he
paused. And DiStefano put his hand to his ear. And he did hear a sound
rising over the snow. It started in low. Then it started to grow...

But the sound wasn't sad! Why, this sound sounded merry! It couldn't be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!

He stared down at Boulder! DiStefano popped his eyes! Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!

Every Stoner down in Boulder, the tall and the small, Was singing and smoking! Without any permits at all!

He HADN'T stopped 4/20 from coming! IT CAME! Somehow or other, it came just the same!

And DiStefano, with his feet ice-cold in the fish fertilizer, stood
puzzling and puzzling: ""How could it be so?"" ""It came with out permits!
It came without speeches!"" ""It came without Frisbees, or costumes or
bleachers!"" And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore. Then
DiStefano thought of something he hadn't before!

""Maybe 4/20,"" he thought,""doesn't come from a permit."" ""Maybe 4/20...perhaps...means a little bit more!""

And what happened then...? Well...in Boulder they say, DiStefano fired up a fatty and had a very nice day!

YOU CAN'T STOP 4/20 from Coming!

HAPPY 4/20!

Because we got a party package, we can purchase additional activities (like go-karts) at a discount.

When we are not off playing games, we will try to keep the group centered around the picnic tables at the front. You don't have to buy a wristband if you don't want to; you can just come and hang out with us at the tables.

Last Friday afternoon I, along with the rest of the CU-Boulder students, faculty, and staff received your memo about the upcoming campus access restrictions on April 20th.  The memo warned that only those with a valid CU Buff card would be allowed onto campus, with security check points at major entrances to enforce this rule. I find this policy to be an egregious violation of the rights of those affiliated with CU-Boulder, the Boulder community at large, and the core mission of the university.

The annual “4/20” event on campus might be a source of embarrassment to the administration of the university, *but this year’s heavy-handed policy is far more disruptive to both the operation and the reputation of CU-Boulder than the gathering on Norlin Quad ever was.*

As a graduate researcher part of my job to further the University’s goals of research excellence is regular collaborations with other scientists at other institutions and in industry. Symposia and other talks regularly occur on Fridays with many off-campus affiliates. CU-Boulder also hosts user research facilities whose mission is to provide access to equipment to researchers both in and outside of CU-Boulder, as well as industry.
The administration has implemented a registration system to allow access to campus for people that have business with the university, but this “papers please” complication has a chilling effect on collaboration. Do we want the reputation of this university to be xenophobic with police checkpoints to get access? Isn’t part of the mission supposed to encourage engagement with the wider academic, and general community?

I am very disappointed that my institution has decided to go this route to stop a protest that is otherwise only a minor inconvenience. On April 20th I encourage CU-Boulder student, facility, and staff to engage in civil disobedience by refusing to show ID to get onto campus. If the administration chooses to disrupt research by forbidding access to campus the loss in prestige will be on their heads. I cannot let this policy be implemented unchallenged. I hope that we can reclaim CU-Boulder from the misguided efforts of the current administration.


Sincerely,

A concerned member of the CU-Boulder research community.",,False,self,t5_2qyl3,False,,,True,t3_scp3u,http://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/scp3u/an_open_letter_to_university_of_colorado_boulder/,

I spoke with the folks at 303 today and since they don't serve food there (and their normal food truck won't be there) they are totally fine with us bringing our own food or ordering delivery.  Based on the recent post about delivery options, I was thinking The Sun Deli might be good.  Also, maybe then TheLastPinkUnicorn will show up with some hookers and weed for BillBrasky_.  So, if you think you might get the munchies, bring your own food or be prepared for an (easy) group order.

Happy Holidays, r/Boulderites!

I think it would be fun to get together at the Boulder Distillery to share the holiday cheer.  Let's do this.
****


**Where:  [303 Vodka / Boulder Distillery](http://303vodka.com/boulderdistillery/)** 2500 47th Street, #10

**When:  Saturday, December 10th at 5 pm.**

**But wait, there's more!...**

We will do the dreaded **[""white elephant"" gift exchange.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange)**  *(Try to contain your excitement...)*  Around 6 - 6:30 we will pick numbers to determine the order of gift choosers.  A gift can be nabbed up to 3 times.  It can be something from around your house or something you get special for this occasion.  Reddit memes are encouraged but any white elephant will do.  There is no minimum or maximum money limit for the gifts.  You definitely don't have to participate in the exchange if you want to come to the meetup, but it will be a lot of fun so it is encouraged.

We are looking into having some food delivered while we are there.  Does anyone have any good food delivery suggestions?  Is there food close by or otherwise available?  I'll update this post during the week with some specifics about getting some grub while we sample some of the delicious 303 spirits.

Some friends and I will be sharing a cab home.  It is about a 20 minute walk from 28th and Pearl and about 7 minutes by bike.  Feel free to post here if you want to discuss carpooling options with other redditors.

***Super Internet Nerds option:*** Wear your tackiest holiday outfit / gear / sweater!   There will be a prize given for the tackiest holiday attire.

And *last but not least* we will have a sign near us for your locating pleasure.


Hope to see you there!

Or does anybody need/want a running partner? I normally run various lengths of the Boulder Creek Path starting near Scott Carpenter Park and the CU Research Park, but I am open to whatever. 

Not in awesome shape, but trying to get better. I really want to start getting involved in the Boulder running community, so any suggestions would be incredibly helpful!

Chances are pretty good you won't be around to see it when, and if, it ever returns.

Today's especially good for viewing because it is clear as a bell out there. The spot to look is azimuth 317° (the northwest) and a bit over 3° above the horizon. From just east of Boulder (in the ""L"" corridor) the mountains rise about 1.5°, so double that height again to find the comet.

Tips for seeing it:

* Get out of Boulder! Boulder is down in a valley with the northwest horizon blocked by glorious mountains. Head east, probably no further than highway 287, to get a better look.
* Avoid light pollution! Seek out a spot that's not a supermarket parking lot. I recommend either of Valmont Road out by 95th, Lookout Road, or Highway 52.
* Bring magnification! A pair of binoculars will do. Better yet a camera with a zoom/telephoto lens. Best yet a proper telescope.

I feel like normally people would make social contacts through work but unfortunately the place I work at consists of just me and two 50-60 year old programmers so that hasn't panned out too well.

Thanks Reddit!

EDIT:

Due to popular request this has spawned a meetup. There's another [meetup thread] (http://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/ud2zh/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_boulder_redditor/) that started about the same time mine did. They seem to be interested in something on pearl street later on. Most of the replies here have been in response to my suggestion of Boulder Beer mid to late afternoon. I see no reason why we can't please both crowds.

I'll be going to Boulder Beer at 4pm, probably sitting outside if the weather's nice with some kind of sign. I'm going to get food there and the offer of a buying the first round still stands.

After this anybody who is interested can migrate to pearl street where we'll join the other meetup for late night activities. Still unsure of the exact details for this but I'll post them up as soon as they are confirmed.

Given the response was relatively strong for such an obscure post, I decided to follow through (now that I'm back from a vacation, anyway). Ideas as to other reddits to refer to this post would be appreciated.

I've long been curious what a random sampling of local redditors would be like--and I've been working at home exclusively since moving to Boulder, so haven't had a chance to make many local contacts via my job.

Oskar Blues [was suggested](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cw7tz/i_am_utterly_terrified_to_drive_down_this_street/c0vrrn0), but I'd rather the first Boulder meet-up be a bit closer to, well, Boulder. If the local crowd wants to hike up to Longmont, I'll follow along, at least the first time, though I think we'd have a better turn-out for a Boulder meet-up if we met in Boulder. I'm on the south end of Boulder myself, so it's close to 40 minutes to get anywhere in Longmont from here. If anyone has any Boulder venue suggestions, feel free to post them in the comments. 

My thoughts are that a good venue would allow for a flexible sized gathering, and wouldn't be so loud as to hamper conversation. 

I'm free on Monday or Tuesday evenings (except for the first Monday of any month). For this first meet-up I could meet on an August Wednesday, if that's the only choice that works for a lot of others. I'll post a few comments with various dates I'm available; upvote the ones you can make. If someone can't make any of the options I post, feel free to post your own date(s), but you're on your own for organizing it. 

And if it goes well, we can rotate different days of the week in future meet-ups, to try to accommodate more redditors.

**[EDIT]** I stared an announcement-only Google group for [Boulder redittor meet-ups](http://groups.google.com/group/boulder-redditors). No spam; just an announcement of any Boulder-area redditor meet-ups. Likely no more than 1-2 messages a month, if you're worried about it. I won't even post to it until we've settled on a date here.

Thoughts? Ideas? Suggestions?

**[EDIT 2]** Looking like this Monday or Tuesday are tied. I think this time around I'm going to say ̶T̶̶u̶e̶s̶d̶a̶y̶,̶ ̶A̶u̶g̶u̶s̶t̶ ̶1̶0̶. We got two votes for Boulder Beer, but I can't find any indication that they have good *food* in addition to good beer; if anyone knows otherwise, I'm willing to give it a try, but the **Walnut Brewery** allegedly has good food *and* beer, and as such has my vote.

Get your final votes or comments in, and I'll put up an official announcement tomorrow at the latest. I figure the time will start at around 6pm, and I'll hang out until at least 9pm or so--people can arrive and/or leave as they need. I'll have a Reddit alien printed out on a page to identify our table/area.

**[EDIT 3]** Let's do **Monday, August 9,** to not stomp on the Boulder Hackerspace meeting on Tuesday, August 10. I shouldn't post when I'm half asleep.

**[EDIT 4]** To be clear: Hackerspace has its own meeting that's independent of this one (and which I may attend as well). The Reddit meet-up is **Monday**.

* First and foremost, if you have any breathing or respiratory problems, I highly recommend that you skip this year's ride to work day. Next year will hopefully be better, but with the fire and smoke I suggest driving in.
* Remember that you are basically a car out there. Just much smaller and more vulnerable. Pay attention to traffic signals, stop signs and always stay to the right. Always.
* Give yourself a little extra time tomorrow morning. This is not only because biking in is likely to take some more time, but also when you take your bike out tomorrow for likely the first time in months it's likely to have a few things that need work on it. Pump up the tires, adjust the seat, make sure that the chain can move under that heavy coat of rust. I would suggest taking it to a bike shop, but it is 9 pm the night before so you might have to just risk it.
* Have your path planned out. Stay off of the heavy traffic roads that you usually drive in and instead find something simple with a wide shoulder or even better find a bike path. In Boulder you can get basically anywhere on the bike path system. Don't believe me? [This is the path system](http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/files/GOBoulder/maps/Master_Bike_Map_20111201_reduced.pdf) you have to work with tomorrow. Use it well.
* No one will judge you for taking the bus half way. I'm not suggesting that you are all completely out of shape, just riding into work can be quite a ride for a lot of us, so busing into Boulder with a bike is a great idea. People will still give you food as long as you are on some sort of cycling device.
* Finally, be prepared and **wear a goddamned helmet.** Having a helmet on is just smart and on day like this, I'd say it's simply a good idea no matter what. Also as far as being prepared goes bring an extra bike tube, tire levers, and pump if you have it. These things will save your ass and if you find yourself in that situation where you have a flat and don't know how to fix it, find some passing cyclist and ask for help. If they are anything like me they'll be glad to help.

I could probably throw more in but it's getting late and redundant. If anyone is riding in from Lafayette tomorrow, I'll be leaving my house and will be going down Baseline around 6:45am then leaving Boulder to get to work in Lafayette around 8:15 if anyone was looking for someone to pull them in. I was thinking about heading back into Boulder after work to hit up Valmont or something if someone wanted to meet there around 5 for an end to the worlds greatest Holiday. If anyone wants to ride in with me I'll be the guy that looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/79O16.jpg) on [this bike](http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/bikes/mountain/singletrack_trail/fuel_ex/fuel_ex_8/)

In this town there is a couple that owns and operates a [classic pinball arcade](http://www.lyonspinball.com/), with a ton of awesome machines.  They're open Wed-Sun till 10 PM.  It's a really neat, eclectic, unique place to visit, and I would almost put it in the ""must see"" for people who live here, especially if you like quirky/unique places (one of the things that keeps me sane in Boulder are the strange places like this).  They keep all of the prices at their original cost, so all the really neat old machines are only a quarter, I made five dollars last an hour. Oh... and, for the more serious folk, they have a tournament night once a month as well.

You should go check it out, heck, I would even propose a reddit caravan to mitigate transportation costs.  I lived here four years without going, and now that I've been I wish I would have gone sooner.  Also, Lyons is a really neat town in general anyway.

After a couple hours in the park, we will probably head downtown for beers and merriment. (this post will be updated if we leave the park)


I will try to have a giant reddit alien on a stick to make the group easier to find.

**Note:** Parking is limited at the park, so keep that in mind. Also, feel free to coordinate carpools in the comments.",,False,self,t5_2qyl3,True,,,True,t3_i6nfj,http://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/i6nfj/reddit_meetup_june_25_at_5_pm_eben_g_fine_park/,

Whether you celebrate this time of year or not, I think it's good to be able to take a moment to notice the beauty that's around us.  The snow, crunchy or soft, the sunset (or rise, depending on which way you swing), the wind, the view ... all the things that no one can take away from you but can still seem so fleeting.

I had a conversation with a friend yesterday that made me to want to remind folks that if you're feeling sad or desperate, you should reach out ... or take a walk (or slide down a snowy hill) ... or do something that makes you genuinely happy, even if it's just for a moment.  This time of year can be difficult.  I've spent some holidays alone, sometimes on purpose - sometimes not.  It's not always easy.  But if you're here, alone - and you don't want to be - reach out.  *(If r/boulder is quiet, reach out to those freaks on r/denver (I keed! I keed!) ... or go to r/longmont if you want to meet some solid, chill folks ...)*  And if you're rockin' it alone and want to be - more power to you, because that stuff can be really good for you too.

There's got to be some great life quotes to throw out there right now ... anybody got one?

Okay ... and as your holiday gift on r/boulder (cue oprah moment) you can now create your own FLAIR!  I know, exactly what you were dreaming of.  Try it out here on this thread if you'd like with a good quote, well wishes, or whatever.  The area to your right should read ""Show my flair on this reddit.  It looks like:""  and then just try to follow directions.  If you can't figure it out, just spend some more time browsing reddit, it will all work out eventually.

I think it costs $8 or $10 for a day pass if it's your first time at Movement ($16 for a day pass otherwise.) It'll be a few more bucks to rent a harness, shoes, and belay device.

We have a reservation for r/Boulder at Gateway Fun Park on Saturday, July 30th at 7pm.  The reservation gets us the ""Gateway Fun Package"" which means that for $10.50 (per person), we will each get a wristband for:  1 round of mini-golf, 10 arcade tokens, 1 maze run, and 2 batting cage tokens (40 pitches).  Because we got a party package, we can purchase additional activities (like go-karts) at a discount.  Just go to the counter and tell them that you are there for the Reddit meetup.  When we are not off playing games, we will try to keep the group centered around the picnic tables at the *front* of the park.  You don't have to buy a wristband; you can just come and hang out with us at the tables.  (We will *not* be in the picnic shelter - there is another party going on in there.)

For the local beer lovers (!):  We will be meeting up **before** the Fun Park at 5 o'clock at the [Upslope Brewery.](http://upslopebrewing.wordpress.com/)

SO r/Boulder:  Upslope Brewing at 5 and the Gateway Fun Park at 7 on Saturday, July 30th.  See you there?

****

Maybe a place for us to have a meetup is the [Gateway Fun Park.](http://www.gatewayfunpark.com/)  It's in north Boulder.  It's relatively acceptable walking distance from the Skip, definite potential for carpooling, and -of course- bike-able.  

We've got over 650 people chillin here now... how many can we get in north Boulder?  How about Friday, JULY 29th or Saturday the 30th?  Do either of those dates work?  If it's a Friday - maybe 7 - 9ish?  If on Saturday - maybe 5 - 7ish?

They have food and games.  At bare minimum, we can make reservations for a pizza party and have seating, sand volleyball and horseshoes reserved for us.  We can reserve more (food) if there is enough interest... things like BBQ, pasta, and veggie friendly options. 

Want to meetup?

If we're going to be working together, I need to know more about you.  I figure now is as good a time as any to begin discussing and negotiating Boulder as a post-zombie apocalypse society.  So let's share zombie apocalypse plans so that we can stay out of each other's way, or perhaps even cooperate.

I will be taking residence on the roof of Neptune Mountaineering. This is becuase I live close to there, and I forsee having access to the hardware, sports equipment, used clothing, canned food, mountaineering stuff, and beer to be quite handy.  Once I have my rooftop society up-and-running, I will be open for trading and even possibly applicants, but be warned that I will maintain a strict zero-tollerance policy for douchebaggery.

I moved here just a little under 3 months ago from California.  I have never witnessed snowfall before, and it's awesome (but also very scary)!  I was wondering do you guys have any tips on how to deal with this weather?  I don't think I have proper clothes/shoes for this weather... are regular tennis shoes and a raincoat/sweatshirt enough or am I going to freeze to death tomorrow?  I don't really have to commute far to school, but I do usually bike.  Is it safe to bike on snow?  Also, my car is parked outside, is there anything I should do to ensure my car doesn't get messed up?  I don't really know what else to ask, so enlighten me on everything snow related.

Tell me your ways!

Thanks,

Actinide

EDIT:  Thank you so much for your help.  I do plan on getting some nice gloves/jacket/and boots for the winter as soon as I can.  

I won't try to bike until I get more practice (luckily I can just take the bus).

1328917481.0,15,self.boulder,pk332,Attention Single Men of Boulder: ,nefariousmango,26,11,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/pk332/attention_single_men_of_boulder/,"My three best friends have asked me to find them suitable suitors, and given the response I got yesterday in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/piwmv/dating_in_boulder/) I figured it was worth giving them a thread of their own!  If any of them sound like good matches, or you just want to throw yourself out there, write me a similar summary of yourself and what you're looking for in a partner.  I'll send them along to the appropriate ladies (none are redditors) and let them choose whether or not to contact you, so make sure you give them enough to go off of!

All three are active, attractive, and intelligent, and I've known two of them for over 20 years. They're also all a bit dorky/nerdy and as happy to crash on the couch and watch ""Buffy"" as they are to go hiking.  They're all 25-26 years old.

Lady #1 is a child psychologist (masters degree) who is finally ready to settle down. She just moved back to Boulder with her two cats, whom she has trained to sit and fetch. They're kind of like weird little dogs. She does a lot of yoga and loves hiking and swimming. Her apartment is not only clean, but comfortable and nicely decorated with real art and everything! She's a great cook, too! She's ready for a long-term, committed relationship if she finds the right guy. She's reliable, stable, and has a great sense of humor. Oh, and she can play the good Jewish girl for the parents of any good Jewish boys out there, especially if you play the part for her mom, too!

At 5'8"" she's hoping for a taller guy, but won't hold height against you if you're awesome in other ways.  Her perfect guy is confident, motivated, honest, and not afraid of real life (ie stays calm and keeps his sense of humor when things don't go as planned).  

Lady #2 is applying to physics education research PhD programs at the moment, so she'll probably be moving next fall. She's a bit of a hipster with her collection of refurbished old cameras and shelves of vinyl. Oh, and she plays the ukelele! She does a bit of cross-fit and is a member of a secret running club for math professors/ graduate students. Her cat also fetches, but is far more cat-like than Lady #1's cats. She's vegetarian but seriously doesn't care what other people eat. Her family is Jewish, but her mom is very new-age and she herself is skeptical of religion.  She sits with Lady #3 and me sometimes but wouldn't consider herself Buddhist.

She needs a stable, mature guy, with a career or career path of his own; she's done supporting poetry PhDs (no offense)!  She has joked that a metro-sexual vegetarian architect would probably be her ""type.""  Like lady #1, she wants someone who can gracefully handle the ups and downs of life, no drama!  Empathy is very important to her as well, as she isn't always good at knowing when she needs support (she focuses too much on other people's emotions and forgets about her own).  If you like to take charge and plan dates, she'll adore you for it!  

Lady #3 took a couple years off between high school and college to work for a renowned dressage (horseback riding) trainer, and will graduate this spring from CU with her degree in architecture. She is by far the most energetic of the three, and would spend her entire life riding, rock climbing, hiking, and exploring if she could! She's really fun, and funny, and surprisingly well grounded. She can be a bit disorganized, but keeps her space clean. She has a ball python and is rehabbing her old, once-fancy horse who hurt himself a few years back, and loves all animals. Of the three, she is the least proficient at cooking (but she's learning!) and the least ready to settle down, but also the most able to keep up with any crazy Boulder athletes out there! She's a practicing Buddhist too, although she doesn't care what you ""are"" as long as you don't put her down for practicing.  

She doesn't really know what she wants yet, aside from a supportive partner to go on adventures with!  I think she needs someone really nice, who would enjoy cooking and hanging out on the couch as well as going rock climbing.

Thanks for reading all that, I hope we can make some wonderful matches!!

1316490900.0,12,self.boulder,kl8ld,I made a new Boulder subreddit for all the fuzzy ones out there...,,21,9,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/kl8ld/i_made_a_new_boulder_subreddit_for_all_the_fuzzy/,"Here's how it started:  After one of the last meetups, I wanted to post my (admittedly crummy) picture of the group about a day after we met at Avery.  But, someone kept immediately downvoting the post so that it could not be seen on the r/Boulder front page.  It was frustrating.  I'd wait a while and resubmit, and this person who must have a lot of time on their hands was ready to downvote the submission.  Finally, I waited until the next day when some more rational people might be looking at the board and submitted it then in hopes that it would stick that time and it did.  I've seen numerous posts go invisible on the r/Boulder front page because of two or three downvotes.  I've approached other moderators and the administrators and it doesn't seem like there is much that can be done about it.  I put a note in the sidebar to remember to check out the ""new"" posts because they still show up there.

****

I don't have a problem with things being downvoted.  It's probably against reddiquette to downvote for the reasons these folks are using, but ultimately ... if those people are feeling such a different vibe about things, more power to them, let'em downvote until their heart is content.  But what I don't like is the affect that it has on everyone else's ability to readily see the posts. r/Boulder won't show posts on the front page that are at zero votes or below.  Lame!  Most of this stuff isn't even my cup of tea ... I just don't like to see this stuff get silenced to a degree and thought this might help.

****

So I thought about it and there are some certain types of posts that seem to always get downvoted, regardless of utility to some members of the group.  Mary Jane always goes down, some concerts and shows go down, social activities can be hard to get past those downvotes ... and my poor sweet little picture of the innocent people at Avery Brewing... three tries and one day later, the group finally got to see it while the troll was sleeping.

****

And I'd like to apologize now for the lower than normal quality of my writing; I'm super tired.

****

I created Boulder Uncut as a place for the socializing Boulderites to go and post about whatever heathen topics they want.  Don't like to talk about weed?  Don't go there.  Don't care if we all want to meet up for a beer?  Don't go there.  Does the thought of other people having fun upset you?  Join us!  We're mostly the same way!  And if you can't do that for whatever reason ... don't go to the page.

****

There we will be Wild Hairs of the Boulder persuasion.

****

This isn't intended to replace the meetups and other social discussions that happen on r/Boulder.  This will allow us to now include broader discussions that may involve things that the general population find to be undesirable, distasteful, and god forbid cliche.

****

I think r/Boulder and r/BoulderUncut will work nicely together.  Want to put up a personal ad?  Do it!  Your soul mate may be a subscriber.  Is your band playing somewhere?  Promote it!  Ents - want something?  What is it you want anyways.  Probably Cheetos at this time of night.  Tell us what you want Boulder Ents - this is here for you too.


****

I'll post a link around r/Boulder to remind people it exists.  It could go inactive after a bit or it could flourish.  I'm probably going to continue to dink around with the CSS on there just to see what all I can do.  Make it yours.  The world is our uncut oyster.  Okay ... I'm cheesing out, I better go to bed.  Twenty bucks says this post gets downvoted and no one gets to see it.  ;)

**UPDATE:** I talked to the gamer's guild in town (north boulder, close to amante coffee), they are capable of hosting a LAN party. Anyone interested in attending, send me a message! I'm going to start getting an attendance list together, then we'll work out timing. Ask your friends, let's try to get a big group together, the more the merrier! it'd also be good to get a list of games together, just so everybody has an idea of what we'll be doing.

I need some help with this; this is going to be my first time attending a LAN party, much less hosting one. If anyone with experience wants to help me organize this, it would be greatly appreciated. I will also need help setting up the game networks.

**I need to start a formal attendance list!! please send me a message if you want to come!! include what hardware you can bring (PC, ethernet switch, etc.), when you're available, and what hardware you need. once we have an idea of who's coming, we can figure out a date for this LAN party!!**



There will be some cost associated with reserving the space, internet connection, etc.. 

**edit:** I talked to the gamer's guild today, they have 4 PCs for people to use if they don't have their own. If you don't have your own hardware, you're still welcome to come!

**current game list:** Battlefield Bad Company 2, Starcraft 2, Team Fortress 2


**original post:** Alright, I know we're a big outdoor town, and I should be out kayaking/mountain biking/hiking/etc. (which i usually am!), but i want to know if there's anyone around that hosts LAN parties for those days that i'm feeling lazy.


I know there are a few people out in denver that host pretty frequently, but i don't plan on driving 45 minutes just to play video games.


anyway, if anyone here has some info, let me know!",,False,self,t5_2qyl3,True,,,True,t3_iu6v0,http://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/iu6v0/lan_parties/,

The Wiki uses [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax, similarly to Reddit. To create a subheadding (that'll be linked in the right sidebar), you'll create a H2 tag. The Markdown for this looks like:

with the information you want to post under the heading following it. If possible, post relevant ranking/rating/review sites along with a link to the website (see the [services](http://boulder.reddit.com/wiki/services/) page for an example.

I figured I'd try y'all before the randomness that is CL, living with a fellow redditor could be fun for the remainder of my lease, so here's the skinny:

- Roommate moved out recently to move into another house with an early lease date, so his room is empty in our 2 bedroom apartment, and we would love to move someone else in! The apartment is located in SE Boulder, http://www.flatironviewapartments.com/, complex also has a pool if you're into swimming
- tbqh I rather like the location, Bus? less than a minute walk to the table mesa park 'n' ride for easy downtown or Denver - Bicycle? not bad at all getting to central Boulder, this is how I personally prefer get around most the time - Drive? quick access to zoom via foothills/table mesa/baseline
- Rent per person is $500/month (June would be prorated if you choose to move before July) plus utilities, usually ends up being ~$600
- Unit was renovated right before we moved in last winter, so everything looks pretty nice.
- I'm a mid twenties male, and I love to cooking (spicy food is my favorite, I personally don't eat meat but don't mind if you do), exercising (&lt;3 road bike), and socializing. 
- I'm out of the house fairly often for either work (I just started my own company so I'm zipping around quite often) or pleasure so if you need your space that shouldn't be a problem at all!
- Only thing I really would have a problem with is parties being hosted at the apartment, I don't mind gatherings at all, I would just prefer if people are going to get sloshed that take place downtown or at someone else's place, :)

Too Long Didn't Read?

I am  not hugely picky, just as long as bad odors aren't invovled (indoor smoking, dirty dishes, poorly kept litterboxes etc) and you can keep the place relatively clean.  Being another nerd is a huge plus.

If you are interested shoot me a pm and we can meet somewhere to discuss finding a place.

Hey folks!

I had a request in the previous meet-up thread to organize another get together.

I am looking for ideas on when and where to host the event. Last time a full meet-up occurred we went to Beau Jo's, and that place seemed to work well.

**Location Ideas:** (looking for locations that ideally can take reservations for 20+ people)

* Beau Jo's
* Dark Horse
* Food Court on the Hill
* Qdoba on the Hill (they have an upstairs area that is usually empty)
* Other?

**Date/Time:** *thinking next week or the following week*

* Thursday 6 or 7 pm
* Friday 6 or 7 pm
* Sat/Sun afternoon to evening

What sounds good for people? Also, those over 21 might plan to go out afterwards, depending on how people feel.

**But first**: If you're not interested in deliberating, and just want to hear about the meet-up before it happens, **[sign up to this list for announcements](http://groups.google.com/group/boulder-redditors)**. Members can't post to the list, so you won't get a lot of noise. Only 1-2 messages per month are expected.

The last meeting was great. The people were awesome, and the conversation was fun, which is why I'm motivated to try it again. 

September, for various reasons, I am pretty well restricted to Tuesday nights. I'll post specific Tuesday dates; please vote on any date you can reasonably make, and we'll use the one with the most votes. I'm starting in mid-September so that we'll be able to give everyone at least a couple weeks notice.

As to location: Last time we were at a bar in downtown Boulder, and that worked out great, but our group was pretty small. If it had been much larger, we wouldn't have fit very well. And, based on what I'm hearing, there may be a lot more people this time around. 

So I'm thinking we might actually want a place that *isn't* quite so  popular, or at least some place that has a lot of room.

A good pizza place might be ideal. I like [Beau Jo's](http://www.beaujos.com/index.html) at Baseline &amp; Broadway, for example. Other suggestions are welcome; post your location suggestion(s) in the comments.

**EDIT: OK, September 14 at Beau Jo's it is!** I'll try to stake out a corner by 5pm, and will stick around until at least 8pm. There will be a reddit-alien sign to identify the table, so you won't have to approach random tables to figure out who we are, or you can ask at the door.

I'm from the South, where you kindof assume any place you go will have fried mac and cheese and/or fried pickles on the menu.  We're pretty into awesome food.  In a related storey, we're also pretty into cholesterol and heart attacks.  

Anyway, I have a friend here who has never tried fried mac and cheese, but wants to.  I've spent a while searching with Google, Yelp, etc, but have only found the Starlite Diner (which gets less than stellar reviews).

Does anyone know of another place with good fried mac and cheese, preferably open late?  It'd also be awesome if it was around Pearl (so I could cap the night with it, then stumble home and not have to worry about driving).  And it would also be cool if they have some vegetarian options (she's vegetarian and my favorite food is pulled pork--which makes hitting up barbecue restaurants a bit of a challenge).  But really, I'm open to anything--I can just manage my schedule so I'm a bit less stumbly, and we really don't need to order anything other than the mac and cheese, so the rest of the menu isn't THAT important.

Thanks (in advance) for helping me find some fried awesome!


**Edit:** Running tally of y'all's awesome recommendations:

* Backcountry Pizza (x2)
* South Mouth (x2)
* Pub on Pearl
* Harpo's
* Oak (x2, for fried pickles)
* Biker Jim's (Denver)

Apparently I'm just not good at the internet...Backcountry Pizza or Pub on Pearl are looking like good bets for tonight (so far), assuming I stick to the plan of walking from the Pearl area.

Why is the 4/20 smoke out on the CU campus? Is it tradition - ""it has always been there"" - and the participants don't want to change? It seems like the University is fighting this for a number of reasons that can each be debated on its respective merit but ""CU is against marijuana legalization"" does not seem to be one of them.

If it is a political event, what does it have to do with the university? Is the message of the political event directed at CU? At Colorado state government? The Federal Government? Some combination? Did CU ""do"" something to merit the protest being located on campus?

If it is a party, does it have to happen on the CU campus? What would the implications be of the event taking place somewhere else? Would that ""ruin"" it? What would the reaction be if (admittedly unlikely) Boulder county were to say ""fuck it, the boulder county fairground is yours for 2 hours, cops there to keep the peace but no marijuana enforcement, get a dispensary or someone to sponsor cleanup and some music."" Would people go?

I don't smoke but am pro legalization. I didn't grow up or go to university in this country so I am a bit bewildered. I guess my expectation is for politically active movements to make demands and make them to the entities that can meet those demands.

I'm an ex-Rocky Mountain Rollergirl and still stay somewhat active with the group.  Over the years I've helped to host several Party Buses to the bouts from both Longmont and Denver.  I was wondering if any of you might be interested in catching the Party Bus that departs from the Left Hand Brewery in Longmont to watch our home team -the Fight Club- play against San Diego on October 1st at the Fillmore in Denver.  If there is interest, I'll work it out to where I can host that bus and we can rule the roost!

Basically, what happens is you buy a ticket and meet at the brewery.  You'll get tickets for 4 beers to drink on the bus (drink all 4 on the way down, 2 on the way there/2 on the way back, give 3 tickets to me so I can have 7 beers... whatever you want to do).  We'll all ride together on a Greyhound style bus to the bout, watch the game, and then ride back to the brewery (it will be closed by the time we get back so no after-after party).  

Other details:  

* 
My best advice to anyone wanting to watch roller derby is to learn the rules.  It's not all of the show and drama anymore - people fancy it as a sport, and as such - knowing the rules is very important.  (Otherwise it just looks like a bunch of girls skating in a circle over and over.) [Here is a link to an old video about the basic information.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T8izdlc-dY) 


* 
Tickets to the October 1st bout aren't on sale yet and won't go up until after the bout next weekend.  [But, you can check out the RMRG website here.](http://www.rockymountainrollergirls.com/)

* 
The tickets are $27 and include the ticket to the bout, the ride down and back, and 4 Left Hand beers.

Any interest?

Longmont,dj_van_gilder,15,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/iosgv/woke_up_this_morning_to_find_a_complete_stranger/,"Shortly after waking up this morning, my roomie ask me to come downstairs.  He asks me who the guy passed out on the couch is.  I didn't know him so we both wake up our other roomie who's room is right next to the guy on the couch.  He has no idea who he is either.  It is at this point that I realize there is a complete stranger in my house asleep on my couch.  I debate whether or not I should go get my kitana before I wake this guy up, but I reason that he is probably drunk as hell and not likely to give me much grief once he realizes where he actually is.  So I yell at the guy to wake up, and he grumbles and rolls over and sits up.  I ask him who he is and what he is doing here.  He looks around very confused not answering my questions.  He then mumbles something about not ever going to poker night again.  He ask where is is as he struggles to put his shoes on.  I tell him Rose st.  He ask, ""Where is that?""  I tell him near 11th and Sunset. Then one of my roomies Andy picks up a brown hoodie on the other couch and ask him if it is his.  He said it was not.  This makes me wonder if there was more than one person that spent the night down there.  The guy is obviously very hung over and just sitting there so I say in a rather impatient tone that he needs to get up and get the fuck out of my house NOW. 
We all looked around and nothing appeared to be missing or even moved.  So just a reminder guys lock your doors at night, even if you live in a safe neighborhood.

It's difficult to reconstruct the fight from just the sounds, but I'll try with last night: I heard what sounded like a metal trash can turn over and spill. Then it sounded like one big animal was chasing away several smaller ones. The smaller ones made a high pitched *woop*ing noise -- almost like when a cop car toggles its siren on and off rapidly, *woopwoopwoop* -- and then I heard what sounded like growling, or almost barking. It makes me think there's a wolf or a mountain lion that chased some raccoons or something away from some trash. Whatever it is, it was big and it was pissed.

This Saturday I wanted to do an epic mountain bike ride that basically spans a good number of the trails in Boulder. Starting at the Marshall Mesa, going over to Doudy Draw, up to North Boulder to hit the Foothills trail, then riding up 36 to Heil Ranch, going down Picture Rock, doing a quick up and down through Hal Ranch, back down 36 to where we got off the Foothills so we an hit the Eagle trail, then a bit of road riding over to the White Rocks trail that will spit you out on Valmont Road. A quick spin through the Valmont bike park then off to Boulder Beer to finish off the day.

I mostly just wanted to check if anyone wanted to join me on this or had any suggestions to make it better. I had a brief thought to add Walker Ranch into it but that just seemed way too stupid for my liking. Batasso was another thought but sadly that trail is closed on Saturdays.

So any cyclists out there want to join me in this tour of some of Boulder and Lyons' trails? If so I'll be at the Marshall Mesa trail head near  around 8 am on Saturday.

* must be ticklish
* must be willing to be tickled and tickle others
* must be willing to be in bondage for some shoots (usually something visually interesting like getting duct taped to a wall)

Our background: I'm finishing a dual Master's in Ethnomusicology and Library Science. BF is an artist and considering grad school, thinking about becoming a teacher. We love the arts (of course), good food, gardening, and being outdoors. Biking is also very important for us. I have a car but prefer not to use it. We would like to find a city that is not overwhelmingly large, with a good music/art scene, and lots of opportunities for hiking/backpacking nearby. 

Primary questions: Everyone I talk to says Boulder is great but expensive. Is there affordable housing? Can we survive and find jobs as twenty-somethings with some work experience and liberal arts backgrounds? We're intelligent and resourceful, just interested in getting by, not getting rich or anything.

How is the public transit/biking in Boulder? Do you find it easy to get where you need to go? Also, how hard is it to get to Denver/Ft. Collins?

What are the different neighborhoods like? Are there any places you would especially avoid or definitely recommend checking out if we go to visit?

I'm moving out to Boulder in ~6 weeks.  I need to find a place before moving out there and was looking around craigslist and found Housing Helpers.  I was wondering if any native Boulder residents have any advice on them as a company.  The reviews on yelp were mixed.  I gave them a call and it seemed alright, but at the same time, I'm weary of scams.  Lastly, my biggest issue is that I cannot get out to Boulder prior to moving there since my work schedule is pretty unaccommodating. 

Thanks for any advice!

**EDIT 1:**  Thanks so much for all of the advice so far.  I'm looking into all of the property management places around Boulder and will ask more here!

Also, the instant replies makes me excited to move to Boulder and meet all of you soon in the reddit meetups!

**EDIT 2:** Any word on Fowler Property Management?  They have a few places that looked real nice (and some that Housing Helper found for me, coincidentally).

**EDIT 3:** I've definitely moved on past HH, thanks to most of the insightful comments here.  I'm really looking into Fowler Property Management and a few of the locations they had along Gold Run.

I find it hard to believe there aren't any. His definition of a dive bar:

1. Does not serve food or have a kitchen
2. Dark, smelly, few if any windows at all
3. Opens 11am or earlier, is fairly empty all day long except the hardcore day drinkers who are regulars
4. Bartenders are often surly or just not interested
5. Never any type of wait staff, sit at the bar and order your drinks
6. Likely do not accept credit cards, cash only
7. Frequented by townies and only the occasional student

Think of Lions Lair or Nob Hill in Denver for comparison. 

So... Does Boulder have any dive bars of this definition? Thank you very much for your insight.

I have a friend, from Mexico, who makes me the most delicious home cooked Mexican food. This has kicked off a new love affair between me and this cuisine that I had been bored with previously.

I live between Boulder and Longmont. I spend a lot of time in Denver and have found Taco de Mexico (on Santa Fe) to be my favorite so far. In Longmont I've tried Santiago's and Efrain's. I like them both, but I know that Longmont must have some even more authentic places to eat.

Unfortunately, I don't speak Spanish... but I can try pantomiming if necessary. I don't mind grungy hole-in-the-wall places but I don't want to get sick. Maybe there's even a guy with a cooler who stands in the street that you know about.

I'm also trying to learn to cook it, but somehow my whiteness has learned how to sneak it's way into the pan.

I'm visiting Boulder this weekend, and my husband and I are always interested in trying local cuisine that helps to define a region. So I was wondering if there are any awesome region-specific food things I should make sure to try while I'm there. For example, if you go to Memphis you gotta get BBQ, pizza and bagels in NYC, tacos in Southern California, etc etc. What crazy-awesome food thing is the best in Boulder? 

Thanks in advance!

**EDIT!**
Sorry for the spam, I just wanted to say a big **THANK YOU** to everyone who chimed in with suggestions for our Boulder trip. We took your excellent advice and hit up as many breweries as we could (Avery was by far the favorite, and we also went to Oskar Blues in Lyons, Left Hand, Mountain Sun, and Boulder Beer), so those destinations definitely informed much of our dining. Had some great food as well at Foolish Craig's and The Buff. And a special thanks for the couple folks who suggested a smothered burrito; that's definitely something I don't see on the east coast, and was a cool thing to seek out. Oh, and we stopped at the Savory Spice Shop to pick up some gifts for friends and for ourselves (so me and my friends thank you for that one).

And finally, the reason for our trip was to see if we would enjoy living in Boulder, and we've decided that we're moving to Boulder in the Fall!

We're not dead set on Boulder as it seems fairly pricey but would love to be somewhere close to both Boulder and not *too* far from Denver. The closer to Boulder, the better. So, I have a few questions:

* What communities would you guys recommend for a fairly active, young couple looking to start a family in the near future?
* I've been job searching pretty hard and haven't had bad luck. I just started last week and have had no trouble finding things to apply for, but I'd love any info on what locals would recommend for entry level work for a BS in Economics. 
* How is the housing market? 
* I love craft beer, cycling, and the outdoors. Colorado sort of looks like heaven. Seriously, there have to be some drawbacks to Boulder/CO in general. What are they?

Lego Harry Potter*

Puerto Rico (mildly racist, apparently)*

Go (We're still learning)*

Chess*


*These are compact enough that public spaces would work

Where are there coffee shops with large tables or the ability to cram some together?
