1330397349.0,36,self.hiking,q93et,Court rules that Forest Service can't charge a fee if all you're doing is parking and hiking,treefern,42,6,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/q93et/court_rules_that_forest_service_cant_charge_a_fee/,"On Feb. 9, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Forest Service couldn't charge a fee for simply parking at a trailhead and hiking. The Forest Service's authority to charge fees is limited by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, which prohibits charging fees to persons who simply park at a developed site without using any amenities, but only walk through it to hike trails. 

The Forest Service may only charge a fee for use of sites that contain all of the following amenities: permanent toilet; permanent trash receptacle; developed parking; interpretive sign or kiosk; picnic table; and security services. But, if you're not using any of these amenities, and you're simply walking through, FS has no authority to charge you for parking there. The court rejected Forest Service's argument that it could charge a fee simply for making the amenities available, stating that the law ""clearly contemplates that individuals can go to a place offering facilities and services without using the facilities and services and without paying a fee.""  The court also rejected Forest Service's argument that it could charge a fee for picnicking in undeveloped areas that are ""in the vicinity"" of developed sites.

The case involved fees charged on the Coronado National Forest in Arizona, but the ruling applies to all national forests within the Ninth Circuit, which includes Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Idaho &amp; Montana.  So, if all you're doing is parking at a trailhead, you don't need a Northwest Forest Pass or any of the other Forest Service fee decals.  Just don't use the restroom, toss anything in the trash can, sit down at a picnic table, or read the interpretive signs.

She and I really enjoy it, and so does my dog. I've lurked Hikit for a while now and have come upon a couple of great resources for finding and planning trails (HikingUpward, EveryTrail, etc.), but I could sure use a guide of tips and necessary gear for first-timers.

What are the things a newbie needs to know and look out for? What sorts of dangers should we be mindful of (aside from the obvious of snakes, bears, and wandering off the trail)? It occurred to me yesterday that there are probably scenarios that I haven't thought of that could leave us in danger without our even realizing it, and I would sure like to avoid that if at all possible. What is the essential gear turn-out (currently we go with a cell-phone with GPS/cached maps, water for 2+dog, snacks, compass, pocket knife, trashbags, etc.)? 

Basically I'm looking for a quick-start guide of things we need to take, what the important gear is (I don't think my sneakers and blue jeans are going to do well on a serious trail or for more than a couple of miles), and the things we need to know about avoiding or recovering from any potential bad situation. Any help would be appreciated, and if you're in the Northern VA area, trail recommendations that are dog-friendly would be appreciated also.

Thanks!

There was only one other car there when we arrived and we made our way into the main trail parking area. Along the way another lone hiker had arrived and managed to catch up to us (my wife has asthma and is a touch out of shape so we were taking our time through the snow). We said hello and we chatted for a bit, but it did go a little long and he didn't seem to want to move on. That was fine enough, we're both friendly people and I enjoy talking to others on the trail but even at that point I felt a little uneasy about him. After that we again ran into him at our destination observation deck and this time chatted some more. Something about his body language didn't sit right with me but we talked about other hikes and destinations but again he just seemed ""off"" to me. I have no specific things that I could say caused me to feel some alarm but I did start eyeing up size difference, remembering my knife that I always hike with and suddenly feeling very vulnerable for my wife and I as I'm not a badass by any stretch. I made a casual suggestion that we should really get going so we could get to the top and get home and said our goodbye's. After that and he was out of earshot my wife was clearly uneasy about him as well. Fast forward to getting back down to the trail head and my wife and I are taking pictures of the scenery and even though he had been far ahead of us I see him again watching us by where the cars are parked. After he saw me noticing him (he was probably about 75 yards away, my wife had and still has no clue that he was there) he then turned away and got into his car and drove off. I felt very unnerved by him for some reason and I've hiked a lot of places far more remote and ran into all kinds of characters but never quite had a feeling like that. I always try to give the benefit of the doubt, and told my wife that I've been that lone hiker many times prior and always tried to be aware that I could make others feel vulnerable but I'm just not sure I'm being paranoid or I had genuine cause for concern. I don't have one thing I  particular that set those alarms off in my head but I honestly kept thing after we left that we had dodged a bullet and how things could have gone much differently and my kids might not have seen us again. First time I've had a feeling that after hiking for 12 years now all over the country.

The one thing that my group of friends discovered last year was thermacell. It's a bit bulky and heavy (relatively speaking), but we found that they work so well, it's worth carrying. We have 3 people each carry one, then once we get to camp, we make a triangle perimeter around us and it works quite well.... Unfortunately, they are of no use at all when on the move....

I think I'm addicted.,infidelappel,31,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/u9oop/went_on_my_first_real_hike_today_i_think_im/,"On a whim, I went hiking Breakneck Ridge in New York State (about 60 miles north of NYC) with a couple friends. The 'leader' of our trio goes rock climbing on occasion and has hiked this trail before; the other two of us had never done any such thing.


I haven't found the exact distance measure of our total hike (it was only about 7 miles from what I've gathered from the trail maps), and the highest summit (grumble grumble who puts a flag one third of the way up? grumble) where we switched trails from a rock scramble to a woods trail was just over 1600' of total elevation.


I am astounded that I was able to make it, to be honest. I'm somewhat active, but admittedly out of shape. I work out and play hockey infrequently. I never thought I could haul myself up a rock face, but I did. It was amazing, and when we finally reached the THIRD summit I was rewarded with gorgeous views of the Hudson river and the chance to photograph some hawks.


This hiking business is awesome. How should I go about getting more into it? My first step is to get a real pack. My cheesy K-mart backpack had a strap rip off halfway up and slinging it around one shoulder was choking me for the rest of the ascent. Also, sweating became quite an issue...what apparel would you all recommend to stay cooler/drier?

I have a few questions.   I'm taking my mom, she's Peruvian, but never been to MP, so I'm giving her a once in a lifetime travel MP.    Probably taking an Aunt/cousin there to keep us company.

I'm looking to do the 1 day hike to MP.   If I understand correctly, I need to start from Aguas Calientes and take a couple of hours before reaching MP.    My mom is close to 70 years old, I don't want my mom doing this hike with me.   I'll be doing that by myself.   Here are my questions:

- Do I need permission for the one day hike?   I've been reading I need to pay a fee for the 4 day Inca Trail, but nothing on the one day hike, so not sure.

- If I was by myself, I don't mind staying in a hostel, but with my mom, I want something more respectable, does anybody knows of places in Aguas Calientes? (online I find mostly Hostels)

- How long do I have to be in Cusco/Aguas Calientes to acclimate to altitude?  Specially since I want to hike?   I'm usually a hiker in the US (New Hampshire, Massachusetts), but nothing extreme.

- Any ideas on the plane to Cusco and train to Aguas Calientes?   This wont' be a proper hiking trip, so I need to know when can I leave Aguas Calientes.

- If I see Macchu Picchu on Monday morning can I make it to Cusco and fly back to Lima on that Monday or wait til Tuesday?   Stay in Aguas Calientes that night or can I make it back to Cusco?

I tried asking /r/travel, but they didn't help, I'm hoping for better luck here.

Thanks.

I'm sure most of you here know how busy that mountain can get, particularly with large groups. 

There were two relatively large groups on the mountain that day, which was a quick reminder why I'm not a huge fan of the White Dot Trail. I was thinking since it was midweek it wouldn't be too bad, but of course I was wrong. 

On my way up I came across a group of four kids, about 11-12 years old. I took a breather a little ways behind them and overheard them saying their teacher told them that this mountain was easy. I looked around and didn't see any adults around, which I was particularly shocked by. I moved along and came across yet another group of kids that were with the same teacher, and one girl was freaking out. Her friends seemed to have a handle on her so I moved along. 

This next one is what absolutely blew my mind. I was getting towards where the steep part of the White Dot is easing up, and there was this kid all by himself. He was probably around the same age as the schoolchildren; he was no older than 13 years old. He was out of shape and out of breath. I talked to him a little bit and he was asking me if the whole mountain was like this, how high we were, how much longer, etc. Turns out this kid was with a scout troop. I was never in the Boy Scouts or anything by my head nearly exploded. A scout leader just left this poor kid behind by himself? This might be the military in me coming out, but something done as a group should be done as a group. If one person in your party is having a tough time, you slow down for them or turn around and go back. You certainly don't leave them all by themselves, especially a young kid! I ended up passing the troop leader on my way up as he was making his way down, and I'll tell you I was very, very close to saying something to him.

So, fellow hikers, my question is what should I do if I encounter a situation like this? I really didn't want to stick around with the kid, but I wish I said something to the troop leader. Has anyone else ever encountered something like this before?",,False,,t5_2r9om,False,,,True,t3_1gp34o,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/1gp34o/question_on_etiquette_for_hikers/,

Purchasing this insurance will cover you in many regions accross many service providers. $45 (Roughly $80 for a family package) is a very small price to pay and even if you don't use it, it helps keep these amazing services running.

1340090113.0,20,self.hiking,v9m41,Three good reasons to stop complaining about hiking boots.,Tealwisp,29,9,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/v9m41/three_good_reasons_to_stop_complaining_about/,"Every time someone brings up a pair of hiking boots, it's inevitable that the top comment is someone complaining about the boots and how there's everything wrong with them.  So, here's three good reasons to shut up and let the man or woman wear the boots:

1. [Morton's toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton%27s_toe)
This is a foot shape characterized by a shortened first metatarsal, and is one part of Morton's Triad: three phenotypes of this inherited trait.  What that means is that the second toe sticks out farther than the second.  It changes the way weight is distributed on your foot, putting a lot of pressure on your second toe instead of the first.  A boot with a stiff ankle moves a bit of the leverage to the back of your foot and your ankle, which can make a hike a dozen times more comfortable.  The laces on the ankle also help to hold your heel in the back of the boot, which stops your short toe from banging the front (this can cause long-term health problems).  The only real plusses to this foot shape are prehensile toes and knowing that the ancient Greeks thought you had pretty feet.

2. [Morton's Neruoma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton%27s_neuroma)
This is a much more troublesome condition.  Insofar as I understand it, there is a nerve pinched behind the second toe.  When it's symptomatic, every step is a shot of pain up your leg (think static  discharge, but much stronger, going from your toe up through your ankle).  They only way to prevent symptoms is by wearing the right shoes.  For women, no heels, only flats.  For men, this means wearing shoes that fit in the right dimensions (different people are vulnerable to different kinds of compression).  The fit needs to walk a very, very fine line between loose enough to fit well, but tight enough not to fall off.  For me, a shoe needs to be wide around my toes.  Most shoes that fit me aren't made that way, so I have to leave the lower laces really loose, sometimes all the way up to the arch of my foot; I even unlace the lower portions entirely sometimes.  Since I can't get a very snug fit around my arch, I have to make up for it around my ankle and heel.  Without those extra laces that go up the ankle, my boots are really only secured at one point, and not very well.  

3. The last, and probably best, reason to stop complaining about other people's hiking boots is that they might just like the feel of it.  If they want to deal with the extra ounces, fine.  That just means they'll be picking up a little more weight.  I get used to it every winter when I have to break out a pair of boots that weigh 700 grams each (for my fellow Americans, that's about a pound and a half).  After that, a boot that weighs a third as much is nothing.

**TL;DR stop complaining about other people wearing boots.  They're not ""the cancer that's killing hiking.""**",,False,,t5_2r9om,False,,,True,t3_v9m41,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/v9m41/three_good_reasons_to_stop_complaining_about/,

I'm going to be graduating from college at the end of April, and I am thinking about a N-S thru hike of the Appalachian Trail. So here’s the thing; I have no hiking experience, and am pretty broke. Is it even feasible to complete a thru hike with &lt;$1000? I have no gear, so that would take even more out of the money I currently have. If it is possible, are there any tips that experienced hikers can give to a noob like me?
Seeing as how I have such a low budget, what would be the best foods to pack, keeping in mind that I would like to minimize weight as well? Also, I have seen some gear lists on the internet, but I would like to know exactly what the absolute essentials are? Any knowledge on something that I may have missed would also be appreciated.

This is a slightly lengthy read, so if you have a short attention span (I'd be very surprised if this is the case in this subreddit), please move along. 

Basically, I'm a guy who used to hike all the time, who hasn't hiked a lot in the last 5 years or so, and in less than 3 weeks, I'm about to embark on a one week (120 kilometers) hike on Western Australia's famous ""Bibbulmun Track"".  I HAVE been preparing, as much as I can with my day job, done a few 10 - 12k hikes with minimal inconvenience, so I am fairly confident I can tackle the distances involved on a day to day basis on the Bib. 

What I really need advice on is a few more practical measures. 

Most notably : FOOD. 

First of all, as far as cooking equipment I'll be carrying, all I intend to carry is a Jetboil stove and a few cans of gas, along with a pan to cook things on (who knows, I might catch a rabbit or a fish), and that's about it. 

This will be my first time hiking for seven days, alone. 

I plan to take with me : Dehydrated food packets for dinner (a well known New Zealand camp food brand that are extremely well balanced meals with around 1500kjs of energy per pack), Soup ""Shot"" packets bought at a camping store (around 500kjs per pack) as energy snacks for throughout the day, Beef Jerky (around 1000kj's for 2 packs) for breakfast - along with coffee, and then a few sticks of salami to chew on throughout for salt/fat, a jar of honey for natural sugars, and trail mix to chew on as I walk. 

My general question to this subreddit is kind of twofold : What am I missing, if anything? And is there any kind of ""superfood"" that you recommend, that is lightweight, and nutritionally too hard to look past for a hiker on a seven day, 120km walk? 

I look forward to hearing your hiking nutrition/good food ideas. ",,False,,t5_2r9om,False,,,True,t3_1f2x14,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/1f2x14/call_for_general_nutrition_advice_for_an_120km/,

Not too unlike anything that we've done in the past. However, about half way through she really started slowing down and limping. When I looked at her paws they were totally blistered and raw. I didn't think it was going to be too warm for her (high temp was 86 degrees) but I had neglected to take into consideration the heat of the trail. 

Poor girl. Thankfully I always hike with a first aid kit and was able to bandage her up well enough to get back to the car. I have her on antibiotics and pain medication to be safe. She'll be wrapped up for a few days while her paws heal. 

Please don't make the same mistake I did. Always protect your dogs paws, especially in warm/cold weather. From now on, she'll be in boots for every hike.

I've looked a the SPOT Satellite GPS Messenger, but it's gotten poor reviews for longevity,and costs money to subscribe to yearly -- which I'd like to avoid.

I've been hiking for about six-seven years now. I live in Westchester so the majority of my hikes have been in the West/East Hudson areas. Hiking is a family activity for me and we're probably going to venture to the Catskills this summer.

Hiking is perhaps my greatest passion. Nothing comes close to the challenge, excitement, satisfaction, awe I experience while on a trail. One of my life goals is to hike the Appalachian Trail. So far the hikes I've done include Bear Mt, Black Mt, Crow's Nest, Beacon Mt, Dunderberg, Mt Taurus, and The Labyrinth/Crevice at Mohonk among many others.

I was told by a ranger office in Linville gorge that I didn't need a permit for backcountry camping in the national park so long as it was outside Linville gorge.   

**Does anyone know if I'm allowed to make a fire anywhere I want in the national park?**

I haven't gone camping in a long time - usually just day hikes, and to be honest, I'm kinda turned off to the entire thing.  I had to call like 3-4 numbers first, some of which weren't even active.  The park websites are not easy to understand or navigate, and 2 out of 3 rangers I spoke too acted like pricks.  You have to reserve permits weeks in advance.... and you can get fined up to $5000 if you don't.

1343731659.0,15,self.hiking,xfyyu,Putting the slowest walker first.,great_scotty,23,8,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/xfyyu/putting_the_slowest_walker_first/,"Hi Hiking, I just wrote a blog/fb post and wanted to know if you agree before I post it elswhere.

Putting the slowest first

I was talking to someone about always putting the slowest memer of the party first this week and I realised I wasn't articulating myself terribly well so I thought I'd write it down instead. When I was doing walking holidays with cadets it was always emphasised that the slowest member of the party gets put at the front. I've been away with others quite a lot and having experienced being both the strongest and weakest member of the group, I've appreciated the importance of it even more.

The main reason given is safety, and that seems obvious but it isn't always. If someone stops due to injury, equipment failure, fatigue, urgent call of nature etc, then those out at the front won't necessarily see or hear about it if there is even a modest gap(with cycling that is even more difficult). Unless you're proactively looking behind you to check, it could be several minutes before anyone realises someone is having issues which is easily enough time for them to be out of sight, at which point people will wait a fair amount of time before retracing steps. If someone needs help, that delay could be harmful.

Navigation is obviously important, if you go out of sight of the rest of the party, the weaker members could easily take a wrong turn and the party could get separated. The problem there is that without having the fastest in sight, there isn't really any way of knowing if you're on the wrong path or not. How far will the less experienced members continue on an incorrect path without seeing the rest of the group before turning back?

It could be argued that as long as the party stays tightly together, then it doesn't matter where the slowest goes. It is extremely difficult for those at the front to constantly check back to the slower members and adjust the pace accordingly, especially when tired, hungry, cold or miserable. It may be manageable for short periods but I know from personal experience that it is draining. Placing the slowest at the front and fastest at the back naturally causes the group to stay tightly together, the bigger the difference between fastest and slowest, the better it works.

Aside from safety, there are a few other considerations which wouldn't be obvious to many.

If the stronger members of the group go off ahead of the weaker members, they invariably have to stop and wait for the rest before heading off again. That means that the weaker members of the group who need breaks the most always get the shortest break, which then widens the gap in fatigue and pace even further. That is frustrating for both the quickest and the slowest.

The whole group will make better progress and get there quicker if the slowest member is at the front. Each time the group sets off as a whole, the person at the front sets the pace for everyone else. Gaps form when that pace is too fast for some. It is far more efficient for the weakest to go at a pace which is most comfortable and sustainable for them rather than set off too fast each time, then fatigue and have to stop. You can't get there any quicker than the weakest member so it is in everyone's interest to give the weakest their optimal pace.

When out walking and cycling, someone has to make decisions on where you go. It is often the most experienced out at the front navigating and the rest following. I think that if you're more experienced than the rest of the group, it is your responsibility to give them the experience which you have had and empower them to be able to go out without you and do it themselves. If you put the map in the hands of the less experienced members, it lets them assess a situation first, figure out when you are, look for paths themselves and take a bearing. You don't gain those skills by someone explaining to you what they've just done, you get them by doing it yourself and THEN explaining it back to the more experienced member to check if you're unsure. If you have a struggling member of the party arrive at a decision point after the stronger members. All the interesting work has usually been done and a decision taken, aside from them missing opportunities to build those skills, it's pretty dis-empowering.

Being the most experienced in the group means that there is plenty of advice and support you can give to others. Walking behind less experienced members gives you the opportunity to see what they are doing and how their equipment is performing and be able to advise and guide. In addition, you can also see by watching how someone walks or rides if they are starting to struggle so you can take breaks before they have to ask the group to stop. People often won't tell you they have a problem until its unbearable, if you can spot issues early(like someone limping), they are far more preventable.

Morale plays a huge part in someone's ability to keep going when they're tired,hungry, cold or wet so it affects the pace of the group. If morale is low then it also means that your friends are having a miserable time, and they're not going to want to go and do things with you again. The strongest members are far less sensitive to it so they are in the best position to make sure it is kept up for others. There are a few things about putting the slowest first that affect morale.

I have seen first had that taking someone who is straggling at the back and putting them up at the front gives them a massive boost in morale and they are much better able to keep it up. It can get pretty depressing seeing the people you are with have to constantly all stop and wait for YOU. It's not difficult for whomever is at the back to start to feel like they are holding everyone back and shouldn't be there, or start to resent those at the front for constantly leaving them behind. Either way, it can potentially lead to someone having a completely miserable holiday.

You can often tell who is struggling by who goes quiet, which obviously makes sense. When you're all facing forward and the group is tight, the members at the back can be heard by everyone but the ones at the front, unless they turn around, can only be heard by those immediately behind them. If you're breathing hard trying to keep up with the group and they are up ahead laughing and joking and enjoying themselves, then even if the group does stays together, you can't hear them. If the strongest members are at the back laughing and joking, then everyone can hear and at least be included, even if they can't always contribute. Some of the most memorable jokes of walking holidays have been when out walking. I would hate to think that some of the group could have been isolated from social side of walking because they happened to be at the back.

I only point these things out because I've made nearly all of these mistakes at various points in the past. If I'd read something like this earlier then I would have been less likely to make them.

I am a software engineer but also love hiking.  I first started writing this app for windows mobile to use for my own hiking trips but have since got an android phone so I decided to port it over and make it better.

Basically it is a GPS recording application.  It will record your hikes and create a google map for you to share.  Here are some more features:

-Compass with waypoints (to help you find your car or something if you get lost)
-Altitude graph
-Placemarkers
-Speed
-Multiple trails per hike

Here is a link to the trial version:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geo.blaze.lite&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5nZW8uYmxhemUubGl0ZSJd

The restrictions on the free version are:

-Can only save 3 trips
-Can only save 3 waypoints
-Can't share trips (since it uploads files to my server)

If you guys download the lite version and like it.  Just send me a message and I will send you a link to the full version for free.  I wish I could put a coupon on the paid version but the android market doesn't let me.

Let me know what you think.

The problem is my only repertoire is day-hikes and walks. The longest I've done was a two day hike in an island. It wasn't planned and we ended up sleeping on a beach.

Looking at some of the European Trails, I realize how much I don't know about hiking and long distance walking. But I would like to study up on the matter and learn as much as possible before trying anything.

So I'm wondering what sort of advice would you have for someone who is looking to start. Anything would be of great help. Some reading on things to do, things not to do, equipment, etc.

And where do you usually sleep? Do you look for hostels, hotels, or pack a tent with you? Is it legal/acceptable/safe to use a tent along the trails? I know that it is illegal to camp in some places, especially if it's a protected park.

I've also read a bit online, but I would like to get more input. So feel free to share your thoughts on what exactly would you consider to be the difference be between Hiking/Trekking/Long Distance Walking?

EDIT: Also, I'm thinking of doing this by myself. I don't think there would be many people willing to join me on this. What type of advice would you have for long solo hikes?",,False,,t5_2r9om,True,,,True,t3_tmxnu,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/tmxnu/beginners_guide_to_hiking/,

This weekend, I was climbing a 14er (Mt Elbert) in Colorado, and had a lot of trouble when I got to summit. My phone died from a cold battery, and it was being used as my GPS navigation to get back to my car. It was 100% charged when I left, but only lasted about 3 to 4 hours in the cold.

Well, a snowstorm blew in, I got lost, and ended up around 15 to 20 miles away from my car in the wrong direction. Long story short: I lucked out and a sheriff found me as I was building a shelter on the side of the road to stay the night in the snowstorm. The shelter I was making probably wouldn't have been enough. I was an idiot and didn't pack in a map and compass.

EDIT: [Blog post about my hiking adventure](http://jeffstagg.com/hike-camp/mount-elbert/)

I need a GPS that will last through the cold. Now, I've been using my phone with MyTracks (android app that tracks my trail and integrates with Google Maps), and it's been outstanding in the summer. I'd love to find another GPS that will integrate with Google maps so that I can keep a record of my journeys attached to my Google account. I've been recommended to get a Garmin, but I can't find anywhere that says if I can export my Garmin-tracked trails to Google maps. Does anyone know if this is possible, or if there is a GPS that would allow me to do this that is more accurate and more durable than my Droid?

Thanks!

The trails are pretty narrow, usually only enough room for one person.  I was so close to the observatory when I heard a rattle from a bush I just passed.  I looked back and there was a rattlesnake coiled up under the bush.  I went ahead with my hike and less than a mile later, another rattlesnake, but since I was running, this one seemed more surprised and moved around in the bushes and made a hissing noise.  It happened pretty fast.  I don't know if it tried to strike at me or retreated.  But I was already jumpy from the first snake. I ran backwards and tried to get the hell out of there as fast as I could.  The rest of my hike down, I was so paranoid about encountering the first snake again.  I had a long stick and was hitting the bushes in front of me and tapping the ground.  I don't even know if this was a good idea.

If I spot a snake under the bush before I cross it, am I supposed to scare it away with a rock or stick or something?  Wouldn't that aggravate it more and be more likely to strike later?  And do they sell anti venom just to have for emergencies?  I was thinking if I got bit, I'm a good 2 hours from the bottom.

edit: To clarify, I would have loved to just go around it, but the trail is on a steep mountain.  So one side will slope up and the other side is more like a cliff.  like this picture from [yelp 1](http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VpAlzRktffjjbeJ7azwD6g?select=QDBUHGQz4399Vo8R4k9zrw#QDBUHGQz4399Vo8R4k9zrw), [2](http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VpAlzRktffjjbeJ7azwD6g?select=CbV_cu95tkcdVlhVb8DwBA#CbV_cu95tkcdVlhVb8DwBA), [3](http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VpAlzRktffjjbeJ7azwD6g?select=HWVHBFCePMJXy3nAA-A0dw#HWVHBFCePMJXy3nAA-A0dw)  And really, I do keep a watchful eye, but these snakes are damned hard to spot under the shade coiled up under a bush and rock.

I have a lot of questions and while I know this subreddit sees a lot of new hiker posts, I don't want my dad and my dogs to turn into a cautionary tale.

My dad refuses to acknowledge that he has a bad knee. Are there any boots, knee braces or gear I can direct him toward that can help his knee without it being too obvious? He's not crippled by it, but he'll occasionally fall when he puts weight on it, and he's determined to prove to me that he's still the young buck that he was in the military. Not that he's not tough, but still. I worry, and I think his ego is getting in the way of his safety.

Two: he wants to bring the dogs, which I'm not against. Do you guys have any recommendations about packing food, general do's and don'ts and how to recognize signs that they may smell something we don't (like a bear?) The dogs are two healthy boxers, in case that's relevant.

I know how to fit a pack and measure my spine, but I was wondering if there was any pack between 35-55L in particular that anyone would recommend for a 5'3"" 130# woman. I found an Osprey that I liked from REI, but I figure second opinions can't hurt.

My roommate and I have been gearing up, exercising, slimming down, and preparing for the Colorado Trail.  We are going to attempt the CT this summer, at a 30 mile per day pace.  We'll be using a mix between trail running and hiking.  We expect to maintain an average pace of 3 mph.  For the summer hike, we want to finish 483 miles in just over two weeks.

This is spring break, and we've been waiting for this moment.  We've set aside three days to accomplish 90 miles on a trail system around a local lake.  Each loop takes us 30 miles.  We've been gearing up for this, we are ready.

One final detail: there is a 100% chance of rain in the area tomorrow.  So now, we face strong winds and warm rains.  Neither of us directly prepared for this, but we always knew it was a possibility.  We are still setting out tomorrow, we hit the trail at sunrise.  We've added a few items to our pack list to compensate for the rain.

I'll update this in a few days, once we get back.  I'm curious to know how our chosen gear works out.  I'm also excited to see how well my knee holds out.  I'm just over 30 years old, and a year ago I was 200 pounds.  Today, I'm down to 171 pounds, and the knee has been doing much better.

MSR Hyperflow filter
REI Quarterdome Plus Tents
25 degree synthetic sleeping bags
minimal clothing though everything is lightweight UPF 50+

2 Nalgenes each
50 ft. of Cordellete

I've been looking at the Zion National Park in Utah and it looks beautiful specially since it offers lots of different terrains. But it appears to only have short trails. 

Can anyone offer any suggestions for parks and trails?

A few of my concerns are that I will be travelling alone as a woman, I want to be sure that this route is safe, although from what I've heard you make friends on these kind of things. 

I kind of wanted to avoid a commercial tour as I don't like the idea of travelling in a big group (maybe an exception if it's a smaller group of students) but I'm up for suggestions. 

I wanted to stick to around 4 - 7 days, but I don't know for sure as I'm not too experienced with this stuff. 

If anyone has any hiking-related ressources to share I would love that! 

Other stuff I thought I would share: I did the Cinque Terre walk in Italy last year, that was probably the most intensive hike I've ever done. My family got to the third or fourth city before turning back.
