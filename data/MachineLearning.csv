I have an app that does exactly this, published before they filed their application. What do?",ohell,137,20,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1d899i/google_have_this_week_been_granted_a_very_broad/,"[My app uses machine learning to predict people you are likely to call](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.lipik.ai_dial), as a way of enhancing the phone dialer.

[Google's shiny new patent](http://www.google.com/patents/US8429103) gives them the exclusive right to use machine learning on phones (claim 1). Amongst other things, they claim it can be used to predict people you are likely to call (claim 9).

I know about not being evil etc, but this is such a broad patent - and not really novel. I am struggling to understand how a non-evil researcher/engineer would have written the application (I never considered my app to contain anything patentable) - they have essentially claimed rights to the use of machine learning services on phones. So, nobody can make an adaptive app for and phone platform, if Google objects!

I know about the rational for defensive patenting, but still, they have claimed an invention where none exists (they do not have any demonstrated products using this yet - and even if they did, it would not really be invention), and they have subjected all AI implementers to seek their consent before developing!

I am not in America, but my app is on app store. I am wondering what would be the best course of action to take? Ideally, I'd like to show my app as very obvious prior art, and get them to donate the patent to EFF or something.

I tried many books on Machine Learning but it wasn't easy to find the right one.

Bishop's ""Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"" is a very hard read. In my opinion, the problem is not the material but the exposition. Many derivations are left to the reader and there are too many ""it's trivial to see"", ""it can be readily seen"" and ""after some straightforward algebra"". In the end, I gave up.

""The Elements of Statistical Learning"" (Hastie et al.) suffers from the same problems. Moreover, some explanations I couldn't follow because they referred to concepts I wasn't familiar with. All these books claim that you just need to know some calculus, probability and linear algebra, but that's a lie. Bishop even tries to teach you basic probability, suggesting that his book can be read by one who doesn't know probability, which is absurd.

The lessons by Andrew Ng are easy to follow but they're not very deep. They show you a collection of techniques but they don't provide the theory that should guide you in using these techniques. Also, many techniques are presented in their simplest form.
The lectures by Tom Mitchell are also very easy to follow but I think he oversimplifies things. By the way, he says that after taking his course one can do research and read papers without problems. I wish it was that easy.

The same material can be presented at very different levels and I found out that there is a noticeable gap between elementary texts and lessons, and advanced ones. I was looking for something advanced but at the same time accessible. In my opinion, a text can be advanced and at the same time introductory. Introductory should mean that no prior knowledge of the topic is assumed. Many books claim to be introductory but they're not. Some explanations are so cryptic that only one with a prior exposure to the material would benefit from them.

Finally, I found the right book for me: Pattern Classification (Duda, Hart, Stork, 2ed.). The book doesn't shy away from advanced material and the explanations are great. Finally, a book that I can study on my own without having to rely on somebody else for additional explanations!

In the end, I decided to train independent supervised classifiers for the post's title text and its domain, and combined the two probability estimates for each subreddit to arrive at a holistic score for the post. I experimented with several types of classifier models (logistic regression, stochastic gradient descent, and naive bayes), and used the one-vs-all approach  to generalize the first two model types to handle more than two subreddits. Unfortunately, I did not have as much time as I hoped to explore the various avenues of this project (partially because I spent too long playing around with PCA and LDA, partially because I ended up spending more time than I wanted to on other classes), but I still feel I managed to get some decent results (which were comparable with the Prediction API results). 

You can read my [project report](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/700763/229a_project.pdf) for more details about the exact implementation. Although it lacks any real figures because of the class-imposed 5 page limit, you can see some sample results in [this table](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/700763/table.pdf). You can also see the title text classifier features with the highest coefficients for each subreddit in [this table](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/700763/words.pdf), which can be thought of as the strongest indicators that a post should belong in that respective subreddit. Finally, you can see the code that I wrote for this project on [github](https://github.com/smoreinis/classificator), which also contains a data directory with a script to scrape new posts from Reddit (inspired by the same post from Nick Johnson) and some sample data for people to play around with.

Code Miscellany: This code was written in python, and uses the numpy, scipy, simplejson, Stemmer, sklearn packages (and in fact was based on an sklearn tutorial on classifying newsgroup articles). The extract.py file handles the conversion of a JSON file full of posts into a feature dictionary, while models.py handles the actual supervised classification models provided by sklearn (as well as using CV grid search to find optimal parameters, and the CombinedClassifier which provides overall score posts). The gold.py file runs the whole thing - give it json files as arguments, and it should spit out the results for each type of sklearn classifier, which include a confusion matrix, overall F1-score, and a classification report like seen above. Finally, you can use the --topFeatures flag to print the highest coefficients (as seen above), but only if you are classifying on title text only (which is the way the code is set up now). To change it to classify posts based on title text and domain, change default value of combine to True on line 153 in models.py, comment out lines 173 an 178 in gold.py, and uncomment lines 174 and 177 (this is one of those things I'd have refactored to be prettier if I had the time, but hopefully it's not too confusing).

I hope this can be of use to some of you - it seems there are several people trying to build recommendation systems for posts, so maybe this can provide at least a little insight into how much information can be gained from a post's title and domain. Although all posts are currently uniformly weighted when training the supervised classifiers, changing this weighting (to either reflect the post's number of upvotes, or some personalized ranking) could also yield some interesting results and potentially make the model's results even better. Let me know if there are any questions!",,False,self,t5_2r3gv,True,,,True,t3_nm1d4,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/nm1d4/show_rml_classifying_new_posts_into_subreddits/,

I'm about to start a PHD in the fall in computer science focusing on Machine Learning and Information Extraction. I am aware that faculty positions are hard to come by and may not be the best fit for me in the future, and I was wondering what the industry jobs prospects are there for people trained in Machine Learning at the advanced graduate level. 

The program I am accepted into is a well ranked one and has some famous professors in the field I can work with. 

If you have one of these sorts of jobs I would like to know the following:

* Do you regret the time taken to get your PHD?
* Are you happy with your salary?
* Do you find the work stimulating?
* Do you find this sort of work isolating (Could someone who defines themselves as an extrovert work in your job)?
* Is there an ability to move up and progress at your job or is it dead end?

I got all excited in the interview and started telling the manager there how I could use machine learning algorithms to automatically predict which stories would be successful based on the rate of tweets about the story.

When I started describing what machine learning was, the manager interviewing me reacted as if I was describing some magical voodoo. He said things like ""that won't scale"" even though I was only describing running an SVM on a small amount of training data.

They just want to predict simple stuff, but the more I try to clarify what machine learning is, the more skeptical the manager is getting. I think he thinks I'm trying to sell him some sort of snake oil.

I can get in the top 10-20%, but after that my rank stagnates. My template workflow is to process the data(derive every variable I can come up with), partition the data into k-folds or k-stratified-folds, (optionally or separately) perform feature selection, throw every algorithm appropriate from sklearn/scipy/theano-scripts into my model class then bag the models. I do grid-searching on the hyper-parameters for algorithms that perform poorly. I try to keep my individual model fitting time to under 12 hours on my 8-core workstation. I can usually eek out a little more if I run add models ran with more of the features to my bag.

I have a good understanding of many of the algorithms that sklearn implements, but I don't have the foggiest clue how this knowledge could help me except in something like diagnosing stochastic gradient descent. I've implemented a couple(slower and less pretty) versions of them. I've worked through Elements of Statistical Learning. I've well-versed in hypothesis testing and visualizing data(my job). I don't know where to go from here. I thought I was pretty good at building models, but I am humbled by the leaderboard.

Many people expressed concern about the fitness I would choose. I ended up looking for a few long-period cycles in the results, as well as large variation between values. I hoped this would create a more complicated and dynamic sound, which it mostly does.

I'm currently having an issue where some high fitness sentences generated from my program result in completely boring music, and haven't quite figured out how to solve it, but it still produces other high fitness sentences which are interesting.

A few that I've picked out so far for being particularly interesting are these, which look much different than anything I've made by hand.

( t * ( t ^ ( ( t &gt;&gt; 7 ) / 7 ) ) )
( t * ( ( 5 - t ) &gt;&gt; ( t ^ ( t - 9 ) ) ) )

As mentiond in the title, the project contains implementations for a neural network, a genetic algorithm, some statistics functions (mean, variance, covariance, pearson's R2) and a linear scaling method for shifting data. 

I haven't paid much attention to design yet (lost a lot of time reading about rprop and levenberg-marquardt methods for ann training - hopefully they will be implemented soon), but the code is fairly simple so maybe it'll be useful to anyone looking for some code samples.

I have a decent coding background but I wasn't able to understand the syntax of R so I need to find a good tutorial or book to help me learn, probably from the near begining. 

In our first assignment we were supposed to use RWeka and DMwR libraries but even after seeing the solution I still don't understand the code and syntax.

For our project we are to be pre-processing lots of text (which I could easily do in python) and then do ML on it to improve the classification rate. Since it is imbalanced data (10-90) I know I need to deal with stuff such as the area under the curve (which I can't do in Weka).

So please recomend me a good tutorial or book I can get to help me learn the syntax for R that touches upon ML related tasks.

If this goes well I might write a paper about it (though I have no idea where I would submit it).

Here is the basic premise of the problem: 

**Lots of young girls are used as sex slaves/prostitutes in the US. If we examine the ad space of young prostitutes can we help them?**

More details:

Their pimps advertise the girls in many cities all across the country. The pimps might have girls in several cities or move girls between several cities. 

These ads appear online in a variety of publications. These ads often come with telephone numbers and photographs.

The question:

If we scrapped ads from these websites what sort of useful analysis could we do?

So far this is what I have thought of:

Do cluster analysis on the text of the ads to see which ads were posted by the same person. Essentially this is an unsupervised learning algorthm being applied to the data of the ads (photo, text, date/time of posting, location, phone number). It was suggested that I use an [LDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation).  Additionally, there is no need to actually decode the meaning of the ads at this time, but it could be interesting later.

Photo analysis to see which girls are operating in which cities. This has several different possible levels of success: Finding the same picture attached to different ads. Finding similar pictures, i.e., pictures that might have been taken in the same room. Finding the same girls in distinctly different pictures.

What help I would like from r/machinelearning:

How have problems like this been solved in the past. I imagine someone has done analysis on craigslist ads to similar effect, i.e., to find out which ads were posted by the same person. Probably in the name of fraud detection. Can someone point me to some papers on the topic? I am looking myself, but I wouldn't mind the help.

Following the literature over the last few years, it seemed like deep methods like RBMs etc. had a way of leveraging unlabeled data for e.g. a classification task, which is otherwise a task involving labeled data. As far as I understood, pre-training made the network generatively model the data, and when coupled to your classification task (via backpropagating using the labels) this would outperform methods that learnt through the labels alone. 

Then Hinton recently gave his formula for DREDNET, a deep network with rectified linear units and dropout, which seems to be a return to form for supervised neural networks. 

My question, then, is: where does this leave semi-supervised models, particularly Bengio's Deep Generative Stochastic Networks?

1305994734.0,28,self.MachineLearning,hgqdv,I have a short internship doing data mining...and am getting overwhelmed,Tiomaidh,31,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hgqdv/i_have_a_short_internship_doing_data_miningand_am/,"I'm a high school senior, and for my senior project I'm spending 3-4 weeks working at a company that does data mining. I've just finished my first week, and have:

* Read a bunch of online material to get an overview of data mining.

* Read several chapters from [*Data Mining* by Witten and Frank](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Mining-Practical-Techniques-Management/dp/0120884070/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305991819&amp;sr=1-2).

* Played with WEKA, mostly to learn how to use it. (And sworn at the ARFF file format).

* Worked a bit with MS SQL Server and Excel PowerPivot.

* Installed Excel's Data Mining plugin.

There's a *lot* of data for the project, but I myself have downloaded and am working with six databases, each of which has approximately six million rows. It's about some pretty complex engines, and has several years' worth of readings from several dozen sensors. I think it's supposed to be tied to events (engine turns on, turns off, overheats, fails, etc.) but that column is blank.

Recently, I had the following conversation:

&gt;Me: I have all the software installed and more-or-less know how to use it. So...what am I supposed to be *doing*?

&gt;Boss: Oh, just play around with the databases and see what you learn.

&gt;Me: Well, I started doing that, but I feel like I can't really discover anything useful without having the readings tied to events...

&gt;Boss: No, there's a lot you can learn without the events.

&gt;Me: I mean, while learning WEKA I made really trivial observations, like, ""The temperature and pressure have a strong positive correlation"", but--

&gt;Boss: No, that's a good thing to know!

&gt;Me: Oh, well, um, okay.

For reference, here's a simplified version of the data I have:


Timestamp| SensorID  | Value | Unit
----------|----------|---     |
1/1/01 0:01| 1          | 478    | PSI
1/1/01 0:01| 2          | 50 | Ft/sec
1/1/01 0:01| 3          | 0 | 0=off; 1=on
1/1/01 3:23| 1          | 485 | PSI
1/1/01 3:23| 2          | 55 | Ft/sec
1/1/01 3:23| 3          | 1 | 0=off; 1=on


And here are my problems:

* I have a number of issues with actually manipulating the data into a useful form. I can figure it out eventually, it's just not streamlined at all. If you're interested, [here](http://pastebin.com/mj4epk8N)'s a description.

* I feel like I'm obsessing over stuff like my ARFF files just because I'm not actually sure what I'm going to do with them once they've actually been loaded into WEKA. It's also a much easier problem to solve, and tricks me into feeling productive when I do solve it.

* My boss told me to read up on Naive Bayesian classifiers, which I did, so I'm probably the most knowledgeable about how to classify stuff. However, as far as I know, I have no classes in which to put stuff (if I had the EventIDs, I'd imagine it'd be massively useful to be able to classify things into events...) I'm actually a bit unsure about what I *could* do...I guess I could make a model to predict the reading of one sensor based on the readings of the other--but when would that be useful? If you can get all but one reading, odds are you can get the last one too. I guess I could also try to predict stuff based on the previous readings (which would probably be useful, actually)...but without knowing if the engine is on or off or whatever, I'm guessing it wouldn't be as accurate as one would hope.

* Ooh, I guess I could discretize everything, and *then* I could classify stuff, right? Is this a good idea?

So I'm unclear about what my objective is, and I have only a shallow knowledge about how to achieve any objective I might have.

In case it's useful--I *do* know how to program (in Python, Java (I even have a Real Job doing Java development), and Lisp (I won prizes for a pretty cool genetic algorithm that generates AIs for games)), I took AP Statistics (which so far has not been remotely useful, unfortunately). I'm just quite clearly in very new territory (and don't get me wrong--I'm really happy to be learning new things. It's just pretty uncomfortable, too.)

So I'm sorry if this has been kinda long and unfocused. I'm just overwhelmed and am hoping that you guys will have some words of wisdom.

Thanks in advance.


---------------

TL; DR - I have a stack of data that I'm supposed to get information from. The data is readings from sensors on a large engine (and thus has the pressure, temperature, and other parameters from several different locations) taken periodically over the course of several years. There is no *specific* thing I'm trying to find out. I think it'd be useful to be able to take a set of readings and predict the next one, but that's just me--I could be wrong. Rather than blindly running promising-looking algorithms and seeing what happens, I'd like suggestions on what I should be looking for. I'd rather have an objective and then select a method based on it than do it the other way around.",,False,self,t5_2r3gv,True,,,True,t3_hgqdv,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hgqdv/i_have_a_short_internship_doing_data_miningand_am/,

[trained](http://imgur.com/prYlg.png) (learning rate = 0.75, one iteration is one pass through the training data; in this case four input-output pairs)

**Context:** I just finished writing a pretty simple machine learning library targeted at recognizing features in images (right now the only learning algorithm in the lib is an ANN). As far as I know, the 'hello world' of multi-layer ANNs is learning XOR, since the problem of mapping the inputs to the outputs is not linearly separable for that data set.

To accomplish this, I set up a 3-layer ANN with 2 inputs, 3 hidden nodes, and 1 output (all non-output layers have bias nodes added automatically). Activation was accomplished using the generic sigmoid function. It took much less than a tenth of a second for the ANN to learn the data.

I was suddenly intrigued by what the output of the neural net would look like over its full trained domain, so dumped the numbers and generated the graph using **QtiPlot** (probably the best open-source data analysis &amp; plotting software I've ever seen). Result = fucking awesome and elegant, so I thought I'd share.

I was looking through some of the stuff at *Quora* but nothing there feels like ""do this and you'll start to understand machine learning or at least know where to go.""

So what I'm looking for is:

Hey all, 

So I am very familiar with the percpetron, and I just recently learned about LDA. I get that it is an algorithm that finds the best hyperplane unto which to project your data for classification... however, I also understand that the perceptron does the same thing. 

So... why would someone elect to use LDA over the Perceptron? What advantages or disadvantages are there? I am trying to understand how all this fits together. Is it just another technique to so supervised learning?

Would this be better - I don't have a good intuition for how it would differ from the full 500 feature vector? Are there any better techniques or approaches?

&gt;Choose a topic mixture for the document (according to a Dirichlet distribution over a fixed set of K topics). For example, assuming that we have the two food and cute animal topics above, you might choose the document to consist of 1/3 food and 2/3 cute animals.

In the past ten years they have come up over and over in the computational biology literature, but I keep hearing that they are more over-fitted than useful. 


I am asking because I am wondering if using bayesian networks is worth it in my situation:

I have 2000 samples each with a 1000 discrete features that I want to use to predict 1 continuous variable. The hope is that I could build up a bayesian network that would characterize a small portion of my 1000 features as important and to identify logic gates between the important features. 

I thought about doing this as an alternative to doing regressions, because the dimensionality of the models limits me to testing interactions of two features at a time and prohibits me from finding higher order interactions. 

What I am not sure of is: 

(1) do people currently learn the networks using MCMC or GA or is there something better?

(2) what are the usual criticisms of Bayes Nets?

(3) I think I should test the significance of the bayes net using the likelihood ratio test with the naive bayes as the null hypothesis, but should this be done for different parts of the network or only for the whole thing?

thanks in advance for any feedback.

**thanks for the feedback everyone, especially the backwards moose, esoom! **

I am currently in my last quarter of undergrad at a 2nd-tier UC doing computer science, and am interested in machine learning. I've taken a couple grad-level Machine Learning classes and have been having a lot of fun with my homework and projects. I also have several years' experience working as a software engineer and am currently working (nearly) full-time.

Since I am supporting my fiancee who is also in school right now (and will be for a while), I don't think grad school is an immediate option for me without taking on enormous amounts of debt. Does anyone know of an employer who will consider someone without an advanced degree for a position doing data mining / machine learning? Any tips on getting into the specialty with only a BS in CS?

Ultimately, I would like to be doing work creating/adapting algorithms to solve interesting problems (recommendation engines, advertising optimization, IR, NLP, etc), but wouldn't mind maintaining/enhancing existing systems at first to get my feet wet if needed.

Edit: Thanks for the interesting and insightful comments everyone!

What I'm going to do is find work doing some type of ML ASAP (or at least in proximity to the guys doing it) and then figure out how to afford to get a Master's once I have a little bit more experience applying the stuff.

I'm wondering what an entry level job for an ML career would look like. Embarrassingly, I actually have a Master's in ML, but I know I'm not qualified to tackle the ML jobs listed on Monster.com. I was lucky to survive with a diploma - I can program decently well, but I don't have the intuition behind the math (also, I believe it's hard to fail out of Master's programs in general because they are cash cows for Universities, and hence there is a general reluctance to punish people that are reasonably smart and paying a lot of money). And so I just don't have the confidence to tackle the Amazon/IBM type jobs that I often see. I've done some courses on Coursera (ML with Andrew Ng, which was awesome, and PGM, which is a total beast), and some self-study on statistics, but I would really like an entry level job in ML. However, the search terms ""entry level"" and ""machine learning"" don't really turn up sensible results when I use them. Is there another, easier job title that eventually leads to ML? Or, what else can I be doing to kick start a career in ML?

I apologize if this is a noob/frequently posted query.

Even Professor Andrew Ng from Stanford University (Machine Learning Class) suggests prototyping in Octave and then re-implementing in more general purpose programming languages such as C/C++ or Java for better performance. But how about using let's say Scala programming language for both prototyping and production implementations?

I'm asking this question, because I use Scala myself and I find it to be very good language for both prototyping and production ready systems. Most of the programming assignments for Probabilistic Graphical Models Course given by Professor Daphne Koller, I believe it would be much easier and faster to develop in Scala rather than in Octave, with the goodness of map, flatMap, reduce, prod and sum Scala functions, and an ability to use object oriented programming for data representation instead of putting everything into Octave matrices. (Scala is both object oriented and functional programming language).

I would like to hear some opinions here from someone with an experience in both Scala (or other functional/object oriented programming language) and R/Octave. I'm considering learning R myself or simply prototyping in Octave instead of still using Scala but I'm trying to find a good justification for it.

For this question I'm asking about the pure programming language and not the availability of some stats packages where R rocks.

Hi, so I'm trying to learn how to use Orange with python to do data comparisons, and machine learning to make educated predictions and would be grateful if i could be pointed into the right direction for what I wanted to do. 

So to begin with, i'm trying to compare 2 sets of data, and see if one affects the other. For example, if i had the following data sets:

A = [1,2,3,2,1] 

B = [2,5,8,1,3] 

C = [10,14,16,14,10]

Is there some kind of analysis that could be done, where Orange could figure out that A and C are similar, as they increase and decrease at the same points? I'm hoping to be able to identify that C is closer to A than B in that regard, and then, say if C had another value given, be able to predict what the new value in A was.

I'm currently still following the tutorials found on the Orange site , but, I feel like i still may not know how to approach my problem at the end.
If anyone knows how to go about this, do you think you could point out some functions or classes I should be looking into?

The subspace and and subset techniques, and a small learning rate, seem to make what would seem a recipe for overfitting, due to univariate partitioning, work well(1) and I don't have to normalize data or worry to much about missing features like I do for SVM(2) nor do I have try and divine the optimal C or the best Kernal etc.  I imagine that SVM is better when the number of observations are really small but beyond that I just haven't seen it yet.  

I imagine that there's a whole world of specialized kernels for special problems but for I don't see the point of SVM for typical generic supervised learning problems. 

Flame away.


1) I had thousands of features.  I used the max squares stat used to select the variable at each node to show me which features BRT had deemed important.  Then I took just the top ones (e.g. 20 to 50 of features) and retrained getting almost the same test set ROC.  In fact, most of the time the original kitcken sink model worked better (insignificantly but it was consistent)

2) - Example: One of my features was a standard deviation of the size of some found defect but sometimes, i.e. for some observations, there were no such defects so there was no std. dev.  For BRT I just put in a flag value (e.g. -1) but for SVM I'm not sure what I'd do.

**EDIT**

I guess my ultimate desire from this post is to get a rule of thumb as to when it might be preferable to use SVM (besides really small data sets).  Some of my best friends use SVM but when I ask them why the don't seem to be able to articulate any benefits and yet I know lots of people use them so I assume I must be missing something.",,False,self,t5_2r3gv,True,,,True,t3_r9t7j,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/r9t7j/under_what_conditions_would_it_be_logical_to/,

We’re a couple of machine learning enthusiasts who have been working for a few years on a MATLAB toolbox to help in our research and projects.  We finally put the effort in to make the toolbox more than a hobby (maybe somewhat respectable even), and we’re looking for some feedback…

The toolbox is currently in a free Beta, and we’d appreciate feedback from everyone who is interested in  machine learning with MATLAB.  Like I said, it’s completely free, and available [here](http://www.newfolderconsulting.com/prt).
Just sign up for a free account (we promise to never sell your e-mail address, and we won’t spam you).
You can get a sense for how the toolbox works by checking out [the quick start guide](http://www.newfolderconsulting.com/prtdoc/prtDocQuickStart.html).

We’ve decided that the toolbox will always be free for academic/educational use (we’re still deciding what to do for commercial use).
Although you do need MATLAB (later than 2009A) to use the toolbox, no additional MATLAB toolboxes (e.g., stats, optimization) are required.

Thanks in advance for your time, and if anyone has any questions please e-mail one of us:

* kenny@newFolderConsulting.com
* pete@newFolderConsulting.com

Or post on our [forum](http://www.newfolderconsulting.com/forum).

Thanks again,

-Kenny and Pete

All of the tutorials start with nyquist frequencies and other signal processing talk, treating samples as discrete frequency values. Couldn't find any papers that explain it from a non-DSP perspective.

**What I think I know:**

Most real data is sparse and that compressive sensing randomly samples your input with some (learnt?) bases to compress them to give an error bound that is extremely small.


**What I dont know but want to know:**

* If the bases are learnt, how are they learnt? Matrix factorization? Any very simple explanation on how its learnt? And maybe a link/paper for just understanding the learning process?

* How are the bases that are learnt in compressive sensing different from ones learnt from autoencoders (with sparsity enforced)? How are they different from kmeans centroids?

* If you can, can you explain how it is different in terms of one commonly used machine learning model? (so that it is easy to understand with a comparison)

* Are there any applications apart from reconstructing noisy data, saving bandwidth etc.? 

If you can answer any of these questions at all, or link to appropriate slides/blog entries etc. I'd be greatful. I took a look at some blog entries on Nuit Blanche. Thanks.

I was reading the ""nicest celebrities"" thread on AskReddit, but I figured my story should probably go here instead, considering it's kind of a niche thing.

About a month ago, I was leaving Seattle after an interview (just graduated college in CS) and I decided to grab a beer at the bar.  As I was joking with the bartender, an older gentleman sat down next to me and we started talking.  At some point he mentions to the bartender that he has a PhD in Math and Computer Science, so naturally I'm interested and mention that I'm graduating.  He mentions that his company is involved in statistical programing.

Immediately I ask ""oh, so do you do a lot of work with R?""

Nope.

This guy was none other than Tom Lehman, the director of the SAS Advanced Analytics lab.  Whoops.  Turns out he had been in Seattle on business, and he had been meeting with the board of directors of *Nordstrom*.

After a bit of a talk about life and stuff, he gave me his card and mentioned that if I ended up in machine learning, to give him a call.  Finished his beer and left for his flight.  All around class-act kinda guy.  He also spent a lot of time talking up SAS itself, and left me with a business card.

Just a fun story, I suppose.  I really wish I was more into ML (or fly fishing) so we could've had more to talk about, but all in all, great guy, and although I ended up taking another job, for awhile I seriously considered applying at SAS.

1332318882.0,18,self.MachineLearning,r6i99,Proper method for Calculating Similarity Between Two Similarity Matrices?,thornpyros,20,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/r6i99/proper_method_for_calculating_similarity_between/,"We want to calculate how similar two *similarity* matrices are. First of all I clarify some points. We have two similarity matrices which contain same set of items for which we gather information from two different sources.

You can assume that similarity matrices contain pairwise closeness of two people. These closeness values come from two different sources such as Facebook and MySpace.

Let's give you an example to illustrate what I want to say.

We have 4 people: John, Paul, George, Ringo. All they have Facebook and MySpace accounts.

From their Facebook profiles, we made some processing and somehow we evaluated the closeness of these people as follows.

* Paul - John = 0.5
* Paul - George = 0.4
* Paul - Ringo = 0.6
* John - George = 0.6
* John - Ringo = 0.5
* George - Ringo = 0.6

From MySpace,

* Paul - John = 0.2
* Paul - George = 0.3
* Paul - Ringo = 0.4
* John - George = 0.2
* John - Ringo = 0.1
* George - Ringo = 0.15

From informations above, we can easily create two matrices both of which are symmetric with respect to the main diagonal. Our ultimate goal is to calculate how similar these two matrices are.

1- What if I align all those values (of course only one triangular for each matrix) in one row (like below) and simply evaluate Pearson Correlation Coefficient between
these rows?

* facebook = [0.5, 0.4, 0.6, 0.6, 0.5, 0.6]
* myspace  = [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.15]

You may have noticed that these similarities are **not independent** of each other. So, is it enough or appropriate method to calculate similarity between two matrices?
According to an article named Mandel Test on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantel_test) this simple procedure is not appropriate.

&gt;Because distances are not independent of each other – since changing the ""position"" of one object would change n − 1 of these distances (the distance from that object to each of the others) – we can't assess the relationship between the two matrices by simply evaluating the correlation coefficient between the two sets of distances and testing its statistical significance. The Mantel test deals with this problem.

2- How about the rank correlation techniques such as Kendall?

3- Is there more specific or proper technique to evaluate this? 

4- Mantel Test calculates correlation between two matrices. It seems it is proper for our purpose. I will read [Spatial Analysis in Ecology - Mantel's Test](http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/scicomp/Dloads/SpatialAnalysisEcologists/SpatialEcologyMantelTest.pdf) which can be reached by Wikipedia but could anyone who use this method for same reason share his/her experience?",,False,self,t5_2r3gv,True,,,True,t3_r6i99,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/r6i99/proper_method_for_calculating_similarity_between/,

More detail: I'm particularly struggling with harmonic signals that have close frequencies. As input I have two signals with very little noise that are far apart (w1 and w2 frequencies).

Edit: Here is my [output](http://i.imgur.com/vHwrVU8h.png) which suggests two very close frequencies at either 0.2 and 0.8 hertz/sample is more likely than two signals at 0.2 and 0.8 hertz/sample respectively.

Hi r/machineLearning!


So, after having dabbled here and there in machine learning for some time now, I think I now know what I am truly interested in. It took me some time to figure it out, but I needed to survey the landscape first. 


I want to really dive into _un_supervised learning. This has a two fold advantage for me, one, I am very interested in the subject, and two, I believe I will be able to use it in my line of work which is very signal-processing intensive. 


So, quite simply, I wanted to ask any of you, and those more experienced than me, for an ""executive summary"" or list, of unsupervised learning algorithms. 


(If you like, feel free to add a brief run down of your thoughts for each one on the list. What are their strengths? What might be some disadvantages? Pitfalls? Can you sprinkle some intuition on each one?)


From the list, I am fairly certain that I will be able to do enough focused research and learn them all very well eventually. I just need a starting point list. 


(I have already taken Andrew Ngs class on coursera). 


So far my list includes: 

1) K-Means

2) ICA


Thanks in advance!!

Some thoughts/links/info...

The [1000 genome project](http://aws.amazon.com/1000genomes/) has already released data for 1700 genomes, weighing in at 200TB. We know the 3 billion base pairs of a human can be represented directly (uncompressed) in 750MB. 750MB * 1700 sequences = 1.275 TB. One suggestion I've encountered is that this is raw sequencing output that needs splicing together, if you do that and are happy with that one interpretation for each genome we're perhaps looking at 1.275TB instead of 200 - a good start at making this data more manageable.

1.275TB will fit on a single HD. Furthermore it's not unreasonable to conceive of a single PC box with say 2TB of RAM. However...

Google already perform deep learning on large data sets, see [Scaling Deep Learning, Jeff Dean, Google](http://techtalks.tv/talks/57639/) and [Peter Norvig: Channeling the Flood of Data](http://fora.tv/2012/10/14/Peter_Norvig_Channeling_the_Flood_of_Data). tl;dr - they partition the data between machines within a data centre and communicate connection weight deltas between machines.

It seems to me that deep learning may be able to discover deeper structures in the genetic sequences than are currently known, and that we might be able to find correlations between these deep structures and phenotype level features.

I've [asked](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/w1du3/is_there_a_search_engine_over_artificial/) about a month ago, if there is a search engine to search over a Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning -related sites. Unfortunately, the best answer I'd been given was to use Google's advanced search operators like 'inurl'.

I was able to find a better solution by using the Google Custom Search technology. I made a custom search engine with *.edu, *.ac.uk, *.edu.au and so on sites and domain zones, 145 in a total at this moment.
From my point of view that search engine gives much better result pages, than an ordinary search. Also, the search index is almost spam-free and paid content -free.

There is a feature, that allows one to inspect what sites are included in the index, to comment them and to vote for or against them (to purge unrelevant site from the index, for example). Also, everyone is welcome to suggest new sites using a special form on the site.
In short, it has all very basic machinery needed to make such scoped search engine to be community driven.

Try it at [http://neatserpent.com/](http://neatserpent.com/)

Give me your feedback, please.
Do you find it helpful and better than ordinary search engine?
Would you use it?

1320437226.0,19,self.MachineLearning,m0od7,looking for ML aficionado in London for great chats and maybe a startup,MLstartupLondon,23,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/m0od7/looking_for_ml_aficionado_in_london_for_great/,"TL;DR? Here's the gist:

Me: 3 startups under my belt. Started as a programmer, then trainer, then entrepreneur, now CTO &amp; Board member for a leading customer insight company part of large bank. Large system and infrastructure specialist. Extensive &amp; practical experience in raising funds and successfully managing both startup and established businesses. Fascinated by the power of data. Can't imagine myself spending the rest of my life being a cog in the machine.

You: Machine learning specialist, programmer, analyst, understands how to navigate and crunch large datasets, from BI to predictive analytics. Interested in implementing applications from fraud detection to margin improvements through better clustering regardless of industry. Fascinated by the power of data. Can't imagine himself spending the rest of his or her life being a cog in the machine.


The startup:

The core idea it to build platforms and systems around the progressively larger datasets held by various sized companies, helping them solve big issues - cost reduction, profitability and reducing risk. I’m an infrastructure and software specialist and have access to 1) systems, 2) datasets 3) extensive practical in certain industry segments, namely web-scale companies and tier 1 retailers.

This project is in the very early planning stages. I'm looking forward to discuss the form it could take with like-minded individuals but with complementary skills sets, namely: predictive analytics &amp; AI as it applies to machine learning on large datasets. 

Want more specifics ideas? I have plenty of these, but I’m sure you do to, so let’s meet face to face and discuss them.

Ultimately the goal is to crystallize on a specific concept, develop together a minimum viable product and get the company bootstrapped or angel-funded (something I also have plenty of experience with), all via a lean startup model.


My philosophy on startups:

Startups built in one’s free time often fail because they drag on, ending up as little more than side projects you can’t quite get rid of (due to co-founder guilt, or perhaps the little money they bring in every month). 

The core idea for this project is based on lean, that is, to launch a minimum viable product as early as possible. Getting feedback. Measuring results (important!). Pivot if it’s not working. This helps tremendously in staying motivated, limits the dreaded paralyzing fear of failure, and more importantly, keep the time from inception to first client/funding to a minimum.

My intuition tells me that it also has more representational power, if just by a constant factor. It definitely has the downside of being harder to implement quickly on a computer (matrix multiplication won't work as nicely) but if it has greater representational power per neuron than a network with discrete layers, perhaps it is worth some research.

**Edit**: I am mainly asking about feedforward nets in which there is no restriction on connectivity, aside from having no cycles (that is required for it to be considered a feedforward net).

1333999222.0,16,self.MachineLearning,s18je,Extracting Structure on a Very Complexly Interacting Feature Space,CPlusPlusDeveloper,18,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/s18je/extracting_structure_on_a_very_complexly/,"Consider the case where you have a dataset with fairly low dimensionality and a very high number of data points. One such that in most supervised learning approaches you'd be more concerned with minimizing bias rather than variance.

However in this problem the relatively low dimensionality is somewhat deceptive because the variables have very complex high dimensional interactions. I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about:

Suppose you were looking at randomly sampled points in chess games between evenly matches players. The data you had was which pieces each player had lost and you wanted to predict whether the game would ultimately end up in win/lose/draw.

Your feature space in this case is 30 0/1 variables: 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 1 queen, (no king because if he's missing the game's over) multiplied by 2 sides. Assume that you have access to hundreds of millions of independent data points (you can always run AI-AI games and sample new positions).

The idiosyncrasies of the interactions here runs far deeper than standard linear/quadratic variable interactions, for example:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Early game when a lot of material's on the board knights tend to be better than bishops. When there's not much material bishops tend to be better.

* If a player is missing a few pawns from ranks far away from each other that's not as bad as a cluster of pawns missing which opens up a hole in his defense.

* At the end of the game if the other side has two bishops, but the difference between having one bishop and no bishop is the difference between a guaranteed draw and win.

* A queen is about equal to two rooks early game, but becomes much less powerful late game.

* The difference of one side having 1 pawn and the other side having no pawns is far more than the difference between having 7 pawns and 8 pawns (because of the chance to convert the pawn to another piece).

As you can see there are endless variations of how the variables can interact. Many of the interactions go along an early/late game dimension. I.e. fewer material more material interactions, which basically involve some derived metric from the underlying 30 variables (more pieces that are captured off the board the ""later game"" it is, so a rough approximation might just be a sum of the 30 0/1 variables).

This makes it very challenging because it's almost like you need a combined supervised-unsupervised learning process that can discover interesting projections of the variables to interact on (i.e. discover the early/late game metric and start interacting other variables on it). Then plug those into a supervised method. This brings me to the various approaches that I'm considering:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Boosted trees: The problem is the underlying weak learners don't have any chance to capture any of the interesting structure in the feature space. For trees to work they need to have many nodes to discover the complex interactions, and boosting tends not to do well with deep trees.

* Random forests: This has a better chance of working. But I would have to use very deep trees to capture the interaction, and even though random forest does pretty well with deep trees I've never heard of trees 20+ levels deep which is what you would need to discover some of the early/late game interactions. (At least you would need to go 20+ deep if you were splitting nodes based on single variables).

* SVMs: This seems somewhat appealing. I'm not too experienced with SVMs, have much more experience with trees. But from what I understand they have a good reputation from capturing non-parametric interactions like these. My only concern here is that a Gaussian kernel wouldn't work here. But again I'm inexperienced so any input on this in particular would be greatly appreciated.

* Logistic regression: This one I have to throw out right away because the problem is so non-linear, and I would have to include 32! interactions (an interaction for every possible piece).

* Neural nets: I'm always somewhat skeptical of these, but the universal function feature does seem to be what I'm looking for here. It would have to be high layer though, and even though the data set's large, with ANNs over fitting is always a problem IMO. Maybe bagging many-layered ANNs here might be a good approach, but I've never heard of anyone doing this so I'm not sure if there are good arguments not to.

* Manifold learning: This is the most ""far out"" approach, but it seems like the only thing that has the direct capability of recovering what I want, i.e. low-material high-material variable projection. Of course I don't know how exactly to translate an unsupervised method into a supervised problem...

Anyway this problem has me tied up in knots. So any interesting approaches or good advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

I have 30 observations in 2 classes (15 in each). Each observation has several thousand variables (this could be reduced in a somewhat hand-wavy way, but I'd rather not). All variables are continuous; some are normally distributed and some aren't; some are most likely redundant; some are highly informative and others aren't/ are misinformative. I'm using SVM with the RBF kernel (from libSVM in Matlab) to build classifiers, using leave-one-out cross validation (or leave-pair-out, removing one from each class, for tests with fewer iterations) to test the feature selection algorithm, but I'm having real trouble finding a feature selection algorithm which is at all stable across the different iterations of the LOOCV. 

At first I tried ranking features in terms of their contrast-to-noise ratio and building a classifier by using the top one, then the top two, then the top n, and finding the optimal classifier out of those, but it meant that a lot of redundant information was included (possibly weighting the classifier in an unhelpful manner), and the results were poor, as well as the choice of features being very unstable- I think because small variations in CNR cause quite large changes in CNR rank. Then I tried greedy forward selection, which was better (80% sensitivity, 87% specificity), but still each classifier was picking up different features (although some were picked more frequently than others). The greedy algorithm used LOOCV within the remaining 29 variables to choose which feature should be added, so it was a sort of (LOO^2). It would be interesting to use the probability of any feature being selected to weight the final classifier, but to test this I'd need to go to a third level of LOO, which is getting absurd.

At the moment I'm trying to reduce the number of features by combining covarying variables, using PCA. However, it's my understanding that PCA doesn't really work very well with such rectangular data, and so I'd need to heuristically reduce the number of features first for it to effective. In particular, I found that the contrast:noise ratio of each PCC-transformed variable had no correlation with the latent of the PCC (even when the latent was 0). This means that PCA doesn't actually reduce the search space at all. *Edit: Also, none of the features actually seem to have a very high covariance.*

Have I missed some handy redundancy reduction, dimensionality reduction or other feature selection algorithm which is useful for this sort of data? Or is it crazy to be even looking at this rectangular a data set, and I should be trying to massively cut down the number of variables that I'm feeding in to any algorithm?

EDIT: Thanks for the help, guys! In the unlikely event that I can squeeze a publication out of this in the next couple of months I'll do my best to big up /r/machinelearning.

I just found this place and probably will lurk around more from now on. Some great threads here!.

Maybe I will just go straight to the question:

Can someone explain to me the idea behind ""graph kernels"" in some simple terms? I haven't been able to find any educational material on it, just read some papers. It looked like they are reconstructing the graph into various parts (like walks, paths, etc) and then comparing those parts to get the distances between graphs. Is it the whole idea or did I miss it?

So for example: would simply taking all minimum spanning trees of some weighted graphs and then comparing the sets of those trees be a kernel? Or does it have to be something more (like satisfy triangle inequalities or something else).

Current I'm doing a lot of web development with Ruby on Rails, but I'd like to break into machine learning. I have a strong feeling that mastering (not just doing the exercises, but practicing them regularly) the algorithms that Andrew Ng has shown in the course might be enough that I may end up with one or two opportunities to use these skills while doing my job, say for example classifying users based on site activity or being able to predict the amount of traffic on any given day.. 

However, I'm being lured into a lot more other challenging courses, like coursera's NLP course. I don't want to end up a jack-of-all-trades with little chance of actually applying what I've learned to my daily job, so I feel focusing on a small number of algorithms to master would be better than getting a general understanding of many algorithms.

My current gig involves some machine-learning, and a lot of the experiments I want to run take up to a day to complete. My previous programming work has been in domains where the edit/compile/test cycle has been much faster, and it's no problem to restart the program every few minutes if need be. I'm struggling with this: often bugs only become apparent several hours into the run, while I'm asleep or otherwise engaged, so it's easy to lose days to trivial mistakes. Some of the people here must deal with this all the time: what tools and strategies do you use to handle it?

Some things seem obvious:

 * Make the code faster, by parallelising it, distributing it to a cluster, running it on GPUs, running it on faster hardware, or just old-fashioned profiling and hotspot elimination. I've done some of this, and intend to do more - the 1-day runtime quoted above is after parallelisation.
 * Unit testing and static checks. I've been pretty lax about this, but I'm now starting to bring my code under test so I can have some confidence my changes will work before I kick off a full run.
 * Making my code self-monitoring: watching for anomalous situations and logging warnings then handling them, or aborting rather than continuing in an inconsistent state.
I learned this one in a nasty way: an external tool that I invoked as part of my fitness function was failing when given certain combinations of arguments. This meant that there was no ""total energy"" line in its output, so the simulated energy use for that test was zero; my GA proceeded to optimise until the bug was *always* triggered :-(
 * Periodically checkpoint the program's state, so you can restore from the last good state before a bug is triggered or the machine goes down.
 * Output log data in a machine-readable fashion, so you can copy-and-paste that line to get a ready-made testcase when something goes wrong.

... but I'm sure there's more to it than that.

I also have some more focussed questions:

 * People have suggested that I try watcher daemons or cron jobs to periodically restart my code if it hangs or dies. That makes sense for something like a web server, but I don't understand how it would help for a single long-running calculation. Do you do this? Does it help?
 * How do you handle the situation where your program is sitting there using up 100% CPU but producing no output?
 * How much logging do you do? How do you decide what to log?

Magic the Gathering is a very broad game and a new set of cards is released every year so the cards people are playing with are always changing. There are some big competitions and money to be earned in it if you're good.

Magic got a pretty solid [rules](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/rules) so implementing the rules in code shouldn't be that much of a hassle (taking Hofstadter's law into account...) but hammering all the cards in would take some time.

My question now is, what method would you use to train an AI player? I was thinking about using monte carlo but then it occurred to me that I can't let the deck of cards be in a predefined state because then I would be allowing the player to ""see"" the future when he's drawing the cards. Some cards however allow the player to change the order of e.g. the top three cards of his deck so I can't let the player choose a random card from it.

Training a neural network for each possible deck seems out of hand because of the immense range of cards out there.

Would it also be possible to let two AI players play against each other to find the best possible deck?

This is merely just a speculation for me at the moment, my assumptions might be naive.

I'm curious about approaches taken to this problem and the technical, statistical and philosophical underpinnings of it.

For example, if my sets are identical and both contain one banana, I could say they are 100% alike. But if one has a banana and apple, the other a banana and pear, how can I measure this?

As a starting point, I could give 1 point for a match and divide by the average length of the sets. In this case, my sets have 0.5 similarity, while the two bananas score 1. But I can see there are problematic implications here - sets with four matching items and length nine have a lower score but more matches. I'm not sure if this is what I want or not. Similarly, I can see there are consequences to deducting points when items don't match.

I'm asking such a broad question seeking general overviews of approaches and options. Are there any good articles about similarity which you could recommend? I'd also be interested to see some examples of different similarity measures used in different applications and discussion of why they were chosen.

tl;dr there's a lot to the concept of similarity - can you suggest some overviews?

Currently  I am using SciKit Learn to classify text documents.  I badly need to lower the dimensionality of my data, and I have began doing so by attempting to implement some feature selection classes.  The only problem is that they're not working very well.

I found this [streamhacker post](http://streamhacker.com/2010/06/16/text-classification-sentiment-analysis-eliminate-low-information-features/), but I am less familiar with the NLTK, so I was hoping to learn of other feature selection options (i.e., low information feature elimination) before I started.

I know next to nothing about Machine Learning, have a beginner-level (and growing) understanding of a variety of programming languages (mostly Ruby) and the highest level of math I've taken is Calculus I. No formal statistics. I read lesswrong.com and attempt to grok rationality and Bayes (no promises). 

From searching around ""noob"" threads on /r/MachineLearning I came across the O'Reilly [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://nltk.org/book/) book and was considering starting there. 

The reason I am posting this here: As I said, I have no formal statistics training/education and the highest math I've completed is Calculus I. Math and statistics are intriguing to me but I haven't had time to pursue further. Is it not worth getting into Machine Learning with the level of math education I currently have? I am not opposed to learning more (I'd like to), but if that's a necessity from day one or shortly thereafter I might be better off waiting and pursuing this again in the future. 

My interest is hobby-level at the moment, possibly developing into web-app applications down the line and of course with the ultimate goal of helping to save the planet and/or take over the world eventually.

Your advice appreciated! Be as honest as you want - you won't be crushing my dreams or anything. As I said: hobby-level interest at the moment.

I'm experimenting with performing a sentiment analysis (positive/negative classification) on review text for a commercial application.

As a training set I have ~200k labeled reviews from a popular domain specific website. I intend to experiment with training a classifier at the sentence and at the paragraph (or complete review) level.

The data to be classified is ~300k labeled reviews from the same domain. Due to legal reasons I am not able to train my classifier(s) with this data.

The approaches I am considering for constructing the feature vectors include: uni/bigrams, parts of speech filtered uni/bigrams, and parts of speech tagged uni/bigrams.


Anyways, to my questions:

Is it even feasible to train a model with a feature vector so large? Imagine each review is only 100 words, then the feature space of my training set is as high as 20 million dimensions.

If my feature vectors are all essentially bags of words, how can I use a model trained on the words in my training set to classify the words in my test set? That is to say, will there not be an issue with finding overlap between the vocabulary in the review to be classified and the group of reviews used to train the model?

The application is to decide what ad to show people when they visit a web page.  Our goal is to show people the ad they are most likely to click on, but for new ads we won't have much data, so initially there will be greater uncertainty as to what their click through rate will be.

A very simple version of this, which only looks at the number of impressions and clicks on each ad, is to use a beta distribution, this technique is described [here](http://blog.locut.us/2011/09/22/proportionate-ab-testing/) (it's also known as Thompson sampling, and it's a solution to the multi-armed bandit problem).

But I'd like to use a machine learning algorithm that uses a much wider range of attributes than simply the number of impressions and clicks on each ad.  Ideally the input attributes can be both categorical (where there could be thousands of possible values for each attribute, for example ""city/state/country""), and numeric (like time of day).

I also have some research experience applying machine learning to computer vision/object recognition for robotics.  At this point I would say I have an ""OK"" general understanding of various ML concepts:  classifiers, clustering, association rules, ANNs, etc.  However, I don't really have a deep understanding of the math behind these things, as my undergrad courses mostly glossed over those details.

I have been accepted into a MS CS program at a highly ranked university (top-5 in AI).  It will take me an additional 3 semesters of school to get the Masters vs. leaving with just a BS.  I am trying to decide if I need to continue with the MS degree.  I really like learning, and would LIKE to do the degree, but the opportunity cost is weighing on the decision.

My career goal is to become more than a general software engineer.  I like ML and related (vision, robotics, NLP, etc), and it seems like it's both interesting and practical to industry.  Ideally I would have a job where I keep up with the state-of-the-art and apply it to the needs of the organization.  Another great job would be doing applied (or basic) research.  I'm more interested in solving technically hard problems that say going to Scrum meetings, talking about unit tests and deployments, etc.  I'm not saying those aren't necessary, but if that's ALL I do at work I could not stand it.  I should also mention that I have substantial ""general"" software engineering experience and I like coding.  I chose to go back to school to do something more interesting.  The question now is whether to continue to the Masters or stop with a Bachelors.  PhD is not realistic for me in my situation.

I would love to hear from people who work with ML, AI, etc in industry, including level of education required.  Thanks!

First, I'm not sure if this subreddit accepts questions like this. Please redirect me if it's better posted elsewhere.

The presenting problem I have is that running k-means clustering on my data set results in almost everything being put in one cluster. I've tried varying the number of clusters but it keeps happening. I'd like to understand why this is happening and what my options are for getting a more even, or more informative, distribution between clusters.

Some background: I've gathered a list of friends and their likes from Facebook, making a sparse matrix like this:

    data = {
        'friend1': ['like1', 'like2', 'like3'],
        'friend2': ['like4'],
        'friend3': ['like1', 'like4'],
    }

There's about 100 friends with about 1 to 300 likes each. I make k centroids, giving each a random set of likes, and count the shared likes for my distance function (dist = 1 - total_shared_likes / 1000).

Each iteration I calculate the distance between a friend and each centroid and assign them to the nearest. Almost all end up in the same centroid. To move the centroids to the average position of their members, I total all the user and centroid likes, then divide by the number of users + 1 (for the centroid's likes). Each users' likes count for 1, but the centroid likes are floats. 

Any thoughts on why this is happening? Am I missing something or doing something wrong? Or is this data set not amenable to k-means, should I try a different algorithm?

Thanks!

**edit** Still getting all friends in the same cluster despite

*(i)* creating a euclidian distance function

    def distance(self, other):
        dist = 0.0
        for i, l in enumerate(self.likes):
            if l != other.likes[i]:
                dist += 1
        
        return math.sqrt(diet)

The likes variables hold tuples where each item is 1 or 0 (like or dislike), and all users' tuples are the same length (equal to the number of all possible items to like). I'm adding 1 if they're different as this is the only possible distance (and it's 1 squared, of course).

*(ii)*

On initialisation, assigning a random friends' likes to the first centroid, then for each other centroid (up to *k*) assigning the likes of the friend furthest from all previous centroids.

*(iii)*

On each iteration, if a centroid has no members, it's assigned the likes of the friend furthest from all centroids.

*(iv)*

No longer including the centroid's likes when calculating the average position between its members.

I've put my code on paste bin as I might have overlooked something - http://pastebin.com/ZFvFfFe3

Here's some example output:

    --- iteration 4
    {'cluster 0': {'dist': 1256.4364795929926, 'members': 174},
     'cluster 1': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0},
     'cluster 2': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0},
     'cluster 3': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0},
     'cluster 4': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0}}
    --- iteration 5
    {'cluster 0': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0},
     'cluster 1': {'dist': 1256.4364795929926, 'members': 174},
     'cluster 2': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0},
     'cluster 3': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0},
     'cluster 4': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0}}

Thanks for all of your input, I'm very grateful. Please keep posting feedback, I'm set on solving this! 

**edit 2**

Fixed the distance function

    def distance(self, other):
        total_dist = 0.0
        for i, l in enumerate(self.likes):
            if l != other.likes[i]:
                total_dist += (l - other.likes[i])**2

        return math.sqrt(total_dist / len(self.likes))

For example, i wanted to read up a bit more on Naive Bayes classifiers for Document Classification and went to the wikipedia page. I just looked at this section: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#The_naive_Bayes_probabilistic_model and i have no real idea what its trying to tell me. 

Another example is the Andrew Ng lectures. I was following fine right until he got to this blackboard, then he kinda lost me: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u4G23_OohI&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=1131s 

I originally learned some of this stuff 10 - 12 years ago and have barely used it since, so I could do with some recommendations on what I need to learn (or re-learn as the case may be).

I've looked at the Khan academy site and it seems really good, but I don't even know where to start with it. Do i need statistics / probability / algebra or linear algebra? If its linear algebra (which was mentioned by Andrew Ng in the lecture video) do I need to watch all 143 videos on it or are there specific parts which would be useful?

While preparing for a talk I will give soon,  I recently started digging into two major (Free) tools for interactive data visualization: [GGobi][1] and [mondrian][2] - both offer a great range of capabilities (even if they're a bit buggy).

I wish to ask for your help in articulating (both to myself, and for my future audience) **When is it helpful to use interactive plots? Either for data exploration (for ourselves) and data presentation (for a ""client"")?**

For when explaining the data to a client, I can see the value of animation for:

- Using ""identify/linking/brushing"" for seeing which data point in the graph is what.
- Presenting a sensitivity analysis of the data (e.g: ""if we remove this point, here is what we will get)
- Showing the effect of different groups in the data (e.g: ""let's look at our graphs for males and now for the females"")
- Showing the effect of time (or age, or in general, offering another dimension to the presentation)

For when exploring the data ourselves, I can see the value of identify/linking/brushing when exploring an outlier in a dataset we are working on.

But other then these two examples, I am not sure what other practical use these techniques offer.  Especially for our own data exploration!

It could be argued that the interactive part is good for exploring (For example) a different behavior of different groups/clusters in the data.  But when (in practice) I approached such situation, what I tended to do was to run the relevant statistical procedures (and post-hoc tests) - and what I found to be significant I would then plot with colors clearly dividing the data to the relevant groups.  From what I've seen, this is a safer approach then ""wondering around"" the data (which could easily lead to data dredging (were the scope of the multiple comparison needed for correction is not even clear).

I'd be very happy to read your experience/thoughts on this matter.

(this question can be a wiki - although it is not subjective and a well thought-out answer will gladly win my ""answer"" mark :) )

But this subreddit has grown since then, and I'd like the see if there is any sort of consensus.

Context: I'm a 2nd year PhD student in ML. In my first year, I decided that academia isn't for me, and that I'd like to go into industry after my PhD. Recently, I've seen that if one's intentions are to go into industry, then the MS is the superior degree. But I have also seen that a lot of machine learning jobs require PhDs.

To be honest, I'm leaning towards bailing with a masters, because I can always come back for the PhD if I dislike my options in industry. Before I bring this up with my advisor, though, I'd like to know what sort of jobs I can expect to get. If it changes anything, I have two bachelors degrees (applied math and physics) that aren't in CS.

&gt; A computer scientist working in the machine learning area joined a large money management
company some years ago and set up a group to do portfolio management using stock predictions given by large neural nets. When we visited, I asked how he explained the neural nets to clients. “Simple,” he said; “We fit binary trees to the inputs and outputs of the neural nets and show the trees to the clients. Keeps them happy!” In both stock prediction and credit rating, the priority is accuracy. Interpretability is a secondary goal that can be finessed.

I want to make sure I understand what this computer scientist at the large money mgmt company is doing.  He's taking the predicted outputs of the neural net - the yhats - and using them as the dependent variable for a single binary tree model.  Is that right?  I understand that this is solely for client interpretability, and the tree wouldn't be used for prediction, but it still feels a little funny.  The tree wouldn't fit the neural net's predictions perfectly, so you'd have situations like this:

you: ""well the tree predicts this, but that's actually not our prediction, because our real model is a neural net.""  

client: ""why does the net make a different prediction?""

you: ""it's a black box, I can't say""  

and you're back to square one.

Traditional classification techniques assume a fixed-sized feature vector. Is there a way to overcome this?

I'm a compsci academic. I have a problem for which I'm attempting to train a binary classifier, with some degree of success. The classifers I've tried are ID3, MaxEnt, and NaiveBayes (the versions built in to NLTK). I have a suspicion that to achieve great performance with my features requires a classifier that doesn't follow the independence assumption - that is, one that can weight feature values dependent on the values assigned to other features.

ID3 intuitively doesn't follow this assumption, and naive Bayes does (that's its naivety). I'mm not sure about MaxEnt. In any case, my error reduction rate is 43% with MaxEnt, 12% with NBayes and 38% with ID3.

Can anyone recommend a classifier that is good with handling noise, doesn't follow the independence assumption, and can accept nominal features without too much coaxing?

May work well with nonconvex optimization.,dhammack,15,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1he0ig/an_idea_i_have_for_improving_ensemble_and_neural/,"This is an idea I had today, I figured I'd post it here. If it's been done before or wouldn't work, let me know.

The TL;DR is to add a term to the cost function of a model to prevent ensembles from learning the same representation of the data. I've thought about this for ensemble models and for neural networks (connected ensembles), and I think it could work for both.

If the ensembled models are parameterized by some vector theta, then we can tell how similar two models are by using a similarity measure on their parameter vectors. RBF, cosine, squared difference, whatever. Then what we do is penalize the model for having a larger similarity measure with the other models by introducing a new term to the cost function. For each model, this could be some constant times the sum of similarity measures with all the other models. If we don't want the O( n^2 ) complexity, maybe we sample the other models at random, or choose a few at the beginning such that through multiple time steps each model can affect the others. 

This would also work for neural nets, where we use the similarity penalty to prevent feature detectors from learning the same features. The reason I mentioned nonconvex optimization is because forcing the models to find different local minima could make for a better exploration of the feature space. 

Has this been investigated before? If not, I suppose I could put a test together to see how it impacts model performance, and whether the cost in training efficiency is worth it.",,False,self,t5_2r3gv,False,,,True,t3_1he0ig,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1he0ig/an_idea_i_have_for_improving_ensemble_and_neural/,

Unfortunately, I currently only have a very small pool or training data - 162 sets of feature vectors with corresponding scores out of 100 (I have to manually label this lol! Working on creating more data though obviously). So I take this limited training set, and here's a snapshot of how well my network adapts to it:

At first I'm like, ""wow this is sick!"" The results are much, much better than when I originally tried gradient descent on its own. Like, this is too good to be true. Hmm, maybe it is. So I decide to try something - use the same test/target values, but create 162 completely *random* feature vectors. 

Uh oh - my network was able to fit the random training data *even better* than my actual training data! In fact, it fit the random data perfectly. Shit:

Output value:0.92 | Test value:0.92

Output value:0.2 | Test value:0.2

Output value:0.2 | Test value:0.2

Output value:0.2 | Test value:0.2

Output value:0.2 | Test value:0.2

Output value:0.62 | Test value:0.62

Output value:0.7 | Test value:0.7

Output value:0.77 | Test value:0.77

Now I'm thinking one of two possibilities:

1) Because I have so few training samples (only 162), my 3-layer network of 43-&gt;25-&gt;1 is able to over-fit the data with all its weights. 

2) My original feature vectors are absolutely worthless, and just as good as inputting plain garbage. These feature vectors I hand-coded based on what I researched would be appropriate to my problem domain. 

What do you guys think is going on, and will I only know once I have more training data? Given the topology of my network, any idea how much data I'll actually need? 

Cheers.

I have an implementation done, but I'm not sure it's working correctly.

I'll describe what I've done and hopefully somone can point out if I've made any mistakes.

* The BM machine model is a set of binary units in which each unit is connected to every other unit via a weighted connection.

* First, we train the machine on a training set of examples to determine the weights of the connections.

* This learning phase can be divided into two parts - one is the empirical correlation between the units of the examples in the training set and one is the correlation between these units according to some probability model.

* At the end of learning, the probability correlation is subtracted from the empirical correlation and the resulting correlation is the weights for our BM.

* We can then set our neurons to an input and run the activation model on them to recieve an output.

I realise as I type this that my understanding of the topic is really very fuzzy. Here's a few questions : 

Having trained the machine on a set of examples, what should be the output when providing it with one of those examples as input? Will you always recieve that example back or will you occasionally get one of the other examples or even nonsense patterns?

I've found several RBM implementations online. How does a Restricted Boltzmann Machine differ from one with no hidden units? I'd like to be able to edit a RBM into what I've described so that I can make sure my implementation works the way it should.

I know there's lots of resources about what to learn, and they are really great.  If anything I have an embarrassment of riches and I am looking to prioritize.  The background is that I got accepted into a graduate certificate program in Data Mining that covers a lot of Machine Learning topics, and I am trying to make sure my math is up to speed.  I've got about a month before classes start and I'm trying to spend it on building math skills.  So I never had Linear Algebra so I am focusing on that and I am also planning to get in an overview of Probability Theory.  If I have extra time over the holidays (ha), I'm going to work on the rest of Statistics.  Is this the priority you guys would follow?  Is there another subject that I absolutely need to digest to hit the ground running?  I am obviously planning to continue to work to back fill my math as I get time, but looking to plan this initial flurry of activity

1300025390.0,12,self.MachineLearning,g33pi,An idea for a platform where people can play the Turing game and chat bot developers can gather data and compete.,quiteamess,17,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/g33pi/an_idea_for_a_platform_where_people_can_play_the/,"While discussing with nadie854 on his [reserbot](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/f3uvz/a_chatterbot_built_using_a_neural_networks/) I had an idea for a platform where people can play the Turing game and people can submit bots that participate in the Turing game. The key Idea is that data is gathered by the conversations. This data can be used to train bots. Another strength is that the chatter bots stand in competition and can be tested.

The data-gathering idea is already there in [cleverbot](http://cleverbot.com/). But there is a key difference in this approach. In the original [Turing game](http://cogprints.org/499/1/turing.html) there is a human interrogator C, a Human A and a bot B. The interrogator tries to find out if A or B is the bot. Therefore, there are conversations between C and B, i.e. humans that can be used as training data. Imagine this on a large scale where many people play this game, as in google image labeler. This would bring a lot of good data with conversations that aim at the identification of chatbots. This data can then be used to further train chatbots. 

Further the idea is not to train a single bot, but to provide a platform for chatbot developers. The bots can stand in competition, as it is already established in the research community (for example the [Loebner prize](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.loebner.net%2FPrizef%2Floebner-prize.html&amp;rct=j&amp;q=turing%20test%20competition&amp;ei=ZMd8TY6uLsbGswaNxsHbBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNmtOxBD5jb1UYDbd4Mp53MOKWyA&amp;cad=rja)). The incentive for developers to use this platform would be the possibility to gather data.

I think this idea has quite a potential, if advertised in the AI-community. It is appealing to the general public as a game and appealing for developers as data-source and competition. As I won't have the time to implement this idea I wanted to share it here.
