Do SDD drives fail as often as traditional drives? Find out all this and more (many graphs inside).,LinuxFreeOrDie,1455,235,279,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/l8id4/did_digg_make_us_the_dumb_how_have_reddit/,"Hello TheoryOfReddit! I have gathered data on reddit and reddit's comments for well over a year, and also gathered historical data to compare various metrics, such as grade level, length, swear words, etc. I compared how the comments are now to how they were when reddit started, or how /r/pics measures up to /r/truereddit. I tabulated and compared millions of comments, and here are the results.

I'll answer my last question first: SSD drives catastrophic failure rate is about the same as traditional hard drives, despite not having any moving parts. This might seem irrelevant to you, but it's probably the most relevant statistic of them all since I had all my data on my SSD drive and it spontaneously died. Of course I wasn't backing anything up. Long story short this was about six months ago so you should keep in mind all my charts stop there. The subreddit data is even older, about a year ago, since I hadn't dumped it into a chart in a while. I had thought about rebuilding all the data, but in the end it was too much work, especially since I'm just not as in to reddit as I was, so my interest has moved on to other projects. What this basically means is I never ended up doing a lot of the comparisons I had planned, and unfortunately can't perform any addition queries if you are curious about anything I didn't cover. So without further adieu: the results.

We'll start with the centerpiece of the show, the reading level that the comments are written at. As you might have expected, the reading level of reddit comments as dropped about [a full grade level since it's inception.](http://i.imgur.com/dYAUe.png) Flesch-Kincaid and Coleman-Liau are just two different ways of measuring grade level. The blue line is Flesch-Kincaid for the /r/reddit.com subreddit *only*. I wanted to make sure the inclusion of some of the joke subreddits like circlejerk wasn't bringing down the score for all of reddit later on, which as you can see it wasn't. I marked Digg v4 on the graph so we might see if there was a dramatic drop off in quality after we were flooded with Digg refugees, and as you can see, it's pretty apparent that there was not. I should also mention that that line roughly corresponds to the division between the data I got from crawling the homepage every day, compared to digging through old pages. Every data point after that line is based on around 500k comments, whereas the data points before it are based on anywhere from 50k to only 39 comments (3rd data point with the big drop), though usually around 10k. That's why you see some big spikes, particularly early on. You can see the exact numbers on the Google Docs sheet at the end.

Next we'll move on to comment *length*. A big complaint is that we have replaced substantive comments with quick one liners and puns, and comment length is a good way to see if people are *discussing* or just trying to make a quick joke or assert an opinion without backing it up. As you can see, comments are on average [around 2-3 times shorter than they used to be.](http://i.imgur.com/C8Dr2.png) Once again, Digg had little, if any, effect. Reddit's rise in popularity took place well before Digg, and the jump from 50k people to 300k has a much greater effect than 300k to a million it seems.

Now we'll look at the actual content of the comments. I looked at how often certain things appeared in comments, internet slang (noob, pwn, leet, u, lol, lmao, etc, generally the ones I consider ""stupid"", so I didn't include TIL, IANAL, IMHO, FTFY, and stuff like that), insults (bitch, moron, stupid,  idiot, asshole, faggot, etc), and swearing (fuck, shit, damn, etc). Unfortunately I lost my script too so I don't have the precise list of what was included, but those words are the gist of it. This graph show a pretty [dramatic increase in all three](http://i.imgur.com/8URQB.png). This is also the metric that makes me most regret losing my data, because the internet slang (the most telling of the three in my opinion) appears to be skyrocketing. This one is also the only one that makes a case for Digg having an effect, since the internet slang went up so much, though be to fair it was months after the supposed migration.

Real quickly here is a chart for [no capital letter at the start of sentences, and no punctuation at the end.](http://i.imgur.com/I9VHU.png) Surprisingly this one is pretty much constant. Also this graph is normalized so they can appear next to each other, no punctuation was actually about 7x more common.

This next chart tracks how often various celebrities were mentioned on reddit. It includes [some people reddit loves, and some they hate](http://i.imgur.com/sm9fD.png). Here is the same chart with the huge spikes manually lowered [so you can see the rest of data better](http://i.imgur.com/wSmhw.png). Now I'll admit here that the idea behind this one was to laugh derisively at reddit for how they profess their love of Tesla and absolute hatred for Beiber, but they still talk about the latter 10 times more. Ha ha ha, stupid reddit! But it didn't really turn out that way. Although Glenn Beck was really mentioned the most, and Beiber was in fact mentioned more often than Tesla usually, it was pretty even, though that's still a little sad to be honest. I'll never understand why people feel the constant need to affirm how much they hate Beiber. It's like they don't understand that music can be targeting towards entirely different demographics than themselves.

So in conclusion, for the history of reddit, the data basically backs up what we all knew, reddit has changed. We have replace longer, more intelligent comments with shorter, more insulting, more slang filled, stupider comments. However, a lot of people claim that we can get around this by simply subscribing to the better subreddits, and I'll look at this claim next by comparing the subreddits to each other. Will /r/TrueReddit live up to it's grand vision of a reddit of the past? Is /r/atheism smarter than /r/christianity? Find out...well now.

Again we'll start out with the main attraction, [reading level](http://i.imgur.com/jZo77.png). /r/gonewild and /r/nswf come out at the bottom, but I guess you can hardly count it against them since they are typing the comments with one hand. /r/DoesAnyoneElse and /r/pics come out at the bottom of non-porn, non-joke subreddits. That's hardly a surprise to anyone, as those are widely considered two of the stupidest subreddits. The top also isn't very surprising, with /r/TrueReddit and /r/philosophy taking the cake. And yes, /r/christianity narrowly edges out /r/atheism. It's rather amusing because I got the whole idea to do this from the okcupid blog, where [they compared the grade level of various demographics](http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-real-stuff-white-people-like/) (at the bottom). /r/Atheism at the time was bragging about how Christians wrote their profile at a lower reading level, in what remains one of the most pathetic things to brag about of all time. I guess Christianity gets the last laugh on this one.

Now the [length of the comments](http://i.imgur.com/HOTQP.png). The chart looks pretty similar. One thing to note is that you'll see ""DIGG"" on both charts. That's not /r/digg, those are actually digg comments, however it should be totally ignored. I scraped about 200k Digg comments, however after some very strange results (particularly the massive disparity between the two types of grade level), I looked into the comments themselves and about half the comments were the same spam comment, and half of the rest where various other spam comments. It was a bunch of links to fake rolexes or something, which I think wasn't being displayed on the site but was still being returned by the api, so the data was ruined. I never had the time to go back and weed out the spam though so that data is pretty worthless.

One thing that is interesting is that /r/TrueReddit's data almost exactly lines up to the first year of reddit, so well done chaps!

Onward to [internet slang](http://i.imgur.com/DYK5I.png), [insults](http://i.imgur.com/wsQ4B.png), and [swearing](http://i.imgur.com/FMgEA.png). I guess not surprising /r/christianity has by far the least insults and swearing. I've never been subscribed to /r/videos, but apparently it is not a nice place. I'm a bit surprised /r/android was 2nd place in least insults, though I think that data might look a bit different today since so many posts are about how Apple is the devil, but I felt like that when these numbers were run the first time too, so I guess they keep it classy after all. After that /r/philosophy and /r/truereddit are at the top of the class again.

So in conclusion, reddit has gotten quite a bit stupider, which is obvious. Digg probably didn't have as much of an effect as people like to think, as things were already pretty much over at that point. But if you subscribe to the right places, and more importantly unsubscribe from the right places, I don't really think it's much different than it ever was. Oh yeah and always back up your data.

Will it overpower &amp; dominate it's competitors, like the Great Digg Migration of 2008, or will it coexist peacefully with the current social media giants?",,1244,278,993,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/15goza/is_reddit_experiencing_a_brain_drain_of_sorts_or/,"I've noticed an alarming trend over the course of the last year or so, really culminating in the last few months. The list of ""old guard"" redditors (and I use that term very loosely) who have either deleted their account, somehow gotten shadowbanned (which is easier than you may think) or all but abandoned their accounts is growing steadily. If you've been keeping tabs on the world of the meta reddits, you may recognize some or all of the names on this list... all have either deleted their accounts or been shadowbanned for one reason or another: 

* /u/Wordslinger1919
* /u/Saydrah
* /u/violentacrez
* /u/POLITE_ALLCAPS_GUY
* /u/ytknows
* /u/POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS
* /u/Scopolamina
* /u/youregonnaloveme
* /u/Lautrichienne

These are just a few off the top of my head. I'm sure there are many I've missed or forgotten. Now, I know that a few of those names wouldn't be considered ""braniacs"" by any means. The individual users are not what I want to focus on here, but the overall trend of active users becoming burnt out, so to speak, and throwing in the proverbial towel. There are several other high-profile users (notably, /u/kleinbl00) who have significantly decreased their reddit activity while not abandoning the site completely. Some of these users have most likely created alternate reddit accounts that they are using instead (in fact, I know with certainty that several have), but one thing I have noticed is that some of these users are active on a site called [Hubski](http://www.hubski.com) - an interesting experiment in social media that appears to combine elements of reddit and twitter. [Here's a link to kleinbl00's ""hub""](http://hubski.com/hub?id=kleinbl00). [Here's a link to Saydrah's.](http://hubski.com/hub?id=Saydrah) [Here's mine.](http://hubski.com/hub?id=syncretic)

I've been browsing Hubski off and on for over a year, submitting content on occasion, but it hasn't quite succeeded in completely pulling me away from reddit... yet. My interest in the social media website has been growing steadily, however, as reddit continues to grow and the admins seemingly continue to distance themselves from the community (Best of 2012 awards, anyone?). I feel like reddit is on track to become the next Facebook or Youtube, which is great for reddit as a company. Unfortunately, I don't have any interest to be a part of Facebook or Youtube. I use their services to the extent that they are essentially unavoidable, but I don't spend a large amount of my free time on either of those websites.

The biggest difference between Hubski and reddit is that instead of subscribing to subreddits, you follow individual users, or hashtags. Their use of hashtags as opposed to subreddits is extremely appealing to me. When you submit an article, you can choose a single tag. It can be anything you like, but you are limited to a single tag. After you submit it, and it is viewed &amp; shared by others, other users can suggest a ""[community tag](http://hubski.com/pub?id=42878)"" - which can then, in turn, be voted upon by the community, and even alternate tags suggested (the most popular tag will be displayed as the community tag). The original tag and the community tag cannot be the same thing.

Another thing that sets Hubski apart from reddit is the ability to create ""hybrid posts"" - you can include a bit of text with every link submission - perhaps a quote from the article, or a paragraph or two of your personal thoughts on the subject. How often has that been suggested for reddit? A lot - [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/ptci4/allow_moderators_to_choose_either_link_or_text_as/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/h4lir/you_should_be_able_to_combined_text_and_link/), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/zeq1h/link_text_post_combo/), [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/9knvm/have_an_optional_text_box_like_all_self_posts/), etc. It also appears that reddit has recently taken a page from Hubski's book - [the icon for gilded comments look strikingly similar to Hubski's badges, introduced almost a year prior.](http://hubski.com/pub?id=48494) Coincidence? Possibly.

I don't know what the reddit admins have up their sleeves, or where they intend for reddit to go during this period of explosive growth, or when/if this period of explosive growth will ever end. I do know that talking about the downfall of reddit has been the popular thing to do [since comments were originally introduced](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/17913/reddit_now_supports_comments/c66), so, /r/TheoryOfReddit, shall we indulge ourselves once again in some good, old fashioned doom &amp; gloom?

Is reddit experiencing a ""brain drain"" of sorts, or just growing pains? How long will it be until the Next Big Thing in social media takes off? Will it overpower &amp; dominate it's competitors, like the Great Digg Migration of 2008, or will it coexist peacefully with the current social media giants?

1360881803.0,930,self.TheoryOfReddit,18jm8j,Comparing structure and humor between Reddit and 4chan,aero-deck,1229,299,836,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/18jm8j/comparing_structure_and_humor_between_reddit_and/,"I am curious to know if anyone has given much thought to the structural differences between Reddit and 4chan (registration/anonmynity, upvoting/sage, thread organization and appearence) and how these differences might influence the respective styles of discourse on the sites. 

I've been a /b/-tard longer than I have been a redditor and my impression of the sites are the following: 
4chan is funny and libidinal, yet shallow and ephemeral - it is good to read from a poetic point of view
Reddit is self-absorbed yet filled with interesting technical reading. 

Specifically, the jokes on 4chan are much better and I want to understand why. 

My feeling is that since 4chan is an anonymous community, the only means of establishing membership to that community is a mastery of the memes that propogate through it (here it is good to note that 'meme' can refer to highly stylized image macros as well as the general structure of a thread (a roll thread is an example of such)). User status in 4chan is determined uniquely by the fluency in the discourse, and hence the social dynamics of the space foster the development of users who are highly adept at manipulating the site's unique language. This fluency that I have noticed is far beyond the ability to deploy a meme (i.e. to fill in a formatted image with one's own content), but extends into the ability to subvert it. Those that are capable of smartly subverting the sites language are the users that reap the most praise from the community. Furthermore, I think that the sites 'fuck everything' attitude comes from both the anonymity (you don't have to hold yourself responsable for what you say) and from the fact that insults are easier to craft than compliments. 

 This constant subversion and undermining of the site's own language is exactly what makes 4chan chaotic (along with the fact that posts last an average of 40 minutes b4 they 404) and also leads to REALLY great reading. Once you have a little ear-training for the site 1) you start to get the jokes and 2) get to appreciate th wonderful ways the site mutates over time. Furthermore, because of the fact that understand the language of the site is so crucial, it creates the conditions for great jokes played at the expense of others such as fingerboxes and del sys32. 

Keep in mind here that this is all due to the site's anonymity. Reddit, on the other hand, uses karma - which creates the kind of self-fulfilling dynamics that I have seen analyzed in a lot of Theory of Reddit posts. I certainly think that the meme-quality (aside: I wanted to say writing quaility, but that does not make sense in this context. funny how we don't have a term for the ability to write stylishly within an ideosyncratic system of communication (I have seen some articles about technical/scientific writing style, but I don't think these are concominant simply because memes can involve pictures n' shit)) is vastly inferior to reddits. I think this is because of two things: 

1) posts persist longer on reddit and therefore the work involved in writing a long, detailed post is not wasted - a user can gain status in the community for writing one - and the work involved is not wasted (in 4chan, the work necessary to become fluent takes a while to learn, but takes seconds to deploy - therefore the lack of a status accrual is not a problem since within a thread the relational notion of status is re-affirmed as the thread develops). 

2) there exist subreddits. This means that likeminded individuals can find a dedicated location in which to suck each others dicks. On 4chan dick sucking happens too, but the categories are much less specific and threads eventually die. therefore, there is no dedicated place for such activity to occur - which means that if your goal on the site is to placate your own worldview then there is a low probability that will actually occur. On reddit it is the opposite - there is a whole road to user status based on never writing a good post, never being funny, only re-affirming other people's beliefs - which they will of course give you karma for. 

In the end, there is much less stress on reddit on meme-quality simply because there are other ways in which to be active in the community. 

Let me know what you guys think of this account, find holes in it and tell me of similar thoughts. I spend a lot of tme thinking about internet discourse and want to explore these issues further (and maybe even formally).

tl;dr 

4chan creates conditions where an understanding of the sites in-jokes and tropes are crucial to participating - fostering hyperliteracy - fostering wit. Part of the cost born in this is ephemerality. 

Reddit users can participate without fully understanding its in-jokes and tropes - which means the humor sucks, but instead there exists things like 4/theoryofreddit.

Earlier today I was putzing around [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/pzae8/worst_type_of_feminist) and I stumbled upon this one person's [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/pzae8/worst_type_of_feminist/c3tfs6i):

&gt;[the concept of sexism is] similar to how society thinks you can only be racist if you're white.

I had to respond. I had to point out that, sure white people can experience racial discrimination - but the institutional aspect of racial discrimination is pretty much reserved for minorities. 

And then the downvotes came, which was understandable, [and the trolls](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/pzae8/worst_type_of_feminist/c3tluxp) which was expected. But I got a lot of responses from people who seemed ...  well ... *angry* that I was calling *them* racists when all I was doing was saying institutional discrimination doesn't apply to white people. One poster even went so far as to imply that even if I was right [I shouldn't be so incendiary when I throw the hypocrisy of racial discrimination and white privilege in people's faces](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/pzae8/worst_type_of_feminist/c3tiqh3). 

My favorite comment was ""the reason racism still exists is that [black people are scary when they're angry and illogical](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/pzae8/worst_type_of_feminist/c3thegc)."" If black people stopped being angry and irrational, racism would go away  &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;


I was going to write something like *A Reddit-Style History of Racism in America For Redditors*, but I'm honestly not sure it's worth the effort. Partly because of the vitriol, but also because of the caliber of the discussions I've been in about race on reddit. I also don't think writing such a thing is good enough because there seems to be a vocal group of redditors who will deny institutional discrimination exists (especially white privilege) to the last breath. 

There's also the fact that people much smarter than me, including the late Derrick Bell, did this for years with a bigger audience and didn't really get anything out of it. Except a tenured position at NYU Law School (after resigning in protest from Harvard Law School), but that's not really the point. The point is, I'm not sure I'll do the subject justice.

I don't know - a part of this is really important to me because some of these redditors are people out in the world making decisions and interacting with people who don't look like them. I feel a little obligated for my own sake to ""enlighten"" them. It's not like I can avoid them in the real world like I can online. I don't ascribe to the Morgan Freeman School of *Let's Not Talk About Race To Make It Go Away*. To me, that's just a way of silencing any critical analysis of a subject that affects us all.

On the other hand, they're strangers on the internet. I owe them nothing. Their ignorance is their own fault. If I encounter their ignorance in the real world, that would be the perfect time to slap it down. Posting at any great depth about reddit's slight race problem is an inefficient use of time. And many of them will [completely misunderstand or misconstrue my point anyway](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/pzae8/worst_type_of_feminist/c3tk7hn).

In the end, I think I identified ~~the~~ one thing you can't talk about on reddit constructively - white privilege. It steps on too many toes.

**Edit**: I'm pleased (and frankly amazed) that this got so much traction. I couldn't possibly respond to everyone so I want to thank you for the comments, critiques, and messages of encouragement. 

For everyone else, I got a lot of the same comments/questions so I'll answer them here.

**But my girlfriend works as a recruiter and she says unqualified minorities are hired all the time**

Your girlfriend is anecdotal. Anecdotes don't prove anything. And her job isn't ""all the time.""

**But white people are the minority globally**

As long as we have national sovereignty, that doesn't mean a thing. Racial policies are country-specific. I'm talking about America, not the world. 

**You're just claiming it's okay for black people to be racist**

No, I'm pointing out institutional discrimination exists and it hurts minorities. How does this imply that it's okay for minorities to discriminate?

**Right, but you're *implying* it!**

...

**Why do you have to call it white privilege? That just turns white people off.**

So? My job is to make the argument that it exists. Being annoyed at my terminology doesn't mean that I'm wrong, it means you're feeling offended. I care more about describing institutional discrimination's effect on minorities than I care about how labeling institutional discrimination offends you. We aren't talking about you or your hurt feelings, we're talking about how institutional discrimination affects minorities. 

**But you're doing the same thing! You're setting the paramters of the debate!**

Damn right I am, I want to talk about how institutional discrimination and white privilege work, *not* how you feel offended by my use of the terms.

Only 15% percent of the hottest 200 submissions were any outside text content. The rest was either media or self posts. New users to the current reddit see it primarily as an image board, not as a link aggregator. The absolute majority of submissions ( 70%) are images which you can view in-line.  This sets a worrying trend where new users to reddit subscribe because they like the content of the front page. New reddit.com visitors who aren't familiar with the site but enjoy more in-depth content and discussion won't find anything to their liking and will most likely move on to other things.

This could be the ""fall of reddit"". That the site turns into an image aggregator with very little to non-existant quality content. With the sites growth continuing to speed up and as new users mainly belong to the new demography which enjoys primarily images I fear the  demographic that enjoyes more in-depth discussion and quality content will start to decrease in size.

1344096588.0,627,self.TheoryOfReddit,xoafm,"The Cult of ""Reason"": On the Fetishization of the Sciences on Reddit",AFlatCap,832,205,421,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/xoafm/the_cult_of_reason_on_the_fetishization_of_the/,"Hello Redditors of TOR. Today I would like to extend to you a very simple line of thought (and as such this will be light on data). As you may guess from the title of this post, it's about the way science is handled on Reddit. One does not need to go far in order to find out that Reddit loves science. You can go to r/science, r/technology, r/askscience, r/atheism... all of these are core subreddits and from their popularity we can see the grip science holds on Redditors' hearts. 

However, what can also be seen is that Redditors fall into a cultural perception of the sciences: to state the obvious, not every Redditor is a university professor or researcher. The majority of them are common folk, relying mostly on pop science and the occasional study that pops up in the media in order to feed their scientific knowledge. This, unfortunately, feeds something I like to call 'The Cult of Reason', after the short-lived institution from the French Revolution. Let's begin.

**The Cultural Perception of the Sciences in Western Society**

To start, I'd like to take a look at how science is perceived in our society. Of course, most of us know that scientific institutions are themselves about the application of the scientific method, peer-review, discussion, theorizing, and above all else: change. Unfortunately, these things don't necessarily show through into our society. Carl Sagan lamented in his book The Demon-Haunted World how scientific education seemed not to be about teaching science, but instead teaching scientific 'facts'. News reports of the latest study brings up how scientists have come to a conclusion, a 'fact' about our world. People see theories in their explanation, not their formulation. This is, of course, problematic, as it does not convey the steps that scientists have to go through in order to come to their conclusions, nor does it describe how those conclusions are subject to change.

Redditors, being members of our society and huge fans of pop-science, absorb a lot of what the cultural perception of science gives to them.

**Redditors and Magic**

Anthropologists see commonly in cultures religious beliefs which can invoke what they call 'magic' or the supernatural. The reason why I call what Redditors have ""The Cult of Reason"" is because when discussing science, they exhibit what I see as a form of imitative magic. Imitative magic is the idea that ""like causes like"". The usual example of this is the voodoo doll, but I'd much rather invoke the idea of a cargo cult, and the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. 

It is common on Reddit when in debate, to see Redditors dip into what I like to call the 'scientific style'. When describing women's behaviour, for example, they go into (unfounded) talk about how evolution brought about the outcome. This is, of course, common pseudoscience, but I would propose that they are trying to imitate people who do science in order to add to the 'correctness' of their arguments. They can also be agitated is you propose a contrary theory, as if you do not see the 'logic and reason' of their arguments. Make note of this for the next section.

Through this, we can also come to see another characteristic of the Cult of Reason.

**Science as a Bestower of Knowledge (Or Science as a Fetish)** 

You'll note that as per the last section (if you listened to me and made note of it), that Redditors will often cling to their views as correct after they've styled it up as science. Of course, this could be common arrogance, but I see it as part of the cultural perception in society, and as a consequence on Reddit, as a bestower of facts. Discussions of studies leap instantly to the conclusions made, not of the study itself or its methodology or what else the study means. Editorialization is common, with the conclusion given to Redditors in the title of the post so they don't need to think about all the information given or look for the study to find out (as often what's linked is a news article, not the actual study). This, of course, falls under the common perception of science Reddit is used to, but is accepted gladly.

You can also see extremes to this. Places like /r/whiterights constantly use statistics in order to justify their racism, using commonly criticized or even outdated science without recognition for science as an evolving entity. 

All of this appears to point to Redditors seeing Science as something of an all-knowing God bestowing knowledge upon them, no thought required. Of course, this leads to problems, as you see in the case of /r/whiterights, in Redditors merely affirming deeply unscientific beliefs to themselves. But I'll leave that for you to think over for yourselves. 

**Conclusion**

Thank you for taking to the time to read my little scrawl. Of course, all of this is merely a line of thought about things, with only my observations to back it up, so feel free to discuss your views of how Redditors handle science in the comments.

Reddit is, above all, a corporate business investment. One where the owners (Advance Publications) and employees [have a contractual incentive to create a company valuation of over $240 million…and to then sell.]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2012/10/31/what-is-reddit-worth/)

[Reddit users and moderators are the product]( http://mashable.com/2012/11/30/monetize-community-reddit/) - no surprise there. Unfortunately, reddit continues to lose money for investors while, at the same time, experiencing tremendous growth.


[Investors and management are concerned about becoming Digg 2.0]( http://www.techradar.com/us/news/internet/web/whatever-happened-to-digg-1093422) - where the quest for profitability destroys the site itself.  On the other hand, you have Facebook valuations as a guiding light.  

Discuss whether users and moderators can (or should) have a significant say in how Reddit can become profitable.  I personally believe it’s in our best interest if we want the site to survive and if we would like to sustain the community.

Wall of details below.  

**DISCLOSURE:**  I’m a long-term redditor and mod with zero interest in reddit outside of my desire to keep the community alive.  In 2006, I worked for a tech firm and personally evaluated reddit as an acquisition candidate.  (We passed on the opportunity without exchanging confidential information.)  The following is solely based on publicly available information plus M&amp;A and reddit experience.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Reddit Business History – Follow the Money**

At the end of 2006, Condé Nast bought Reddit from [Alexis Ohanian, Steve Huffman, Y Combinator and other investors for an undisclosed amount]( http://www.inc.com/magazine/201206/christine-lagorio/alexis-ohanian-reddit-how-i-did-it.html) – ranging anywhere from less than $5 million to [$10-20 million.]( http://betabeat.com/2012/06/how-erik-martin-king-bee-of-reddits-hive-mind-harnessed-the-buzz-clocking-2-5-billion-pageviews-the-site-has-left-the-conde-mothership/)  

Since inception, [Reddit has never been profitable. ]( http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/12v8y3/now_is_the_time_to_invest_in_gold/c6yfbuh)  That’s not a problem if you are an entrepreneur whose main goal is to sell the company to a corporation.  Simply cash out and either move on (Huffman) or also stick around to run the business as well (Ohanian).  The issue is that Reddit has been owned by a corporation for six years.  That’s a long time for an investment of $___ millions to make negative returns.

Reddit has struggled with implementing traditional revenue generating approaches like advertising.  Part of the issue is the reddit community – we simply do not like advertising or promotions.  [Some viral campaigns do well]( http://www.urlesque.com/2010/07/15/old-spice-man-response-videos/) but these do not always bring in revenues.   [The basic advertising program isn’t the best.]( http://blog.crunched.com/results-of-the-crunched-com-reddit-advertising-campaign-fail/)

In mid-2010, [reddit management told the community that the site didn’t have enough money to keep up with growth. ]( http://blog.reddit.com/2010/07/reddit-needs-help.html)  Condé Nast was tired of funding Reddit and it wasn’t bringing in enough money.  

&gt;The bottom line is, we need more resources. 

&gt;Whenever this topic comes up on the site, someone always posts a comment about how reddit is owned by Conde Nast, a billion-dollar corporation like Time Warner or Cobra, and how if they wanted to they could hire a thousand engineers and purchase a million dollars worth of heavy iron. But here's the thing: corporations aren't run like charities. They keep separate budgets for each business line, and usually allocate resources proportionate to revenue. And reddit's revenue isn't great. 

[Thus the launch of Reddit Gold – a virtual bake sale that has helped to keep the lights on.]( http://blog.reddit.com/2010/07/it-was-triumph.html)  From a multi-billion dollar corporation perspective that money is cute. Like a puppy.  It’s not enough to make reddit profitable, but it buys time.


**Make Reddit Worth $240+ Million, Attract Investors and Sell**

At the end of 2011, Reddit was shifted from under Condé Nast to a [new structure under Condé Nast’s parent company, Advance Publications.]( http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/independence.html)  It’s a bit of corporate ownership shuffling where the original owner pulled reddit from under a subsidiary and isolated it under a new ownership structure.  

Good news is that this type of structuring means reddit is valuable to the parent.  For some reason, most of the media and redditors have missed the other implications.  [Last month, Forbes contributor John Anders got it right…](http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2012/10/31/what-is-reddit-worth/)

Simply put, the goal is to monetize the site and to then sell *part* or *all* of it:

* Reddit was recapitalized (the original investors were bought out) and ownership was shifted from Condé Nast to the parent company, Advance Publications.  The new deal is that if Reddit is valued (and sold) for over $240 million, employees and Advanced Publications will share proportionately in the sale. If it is less, then Reddit employees get less.

* The site currently has a burn rate of over $7 million per year.  The way Reddit handles advertising and Reddit Gold today does not bring in enough money to cover costs.  

* Mainstream advertisers see reddit as being to ‘bohemian’.  Even those who are good with reddit are concerned about the darker corners of the site.  “As long as we don’t participate in categories of Reddit that raise questions,” [Aaron Magness, vice president for marketing at Coastal.com] says, “we’re safe.”


**Why This Matters to Redditors**

[Reddit managers and board members are struggling to make the site profitable while, at the same time, to hold the site together. ]( http://mashable.com/2012/11/30/monetize-community-reddit/)  They don’t have the answers, but have been trying to find non-traditional ways [like the new redditgifts.com marketplace]( http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/) and Reddit Gold.  

Should we care?  What type of (profitable) changes to Reddit are we willing to accept?  What are we not?  Is it less about the addition of advertising or search revenues and more about *how* these are implemented?

Personally, I’m rooting for them to keep the site rolling and I would be fine with traditional ads and the like in order for reddit to pay the bills.  I also believe that the site would be more valuable to new owners if the reddit community was on-board with how these revenues are generated. If the owners and employees make millions along the way, then so be it as well.  Not sure if the average redditor agrees, though.

1359336467.0,487,self.TheoryOfReddit,17efhm,"One of many terrible trends on reddit that should be banned, as it is taking over the site: Over - Personalization of titles.",hyperhopper,594,107,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/17efhm/one_of_many_terrible_trends_on_reddit_that_should/,"I have been commenting on this for months now, but I feel with the recent picture it is now finally being realized. Reddit titles are no longer about describing the content of the link, but adding context, or trying to entice users to upvote. Since titles are being engineered to gain upvotes, only those posts will make it to the front page. 

As a link aggregator, the fact that titles dont tell me what the link is, is a sad state of affairs.

The most prevelant type of manipulation I can find is overpersonalization. Instead of titling a post ""A cool painting depicting bipolar emotions"", we get titles like ""Check out what my girlfriend made"". This works because personalized titles talking about girlfriends, grandparents, and disabled family members let other users feel sympathy or a connection to the post, and then upvote it because of that (even though they shouldnt). Look on /r/gaming, /r/pics, most anything, and see how many times you see personalized titles. 

Even if there is no logical reason it could be personalized, personalization still works. Instead of calling it like it is, this picture of a normal woman in WW2 was personalized by the assumtion that she then became a grandma: [""Somebody's Grandma being a badass in world war 2""](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/176rqb/somebodys_grandma_being_a_badass_in_ww2/)

[This post personalized by just recalling a nostalgic feeling,](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/17dybt/that_smell/) and that is the basis for almost all box art screenshots of old games reaching the front of /r/gaming.

People even lie about their relations on a regular basis. I have called many out, [even the content creators have,](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/17dd8f/bipolarity_someone_on_reddit_claimed_this/), but users will continue to do it until it no longer works.

In the past, when a certain trend was completely dominating the front page and had an extremely unfair advantage. Examples of this include the old DAE posts from when reddit was small, Upvote if you X posts, and all the banned types from old reddit. This needs to be added the the list, as personalization of titles is making writing descriptive titles counterproductive and is defeating the point of even having titles.

1340118231.0,416,self.TheoryOfReddit,va102,r/atheism has just fallen to last place in numbers of subscribers of all default subreddits. Should we reconsider what goes into making a subreddit default?,twentyone_21,598,182,325,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/va102/ratheism_has_just_fallen_to_last_place_in_numbers/,"First, I want to start with some statistics: 

* Using the last set of data from www.redditlist.com, the 14-day new subscriber average for all defaults is 65,377. /r/atheism had, over the past two weeks, a subscriber trend approximately 33% less than the mean, at 43,313 new subscribers.  
* The data from the default subreddits gives a standard deviation of roughly 7,000 subscribers.  *(Note that the SD would be half of this if r/atheism and r/politics were discarded from this mean calculation, but I included their low numbers so it would be more honest)*
* This makes /r/atheism's subscriber trends roughly 3.1 standard deviations from the mean.  
* Assuming normal distribution, there is **~0.2% chance** that r/atheism's low number of subscriber additions are due to chance.

Now, here are some possibilities, with conjectures of probability, I have considered for this happening:

* Users are creating Reddit accounts to remove /r/atheism (also, probably /r/politics too) from their front page. (likely)  
* Long-time subscribers are unsubscribing *en masse* to /r/atheism. (less likely)  
* Long-time Redditors are subscribing to the other default subreddits, except of /r/atheism. (unlikely)  
* A combination of the above. (most likely)

Possible motives for people unsubscribing that I have considered:

* Low quality/effort content? (this doesn't explain why /r/AdviceAnimals is higher, though)  
* It somewhat claims to be a haven of logic and reason, yet it is consistently filled with low quality/effort content, strawmen arguments, and lack of quality discussion? (this could explain the first conjecture)  
* People are tired of the angry vitriol?

_____

**Okay, off the theory of why /r/atheism has not made the gains that other default subreddits have been seeing. Now: onto theory of what a default subreddit should be like:**

1. Should a default subreddit be inherently *exclusive* towards one viewpoint? Of course, outsiders are allowed for discussion, but this subreddit is made to inherently be biased towards one position. One can say that /r/politics is biased, but it inherently allows for discussion of all political views.

2. Do polarizing subreddits lower the level of discourse on the site as a whole? [Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman certainly thought so, and thought it was enough to remove r/atheism from the default list in the past.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9efxf/an_explanation_of_why_the_atheism_reddit_does_not/)

3. Does making a subreddit default hurt the subreddit's quality? Note that /r/askscience un-defaulted themselves for this reason, as it became harder to moderate and remove poor content with the huge influx of traffic.

4. Is there a better alternative to subscriber count in determining whether or not a subreddit should be a default?

5. Should we have default subreddits at all? If not, what would be a good alternative for the front page?

6. Should a default subreddit be un-defaulted if it cannot retain a certain number of new users as subscribers?

1335035868.0,410,self.TheoryOfReddit,sllnz,Reddit is not a city-state.,blackstar9000,495,85,148,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/sllnz/reddit_is_not_a_citystate/,"You may have seen Yishan Wong's recent AMA. Wong, in case you didn't know, is the recently appointed CEO of Reddit. Several times in his AMA, Wong drew an analogy between Reddit and a city-state. [This is probably the most elaborate statement of the analogy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sk1ut/iam_yishan_wong_the_reddit_ceo/c4en44e) There are other references to the idea [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sk1ut/iam_yishan_wong_the_reddit_ceo/c4eoatp?context=1), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sk1ut/iam_yishan_wong_the_reddit_ceo/c4eo4f8?context=1), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sk1ut/iam_yishan_wong_the_reddit_ceo/c4eq4s9?context=1) – inter alia, when you get right down to it. It looks like, at least under Wong's management, [city-state is the official party line](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sk1ut/iam_yishan_wong_the_reddit_ceo/c4epsow).

There's an inherent appeal to the analogy, not least of all because of the associations it conjures up with the classical period of Athenian democracy. The problem, it seems to me, is that it's a bit out of date.

Let's get one thing out of the way right from the start. Reddit is not a democracy. Yes, we all get to vote on what submissions make it to the front page, but that vote is ultimately attenuated by the moderators' power to remove posts. Most of the functions of this site that approximate to actual political structures are fundamentally non-democratic. The ability to vote on submissions is like the ability to vote on a television station's programming line-up. It's pretty cool, but if the laws governing broadcasting are still beyond your reach, then it doesn't really make television democratic, now does it? So even if Reddit *is* a city-state, we probably shouldn't think of it in terms of the city-state that most of us think of when we read that word.

(While we're at it, what's the ""state"" part of Wong's ""city-state"" analogy? It looks to me as though what he's describing is a city, and I don't really see what's added by elevating it to the status of a state – unless, of course, it's just the Athenian connotation.)

There likely was a time when Reddit functioned *more* like a city-state, back in the days when there was a single front page, no subs, and no mods. At lot has happened since then, and they've changed the structural reality of the site. As things currently stand, I would say that a more accurate analogy is that **Reddit is a proto-feudalism**.

That may be a little confusing. After all, a city-state is a political *entity*, while feudalism is a political *system*. So we're shifting metaphors a bit here. That's significant, not least of all because what Reddit offers via subreddits really does approximate more accurately to a system. That's part of the point, and hopefully the importance of that shift will be clear to you as I round out the analogy. Something of the sort was part of the message when the admins of the pre-Wong era emphasized the point that Reddit is less a community than it is [an engine for creating communities](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/how-reddit-works.html). Part of what I'm saying here is that, far from being a unified city-state built out of a network of neighborhoods and enclaves, Reddit is more like a particular political system, a political model that can be stamped on any number of communities, some of which will be deeply inimical to others.

So let's talk a little about feudalism. The basic idea is that there are certain prominent individuals, and less prominent individuals want to align themselves to those people. They do so by swearing ""fealty"" to them. There's a whole culture to fealty, but the basic premise is that they promise certain sorts of service to their new leader in exchange for the outlay they need to set themselves up – traditionally, at least in European feudalism, land, horses and maybe some armor and weapons. That's because the service they usually pledged was military – they were promising to serve as knights to help their new lord protect his material interests. There's a really interesting book on how that system got started in the West, [*Medieval Technology and Social Change*](http://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Technology-Social-Change-White/dp/0195002660), but the short answer is: stirrups. That is to say, small technological changes made the social system viable, and that led to huge shifts in the culture of the entire continent.

Something of the sort has been happening over the years here on Reddit. Several structural changes have made those shifts possible, including subreddits, moderation, and growth.

So how does the analogy work? Subreddits arise like fiefdoms under the absolute control of its moderators. Redditors who subscribe to a reddit are essentially pledging a sort of low-level fealty to those moderators, since that fief is then where they can be expected to do the majority of their redditing – submitting, voting, commenting, and so forth. The subscriber gets a venue, much the same way that the medieval vassal got land (think of the submit button as a horse); the moderator gets activity for their reddit. And as on a medieval fiefdom, the lord/moderator serves as the court of appeal for the behavior of the vassals.

The analogy is extensible in interesting ways. For example, the large your fiefdom in medieval Europe, the more you could expect to gain, since future generations could, by and large, by expected to become your vassals. Likewise, on Reddit, 15 or so default reddits have the most ""feudalspace"" in the sense that their subscriberships give them enough activity to occupy a privileged position on the site. That creates a self-perpetuating system whereby they continue to gain more and more vassals, both because new accounts are automatically subscribed to them, and because, even without that advantage, their relative power makes them attractive to potential subscriber/vassals.

Of course, no analogy is perfect. There are differences between medieval feudal vassalage and subscribership. The point is simply that, *in effect*, that structure lends itself to results that make it more and more resemble feudalism. Thus, we end up with a kind of neo-tribalism, as with the beefs between groups like /r/MensRights and /r/TwoXChromosomes, or the general tensions that surround a reddit like SRS.

Even where the relations between reddits don't resolve to outright tribalism, there's a difficulty in coordinating activities that resists the city analogy. For example, I've seen a lot of positive reactions to projects like /r/advocacy, but when it comes time to set up the sort of partnerships that project needs *across subreddit lines*, communal ties rapidly break down. There are virtually no ""city-wide"" projects on Reddit. There are just individual fiefs that can, in most cases, be counted upon to go their own way.

We see the effects also in the more or less unsuccessful attempts to map other analogies onto reddits. Over at /r/RepublicOfReddit, we tried to draft a set of policies that would allow for democratic elections. Even the most workable systems we were able to contrive ended up rubbing against the grain of Reddit. As a result, elections are difficult to manage, with miniscule turn-outs, and so far no significant differences in the sorts of outcomes is the mods had simply acted unilaterally. The point here is that, even when we try to behave democratically, the structure of the site pushes us back toward feudalism.

And where do the admins stand in all of this? I would say that they're a great deal like the medieval Vatican – an extra-national body that exerts a great deal of influence on the structural level, but that is too small to function as a constant governing body. They can, for example, use that power to organize the [occasional crusade](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html), or to excommunicate [some heretic Albigensians](http://www.reddit.com/r/violentacrez/comments/l7mde/the_admins_have_decided_to_shut_down_rjailbait/c2qg3xb), but they remain, in a sense, not city planners, but an extra-national power that acts by shaping the political system, rather than the actual shape of the community.

Maybe Mr. Wong and co. would like for Reddit to function more like a city-state. If so, they have some way to go. As best I can tell, it's on its way toward a form of feudalism. All it would take is an innovation as simple yet significant as the stirrup to push us beyond proto-feudalism, and toward a more full-blown variety.

I mention all of this because I think it's important, if we're going to have a positive effect at the grass-roots and moderator level, to understand Reddit as it really is, rather than as we'd like to see it. Behaving as though Reddit functioned like a city-state is likely to lead us down some wrong avenues unless it's true that Reddit really *does* function that way. Understanding that it doesn't can give us clarity on what needs to happen in order to make it function according to that ideal.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_sllnz,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/sllnz/reddit_is_not_a_citystate/,

Many online communities ask their members to do work for the good of everyone on the site. On social voting sites like Reddit, this means that users judge a stream of incoming links by voting them up or down. The links with the most up-votes bubble up to the main page, pointing everyone toward the best content. A threat to all sites designed this way, however, is underprovision: when too many people rely on others to contribute without doing so themselves. In this paper, we present findings suggesting that widespread underprovision of votes is happening on Reddit, arguably the internet’s largest social voting community. Notably, Reddit overlooked 52% of the most popular links the first time they were submitted. This suggests that many potentially popular links get ignored, jeopardizing the site’s core purpose. We conclude by discussing possible reasons behind it, and suggest future research on social voting sites.

We all have little things that keep bringing up back to reddit, despite its tendency to confound or annoy or infuriate us.  It might be a niche interest, a small community that can’t be replicated elsewhere, or a Sisyphean determination to wade through the defaults for the occasional nugget of insight. 

For me, it’s been a longstanding fascination with what makes the hivemind tick.  I may even be the most determined comment-miner on the site - when I see a comment of unusual bravery, I’ll often spend ages digging through their history just to figure out [just what kind of person they are](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/w6m5m/circlebroke_i_challenge_you_to_find_a_more/).  I’ve long found that the hivemind of reddit presents an endlessly fascinating specimen, most particularly due to its ability to proudly maintain a host of bewildering quirks:

* Proudly leftist and staunchly pro gay rights, but cruelly dismissive any issues affecting women or minorities

* Priding itself on being attentive to propaganda, and yet eager to make a cause celebre out of someone like Kim Dotcom, whose self promotion can only be described as [propaganda of the crudest kind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MokNvbiRqCM&amp;feature=player_embedded).

* Insisting that Gawker links be banned in the name of free speech

* Furiously waving the flag for Palestinian independence while flippantly rejecting Tibet

* Continuing to repeat a joke at length, far beyond the point at which anyone could possibly find it funny 

Years of carefully studying the hive (I’ll bump up against my fourth anniversary soon) have led me to believe that the quirks which animate its peculiar psychology can be broken down to a number of core concepts, and that once you add these concepts to your toolkit the otherwise inexplicable whims or the hive start to make a great deal more sense.  If you’ll follow me, what follows is an attempt to collect these core concepts, most of which have hitherto been bandied about in various comments and threads, and organize them into a singe integrated document.

**THE CIRCLEJERK**

Far and away, the most striking and characteristic aspect of the hivemind - perhaps even its definitive trait - is the circlejerk.  Now, in one sense, the tendency to circlejerk is not itself a terribly unusual tendency, as any group of people sharing an enthusiastic agreement will inevitably tend towards smug in group congratulation.  What makes reddit’s circlejerking so strange, however, is how whimsical the topics seem to be.  Any casual visitor to reddit is well-versed with its obsession with a strange set of narrow, peculiar interests.  The good folks at circlebroke have documented circlejerks over how [Osama bin Laden wasn’t such a bad guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/wdnvr/good_guy_osama_bin_laden/), [two dollar bills](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yfgxx/an_ehipster_and_his_legal_tender/), [swastikas](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/134zvz/the_swastika_has_nothing_to_do_with_nazis_now/), [North Korean propaganda](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/wjuf3/reddit_upvotes_obviously_fake_north_korean/), and a host of other topics.  Why such a fixation on such peculiar issues?

**SECOND OPTION BIAS**

The seminal post on this topic was made by /u/douglasmacarthur, in which [he coined the term] (http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yngzi/reddits_strange_affinity_for_socialism_how/c5x6adc) **""second option bias.""**  In a nutshell, second option bias refers to the tendency of the typical hiver to tack to the opposite of whatever happens to be a commonly accepted view in his milieu without undertaking any sort of serious or good-faith analysis of the strengths in that position.  Second-option bias is such a widely prevalent phenomenon among certain demographics that I was struck to see /u/Cenodoxus describing [nearly the identical phenomenon in remarkably similar language here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/12zp30/what_work_has_done_the_most_damage_to_your_field/c6zmzih), when discussing the dangers of taking revisionist history too seriously.

**SNOWFLAKING**

But why would second option bias come to be such a defining characteristic of the community?  It is clearly identifiable as a trend, but what motivates it?  For a deeper read on the psychological needs which animate the typical hiver you may want to read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebrokediscussion/comments/11c6z9/what_is_your_vision_of_the_typical_redditor/c6li3yr), but it may be sufficient for now to introduce the concept of **snowflaking.**  Snowflaking describes the need of certain people to aggressively promote their individuality by insisting upon various ideas, tastes and practices that are intended to separate them from the crowd.  Snowflaking is, of course, not unique to reddit, but it conspicuously manifests itself in various forms:

* The way every thread on music inevitably turns into a “can you name a more obscure artist” contest

* The insistence on belonging to an unfairly persecuted class of people

* The loud rejection of every identifiable aspect of American culture, no matter how petty or obscure

* The proud ignorance of celebrities (see also:  [Alpha Nerding](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2670))

**JERK ALPHA**

The king of all jerks, however, the sun around which jerks revolve, is clearly the “I am a misunderstood genius” jerk.  Because this is the jerk which spawns and influences nearly every other jerk the hiveosphere, I refer to it as **Jerk Alpha**.  It is the combination of Jerk Alpha and snowflaking that that yields second-option bias, and its infamous connections with bravery.  You see, it is not quite enough to be a misunderstood genius, the opinions the hiver holds must also be dangerous and unconventional.  For a typical example of these factors all playing out in real time, I refer you to the [reactions the movie Avatar garnered](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ah43h/reddit_what_did_you_think_of_avatar/) when it [first came out](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/agbba/sure_avatar_is_pocahontas_in_space_and_a_sequel/), compared to the reactions the movie typically gets now that it has become the most successful movie ever - a steady progression from a generally positive but nuanced take to OMG WORST MOVIE EVER.

**THE EMPATHY DEFICIT**

However, this does not quite manage to account for some other notable quirks in the hive, such as the aforementioned contrast between its affinity for gay rights and its disdain for women and minorities.  To explain this, we have to examine the peculiar role that **the empathy deficit** plays in the behavior of the hive.  We all remember that the hive erupted in outrage - and rightly so - at the awful bullying behavior of those middle schoolers to that older lady on the bus, right?  It’s interesting to compare that to the hive’s reaction when a bunch of internet porn viewers start bullying a cam girl – all of a sudden [everything is the girl’s fault](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/xxvs4/i_think_this_linkthread_captures_the_essence_of/).  

What’s going on here?  Note how many of these reactions are determined by who the hive happens to identify with more.  Your average hiveminder has very little understanding of what it's like to be black or a woman, or to suffer the kind of discrimination blacks and women are sadly familiar with. But what about your average young gay male? Well, he's probably a little scrawny, probably has some tics that make him noticeably unusual, probably has unusual interests, probably gets picked on. Your average hiver gets this. Hell, your average hiver probably was picked on for being gay, even if he wasn't. He knows what it's like to be mocked for this and it hurts.

Now, what about the old lady getting picked on in the bus? Well, which side do you think your typically redditor was on in school - the jeering, bullying crowd or the tearful recipient?  But when the bullying crowd is a group of anonymous keyboard warriors saying dickish things over the internet, how interesting that we suddenly have a whole new set of sympathies.

[A lack of empathy is, of course, one of the most noted features of those on the techie side of things.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome).   As a result, the average hiver places maximum priority upon issues with which he can empathize, while disregarding those which involve an unfamiliar form of experience.  The best example of this can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/127bll/truegaming_black_guy_rants_about_what_its_like_to/c6swdc9?context=3), though I also refer you to:

* Jokes about raping men, particularly prison rape, are inevitably met with frowning tut-tuts of how that's not funny.  Jokes about raping [male children](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/yfgcu/really_how_do_you_let_this_headline_through/c5v3ul9), however, are hilarious.

* Girls walking around in public should have little expectation of privacy, and yet Gawker's invasion of violentacrez's privacy results in [sitewide condemnation](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/10/redditors-stand-gawker-protect-child-pornography/57850/).

* An abiding concern that [women are out to get us](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/10vrkd/a_til_post_about_ladies_night_being_banned_brings/).

Note how the only thing which seems to unify these disparate reactions is whoever the hiver tends to immediately identify with most.

Now, the assertion that the hivemind struggles with empathy might seem a bit confusing, even controversial, given the hive’s affinity for leftist politics.  Personally, however, I found that comparing [the hive’s relative reaction to Palestine (most important issue!) and Tibet (omg shut up already!) to be quite telling](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/14of45/if_you_need_any_further_proof_of_the_hollow/), suggesting that what animates the hive is less compassion than the opportunity to take an “unpopular” opinion.  Once again, the prime movers are snowflaking and second-option bias, not bone-bred political convictions.

There is even, I think, a telling shallowness in the embrace of gay rights and a lesson in the limits of empathy which is revealed by the hive’s embrace of the epithet “faggot.”  Being general champions of gay rights, one might expect the hive to reject such terms and their hurtful etymology.  Note, however, that there’s no “second option” in this case, no in-law or journalist to contradict.  No one, not even Republicans, argue in favor of the usage of “faggot,” and as a result there is no one to bravely disagree with.  Furthermore, because of its quasi-meme status, the hiver associates people saying “OP is a fag” with people like him.  The empathy for a gay individual hurt by the normalization of this slur is overridden by empathy towards someone even more like him than a homosexual.  Again, what appears to be the moving piece here is that the hiver's compassion runs out as soon as his empathy does, particularly when there is no second-option to bravely brave against.  

**CONTENT VS. COMMUNITY**

But what about other quirks, such as the tendency to repeat jokes and memes until they are well and thoroughly beaten into the ground?  Moreover, why do such tendencies persist despite such a vocal segment of the community loudly disdaining them?  Here we must distinguish between **content users and community users**.  Content users come to reddit primarily to absorb the information that is produced, whether in jokes, news or serious minded discussion.  The value of the information is limited to its single use absorption.  Community users, on the other hand, are attracted not just by the raw value of the content but also by the need to connect and integrate with what they take to be a community of friends and pseudo-friends.  Community users will repeat a meme far beyond the point at which its inherent comical value has been bled dry because it functions as a symbol of in-group coherence - think of it as like a digital high-five amongst a cohort of people “in the know.”  This is why in-jokes maintain a life far beyond the value of the original joke, as it functions as a reminder of the group’s unique social cohesion.  This is also why content users roll their eyes with utter incredulity as yet another chain of beaten-down references - the joke has long since lost its inherent comic value, but community users are still banding it around because they are extracting a value from it which content users either don’t want or don’t need.

**CASUAL VS COMMITTED**

The final set of concepts necessary to explicate reddit’s behavior is to understand the distinction between **casual users and committed users.**  This distinction is rather more trivial than the others, and should be readily evident to anyone who has glanced into a highly upvoted thread in which all the commenters are baffled by its popularity, but I think it is worth lingering on in order to unpack a few of its implications.  Given the peculiarities of reddit's [alogorithm and its accompanying “fluff principle""](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vqy9y/dear_circlebrokers_what_changes_would_you_make_to/c56x55f), reddit clearly caters to casual users, and from a business perspective this makes a certain amount of sense since unique visitors power a website’s cachet.  However, there is a certain danger in this, as the more bland and watered-down the experience becomes, the more it becomes indistinguishable from others, the easier it is to abandon.  The casual users who are driving certain trends in the quality of content are also liable to the be most likely to move onto the next thing.  Despite everything I’ve written here, I am very much a big fan of reddit at its best, and what reddit can manage to be, but without a robust understanding of the fundamental dynamics at play - what makes them strong, what makes it weak - it runs the risk of being just another thing.

Apparently, these discussions happen quite often, and the only reason this one got leaked is because it revealed two very popular Reddit posters are actually the same person. Anyway, that's for the popcorn crowd.

But the broader implications concern me. You've got a group of mods who are quite chummy with each other, and also with the people who run the site, who are supposed to be (ideally) impartial. Many of these mods run the top subreddits, and because of Reddit's ""mods are gods"" system, are able to control the flow of (and type of) content of most of the site. Digg was utterly ruined by, among other things, the power user model, where to get to the top, you had to be well known, or at least ""in"" with the right people. Say something the ones in charge don't want? Enjoy your trip to obscurity.

Combined with the removal of /r/reddit.com (which was arguably the best place to vent and/or point out abuses of power), and recent moves like the one that [hides who bans users](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/pps1t/moderators_bans_originate_from_the_subreddit_and/), the trend in the past year seems to be toward a centralization of power (and we all know power has a rather unfortunate side-effect of corruption, especially on the Net), reduction of mod accountability, and painting any criticism as ""rabble rousing"" or ""witch hunting"".

Is Reddit going to become as cronyist as Digg? Does the architecture (infinite subreddit making capability for example) prevent or reduce the possibility? Anything ordinary users can do to prevent this?

By the way, the leaked file (posted on Pastebin) was deleted. It was reuploaded, and that too was deleted. And again. A backup was uploaded to Imgur, and that's mysteriously vanished as well. Even on a (relatively) small subreddit as /r/SubredditDrama, someone's watching.

Edit: I was ""requested"" to remove the link to the IRC chat because it supposedly contains personal information. The link was to the SubredditDrama post about it, not the file itself, but fine.

Who's buying Upvotes.,The3rdWorld,458,78,137,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/qrev1/whos_manipulating_reddit_and_how_whos_buying/,"We all know that a lot of people have reason to game Reddit and the social networks -everyone from corporations to the state department - so who's doing it?  what are they pushing?  and how are they working it?  
  
Here's a screen shot of me [hopefully] earning 8 cents from up-voting; 
  
 http://i.imgur.com/65Zhz.png  
  
I was contracted to use an existing account to up-vote this - http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/qqrl0/this_static_image_shakes_weird/ - this is a link to a facebook blogspam image and deserves no upvotes, it's amassed 51 so far but of course my opinion isn't proof.  More interesting are the comments, totally unlike regular Reddit comments in that they're mostly single word positives or meaningless statements -one even says it's a 'very nice picture with flash' which it obviously isn't. 

so following the user names of the posters i noticed very few have made any other comments, other posts they have also posted on;
 
 http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nhyvg/strongest_woman_ever/ - almost as suspect quality of replies, including one from Swordmaster006 'HEY GUYS I'M MAKING MONEY ON REDDIT'  
  
http://www.reddit.com/r/Uganda/comments/qm79t/stop_kony_2012/ - which includes yet more single word positive answers i.e. 'good', 'ok' and 'mhmm' and again someone is claiming to have been paid to upvote, [Upvoted for $0.10.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Uganda/comments/qm79t/stop_kony_2012/c3znbgo) by Hooga.  [User Jaseena](http://www.reddit.com/user/jaseena) has only ever commented on two posts, this and the shaking eye post I was paid to upvote.  
  
Both the posts which Jaseena upvoted were also upvoted by Mugilavan and posted by the user [compucated](http://www.reddit.com/user/compucated) who has made a handful of posts mostly on the same few subjects;  
   
.. 3 - Eye Shaking Youtube mentioned above  
.. 3 - 'Free Palestine? I'll take two' Facebook joke page   
.. 8 - 'Occupy Palestine' (anti-Zionist joke)   
.. 2 - Stop Kony 2012 -visible-children (which was followed by a post one min later in another thread suggesting the same video)  
.. 5 - 'How Communists Celebrate Valentines Day' facebook joke page  
.. 1 - '■■ Bank Revolution - WHO ARE THE 99%? ■■■ (bankrevolution.com)'   
.. 4 - 'Nickname your Breasts! (Breast Cancer Awareness) (nicknamesforbreasts.com)' in which he's posted two genuine sounding comments.  
.. 4 - 'Tribute to Steve Jobs (1955 - 2011) (tribute2stevejobs.com)' in which he's posted 2 genuine sounding comments (identical)  
.. 2 - 'what the fuck has Sarah Palin Done So Far??? (wtfhassarahpalindonesofar.com)' [anti-palin site]  
..  1 'WTF has OBAMA done so far? (wtfhasobamadonesofar.com)' [a pro-obama site] plus one comment request to pass it on to others, and one comment repeating the link (suggesting a new reddit user who didn't entirely understand the system?)  
  
So, to sum up the account is a Palestine supporting democrat that wants you to sign up to facebook pages (most of which are defunct or ill-conceived) - I'm guessing we're not dealing with Hillary C, so what is their game?  
  
The history of this account seems to be someone that's learning how to push ideas onto Reddit, his early posts (bottom of my list) don't fit the space and have no comments or very few comments - with the Kony and Eye Shaking Youtube it seems to be testing out MTurk, neither have more than twenty 'fake' comments so it doesn't seem to have been spectacularly successful.  
  
So, i guess Reddit needs to make sure it's checking to see if everyone upvote/commenting on a post is being referred by the same agency - other than that there seems little Reddit can or really need to do in order counter this.
  
Has anyone else whored out their upvotes? been tempted to pay your way to the front page?  Do you think this seems like a weird ego thing or a failed attempt at riding the social networking gravy train?  Is someone trying to push their own ideas or simply trying to establish accounts and get followers so as to better push bigger and better paid campaigns?

I doubt the general Reddit population noticed my account, but I am surprised it took this long. I was pretty brazen about it because every time I would post, it would appear in /r/risingthreads within the first 10 minutes. I used 10 other accounts to upvote my account and reposted popular links to legitimize my other accounts, but always tried to use OC for my main account. To get around the IP address problem, I used the Anonymox add-on for Firefox and RES and would switch accounts to upvote my posts to +10 so they would be seen on /r/top (this hour) and let reddit do the rest. **This took about 5 minutes.** I've gotten to the frontpage multiple times and even hit the top spot.

I had a pointless mission of getting to the top of popular subreddits just to see if I can. Below are the posts:

And some other small subreddits as well. I've also gotten to the frontpage with my other accounts with popular reposts to legitimize them and it was relatively simple using the same methods.

I've been wanting to make this post for a while, but didn't want my main account to be banned, but this is somewhat freeing. As for now, I'll still visit reddit regularly, but I'll refrain from posting in the forseeable future. Feel free to berate me, say ""fuck you!"", and tell me I am what's wrong with reddit. My only response is: ""meh.""

**EDIT2:** Just for the hell of it and to show that those 10 upvotes in 5 minutes didn't matter, someone could take 5 seconds and just repost any of my past images now or in the future and see if they hit the top of their respective subreddits or the frontpage without cheating. They were successful, but not very memorable. If they do, then this whole post was wrong and I have wasted 25-30 minutes a week for the past year.

1328066645.0,337,self.TheoryOfReddit,p5l1c,Some reflections on how reddit has changed on my 5th birthday here,jjrs,378,41,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/p5l1c/some_reflections_on_how_reddit_has_changed_on_my/,"Just to get it out of the way, this isn't a ""Reddit's changed since the digg morons came, man, it used to be cool""-type post. I still think its great, all things considered. I just realized its my 5th birthday here today, and started reflecting on how things have changed.

I first came here in late 2006 and made an account early 2007. Reddit didn't have any subreddits yet, just one big page. The top submissions would get about 200, 300 net upvotes tops. One of my first submissions got to #2 on the front page with 250 upvotes, and almost no downvotes (this was before ""vote fuzzing""; most top submissions now actually get 5-30k real upvotes). When the admins added the first subreddits and I started seeing subscriber info, there might have been 20,000 subscribers. Basically, it was still very much in the shadow of Digg. But the links were more interesting, and if you submitted a story, it might actually get seen. So I stuck around.

The seed investor Paul Graham and Joel Spolsky had already began to move off, complaining that it was getting full of ""kids"". But it still had the feel of a place mostly populated by programmers. Lots of sciencey, general-interest stories. The comment section was still small enough you got to know most people by name. I remember seeing xkcd as a commenter, and then finding out he did the comic and thinking ""yeah, that sounds about right"": redditors were mostly self-proclaimed geeks in their mid 20's with some interesting hobbies. 

Then Politics seemed to get more and more dominant, and for a while everything was Kucinich, Ron Paul and vote up if you hate Bush. I'm very liberal, but it got pretty monotone after awhile.

Subreddits, and later allowing people to create their own, was an utterly genius move in retrospect, but it took a while for them to catch their individual strides. For a while most of the subreddits outside of r/politics felt like backwaters without much going on (everybody still posted to a generic ""reddit"" subreddit). But of course, that changed. Alexis and Spez (the founders) wanted make-your-own dubreddits because they were fully committed to the self-creating community concept. I believe it was this that allowed reddit to thrive even after they left. Some of the biggest subreddits now are about stuff that never would have occurred to central management.

Eventually, and probably especially after the subreddits gained traction, a split was created between people that viewed reddit as a *tool* and people that viewed it as a *community*. The ""tool"" people just used it like you would use BitTorrent for links, and didn't have as much stake in what other users thought (or at least not much more than what diggers did, if they even bothered reading comments at all). The ""community"" people saw the comments as the main show. They wanted the acceptance of others here. At the time, that was a bit of a novel concept (initially, r/circlejerk started as a bit of a parody of the tearfully happy, ""guys, we're a *community!*"" mindstate).

""Self"" posts became popular before it was even possible to add text; people would just put a message in the link itself. This led to a lot of upvotes of one-liners (""Vote up if you think Bush should go to jail""). The mods hated it because it seemed like reddit would inbreed, as far as they were concerned, the point of the site was to find links from the outside. So they announced no karma would be given for self posts.

The community responded by upvoting self posts more than ever. Today there are enormous self-post subreddits like Askreddit and IAMA that get several times more traffic than the original reddit ever got.

The comment section got better and better. The upvote system saw to it that only the wittiest (or most informed) comments would reach the top, and that in term only the wittiest and sharpest replies would rise. The end result was conversations that seemed as if 100 writers had sat there trying to think of the perfect line for each end of the exchange. Because actually, there had been. I think the comment section is one of the best features of the site. When I see a story elsewhere on the net that I'm wondering about, I click the ""submit"" button on my browser just to get lead to the existing reddit thread, where inevitably someone with some expertise on the subject has chimed in to add detail.

People began lobbying for ""comment karma"", which was granted. Eventually, celebrity redditors emerged known only for their comments, not external links.

When McGrim made a post to announce that he had made a free, easy to use image hosting service (Imgur), it hit #1 on the front page. Until then, user-generated content had been frowned on because it was potentially ""blogspam"". Since with imgur you could link to an image with no ads, users could prove they had no ulterior motives posting stuff. It quickly became the site standard, and eventually user-generated content became much more common.

Stuff from 4chan became popular, and the joke was that what was on 4chan yesterday winds up on reddit today. I know that's still true to an extent, but reddit seems to have made ragecomics a thing of their own, even if most of the original faces came from elsewhere. Still, a lot of the user-made stuff seemed (and still does) derivative and done for attention.

Eventually the frontpage got full of a lot of stuff that just wasn't very interesting IMO. I unsubscribed from pics, funny, wtf, etc and just stuck to stuff like math and philosophy of science and todayIlearned. In my opinion if you filter reddit that way, its as good as ever. But doing that secluded me from the mainstream front page for a long time. I've introduced a lot of friends to reddit, but when we talk about it we often talk about stories the other hasn't seen because its all in different niche subreddits.

Recently, I hit on ""all"" to see the ""real"" front page, and it was like coming back to a village you once lived in only to find its a city, with different communities in every borough. Subreddits like r/trees and r/Ffffuuuu now have more subscribers than the original reddit had, total, and they look, feel and behave completely differently. There's a lot more /self posts (entire subreddits of them, like this one), and a lot more user-generated content and memes. It has its own identity now, rather than just a bookmark system for aggregating stories from other websites.

The most surprising thing is how influential reddit has became. It blew my mind to see the New York Times take reddit seriously as an agent of internet activism when it covered SOPA. Internet forums always seem to have an inflated sense of importance, so its very surprising seeing it make a transition to something that's actually on the radar, and can now influence the news events it links to stories about. It's like watching the fourth wall break down. 

In a way, I see those successes as the final victory of the ""community"" faction of redditors over the original ""tool"" link exchangers: they proved that the site really could (and perhaps even should) be more than a link aggregator. I admit that as an old-timer I was skeptical anything would come of it; it seemed like armchair internet activism that just gave an illusion of effectiveness. But in light of things like the SOPA resistance, it's becoming clearer people like me were wrong.

So anyway, welcome to everyone who's come since.

Edit: added some more details, since people seem interested.

Edit 2: People have been asking me if I think reddit is better or worse now. I think there's more of *everything*, period. More memes, more jokes, more circlejerking..but also more good stuff. 

As examples of good stuff we have now that we didn't have then (for me and my own experience, anyway)...r/science has people with actual credentials serving as mods, and r/statistics is much larger and more informative than it ever could have been a few years ago. Somebody even started an r/academicpublishing, which now has over 1000 subscribers and got an IAMA...AMA from an editor at Springer. I just found out that an all-girl korean pop group has an active subreddit now. Not my thing personally, but when you find your equivalent infatuation its amazing. That kind of specialization simply wasn't possible on the old reddit. Just not enough people. So in short, anything you want is there, and you'll see whatever you focus on.

In small subreddits the best posts can get only a few dozens of upvotes, while in the large subreddits the number of upvotes are in the hundreds. A good article in a small subreddit can get just as many votes as an average article in a big subreddit. And because they mix up with each other on the front page, I found myself not necessarily reading posts with less than a few dozen upvotes, because I've been conditioned to think they are lesser quality. This is - of course - because I look at karma and not the title of the article, but it seemed to be a reflex, not a conscious choice. So I decided to make a script that hides the karma. It has fixed the problem for me and I read posts because of their title instead of just their karmascore.

This simple greasemonkey/tampermonkey script hides all the karma, even with RES. While it's not a new idea, I didn't find any scripts that would already do this, especially with RES, so I made my own. It would be interesting to hear how others find this.

I truly hope that this is not an extremely controversial change. In every other subreddit I moderate, this is an unwritten rule. However, we don't really like unwritten rules around here ;)

Edit: I'd like to mention that we have an internal policy that will be extremely relevant here. If three or more mods object to the way a rule is being enforced by another moderator, they can collectively reverse the decision. Since we do have that policy in place, I'm fairly confident that this rule will only be enforced in clear-cut violations such as usernames like ""FattytheFaggot"" or ""NiggerJew666,"" and not, as one user suggested, ""LeMonkeyFace.""

My rough draft received an A from my professor but I'd like to hear some feedback from people who are more familiar with Reddit. 

The basic format of the paper is an introduction discussing the rise of participatory media online (Jay Rosen's ""The People Formerly Known as the Audience), followed by a literature review discussing community, identity, framing, and the digital divide. After that I move on to my analysis which looks at the fetishization of science and rationality, political polarization, misogyny, racism, and the potential for positive action. I end with a short conclusion discussing the implications of my study. 

Title: Discursive Communities on Reddit.com's Default Subreddits: Framing Hegemonic Discourse online. 

Abstract:  This paper focuses on the website Reddit.com and how the selection of default subreddits is a framing process by which a distinctive discursive community is formed. The emphasis on science and technology, as well as the construction of a collective identity which emphasizes characteristics of a white, first world, tech savvy, and politically liberal male contribute to a hegemonic discourse characterized by a fetishization of science and technology as well as tendencies towards racism and misogyny. Despite this, the format of Reddit allows it to be democratic in a way that other media sources cannot, ensuring that it is still overall capable of positive change.

Each week, an individual /r/TheoryOfReddit moderator will host a discussion about a theoretical change to reddit's code, infrastructure or official policy that would not be possible for users and moderators to accomplish alone; it would require admin intervention.

This week's topic:

###What if moderators had the ability to 'turn off' karma in their subreddits?

Karma has been causing problems on reddit for quite some time. Just over five years ago, on June 26th, 2008, [the reddit admins removed karma from self posts.](http://www.reddit.com/comments/6p5ef/sorry_karmawhores_no_more_karma_for_selfposts/) The blog entry has since been removed, but at the time I remember posts such as ""[Vote up if you love Obama](http://www.reddit.com/r/obama/comments/7b831/vote_up_when_you_officially_voted_for_barack/)"" were regularly on the front page of /r/all. Users were submitting what was then the absolutely lowest common denominator content: a simple self post that most redditors would likely agree with and instinctively upvote. They were farming karma and lowering the quality of the front page at the same time, and the problem had progressed to the point where the admins felt that they had to intervene. It didn't stop the problem entirely, but it did remove the karma incentive.

What if moderators could remove the karma incentive from *all* submissions in their subreddits, links and self posts alike? What if you could choose specific categories of submissions, and grant karma to certain categories while excluding it from others (for example, removing karma from direct image submissions but allowing it for all other types of link submissions)? Are you a moderator who would use such a feature in your subreddit(s)? Are you a user who thinks such a feature would be beneficial in a subreddit to which you currently subscribe?

Please tell us why you think so!

So, I was checking r/all and came across [**this post**](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/wtpkr/what_does_the_highest_paid_wnba_player_make/). Reading the comments, I noticed that multiple users blamed [SRS](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/) for the general trend of votes in the thread (supportive comments being downvoted, indicting comments being upvoted). However, as I scrolled down further, I didn't see the customary ""You've been linked in SRS"" comment, and after venturing there to check, it turns out that It hadn't even been submitted. SRS was being blamed, even though they weren't there.

It would appear that SRS has become such a boogeyman that simply invoking their name is seen as a ""free pass"" to explain away downvotes. SRS is so universally despised amongst the general population of Reddit (and the defaults especially) that being hated by them has become a sort of badge of honor, therefore if you manage to draw their attention, you must be doing something right! The way the Reddit culture works, this means that people will actively try to troll SRS by posting and upvoting content that draws their attention. SRS continues to do their thing, and since everything SRS hates is now something to be encouraged, this creates an accelerating cycle of bigoted content that is meant to be humorous. At some point, as previously mentioned, it became irrelevant whether they actually take a notice of you or not. Thus, we now have a self-perpetuating, accelerating cycle. A ""Shitlord Cycle"", if I may borrow some parlance from SRS.

Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal. Trolling has been happening on the internet forever, after all. The problem is, the way you ""troll"" SRS is by posting racist, misogynistic, or homophobic content under the guise of ""humor"". For the redditor in-the-know who doesn't find humor in such content, it can be annoying, at best. **But, for an outsider of the same mindset, it gives the appearance that Reddit is a site full of bigoted content, receiving tons of approval from a bigoted community.** When these people happen to be reporters, SRS is more than happy to [step up and offer a quote or two to confirm the impression](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXGs_7Yted8). Many, many people have written about Reddit's ""growing misogyny problem"" of late in the past year or so, and I believe this phenomenon could be a big part of that. SRS as we know it has been operating [for about a year now](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/j94lu/request_only_mod_of_rshitredditsays_is_idle/).

Now, question time:

1. What do we do about this? The massive increase in popularity of /r/ImGoingToHellForThis might have helped to relegate such content into it's own little corner off the front page, but it's also seems to be a furnace for stoking the creation of more of the same.

2. Is this something that even needs to be dealt with? Should we worry ourselves with the concerns of such critics?

3. What are some other, possible more important causes of this problem that I've overlooked? Situations like this are rarely as simple as I've made it seem in this post, so what did I miss?

*DISCLAIMER: I want to make it clear that I don't really blame SRS for this problem. They were involved, and share some of the blame for the way they behave, but those who perpetuate the content (""immature, bored middle-schoolers"", as I refer to them in the title) are really the guilty party in this.*",,False,,t5_2rtff,1342764195.0,,,True,t3_wuzu2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/wuzu2/the_shitlord_cycle_how_bored_immature/,

From things to constant Colby namedropping in unrelated threads (to almost meme-levels of horse-beatery) to Mitt Romney spam and the massively overused AskReddit thread title format ([dumb story creating sensationalist title] | [vaguely related question]), I'm finding it hard to enjoy this place when it feels at times that the general quality has been dropping considerably recently.

Perhaps it's ironic that I'm mentioning circlejerk of all places as a way to combat karma-whoring, but I've noticed recently that the content it pokes fun of again and again are related to the habits that need to die. True, the community there has something to say about everything, but some things get mentioned a lot more than others, and that's not a coincidence.

Current topics there right now:

* Colby Colby Colby Colby Colby Colby - which is actually a decent mirror of AskReddit right now. My favourite title there at the moment is ""UPDATE: I need more karma for Colby.""
* ""Lonely teenagers of reddit, what should I do about my failing marriage?"" - regarding the fact that people post these questions to AskReddit for attention instead of posting them to a much more smaller and relevant subreddit with a better chance of a positive solution, or even a more suitable website altogether
* Beer cans on things, ""Stacking Saturday"". - Someone does something, sees it generating karma, and then everyone else beats the concept in the ground by flooding the same places with the same content about it
* """"Why Is The Muslim World So Easily Offended?"" / Don't read the article, just upvote and post your answer to the question in a comment, as if somebody asked you."" - dumb redditors in karmawhoring overdrive, disregarding thread rules just to get their unnecessary opinion on the board first
* ""DAE want to swallow Louis C.K's load"" - he's a fantastic comedian, but reddit, shut the everliving fuck up about him.
* ""LOOK AT MY USERNAME! HAHAHAHA NAILED IT"" - post by BUTT_HOLE_FUCKER - similar to dumb non-content like ""oh that means a lot, coming from ANAL_RAPER"". Stop mentioning usernames, it's dumb.

Posts are tinged with other little annoying things reddit does - some of it is outdated (such as ""LE LE LE LE"") but some of it is still relevant (""Upboats to you, good sir!""). Perhaps it's a sad indication of where my experience here has wound up, but I find myself agreeing with a lot more posts there than any other subreddit I'm currently subscribed to.

---------------------------------------------------------

A while back, entirely for fun, I mocked up a little [subreddit discovery tree](http://i.imgur.com/IJmtV.png) and posted it on /r/Design. While this was, by no means, a perfect solution to subreddit discovery, it was still a fun exercise in trying to think of ways to help users discover new content on reddit.

Yesterday, after reading that [awesome top-200 subs post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1f7hqc/the_200_most_active_subreddits_categorized_by/) by /u/douglasmacarthur, it reminded me of how much fun it was to create that mockup, and I thought that the ToR community might also have fun doing the same thing.

Not to mention, the more ideas we get from the community, the better we understand what you guys want and how you want to use the site. It's a win-win, in my opinion.

Now I'd like to be perfectly clear, here: **This is not at all a guaranty of change or future implementation on the site.** The entire point of this contest is to gather feedback, and hopefully let you guys have some fun stretching your creativity muscles. So here are the contest details:


* Make a visual design of how YOU would tackle the issue of subreddit discovery
* Optionally document how your design would work, how it would help, etc.
* The design ideally should be something that could exist on reddit - so, not like a 3rd-party site or app
* You don't need to actually code anything. You can simple mock something up in Photoshop. But however deep you want to go with this is totally up to you.
* Submissions will be in Contest Mode, so you won't be able to see the scores at first. But please vote on the ones you like the most!
* We'll close the contest in about a week (and change from Contest Mode so you can see the results).
* **All parent-level replies in this thread should be contest submissions!** If you'd like to discuss this contest, please use [**THIS THREAD**](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1fcvbo/subreddit_discovery_contest_discussion_thread/)

Everyone who submits a legitimate design will get a free [month of reddit gold](http://www.reddit.com/gold/about/) just for participating. And whoever's design is the most-upvoted will get 6 months of reddit gold for free.

Again, keep in mind that the winner's design will not be implemented on the site, or anything. This is just an exercise in feedback and creativity. And, more than that, I just feel like it'd be fun for some of you guys. That's not to say we won't use some of your ideas in the future, but that's not the goal here.

And did you then get a mixed bag of upvotes, downvotes, and a community that misses the point and latches onto the one mistake you made in paragraph eight, sentence four instead? And nobody discusses your idea because nobody's seen it, because nobody's upvoted it, because nobody upvotes self posts?

/r/zelda is a poor subreddit. There's a couple of external factors - huge popularity means a high number of subscribers, and slow turnaround of releases means there's not much to speculate about or look forward to. Most Zelda fans don't play the game every day. Most of our subscribers probably aren't playing a Zelda game right now, haven't played one since Skyward Sword came out in 2011 and won't play one until a new one in 2014 at the earliest.

So we're faced with a subreddit of fan art and pictures of merchandise. On the rare post that is actually about the game series, it's usually a variation on a popular opinion.

We tried two text-only weeks (and we're going to try another next month). The first was good, the second was pretty average. It's a problem with self posts. For some reason they don't get upvotes, so people don't see them.

But yesterday we did day one of a theme week and it transformed the subreddit in hours. **The quality of the posts was very poor** - I encouraged it with the first one, it was just a screenshot with the title ""My favourite part of Skyward Sword"" but it was simple to understand, got some upvotes, made the top submission and the comments started pouring in. Really interesting comments. Comments that weren't afraid to disagree. Comments that didn't have a minor flaw to pick out.

And then more posts following the same format - we've themed each day of this week on a different broad categories on Skyward Sword - and they're just more screenshots and artwork - but they're actually about the game and they're generating discussion about the games and for the first time in a long, long time, /r/zelda is a good subreddit.

**The comments could still be more intelligent. The post quality is dreadful. But the community is reinvigorated.**

There are problems - it's a LOT of moderation removing posts that didn't fit the theme; there was some minor backlash from people who didn't get the memo (it's been announced since the end of December in the header and sidebar) and eventually the conversation will run out. We plan to do this every other month with a different game - any more and we'd exhaust the topics.

A community like /r/zelda is impossible to save without tearing it from the Reddit platform, but this experiment was wonderful.

New mod jij has changed the CSS over in /r/atheism to make five different submission links based on popular /r/atheism submission types.

* Submit Rage Comic (/r/aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm)
* Submit Facebook Chat (/r/TheFacebookDelusion)
* Submit Meme (/r/AdviceAtheists)
* Submit LGBT Related (/r/lgbt/)
* Submit Anything Else (/r/atheism)

Now there's nothing stopping anyone from continuing to post everything into the 'Submit Anything Else' category, and there's been no mod post talking about enforcing this new layout, but this is probably the biggest change to /r/atheism since it started. If anything it will be an interesting experiment, and hopefully leads to positive change over the growing discontent towards /r/atheism.

People would write ""so brave"" or mention ""SRS"" with the implication that we should all clearly know what they meant. I had no clue.

Of course, I would google terms and eventually figure them out, but I think it would be nice to have all the terms compiled and explained by redditors themselves. I've never found a (anywhere near) complete glossary anywhere.

(Also, I like glossaries.)

What are terms that you found obscure that you now understand? Or even terms you don't fully understand and hope to have others explain?

I'll edit this list as we go to try to get as full a glossary as we can. I am spit-balling most of these, so if you can refine or replace any of these descriptions please shoot!

***Here’s what we have so far:***

***Alt*** - Alternative user account.

***AMA*** - Ask me anything. Also a subreddit.

***AMAA*** - Ask me almost anything

***Benned*** - A perversion of the word ""banned"" used by SRS mods. see ""SRS""

***Brave*** or ***So Brave*** - A sarcastic expression used to dismiss a comment or patronize someone for falling in line with popular opinions.

***Brony*** - A fan of My Little Pony.

***Came here to say this.*** - Indicates someone else in the thread said something you wanted to say, whether a joke, a reference, or an observation. Often downvoted.

***Circlejerk*** - A group of people with similar beliefs that self-validate each other, suppress opposing opinions, do not consider that alternate opinions exist, or consider themselves, their opinion, or their group exclusive/superior. Derivatives: /r/circlejerk: a parody subreddit that considers the majority of Reddit a circlejerk. Circlejerker(s): someone (or a group) from /r/circlejerk, or less commonly, a group that is a circlejerk.

***Ctrl-F*** - Indicates that the user was searching for this specific reference in a thread. 

***DAE*** - Does Anyone Else - An appeal to a common feeling/situation/dilemma.

***Defaults*** - The twenty subreddits that appear on the Front Page to users who are not logged in. Reddit users are automatically subscribed when they create a new account. These subreddits are chosen by having the highest activity on reddit.

***EDIT*** - Indicates someone has changed their comment after first posting it. Usually followed by additional text, responses to subsequent comments, or explanations of why they edited their comment and what they changed.

***ELI5*** - Explain like I'm 5 (years old) - A request to explain something in simple terms (also a subreddit).

***Ent*** - Pot smoker. The term originally comes from the the giant walking trees in Lord Of The Rings (Trees mean pot).

***F7U12*** - Shorthand for FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU. May also refer to a popular subreddit focused on rage-comics.

***Fap*** – Masturbate. An onomatopoeia.

***IAMA*** - I Am A - Also a subreddit.

***Karma*** - The point system Reddit uses. Usually completely meaningless, as one only has to agree with a popular opinion to gain it.

***Karmawhore*** - A pejorative term for someone who reposts links (especially if they do it often), or posts links which pander to reddit hivemind voting patterns in an effort to gain internet points. May also refer to a user who comments extremely frequently or in a pandering way (also for internet points).

***Meta-subs*** or ***meta-reddits*** - Subreddits oriented around talking about reddit itself. Subreddit content comes primarily (or exclusively) from www.reddit.com.

***MIC*** - More in comments.

***Mod*** - Moderator of a subreddit. They have the power to remove comments and posts, among other things.

***MRA*** - Men's Rights Activists - Men who feel feminism has gone too far, often expressing a fear of being falsely accused of rape or dissatisfaction with the current family law system. MRA is polarizing: at best viewed as logically minded egalitarians; at worst viewed as misogynists and rape apologists.

***Neckbeard*** - A derogatory term used to describe the prototypical reddit user. Term comes from the percieved poor hygiene of redditors, and failure to shave the facial hair off of their necks for weeks and months at a time. generally someone is called a neckbeard when they (hypocritically) judge other people for their faults, but do not see any faults of their own.

***Ninjaedit*** - Refers to the asterisk that indicates edited comments. If a comment is edited quickly enough after submission, the asterisk will not appear, removing any evidence that an edit ever happened, thus ""ninjaedit"". May also refer to comments that provide no indication that they were edited, despite the presence of an asterisk. These comments are looked down upon because they can make threads confusing to read.

***Power user*** - A user with a high comment karma score whose username is recognizable to a large group of people on reddit. Often very frequent posters and may be karmawhores.

***Pun thread*** - A series of comments that make puns (often of lesser and lesser quality) that are related to a theme of the original post.


***Reddit switcharoo*** - An old comedy method and trope on reddit, in which users will often facetiously put forward an interpretation of the original post that is coherent, but not intended, e.g. switching two elements in the post. example: someone posts a picture of a dog licking a person's face with the caption ""I wasn't expecting that"". The ""switcharoo"" might be someone commenting that ""They also weren't expecting the human to react that way.""

***Reddiquette*** - Refers to the rules of Reddit, the rules of a specific subreddit, or less commonly to unwritten guidelines of conduct followed by typical Redditors.

***Relevant username*** - Used when a comment has a coincidental relation to the name of the account that posted it.

***Repost*** - Posting an image or link that has already appeared on reddit for a second (or more) time in an attempt to gain internet points. Usually comes up when the previous post was recent and well-received. The word repost is generally used to denote disapproval, and often sets off a debate on the validity of reposting in the context of user-voting (ie if reposted content is upvoted then people want to see it).

***RES*** - ""Reddit Enhancement Suite"" - A browser addon dedicated to improve the reddit experience.

***RTFA*** - Read the fucking article.

***Shadow-ban*** - A site-wide ban on a user that the user is not notified of. This is usually the result of breaking reddit's rules. The user is unaware of the ban because their posts will still show up for them, but nobody else will see the user's activity.

***Shitpost*** - A post that lacks any real value. Usually ascribed to circlejerk posts or posts that are overly stupid, boring, sensationalistic, or lame.

***Sockpuppet*** - Reddit specific definition: An alternate account (see ""alt"") used by a redditor to speak in a voice other than that of the creator's recognized user name. Sockpuppets differ from ordinary alts in that they may be used to express controversial or negative opinions, rant, or troll. In some cases, a sockpuppet may be shared amongst a group of users, for such purposes as moderation, vote brigading or trolling. All alt's are not sockpuppets, but all sockpuppets are alts. A sockpuppet is basically a straw man.

***SRD*** - Subreddit drama. Usually refers to the subreddit, /r/subredditdrama, but can also (very rarely) refer to the actual drama its self.

***SRS*** - Shit Reddit Says - A sub-Reddit that catalogues racist/sexist/ableist ect comments from other sub-Reddits and links to them. SRS is polarizing: at best viewed as pointing out statements of bigotry and privilege; at worst, as an unofficial downvote brigade that can't appreciate a joke.


***Sub*** - An individual subreddit.

***That's the joke*** or ***thatsthejoke.jpg*** - Indicates a commenter has just pointed out the humor in a joke, especially if the source of the humor is obvious.

***THIS*** - Indicates you agree with or want to draw attention to a comment. Often downvoted.

***TIL*** - Today, I learned...

***TL;DR*** - Too Long; Didn't Read - After a wall of text a commenter may include a shorter description of what they wrote about, sometimes humourously. Also sometimes inserted by another commentator to explain an article or previous comment.

People go ballistic sometimes.

I used to think to myself: *Jesus, it's karma. Who cares?*

But I think it goes deeper than that. Reddit is a big collection of micro-communities, partially (via defaults) a macro-community. Karma is a form of social validation - the clever or well-timed joke, the insightful comment, the expert opinion, you name it. It increases your social esteem, even in a relatively anonymous context. And social maneuvering is *what humans do*. People spend *fortunes* in very-real-dollars trying to achieve certain levels of social recognition, respect, whatever in the real world - why shouldn't people chase after recognition here?

We're rewarding each other for things that are socially celebrated offline, and weirdly, on reddit, there's actually a quantitative measure of it. You get a number.

(Is there a counterpart in real life? Salary? Facebook friends?)

If you've ever had a really successful post or comment, even in a small subreddit, you get a kind of rush watching the upvotes pour in. Even more so if the content is something you're proud of. It *matters*.

When I imagine a world where all humans are blind, yet try to invent sight, I sense an impossibility.

Then Digg went bad, everybody came over here, and I largely forgot about Digg.

But since Digg sold out last year, stopped trying to be a user-generated voting site, stopped pretending that opinions and comments mattered, and just started promoting articles, I find myself adding more and more of its links to my Reading List. Good links, to reputable sources like The Atlantic, The Guardian, Popular Science, Wired, GQ, XKCD, The New York Times, The New Yorker. You know...articles, for reading.

By contrast, 14/25 of the front page links on reddit are self-posts or imgur images. I still look at them, but they aren't really relevant to my life; they don't enhance my view of the world in the slightest.

I'm not a shill, just a long-time redditor who's seen both sites change a lot over the years, and I'm starting to lean back towards curated content because reddit is just so bland these days--all pictures and no depth. The voting algorithm prioritizes 10 second experiences and quick upvotes over substance.

What do you guys think?

**Edit:** I'm getting a lot of feedback on AskReddit that the key to reddit is customizing, choosing the right subreddits.  That's fine for the dedicated user, but what about casual users like me who rarely bother to log in at all.  How do we make the default better?  I bet a lot of you customized subreddit subscribers are looking for the same kind of things, and new users judge Reddit based on the default front page.  I believe we can do better if we start offering new and casual users something better from the start.  There was a golden time, like mid-2007, 2008, when I didn't even think about customizing, because all the links were awesome, interesting videos and scientific articles--real good stuff nerdy people posted because that's what they were reading.

A post on /r/Guildwars2 claimed to have found an in-game crafting recipe which has a high probability of creating a rare item (6/11 times success according to his post). He used this (apparently edited) video to back up his claims: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9VHImqIMYQ

The post was quite highly voted, until people started losing a lot of in-game money and calling it a scam.

It looks like he managed to run a successful [pump and dump](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_and_dump) scam, driving up the prices on the in-game trading post/auction house.

Other categories: current events, science, entertainment, gave me a steady stream of interesting new content (with the exception of visual art, which had it's own problems) but all my attempts to use Reddit to discover new music, or even older interesting music were a waste of time.

I think a few things may be happening: 

* there's a natural sentimental component to the songs people choose to link to–stuff they listened to in college or high school, etc.

* people aren't listening to or voting on songs they don't recognize and have already heard, or worse yet downvoting all songs or bands they aren't familiar with

* in larger subreddits, the emotional connection to the songs that *they* post may be causing some to downvote everything that isn't their song.  It's likely not exclusive to r/Music but anyone who's ever tried posting there has probably had the experience of having their post downvoted in less time than it takes to listen to the intro, whether or not it's ever been posted to Reddit.

* Reddit as a community simply may not be ideal for curating art of any kind.  My same attempts at scraping Tumblr were far more successful when it came to art and music.  

Before trying this I expected that Reddit would be the best source for crowdsourced music because of it's voting system and diverse categories but it failed miserably.  I thought about expanding it to consider the date the source was posted along with the number of views/likes but because of the overall low quality of the posts I've abandoned Reddit and am using Tumblr for everything arts-related.

I know the definition of good music is subjective so I'm interested in getting other opinions: is Reddit useful for music discovery and if not, why not?  Can it be fixed?

Or maybe this provides the template for many more people to karma whore and inevitably force Reddit's hand to improve in order to compete with more evolved competitor sites.  Whatever the case may be, I don't hate karma whores, but I do think they need to be downvoted.

Of late, I'd estimate 75% of the responses to my comments were a variation of either ""You seem to give a lot of fucks"" or ""When are you going to come out as andrewsmith1986"".  The comments should be insightful and thought provoking, and not something a 10 year old could post.   A lot of people will tell me ""Go to the smaller subreddits"".  But this is just a branch of reddit, and a lot of what goes on in the default subreddits spills over into the smaller ones that do not have good moderation.  Reddit as a whole needs to change, and I think that it has the potential to really be the best site on the internet.

**How I got started being a karma whore** - I lurked on digg since 2008 and reddit since the mass digg exodus.  I remember over a year ago when I wrote a long, thoughtful responses that got buried.  I instantly realized it wasn't worth it to spend all that time writing a post for the slim chance that it would get upvoted to the top.  So I continued to lurk on reddit for the next 2 years or so.

It was only until recently that I became an active user, with my main goal being to promote my subreddit.  I started with my first username /u/r-howtonotgiveafuck and got really lucky because my first comments got a lot of upvotes.  For the next couple of weeks, Reddit was like a drug and I tried every possible strategy to maximize karma.  It was also a lot of fun because for me it was also an exercise in creativity where I would constantly try and churn out witty 1-liners as quickly as possible.  I knew I hit it big when I got the top comment on this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/skeh8/taco_bell_on_420/).  From that point on, I decided to focus on promoting my subreddit and spending as little time as possible to do it.

I decided to transition to the more visible username r_HOWTONOTGIVEAFUCK and pretty much mastered the game (not trying to be pompous here).  During this period about 90% of my comments were posted during the hours of 9-5 on weekdays (when I work).  In 3 weeks, I acquired 43k karma and didn't waste my life away like Trapped_In_Reddit (I love you buddy and I know you are reading this ;)  See [here](http://metareddit.com/stalk?user=r_howtonotgiveafuck) for my average upvotes/comment.  It is significantly higher than any other karma whore.

Now at this point I don't see much purpose to posting in bulk.  For a short while it was pretty cool to be a ""celebrity"" and have other redditors recognize me by name.  But the thrill of this dies quickly.  And rather than acquiring worthless karma points, I was trying to get more people to find a subreddit that has a bunch of excellent members that try to help one another out.  And I think my mission was successful - /r/howtonotgiveafuck just reached the 10k mark in a little over 2 months.  

So you probably won't see me as much in the default subs any longer.  I may show up every now and then, but I think I'll stick to the more thought provoking and discussion oriented subreddits like this one, /r/TrueReddit, /r/DepthHub, and also the community oriented ones like the reddit exchanges.

**I submit Comment Karmawhoring 101 - Guide to racking up worthless internet points**

1. Try to stay in the large subreddits, especially /r/pics, /r/funny, and /r/AskReddit - These subreddits have a lot of subscribers, lots of upvotes, and lots of new posts that are available for commenting.  Other large subreddits such as /r/politics or /r/science are also an option, but sometimes commenters are looking for more of an in depth and insightful response.  They also don't have nearly as many posts as /r/pics or /r/funny. 

2. Go to your subreddit of preference and stay in the what's hot page - Scroll down the page until you see [a post without a score](http://imgur.com/D2Uws).  This means the post is fresh (within 2 hours), and ripe to move up the charts. Comment on this post.  Set an [alarm](http://e.ggtimer.com/20minutes) and refresh the what's hot page every 20 minutes so that you can comment on another fresh post.

3. Commenting on a post rarely works, because you are competing with so many other responses.  The better way is to reply to the top post. This way, your comment will almost always be seen. **TIP**: Try and gauge which response will end up at the top.  If top comment has 10 upvotes in 1 hour and 2nd comment has 8 upvotes in 10 minutes, you can be pretty sure 2nd comment will eventually hit the top.  Reply to 2nd comment.

4. Continue the conversation - Continue the train of thought from the preceding comment.  Also, whatever immediately comes to your mind after reading the comment is what you should probably write about.  Remember, you are karmawhoring, you do not have time to think out the perfect response.  If you try to think too hard, it will probably be a bad comment.

5. The comment MUST fall under one of these categories - witty/funny, interesting (personal story or trivia), thought provoking, expresses gratitude towards someone or something.  Keep in mind, witty/funny works the best, by far.

6. Understand the Reddit audience - They are left-wing idealists for the most part.  Don't criticize their beliefs.  Inside jokes work extremely well.  Always stay positive and if you must criticize, don't do it too harshly.

7. Keep your comment short - Everyone who enters the comment section is willing to read a 1 liner, but not everyone is willing to read 2 paragraphs.

8. Use bold or ALL CAPS.  If you know you have a gold comment, use this technique.  It makes your comment more visible for upvotes.  **BEWARE**: Do not use this strategy often.  Redditors do not like it if you are an attention whore.  Also, if your comment is only average, you will be downvoted strongly.

9. Use an image or GIF to explain what you can in words - **Reddit prefers looking at pictures over reading.**  This is probably the most important tip I can give you.  **NOTE**: Meme's work well also, but be careful, it is a thin line between a popular meme and an overused one.

10. How do you find a gif or image? - Easy. Think of a keyword that matches the comment you are responding to and do a quick search on /r/reactiongifs or /r/gifs. [Example](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/tumjj/dont_bring_a_girl_to_the_nba_finals_shell_just/c4pvb8d?context=3).
**PROTIP**: Reaction gifs are gold.  Keep a list or folder for quick, easy access.

11. 2nd option - Find an image using [google images](http://images.google.com/).  Just type in the keyword that matches the comment you are responding to and add ""funny"" to the end.  You will most likely find something that redditors will gladly upvote. Example [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tqmin/adult_swim_just_announced_that_toonami_is/c4owd7z?context=3) (Search google images for ""samurai jack funny"" and look at page 2 for exact image I used)

12. Look for opportunities to respond to people who have replied to you.  Karma trains are your friend.  Ride them till the end.  **NOTE**: If someone criticizes your posts, do not respond.  The hivemind will kill you.  Haters gonna hate.

13. Something I never did but works for a lot of other redditors ([I won't mention names](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t8p92/i_emailed_a_teacher_to_say_thank_you_and_he/c4khzug?context=3)) - Exaggerate or completely make up anything related to you - personal anecdotes, preferences, etc..  No one will know the difference.

14. Remember, a lot of your comments will be hit or miss.  As you continue to karmawhore, check your progress.  See which comments were downvoted and which were upvoted.  You will slowly get a better understanding of what works and what doesn't.  Also, compare your responses to competing responses.",,False,,t5_2rtff,1337698088.0,,,True,t3_tx4mz,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/tx4mz/comment_karmawhoring_101_guide_to_racking_up/,

uneditreddit is a browser plugin that allows you to see deleted comments. it's gotten some [uptake recently](http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/16ltra/ysk_about_unedditreddit_a_site_that_allows_you_to/), see also this [karmacourt sumbission](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/15flm6/may_it_please_the_court_i_present_a_new_evidence/) by /u/unedditreddit. it's not immediately clear to me if this plugin is affiliated with the old unedditreddit, a non-plugin centralized version which was asked to shut down by admin over two years ago; /u/raldi comments on [the why here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/etd52/lets_have_a_discussion_about_deleted_comments/c1as392).

these abstract concerns aside, and unlike that centralized version, the new plugin-based solution is ostensibly user-powered, its data assembled by uploading and redistributing the comments seen by its users. this gives it an ability the centralized version never had: peeking into the private subreddits frequented by its users. additionally, reddit itself has far fewer options in addressing this kind of approach, which does not directly obtain any information from reddit servers.

of course, RES (for example) *could* be doing this too. incidentally, /u/honestbleeps has [declined to implement unedit functionality](http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/17ekxu/was_an_uneditreddit_feature_implemented_if_so_how/c854f1w) in a [recent discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/17ekxu/was_an_uneditreddit_feature_implemented_if_so_how/), citing controversy. debatably, by failing to respect these concerns, unedditreddit should be seen as suspect. less debatably, **unedditreddit betrays a certain level of ideological involvement by using [a screenshot of /r/SRSWomen on their download page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unedditreddit/ppgcnpiddlbiemncalhbpgkcgecfofpj)** ; see today's [SRSMeta discussion here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSMeta/comments/18c7l3/is_unedditreddit_safe_to_use/).

personally i think this makes it reasonable to conclude that **unedditreddit is probably maybe being used to obtain surreptitious access to private subs**, and usage of this extension *when browsing a private sub* is effectively the same as actively giving out information about said sub. check your sidebar to see whether [that's a paddlin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFgR0m-9FmM) in your local jurisdiction.

it bears noting that private subs aren't exactly super secure things to begin with and this particular 'risk' should be weighed with due consideration that private subs are less *super sekret clubs* than they are bargain-basement spit-guards against the hoi polloi.

*(this is an xpost from [SUBREDDIT_REDACTED]. if you want this advisory xposted to your private sub just invite me and i'll do it for you, lol.)*

tl;dr: you can use old motor oil to fertilize your lawn

**update:** [a brief technical analysis of the plugin on SRSMeta](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSMeta/comments/18c7l3/is_unedditreddit_safe_to_use/c8dpqqi). this confirms that the plugin treats private subs the same as public ones.

Lately I've gotten a lot of reports about comments, as well as a lot of PMs requesting that I ban people who are active in ToR. There's been an uptick in such reports since the policy change on Monday, but it's been an consistent feature of moderating this reddit for some time now. The general message I've received is that certain outsiders are bringing down the level of discussion or otherwise trolling ToR.

My suspicion is that ToR is attracting trolls by making bogeys out of groups it would do just as well to ignore. We get entirely too many posts about SRS, and very few of the submissions we've gotten about Monday's policy change have been constructive. The more we howl about the admins purportedly caving to SRS and SA, the more justified they're going to feel dropping in and poking at us with a stick. All this for a decision that, quite honestly, doesn't haven't any effect on the vast majority of users.

And in case anyone missed it, [at least one admin](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/pmk22/admins_today_we_are_adding_another_rule_no/c3qk6s9) has denied that this was a bid to avoid bad press for the site. It was about compliance with legal requirements, and the work load that put on the admins. Until someone comes up with evidence to the contrary, I consider that case closed. Yet ToR continues to talk as though it were clear that there wouldn't have been a policy change without the SA campaign.

A lot of this drama could be avoided if ToR contributors would stay focused on [constructive discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/p9c0m/a_mild_corrective/). There's some room to talk about the possible side-effects of the policy change, but so far I haven't seen any suggestions as to what *we* could do about it, or anything but slippery-slope speculation as to how it might end free speech on Reddit -- certainly nothing that would, to my mind, justify the dozen or so threads we've gotten on that topic in the past 48 hours.

So, sure, I could start banning people. It isn't like my modqueue doesn't get a new spate of reports every day. And when those people turn around and create new accounts to troll us again, I could ban those, too. I could ban new accounts every day, and I wouldn't even mind that if I thought it would ultimately make a difference.

The catch is: I don't think that. I'm convinced that actual trolls are only part of the problem. The other part -- the part that's going to continue to attract this sort of behavior -- is this community's eagerness to assign blame. If it isn't SomethingAwful, it's ShitRedditSays, and if it isn't SRS, it's ex-Diggers. Or Facebook. Or high school kids, or newbs in general, or whomever you think represents the lowest common denominator.

Take a look back at some of [my submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/search?q=author%3Ablackstar9000&amp;restrict_sr=on). You'll find that a lot of them are about structural features of Reddit that we have to acknowledge and account for if we want to make constructive changes. Very few (if any) are about people we have to oppose. As long as we focus on finding someone to blame for what we don't like about Reddit, trolls are going to continue to see us as an easy mark.

As far as I'm concerned, playing gatekeeper for ToR is just going to perpetuate both behaviors.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_pqsie,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/pqsie/assigning_blame/,moderator

I try not to do so unless a) doing so will result in an interesting new way of approaching Reddit, e.g. /r/Excelsior, or b) it's the only way to keep a reddit from going off-track.

/r/TheoryOfReddit is going off-track, and has been for a while. I've resisted imposing rules to halt that tendency simply because, in all cases, I'd rather the subscribers to a reddit make a concerted and conscientious effort to stay focused on the purpose of the reddit, but by now it's clear that won't be the solution here. [Exhortation](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/pqsie/assigning_blame/) hasn't done the trick, so here is the new plan.

You may have noticed that there is a new moderator at ToR, [whyicry](/user/whyicry). That moderator has a title: ""diplomat."" The purpose of that new position is to handle relations with other reddits that turn up rather frequently on ToR. Right now there is no other reddit that gets anywhere near as much attention on ToR as /r/shitredditsays. It gets so much attention, in fact, that it's distracting from the sort of topics that, as I have specified in the past, are [what ToR was for](http://redd.it/p9c0m) in the first place.

At present, the diplomat's sole job, then, is to enforce the following rule:

No more than two SRS-related submissions will be allowed each week.
---

Moreover, only certain submitters will be allowed to make those submissions. One is the ToR diplomat, whyicry. **Anyone who would like to make a point about SRS will have to do so by messaging the moderators and suggesting their post to the diplomat.** Each week, whyicry will look through any suggestions that have accumulated and either c&amp;p one, or assemble a summary of all the points made that week. On weeks when there are no suggestions, there will be no official post.

The other weekly post can be made by the moderators of SRS, and must be made using one of the ""Archangelle""-themed accounts they use to moderate that reddit. That provision was included in order to give them equal time should they feel it necessary to provide a defense or make their own points about SRS. I've already discussed this with the SRS mods, and while they don't predict that they'll make use of that courtesy much, if at all, they understand my reasons for implementing the rule.

Inside those threads, conversation can continue as per usual. The point here is simply to canalize all discussion about SRS into a single pair of threads, so that they don't push out other topics. **All other submissions about SRS will be removed by the diplomat.**

The new diplomat position is an experimental solution, and if it works out, it may be expanded in the future to help address other problems.

I don't think there's a whole lot to discuss on this particular topic that doesn't involve going back and forth on whether this is an SRS victory, what ViolentAcrez and co. are going to do in the face of this, and how much grease and ice is on this slope (In my opinion: None.) but I submit it to you anyhow, Navelgazers, in the hopes that we can discuss if this is going to have any consequences beyond the obvious ones.

Using only one source (IMDb.com) ensured that people didn't make multiple posts for the same movie. We also inspired a bunch of other ""ranking"" subreddits based on the same idea (e.g. /r/TVCritic, /r/GameRanks, /r/albumcritic, /r/AnimeRanks, etc.), with about ~20k subscribers between us all.

All such subreddits no longer ""work"" because Reddit won't allow people to vote or comment on submissions once they're more than a few months old; so now these communities are all pretty much dead or dying, and their mods are not sure what to do (see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GameRanks/comments/migsx/want_to_see_rgameranks_keep_evolving_please_show/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MusicCritics/comments/npe3j/what_do_you_guys_want_out_of_this_subreddit/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/moviecritic/comments/qgem0/so_11k_subscribers_but_barely_one_post_every/), for example). [/r/MovieCritic](/r/MovieCritic) averages about one (valid) post every other day, and attracts a ton of spam.

* All of this data was gathered between approximately 10:20 and 10:55 PM EST.
* Subreddits with ""&lt;100 users online"" are considered to have 50 people online (yeah yeah, it's not fair, deal with it).
* I only gathered data down to subreddits that have about 15,000+ subscribers. At this point, almost all of them were starting to be in the &lt;100 range, so the stats weren't really changing any more anyway.
* The ""official"" subreddits (/r/blog, /r/announcements, and /r/reddit.com) are excluded.

***

A few days ago, I posted a survey to /r/atheism, as well as to /r/TheoryOfReddit, /r/circlebroke, and /r/self.

The survey was not intended to decipher a representitive opinion from any particular subreddit's users. It was designed to explore a couple of specific things, mostly regarding the opinions and beliefs of people who are critical of r/atheism.

The full results are [public](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AngLTjeGcV-WdDRvNnZMZ3FiSmdxWVZqWUVDd1UtRnc), and the survey [is still running](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDRvNnZMZ3FiSmdxWVZqWUVDd1UtRnc6MQ#gid=0).

* Composition of the 6,335 respondents (at the time I pulled the data) by their [answers to questions 1 and 2](http://i.imgur.com/0A2zA.png).

* Coded/grouped ""self-identify"" free text (the third question of the survey). The groups are usually the literal response that was given, with some corrections for spelling and groupings of rare or ""Other"" responses. For example, responses were only coded as ""Christian"" if they literally gave that response, and not if they also listed a denomination. Responses coded as ""Other"" have five or fewer responses. Here are the top 10 responses for those who answered the question ""Do you believe in a God or deity"" with [NO](http://i.imgur.com/YmC2l.png), with [YES](http://i.imgur.com/tUiTL.png), and with [I DON'T KNOW](http://i.imgur.com/gNtE3.png).

* [Response](http://i.imgur.com/Fymm0.png) to the question ""Do you believe in a God or deity"" broken down by level of agreement with the statement ""I can't stand /r/atheism"". Of those who *completely agreed* with the statement, just 25% believe in a God or deity.

Below are some slices of the responses, designed to show the importance that different slices placed on different statements. In each, I have ordered questions by the total score for that particular slice, on a metric defined by ""Completely Disagree"" = -2, ""Mostly Disagree"" = -1, ... ""Completely Agree"" = 2.

* [All responses](http://i.imgur.com/Syz6Z.png) for people who agree (mostly or completely) with ""I can't stand r/atheism.""

* [All responses](http://i.imgur.com/G6PA1.png) for people who agree (mostly or completely) with ""I love r/atheism.""

* [All responses](http://i.imgur.com/of04r.png) for people who answered ""Yes"" to ""I believe in a God or deity.""

That's really all I intended to get out of it, however the [full data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AngLTjeGcV-WdDRvNnZMZ3FiSmdxWVZqWUVDd1UtRnc) is there for your examination.

Thanks for all of your responses!",,False,,t5_2rtff,1341738659.0,,,True,t3_w7sr1,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/w7sr1/results_of_a_painless_survey_about_ratheism/,

I hadn't insulted anyone, hadn't offered criticism of anything, so I'm chalking it up to someone testing out a bot. 

I hadn't thought about it much until today, but I realized I've been reading a lot of comments about people complaining about Ron Paul downvote bots, about downvote bots that will go through and pick a page or two of comments and vote you down to a specific negative score (mine was -5 on every comment). 

Is this an issue that's becoming something the site will have to address or is it a passing fad? How do you even begin to address a system designed to spread downvotes for particular users or unpopular comments?",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_tdf3l,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/tdf3l/are_downvote_bots_becoming_an_issue_for_anyone/,

Basically, I've been running a bot that scrapes ""person defining"" subreddits:

* Political Discussion (/r/progressive, /r/Conservative, /r/socialism, etc).
* Religious / Atheist / Agnostic (/r/Christianity, /r/atheism, etc).
* Activism (/r/occupywallstreet, /r/Anarchist_Strategy, etc).
* Ethnic (/r/Arab, etc).
* National (/r/canada, /r/unitedkingdom, etc).
* Gender Orientated (/r/MensRights, /r/Feminism, etc).
* Racial (/r/niggers, /r/WhiteNationalism, etc).
* Lifestyle (/r/trees, /r/vegan, /r/Frugal  etc).

I'm up to about 110K comments right now and over the past day or so, I've been testing out queries that attempt to point out what subreddits are overlapping with each other. Note that I'll be marking **potential** ""Battlegrounds"" with a [**B**]. ""Battlegrounds"" are subreddits that tend to oppose one another. Sometimes, you'll find that members of both subreddits will visit each other in order to disagree, debate, troll and start arguments etc. Example of what the bot found for /r/Libertarian.

**Description:** ""Hang out on the new queue and flag carefully""

**What it really means:** Each day, 1 redditor is selected programmatically based on a high volume and diversity of upvotes/downvotes in the new section of multiple subreddits and how accurately he is able to predict the final outcome of those submissions. For example, if this redditor downvotes a large number of submissions that end up going nowhere, and upvoting submissions that go to the front page of that subreddit, he becomes more likely to win this award. Since only one is awarded each day, a very high amount of accuracy is required.

**How to achieve this trophy:** I interviewed /u/Quarter_Centenarian about this since he has won bellwether a total of 31 times. Here is the information he gave me:

&gt; When I'm in /new, I mostly concentrate on whichever memes are big that day and relevant news articles that I think redditors will like (sometimes they overlap). Big things like Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson are always hits too. Subreddit size doesn't matter - it's all about how well it will do relatively in its subreddit (so for instance, thousands of upvotes in r/funny vs hundreds or tens in tiny subreddits). In fact, I probably upvote more stuff in smaller subreddits in an average day just because I know they're more likely to gather attention from their niche crowds. Also remember that downvotes affect your chances of winning too, so if something is just awful, be sure to be the first person to downvote it into oblivion, but don't be wrong! I think I've lost a few times from misjudging a submission that actually went on to be successful. I browse /new in spurts, but I probably honestly average about 10-14 hours a day in it. I spend way too much time on reddit honestly, but it's fun to see the frontpage with all purple links from content I've already seen. Just lots of time, lots of knowledge about what reddit likes, and lots of patience.

&gt; I always upvote things in big and small subreddits. I originally tried winning it by upvoting only things in big subreddits, but I never won, so I started throwing in some smaller ones (a lot of &lt;100,000 subscribers, a good amount of &lt;30,000, a handful of &lt;10,000), and bam, started getting it. I think reddit's algorithm looks for diversity over size. I probably upvote one submission every 5-7 minutes on average (sometimes I'll upvote 3 or so really fast, and go on a 15 minute draught of nothing but crap), so on an average day, I probably upvote 200+ submissions, about 80% of which go on to be successful posts in their respective subreddits (I tested this a few times by keeping an Excel sheet throughout the day and at the end of the day, I went back and checked to see how they did). I'm not sure if it absolutely guarantees you won't win, but if anyone did as good as you without the screw up, you'll lose to that person.

I think Reddit (company side) is trying to make it seem like users are giving gold to one another by giving it out themselves (anonymity is key), and thereby making it common practice so that more users start jumping on the bandwagon. The result of making it seem like a common practice and courtesy would be a big bang in Reddit Gold sales.

There has been [requests to take bestof off the default reddit list](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/lol8z/petition_to_take_rbestof_off_the_frontpage/), but the motivation is different, it's due to the fact that the bestof submissions have decreased in value. 

On the other hand, really good submissions shoot up to the front page, and, as with the example above, trolls from the front page go to rather unheard-of subreddits, once a really good space for high-quality niche content are now infested by bad content makers. In essence, the /r/bestof referencing good content from the front-page is creating a sortof slashdot effect, but instead of high traffic, trolls.

Many thanks to /u/Deimorz who provided me with a data file containing the URL of every post ever made on reddit and which sub it was posted to - from that I produced a graph which I've hosted on this small interactive webpage:

http://redditstuff.github.io/sna/selfposts.html

(note - it works *much* better in Google Chrome than Firefox. It doesn't work at all in Internet Explorer :( Sorry, this is an issue with the graphing library I'm using so there isn't much I can easily do).

After finally getting around to doing this, it was surprisingly quick and easy to do!

I'd love to hear your feedback! I spent most of my time figuring out how to cut out unwanted data to show the interesting cliques, but there could be better ways of doing this. Looking at the data, I think I may have cut out too much so I'll see if there's a way of being less restrictive whilst keeping the graph usable.

If you have any better ideas for how I could filter the data or define the relationships then please do let me know, I'd be happy to have a go at adding it to the website.

Update: I've just updated the page so that now when you click on a subreddit it will open that subreddit in a new tab.

Update: Page now moved to GitHub hosting, see new link above. The site now also contains a basic search functionality! A few of you have been asking for less filtering and new ways of defining links. I've taken this on board and will work on it. I think this will require a whole new graph being produced though so watch this space.

Update: Holy underwear! We're famous:

1340238287.0,206,self.TheoryOfReddit,vcu9x,Let's talk about drama.,,270,64,207,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/vcu9x/lets_talk_about_drama/,"We've seen a massive increase of new users in the last three months, in no small part to submissions that have been linked to by other communities such as /r/SubredditDrama or /r/bestof. This subreddit has always striven to adhere to proper reddiquette, to read before voting, think before commenting, and above all to encourage civil and rational discourse at all times. We try to downvote based on the relevancy to the discussion at hand, not to show our disagreement. As many of you know, this is not the case for many other subreddits, which is why it is so damaging when other, larger subreddits come into our little playground with their friends, start playing with our toys without asking, and leave a big mess that we have to clean up a few hours later when they leave.

How many new users, exactly? When [blackstar9000 handed the subreddit to me](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/qwa97/under_new_management/), ToR had just under 10,000 users. Today it has 16,143, which is an increase of more than 60%, and if my experience creating and moderating subreddits has taught me anything, it's that this growth is only going to continue. Not only will it continue, but it will continue at an increasingly accelerated pace as time goes on. What that means is that in the near future, if it has not already occurred, new users will make up the majority of our userbase. Because of that fact, and especially since many new users may not be knowledgeable about linking between subreddits and how that skews vote totals, outside communities that link to /r/TheoryOfReddit for the sake of drama-watching or witch-hunting can and will alter the perceptions of these new members about our community, and not in a good way.

As our subreddit increases in size, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain proper reddiquette here. When another, larger subreddit links to, invades and massively derails one of our submissions, it throws everything out of balance. If the submission contains drama, a ""villain"" is usually identified and is downvoted mercilessly. Irrelevant jokes are upvoted to the top, and off-topic comments outnumber the on-topic ones. Due to the extra attention from a larger community, the submission is usually upvoted into triple digits or more. To new users, who as I mentioned above, probably don't understand how this alters vote totals, it appears to be business as usual for /r/TheoryOfReddit. What's worse, it appears to be a *wildly successful ToR submission,* even if this community would never have upvoted such a submission to such great heights without influence from a larger one. We don't want new users trying to create drama because they think that is what this community wants to see.

Case in point, we were recently the target of a witch hunt originating from a comment with more than 700 karma in /r/bestof, directing a large amount of users from that subreddit into ours. They proceeded to not only downvote every comment by the OP, but every comment that *spoke favorably* of the OP as well. One of our moderators spent more than four hours [handing out warnings](http://i.imgur.com/ihs4T.png) for personal attacks &amp; abusive language, to little avail. The tide of new comments did not stop. It only continued to grow as more subreddits picked up the scent, including /r/SubredditDrama. When the moderation team discussed this issue, we decided we had several options when dealing with ""raids"" from other subreddits:

1. Ignore the problem completely and hope it goes away on its own.
* Remove off-topic comments a la /r/AskScience in any thread that is being invaded from another subreddit.
* Remove the thread entirely, ignore the comments from that point forward, and let the witch hunt/circlejerk continue in an isolated space.
* Remove the thread, remove all of the comments, basically whitewash it. This is the most effective deterrent against raids, in my opinion. No one from an outside community will comment or vote in ToR after the thread has been whitewashed, they will resort to screenshots and stay contained in their own subreddit. New users coming into the subreddit after it has been whitewashed will have no idea what's going on, become bored, and leave.

I didn't think the first option was viable at all. I'm not in the habit of ignoring problems in my subreddits.

The second option was something we discussed at length, but raising the moderation of this subreddit to the level of /r/AskScience was not something I am prepared to do at this time. Dealing with the fallout of a witch hunt comment by comment (the most recent one contained over 1,000), and in a timely manner, would require increasing our moderation team many times over.

The third is something that I've done in the past, but doesn't really solve the problem. Incoming users often don't even notice the thread has been removed, and the problem often snowballs as other subreddits link to the ever-increasing drama within. [This problem is not isolated to /r/TheoryOfReddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/qnyiu/relevant_for_2xc_misogynist_websites_groups/c3zbuep)

Ultimately we made a decision. If we have to receive hundreds of new subscribers during a raid or a witch hunt, we want the first thing they notice when they find the subreddit is our zero-tolerance policy on raids and witch hunts. As a result, we have a new rule in the sidebar:

&gt;Witch hunts and subreddit raids will not be tolerated here. When another subreddit links to, invades and massively derails a thread in this subreddit, significantly affecting vote totals and posting off-topic comments, that thread will be removed by a moderator and deleted. This stops the raid immediately.

I waited a few days to discuss the issue to make sure that we were no longer the focus of attention from /r/bestof, /r/SubredditDrama, and others. We are currently looking into a bot or script that would ""save"" the thread and all of the comments within, to be posted to /r/TheoryOfModeration after the thread has been whitewashed. Any help in that area would be greatly appreciated. If I could simply lock the thread and remove it, that would be preferable, but unfortunately that is not an option we have as reddit moderators. As usual, we are forced to resort to [crude hacks](/r/TheoryOfModeration) instead of the proper tools we need to moderate effectively. However, that's a discussion for /r/IdeasForTheAdmins, and no amount of complaining in this subreddit will help the matter ;)

I'd also like to announce that we are looking for a few new moderators. I would like to recruit users who have a history of activity in the subreddit, and want to help enforce the rules as they are currently stated in the sidebar. Not only do I want to ensure that witch hunts and raids are dealt with in a timely manner, I feel that a larger moderation team will benefit everyone involved. Off-topic submissions will be more promptly removed, giving a clearer purpose to the subreddit and decreasing the risk of confusing new users about what type of discussion is appropriate. More mods also means more voices and opinions when it comes to policy discussion, and that is always a good thing. If you're interested, please leave a comment in this thread, rather than contacting the moderators privately.

The floor is open to any questions, criticisms or concerns you may have.

I must admit this being a sad day. Nothing explicitly to do with theory, but it is interesting to watch how Reddit reacts to news of high importance. The death of Osama Bin Laden is another, if I recall correctly, which facilitated a similar reaction. Though I don't know if it caused such a huge reaction as this or not. However, in the first hour since the announcement Reddit crashed only once for me - whereas we all remember what happened when Osama died.

What you find is a rush throughout all major subreddits (but also circlejerk) to get the news out. Submissions which are even a few moments late are generally downvoted, presumably because many Redditors navigate to the 'new' tab and reward the quickest person. Regular Reddit stuff but in a very small amount of time.

[This post - STEVE JOBS RIP](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l28pq/steve_jobs_rip/), I believe, was the very first post regarding the death of Steve Jobs. It was in fact posted, apparently, before the AP reported it. Whether it was someone in the know or an incredible guess one cannot tell. Though looking at the user's submission history - one may think the former.

[This was the next, once it was officially announced on Twitter](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/l2als/steve_jobs_apple_ceo_has_died/) and as it turns out the top submission on /r/all as of time of posting.

One suggestion that's proposed from time to time is to allow some customization of accounts. People want things like avatars and profile descriptions – the sort of customization that's basic to most forms of social media.

So far the admins have consistently ignored those suggestions. That has, I think, shaped our interactions on Reddit. It has, I'd say, shaped them for the better – or, at least, in interesting ways.

For starters, it forces us to be more interesting in the things we say on the site. Since we can't rely on avatars, signatures, and account descriptions to provide pre-fab personalities for our interactions, any personality that we hope to emerge has to arise out of discussion.

The only caveat is that the ability to name your account provides one opportunity for front-loading personality. The most obvious outgrowth of that is the evolution of the novelty account. But even there, the name is typically a means of suggesting the form that interactions will take. A name like ALLCAPSGUY is a prompt, reminding the user to shape their behavior according to a particular pattern.

There's another effect of our lack of profile, however, that could end up being as consequential, if not more so, and it's that effect that started me thinking about this in the first place. Given the lack of profile involved in our accounts, flair becomes a more crucial means of distinguishing accounts from one another. It's one of the few automated means of making an account stand out from the rest. For that reason, it will tend to exert a high degree of appeal for users who want to be distinguished.

More significantly, perhaps, while karma can also be used to distinguish accounts, flair differs in that it allows us to specify qualitative differences, rather than just a quantitative difference. When you see a person with abnormally high karma, you don't know whether they got that for consistently making fantastic discoveries, or for simply playing the repost game really well. Flair, on the other hand, can be used to append descriptions to an account, like ""friendly guy"" or ""grammar nazi.""

That's something of which mods should take more note. It allows them to offer flair as an incentive for helping to shape a sub. Allowing users to write their own flair ends up undermining that incentive.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_w17zv,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/w17zv/how_the_lack_of_profile_shapes_reddit/,

This presents a problem for reddit, at least, as things stand today.  These problems are will affect reddit's advertising revenue, and user happiness &amp; satisfaction with reddit's smaller communities.

###Advertising Revenue###
Today, reddit doesn't show ads on mobile devices - or at least I don't see them.  I paid the makers of Alien Blue to get a top notch iOS browser, but... as far as I can tell, I'm not generating any ad revenue for reddit when I use this software.

As I see it, the cure for this is to provide ads inline with reddit posts, every N links is an advertisement.  The frequency or existence of advertisements could be directly linked to whether the user account browsing has reddit Gold^tm .  If reddit does not have enough advertisements available, run advertisements for reddit Gold that indicate you won't see ads if you purchase it. 

Ensure the API terms &amp; conditions require displaying the ads, and that the app creator at least give a link to purchase reddit Gold.

This will generate revenue for reddit.com on mobile platforms via advertisement revenue as well as increased reddit Gold membership.

___

###Community Satisfaction###

I help moderate /r/Seattle - we're one of the larger city-based subreddit communities.  Mobile browsing has made my life harder, and with it's growth, unless something changes, it will only get worse.

The issue with /r/Seattle, and I would imagine with all smaller communities, is that we have certain FAQ's that address posts that the community sees frequently.  In /r/Seattle they are:

* Moving to Seattle
* I'm visiting Seattle, what should I do?
* Good places to eat in Seattle

We have other resources on the sidebar as well, from Music info to emergency services (to address the, ""Hey, why are there a bunch of firetrucks at this intersection?"" posts).

The problem with the rise of mobile is that **users no longer see the sidebar before they make a post**.  This means that we've seen a big rise in posts that the community is annoyed with; ""Moving to Seattle, where should I live?"", ""I'm visiting Seattle, what should I do while there?"" - these posts are seen multiple times in a single day.  This causes the regulars who subscribe to /r/Seattle to react in a couple of ways: they berate new users who don't know any better and/or they downvote the submissions.

It is possible to see the sidebar on Reddit Is Fun and Alien Blue, but... it's not intuitive or easy to find.  Also, the users need to know to that they should read it before posting; newer users and mobile-exclusive users have no any knowledge of the sidebar's existence until one of our frustrated users berates them.

This frustration causes new users to feel /r/Seattle is an unfriendlier place than it would otherwise be - ""My innocent post asking about moving to Seattle got down voted into oblivion, and the folks who did comment on it were rude!  Screw that community!""

My thinking on how to address this is to require all users, mobile and desktop, to view a mod-configurable block of text before posting.  Instead of a capcha to prevent bots from creating posts, require mods to define a set of questions that demonstrate reading comprehension of the ""pre-post text block""; the user could be asked something like, ""What is the topic of first link in the block of text above?"" - with the answer being something like, ""Moving to Seattle FAQ"".

I actually think any website should be able to make an account identifying themselves as the owner/writer  and submit their own content at will, not only because it would throw some variety into the mix of seeing the same 5-6 websites constantly, but because Reddit NEEDS some more variety and ultimately it's the users choice whether or not something should be deemed interesting.

One could claim /top of subreddits is that database. But that's erroneous because if you try to do that right now, especially for the largest subreddits, you can't go back more than few days or at most, weeks, without finding it hard to follow the sheer volume of articles.

Subreddit(s)

Minimum amount of upvotes

Maximum amount of upvotes

And perhaps more.


That way people will not be able to say ""I didn't see it"". Because people would then say ""Use the good database search feature"".

***

I'm a mod in many NSFW subreddits and, in case you were unaware, spam is a big problem on the NSFW side of reddit. I wanted to share an experiment that became an indispensable tool for combating spam.

***

### The Problem

Spam makes for a bad user experience and brings down the quality of reddit. Spammers on reddit use throwaway accounts, throwaway domains, redirects, and clever tactics to evade reddit's internal spam filter.

***

### Existing Solutions

1. **ReportTheSpammers**

 /r/ReportTheSpammers (RTS) was a nice idea but it cannot scale to the amount of spam on reddit. It's practically impossible to submit a post for every account created by every spammer. And not every submission is guaranteed to shadowban the spammer. RTS iffy, slow, and only curbs *future* posts by spammers; this method does *not* remove existing spam.

2. **AutoModerator**

  u/Deimorz has been more than helpful with configuring /u/AutoModerator for removing spam. There are some limitations to AutoMod, though. 

 * Limitations:

	* Require**d** human intervention to add the spam filter. Sending a PM to Deimorz to add a new filter takes time, courtesy, and is blocked on Deimorz's online presence.

	* Deimorz recently allowed mods to alter AutoMod's config by editing a Wiki page inside of the subreddit. Read more about this feature [here](https://github.com/Deimos/AutoModerator/wiki/Wiki-Configuration). But even with this new feature...

	* ...Spam filters are on a per-subreddit basis. I'm only allowed to add filters in subreddits I moderate; it's up to the admins to decide if a domain belongs in reddit's internal spam filter. And I can't be bothered to update 145 wiki pages across 145 subreddits. Deimorz has mentioned a feature for subreddits to ""inherit"" filters but this feature is not live AFAIK.

	* AutoMod was slow at removing spam - removals were delayed up to 10 minutes. 

	 * Deimorz has since addressed this issue and AutoMod now removes spam within 10 seconds on average.

	* AutoMod can't detect comments/posts that are edited to include spam; it looks at each comment only once.

	* New filters added to AutoMod will not be applied to existing comments and posts.

***

### A New Solution

With RTS and AutoMod lacking, /u/asstits provided the concept &amp; I created a bot to use custom spam filters. The bot:

 * Remove**d** spam faster than AutoMod. 

 * Detects posts that are edited to include spam. 

 * Applies new filters to the 500 most-recent posts and comments. 

	 This was great since I no longer had to bug Deimorz to add filters *and* it picked up some of AutoMod's slack. 

I added the bot to the subreddits I moderate in. /u/asstits pushed to get other NSFW subreddits to adopt the bot.

***

### Crowdsourcing

Managing the spam filters on my own was wearing me thin.

I created a website which allows ""trusted users"" to add spam filters to the bot without my intervention. The number of trusted users is enough to count on one hand. These are users I've known to be firmly anti-spam for many months and have proven their seriousness to the cause.

Pros:

 * Instant gratification - filters are applied immediately.

 * ""Scores"" - People like statistics and it's nice to see how much of an impact you're making.

 * The scoreboard turns the spam problem into a ""game"" which encourages trusted users to add rising spam domains to the filter.

Cons:

 * Human error &amp; trolls. A trusted user could add `imgur`, `reddit,` or `the` as a filter &amp; effectively wipe out the content of subreddit. There are checks in place to prevent this but it's still possible for mass-censorship to occur.

  * Careful selection of trustworthy users is the most important factor in this issue.

 * The public log ensures that other trusted users do not add questionable or irrelevant filters. All trusted users have the ability to remove filters created by other users.

 * Publicly displaying the filter lets the spammers know when they've been caught.

Note: We will assume the spammers don't frequent ToR and have to rely on security through obscurity.

***

### Results

The bot went public about a few months ago. So far the bot has removed around 15,000 spam posts &amp; comments with very few (less than 10) false positives. Due to the ease of incorporating the bot into a subreddit (adding /u/rarchives as a mod), the bot now moderates in 145 NSFW subreddits. I expect the impact to reach even further as time goes on.

The bot currently has ~800 spam filters that have been added by trusted users. I could never imagine sending 800 filters to Deimorz or adding 800 filters to a wiki.

The bot also has custom filters for detecting different types of spam that couldn't be parsed in a wiki (or would be difficult).

### Conclusion

Automating simple processes like detecting &amp; removing spam has been the key to keeping spammers out of reddit &amp; keeping relevant content flowing. As spam evolves, techniques have to evolve along with it. Crowdsourcing spam filters has proven to be an effective deterrent to spam in NSFW subreddits.",,True,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_1j2t36,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1j2t36/theory_in_action_crowdsourcing_the_nsfw_spam/,
1364239658.0,193,self.TheoryOfReddit,1azowe,I'm always fascinated by the concept of the reddit comment whose karma score is significantly greater than that of its parent. Has this been discussed here before? [x-post from a(n) /r/firstworldanarchists post's comment],,245,52,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1azowe/im_always_fascinated_by_the_concept_of_the_reddit/,"There's always something unique and tangible about this kind of comment--something that truly, and quite literally, makes it stand out. It's always incredibly insightful, hilarious, awesome, or otherwise truly an outstanding comment. They're basically the high-quality comments of reddit, and because of that I think it actually might be possible to ~~get~~ learn the full reddit experience by just browsing such comments, as you would start to understand a lot about reddit's (or at least its commenters') group-think.

Of course, to browse these comments, you'd not only have to round all of them up, but also make sure to round up the context for each of them too. If I had the time, I'd love to research and figure out how to make a script that does this--

     search through reddit comment DB
     collect all comments X with significant positive karma discrepancy between theirs and their parent's
     for all such X, display
         all direct comment ancestors as a reply line, ending with X at the bottom
         the original post the resulting root comment replied to
         the subreddit this original post was posted to

As a programmer, I can't imagine this would be hard to accomplish at all, as the actual ""thinking"" or processing of data is minimal; the most time-consuming part would be searching through reddit's DB and collecting the relevant comments and all related data. It'd be cool if someone already knee-deep in reddit API (unlike me) would want to deliver this to /r/TheoryOfReddit.

Oh also, someone pointed out in a reply to the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldanarchists/comments/1aywbo/there_goes_that_theory/c925oap) that downvote brigades and simply awful posts might skew results; certain comments might rank well above their parent comment, but only because the parent comment sucks (or at least sucks to a specific subgroup of redditors), not because the child comment is really all that outstanding at all. That would definitely have to be checked for in the results if we ever got anything up and running.

EDIT: As /u/ThatsNotMyPenis pointed out, this is the same for comments posted to /r/BestOf, resulting in an unintended(?) **up**vote brigade, as people visit it, agree it's a great comment, and upvote it, without even looking at all at its parent comment. While it's a great comment that would cause this in the first place, it's not really a natural creation of the kind of ""outstanding"" comment we're talking about.

EDIT: Here's how I'd solve the problem of low-scoring parents: have the option to include or not include relatively high-scoring comments whose parents are extremely low-scoring.

As there is a definite slow but constant decline of comment karma as you descend a comment tree from its root, it should easily be detectable when there's an outstanding post:

     +215 karma, +86 karma, +31 karma, +2000 karma

as opposed to just a flame war situation:

     +18 karma, +12 karma, +8 karma, -10 karma, +20 karma

EDIT 2: I'm seeing a lot of well-founded fears about this kind of thing actually changing how reddit users operate if it were to be implemented in Reddit or RES (something I didn't even consider as a possibility). I think they're absolutely right--this shouldn't be added there for all to use, not before we figure out what it would mean for reddit, and not until there was enough evidence that there's even a *reason* for doing so.

An idea to make sure this all can be avoided in the first place is if we made this only search through posts that have already been **archived**--the ones that report ""sorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted on"" when you try to vote on it, and don't allow new comments. I think these are older than 6 months or a year or so? It's a long time gap from present day, but 6-month ago reddit is still reddit, and it still has a lot we can learn from

Another possible positive for only searching through archived posts and comments this is that, while reddit skews voting results a tad to keep away spammers (or whatever it is), I would think (or at least hope) that archived posts show their exact, unaltered, voting results, as they can't be edited anymore anyways.

I don't scrape until the submissions are at least a week old, so this shouldn't really include most submissions that are removed, but might be off a little due to removals/deletions. I also didn't make any effort to combine domains that are really the same site, like i.imgur.com and imgur.com, youtube.com and youtu.be, etc., so the rankings are a little off because of those.

A year ago we had 2K readers; now we're at 7K and the increase rate has doubled.

We have a core of dedicated unofficial user-mods who actively model/coach good reddiquette.  
Blogspammers are soundly trounced. New users get gentle, warm guidance. Many readers have learned to upvote both the ""cute"" content AND the valuable/thoughtful stuff. Memes are infrequent. (Is all of this true all of the time? No, but we try.)

Keeping it like this takes delicacy and vigilance. Viral growth might just totally screw things up.


We'd prefer, many of us, to be *found* by those who are *looking* from their own interest,  
not *discovered* by folks *sent* here by notoriety. We're here because we love what we do, not because it's currently cool, and we'd be perfectly happy if /bestof never glanced our way.  

Does anyone else feel this way about your small but ""pure"" sub?  



Patrons of a favorite pub get grumpy when their quiet space gets discovered -- but the owner is usually happy for the increased revenue. Here there's no owner, no profit margin, just us patrons. Is it wrong to hope that business never actually booms?

edit: We already mod quite heavily. If you check the (chatty but clear) sidebar, our policies are delineated -- and enforced. Sometimes by the mods, but more often by the ""user-mods"" -- we've worked hard to teach the idea that *anyone* can call out a mis-user, point them toward the sidebar, and hit ""report.""

Often I'd see neat things on reddit and then some time later I would remember it and try to find it again and Google would be nearly useless, even when using specific keywords and reddit's name.

For example, the case that triggered this post:

I've been thinking about moving from Spotify to Google Music. I remember seeing this tool posted on reddit that transfers your playlists. So I Google a bit and I find out it is called Portify. So I search: 

    portify reddit

Normally, Google reads my mind, here it is failing spectacularly.

This has happened to me many times, this is only the most recent one.

Has anyone else experienced that? Does Google simply not understand reddit or is it a concious decision implemented to tone down the astroturfing campaigns that happen on reddit?

I realize now that I handled it extremely poorly, in hindsight I should have given him at least one more warning and subsequent time to cool off before resorting to a ban. Both of us were acting on incorrect assumptions... I assumed he wasn't interested in compromise and was simply trying to push the boundaries of the new rules to make the moderation team look bad, and he assumed I was blatantly lying to him and had no intention of listening to or acting on his feedback. Neither of those assumptions were true.

By no means does this excuse my behavior, but for two weeks prior to this confrontation, I had watched my mother deteriorate physically and mentally while in hospice care for liver failure. The day the /r/SubredditDrama thread was posted, I had watched her die in a hospital bed. I was extremely stressed out, I acted rashly, and I apologize. As a result, we now have a new policy regarding bans.

Rule five stands as it is now. I feel very passionately about that rule, because I think everyone should be expected to behave civilly while in this subreddit. However, starting now, any violation of rule five will result in a warning. Subsequent violations will result in a second and third warning. After three warnings, a temporary (two week) ban will be put into place while the entire moderation team reviews the situation and decides if the ban should be temporary or permanent.

I think that this is largely due to the way that comment sections are structured. The fact that user names are very discrete, and there are no avatars means that comments just merge into one another in a similar manner to 4chan. This helps build up the Reddit-as-a-consciousness illusion.

The difference with 4chan is that it is constrained by the chronological ordering of comments.

With Reddit you can read a series of comments that comes across like lightning fast banter.

&gt; My goals were to consolidate all the speculative images and ""who did it"" posts into one subreddit (they were all over other subreddits), with specific rules regarding personal information. I tried to create a subreddit that would purely look through images and send suspicious things to the FBI, which is what the rules I wrote reflected from the start. This was, of course, pretty naive — as pretty much every post made it to Facebook, Twitter, and even mainstream media.

What I want to suggest here is that a major part of the problem here was a fundamental mismatch between oops777's goals and what Reddit is actually built to achieve.

When I first created this account, comments were still a relatively new addition to the site's functionality. The primary draw was still its ability to aggregate, to help surface interesting sites and pages that you might not otherwise have found. Over the years, I've seen a greater and greater emphasis on community and conversation, with numerous people saying that they joined because they had been attracted by the relatively high standard of discussion on the site. Today, user-created content dominates the front page, and self-post-only subreddits represent a significant proportion of the default set.

There has been, that is to say, a self-perpetuating cycle reinforcing the notion that Reddit is primarily another form of discussion site, similar to a BBS or the comment threads of blog. In light of that perception, it was natural that oops777 would think it feasible to structure a crowd-sourcing sub as a sort of discussion board.

Design matters, though, and the fact of the matter is that the most basic design elements of the site still cause it to function as a social aggregator. It was, therefore, even more natural that what was posted in /r\/findbostonbombers would rise to the top and spread therefrom. That, after all, is the functionality for which the site was initially built—to take contributions, subject them to a vote, and display the results to as many people as possible. Any other functionality it might provide is secondary to that basic design principle.

The point is this: Many of us enjoy slightly breaking the functionality of Reddit in order to make it do things for which it was not designed. Often, we don't even think of it as going against the grain of that design, but we do so at our own hazard. Whenever we post or create a sub, we do well to remind ourselves that Reddit functions first and foremost as an ""attention aggregator,"" and that the safest thing to do with information we don't want aggregated and popularized is to keep it off of Reddit in the first place.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_1cy95r,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1cy95r/how_we_use_reddit_v_how_reddit_uses_us/,

&gt;""Professional marketing consultant here. Sometimes the stupidest fucking ads bring in the most revenue. You'd be surprised how much thought goes into something so stupid. Just the fact that people are talking about it, even negatively talking about it, is doing something very important: **It's subconsciously implanting the idea that Gieco is important enough to talk about.**

&gt;It's also subconsciously implying that Gieco is such a good company, their commercials should be held to a higher standard. These subtle suggestions make a difference when someone is buying insurance. Often, it's more important to just be lingering in the person's head. 

&gt;That's why jingles are effective. $5 foot long anyone? Even if it's for a negative reason, as long as your brand pops up in someone's head before the competitors, it's often enough.

*****

&gt; ""I am part of an advertising company. My team has manufactured numerous front page posts over the past 2 years. Already, we are prepping for the Dark Knight Rises campaign. This consists of ""story boarding"" ideas for funny pictures, like maybe a silly situation that happens at a movie theater where the DKR marquee is conveniently in the frame, or a submission that starts with ""Look who I found when I went to see the DKR this weekend!"". We are also allowed to screen the film early to pick out plot points that would be ripe for a ""Scumbag Batman"" or ""Scumbag Bane"" type meme, so we can plop those up immediately following the films release.

&gt; In order to do this, we need to maintain plenty of ""average"" accounts. This means having an account that's been active for 6+ months, posting semi-regularly, gaining karma steadily, so it's not rejected by the community when ""they"" submit their advertising.

&gt; Edit: Since people are showing interest, here's another example: An ad for a consumer electronic device, let's say a 3DS, where it appears that the person who took the photo is on a plane sneaking out an iphone style picture of a flight attendant playing a 3DS on some down time over the flight, behind a half closed curtain where they usually sit. There really are low to mid budget ""photo shoots"" where the output is a kind of blurry iphone picture, it actually makes me laugh sometimes. Maybe if a certain airline was willing to throw some cash our way, the title could be something like ""Delta picks the best stewardesses"" or something ironic and that would attract upvotes in a moment of ""Oh I get the joke!"" (theres a whole psychology of getting upvotes). This isn't something that was actually shot, but it's the kind of stuff we conceptually storyboard.

Not only do very few people look at each other's usernames unless it's ANAL_ANARCHY or something, but within about 5 seconds of looking away it's forgotten. It's also impossible to learn anything about them as a person without following their posts, which is impossible even with RES' Friends function, because there's no profile feature on Reddit. The messaging system is basic at best and it's impossible to add any personality to your account without being a novelty. That's one reason so many novelty accounts exist IMO, because it's really the only way to inject any kind of personality into your contribution to the website.

*And yet...* Reddit fancies itself as a sort of network of communities. But these communities are, by and large, never close-knit. Nobody knows each other as individuals unless it's a novelty account, a moderator/admin, or someone who's risen to the ranks fo ""Reddit Celebrity"" like Drunken_Economist or Karmanaut for example. So that leaves probably 90%+ of users who have no idea who the other users are.

Surely Reddit should be doing more to fix this? Not to mention, why are subreddits that actively promote more inter-user communication like /r/dating and /r/friendship so undersubscribed? Do the users of Reddit not *want* to form relationships with other users here, or does the thought never really cross their mind? Or is it simply that they aren't aware that subreddits like this exist?

But then there's also the fact that even on subreddits like /r/foreveralone, where people are forming a ""community"" of people who have poor social lives, there's *still* almost zero effort on the part of those users to form relationships with other users of that same community. I mean, they're all fashioning themselves as ""forever alone"", so why hasn't it crossed their mind that perhaps what they should do is befriend some of the other users? But that leads me back to my previous questions; is it because Reddit, as a website system, is fundamentally flawed in the way it treats inter-user relationships? I'd also add that I think it's an absolute tragedy that this is all the case. There are *so* many people here who are absolutely desperate for friendship or a serious romantic relationship, and yet we just walk by each other.

This is a fun project I have worked on for the last week and my findings from it. I encourage you to dig through the data that I will post if you want to see how subreddits are connected. I also saw /u/kjoneslol's post about tracking sidebar views. Very awesome timing I think.

# The Crawling

I created a program using C# using [Html Agility Pack](http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/) for parsing the webpages. The crawlers would go to a page, search for the &lt;div&gt; that held the sidebar, and then scrape of the subreddits it linked to. Those scraped subreddit names were added to a queue to explore later (I did include a list of explored subreddits to prevent duplicate exploration). I initially queued all of the default subreddits.

Then, after the scraping was finished, I wrote the subreddit connections to a .gv file as a digraph. That file will be made available for download.

I plan on releasing my program on a later date.

# The Results

[Here are some visualizations of my results](http://imgur.com/a/drwDV). This was done with Gephi 0.8.2.

[Pre-formatting/cleaning File ""result.gv""](http://www.mediafire.com/?9m4km7d6z7sjnna)

[Post-formatting/cleaning File ""result_cleaned.gv""](http://www.mediafire.com/?lq476c9ssygqf19)

# Conclusions

I call this the Surface of Reddit because it's what can be easily found by users just by clicking sidebar links. It consists of approximately ~~5.4k~~ 29,439 subreddits and 81.9k connections between them.

[Metareddit tracks over 238k subreddits](http://metareddit.com/reddits/).

So my scraping barely scrapes the surface of what Reddit consists of, but those 5.4k subs (at a quick glance) appear to represent everything that I have seen on Reddit. It has the SFWporn network, the Metasphere, the Fempire, and nsfw subs.

I'm guessing there are a lot of failed subs (started with a dozen subscribers with little/no activity) in that mix, but I'm curious about what else could be under the surface that didn't get linked.

BUT, and here is my theory, the failed subs aren't linked on ANY subreddits. I believe 3rd party linking to a sub is extremely vital to that sub's health and subscriber count, even more than previously believed. My new sub has doubled its subscriber count after being linked on the sidebar of a popular subreddit.

# Future

I think I'm going to start looking at metareddit and see if I can find what subreddits aren't found on the surface and what they discuss. I also think that sorting the data would be a great future project. When I post the .gv (need a few hours to take care of personal stuff first) then I suggest you join me with digging in.

We also should look at charting activity on surface subs and non-surface subs for comparison.

Thanks for reading folks!

# EDITS

- I have formatted the data and looked for errors. Apparently the regex I used to find subreddit names forgot to exclude query strings or anchors. So, I'm putting to files up for download. One will be the file before I cleaned out the extra links and one will be before I cleaned out the links.

- The subreddit count might be off. I re-opened the .gv and it gave me 7.4k nodes. I'll have to create a program to sort the data to find just exactly how many subs I discovered.

- Addition to the above. I sorted the data and found that there are 29,439 different subreddits that I discovered. This is about 12% of what Metareddit tracks.",,False,,t5_2rtff,1367041745.0,,,True,t3_1d6mkt,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1d6mkt/the_surface_of_reddit/,

So this is an update to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/11hyrm/update_trying_to_improve_the_quality_of_a/).

**::EDIT::** Totally forgot to include the announcement post: http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/12yexe/new_big_rule_change_in_rcars_please_read/

The gist of it is:

* Our community has grown from 12,000 subs to 55,000 subs in less than a year. 
* Community had essentially become an image board with imgur links dominating the front page
* We eventually decided to implement a [spotted] tag rule. If you posted a picture of a car you saw out in the wild somewhere you had to include that tag. 
* Even with that tag, relatively boring exotics like Ferraris and Lamborghinis and Nissan GT-Rs would dominate the front page. 
* Images without context also dominated the front page. These included images clearly taken from a Google image search.

We decided to ban all links to imgur and links to direct images. But self posts containing images are still allowed.

We truly believe this will improve the quality of the subreddit. We have a couple vocal users who say we're ""killing"" the subreddit but of course we think that's not the case. 

As far as strategy goes, we purposefully enacted the change late at night (10PM PST) the day before our lightest traffic day (Saturday). That way the vocal minority wouldn't get a chance to rabble rouse too much. 

So far it's already working. People are actually discussing cars and car-related news and technology rather than circle jerking over the latest Lambo find.

Its userbase is oblivious to the origins of their content and often claims responsibility for the creation of popular Internet memes. This perception is only encouraged by the watermarks that 9GAG automatically adds to every image.

Like Reddit, the self-described ""9GAG army"" formed an identity, a culture of exclusivity around the content they consume. The result is a primitive, vacuous imitation of Reddit heavily featuring advice animals, rage faces, and other Internet memes. If I didn't know better, I would call it a parody of Reddit.

It breaks down the posts on the front page by word and creates a trending list out of them, among other things.

I think it's pretty interesting to see it in this kind of format, and you can search for a word if it has hit the front page and check where it is on the list.

**EDIT:**

* I've implemented a new Stop Word list from [this site](http://www.textfixer.com/resources/common-english-words.php), and added a few of my own. It seems pretty comprehensive so we'll put it to the test.

* I've also removed all non-alphanumeric characters except ', /, and - because of sub-reddits and users using the / and ' to show possession when needed.

* I will also be keeping track of ""All time"" top words in addition to trending words.

* I decided to reset the trending list at 500, which gives words around 1.5-2 days to trend.  It was just the easiest way to implement an actual trending system until I have a better way to do it - and yes, I realize this somewhat penalizes popular words, but if they are that popular they will start to trend again quickly and it won't be a big deal.

In order to implement these I have to wipe the current data - which is something I hope to fix in the future.  I need to wipe it anyway though because it has all of that garbage included in the words.

I'd like to know what you think about the subreddit, /r/murica. 

When I first visited the subreddit, I was under the impression that it was a satirical portrayal of modern day American nationalism; but over the past few weeks (and especially the past few days) it seems much more serious and genuinely patriotic. I realize that the sidebar says it is, ""A satirical subreddit to celebrate freedom, except for when it is a serious subreddit to celebrate freedom,"" but I always interpreted that as a joke. Regardless, as the subreddit gains more popularity and visibility in /r/all, a growing number of posts seem more serious and less satirical.

What is the reason for this change? Were patriotic Americans stumbling across the pictures and memes and mistaking them to be serious? Do some people just suck at satire? Or is there some sort of effect from being exposed to the same joke over a period of time. In other words, is pretending to be patriotic in the name of humor actually causing people to become more patriotic? 

I noticed something similar in /r/ImGoingToHellForThis. It seemed like making jokes at the expense of minority groups led to an increase in racism and legitimate hostility in the comments. I figured it was just becoming a place where racist people could gather while others made insensitive topical jokes (wow, I wrote that second part so I wouldn't offend people in /r/ImGoingToHellForThis, crazy), but after watching /r/MURICA grow more patriotic I'm starting to wonder if joking about something actually has an effect on the way people think about it.

The Participation Choice is a synthesis of primary and secondary research conducted over the past 18 months. The data published are all taken from a recent, large scale survey of 7,500 UK adults - representative of the UK online population.

*- Definition of digital participation*    
De definition used for digital participation in this research: Creating and contributing so others can see 

*- 77% of the online audience is active in some way*     
Reasons given for this rise compared to the 2006 10% (the 1% and 9% combined): 

* Higher internet penetration (for the UK: 76% compared to 60% in 2006)
* Multiple devices (smartphone usage, tablets, IPTV) 
* Rise of products that make participation easier (Think facebook, twitter, flicker, etc) 
* Changing cultural norms (Digital participation is now seen as normal, everyday and in some case frivolous) 

This 77% can be divided further resulting in the following: 

* 17% Intense participation: Highly active in range and number of activities they do. The activities they lean to also require more effort, skill and time. Characterized as activities of greater expression: Views, opinions. The activities this group participates in also tend to get more exposure.
* 60% Easy participation: The biggest shift since 2006; lighter, simpler and part of many peoples every day. Can be traced to lower barriers of entry, see; cultural norms, rise of products, etc. If you have a closer look at these 60% and break it up even further you get two more groups 

The 60% can be broken down even further, resulting in: 

* 16% reaction: A group that tend to do the activities that require the least effort and are the least risk. 
* 44% initiation: Those type of activities that trigger the participation of other people; upload a photo, start a discussion, put something up for sale. For them it is about intimate group and they mostly (want to) participate around them self and their life. 

*- 23% of the online audience is still passive*    
Passivity is not as rooted in digital literacy as traditional wisdom may have suggested. 
11% of the people who are passive online today are early adopters. They have the access and the ability but *are choosing* not to participate.

All these percentage combined result in [this visual presentation](http://i.imgur.com/V3UFD.jpg), showing that there indeed has been a big shift. 

*- Final notes*     
It is really worth it to watch the video, the research also focuses also on the why aspect of this division. They asked people about in and in the lecture there is a great deal of attention to the choices people make (conscious or unconscious) that makes them part of one of the groups. However my feelings are that although they are related they might be worthy for another post entirely more focused on demographics instead of user behavior like this on. 

**My thoughts**     
Assuming this research is indeed executed properly and has yielded the correct results and assuming that the UK internet usage is somewhat representative for that of other (western) countries I do think that there is no denying that this does indeed impact how we have to look at Reddit and its users. In fact I do think this model suits Reddit pretty well imho, although making truly defining it can be confusing. For example: How easy is Reddit in daily usage? Without thinking about this it is hard to apply these things. 

*- Intense participation*
&gt;The activities they lean to also require more effort, skill and time. Characterized as activities of greater expression: Views, opinions. The activities this group participates in also tend to get more exposure.

The most easy (and flattering) conclusion would be that these are the people that drive Reddit, people that create the content. But I think that does no justice to Reddit's layered complexity, I think it is more applicable for those subreddits that indeed do require more time and effort ruling out subs that don't really require self made content (I am thinking of the numerous picture subs, the news subs). You might argue that when you submit you expose yourself to reddit and requires some skills (rules, etc) so most people submitting to largish reddits fit in this group. I am however not sure about submitting in defaults or in the smaller subs, more on that later. 

I am having a hard time fitting in the comments, so I am going to say that it really depends on the type of comments. I think that subs like /r/bestof and /r/DepthHub contribute to the fact that comments can get a lot of exposure and that combined that they are certainly activities of greater expression we will find also a lot of the the intense participants in the comment section. I'd argue that most of the people that fit in this categories also contribute with their own submission from time to time, however it would be interesting to able to confirm that somehow. 

*- Easy participation*
&gt; Those type of activities that trigger the participation of other people; upload a photo, start a discussion, put something up for sale. For them it is about intimate group and they mostly (want to) participate around them self and their life. 

I would argue that of the ""initiation group"" we find the biggest sample of this group in the smaller (local)subs where they can participate in the intimate group. However that would require knowledge about reddit as platform and the awareness that there is more than the defaults. 

So I think this group actually can be found in the defaults as passive users that might comment something easy but for the most still consume the content others provide for them. 
The lecture does not go into this but I am assuming that there is a 'grey area' between the different groups so it is entirely possible that of the ""initiation group"" on reddit some of them are actually in the process of transforming in intense participants by posting easy content to subreddits like the defaults (/r/pics and /r/aww come to mind) while others barely vote and would almost fit in the ""reaction group"" that is content by low effort participation and low risks. The ""reaction group"" would also be the group that you would never see commenting, they simply don't feel it is worth the 'risk' to do that or explore the option. 

*- Passive participation*     
This would be the group that only consumes and is hardly relevant for the functioning of Reddit. They might be relevant for Reddit as a company for add revenue but that is about it. 


*- Final thoughts*    
Although the 1% might be outmoded this research does seem to play well with [80/20 or Pareto principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), as far as intense participation, goes the principle states ""20% of a group will produce 80% of the activity"" which seems to be in line with the findings. I do think that further discussion is needed on this, it is just something I noted but I could be seeing connections that are not there. 

The above is just a quick brainstorm about my initial thoughts after watching and writing the summary. I personally do think that this is more usable as a model than the one we currently use, simply because it is much better suited to analyze the complexity of Reddit. We often forget how big and complex Reddit really is (millions of users) and according to what I have found so far about Reddit's demographics (I'll start another post about that somewhere next week) it mirrors the Internet's average, indicating we have a lot (really a lot!) of different people on this site. 


So after writing this wall of text I am really curious about what other people think. I have only given it some initial thoughts so it would be great if people could expand on it. And as I already had the pleasure of attending of 2 real life lectures today I might have missed something because of an information overload ;) 

So what do you think? Does this change the way we might have to look at user behavior? In what way? And how would you apply it Reddit? ",,False,,t5_2rtff,1350080840.0,,,True,t3_11dkzx,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/11dkzx/study_suggests_1990_or_1_rule_may_no_longer_apply/,

-------------------------

RisingThreads was created several months ago by /u/Quarter_Centenarian, with some help and testing from /u/TheAtomicPlayboy, /u/Drunken_Economist, and myself (/u/lulzcakes). The purpose of this subreddit was our attempt to filter out and better reddit's broken ""rising"" tab. /r/RisingThreads can, with approximately 80 percent accuracy, predict which threads will be successful in their respective subreddit (e.g. roughly &gt;= 500 karma). Mostly, these threads come from the main default subreddits (pics, funny, etc), but the bot can also catch threads from some of the smaller subs.

We considered making /r/RisingThreads available to everyone, but ultimately decided against it. Our main concern was that opening up the subreddit to the public would make the bot self-fulfilling. Did the threads front page because they were quality submissions, or because they had been posted to Rising Threads?

After a series of messages, Quarter Centenarian revealed the subreddit to POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS (PIMA) and added him as an approved submitter to rising threads. PIMA then created the account ""wikileaks_of_reddit"" and leaked screenshots of the subreddit to SubredditDrama here [""There appears to be a cabal of high-karma ""power users"" who are using private subreddits and bots to game both the comment karma system and the reddit trophy system.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ynxtr/there_appears_to_be_a_cabal_of_highkarma_power/) 

PIMA deliberately lied and sensationalized the subreddit, and then repeatedly harassed the moderators of Rising Threads. [Several of the messages he sent can be seen here.](http://i.imgur.com/p0wMf.png) You get the idea.

Using misleading and sensationalized information that PIMA leaked about the subreddit, many believed RisingThreads was being used to monetize or somehow game Reddit.

Let me be very clear. There has been NO financial gain and NO vote gaming from Rising Threads. It was a project amongst friends to see if we could create a more reliable version of the rising tab, and absolutely everything that this bot catches is perfectly available to the rest of reddit. 

We've now decided to make the subreddit public so everyone can use it. We hope you enjoy it.

The OP has cross-posted it in /r/IdeasForTheAdmins, and is encouraging readers who have likely never visited IFTA to vote it up there, essentially poll-crashing that sub. The general premise of the post is, ""Let's undercut Reddit's already thin revenue stream in order to force them to get involved in a political issue.""

This is almost a direct inversion of the way that boycotts usually work. Most boycotts are planned as ways to get companies to drop unjust or unpopular political involvement. The idea is to remove your patronage from a company so that your money doesn't go to a cause you can't, in good conscience, support. What's being suggested here is the opposite: removing your patronage from a company in order to decide their conscience for them.

I can't think of a single instance in which a group has staged a boycott in order to force a company to *adopt* political advocacy. It actually ends up being counterproductive for CISPA advocates, because now the Reddit admins have to thing about the results of coming out against CISPA. With this boycott plan having gained so much attention, there's basically no way that Reddit Inc could now agree to a blackout without looking like they caved to pressure. Which means that, in the future, any time a group wants Reddit on their side, they can just plot another boycott against them.

This all sets a very bad precedent. I understand the need to oppose legislation like CISPA, and I certainly don't want Reddit to be all LOLcats, all the time. But the plan being floated on the front page right now amounts to advocacy bullying.

More than that, as I suggested to someone in the IFTA thread, it affects the basic functionality of the site. It would mean the de facto creation of ""super-posts"" – submissions that in effect take over the front page for entire days, blocking out all other submissions, including other potentially important advocacy posts. It would mean that for entire days, the user involvement that generally decides which posts float to the top would be suspended. That, in essence, changes the basic operation of Reddit.

When I was mod, I tried to cant TheoryOfReddit toward constructive solutions that could be implemented by users and mods. This proposed boycott is the flip-side of that: a potentially destructive grass-roots solution that attempts to force the admins to change the site.

The overall purpose of this is to improve the quality of AR. More specifically, it's intended to force users to post their question in the title, and to get rid of posts whose sole goal is to spread the OP's message/story to a wide audience. 

The drawback I immediately saw was that users could no longer ask about situations that are specific to them- but this isn't necessarily a drawback because those posts are much better suited for subreddits like /r/advice and /r/self.

1327336968.0,174,self.TheoryOfReddit,ot0v9,An observation concerning the front page of Reddit.,blackstar9000,229,55,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/ot0v9/an_observation_concerning_the_front_page_of_reddit/,"The front page of Reddit -- that is, the page that 99% of the people who visit the site see when they visit the site at all -- is functionally biased toward lower-investment material (LIM).

Let me talk a bit about LIM. I've used similar terms before. Basically, when I write ""LIM,"" I mean material that can be viewed, assessed, and voted on with relatively less effort than other forms of content.

An image macro, for example, is LIM for several reasons. One is that it's an image, and most images are more quickly digested than a page of text. Another is that image macros are typically memes, and memes proliferate because they are familiar.

There's nothing inherently wrong with LIM, and some LIM can be quite valuable. All I'm concerned about here is a system that privileges LIM so heavily that greater-investment material (GIM) is increasingly excluded. And it's important to note that LIM and GIM are strictly relative terms. No content is LIM or GIM in itself. What may be LIM for one day may be GIM on another, relative to the other kinds of content submitted on each day.

Even articles can be, in a sense, converted into LIM. We do that by giving them LIM titles -- that is, titles that reduce the readers' investment. A sensationalistic title will do the trick. It does so by provoking an immediate reaction, so that the person who reads that title feels compelled to vote immediately, without having bothered to assess the article on the other side of the link. *That* is why so many of the articles that make it to the front page have comments that correct the title of the submission or the content of the article to which it links. The process of making a link to a GIM article into a LIM submission is, more often than not, destructive to whatever factual content it might have conveyed.

I've noted before that the new queue favors LIM the more active it grows. At lower levels of activity, it's still possible to foster and promote GIM, but once submissions come in at a rate that pushes them off of the front page of the new queue faster than most Knights of the New can adequately parse GIM submissions, LIM rapidly starts to take over.

The clearest example of that, it seems to me, is /r/atheism. There is a definite and discernible difference between the sort of content that dominated in that reddit when it was less active ([example from 2008](http://web.archive.org/web/20081103052525/http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism)\) and now that it is one of the most active subs on Reddit. Memes and image macros were once unheard of on the front page. Now links to image hosting sites beat out even the once dominant videos of atheist/theist debates. Relative to one another, videos are GIM and images are LIM, so as the /r/atheism new queue grew more active, the images displaced the videos.

The front page of the site (the page you see when you go to http://www.reddit.com/ while logged out) favors LIM even more. That's because it displays the default reddits, and the default reddits are chosen by the very metric that makes LIM so prevalent: rate of activity.

That means, that the front page favors not only LIM submissions, but more critically, it will generally favor the reddits that most favor LIM submissions. That's why three of the 20 default reddits (/r/pics, /r/aww, /r/AdviceAnimals) are explicitly dedicated to one of the most common types of LIM, images. /r/f712u would be up there, too, had the mods not opted out of default status. Others, like /r/atheism, /r/WTF, /r/funny and /r/gaming, though not explicitly dedicated to images, are nevertheless dominated by them, and increasingly so.

~~/r/AskScience had to revoke its default status in order to keep from being overrun by LIM comments.~~[*](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/ot0v9/an_observation_concerning_the_front_page_of_reddit/c3jxr6d) /r/askreddit, /r/todayilearned and /r/Iama survive, I would say, by shifting away from an emphasis on the sort of answers and discussions they receive, and more toward eliciting personal expression. Thus, the topics that tend to win out on /r/AskReddit are not those that ask for definitive answers -- that would raise the investment needed to participate -- but rather those that ask everyone to give their own personal response to a question with no definitive answer.

The apparent exceptions are the reddits still mostly dedicated to news, like /r/technology, /r/worldnews, and /r/science. But I'm not sure that even those are genuine exceptions. Rather, they've adapted by relying more heavily on LIM titling, which encourages the viewer to infer a given story's significance based on the perception they derive from the submission title. The titles that tend to do best are those that are most concise, direct, and unambiguous about the purported significance of the story -- that is, those about which people will tend to feel comfortable forming an opinion based on the title alone.",,False,,t5_2rtff,True,,,True,t3_ot0v9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/ot0v9/an_observation_concerning_the_front_page_of_reddit/,

My name is Deimorz, and I'm addicted to pulling statistics out of reddit.

A few days ago, I kicked off my biggest scrape ever: fetching data for every submission ever posted to reddit. This is a pretty huge chunk of data, considering there are already over 50 million submissions, and hundreds of thousands more are being made every day. Fun fact that I've already discovered: the submissions from just *the last week and a half* make up more than 5% of reddit's total submissions from over 7 years of existence. That's how quickly reddit's activity is growing.

Anyway, it's going to take at least a couple weeks to finish at this rate, but I wanted to start thinking about what I'm actually going to do with this data and see if anyone had some interesting suggestions. As some examples, here's the sort of things I'm already planning to do with it:

* Compare the rate of submissions and comments for various subreddits
* Find users that have made the most submissions, and find their ""average link karma""
* Find subreddit relations by finding pairs with many cross-posts
* Various statistics related to domains - which are submitted most often, etc.
* See which subreddits have the largest percentage of submissions filtered/removed.

Here's the data that I'll have available for each submission, so this will determine what's actually possible to do:

*Note: all submissions to private subreddits will not be included, of course*

* Subreddit it was submitted to
* Submitter name (or ""[deleted]"")
* Submission time
* Title
* Domain and full url (if it's a link post)
* Self-text (if it's a self-post)
* Score
* Upvotes and downvotes (fuzzed)
* Number of comments
* Whether it is marked NSFW
* If it's an ""embeddable"" media (the ones you can view without leaving reddit using the expander, like YouTube), the actual media's title, description, and author name (so for YouTube, the channel name)
* Whether the post is removed or not (unable to tell for sure whether it was an automatic spam-filter removal, or a manual mod removal, but I can make a reasonable guess based on number of votes/comments)

So... suggestions? And since I'm sure someone will ask, I'd like to make this data available to others, but I'm not sure how feasible it will be.

Remember how a couple months of months ago, people were complaining about the spike of memes during the summer, and the optimists responded that it would die down in September once the school year ended, while the pessimists said no, this will only get worse? Well, I think a verdict has been reached. 

I'd also like to ask if anyone thinks it's possible to keep this at bay. I can't think of any reason why it would, but r/ToR surprises me sometimes; that's why I'm subscribed. 

Lastly: to the people here who claim the community can self-moderate itself, does this not seem an exception? If the Mods of the major subreddits could tack on a message saying, in red, ""Viral marketing campaign"", wouldn't that be a good thing?

Here's the specifics this time around:

* Subreddits with ""&lt;100 users online"" are considered to have 50 people online. [It looks like we're likely to get more specific lower values soon](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/yjk55/proposed_change_to_the_users_online_count_for_low/), but not much I can do until then.
* Only subreddits with 15,000+ subscribers were scraped, below that almost all of them were giving ""&lt;100 users online"" anyway. 
* Scraping started at 00:00 UTC August 20 (which is 8 PM EST Sunday night), and was repeated once every hour, ending at 00:45 UTC August 21.
* Subreddits were always scraped in the same order, so even though it took about 45 minutes to get through all of them, all samples for each individual subreddit are very close to an hour apart.
* The ""official"" subreddits are excluded (/r/blog, /r/announcements, /r/reddit.com)
* All of the samples are available here if you'd like to do anything with the data yourself: http://steam-punk.net/users_online.csv

As a result, I want to talk to you about what happened on our side.  I'm going to try to explain about as much about SomethingAwful culture as I can so that you can really understand what happened.

SomethingAwful, like most traditional forums, is split into a small group of subforums.  Each one of these has a specific focus, like Games, Debate &amp; Discussion, Automotive Insanity, and General Bullshit (the catch-all subforum, frequently abbreviated ""GBS"").  The Redditbomb did not originate in General Bullshit, like so many Redditors seem to believe, nor did it originate in a seedy hidden area or IRC channel, but in a thread in Debate &amp; Discussion entitled ""Reddit is Awesome"".

RiA is a thread where we get together and mock terrible opinions and posts on Reddit.  We have similar threads for other sites, such as TVTropes and FreeRepublic.  As a former Redditor (my profile claims my last post was 6 months ago) I am admittedly somewhat biased against this site and find a lot of entertainment in mocking the worst of it.  Think of the thread as a SomethingAwful equivalent of ShitRedditSays, only without quite so much circlejerking.  It's worth noting here that a lot of the early users of /r/SRS were goons from the Reddit is Awesome thread.

Honestly, the vast majority of goons were just interested in mocking Reddit from afar, and we didn't give a shit about what happened to the site.  That was until we found the now-infamous user Tessorro and /r/preteen_girls.  Immediately there was a change in tone in the thread.  Before we had acknowledged the existence of the jailbait subreddits, and we were disgusted, but we didn't bother doing anything about them.  This one was different, because this one was unequivocally child porn.  /r/preteen_girls wasn't an SA plant or a false-flag operation or anything like that, it was merely a catalyst that turned Reddit is Awesome from a mock thread into a raid thread.

We started building the Redditbomb.  A user called Tony Danza Claus wrote the bomb in a few hours and posted an early draft to Reddit is Awesome.  The rest of us discussed it and made it better.  The bomb focused on the child porn, but we also included links to a few of the disturbing non-CP subreddits, like /r/picsofdeadkids.  Then, yesterday morning, the bomb went live.

Tony Danza Claus posted a new thread in General Bullshit about the so-called ""Pedocaust 2"", a reference to a years-old incident on SA in which all pedophiles and child porn were removed from that site.  The Redditbomb was the primary focus of the new thread.  We submitted it everywhere and anywhere we could think of.  I personally submitted it as a tip for the FBI and as a story to NPR.

Not long after this, the /r/technology post sprang up, linking to the thread in General Bullshit.  To an outsider, it absolutely looks like a raid, make no doubt about it.  In a lot of ways, it is, but the goal of the Redditbomb was and is to remove the child porn from Reddit.  Yeah, a few of us wanted to remove more than that (myself included).  However, having now pulled all of the *bait subreddits, we're considering it a job well done.  We're not going to do anything else like this unless the problem returns.

I also want to (briefly) touch on some of the conspiracy theories.  No, we do not want to shut Reddit down.  I think a lot of us, myself included, actually quite like the idea of Reddit, even if we're not happy about how it's turned out.  No, we do not want to shut down /r/MensRights.  It's a popular topic in Reddit is Awesome and a lot of us think that it's full of a group of misogynistic douchebags, but ultimately nothing harmful goes on there and they have a right to their opinions.  Yes, we do still want subreddits like /r/beatingtrannies taken down, and a lot of us still want /r/seduction taken down.  However, unless we are faced with an /r/preteen_girls-like catalyst, we're not going to be raiding again.

It's also worth discussing the screenshot that's been going around about Lowtax, the founder of SomethingAwful, asking us to take out /r/MensRights next.  This was a joke.  If you read the General Bullshit thread, you'll see that everyone took it in stride as a joke.  SomethingAwful is, above all else, a comedy forum.  Yeah, we do serious stuff like this from time to time, but for the most part we keep to ourselves.  Your rage comics and cat pictures are perfectly safe from us :)

**Edit:** Ah ha ha ha you guys are precious.  You're all right, y'know.  SA goons planted a false-flag operation 4 months ago to bring down /r/jailbait, and we did it again and got hundreds of online people to bring down a large group of disturbingly popular subreddits full of child porn.

1362901389.0,158,self.TheoryOfReddit,1a0kgy,Building a better moderator team on the /r/askhistorians model,eternalkerri,203,45,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1a0kgy/building_a_better_moderator_team_on_the/,"/r/askhistorians has reached 100,000 users in just a bit over a year through offering great content, good community, and a fantastic moderator team.  I want to address specifically the moderator team in how we achieved massive success in building a great sub without succumbing to the stereotypical ""Eternal September"" or the ""once they hit 60k (or 50, or 75 depending on who you ask) all subs go downhill.

1)  Mods must be active as mods.  Of course real life does come into play and we can't help that.  However, if your moderators disappear for weeks or months at a time, they aren't helping run the subreddit, it's best to cut them loose and replace them.  Be nice about it, people understand.

2)  Recruit from within.  Sorry, not to dig on ""power mods"", but bringing in a moderator that does not subscribe to the sub doesn't help anything.  They are not familiar with the culture of the sub, as I have found that different subs have different values, [mores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mores), cultures, in-jokes, etc.  Moderators *must* be familiar with the culture of the sub or they will definitely clash with the user base and cause unnecessary drama.

3)  Recruit the active, popular users.  The quiet user that doesn't actively participate is an unknown to the user base.  The active user is someone who comes into the game with a respect from the user base who will listen to their directions and want to buy in.  It also shows users who contribute quality content that they can have greater participation as a reward.  Additionally, these users are invested in seeing the sub succeed and thrive.

4)  Be transparent.  At least once a month we post a new [Meta] thread.  It always addresses current issues brought up in mod mail, threads, and user meta posts.  We reiterate rules, plans for changes, and let users know what is going on.  This removes claims of ignorance of the rules of the sub and of being ""nazi mods"".  We actually get complaints that we post to many of them!  This is always better than complaining that mods don't engage.

5)  Actively discourage mods fighting users in public.  This encourages trolls, users who want to foment discord (MAH FREE SPEEEECH!! types), people who have a grudge against mods, all those trouble users.  Always have them take it to mod mail, or have another moderator step in.  Moderators fighting with the user base is bad mojo, always.

6)  Have the mods talk to each other.  No team in the history of anything was successful if they didn't communicate.  If mods aren't talking your sub has issues.  Mod mail should be full of threads of moderators discussing issues about threads, users, topics, rules, etc.  A private IRC channel doesn't hurt either.

7)  Treat all mods as equals.  If you have mods that pull rank, kick other mods without discussing it, bully others, or publicly tear down other mods in public, you have issues.  You can't control a sub if the moderators are fighting each other.  The first sign you have a moderator who is trying to run roughshod over the others, its time to step back and have a pow-wow with the team, it might be time for someone to go.

8)  Cliques are bad.  Mods should not team up against other mods.  This isn't high school, if you have this issue, you have a bad moderator team.

9)  Have committed mods.  If you have a moderator that mods 20 subs, he probably isn't dedicating the time he should to that sub.  You can't moderate 20 subs effectively unless you literally spend hours doing it.  Sorry ""power mods"".

10)  Be friends.  Get to know each other beyond just the screen name.  I'm not suggesting spending your summers at each others houses, but get to know each other.  Being friends makes working together easier.

11)  Good moderator to user ratio.  We found that having one mod to about 6k users to work well for us.  It varies between subs and the relevant rules, but work to find that sweet spot.

12)  Let mods take breaks.  It's easy to burn out, especially in high traffic subs, or if a mod has been working alone for a while.  Let moderators step back and participate in the sub like a normal user for a while, let them work on real life stuff.  It's okay to let other mods relax.

13)  Large subs need international support.  We have hunted down users who live all over the world so that there is always someone who can at least keep the place from burning down.  If your sub hits 100k, it helps to have someone on the other side of the planet watching the place so that something doesn't happen that draws a brigade from some of the more nefarious subs.

Some of us love it, diving right in and feeling at home in the writhing bed of puns and memes and ragefaces and reaction gifs and exuberant herpderpery. Some of us loathe it, barring the doors and sprinting up the stairs of our ivory towers to safely sniff our corks and gaze at our navels free from the raging chaos outside. 

This tension between order and disorder is fundamental to the nature of reddit. The cards are heavily stacked against the forces of order - here as in nature it is easier to blur than to focus, easier to destroy than to build. What's more, the tendency towards disorder is dramatically reinforced by the presence of /r/all, in which successful links are plucked from their homes and presented to an audience that may be completely ambivalent to its original context. Such an audience may not care at all how the link's subreddit wishes to evaluate the link and its comments, and their votes count just as much as those of subscribers who are faithful to their subreddit's vision. 

Note that I have no real issue with disordered reddit behavior on its own - it is as legitimate a use of the site as any, and it can be a lot of fun. My chief concern here is keeping the peace between disorder and order, between the anarchic mainstream and the curated niche.   

Recently a few subreddits have begun implementing a tag, [/r/all], indicating that a post has reached the top 100 of /r/all and as such may have caught the collective eye of the greater hivemind. [This /r/games post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/10xk1i/simcity_gameplay_strategy_video_1/) and [this /r/gentlemanboners post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gentlemanboners/comments/10zitf/tina_fey/) carry examples of such tags.

I believe that these tags are an excellent presence for mods, subscribers, and for new visitors alike. Those who care about the structure of the subreddit are thereby alerted to the potential presence of the forces of disorder, and new users can understand that the content and comments may not reflect the nature of the subreddit they have just discovered.

It's an unfortunate irony that a link being widely approved in its subreddit can cause it to fall from the control of its subscribers. As far as I know mods do not have the power to prevent their links from breaching Mainstream-Reddit (nor do I believe that they should).

While brute-force tools are unavailable, awareness can be a useful tool in and of itself. Calling the process to light in our focused subreddits may be enough to slow or even prevent the rising of the tide. The awareness of the awareness of the hivemind brought about by these tags is a significant step in the right direction.

1330211610.0,155,self.TheoryOfReddit,q5zss,"How would the simple action of hiding karma scores on posts and comments, until the user has voted, affect the quality of comments and submissions?",ProfessorPoopyPants,176,21,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/q5zss/how_would_the_simple_action_of_hiding_karma/,"EDIT - This topic arguably requires a case study, if any moderators are going to try this, send me a PM first, I'll take before/after notes and do it properly.

I realise this is looking like a suggestion, but bear with me, this isn't, I'd just like a discussion on what effects it would have.

The ""sheep"" effect has a more prominent effect than any person would like to admit, it's a rather disturbing fact that it's evolutionarily hard-coded that one should follow the crowd, since invariably that's what will keep one alive. If one has a particularly high opinion of the intelligence of the person that went before you, this effect is increased.

Working under the assumption that the people using reddit have a favourable opinion of the general userbase (discounting trolls and mild masochists), when a user sees a submission presenting an opinion, and it's coupled with a large number of votes, subconsciously, they will alter their opinion on the subject matter, whether they've read it or not. This has the alarming effect of, whether it's an advantageous effect or not, leading to group confirmation bias, which on a site centralised on discussion is a bad thing, or at least leads to repetitive and uninteresting disussion since everyone already agrees. **With the current system, people are forming their judgement on a comment before they've read it.**

My proposition is this: hiding the votes, and doing a karma-biased randomisation of the comments and front pages, would lead to a more diverse set of opinions, or at least stopping users from being told what to think, and changing it more towards the users forming their own world views. They would question every post, instead of knowing what their view ""should"" be before they read it.

It also has the side effect of people constantly having their views challenged should their votes go against the general consensus, which is never a bad thing and promotes a more flexible world view.

*But*, if a user is set in their ways, and fed up of being challenged, would this lead to an exodus of users? People coming for mindless content instead of thought-provoking submissions would leave, but is this a bad thing?

Extra: What if it was an opt-in feature by the mods of specific reddits? What about for users?

Extra bonus: Forcing a user to say how much karma they THINK a user has accrued before they can read the actual value would be interesting, but nothing more than a menial exercise.

This is assuming that ""the proletariat"" DO read the scores on comments, or make the assumption that high on the comment chain = favourable opinion, for the sake of discussion. If they don't, great, but (personally) I don't think opinion circlejerks would form quite so spontaneously if users didn't have feedback about what everyone else thought.

**tl;dr** Good: encourages a person to form their own opinions before they are ""told what to think"", encourages openness to differing opinions. Bad: Exodus of users who came for the mindless content who enjoyed being told how to think. &lt;-- If someone can tell me how to make that sound less biased, please do. There's no way to not make that sound like a bad thing.

(We are of course discounting browser plugins to un-hide scores, there are ways around this such as sending the score along with the confirmation that the server recieved the vote.)

I'm very biased on this topic, and have quite a low opinion of the actual capabilities of the reddit community, so this is by no means a neutral discussion on this theory. Don't take this as gospel.

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x6yef/reddits_had_a_few_threads_about_sexual_assault/c5k055x?context=3

Now, the highest ranked top-level comments were from people who were related to perpetrators. Further down there were first-person accounts, but extremely remorseful.

serial_rapist_throway's account was somewhat different. It told the story of a man who was fully aware of what he was doing, intentionally doing it several times. He reflects on this past episode of his life with regret, but never tells of himself as the monster that some others guilty of far lesser crimes (such as one who got on top of a girl before realizing she did not give consent) do. 

And yes, as one would expect, commentors flame him for this. I can acknowledge why. But what I hate are the downvotes.

Yes, he may be a monster. But he directly answered the question of the thread, more directly than the others, and gave a full frontal view of what was going on, rather than secondary perspectives that gave others shelter from the emotional hurricane and turned that energy into upvotes. I want insightful comments like this. That's the point of these threads, and I love it when something challenges you from a place you would never consider, or think abhorrent.

When I first saw it several hours ago, it was sitting at a score of 901. Now it's down to 209. People have been downvoting it like crazy. I can only assume it's because of the pure hatred felt towards the writer and his actions. But it's a throwaway account, and it's been since deleted anyway. The author isn't getting any orangereds from the flames, and he probably couldn't care less about what happens to this orphaned comment, past the disappointment that the product of his time, effort, and emotional commitment to confess his crimes would be buried. Those downvotes aren't punishing his karma, they're not doing anything to him at all, and they're just burying something that I would very much like to read and have visible.

I can't help but feel this is at least partly the result of the child comments, which have whipped up the crowd's fury into a bandwagon. Personally I upvoted the comment, but I can't help but feel like it's pissing into the wind of broken reddiquette and downvotes as a ""I hate you button"" rather than the distributed content quality filter they're intended to be.

I have no idea how I would change this tide, and I've given up on most of reddit as a place for good discussion and lefthanded ideas.

In exchange for this, the sponsor is providing two ipads to the winners of the contest. 

How do people feel about this? Is this even allowable in Reddit's TOS by the mods? The way I see it, this corporation has found a way to advertise on Reddit without paying the fees that would normally be required (and would no doubt be far in excess of $1000), and dodge having to pay anything to Reddit itself. The ads are being hawked to a 130,000 person subreddit daily. 

If this is allowable by Reddit rules, what of when mods start taking personal payment for the campaigns as well? It is only one step removed from what we currently see. 

edit: A couple updates, so people don't have to read 130 comments to get the whole story.

First off, the sponsor [really is a corporation](http://i.imgur.com/FkcPUxN.png), so perhaps we can stop arguing semantics. 

An /r/photography mod has claimed here that the mod team worked with Reddit admins on this contest. However, Deimorz (a Reddit admin) has claimed that [this is not actually true](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1fokix/rphotography_mods_running_corporate_advertising/cacrdoa). The admins gave the 20 golds, but they were not aware of the sponsorship. 

edit 2: /r/photography has removed the banner.

For those saying this is a witch hunt, it was not a witch hunt, and was never intended to be a witch hunt. I would have posted to /r/drama or /r/wtf or /r/conspiracy if I was intending to rile up the masses. It was intended to be a discussion of the situation, its current allowability, and its potential for future problems. I am not, and have never condoned a witch hunt.

This thread is not for a political discussion for your or my personal views on the pros/cons of gun control, it is solely here to share a minority perspective that you will not see elsewhere. 

I have been discussing gun proliferation for about 4 months now as a mod of a sub I started long before Sandy Hook. Obviously you know that /r/guns has a zealous userbase dedicated to guns. For those that haven't been following they recently [dropped their ""no politics"" rule](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/15onie/meta_i_request_that_the_no_politics_rule_be/c7oecnl?context=3), turning it into the largest active gun lobby on the internet with 100,000 subscribers (perspective: it's the same size as /r/nfl). 

The number one issue for /r/libertarian, who are just as zealous (not saying that's a bad thing, there are passionate people across the spectrum), is gun ownership. Add in /r/conspiracy and you have hit the third rail (nearly every conspiracy involves confiscation of guns). They combine for about 300,000 users.  So if you wonder why you have only seen the NRA line on the front page after Sandy Hook (mental health), it's because nothing can survive 300,000 subscribers. 

I'm not a conspiratard, I'm just saying that through my personal experience nearly every day watching and debating in the new queue in /r/politics for gun related posts that nothing escapes there. What does escape? Nothing. Nothing, and I mean nothing, has hit the front page that could be considered progressive, which is a conspicuous absence given our progressive bent on everything else. 

Now I know you will sit back and say ""Gabour you are biased and crazy"" and yada yada. But you know what the first argument of the NRA is? ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people.""  What was the headline on /r/politics on Friday?

Right, guns don't kill people, mentally ill people kill people. And nuclear bombs don't kill people, people kill people with nuclear bombs - so why ban nuclear bombs. We got it. I have a public list I'm maintaining right now of how the dominate the front page, but I don't see the point, there are just too many to count. Those subscriber bases are big. 

Three weeks ago, /r/guns wiped three months of posts from my subreddit in an hour or so. That brigade has continued every day, all day, for three weeks straight, with each post receiving more downvotes than upvotes by the end of the day. Yesterday, a purported member of the Brady Campaign commented in my sub. Thirty minutes after being front paged on /r/guns, a weeks worth of posts were wiped out, forcing the sub to go private for a full day. It just reopened. 

This is not here for anything but to discuss the political forces that have and continued to shape reddit. I don't want your help (I specifically excluded the name of my sub for that reason), I don't want anything from anyone here.

A vast ammount of reddit subscribers view the community and website as a venue for sharing information, discussion, and forming smaller specified groups which connect otherwise annonymous users. These users have a very positive view of the reddit community and welcome moderation or regulation to maintain order and openness.

A second major population of reddit subscribers view reddit as a message board venue, similar to 4chan, where users can annonymously contribute solely as a means of entertainment rather than a source of comradery, information, or discussion. Rather than finding value in the website for its capability to bring anonymous users together over shared interest, value is derived from one's ability to share in a hive-mind identity akin to /b/ which operates outside of order.

These two major populations are inherantly opposed, and underlying these two views of the community is a deep philosophical question.
How does reddit value the rights of free speech, however broadly defined, and the right of web anonymity when juxtaposed with the tangible effects of hateful and derisive behavior in our community.

Is this a new direction for reddit towards more politically correct content? The vibe here in the past has been ""reddit is free speech"" but with the banning of these subs, things may be changing. I wonder if this is just the start of bannings of subs that contain questionable content. 

Someone suggested that reddit may be cleaning up for potential investors or if they plan to sell it, they don't want the PR nightmare of harboring racists. So if reddit bans racism will they ban gore pics or porn pictures or ""x"" next? I don't really know what their goal is, it may just be an isolated incident, only time will tell. Thoughts on this?

Why? Well, mainly just to see how it shakes things up and what works and what doesn't. [Here is a post currently in contest mode, if you're curious to see it in action](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19n00s/if_you_were_task_to_redesign_the_human_body_what/) [Edit: not anymore. We turned it off now]. [To see what it looks like **AFTER** contest mode is disabled, go here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19itfu/how_do_i_tell_my_kids_their_mother_is_going_to_die/). So, here are our preliminary results based on the first thread that we tried this with. 

[Raw data](http://pastebin.com/GHbQ0yR7)

* Column A: The number of votes on top-level comments on [How do I tell my kids their mother is going to die?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19itfu/how_do_i_tell_my_kids_their_mother_is_going_to_die/), **with** contest mode enabled.

* Column B: The number of votes on top-level comments on [In 2008, I scraped a guy's bumper, left a note and never heard back from him. Today, four years later, he called and asked me to pay for the repairs. Should I pay for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wrni8/in_2008_i_scraped_a_guys_bumper_left_a_note_and/), picked for being a similar type of post (asking for advice), with a similar number of net upvotes.

* Column C: The number of votes on top-level comments on [Hotel staff of Reddit: Whats the strangest request you've had from a guest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19hy4x/hotel_staff_of_reddit_whats_the_strangest_request/), picked for being from the same day as the contest mode thread, and had a similar number of net upvotes. 

* Column D: The number of child comments on top level comments on [How do I tell my kids their mother is going to die?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19itfu/how_do_i_tell_my_kids_their_mother_is_going_to_die/)

* Column E: The number of child comments on top level comments on [In 2008, I scraped a guy's bumper, left a note and never heard back from him. Today, four years later, he called and asked me to pay for the repairs. Should I pay for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wrni8/in_2008_i_scraped_a_guys_bumper_left_a_note_and/)

* Column F: The number of child comments on top level comments on [Hotel staff of Reddit: Whats the strangest request you've had from a guest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19hy4x/hotel_staff_of_reddit_whats_the_strangest_request/)

So, what does all of this tell us?

[Here's graph #1](http://i.imgur.com/kSqxMDT.png)

Most significant, and expected with the randomization feature, is that the level of votes on comments is a *lot* steadier and more distributed. There is a spread of 568 points (652-84) between Comment #1 and Comment #100. But on the other two, there is a spread of 2869 (2872-3) and 2209 (2217-8). This shows that *more* comments are getting attention, instead of a *few* comments getting *a lot* of attention. But, as you can see from the numbers at the bottom, the total number of upvotes on the contest mode thread were hardly different from the total number of the non-contest mode thread from that same day. So, the upvotes were around the same in total, but more equally distributed. 

The vote seems to be much more indicative of the quality of the post (rather than how early it was posted), given that over the span of a day with random sorting, comments of similar age would all receive a similar amount of views. 

[Here's graph #2](http://i.imgur.com/d3xNaOX.png)

This one just shows the #of child comments, and you can't see much because it is very skewed by the first few comments of the normal 2 posts. 

[But if we take out the first 3 comments](http://i.imgur.com/ZPplw1P.png), acknowledging that they are very high in the 2 normal posts, we can see that there is no consistent pattern in the contest mode thread (consistent with randomization) whereas with the two normal threads, the level of child comments peters out significantly down the thread. The largest difference, however, is the total number of child comments. The number of child comments in the contest mode was drastically lower than either of the non-contest mode posts. This shows that people were generally not expanding the child comments and replying to them.

**Conclusions**
---

#1. Contest mode is **BAD** for:

* Users who simply reply to already-posted comments instead of posting their own. This practice, threadjacking, attempts to get attention and popularity for ones own comments by simply attaching it to something that is already upvoted. Contest mode makes this completely ineffective because these users are unable to judge which comments will be most popular, and because it hides the child comments by default. 

* Readers who only wish to read the most upvoted answers (or some other sorting method, like ""old"" or ""controversial""), instead of a mix of answers.

* Users who do want to read child comments must expand them manually

* Responses normally hidden by downvotes will still be seen. This is good for certain threads in which the topic may be very one-sided (thus, contest mode prevents a 'circlejerk' around the one popular opinion) but bad for threads with trolls or just plain dumb answers. 

#2. Contest mode is **GOOD** for:

* people who post after the first hour or so. Their comments have just as good of a chance to be seen as something that was there in the first minute. In fact, many of the top comments in the contest mode thread had been posted later, but still got the attention that they deserved. 

* Users who do not like reading replies have child comments automatically hidden

* Accurately rewarding the quality of the post, instead of simply when the poster made it to the thread.

* Rewarding the top-level comments that actually answer the question, instead of the tangent replies, puns, and jokes that usually pepper the child comments section.

Contest Mode could have a few uses in askreddit, including but not limited to:

* Mods could enable contest mode on posts at the request of the OP

* Mods could enable contest mode on certain types of posts (Ex. Enable it on ""story"" type posts but disable it on posts asking for advice)

* Mods could enable contest mode on new posts and disable it after a certain amount of time (2 or 3 hours, maybe), which would level the playing field for comments submitted in the first few hours while still enabling users to sort the comments as they please for the vast majority of the time the post is on the front page.

It makes reddit more interesting.,laofmoonster,184,43,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/mqp0v/subscribe_to_subreddits_you_disagree_with_it/,"I moderate [r/GaryJohnson](http://www.reddit.com/r/GaryJohnson/), for people who want him to be president. And I must confess, I don't like the subreddit much at all. Reddit's structure is pretty bad for advocacy. When you all agree, there's not so much to talk about, even with 700+ subscribers.

When everyone agrees, there is no *dialectic*. The [dialectical method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic), like the scientific method, is a way of reaching knowledge. It relies on people who disagree but make an *honest* attempt to reach a middle ground. And it doesn't even matter if other people are not open to disagreement, as long as *you* are.

Which brings me to my argument, that you *should* subscribe to reddits that support a worldview that you disagree. Even if you continue to disagree, you can better qualify your disagreement, or better understand the context of the belief. For example, as an atheist, it would be easy for me to say ""I don't believe in God, why would I subscribe to r/Christianity?"" But then I wouldn't learn that [Satan doesn't actually rule hell](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/mq5c1/serious_question_about_the_devil_and_hell_i_am_an/).

*""Of course Satan doesn't rule Hell, it doesn't exist, you just said you were atheist!""*

A suspension of disbelief makes the browsing experience of r/Christianity more rewarding. If you reduce the scope of Reddit to ""I agree/I disagree"" you are missing out. In the dialectic, you may change your mind. Outside of the dialectic, just consider it storytelling.

r/atheism is what happens when you get 270,000 redditors who agree into the same place: image macros and facebook screenshots that *discourage* mental growth. Because, why think of new anti-theistic arguments, we've already found the right argument for you, given it to you in rage-comic portions? It tells you the correct face to make so you know what emotion to feel! r/Christianity is less than 20k people, and seems to have healthy discussions with disagreements worth discussing.

Another subreddit I subscribe to is [r/new_right](http://www.reddit.com/r/new_right). It is a different kind of conservatism, more concerned about ethno-nationalism than Jesus or Austrian Economics. Think r/FoodForThought meets r/white_rights. As a non-White American who believes in the ""American dream"" of a class-blind meritocracy, I have much to disagree with. But I don't comment much, because for the most part, I'm there to read and listen, not to argue. Are they racist? I bet a lot of them are, and I've tagged them in RES. But that's only a reason to unsubscribe if you're still in the mindset of ""if you're wrong. there's nothing left for me to see here"".

It seems to me that artificially fuzzing the downvotes to such a large degree, particularly on a submission/comment that seems so utterly undeserving of the perceived volume of downvotes, can leave users without knowledge of the inner workings of reddit and vote fuzzing with a really negative outlook on the reddit community as a whole.

Which begs the question; why are up/downvotes even publicly listed if they are completely inaccurate due to fuzzing?  Why not just list the total net positive votes?

All that listing these fuzzed downvotes does is elicit a false sense of transparency which only adds to the uninformed user's negative perception of the reddit community.

There were threads discussing gun laws, religion and politics in a completely different way than what we have here on reddit. They did not have a winner and loser where the loser was censored and given a negative score to obfuscate the actual argument. They weren't punished either for stating their unpopular idea so they didn't fear to say what they actually wanted to say.

Now I'm not saying 4chan is better by any means (probably 50% of the posts there were by trolls), but it did get me thinking about how reddit's subreddit division helps resonate the community's opinion back upon itself without getting a criticism. This creates a situation where all users are censored to conflicting ideas and are rewarded for following the same idea as the masses. Your opinion is created in the first days you enter the site and choose subreddits.

As an example, I don't think I have ever seen an argument in favor of Christianity here on reddit even though /r/christianity has 37.000 subscribers. I'm pretty sure they have been there, but since they get censored by reddit's comment sorting algorithms I can't see them without expanding the comment (which I'm not supposed to do really, as the downvote feature is for trolls and spam only.)

I invite anyone to go take a quick peek at http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/new/

You can see each entry has at least 10 more downvotes than upvotes (other than the two very newest submissions).  And this has been happening for days on end.  It hasn't totally crippled the subreddit as some content is climbing out from under the downvotes (some has to because *something* has to be on the front page of /r/atheism), but it does seem to have partially crippled it.  Reddit is logarithmic in nature and the first 10-30 minutes of a submission are critical in determining how high a submission will climb.  

How can moderators fight this type of coordinated downvoting in the new queue?

The domains are monetarily valuable because they contain keywords or misspellings of popular websites.

Subreddits, like domains, can be registered by anyone, even a throwaway account. Subreddits are not financially valuable, but people can still register them for reasons that the system may have not intended. For example, /r/Stormfront is currently a satire of the white nationalist website of that name. On the other side, /r/Antiracism, /r/SPLC (Southern Poverty Law Center), and /r/HBD (human biodiversity) are moderated by mayonesa, who has been called a Neo-Nazi (which I don't believe, but that's a discussion for another time).

There are less insidious problems with the system, too. Sometimes people find subreddits by guessing the name. For example, I tried typing in /r/socialpsychology and /r/sociobiology. But both of these are private, and no alternatives exist. ~~I can't even message the mods to ask them the status~~ [redtaboo says you can](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/12gyla/subreddit_parking_and_other_problems_with_the/c6uy8nl). Maybe the mods are inactive. If I wanted to, I could create alternatives with different names. But unless I was willing to advertise them heavily (which I am not), it would be difficult to grow them, because people like me who just type in /r/socialpsychology could not find it.

Right now, the only ways to gain control of a subreddit is to ask the mods, or if the subreddit is abandoned, ask /r/redditrequest. The process feels a little flimsy. And theoretically, I could register 500 subreddits, set them to private, and as long as I log in every couple of months, nobody can force me out, even if they know that I registered it.

Event-Based News Production on a Social News Site, Reddit**, here: [http://alexleavitt.com/papers/2013_DRAFT_reddit_sandy_newsproduction.pdf](http://alexleavitt.com/papers/2013_DRAFT_reddit_sandy_newsproduction.pdf) [PDF]

There's been a fair amount of coverage on how Reddit has been used for breaking news coverage, particularly around the Aurora shooting [coverage](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/wv8t1/comprehensive_timeline_aurora_massacre/) (see, for instance, the New York Times' [How Reddit Scooped the Press on the Aurora Shootings](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/reddit-aurora-shooter-aff/)). We wanted to examine how a social news site could produce news around a particular event, and luckily an interesting case study emerged when the /r/sandy subreddit was created to curate information about Hurricane Sandy.

The paper covers two topics: 

* what kind of content emerged as ""most relevant"" (looking at the top-1000 highest-scored posts to the subreddit)
* how mixed moderation (democratic voting + top-down actions by moderators) affected what content became relevant

tl;dr, there were three general takeaways:

* /r/sandy users were more ""experienced"" than average news-sharing users on Reddit (ie., /r/worldnews), but this ultimately didn't matter in what kind of content was shared
* reported news content (from actual news sources) appeared significantly less than other types of content, such as perspective-based media, human-interest content, and humor
* almost all types of content were more likely to receive upvotes than reported news content

We'd love to see comments and criticisms on this draft so we can continue improving it!

Right away, I notice a few things that stand out. First of all, why do the subscriber counts vary so much between the default subreddits? /r/todayilearned gained 34,629 subscribers in the last week. By comparison, /r/atheism gained only 20,944. That's a difference of 13,685 users. Since users are automatically subscribed to all 20 default subreddits when they create an account, this means that a very large percentage of users are opting to stay subscribed to subreddits like /r/todayilearned, /r/funny, and /r/bestof, while unsubscribing from subreddits such as /r/atheism, /r/politics and /r/AdviceAnimals.

Who doesn't like to learn new things (TIL), be entertained (funny), and read really great comments / discover new subreddits (bestof)? Not surprisingly, the three slowest growing subreddits are the most specialized - not everyone is an atheist, not everyone is a liberal, and not everyone enjoys memes. In fact, apparently a large percentage of new users are none of those things.

What else can we extrapolate from this data?

Edit: Several people have asked what I meant by ""new account purge."" I apologize, I should have either phrased it differently, or explained more in the OP.

[Like this.](http://i.imgur.com/8g59q.png) It would do a lot to alleviate those concerns if such subreddits only accepted links that were viewed in that form, even though people could still find their way to the actual source if they really want.

**How could this be done, technically?**

1. **Link to screenshots.** Well, that's easy, but it removes our ability to collapse/expand subthreads, and it's impossible to see comments that weren't on the submitter's screen or were added after submission. Plus it's tricky and slightly time-consuming to make a good screenshot. So this is just frustrating for everyone involved. But it already exists as an option, and perhaps someone could come up with a way to make it less frustrating, so it's worth mentioning. /u/redditbots has already automated this in a realistically good way, but I don't know how complicated it would be for a human to use the same pipeline.
2. **Use an external website that duplicates reddit threads.** Again, /u/redditbots has already automated it. Although ~~the collapse/expand buttons~~ and [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) don't work, I prefer it over the screenshots. And again, I don't know how practical it is for humans to do the same thing the bot does.
3. **Build it into [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com)**. In principle, it would be a lot simpler than other things RES already does very well. You'd need to tell RES when to do it (which could be as easy as adding ""#ro"" to the end of URLs). But of course it only affects people who use RES.
4. **CSS trickery?** We already know subreddit stylesheets can hide the vote arrows etc., but they would need some way to do it conditionally depending on where a viewer just came from. I suspect this is not possible, but I'm listing it here in case someone smarter than me can think of a way.
5. **Cookie magic?** reddit already has a read-only mode: it's when you're logged out. Maybe through some sort of wizardry, special URLs could be created that bring the user to a view of the target thread where they're logged out of reddit, except without also logging them out of all the other pages they're viewing? Again, I'm an HTTP muggle, so I'm just proposing it in case someone else knows how.
6. **Request it from the admins.** Again, it could be triggered very easily by adding ""#ro"" to the URL, but the admins have lots of things to do that are more important than this, so good luck. (EDIT: FWIW, [I suggested it in /r/ideasfortheadmins.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/10kqn0/readonly_viewing_mode_for_comment_pages/))

---

**How could this be enforced easily?**

1. **Use [AutoModerator](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/onl2u/automoderator_a_bot_for_automating/) to remove non-read-only links** and politely inform submitters how to do it right. Shouldn't be hard, assuming the URL is what designates a link as read-only. (EDIT: see e.g. [what AutoModerator does for /r/bestof](http://i.imgur.com/UdBBI.png))
2. **Use CSS to replace the Submit button with a read-only link submitter.** At least the CSS side of this is easy (e.g. /r/atheism), but there needs to be an interface for it to point to.
3. **Use CSS to replace all links with read-only versions.** Not sure if possible/practical.

I didn't really think about the perks it brought, I bought it to support Reddit.  It expired two days ago, and due to temporary shortness of funds, I have yet to renew it.  Since then, however, my Reddit experience has changed dramatically.  And not necessarily for the worse.

I had been subscribed to a large number of sub-reddits^1 (somewhere in the 80's), and my homepage was always a bit of a crap-shoot, but mostly, the smaller subs got drowned out, even if I aggressively went through and hid everything from the bigger subs that I was subscribed to.  I didn't think much of this - after all smaller subs have less traffic.  Most of the posts on my front-page were in karma triple-figures, and quite a few were in quadrule figures.  Even Never-Ending-Reddit took three or four pages to get me to double-digit posts.

However since Gold expired, I am now seeing a really interesting mix from some of the smaller subs that I'm subscribed to.  It turns out that my assumptions about some of those smaller subs being low-traffic were off.  There's lots of great content that I've been missing out on.  I'm missing some of the larger subs that I've subscribed to, but I'm assuming that once I renew my Gold subscription, I'll either re-subscribe, or I'll realise I don't miss them.  

Now I know that I could set up lots of customised widgets with RES, and I've dabbled in that, but it's not intuitive, and it doesn't behave the way I expect.  It's not necessarily a failing of RES, though.  

My questions for ToR are these:

1) Has anyone else had a similar experience?

2) Would it be worth making a submission in /r/IdeasForTheAdmins for a feature that allows you give additional weight to smaller subs that you've subscribed to?  I think this would allow you tweak to an even larger degree what you see on your personalised home-page.  Does this belong on RES?

Thanks, and apologies for what seems like it will be a wall of text.

##About TheoryOfReddit

 &gt; Theory of Reddit is a mildly navel-gazing space for inquiring into what makes Reddit communities work and what we in a community can do to help make it better. 

Please keep this in mind at all times, we are not the to go subreddit to [complain about stuff](/r/circlebroke) or [talk about drama](/r/subredditdrama).  **Be constructive!** If you perceive a issue that annoys you that is alright, but when visiting TheoryOfreddit you should be prepared to think in solutions, not problems. 

##The wiki

**Almost the [entire wiki is editable](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/wiki_protocol) by our regular users!** Regulars are any user with an account older than 90 days and who has accumulated at least 50 subreddit karma. 

  - We do welcome user contributions since a lot of knowledge is gathered here but also lost since it is hard to search for. With the wiki we aim to fix that and every helping hand is welcome!



##On moderation 

   -  We are still ""TheoryOfReddit"" so questions without theories will be removed. 
   -  Removed posts can always be found in our [public modlog](/r/theoryofmoderation) and if possible a better suited subreddit will be suggested.
   -  Unsure how a good /r/theoryofreddit post would look like, but eager to make one? Just read through the sidebar and use every item as a checklist. [There is also a guide to be found on the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/submission_guide). A good look at [our top submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/top/) and their common elements can be very useful in forming a general idea about this.
   -  We can't mention it enough, **posts that include things only the admins can do will be removed.** /r/ideasfortheadmins is the subreddit for posts that require admin intervention. 
        - This does include ""what if"" scenarios that still require admin intervention to be executable.
   - We do actively remove comments that are bigoted, racist, and otherwise derailing. Keep this in mind while commenting.
   - [Bigoted and racist usernames will be banned](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1066cx/we_have_a_new_sidebar_rule_usernames_containing/).

At this point the thread has [spiraled out of control](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/) with Harrelson's comments being downvoted to oblivion. You can see the answers he DID give [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/iamwoodyharrelson) (and hit context to get the question).

There is also a circlejerk-type [request thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9u8t/ama_request_the_intern_who_suggested_woody_should/) looking for the intern who came up with the idea in the first place.

This has obviously not helped the movie at all. Many people are commenting that they will boycott the movie and Harrelson in general. My question is whether or not this will curb the influx of celebrity AMAs, for better or worst.

To be fair, these AMAs were giving a lot of attention to Reddit from other sites who linked to them. I would be very curious to see the traffic stats to these celebrity AMAs from outside links.

I personally think the celebrity AMAs are hit or miss, depending on whether or not the celebrity ""understands"" Reddit and the internet in general. Harrelson obviously did not. It is given that most celebrities that come to Reddit are promoting a movie or show. Does this mean that a celebrity cannot make an AMAAM (ask me anything about movie) without getting into possibly offensive questions? I ask this because the first question that Harrelson answers, and what possibly started the downturn, was a Redditor accusing him of taking a [friend's virginity without calling afterward.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/c3nlalf?context=3). 

Anyways, very interesting stuff.

Trying to view the comments from outside of the subreddit leads to an *interesting* page:

The page is titled ""bummer"" and says:

# What is _takedowns?

\/r\/_takedowns is a private subreddit and is presumably admin-controlled. There is a config file in reddit's code ([link to github](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/example.ini#L388)) which says this is a subreddit used for DMCA takedowns. Those lines were added 3 years ago in [this commit](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/e6838895e04fd683ea6477b2dba19e889681edb8#r2/example.ini), which means this functionality has been around for a while. I assume the purpose of _takedowns is to completely remove a post from the site so it is not visible in user history or by directly-linking to the post.  This might be because ""removing"" a post (such as moderators do) does not prevent people with a direct link to the post from viewing the content. That way when copyright holders ask for a post to be removed and go back to the URL to check if it's been removed, they will see it's gone and won't need to follow-up with the admins.

# Implications

This implies that the admins have the ability to move posts between subreddits.

Check out [this AskReddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15pw0h/what_is_the_snobbiest_subreddit_you_have_ventured/) entitled ""What is the snobbiest subreddit you have ventured onto?"" If you scroll down past a lot of the joke comments, you'll see that there seems to be a lot of disdain for any subreddit whose users have a more cultivated taste for something many people enjoy. 

Interestingly, a lot of people seem to actively promote mediocrity/popular opinion about a subject, and those people with more expert opinions are labeled as pretentious snobs. There also seems to be a lot of skepticism about the very idea that people might actually enjoy the things they talk about, as if the people in /r/beer actually prefer Bud Light but are just too proud to admit it, and so they pretend to like fancy beers. 

By contrast, the ""hivemind"" opinion on science and technology generally demands deference to experts, and rightly so. Creationists, astrologists, and supporters of alternative medicine are condemned. But on other matters, deference to experts is derided as elitist. 

I guess I just find it interesting that so many people seem genuinely *offended* by the idea that the quality of something is not determined democratically. Apparently, /r/food is elitist because a lot of people like their steaks cooked to hell; /r/beer is elitist because Bud Light is the most popular beer; /r/coffee is elitist because Folgers is liked by many; /r/malefashionadvice is elitist (or even gay!) because they don't like cargo shorts and band T-shirts; /r/wicked_edge is elitist because they don't believe in electric razors and disposable cartridges. 

I could go on and on. Now, it's obvious to me why people might not like snobs in general; after all, for better or for worse, Bud Light is really popular, and so it's pretty annoying if someone goes to a party and makes fun of all the people drinking Bud Light (and this is coming from a self-professed beer snob). What I am confused about, though, is why people seem to expect that the /r/beer should promote Bud Light and /r/food should encourage dining at Applebee's. 

To me, it seems completely obvious that the people who have sought out a subreddit for a specialized topic would have more cultivated tastes in regard to that topic compared to the general population. And yet this notion seems to anger a lot of reddit users. Thoughts?

Suddenly it occurred to me that this had an uncanny similarity to Mildred (the wife of the protagonist if you don't recall) and her interactive soap opera that she played with all day on her floor-to-ceiling television screens.  You may recall that Montag at one point has an outburst at her about her wasting all her time with people she doesn't even know playing out silly scenarios.  In fact, the whole book is essentially a condemnation of people losing their humanity, partly due to what were essentially technological [skinner boxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber).  Having taken a step back, it appears to me that people can easily start fixating on particular things online and become immersed within what we jokingly refer to as a hivemind but which can be more interestingly defined as a [filter bubble](http://blog.ted.com/2011/05/02/beware-online-filter-bubbles-eli-pariser-on-ted-com/), and with topic groupings and the capability to be easily validated by the hordes it seems to match Mildred's situation quite well.  

So, to bring this into focus, my discussion topic is:  What role do you think reddit, or even social media as a whole if you like, are destined to play in this context?

I then submitted to /r/atheism.

Having looked back on it, I realized that the essay was terrible--and that the act of submitting it to /r/atheism was one of the 'ragiest' and 'cringiest' thing I've ever done. So, hoping to gain karma, I put [an image summary about it](http://i.imgur.com/d8JIGm1.png) together and submitted it to /r/rage and /r/cringepics.  
Naturally, I didn't want people to know *I* was the one who originally wrote the essay--so I titled it in third-person: ""Future neck-beard youngster submits their 'logical' essay to /r/atheism.""

Users were quick to catch on, despite my misleading title, that I was the one who had written the essay. At this point, the thread could split two ways: they could all forgive me and joke about it, or they could turn into elitist assholes and insult me for no particular reason.

The threads *did* split both ways: the [one on](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1ca8z3/future_neckbeard_youngster_submits_their_logical/) /r/cringepics became forgiving and teasing, while the [one on](http://www.reddit.com/r/rage/comments/1ca94t/future_neckbeard_youngster_submits_their_logical/) /r/rage (ironically?) became the enraged one.

To be perfectly honest, I did skew the reaction in each thread. In /r/rage, I was *slightly* more defensive at first than in /r/cringepics.

{inspired to post by http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/r8b0a/sleeper_accounts/, I have been noticing it for about 2 days}

Have you ever wondered why there are so many reposts? Who would do that, and why? I have put on my Science Hat and delved deep into the black market of votes/accounts/proxys and whatnot and have an answer: Money. Yep, it is that simple.

How it works, in a nutshell: Someone downloads bunch of older popular/viral videos from youtube, uploads it in his account, gets YT partnership and then makes &gt;1$ per 1000 views.
But, wait a minute, what does that have to do with Reddit, you might ask. r/videos has over 1M registered users and another few millions lurkers and all you need is to get your video on frontpage for massive profit. But Knights of new are brave guardians, they would never allow blatant repost to get through! They are trying, but they are fighting with upvote bots, [exhibit 1](http://i.imgur.com/XfqPl.jpg): 1 default upvote+30 bots vs 4 Knights on blatant repost.

Can you provide more evidence/insight into how exactly this works?
Sure, but at some points I am just speculating, because the Reddit bot detection algorithm isn't public, so take it with a grain of salt.
There are 2 main perpetrators : bot farmers and YT uploaders.
Bot farmer rents serverhosting for a few dollars a month on a few dozen servers to make hundreds or even thousands of accounts with different IP, which are either sold or rented for upvotes. This is quite a big investment, in hundreds $, but  returns are insane.[ exhibit2](http://i.imgur.com/OrUOD.jpg), enough said. (all is scripted)

SPECULATION: bot detection takes into account age and comment+post upvotes, so it is better to repost a few pictures to either r/pics or r/funny or to make few neutral comments like ""this"" ""haha"" ""me too"" in a few threads to avoid detection.
semiproof: if you look into new for these subreddits, you might see +10/0 or +30/0 pattern on new accounts or even in gonewild. There are posts ""Ill show boobs for 200 upvotes"" with pictures stolen from pornsites/4chan. [exhibit3](http://i.imgur.com/TKUaXh.jpg) [NSFW]
/SPECULATION

So someone made shitton of ""valid"" accounts, but why? 
Here come YT uploaders who rents these for, a boost in the new queue to get their video to the frontpage and then profit from adverts on YT. Just look on most upvoted/ curently hot submission in videos: www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/r6lq2/huge_sewer_explosion_shit_happens_literally/ this posts leads to a YT account with 2 videos frontpaged in the last week and about 2M views, or 100k views/video. (Majority of them were at some point frontpaged)
And there are dozens of such accounts, my estimates are that 5 or even 10% of the frontpage is for-profit reposts, just look into new and you'll find a few.

How is it currently handled and what can be done better?
All moderators do is either ban the account which submitted it (pure new accounts, no big deal) or auto bot detection might do something (not sure) but obviously it isn't enough. My suggestions (r/video doesn't have have self posts, that's why I post here+ I expect some discussion):

 -Instead of banning worthless accounts flag these videos and ask users to report them on YT. This scares spammers because YT accounts with decent view counts are valuable. 

-Improve bot detecting algorithm to look for cliques with similar taste and suspiciously similar timing, especially in /new. 30 accounts voting in 5 minutes on a 1/0 submission is easy to detect and flag. Once these groups are detected, keep watching them and let them ""poison"" other submissions instead of instabanning.

(I tested this technique yesterday in a smaller subreddit. My blatantly reposted video got 100 views in about 30 minutes, even before leaving the 1 hour whatever-the-nursery-is-called. In r/videos this could be 2k views in 30 minutes or tens of thousands of views in a few hours, which is consistent with the view counts on these spammers accounts)

I'm one of the mods of AskScience, and consequently I'm also a scientist. As such, I tend toward data. One thing that we've been wanting to do for a while is track the number of deletes on a particular thread versus some other traffic stats. We're trying to figure out if the number of comments we delete is because particular topics attract off topic comments or if our number of deleted posts is strictly a function of the number of people who see a topic.

We recently provided glyserinesoul with some traffic stats for AskScience. 

Here are the imgur links:

Unfortunately, with all the stuff thats happened in the past couple days I haven't had the time to check to see if a correlation exists. So here is what I would love for you to do for me: For all the days that we have traffic stats, could you guys find all the threads that have more than some threshold level of comments (say 20?) and just count the number of deleted posts on that page?

If you could drop them into a Google Spreadsheet with the number of upvotes and the number of comments that the thread has that'd be nice too but I'm not going to push my luck. =)

I've been following ToR for a while, and I know the affection you guys feel for us. I promise, we're not going to let AskScience go to crap because of this default subreddit thing. We've taken some measures, and we're working on more.

### Traffic stats

ToR had three comments prominently featured in /r/bestof in the last month - [[1]](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/14vz3i/reddit_ceo_uyishan_makes_a_promise_we_will_not/), [[2]](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/15h73a/kleinbl00_discusses_the_climate_change_that_is/),  [[3]](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/15kb6l/reddit_has_the_best_format_for_discussion_of_any/), at +1970, +1959, and +1473. One would expect that most people would discover this subreddit after the first post and subscribe then, and the second and the third post wouldn't bring as many new subscribers.

Stats:

* [Part 1: Graphs](http://i.imgur.com/dhzAl.png)
* [Part 2: Tables](http://i.imgur.com/g3NnQ.png)
* [Part 3: Capture from stattit.com, better shows new subscribers in the last two days](http://i.imgur.com/OYMWH.png)

However, these graphs show that we gained 300 new subscribers from the first post, and ~1,300 new subscribers from last two posts (mostly the second one).


### Moderator stats

A common wisdom says that in any given popular subreddit, few moderators are most active, and the rest barely have any mod actions. In other words, mod actions tend to follow exponential distribution. Let's see if this is true with ToR data for the last two months since the current mod team stabilized.

[Main graph](http://i.imgur.com/JfpZc.png) shows (1) comment removals, (2) submission removals, (3) distinguish actions, and (4) exponential distribution of current mods. These are normalized and mapped into [0,1] interval, so values of Y axis are meaningless here.

Note that three types of mod actions were sorted independently, so X axis does not actually represent individual mods - some may be more active with submission removals, some may be more active with post removals. But I think that combining all of them into a single number is meaningless, as mod actions are incomparable.

As you can see, data indeed confirms that mod actions follow exponential distribution, at least in this subreddit.

Three more graphs that show actual values:

* [Remove comment](http://i.imgur.com/wnmrK.png)

* [Remove submission](http://i.imgur.com/4G5q4.png)

* [Distinguish](http://i.imgur.com/aSALH.png)

[Table](http://i.imgur.com/Xrgh5.png) that was used as a source for graphs. One mod is missing from it because they had no actions at all. AutoModerator was removed as well (5 approved submissions). Some actions like ban user are not shown because they could lead to easy re-identification, but there were total 14 bans (mostly because of bestof'd threads) in last two months.

1330589639.0,127,self.TheoryOfReddit,qcp5j,A quick analysis of Neil Tyson's most recent AMA.  What should Reddit's approach be to the celebrity AMA in general?,nicotinedreams,143,16,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/qcp5j/a_quick_analysis_of_neil_tysons_most_recent_ama/,"Earlier tonight, Neil deGrasse Tyson did an AMA that coincided with various talk-show appearances promoting his new book.  In an hour and 8 minutes, he answered 42 questions, which comes to an average of about 97 seconds spent on each answer.  He plugged his book, ""Space Chronicles"", once during the AMA, and only in response to a user that [mentioned that he bought the book after asking his question](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qccer/i_am_neil_degrasse_tyson_ask_me_anything/c3wgd18).  At the time of this post, the AMA brought in almost 22,000 upvotes and 3,593 points, making it the most popular AMA of the month.

As the [Woody Harrelson AMA fiasco](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/) made painfully clear, Reddit AMA's are now on the radar of publicists and celebrities, who seek exposure to Reddit's large and unique demographic.  From a celebrity's standpoint, the AMA format is ideal in many ways.  It's free, it doesn't require any on-screen appearances, and it can be done from anywhere at virtually any time of day.  On the other hand, the AMA never was and never will be a 5-minute talk show appearance.  Good AMA's take time to solicit questions, read and type out answers, which are then permanently available for anyone to read.  There's no witty talk-show host to entertain and fill time, and no close-up on the book/movie to close the session.  And most importantly, the fans are the ones writing and upvoting the questions, unfiltered by any publicist or producer.  A celebrity can and should be prepared to be *asked anything*, up to including questions about taking a high school senior's virginity at a party that one time.  However, despite all these drawbacks, celebrities continue to come to Reddit to do AMA's promoting their work.

But if both Neil Tyson's and Woody Harrelson's AMA's were promotional in nature, what made one so much more successful than the other?  After all, one could argue that averaging 97 seconds per answer (including time to read through questions and select ones to answer) doesn't really seem like enough time to really answer questions thoughtfully.  Those of us who have sunk hours into even a single post or comment can attest to this.  Furthermore, not all of the ""questions"" Neil chose to answer were even questions at all.  So why was the AMA such a hit?

I think that there are several reasons.

1. He revealed insights into his personal philosophy on life, and he did so in a succinct and easily digestible manner.  While the same insights may or may not appear in his books and publications, having a straightforward and insightful answer to a fan's question made the insight seem all the more inspiring.

2. He chose a variety of questions.  Neil commented on topics from politics and science to personal heroes and even [fictional cartoon heroes](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qccer/i_am_neil_degrasse_tyson_ask_me_anything/c3wh6uo?context=3).  By doing this he implicitly answered a lot of other questions about himself such as his interests and random cultural elements that he's paid attention to, like old TV shows about crime fighting half-man-half-sharks.

3. He didn't just answer questions, he joked and even gave the internet equivalent of a [high five](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qccer/i_am_neil_degrasse_tyson_ask_me_anything/c3wgcqp?context=3).  By doing this he showed that he was engaging with his fans as peers, giving the AMA a more intimate feel.

4. He was honest.  This one is technically hard to prove, but I think it's safe to say that in 97 seconds it would be hard to fake some of the posts that Neil made in his AMA.  

5. He didn't shamelessly promote his book.  As I mentioned before, he only mentioned Space Chronicles in response to a fan's question that included the fact that the fan bought the book already.  This shows an understanding that the primary purpose of the AMA is for readers to learn more about the person doing the AMA.  Any other benefits, like better rapport with fans, or increased publicity for a new book/movie, can only come secondarily to this.

That's all I can think of right now.  What do you guys think?  What should we expect from celebrity AMA's for them to be successful, and what are some dealbreakers?  I think a discussion about this would not only help those celebrities who are considering doing AMA's in the future (and may be afraid of pulling a Rampart), but also help us to figure out what exactly we want from these AMA's.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_qcp5j,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/qcp5j/a_quick_analysis_of_neil_tysons_most_recent_ama/,

In this case, /r/atheism is dealing with a problem that seems to plague reddit as a whole; the move from articles and long-form thoughts to things that can be consumed in a matter of seconds.

I think one of the things we've agreed upon here is that short-form content tends to have a competitive advantage in comparison with long-form.  Something that 1/100 subscribers has read will always be outpaced by something that 1/10 subscribers has read, all else being equal (and making the assumption that people aren't upvoting content on the basis of the title alone).

Adding on to that, we also see a feedback effect going on.  People who don't like to see the short-form stuff will leave, and people who like the short-form stuff will come in, until all the long-form content has been pushed out.

So that's all pretty much ""known"" stuff.  How is r/Atheism reacting to this discussion?

The [top post](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/i6sro/seriously_ratheism_lets_not_allow_this_subreddit/c21dabq) on the main thread right now makes the claim that atheism is basically a ""solved problem"".  So there's no need for long-form educationally oriented stuff.  This is a fairly good explanation, but it doesn't explain why ""sharing personal stories"" takes the form of rage comics.

The other [point](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/i6sro/seriously_ratheism_lets_not_allow_this_subreddit/c21e1x5) which people always make in discussions like this is that the community decides on the content, and the proper stance to take when you don't like something is to downvote and move on.

The main post in question is [Seriously, r/Atheism? Let's not allow this subreddit to waste away like so many others](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/i6sro/seriously_ratheism_lets_not_allow_this_subreddit/), but there have been follow-ups [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/i70rp/if_you_dont_like_the_front_page_covered_in_comics/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/i7a5p/why_i_am_not_bothered_by_the_volume_of_comics_and/).

Reposted submissions happen so often on reddit, and yet, many times they are accepted, even deemed by many users as good because ""new users might not have seen the link already."" However, and quite hypocritically in my opinion, reposted comments in these reposts are met with harsh criticism and dislike, even though the same exact thing could be said about the comments themselves - especially those that are helpful and link to more information.

The bot does zero error checking. If the top comment from the top submission was deleted, the bot would still comment ""[deleted]."" In fact, some of its comments are the past week have been humorous due to these small ""errors.""

The design of the bot was simple. Every 5 minutes it ran and collected the top 25 submissions from top/hour. It only had two rules: 1) ignore /r/AdviceAnimals and 2) ignore all self-posts. If the submission didn't violate one of those rules, it was scanned through karmadecay to see if it was a repost. If it was, the top comment from the top previous submission was stolen verbatim. The bot checked to make sure that it didn't comment in the same submission twice.

Over the past week, I made 3 original comments on the account, which netted a total of approximately 500 karma. Two of those comments alluded to the bot being a bot and were made [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/x9r6v/iama_pornstar_april_oneil_ama/c5kgahv). Every other comment was provided by users of the site in the form of stolen reposted comments.

I am stopping the bot now because the owner of karmadecay.com, /u/metabeing, asked me to use his API in lieu of scraping HTML. Unfortunately, his API isn't nearly as robust as I would have liked, and he blocked the bot from scraping, which I don't blame him for because it's his site to do with as he pleases. In less than 8 days, the account went from brand new to 18,952 comment karma (including the 500 from my 3 original comments).

Reddit is consumed as a flow of information. We expect reddit to continually change and our interest in reddit is observing the change each day (new posts). Wikipedia on the other hand is for storing information and we value the stock of information it contains, not the flow of new information. 

This has important implications for the difference in the economics of these two forms, but also in how we interact with it.

The flow of reddit is like a non-durable consumption good as a hamburger. I eat today's hamburger and have to get a new one to consume tomorrow. 

Reddit has little value as a stock. The information is already on the web, and because comments tend to die out after a few days, there is little value in these after the thread is old. In order to keep consuming reddit, noel information must flow into it. Therefore, reddits value is that it provides a focal point for users, rather than having assets that are valuable.

",Maxion,163,41,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/10mdle/should_reddit_limit_how_often_you_can_post_right/,"Recently there has been a trend towards users either manually or by using bots posting content at a very high frequency. Some have done this at burst rates up to 100 submissions per hour. It's very hard to believe anyone could be manually finding content that fast, entering titles and submitting.

I see a bit of a problem with this. If enough bots/users start to post at a very high frequency their submissions will start to drown out submissions made by regular users. The submissions made by these high frequency users would start to dominate what most people see in the /r/all/new/ and in subreddit specific new queues, essentially drowning out submissions made by regular users. This could cause a similar problem to what digg had before the v4 update was put into place.

For those of you not familiar with what was going on then over at digg I'll TL;DR it. Before the V4 update all the submissions on the front page of the website were submitted by called power users. They used the tools built into digg to promote their submissions faster than the ""natural"" progression of upvotes. Some possibly used outside tools as well. This meant that the power users submitted the vast majority of content, and over 90 % of the content that became popular was from power users. Regular users commented often in the popular posts how it was no use to submit anything as they never got any attention. This created a cycle of less and less content from regular users showing up on the front page, and a higher percentage of submitted content being from power users. In the end, right before the digg v4 update it was rare if you saw even one post by a regular user on the front page.

If reddit starts to get just 20 bots or users who submit on average a submission every 2 minutes that would mean 1 submission every 6 seconds is posted by a bot. This would quite effectively flood the /r/all/new/ queue as well as any subreddits that the bots submit to. This could lead to a situation where the bots content ""pushes away"" the content submitted by regular users, putting them off to submitting anything at all since their content would rarely catch the eyes of the knights of new. That would turn the front page of reddit to how diggs front page was; filled with submissions by the few that were consumed by the many.

AMA.",MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE,148,26,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/op60k/i_am_the_author_of_attacked_from_within_a_long/,"Hi Theory of Reddit,

Almost three years ago I wrote ""[Attacked from Within](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2009/3/12/33338/3000)"" a very long essay on the viability of online community.  It was based on my experience with a number of online communities that I've been a part of: Slashdot, Kuro5hin, Digg, 4chan, Hacker News, Reddit, and others.

Because the essay is tl;dr length, here is an extremely brief summary of the points made in the four parts:

1. Eternal September is a problem of scale.  It is very difficult to sustain community in the face of scale.
2. Pseudonymity isn't a solution to the problems of trolling, griefing, crapflooding, and shitposting.  Anonymity isn't either, but it also doesn't feature some of the negatives or false-promise of pseudonymity.  Active moderation either by mods or by the community cannot maintain community culture and standards in the face of scale.
3. Moderation needs to focus on quality contribution not agreement.  Passive/automatic moderation can be an effective first pass.
4. Quality conversation is a better indicator of contribution than voting.  Pairs/dyads of high quality comments should be the key metric, rather than upvotes, for determining sorting of comment threads and front page placement.

Since writing ""Attacked from Within"", I've continued to note articles and trends and discussions relevant to the problem of community on the web.  You can find that [series of posts here](http://www.kuro5hin.org/tag/attacked%20from%20within).

**What harms do meta-subreddit invasions cause?**

There are two main issues here: voting and commenting.

*On voting:*

* A meta-subreddit's users, when voting on a linked thread, may vote in ways opposite from the trend in the linked community.

* Comments may be flipped from positive scores to negative, or vice-versa.

* This makes it appear as though the linked community supports views it doesn't, and that it doesn't support views it does.

* In turn, this makes the subreddit feel hostile to members of its own community.

* Users who have good, positive, well-received-by-the-community things to say may be discouraged from contributing. Users who have bad, negative, poorly-received-by-the-community things to say may be encouraged.

* Users may leave entirely.

* Newcomers and outsiders get the wrong idea, again seeing the subreddit's community appearing to support things it doesn't.

* Users who would have been positive members of the community may be turned away; users who would not may be likelier to stay and participate.

* This leads to an increase in hostilities and tension and drama, which may cause *more* linking from meta-subreddits (e.g. /r/SubredditDrama, /r/ThePopcornStand, /r/RedditDrama, etc. may link because drama; /r/BestOf may link because look at someone putting someone else in their place; /r/WorstOf and /r/ShitRedditSays may link because look at someone saying something terrible (and in the case of SRS, look at ""the community"" upvoting it - although those votes may be from external subreddits)) - causing the cycle to perpetuate itself, and the subreddit to descend into nastiness over time.

* [Here is a very dramatic example of a meta-subreddit reversing the views of the community to which it linked](http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaLog/comments/14vz7u/subredditdrama_ainbow_a_man_makes_a_stark/). You can find more in /r/MetaLog, or in [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/148ksg/ranarchism_bmalee_bans_laurelai_laurelai_tells/c7ax8ue) (which has some overlap with the MetaLog submissions).

These effects are likelier to matter if your community is smaller - particularly if it's smaller than the linking subreddit, obviously, but also small enough to really *have* a community. For example, I don't think anyone takes seriously the idea of an /r/pics community that holds aggregate views; if you're a moderator of a default subreddit, you may not be concerned about the prospect of your community's views being misrepresented by the votes of outsiders. But if you moderate a smaller community, it may be a bigger deal for you. This is especially true if your community surrounds any sort of niche interest, anything that causes aggregate opinions to skew differently from those of reddit as a whole.

*On commenting:*

* Often, users from a linking subreddit will post replies on linked comments threads.

* This frequently derails discussions, particularly if these users receive upvotes from the meta-subreddit they came from.

* Sometimes, this results in confusion - when people show up to try to get participants in the original thread to continue an argument that they had dropped some time prior.

* [Here is a list of users showing up to comment on an at-that-time month-old thread in /r/pics, linked by /r/SubredditDrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaLog/comments/14jjml/subredditdrama_pics_is_the_phrase_op_is_a_faggot/c7gx4rh).

* Meta-subreddit links can also, more importantly, lead to harassment of users.

* [Here's an example from /r/ainbow](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/wv5xh/meta_stop_starting_shit_in_other_subreddits_guys/) ([original thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/wi5q4/trans_rainbowers_does_this_really_offend_you/c5do0bh)) where a bunch of people show up to spout nasty, violent shit at users they don't like, four days later.

* [Here's a really terrible example from /r/AmIUgly](http://www.reddit.com/r/DramaLog/comments/14pku7/jokeaway_metadear_srd_fuck_you/c7f8tum), where a user was told among other awful things to ""take 15 steps back from your computer and fuck yourself in the face you whale bitch"" and to ""kill yourself"". Note that that latter response was left by a user also called out in that /r/ainbow thread I mentioned - 4 months ago. So they've been using /r/SubredditDrama as a way to find people to be assholes to for at least that long.

* The /r/pics example, above, also includes a few pretty nasty harassing comments.

* I won't link this, but we had another user some time back in /r/ainbow who got dogpiled on by SRD users and ended up posting a comment implying heavily that they were going to kill themselves. Days went by, then weeks. We eventually heard from the user and were really glad to know that they were all right, but the harassment they received was honestly very serious, hurtful, and damaging to them.

The derailing-of-comments effect may or may not be something your community cares about. Again, to use /r/pics as an example, this may not really be a big deal there, as discussions tend to be large and meandering to begin with. If your subreddit is at all topical, however, this can definitely impact the quality of discussions for your users.

The harassment issue is something that impacts potentially any subreddit, and in fact I would argue that the larger your subreddit is, the greater the chance that someone will get hurt. This isn't something that's easily resolved by moderation, either, because you need to rely on someone reporting the comments - especially in a big subreddit.

**A solution? Or at least an improvement?**

A couple of months back, /u/KortoloB [hit upon a pretty nice way to address this](http://np.reddit.com/r/NoParticipation/comments/10mqi3/how_to_install_noparticipation/): a short bit of CSS that makes it so that anyone visiting a subreddit where it's installed via a link to http://**np.**reddit.com/r/SubredditName would be prevented from commenting, submitting, or voting. (Click the link and you'll see what it looks like, applied to normal CSS.) This is quick and easy to do, and carries virtually zero costs.

By ""virtually zero costs"", what I mean is this:

* Subscribers to a subreddit using No Participation will never see a difference. NP is set up to show the normal CSS to subscribed users, regardless of whether or not they're visiting via an np.reddit.com link.

* Non-subscribers coming to the subreddit via any other route will also never see a difference. This means that if threads showing up on /r/all and drawing in people from reddit at large is important to your subreddit and a way that you gain new members, for example, NP doesn't affect that. It **only** applies to subreddits linking to np.reddit.com/YourSubredditHere.

* It doesn't affect your CSS in any other way. Visitors coming through np.reddit.com links will see all of your fancy custom CSS, if you have any.

* It's easily reversible, by the simple expedient of removing the CSS if you decide you don't want it after all.

One argument I've seen raised about this is that it doesn't *solve* the problem, because it's easily circumventable in a couple of different ways. This is certainly true. But the perfect doesn't need to be the enemy of the good, and if this *mitigates* the problem, if this makes a community seem *a little bit* less hostile to its own members, if it prevents even just *one* instance of harassment that would have happened impulsively had the opportunity been easily there, then I'm in favor of it. 

And the point has also been raised that this CSS makes it so that invading users have to take an extra action in order to do what they're going to do - an action that forces them to acknowledge directly that they're actively disrespecting the wishes of the community that they're visiting. That, too, might provide a bit of a deterrent effect.

**But this requires that meta-subreddits choose to implement policies that mandate np.reddit.com links!**

It does indeed. One way that that becomes likelier to happen is if more subreddits install NP, and let the meta-subreddits know that they would like them to respect their desire for non-interference. The more people that get on this bandwagon, the more influence it will have.

**As a moderator of a meta-subreddit, why should I require np.reddit.com links?**

* Because you should respect the wishes of other subreddits' communities. Not every subreddit to which you link will install No Participation, and if they don't want to and don't mind your users voting and commenting, that's fine. But if they *do* mind, certainly you should respect that choice.

* Because it will make your subreddit look good. Nobody likes a vote brigade, and implementing an np.reddit.com-links-only policy will show the rest of reddit's users that your subreddit is doing everything in its power to prevent its users from doing that. 

* Because you don't want other subreddits misrepresenting *your* community's views with their votes, and the more meta-subreddits that adopt the policy, the greater the pressure on others to do so as well.

* Because reducing the amount of vote brigading on reddit would have the secondary effect of reducing the petty tribalism that's been infecting the site: the us-vs.-them they're-a-brigade-so-we-have-to-brigade-back mentality.

It would be considered a major feat in AI to have a program pass a Turing test, and there's still a lot of progress to be made (as any Cleverbot conversation makes evident).

On the other hand, if you don't tell anybody the second account is a bot, it might be harder for them to guess. At this point, it's still pretty obvious when a bot can't respond well to questions.

But what if someone made a bot that made comments on popular Reddit posts? And not something that's expressly or obviously a bot (since that's been done before), but a bot whose goal is to emulate the average Redditor. With machine learning, it theoretically shouldn't be difficult -- one would have to record the number of upvotes on a given comment in order to observe which comments are more liked. And the bot wouldn't be too obvious, since nobody expects it and there are hundreds of Redditors on a given thread.

I particularly like the idea of browsing r/all/top or r/askreddit/new with this, and seeing if the bot could become one of the 'celebrity Redditors' known for high-volume and high-karma comments... and yet controlled completely by a script. But even if this isn't possible, it should be possible to emulate Reddit comments in a simple but adequate script that gets some, if not many, upvotes.

And then entertain the possibility that this happened already. There are lots of programmers on Reddit, and surely someone else might have had this idea before, right? If it varied its responses enough, would it even be detectable? People not expecting a bot would give it a lot of leeway.

What do you think about the feasibility? Do you know if this has been done? What interesting consequences would there be if someone created a well-liked account that was later revealed to be a bot?

I wonder how closely a bot could simulate a Redditor. In fact, it might be able to even --

If something gets popular on askreddit or even trueaskreddit it can show up on the self hub.  This way people won't feel the need to only post in the larger sub reddits.

Edit: Okay, from the more I learn about this, it seems that these hubs already exist as networks.

Why does this ""secret club"" mentality persist?",thatfunnyfeeling,167,48,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/nlw5b/the_nsfw_subreddit_with_the_most_subscribers_is/,"I've noticed an increase in the preference of content that has to do with the illusion of a bond between all of us, the ""secret club"" effect if you will.  Amazingly, this idea grows even as the number of people who use this website do.

For example, we've all seen redditors pounce on the typical 16 year old girl or older aunt's Facebook, lamenting the amount of useless content, the vain search for attention, and worst of all, kid photos.  Mention kids on facebook and a torrential downpour of comments about hating kids, the institution of marriage, and on and on.

That's why I was shocked when this hit the front page:

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/nkahk/my_daughter_is_not_a_morning_person/

This is literally Facebook incarnated.  Right down to the first comment: ""I'm never drinking milk again!"".  I could easily imagine one middle aged lady commenting that on her friend's photo of this kid.  It's strange how such hate is turned to joy when the person is a redditor.

What got me though was how popular GoneWild is.  Let's forget a moment about how it's taken over by real professionals posing as nerd girls (side tangent:  Honestly redditor's deserve being taken over by marketing.  They lap it up and deserve it.)

It's still fascinating to me that redditors can have an increased sexual attraction simply due to the girls (ideally) browsing the same website.  This takes the ""secret club"" effect to the extreme.  People are actually getting sexually aroused from the thought of being in this secret club.",,True,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_nlw5b,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/nlw5b/the_nsfw_subreddit_with_the_most_subscribers_is/,

While many of these blogs are not of high quality, there are some very well-regarded journalists who have been banned under these rules.

While I'm not sure if there is a better alternative than the current system, I'm very sure that the spam rules as they're currently enforced have been driving content originators off reddit.

I'm wondering if there are ways to encourage high-quality content originators to post on Reddit, and to keep them here?

This time, instead of just looking at which domains are submitted the most, I've taken the actual scores of the submissions and found the average score across all submissions from that domain. So this list should be a little more accurate for which domains are generally considered high-quality, and not just get submitted a lot.

This list includes only domains that have had at least 1000 submissions, and also includes self-posts, so that it's possible to see which subreddits have the most popular self-posts as well. Again, this is using data as of March 27, 2013 that includes a total of 41,122,525 submissions. I didn't do any of the manual combinations that I had done last time (like youtube.com + youtu.be).

But it's more than that, it seems like a pretty good percentage of the highly upvoted posts you'll see in default subreddits is just talking about how poor the submission is and how everyone who upvoted it is ruining reddit, or how everyone is circlejerking, or how everyone who agrees with the OP is a neckbeard/racist/pussy/etc. 

I've been on a lot of other sites, but I really have never seen anything quite like it. It's not uncommon to have people arguing, people namecalling, etc, elsewhere but I don't think I've ever seen a community where so many people just generally dislike the average user on the site.

1334205830.0,120,self.TheoryOfReddit,s5p1g,Anyone want to try an experiment? (Involving hiding comment scores on comments/posts a user hasn't yet voted on.),,141,21,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/s5p1g/anyone_want_to_try_an_experiment_involving_hiding/,"This is an idea I proposed a while back that got a decent amount of upvotes and a positive response, so I figured it might be worth a shot to try out. In a discussion about getting people to abide by Rediquette, I suggested that comment scores and post scores be hidden until after a user has voted on them, in order to prevent them from being swayed by a comment's current score. It's hard to be sure what kind of effect a comment's score has on users, but it seems like a comment's score has a high propensity to snowball. Obviously, this is largely due to the fact that comments reflecting the tastes of the so-called ""hivemind"" get upvoted while those that are contrary to those tastes get downvoted, at least most of the time, but I suspect that the initial votes do have a sizable influence on a comment's ultimate score.

The best way to test this would clearly be an in-depth study comparing the responses of ""average"" Redditors to the same posts, with one group being able to see the comment's current scores and another not. Since I don't have the resources to do this, I will propose an alternative experiment, instead. I have crafted a set of CSS styles that hide the scores of posts and comments until after the user has voted on them. This could be implemented either by subreddits or by individuals, using a browser extension. I'd be interested to hear about results from both.

This is the code I wrote:

    .score.unvoted { display:none; }
    div#siteTable div.midcol.unvoted div.arrow.down { margin-top: 18px; }
    div#siteTable div.midcol.unvoted div.arrow.login-required.down { margin-top: 18px; }

Any takers?

^Footnote: I'm not exactly a CSS expert, so I can't guarantee the code I've written is completely free of bugs or compatible with other stylesheets. It does, however, work under Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Firefox on OS X, so I'm hoping that means it's fairly compatible.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_s5p1g,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/s5p1g/anyone_want_to_try_an_experiment_involving_hiding/,

[The discussion over in /r/programming/ is also worth a read](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/16p3p8/the_mathematics_of_reddit_rankings_or_how_upvotes/).

As the article points out, the more votes a submission gets and the newer it is the higher it's value and therefore it's ranking.

If it hasn't been conclusively proved before that low effort content rises to the top then this article certainly proves it. I think that we could draw the conclusion that if you don't want fluff to reach the top that content moderation is necessary.

It's a bit sad that the algorithm works like this, as two submissions made at the same time but one being an image and the other an article then the article is inherrently handicapped.

If it takes 10 users .5 seconds to decide to upvote the image and 10 other users 1 minute to decide to upvote the article then the image inherently is ranked above the article even if they are submitted at the same time and if the users opened the links at the same time.

IMO this shows quite conclusively that for a subreddit to have quality content on the front page that content moderation is necessary.

I think reddit as a whole would benefit content-quality wise if a handicap were introduced for images and videos which would decrease the worth of an upvote, to balance it out and give more in-depth content a chance to get to the front page.

1350341547.0,120,self.TheoryOfReddit,11jcok,A structural explanation for the controversies that have erupted on and around Reddit over the last several years.,blackstar9000,146,26,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/11jcok/a_structural_explanation_for_the_controversies/,"One principle that I always try to keep in mind when dealing with online communities is: that changes in the structure or features of a site will tend to have disproportionately large results—and particularly so as you introduce economies of scale.

That's what happened with subreddits. Many of you may not remember that when Reddit started, there were no subs, just a single queue that housed all of the submissions. As the site grew, it became virtually impossible to keep up with the torrent of new submissions flooding through the front page. Giving users the ability to create their own named queues was a way of outsourcing the solution to that problem. Once the mechanism was up and running, the admins could theoretically sit back and watch as the community itself branched off into topical reddits that eased the traffic in each individual sub.

Enter, well, everyone. Traffic on the site has doubled and redoubled itself. In the process, users have created tens of thousands of subs. The vast majority of them are idle, or virtually so. Search for any given term in the subreddit search, and you'll find only a fraction that are really active, a substrate of significantly less trafficked subs, and a base of subs that were created seemingly with no purpose or demand. It's a fair bet that a portion of those dead subs were created on accident (there seems to have been a lot of confusion between submitting a link and creating a sub at some point) or squatters sitting on a name.

That fragmentation makes it virtually impossible to keep up with the entire site. When the admins added subs, they likewise outsourced responsibility for moderating those subs to volunteer users. Anyone who can create an account can create a sub, and anyone can create an account. The effect, as I described it to someone else, is the same as giving a Reddit-branded bullhorn to all-comers, without respect to what message they want to shout through it. They might talk about politics or religion or cats. Or they might yell fire in one of the most crowded theaters on the Web.

There are, of course, rules restricting conduct on Reddit, but the extreme fragmentation of the site often makes it difficult to know when those rules are being broken. A breach in the defaults will generally be found out almost immediately, but there are corners of the site that are infrequently trafficked by anyone who would report infractions to the admins.

When someone *does* find them, though, they will appear under the Reddit brand, and the URL will say ""reddit"" in the domain. For a year or two now, the admins have argued that Reddit is less a single community than it is an engine for community-creation. Part of the implication there is that they're only responsible for the tool itself, and not the content shared by the people using it. That's a premise that would be easier to maintain if we, the users, were setting up instance of Reddit on our own domains, like Wordpress or Drupal. But because Reddit continues to host nearly all of the communities created with its toolset, the rest of the world sees the site as a unity, and likely will continue to see it that way so long as the offending subs appear on the Reddit domain.

In retrospect, the problems there are relatively plain—but mostly in retrospect. While user-created subreddits and user-moderation provided a viable solution to the problem of a hyperactive queue, it made it more difficult for the admins to deal with serious breaches of the rules, and shifted some responsibility for rooting out those infractions on people who had created subs specifically to host those infractions.

That situation goes a long way toward explaining some of the biggest controversies surrounding Reddit. Once the admins had given over the ability to create subs to the users, the creation of highly questionable subs became defensible as a free-speech issue. That's set the stage for the Anderson Cooper piece. Meanwhile, the admins had to moderate those subs by proxy, which led them to rely more and more heavily on mods like Violentacrez to serve as their go-between and keep the site from running afoul of the law.

This may not be the place to discuss solutions, but it seems to me that the situation is untenable. Unless some structural or procedural changes are made, there will almost certainly be a lawsuit, or string of lawsuits, at some point. Whether or not those lawsuits are successful, they will add prohibitively to the cost of the site. The diminishing public reputation of the site may well slacken its growth and scare off advertisers.

There have been several threads lately asking about the sustainability of Reddit. My prediction is that, without change, it will eventually be hamstrung by the problems arising from the subreddit solution to the problem of growth. Once those problems begin to undermine revenue, maintaining the site will grow more difficult, which will, in turn, impact the performance of the site. Diminished performance will result in fewer users, and the more like a ghost town the site appears, the faster the population will drop. Those things may not kill Reddit outright, but they'll certainly add it to the Rust Belt of the internet, alongside social sites like Friendster and Digg.

If anyone can think of a way that moderators or users can address those problems, I'm be interested to read them. Otherwise, I'm posting this strictly for its explanation value, so that we can better understand how the structure of the site has set the stage for the controversies that have recently begun to all but define the public's perception of Reddit and its users.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_11jcok,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/11jcok/a_structural_explanation_for_the_controversies/,

The subreddit is very controversial. Many people believe the subreddit is a ""downvote brigade"", arguing that people whose comments are linked there receive many downvotes after the fact. Others allege that the regular users of SRS derail the threads that are linked there and harass the people who made them. How much of this is true?

I recorded the top twenty threads in [/r/shitredditsays](/r/shitredditsays) and compared the scores of the comments before and after they were submitted to SRS. An analysis of all the comments that received more downvotes than upvotes afterwards appears below this table. Please note that some of the votes in the threads will be different now from when I counted them. There isn't much I can do about that. Generally the scores haven't changed much over the past few hours, though. Be sure to click through to the links if you want to check.

Analysis of the comments and threads that received downvotes. I've also tried to address the claim that SRS users harass other users and derail discussion in the analysis for each item.

* In [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/pqn2q/iran_cuts_oil_exports_to_europe_begins_using_its/c3rg7y4) one, a redditor says, ""may you get nukes soon and stop our Zionist warmonger masters from pushing America into another Middle East war for the benefit of Israel."" If you look at the comments he received, almost everyone in the thread was against him. Even the OP of the thread told him where to go. SRS regular activity is very low.

* In [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ppbqj/my_girlfriend_just_broke_up_with_me_on_valentines/c3r7mk9?context=3) one, a redditor says, ""Good man, bros before crazy selfish hoes"", and then _apologises_ for making the comment in an edit. Troll activity is high, but not from SRS regulars. The comment remains highly upvoted.

* In [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/pp94a/ill_be_the_one_to_say_it/c3r7hgq) one, a redditor eschews feminism for the term ""equalist"". They are shouted down by the regular denizens of TwoXChromosomes. SRS regular activity is non-existent. Someone who has posted to SRS three times also comments and is shouted at by someone who says, ""being an SRS'er, But it doesn't surprise me that you can't tell literal from abstract"". That's about it. The comment remains upvoted.

* In [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/popmt/flying_in_1972/c3r7qed) one, a redditor says, ""You sound fat. And likely unemployable because you took way too many ""Gender studies"" classes."" He is shouted down by regular users of r/pics. SRS regular activity is low. This comment is heavily downvoted.

* In [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/pp53h/learn_the_difference/) one, an image is posted imploring redditors to learn the difference between ""nerd girls"" and ""dumb bitches"". _Almost every single comment_ in the thread is in opposition to this post. SRS activity is very low, and the comments expressed by the SRS users are no different to the ones expressed by regulars of the subreddit the picture was posted to. The submission remains heavily upvoted.

* In [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/pplr1/ding_ding_ding_we_have_a_winner/) one, an image is posted that reads, ""No woman will ever be satisfied because no man will ever have a chocolate penis that ejaculates money"". SRS activity is low. No comment threads appear to be derailed. The thread remains highly upvoted.

* In [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ppk62/4pound_miniyorkie_stomped_to_death_protecting/c3r9ttx) one, a redditor says, ""Yeah, call me racist, but you know niggers did this."" The comment is shouted down by denizens of r/WTF. SRS activity is moderate, but everyone seems to agree that the comment was awful and deserved to be downvoted. The comment is downvoted.

* In [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ppbsj/ai_has_no_money_really_sad/c3ravct) one, a redditor says, ""These people are retarded. I don't mean as in a reddit-insult retarded, they are fucking medically retarded, the bunch of them."" SRS activity is non-existent. The other denizens of that subreddit all disagree with the sentiment of the comment. The comment received four downvotes after being posted to SRS. 

And that's all of them. I don't know about you, but it seems the votes on these comments followed the opinions of people in those threads really rather closely. 

And there is another issue to deal with as well. Does it bother redditors that comments like ""you sound fat"" and ""niggers did this"" and ""dumb bitches"" should receive downvotes?

The only people who would want to click these links are people who don't know how to make a meme and thus have probably never submitted before (at least I hope not).

""Useful sites"" in /r/kpop's sidebar has also been shortened:

/r/kpop only has 15,320 subscribers compared to /r/adviceanimals 2,376,128 subscribers. Also, right now /r/kpop has ~64 users online and /r/adviceanimals has 3,870 and it's the middle of the night for the U.S. Yet, the most clicked link for /r/kpop has 3315 clicks compared to /r/adviceanimals most clicked which is 8795, I was expecting a bigger difference. Koreaboo, EatYourKimchi, Allkpop, and soompi also all pretty popular in the kpop world so it's safe to say that most kpop fans already know about them. Weirdly enough, they got the most clicks.

Click values still aren't very high but in this case they make more sense compared to the size of these subreddits (/r/EarthPorn has about 300 users online per day compared to /r/adviceanimals 10,000). The most clicked for the SFWPorn Network has 12385 clicks compared to /r/adviceanimals 8795 clicks. I'd think this is because the menu has a lot more functionality than the making memes links in /r/adviceanimals do, like I said early, people probably already know about those. The menu in the SFWPorn Network is much more for subreddit discovery than navigation.

----

I've also been using goo.gl links for announcement stickies you might see in the banner or at the top of a subreddit.

In /r/metalcore we had an [AMA on March 25-26th](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/1b04ne/my_name_is_josh_schroeder_i_recordedproduced_know/) and our [uniques for the 25th was 1,262 and for the 26th they peaked at 2,810](http://i.imgur.com/jrqS40z.png). I put a link to the AMA in the banner and it only has [92 clicks](http://goo.gl/#analytics/goo.gl/mfj5g/all_time) ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/gqEVkHJ.png)). 

In /r/EarthPorn we've had /r/SpringPorn stickied to the top since March 23rd and it has been clicked [2090 times](http://goo.gl/#analytics/goo.gl/u1C5U/all_time) ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Rg93u1V.png)).

In /r/kpop we've had our calendar stickied to the banner since December 24th and it has been clicked [1701 times](http://goo.gl/#analytics/goo.gl/8sulH/all_time) ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/03SECGz.png)). 

----

Overall I'm pretty satisfied with the amount of clicks we're seeing so far. /r/adviceanimals gets about 4,000-6,000 subscriptions daily and if we believe the [1% rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28internet_culture%29) then the new users *seem* to be reading the sidebar, unfortunately we can never really know for sure but I think this is our best measure for it so far. 

The number of clicks for the SFWPorn Network also seems to support my previous [idea of subreddit discovery with a menu](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/rc7t8/the_effect_of_inducting_a_subreddit_into_a/).

First, there is a new set of default subreddits, and there are 20 of them. I suspect this is because Reddit wants its new users to understand the subreddit system and find ones they like, and having 20 makes that easier than 10. Interestingly, r/bestof, r/atheism, r/aww, and r/askscience are in these new ones.

The second major announcement is that r/reddit.com has served its intended function and will be closed.

I'm not terribly optimistic about the effects on the new default subreddits, as people who don't know what they're doing will mix with those who do. r/AskScience will have to moderate more in particular. r/AskReddit has also been flooded with spam and other bad posts now that it has become the default subreddit to submit things to.

As a comment there points out, there seems to be a tendency of people to downvote, almost mindlessly, if a comment is already in the negatives, and likewise for upvotes. This seems to aggravate the already annoying ""hivemind"" effect. 

So, **would there be any negative effects to hiding comment karma for a while**, until it's gotten a decent amount of eyes to judge it on its own merit, not on popularity (perhaps an option for moderators to toggle on and off, or even set a specific amount of time for the numbers to appear)?

That's still true. I don't like what I'm doing here today. Unfortunately, changing circumstances have made it necessary.

What changing circumstances? For one thing, whyicry is gone. I've checked with an admin and it looks like whyicry deleted his own account. Beyond that, I don't know any more about it than you do. So that's placed a hitch in the plan I outlined last time.

And while I could just play musical chairs with a new diplomat, a number of mod mail messages and other low-level drama from the past week have convinced me that we'd be better off with a different strategy. So please be advised of the following changes:

1. **There's a new rule in the sidebar.** It reads: ""Submissions that would be appropriate for /r/SubredditDrama will be removed from TheoryOfReddit by the moderators."" That rule is taking the place of the SRS rule. Here's fair warning: I intend to take a rather broad interpretation of that rule. No more singling out mods for bad behavior. No more speculation about who's responsible for the decline of this or that reddit, or Reddit in general. There's a place for that sort of stuff, and starting now it ain't here.

2. **Once a guideline, now a rule.** See the box in the sidebar that says, ""Submissions should focus on issues, solutions, or strategies that could be reasonably addressed or implemented by users and moderators""? When I introduced it, I meant for it to be a guideline. From now on, I intend to enforce it as a rule. If your submission is a suggestion that only the admins could implement, it will be removed from ToR. As with the new rule, there's a place for stuff like that, and it happens to be elsewhere.

3. **Links are back.** At least, on a trial basis. I know that a few people weren't happy about them ever going away. To be honest, I wasn't totally happy about it either, but it seemed like the best solution at the time. As it happens, I think the two changes I've spelled out above will resolve a lot of the problems that going text-only previously fixed, so we're going to see how reintroducing them helps. Bear in mind that all of the rules that apply in the case of text-posts also apply in the case of link-posts.

4. **New mods.** They're coming. Don't call me, I'll call you.

I call it the ""Vote Fader."" Just a little idea I've been kicking around for the last couple of days, so I decided to implement a prototype. I'll be introducing them to several of the reddits I moderate.

First of all
---

Is it displaying properly for everyone? It should more or less [like this](http://i.imgur.com/mElaT.png). It's built in CSS to make it easier to implement in different reddits \([for example](/r/worldevents)\), so a little bit of variation is to be expected, but please let me know if there are differences that make it difficult to read or even uglier than it is in that screen cap.

So what's it for?
---

Well, actually, I'm hoping that will be fairly intuitive. But in case it isn't, here's the thought process behind it.

Reddit has a general [etiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette), but that generality makes it less than perfectly applicable to reddits that don't have totally straightforward subject matters, as well as reddits who have found that their submissions tend to skew in inappropriate ways despite a clear subject matter. There have been a lot of strategies for encouraging subscribers to correct those tendencies by voting, but not all subscribers vote with the same criteria in mind. When exhortation fails, the mods sometimes have to resort to more intensive moderation just to keep the forum pointed in the right direction.

The Vote Fader is an attempt to implement a clear, visual set of guidelines encouraging users to vote in line with the goals of a reddit. The idea was to present a hierarchical gradient of content types, from those that users are most encouraged to up vote, to those that users are most encouraged to down vote, with some middle ground for more ambiguous posts. Or, from another point of view, content types listed at the top are those that are ""most wanted or appropriate"", and they ""fade"" down from there to content types that are totally inappropriate and unwanted.

The point is to give users a relatively simple and easy to understand graphic so that they'll be better informed about the purposes of the reddit, and so that they'll have something to point to in helping to acclimate new subscribers to the goals of the place. And hopefully, they'll actually notice it, intuit its meaning, and incorporate those guidelines into their voting habits for the reddit where it's displayed.

Cool. So how do I put one on my reddit?
---

Maybe you shouldn't. Many reddits probably don't need a vote fader. If your subscribers seem to be voting along with the intent of the reddit, you may as well hold off until there's actually a problem. If there's a simple relationship between your subject matter and the sort of content you want, you might not need one at all. I tend to create reddits with slightly more tricky goals, so having something like this is helpful for that, but it might not fit every reddit out there.

Besides, if *every* reddit were to adopt a vote fader, it might decrease the effectiveness of the whole concept. People tend to notice sidebars only when they offer something noticeably different from the rest, so let's not make this a totally standard feature just yet, okay?

Pfft. Whatever. Just show me how it works.
---

Okay, okay. Geez. It's pretty simple CSS with a cheap little image as the background. There are really only three steps to implementing it.

First, download [this image](http://i.imgur.com/BAE3Q.png) and upload it on your stylesheet page as ""fader."" If you already have a lot of custom CSS, you might want to work up your own fader to match, but the basic idea is to have a color gradient representing up vote to down vote.

Next, plug in the following definitions into your CSS:

    .side a[href^=""//#fader""] {
    height: 150px;   
    width: 250px;   
    padding-left: 50px;   
    background-image: url(%%fader%%);   
    color: black;   
    display: inline-block;   
    background-repeat: no-repeat;   
    cursor: default;   
    line-height: 1.4;   
    text-align: center   
    }

Finally, plug the code into your sidebar and adjust the text to say whatever you want it to say:

    Voting guidelines:
    ---

    [Most appropriate content  
    Moderately appropriate content  
    Marginally appropriate content  
    Neutral content  
    Marginally inappropriate content  
    Moderately inappropriate content  
    Most inappropriate content](//#fader)

(*edit:* [Idonthack](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/my0qo/the_vote_fader/c34vorz) reminded me that you can put white space in code when using markdown.) With its current settings, the fader can accommodate up to nine lines of the default font and text size without stretching its boundaries too badly. Watch out for line length, though. If you have fewer than 10, you can stretch them to fit the fader by tweaking the *line-height* attribute of the CSS. It's currently set to 1.4; increasing that number puts more space between each line so that adhere closer to the color coded space in the background.

Isn't that a terribly inefficient way to achieve that effect?

When blackstar9000 stepped down as moderator here and handed the subreddit over to me, it honestly came as a huge surprise. I've been a long-time contributor here, and have used many of the theories presented in this subreddit over the last year to create dozens of successful subreddits. Two years ago, I wasn't a moderator of anything. Now I moderate [more than 70 subreddits](http://redditdirectory.com/6301/syncretic), and I've been involved with dozens more in the past that I've since stepped down from due to my commitments elsewhere. Reddit is in dire need of good moderators, and I honestly believe that this subreddit is helping immensely in that regard.

I strongly believe in active moderation. Due to the ""assembly line"" nature of reddit, and the fact that most redditors vote from the front page instead of the subreddit itself, active moderation is needed to ensure the subreddit stays true to its original goals. I also strongly believe in transparent moderation. Keeping secrets about the way you moderate your subreddit helps no one and breeds distrust. Moderators need to actively interact with the users of their subreddits, and if the users are submitting content that is off-topic for the subreddit, instead of just silently removing the submission (essentially sweeping it under the rug), moderators should let the submitter know exactly why their post was not appropriate, and if possible suggest an alternative subreddit where the submission would be welcomed.

I also believe in having a large, diverse team of moderators, which is why you may have noticed the mod list here has grown considerably. I've tried to choose active members of this community who have experience moderating a wide variety of subreddits.

In a unanimous decision by the moderation team, and in no small part because of the [community response to such a change](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/rys16/how_would_the_theory_of_reddit_community_feel/), this subreddit is now strictly self-posts only again. The moderators believe this is in the best interests of the subreddit, and the community agrees. As a result, we have removed rule 4 (the rule banning image submissions), as it is no longer possible to submit those. We have also combined rules 2 and 3 into a single rule, which leaves us with three simple, easy to understand rules governing this subreddit.

I want to thank you all for bearing with us through this brief time of dramatic change. In the last month this subreddit has gone from one with unenforced guidelines that was largely moderated by the community (through the use of upvotes and downvotes), to one that now has strictly enforced rules and is moderated by a dedicated team of individuals.

That's a big change, and I understand some of you don't agree with the new rules here, which is why I would like to announce a new subreddit, /r/CasualTheoryOfReddit. Casual TOR, much like /r/CasualIAmA, will be completely moderated by the users. Only obvious spam will be removed. I've added /u/AutoModerator with instructions to approve absolutely every submission or comment in that subreddit.

&gt;The front page of r/atheism is universally known to be crap. This subreddit is populated by a bot and filters what it copies so that no dumb images, facebook posts, etc are shown.

&gt;How does it work?

&gt;Every story here is a copy of something submitted to r/atheism by a single user which is controlled by a python script. Just click the ""show text"" square for each submission on the page, you can then view the link or self post text, along with information about the author and a link back to the original submission's comments. Don't forget to vote here as well though so that the front page is filtered even more! Also, please keep in mind that if you comment here, the original author in r/atheism will NOT see the comment!

Is this a worthy effort to spruce up a massive (and out of control?) subreddit plagued by noise and memes, but still has its moments of intelligence?  Could other massive subreddits benefit from this type of service?

Or, is this too little, too late and it's time to continue abandoning ship and head over to other more quality focused subreddits like [/r/RepublicofAtheism](/r/RepublicofAtheism)?

I'm hoping this comes off as helpful to the discussion here rather than just looking like shameless self promotion (which there's a lot of in academia but is truly not my goal here).

Summary: We study crowd-curation mechanisms that rank articles according to a score which is a function of user- feedback. We precisely quantify the dynamics of which articles become popular in these systems. While crowd-curation can be relatively effective for cardinal objectives like discovering and promoting content of high quality, they do not perform well for ordinal objectives such as finding the best articles. Our analysis suggests that user preferences and behavior are a far greater determinant of curation quality than the actual details of the curation mechanism. Finally, we show that certain shifts in user voting behavior can have positive impacts on these systems, suggesting that active moderation of user behavior is important for high quality curation in crowd-sourced systems.

A quick note about this work: The goal of this work (and a lot of work in theoretical fields) is not to write a model that completely captures reality but one that is realistic enough that it allows us to highlight the salient features of the system that we deal with. So when reading it, many of you might have objections and say ""hey thats not the way things work/I vote/etc"" and you would be correct. But to an approximation, we're confident that it captures the fundamental features of reddit (and similar sites pretty well).

These moderators can answer any questions that users may have relating to moderation or even reddit in general. We will also encourage moderator AMAs where mods can discuss their own unique moderating experience and answer questions about their specific subreddits. Hopefully we can provide some level of conflict mediation as well, a place where users can air their grievances about moderators without the thread turning into a hate-filled witch hunt because of sensationalized or biased titles.

Reddit is growing larger, and yet the available pool of moderators is struggling to keep up. Most new subscribers don't even know what a subreddit is, let alone what a moderator does on a daily basis. To a lot of them, mods are simply shadowy authority figures that ban people and make new rules. Some of them even get mods confused with admins (as many of us know, the two roles are vastly different).

The moderation team of /r/bestof made a dramatic change recently when they [banned links from default subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/y3ufx/rbestof_results_of_the_no_defaults_experiment/). Combined with the [Subreddit Discovery search function that chromakode recently unveiled](http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/yjz0u/reddit_change_subreddit_discovery_search_by/), this means that thousands of redditors are discovering smaller, niche subreddits on a daily basis, redditors that wouldn't have done so in the past. The population of reddit is slowly spreading out, moving away from the defaults. New users are still flooding in at unprecedented rates, and the rest of reddit is struggling to keep up. This is a step in the right direction.

This post is basically just an update to those, including expanding the range down to subreddits with 500 subscribers or more, and the addition of a few new tables.

Notes about the statistics before I start spitting out tables:

* **""Human mods""** means moderators that are not bots or ""puppet"" accounts (shared accounts used for anonymous communication and such). Any account with less than 25 comments/submissions ever *and* less than 100 combined karma is considered to be a bot/puppet, as well as about 20 other ones I manually set as bots (AutoModerator, various flair bots, etc.)
* **""Active""** is shorthand for ""probably active"". Because I have no access to moderation logs, this is based on the user's public activity (comments and submissions). Any account with at least 25 comments/submissions in the last two weeks is considered ""probably active"". This is not completely accurate because some users actively moderate without commenting/submitting much, but it seems to have a fairly strong correlation, so makes a good approximation.
* The three ""official"" subreddits (/r/blog, /r/announcements, and /r/reddit.com) are excluded.
* Deleted/banned moderators are excluded from all statistics.
* All statistics only consider subreddits with 500 or more subscribers.
* These statistics were gathered over the last few days and will be slightly out of date.

**General statistics**

*""Unique"" only counts each individual user once, so it is a count of number of different users that moderate above that subscriber threshold.*

This isn't a post outlining how that post is awful, it really isn't that bad. This is a post wondering how a post that has zero relevance to AskReddit made it so far into the front page before a mod finally had to step in and snipe it. 

The post in question should have set off all sorts of alarm bells for anyone reading it. It is requesting that reddit, ""Please give my son youtube viewers/subscribers/comments"". There's nothing special about that guy's son that would make him appeal to reddit, he's not disabled and doesn't have cancer (not that it should matter!), he just likes making youtube videos.

I spent about 4-5 hours on the site, only upvoting hivemind links and things that were going to go big, I hit up every single one of my subreddits (50-ish) and voted on at least 3 things from each (sometimes the new section didn't have any recent posts). I even went to subreddits I don't subscribe to like /r/adviceanimals and /r/demotivational to try and game some more points.

In the end, I didn't end up tallying which posts hit the front page and which posts didn't, although I'm certian that posts I downvoted went nowhere. I checked back later in the day and many of my posts that I had upvoted were on the front page of their respective subreddits, the grandma taking a picture of her cat with a cellphone I caught with 30 votes, it then went on to get 62,000 votes here http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/yrhvx/getting_my_grandma_a_camera_phone_was_the_best/

The donald trump story, multiple /r/food posts, the apple post from /r/technology, many niche subreddit posts etc.

However, I did not end up getting the Bellwether trophy.

After all that work, it ended up going to /user/tehoreoz that day.

I went through probably over 200 links, upvoting or downvoting accordingly, of which about 85-90% hit the front page of their respective subreddits and that still wasn't enough.


After I finished I realized how bad a trophy this really is though,  

Phinaeus 106 points 2 days ago*

*Wtf? Doesn't this just encourage those who indulge in meme posting and circlejerking?*

Yes, yes it does. I found myself seriously considering upvoting reposts because that's what was going to be big that day, and that also means that image macros and easily consumed content is more prevalent than worthy self posts and discussion topics.

Thankfully that was my one shot and I blew it so it's back to being the silent knight of new, downvoting reposts and hivemind circlejerks before they blow up and hit the frontpage.

I think they do need to re-do the Bellwether Trophy though, maybe weigh self posts that hit their front page more heavily than image posts, maybe get rid of it all together, becaue right now it only encourages bad behavior.

Like youtube, when comments are disabled it completely removes anyone's ability to talk about it. You can't just start another thread like in a forum setting.

This post is not about any of the drama or events. I must also let people know up front that I did not approve of anything those accounts were doing and had even questioned why they were allowed in posts here before. 

The recent use private information to scare off undesirable accounts is in theory a great move. It cleans up the site and removes a great deal of controversy. But it has also said that you can punish those you disagree with by threatening to put their personal information online or by actually publishing their information. In a nutshell it promotes vigilantes go out and create the justice the desire rather than the justice they get. 

This form of retribution was now has a sort of legitimacy to it. The problem occurs when it is not used against vile and reprehensible people and instead gets used on those you just don't agree with. What now stops a person seeking to get rid of a high karma account with many low investment posts to simply begin doxxing those accounts or at least legitimately threatening to dox until they delete their account?

Seems like that is not a problem. If you're not doing anything wrong, then you have nothing to worry about. In the real world that works out well most of the time, but online those taking/seeing your private information still get to retain their own privacy and sometimes those people are unsavory or at least misguided. It's like somebody taking your wallet and hotel room key and leaving it on the strip in Las Vagas. Most people will walk past, but you worry about the ones that don't. 

With the gawker article on Violentacrez his home address was posted in the comment within hours. That's the sort of precedent I want no part of.  Shouldn't reddit be a place where things get dealt with by admins and proper channels rather than vigilantes?  Has Reddit moved into a era of fear and retribution? Has the culture changed on the site so much that doxxing is considered okay?

I know these are long-time redditors we're talking about here who (hopefully) truly do care about reddit, but allowing a few people to moderate so many large communities creates two problems in my eyes:

1. Mods find themselves stretched too thinly and may not be able to devote as much attention to a particular subreddit as they probably should, and

2. Separation of powers. Look, I highly doubt that there's a cabal of ""power users"" attempting to carefully guide (and censor) dissent and/or other ""unsavory"" submissions. But it just seems to run counter to reddit's egalitarian spirit to have someone moderating more than one large subreddit at a time (and I'd consider ""large"" in this case to be at least ~10K subscribers, but obviously that's a subjective determination). And I'm not sure how comfortable I am with this monopolization of mod duties--or even the fact that such monopolization is possible *at all*. 

Is it that nobody else wants to do ""the dirty work"" for huge subreddits that probably get tons of spam and/or trolls each day? Is it that only a few long-time redditors are competent enough to moderate such communities? 

Letting different users moderate each large sub would allow for a diversification of interests in the ""upper echelons"" of reddit--and, for whatever it may (or may not) be worth, go a long way towards dispelling some people's ""power users"" concerns. 

So is this just a terrible (or at least terribly naive) idea? I'm honestly not trying to ""stir shit up"" or imply that certain people are bad at performing their duties. I am implying that it seems oddly unfair to let a few users hold so many keys to the many doors in this castle we call reddit. Time and again, I've seen moderators both publicly and privately insist that they're ""just like every other redditor."" I don't want to disbelieve that, but it seems a bit disingenuous to say when you're a mod at like half the default subreddits.",,False,,t5_2rtff,True,,,True,t3_pymjm,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/pymjm/you_shouldnt_be_able_to_moderate_more_than_one/,

They are the [strawman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawman) and [motive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_motive) fallacies respectively, but because they're a kind of humor device they escape analysis far too often.

I'd like to discuss them with you, because I think they're discourse cancer; if you mapped the downfall of a forum relative to how frequently these two devices appear you could probably get a pretty strong correlation going.

---

The Sarcastic Caps Strawman is when you present a loud mockery of an opponent's position sarcastically. This should be easy to visualize, but as an example:

&gt; **Megan:** I don't think we can sustain social security into the 21st century.

&gt; **Christina:** HHAAHAHA BECAUSE LETTING POOR PEOPLE STARVE IS SO PROGRESSIVE AND FORWARD-THINKING. 

Christina's response takes ""we can't sustain social security into the 21st century"" and misrepresents it as ""removing social security is forward-thinking and progressive"", then uses an obnoxious tone to suggest that Megan thinks she is progressive and forward-thinking. For all we know, Megan could be absolutely right; social security could be unsustainable into the 21st century. Or she could be absolutely wrong, and the finances could add up in favor of social security. At the moment, Christina's response attacks neither -- it just makes a claim to how Megan sees her views.

If your audience is intelligent, the Sarcastic Caps Strawman will be downvoted immediately. When it's accepted, though, people like Megan have several concerns if they want to convince an audience that they're right:

- Megan sees through the layer of sarcasm and notices that the argument is a strawman, in which case she responds directly. However, she runs the risk of ""taking Christina too seriously"", a rebuttal that unfortunately is acceptable when your audience is not mature and accepts responses like the Sarcastic Caps Strawman as sufficient.

- Megan responds with equally loud sarcasm attacking Megan's strawman, technique of argument, or both. Depending on how one-sided her audience is, this could work. However, if she has two-sides to juggle -- people who are above this sort of technique and people who aren't -- she may alienate the side of her audience that would be persuaded by a more formal, direct argument.

Christina, on the other hand, has an advantage: if she is responded to directly, she can just say someone else doesn't get her joke or that she's being taken too seriously. If she is responded to with similar levels of sarcasm, the people who originally took Megan seriously stop taking her seriously.

In other words, *even though Christina is wrong and has actually made a fallacy*, once you accept that the sarcastic caps strawman is an acceptable form of argumentation, it's advantageous to do it because you have more ways of escaping criticism. It's a form of [hedging.](http://tinyurl.com/hedgingwikipedia)

On the other hand, if you know that sarcastic paraphrasing of another's argument is an unacceptable form of argumentation, arguments can proceed with relative ease and the intellectual quality of your community will probably remain fairly constant for some time.

---

The second technique, ""translated"", is similar to the sarcastic caps strawman except it attempts to make a mockery of the opponent's *intent*. This is the motive fallacy -- instead of addressing what the opponent is arguing, you address the *reasons they could be making the argument*.  The official term for this is [""ad hominem circumstantial""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem#Circumstantial) because it asserts that someone's circumstances in which they are making an argument affect the truth of that argument.

The most common version of ""translation"" redditors have experienced goes like this:

&gt; **Megan:** Taxing Americans in the 250-500k range would probably just tax cognitively demanding professions like engineers; you should tax people in the 500k+ range, because most of those jobs are in finance.

&gt; **Christina:** Translation: ""Don't take away money from *my* family, take it from those guys one step above me! We're good people, honest!""

Here, Christina doesn't even claim Megan's argument is true or false one way or the other; she sidesteps it entirely to attack Megan's intention.

This technique's history of usage on reddit goes as far back as the novelty account [Translated](http://www.reddit.com/user/Translated) in 2007.

---

It's worth noting that this type of critique isn't always fallacious. Many people take on a pretension when arguing for or against some thing. These techniques, if properly applied, serve as a valid critique of pretentiousness on the part of a particular group's attitudes. /r/circlejerk is a good example of using these techniques to critique pretentious attitudes without actually using them as a means of argumentation. *As* a means of argumentation though they are improperly applied almost all the time and become fallacies with equal frequency.

I hope in making this post I have at least shown adequately how these techniques work and the toxic effect they can often have in argumentation; ideally, after understanding their mechanics, any fallacies employed sarcastically will be better understood.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_nrtds,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/nrtds/the_sarcastic_caps_strawman_and_translated/,

And other musings on design.,thebbking,150,45,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1artyl/why_has_the_design_of_reddit_not_evolved_and/,"[I _did_ read the sidebar, and I thought this was the correct place for this post. If not, please let me know]

As an active Reddit user - crazy active, it consumes me - I've slowly transitioned to all but ignoring browser based Redditing. I have Reddit News on my Nexus 7 and I use that instead, nearly 100% of the time. I began to wonder why this was, when I couldn't think of any other website with an application alternative that I preferred.

Maybe it's blaspheme, with the near culture surrounding the somewhat iconic design of Reddit, but I realized that it's a poorly designed website. To newcomers, it is confusing. I have friends that aren't users simply because the first few visits result in confusion. It took me time and a lot of convincing to finally give the site a chance for the same reason. The colors are meek and sometimes they clash distractedly, the layout is kind of messy and definitely confusing if you aren't familiar with it, and the default CSS is an absolute mess. It's a design that scares people away, and if it wasn't for my discovery of a few beautifully designed apps, and RES' night mode, I probably would have turned away from Reddit.

Which raises an interesting question: Why is RES expected to innovate rather than the site itself? I've noticed that when features are mentioned, users are generally directed to RES, because it either already has that feature or it will be easier to see it implemented by asking it's developers. But perhaps that is a separate discussion.

Additionally, since I began using Reddit about a year ago, there has been no tangible design change that I can recognize, and this is surprising when you consider the ridiculous popularity of the site, the obvious downsides to the current design, and the rapidity of web technologies and standards growth and evolution.

Effectively, I would suggest a redesign of the site. It pains me to make this comparison, but while Digg is far inferior to Reddit in terms of technology, community and quality, they certainly nailed design much better than Reddit did. I don't like making a suggestion that would create even more desire for me to abandon my work, but it's certainly the largest issue I have with Reddit.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_1artyl,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1artyl/why_has_the_design_of_reddit_not_evolved_and/,

Thanks (and I *do* mean thanks) to a shout out from [subtextual](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/i486a/so_im_unsubscribing_from_all_the_major_subs_what/c20s9cx) yesterday, we've seen our biggest influx of new subscribers ever. How big? Try 500 new subscribers. About 10 times as many as we got during the last big immigration. Almost exactly as many as joined up over the span of the preceding 4 weeks. Or, put another way, the population of /r/ToR has increased by about 25% in a single day.

Which would be, in and of itself, a Big Thing, but as davidreiss666 just pointed out to me, we've also caught the eye of reddit co-founder kn0thing, who just [tweeted about us](http://twitter.com/#!/kn0thing/status/83169655027539968). Thanks to him, as well. Uniques for the day are already up to more than half what they were yesterday, which is to say, about three times what they are on any normal day. I won't be able to see new subscriptions until tomorrow, but I'm expecting more big gains.

So first, of all, let me say, in bold letters so it doesn't get lost **welcome to Theory of Reddit!** Thanks for stopping by, and thanks to those of you who've subscribed. If you'd like a little background, here's [my first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/cbjrn/a_little_bit_of_background_as_to_why_i_created/) explaining what led me to create this reddit. If you have any questions as to how people are expected to conduct themselves here, the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) is as good a starting place as any.

All of this comes at a rather auspicious time, since (judging by the fact that only the first three posts have been archived by reddit's automated system) Theory of Reddit turned one year old this week. So, happy anniversary to us. And thanks to everyone who has contributed to this reddit over the past year. I honestly didn't know if anything would come of this little experiment, and that it's turned into a thriving community of like-minded people is due mostly to those of you who stuck it out over the last 12 months.

We talk a lot in /r/ToR about the impact that large crowds have on reddits, so there's a natural fear that such a big influx of new subscribers and submitters could spell the end of the things we appreciate about this sub. My hope is that you'll treat these changes as a kind of experiment. We're not likely to hit quintuple digits any time in the next week, but a big bump like this usually ends up being a kind of tipping point. It means, among other things, that we'll likely get more per day subscriptions than before. But faster growth won't necessarily mean the sort of decline in quality that we've lamented in other, huger reddits. This is a chance to watch growth up close, and to talk about what it takes for a reddit to accommodate that growth without losing its soul. Hopefully, what we learn from this can be used to create stronger communities throughout reddit.

1366391824.0,98,self.TheoryOfReddit,1coowx,/r/findbostonbombers is a perfect illustration of systematic error - or how the crowd can fail,AsABlackMan,149,51,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1coowx/rfindbostonbombers_is_a_perfect_illustration_of/,"The answer is really simple too - [systematic error](http://www.physics.umd.edu/courses/Phys276/Hill/Information/Notes/ErrorAnalysis.html).

Typically large groups of people make the ""right"" decision. When you have a whole lot of people guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar, the median guess will be pretty close (if not spot on). That's because in this instance the errors are *random* - the bad guesses are ameliorated by the good ones. 

But when our biases affect what kind of errors we make. They become systematic errors. When we have biases about how the world works, it tends to impact how we interpret what we see. Our errors are no longer random, so the wisdom of the crowd/miracle of aggregation no longer applies.

Typically we don't have strong biases about jellybeans and jars, so our errors are usually random. But when it comes to things like crime, terrorism, and nationalism we're prey to a whole lot of biases that affect how we see and interpret data.

The fact that reddit focused on a [brown-skinned guy](http://i.imgur.com/3Bh7rkc.gif) with an Indian name as the prime suspect is probably the most telling thing. It might imply that there's a definite bias on who redditors expected to be capable of perpetrating this crime. Either that, or there just wasn't enough data or analytical ability to make a solid determination. Note the awful quality of the .gif for example.

No online community can be immune from systematic error because we're all subject to biases that we're not even aware of. This is especially true when it comes to important issues like what happened in Boston.

What users and moderators can do is fact-check. Confirmation bias is a subtle beast and it's a tough thing to beat. In fact I'm willing to bet that some of you will look at [this gif](http://i.imgur.com/3Bh7rkc.gif) and still conclude the innocent guy and the suspect look alike while completely ignoring how terrible the data (the source pictures) are.

But the best thing to do is to discourage this sort of crowdsourced investigation for deeply emotional issues. Biases rise to the surface and that makes a reddit ~~witch hunt~~ investigation problematic at best, and [dangerous at worst](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/18/how-the-internet-accused-a-high-school-student-of-terrorism.html). 

**TLDR**: We all have deeply ingrained biases that surface when something deeply emotional happens. These biases affect how we interpret the world and can lead us to the wrong conclusions.

Anyway, as an internship project I made the free spellingchecker fowlt.net. I thought it would be a fun idea to promote it a little by making a Reddit bot which looks for things that often go wrong (the words 'you're', 'then', etc.), gives them to fowlt, and posts a reply when fowlt thinks the comment contains an error. I also did my best to make sure the bot is as nice as possible. It uses this account, see [the user page](http://www.reddit.com/u/fowlt) if you're interested.

What I expected were a few grumpy replies, but mostly lots of upvotes and happy people, because these things people often complain about are now pointed out automatically. Unfortunately, I got mostly downvotes and super-unfriendly replies. I've turned it off for now - my goal isn't at all to annoy people.

My questions to you now are:

* What could I do to improve it?",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_1bi2gf,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1bi2gf/why_doesnt_reddit_like_my_bot/,

FWIW, I think the healthiest subreddit could be /r/gonewild. Despite covering a subject with millions of subsections and related topics, /r/gonewild has found a way to deliver targeted content to its subscribers in a drama-free way. The use of [m]/[f] tags in posts has driven a lot of the drama out of the site, and users know instinctively to follow those rules when posting. What do you think the strongest subreddit could be?

We will let all posts through, be them images, self posts or videos. They can have absolutely any content, apart from advertisements (spam) or personal info - these will still be removed asap.

We will let the community decide what gets (and stays) on the front page.

If the quality of the subreddit increases/stays the same, we will adopt this new lax moderation style indefinitely, however, if at the end of the experiment, the subreddit has deviated substantially from what its purpose is for, we will re-implement our old rules and moderation style.

**rules which were voted in by the community in the first place!*

---

Personally, I think this will be a welcome, fascinating study to see how a  large, popular subreddit can/cannot self-regulate, and how much of an impact moderators have on subreddits. 

Hopefully, it will open the eyes of the masses to show them what work we do ""behind the scenes,"" however, it may also provide excellent insight to moderators, showing exactly what the community want.

What do you think will result from such an experiment? Do you feel vastly different results would occur in other major subreddits, if similar experiments wee to be implemented?

BMeckel in /r/depthhub recently posted this mod announcement:

&gt;I wanted to talk to you guys and girls about the direction this subreddit has been heading over the past couple months, and what we as moderators can do to guide it going forward. We've gotten A LOT of complaints that certain posts aren't ""depthhub worthy"" or just don't seem right for the subreddit, and usually the mod team is in agreement about those things. The problem is, 9 times out of 10 they're not breaking any rules, so we just let them stay there. What we need is a good set of rules to help us determine what is ""worthy"" of depthhub, while at the same time not just making up those rules by ourselves. The issue is that what one mod may consider ""unworthy,"" another mod, or even a huge part of our userbase may disagree, and we'd really like to avoid that. 

&gt;So, what I'm here to ask you guys for are suggestions on what we can do to stem depthhub from just becoming bestof2. Each time I've brought things up, we really haven't been able to get a good read from the whole community, which is why I'm making this self post.

&gt;Some suggestions that never really got decided on were:

&gt;* Remove posts that had a comment requesting the submission be removed, if that comment had over x number of upvotes.

&gt;* Exclude default reddits.

&gt;* Allow the moderators to use their discretion as to what is appropriate for the subreddit.

&gt;Now those are just a couple, we really want to hear more, or if you like one of those let us know. We'd like to improve the quality of DepthHub to what it was at the beginning, and we just want to make sure we do that in a way that a large number of you support.

&gt;Also, because this will invariably come up. We don't really consider ""but people are voting on things, that means they like them"" to be a valid argument anymore. People are extremly liberal with their upvotes, but much more reserved with downvotes. On top of that, to get to the front page of this subreddit, you need less than .1%, which is obviously not a good indicator of what people really want.

&gt;Anyway, PLEASE weigh in with what you think could help.

The author cites several examples of how marketing and easy access to alcohol make it easy for people to get drinks, with serious costs to society. While David Nutt doesn't argue for prohibition of alcohol, he does make it clear that a greater form or regulation is necessary

However the top comments completely ignore this and instead focus on how all drugs should be legalized simply because alcohol is. 

&gt;[""[It is] Totally ridiculous and hypocritical to prohibit any drugs on health reason you going to legalize the biggest killer [alcohol].""](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/zjwqt/david_nutt_if_alcohol_were_discovered_today_would/c658f4m)

Another user compares the current ban on other drugs (such as marijuana) to prohibition in the 1900's, arguing that currently-illegal drugs should be allowed. 

&gt;[I'm not sure how long it will take to reach the same conclusion about other drugs, but prohibition isn't really a solution.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/zjwqt/david_nutt_if_alcohol_were_discovered_today_would/c6594av) 


There are countless more examples of pro-drug rhetoric in the comments. Most of them point to alcohol and use it as an example of why other drugs are less dangerous and therefore should be legalized for recreational use. Make note that David Nutt makes little mention of other drugs or their downsides. In fact, the only reference is in the first paragraph, where Nutt claims that ""we have to see alcohol in the same context as other drugs, not separately"". Nutt makes no mention of illegal drugs, nor does he point to legalizing other drugs as a solution to alcohol abuse. The only talk about this is in the comments section of Reddit.

So, my question is: Is the Reddit hivemind overly pro-drug? Or is this just a fringe case? If Reddit is pro-drug (as I suspect it is), what about the site causes this to be true?

________________________________

EDIT: I wanted to point out some more examples of the hivemind at work. A commenter makes the claim that

&gt;[Neither Heroin nor Meth are especially dangerous. Alcohol is far more damaging and much more capable of causing a fatal overdose](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/zjwqt/david_nutt_if_alcohol_were_discovered_today_would/c6597ny?context=4)

Obviously, this is false. In fact, a study done by the Canadian Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) [cites that meth users have the highest death rate out of all drug users.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871612000786).

Each week, an individual /r/TheoryOfReddit moderator will host a discussion about a theoretical changes to reddit's code, infrastructure or official policy that would not be possible for users and moderators to accomplish alone; it would require admin intervention.

Here is this week's topic:

##What are the possible ramifications of further integrating social media into reddit?

**Prelude**

Many websites have buttons to share articles and videos on reddit, along with facebook, stumbleupon, twitter, etc. However, I have never used one of these buttons and I presume very few people use these buttons on a regular basis. At present, this is the biggest link between reddit and other social media sites.

____________

**Discussion**

Oftentimes, when the topic of reddit's ""death"" is mentioned, the general consensus is that linking reddit and social media would bring about the downfall of this website. Linking reddit and social media could be achieved in a multitude of ways:

* Forcing reddit accounts to be linked to a facebook profile (extreme)
* Allowing users the option to link social media sites to reddit
* Allowing/forcing reddit users to list information in their profile page*

What are the pros and cons of each of the above options? How would voluntary vs. involuntary social media integration matter?

Recently, the comment boards on ESPN.com transitioned from anonymous usernames to FaceBook profiles. The level of discourse increased tremendously, and racist/homophobic comments are rarer than ever. Would a similar set up for reddit have *any* benefits at all or would it inevitably destroy the website? Other points to consider:

* Reddit as a business would make tremendous profit if it was linked with Facebook, it is common knowledge reddit has a had a difficult time turning profits in the past
* Trolling and hateful comments would likely subside
* It would be easier to identify users engaged in self-promotion (blogspam, etc)

Thoughts?

*Some possible information on profile pages:

* Name, gender, location
* Interests
* Subreddits subscribed to
* Friends

It's beautiful in its simplicity, and at the same time it seems to exemplify the worst possible outcome of the image reposts that have been taking over reddit. Where does one draw the line, though? If you're going to allow reposted external content, why not allow reposts of the best comments on it? After all, the top no-no on [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) is:

&gt; Please don't:

&gt; Complain about reposts. Just because you have seen it before doesn't mean everyone has. Votes indicate the popularity of a post, so just vote. Keep in mind that linking to previous posts is not automatically a complaint; it is information. Votes indicate how the community values information, so just vote.

Is there some meaningful standard by which reposted links are okay but reposted comments are not? Or do we have to allow all forms of duplication if we want to avoid making rules that aren't consistent? Or do we have to prohibit all forms of duplication?

[werrrrrd](http://www.reddit.com/user/werrrrrd) correctly pointed out a similarity between this behavior and the concept of [Keynesian beauty contest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest).

Simply, the Keynesian beauty contest is a contest where participants have to choose one woman among eight, and they will ""win"" the contest if they have chosen the one that the majority has selected.

A naive player (a newbie redditor?) would simply pick the one they feel is the most beautiful. But 2nd degree players will instead try and pick the one they think *everyone else* will think is the most beautiful. And so on at higher orders until what is called a [Nash equilibrium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_Equilibrium).

I propose that memes are the Nash equilibrium of reddit. They represent the winning strategy for redditors who want to vote in the way that others will vote (i.e. to gain karma or simply to be validated in voting in the same direction as others.)

To put it more simply, **memes are what redditors assume the majority of other redditors will find funny.** They do *not* represent something people find funny for themselves.

**They need not, in fact, be funny for anyone.** But they appear funny to *others* when you consider them for voting.

These emotions are what I see as easily manipulating people. So help me out and see if I've missed anything.

1. Outrage. This is most obvious in r/politics and similar subreddits, where people dogpile the high horse and wallow in their supposed moral superiority to whomever the perceived villain is. Popular targets are the American government, police, conservatives, and corporations. I also think that the ubiquitous existence of &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; is another bit of evidence for the prevalence of outrage as common currency.

2. Nostalgia. I notice this mostly talking about video games as well as movies/TV. It's an easy tactic to call up the positive emotions associated with childhood and to exploit it. Yes, Pokemon was awesome, give it a rest.

3. Onions. A good sob story will receive lots of attention. This can often be related to outrage, if the victim is especially relatable. I'd argue that that the line between outrage and onions is how easily the average Redditor can identify with the victim.

4. Forever Alone. This is related to onions, but it's a usually a little more lighthearted. It's basically a pity party and everyone's invited. I find it actually kind of interesting, as most of the others emotions translate easily into real life circle-jerkery, but crying about Forever Alone-ness is considered emo and less acceptable IRL.

Besides just listing the easily exploited emotions, I wanted to point out that the popularity of these Reddit emotional hacks is because there's a desire for people to share in a communal emotion. Outrage works by presenting a clear in-group superiority that people can participate in, although maybe that's not obvious to its participants busy bashing the villain. Nostalgia operates by tapping into happy childhood memories. Both of these remind me an old folks' home.

Personally, it's irritating to see these emotions hijack any discussion, hindering people's ability to consider any naysayers. The problem is that nobody likes their feelings to be invalidated, so whenever they get sucked into the intensity of a circlejerk emotion, every dissenting comment is interpreted as an attack on the indvidual's right to the feeling he's experiencing. Additionally, because the circlejerk is providing the sense of group solidarity, it will get many of its participants to focus excessive hostility to the perceived threat to its existence.

As far as advice animals and image macros go, I was subscribed to r/adviceanimals from pretty much the start of the subreddit. I unsubcribed just a few weeks ago because more and more I thought the subreddit was going in a direction that I didn't like.  
At first, the subreddit seemed to be about pointing out our flaws and poking fun at those. Think things along the lines of courage wolf or foul bachelor frog. While, of course, not really representative of everyone who would read r/adviceanimals, they were more introspective image macros, and the OP presumably agreed with the sentiment echoed within.  
Now though, and for the last few months, it seems that image macros have gone from making fun of ourselves to making fun of others, in varying degrees of cruelty. Scumbag steve, I think, was the first macro to start this trend (and the incredible overuse of the scumbag meme really annoys me, but that is a seperate issue). Then it branched out into other memes, including College Freshman, Scumbag girlfriend, and a lot of other newish memes.

Just a thought experiment that I'm curious to get some input on)

For those of you not familiar with robot9000, please refer to [this](http://blog.xkcd.com/2008/01/14/robot9000-and-xkcd-signal-attacking-noise-in-chat/) xkcd blog post.

The simple concept is this: in order to decrease the incidence of one-word responses and common memes, there is a bot which tracks every comment that has been made, and removes any repeat comments. Of course it isn't perfect, but it is seen by some to be a decent technical method of killing the lowest-effort comments such as ""lol"", ""first"", etc.

What might happen if a subreddit was to enable such a system? How do you think it would affect discussion in big, medium, and small subreddits? What positive and negative behaviours might it incite?

Also, if you feel robot9000 in unsuitable for reddit, could it be modified in some way to make it more suitable?

1357153853.0,94,self.TheoryOfReddit,15u8ek,TheoryOfReddit's new years resolution: Fill the wiki with quality content!,creesch,127,33,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/15u8ek/theoryofreddits_new_years_resolution_fill_the/,"2012 has been a good year where we did see a lot of quality [navel-gazing](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/15nobc/best_of_theoryofreddit_2012_winners_and_some/ ""Best of TheoryOfReddit 2012""). 
But due to the nature of reddit a lot of the knowledge gained is easily lost if we are not careful, this results in a lot of ""reinventing the wheel"" which is something nobody desires. So our goal for 2013 is to preserve old knowledge and make sure that new knowledge does not fade away in obscurity. 

In order to achieve this we are going to employ a new shiny tool that the admins recently released; the new wiki system.
Since we want this to be a community effort of those most involved we made the wiki editable by any user that has a account older than 90 days and who has accumulated at least 50 subreddit karma. 

So feel free to browse around and if you feel like contributing, please do so! A good place to get started is the [index page](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/index) of the wiki, some important pages are listed there. 
One note for people that want to contribute, to keep things organized we wrote the [wiki editing protocol](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/wiki_protocol), please take the time to read it. 
If you feel like contributing but don't know where to start; the [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/faq) is basically a big list of content waiting to be incorporated into the wiki. 

Some examples of information already in the wiki:
 
* [The reddit glossary](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/glossary)    
* [The BIG list of meta reddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/meta_subreddits) 
* [The BIG list of meta websites](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/meta_websites) - Example of a page that needs expanding, descriptions are needed. 
* [library/What I've Learned from Hacker News](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/library/learned_from_hacker_news)
* [Reddit formatting](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/formating)

Another example what we think requires the collaboration of community is the [subreddit map](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/subreddit_map) page inspired by a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/15o22t/what_is_the_best_map_for_subreddits/) a few days ago.

With the introduction of the wiki we also added a new subreddit to the TheoryOfReddit family: /r/theoryofwiki the only submissions allowed in here are direct links to wiki pages. We have created this subreddit in order to be able to discuss wiki pages in a organized way. People that can not edit wiki pages yet can still comment here, so if you feel like something is missing from a wiki page you can always leave a comment in the relevant /r/theoryofwiki post. 

**Future plans** 

Future plans for the wiki include some external tools that make use of reddit's api. The tags we require under every page are a example of planning ahead, they will make it possible and easier to make a wiki search tool so information can be found with ease. 
The subreddit map page is something we plan to use as well to create a visual representation of the information on that page.

From my American perspective the threads I'll see when I first get to Reddit were most likely dominated by those of a timezone further to the East.

&gt; Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

---

&gt; Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something, and do so carefully and tactfully.

---

&gt; **Please Don't.** Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

---

&gt; **Please Don't.** Mass downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.

---

&gt; **Please Don't.** Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it. Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.

I know it's not anything new, but I feel it's something that's growing; redditors are caring less, and less about reddiquette, and it affects the comments, and content that the majority of redditors are exposed to. Instead of fostering an environment where knowledge, and understanding are valued I'm seeing a place where unpopular, or misunderstood opinions are hidden away so that people don't have to think about them. 

I haven't seen this issue discussed anywhere, and I want to start bringing more attention to it, because I feel a lot of redditors just haven't thought about what kind of environment they're propagating by downvoting minority opinions. 

So far the only solution I'm aware of is to stick to smaller subreddits, but it only serves to cut down on the amount of content you're exposed to, and it really doesn't fix the original problem that continues to fester.

I think it could show really well what the most active areas of reddit are and how the different subreddits fall into 'cliques' (you could link the subreddits my the number of common members and/or the number of x-posts between them).

Whilst I suspect such a diagram will mostly confirm what we already know, you can sometimes find some surprising links and conclusions that none of us suspected to find from such analysis.

If this hasn't already been done, I reckon I could cobble something together to produce such a graph, but I don't know where to get hold of the data to do this. I reckon for starters, you'd just need two tables: one with one reddit user per row, and each subreddit they subscribe to in the columns (no usernames or other personal data would be required), and one table listing x-posts - no detail would be needed other than the subreddit the x-post is on, and the subreddit it links to.

I appreciate this might be a lot of data - if there's too much maybe it can be split amongst other redditors and we can each perform analysis on a smaller segment of the data, and then combine all the summaries.

Update: So after some great discussion I'm going to focus on defining links between subs by looking at the domains in link posts. See the discussions below for an explanation of why the common subscribers approach is unworkable. /u/deimorz has kindly offered to provide me with some of the [stats he's been collecting](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/zcd40/im_in_the_process_of_scraping_every_submission/). From this I should be able to do some analysis based on posts to subs that link to other subs (so x-posts would just be a subset of this). Some of the other data fields he's collected could provide some interesting enrichment for the graph too.

It might take me a little while to get around to finishing this, so I'll provide an update once I've done it. If you have any other suggestions for other interesting things that could be added, just let me know :)

Another is how /r/pics has the 4 million subscribers statistics in their header image. 

I'm curious why these numbers are so celebrated. From my understanding of the code, and from speaking with reddit developers about it, these numbers have nothing to do with how many people are subscribed to these subreddits. Let me give an example:


1. I sign up to reddit today, and the subscriber count for /r/ELI5 is 500,000.

2. I am not subscriber 500,001, because reddit's source code ""lazy subscribes"". That means that since I have not changed my subreddits, reddit is not actively saving which reddit's I'm subscribed to, it just shows me defaults.

3. Now say I add /r/MorbidReality to my subs list. I am now subscriber #500,001 on /r/ELI5 because reddit now tracks where I'm subscribed to.


This number is NOT the number of subscribers, but rather a number of people who have changed their default subreddits after signing up. Which seems like a meaningless statistic to celebrate. If that number steadily goes down, that is useful to know that people are actively unsubscribing, but an increasing statistic means nothing for that particular subreddit. Weird eh.

I personally feel that this is only the beginning of a very turbulent era for reddit. We are reaching a tipping point. Reddit is becoming large enough that it's starting to [make national news](/r/RedditInTheNews). We are growing at an alarming rate, and we have been doing so for as long as I can remember. The media is starting to take notice more and more often, and more often than not, when they do take notice they paint the entire community with the same brush.

Let me tell you something: *It's not a good brush.*

The admins have made it clear that reddit is centered around [free speech](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19975375). Except... when that speech is considered spam... or when it involves personal information... or when it involves the sexualization of minors... OK, so the admins have implemented [specific rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) that supersede free speech for the greater good of the community. That much I understand. Why, then, do they allow blatant trolls to operate unimpeded in their own subreddits? Subreddits that will continue to attract media attention until one of them is banned for ""threatening the structural integrity of reddit"" and the media is satiated for another six months until the cycle repeats itself again.

I'm not an admin, so I can't answer that question. Hopefully one of them *will* address that point soon, and not with some back room memo to the mod elite. Hopefully they will tackle this important issue on the front page, and let their userbase know exactly how they feel about outside communities attacking our moderators. Hopefully they will explain why they continue to allow vile shock and gore, incest, &amp; rape to thrive unchecked on our website, essentially as troll bait, waiting for the media to stumble upon it.

I'm not an admin... but I am a moderator. I'm involved with [dozens of successful subreddits](http://stattit.com/user/syncretic/), some of which I created myself (/r/EarthPorn, /r/reactiongifs), others I rescued and revived via /r/redditrequest (/r/facepalm, /r/Demotivational). Back when I first created the SFWPorn Network, I was told several times by several different people that I was trying to use reddit in a way it was never intended. That I could achieve better results with another service. I'm used to breaking through preconceptions about how reddit works or how it's *supposed* to work. In fact, I [try to do so whenever possible](/r/TheoryOfModeration).

No one can deny that moderation is a highly debated subject here on reddit. More specifically, how moderators choose to moderate their subreddits is a hot topic. There are generally [two mainstream schools of moderation](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/mj0ln/active_moderation_vs_the_laissezfaire_approach_or/) (laissez-faire vs. active), and as a general rule, most redditors will heatedly advocate for one over the other when the subject is broached. We can argue about whether subreddits such as /r/WorldPolitics and /r/TrueReddit are working as intended or not (that would be enough material for an entirely different post), but personally I don't subscribe to laissez-faire moderation. I just don't think it works in my subreddits. I practice active moderation in every subreddit I moderate, this one is no exception. I want to talk about taking active moderation a step further... what I like to call distributed moderation.

Distributed moderation is a school of moderation wherein the number of moderators in a given subreddit is directly tied to the number of subscribers in that subreddit. In /r/TheoryOfReddit, for example, we try to keep the mod:user ratio as close to 1:1,000 as possible. This is usually done in order to keep the moderation duties relatively light per individual mod. In times of high activity (for instance when /r/SubredditDrama or /r/bestof links to the subreddit), there will be an adequate number of moderators online to keep the expected level of moderation constant and unwavering. It also ensures that a large number of active members of the community can have a direct say in matters of subreddit policy, and distributes the power so it doesn't stay in the hands of a select few individuals.

Members of the community need to have more input into how this website is operated. I'm not talking about upvotes and downvotes. Active moderation works because there are rules, and there are moderators to enforce those rules. Most default subreddits now employ active moderation to some degree, with the exception of /r/Gaming and /r/Atheism. Moderators approve or remove thousands of submissions every day in the default subreddits... but hardly any of them ever touch the comments section. The only (ex) default subreddit to take the plunge into moderating comments is /r/AskScience... arguably one of the best-moderated subreddits around.

Reddit is either top-down, or it's run by the community. You can't have it both ways. At no point have I seen the admins state that reddit is run ""by an elite cabal of power-moderators""... but that's essentially the truth. The default subreddits aren't going to change unless the moderators in power want change and take steps to enact that change. The admins do pretty much whatever they want to do, with no apparent rhyme or reason, and the mods are left guessing their intentions.

If reddit truly is run by the community, we need to have more community members involved in the system.

Why? Well, usually (at least for redditors that people remember, like /u/violentacrez or /u/JewBoySandler) once you've been around long enough, people tend to remember you for one thing and one thing only. When /u/violentacrez was around, could he have made a thoughtful post or comment in /r/science, for example? I don't think anyone would take him seriously. Then there are users that completely derail any thread they enter because of what they're remembered for--/u/JewBoySandler commenting *anywhere* will draw lots of people screaming ""Married yet? ;-)"", and the thread where that started was only two months ago. Similarly, there are some people who are just hated on by almost everyone, like /u/karmanaut --although the hate has died down recently, for a while his comments would be in the negatives no matter what he said.

So, while an account with a lot of attention and/or karma allows the user to have a lot of influence, I think sometimes they'd want to escape the stereotypes/reputations they've built up for themselves, which is why I suspect that a lot of high-karma redditors have alt accounts--they can't erase what they've done, so they just ""start over"" in a sense. It's like /u/moot said in his AMA--as 4chan has grown more popular, he's had to comment as an anon more and more, because his mere presence will immediately derail a thread.

of course i wasn't welcome.  i didn't get banned, but i may as well have been.  because it's not the general idea of politics being discussed, it's US only.  and though i may have theories i want to share about how politics works and how social media is transforming it, /r/Politics isn't that place because it's only a conversation about what is going on in US politics.

and here is the domain problem.  the word ""politics"" has been hijacked by a niche who don't have a perfect claim to the word.  it's a powerful word, and it means the same thing to Canadians and Britons and Australians etc.  i'm aware that the demographic of Redditors skews American, but that ends up a tyranny of the masses in that the core concept of what politics means as a word has been taken exclusively from other people who use the word.

the current fight in /r/Canada reflects some of these self-same questions.  how is that the one most central subreddit in Canada can be run without any accountability to its membership?  is there a word more central to Canada to build an alternate reddit with?  is there a place where you would be more likely to find Canadians talking?  does the critical mass of readership, and the centrality of the word somehow oblige it to be more open in its operation?

Here it is: http://alecrn.xen.prgmr.com/suggest/suggest.php

This is just a prototype to experiment with some ideas I had regarding upvotes/downvotes and how well you can infer whether someone will like something by comparing them to other users' voting patterns.

My current method is to basically look at the conditional probability of liking one post, given that the user likes another post.  For instance, if you upvote A, then we can infer the score of post B by examining the cases where other users upvoted A and then voted on B.  There is a little more to it than that, which I'll gladly explain to anyone who asks.

I plan on making the data public soon, so anyone can look at it and perform their own analyses.

If you'd like to contribute, making an account takes a couple seconds (you just need to pick a username and password and away you go).

Be really really picky.  Click ""MORE"" when you want to see more things similar to that post.  Click ""LESS"" when you want to see less things similar to it.  Also, rather than ignoring a post you're not interested in, click ""LESS.""  Vote on everything.  (""MORE"" and ""LESS"" are basically upvotes and downvotes, but somewhat nuanced)

Also, please note the wizard.  When you log in you should see a blue box that advertises the wizard, which will ask you about some movies, shows, songs, etc.  This will quickly provide information for recommending more things to you.

You'll notice a lot of the posts are sourced from reddit; this is just to provide a nice sample of content for you to vote on.  Also, the posts are organized into categories (sorta like subreddits).

For instance, after you complete the wizard, go to the [movies category](http://alecrn.xen.prgmr.com/suggest/suggest.php?category=movies) and see if there are movies recommended for you based on the movies you previously liked!

I'm hoping a fair number of people will use it so it provides useful information to its users.  However, the ranking algorithm is somewhat computationally intensive, so hopefully it will scale well with the number of users and posts.

Does there really need to be a sub for everything? Larger subs break down from having too much LCD content, and the smaller subs end up sunken because there aren't enough subscribers.

This also most likely leads to the ""circlejerk"" tendencies of subreddits, where we find all the like minded people we can and set specific rules to only have content everyone agrees on.

1335814339.0,92,self.TheoryOfReddit,t07i7,The effect of banning images on a trending subreddit,Skuld,105,13,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/t07i7/the_effect_of_banning_images_on_a_trending/,"/r/Guildwars2 went through massive growth this weekend, as the first public beta testing weekend for the game took place, and a well-placed plug on [/r/gaming](/r/gaming) brought in a wave of new folk.

The /u/AutoModerator bot has been running for 5 weeks now with some significant moderation conditions - it removes all direct link submissions to imgur.com, or *.jpg, quickmeme.com etc.

The bot removes the post, and leaves a comment like so: http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/syk26/playing_some_guild_wars_2_when_i_have_a_sudden/c4i1ooj

Images take only a second to view and upvote, whereas a few paragraphs of self text, a YouTube video, or an article take 5 or more. This means subreddits of this type tend to be drowned out by images.


The bot removed 246 posts under these conditions over the beta weekend, yet only 5 of those resulted in moderator messages, asking to be un-spammed. Does this mean people don't go back to check the comments of their post?

The intention was to make a fair change with the aim of guiding the subreddit along a different path than gaming brethren such as [/r/gaming](/r/gaming), [/r/Minecraft](/r/Minecraft) or [/r/starcraft](/r/starcraft) (an image board). No human moderator subjectivity, and the bot is perfect for that.

Citing the things you say is very much required when making a controversial or unknown claim. Redditors know this, and they ask for sources from the person making that claim. However, nobody reads these sources. Instead, they just make sure that the little blue link(s) is present. They may click the source to read the first line and check if the website is remotely legitimate, but they very seldom read the text being posted. This isn't entirely the readers fault. The proper way to cite something is to also list some kind direction in which you will find the relevant material in the source. That never happens though. Instead, the writer just throws some links at the bottom and feels the job is complete. So, I think we should encourage commentors to properly cite their sources, rather than just provide some blue text.

1329410379.0,86,self.TheoryOfReddit,psgsw,"Trolls; when to ban them, when to ignore them, and why.",,131,45,290,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/psgsw/trolls_when_to_ban_them_when_to_ignore_them_and/,"I just finished reading blackstar9000's post ""[Assigning blame](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/pqsie/assigning_blame/),"" and I felt compelled to speak on this matter. There is a certain mindset in some communities that banning trolls is useless; they will simply come back with another account the next day. While that is certainly true in some instances, I think the vast majority of users who we consider to be 'trolls' do not consider themselves to be trolls at all. They simply consider themselves to be users with unpopular opinions, and they pride themselves on voicing those opinions, even when they are accused of trolling and downvoted.

At a certain point, however, these users become a problem. At a certain point, they are no longer simply bringing unpopular opinions to the table, they are antagonizing the subreddit, and can fairly be labeled a troll, even if they don't appreciate that label themselves. I think a few things need to be taken into consideration by a moderator when deciding who is a troll and who is not, and if banning those users will improve the discourse and overall health of the subreddit.

Are they civil, or do they respond with sarcasm when their ideas are challenged, or do they engage in rational debate? The first sign of a troll is the use of sarcasm and ad hominem attacks to deflect criticism. Such tactics only serve to derail the conversation and should not be welcome.

Take a look at their comment history. How do they behave in other subreddits? Do you see a pattern of behavior? Do they make a habit of pushing other users' buttons? Do they consistently get downvoted from subreddit to subreddit? What subreddits do they normally frequent? Do they have a 'reputation' of trolling elsewhere? In my opinion it is very easy to spot a troll vs. a regular user who is simply spouting an opinion that most people don't want to hear.

Once you have identified a troll, you need to make a decision on whether to ban them or not. As I said earlier, many people hold the opinion that banning trolls is useless; they will just come back with another username and resume right where they left off. While that may be true in some instances, I disagree with the sentiment overall.

As I said, most trolls do not consider themselves to be trolls at all. When banned, they will become upset, possibly curse at you in mod mail or try to start a witchhunt elsewhere. They may indeed come back with a throwaway account to show you that your ban is seemingly meaningless. However, at this point, if you simply ignore the throwaway account, nine times out of ten, they will abandon it and return to their original account. They take pride in their accounts the same as we do, and most of them will simply focus their attention elsewhere. Reddit is a big place, and if they get banned from a single subreddit, well, there are 10,000 other subreddits to pick from.

Personally I have taken a zero tolerance policy on trolling in all of my subreddits, and it has worked very well for me. Even the ""professional trolls"" as I like to call them, the ones like ickis_the_killer, who at last count had created over 100 accounts, will eventually get bored if you ban every one of their accounts the second they step foot in your subreddit with a throwaway for the purpose of circumventing a ban.

It is my personal opinion that banning trolls takes very little effort from the moderation team, yet has an enormous benefit to the subreddit. Trolls derail conversation, cause drama, and otherwise create mayhem. It takes a minute or two to create a new account; it takes five seconds to open the ban list and add another name to the list. Isn't that much better, in the long run, than allowing these users to troll your subreddit on a daily basis, sometimes for months at a time?

Some extrapolation on a rare bit of data.,blackstar9000,98,12,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/klzpz/has_voting_kept_pace_with_the_growth_of_reddit/,"A tangent in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/kkviz/are_we_responsible_for_a_reddit_urban_legend/) got me to thinking about the value of [a comment made by jedberg](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/eaqnf/pardon_me_but_5000_downvotes_wtf_is_worldnews_for/c16omup) more than 10 months ago. The comment was made in response to a post that complained about a [worldnews submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/eadmg/north_korea_has_fired_several_artillery_shells/) receiving 5,000 down votes. Jedberg's response was:

&gt; As of this moment, that story has the following actual totals:

&gt; &gt; 2666 up 140 down

&gt; The numbers you see are fuzzed for anti-spam reasons. The more active a post is, the more out of whack that fuzzing becomes.

As far as I know, that's the last set of unfuzzed numbers publicly available to redditors. It's an artifact, more reliable as evidence than a lot of the data that's been marshaled in theories about Reddit. (Incidentally, if anyone knows of any other recent sets of unfuzzed numbers, it would be useful to collect them here.)

What's their value? Well, for one thing, they're an indication of how much voting has changed on Reddit over time. That story hit the front page with a 95% approval rating. After *14 hours*, it had a total of 2,806 *actual* votes. This was, remember, less than a year ago, well after the Great Digg Migration. In another couple of months, the admins would report that the site had crossed the [billion monthly pageviews](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/fdyyf/reddit_billions_served/) mark.

It's possible that I'm looking at this wrong, so correct me if I've missed something, but it seems to me that the conclusion pointed to when you correlate these facts is that the popularity of a link that was likely seen by millions of people over a span of half a day, was determined by less than 3,000 votes.

That's for starters. Let's compare that link (which, remember, had a 95% actual approval rating 14 hours in) to some earlier submissions. [This](http://web.archive.org/web/20100908091110/http://www.reddit.com/r/all/top?t=week) is the earliest Wayback Machine entry I can find for /r/top/all. The top post there has a score of 3603. In other words, the *total* score (up minus down) for that post is higher than the total number of votes (up plus down) for the last submission we have reliable, unfuzzed numbers on. The difference in their submission time, by the way, is about 4 months.

As luck would have it, [that post](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/d8d1f/dear_entire_mainstream_media_please_stop/) just happens to be about Reddit's traffic stats vs. Digg's stats for July of 2010, and reports that the site was cresting 300 million monthly page view at the time. And if you look at the all time top scoring submissions [right now](http://www.reddit.com/r/all/top), you'll see a few from the last 6 months or so mixed in with the top 50, but far more are from 1 or 2 years ago. There's even a [three year old submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/70b2f/is_there_anyone_else_out_there_that_wants_to_see/) with more than twice as many total points as total votes in our most recent unfuzzed stats (and not quite twice as many total points as that example's [final total score](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/eadmg/north_korea_has_fired_several_artillery_shells/)\).

There are, of course, too few data points, and too much ambiguity about those data points to be sure, but these broad points seem to me to suggest that voting practices have *not* kept pace with the large increase in the number of page views Reddit has seen over the past 2 years. Or, put another way, more than three times as many people are visiting the site now as at this time last year, but there doesn't seem to be a comparable increase in the number of votes.

1364353658.0,89,self.TheoryOfReddit,1b36vs,Reddit functions via the same fundamental principals as a human brain ,revilo366,137,48,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1b36vs/reddit_functions_via_the_same_fundamental/,"I majored in neuroscience in college, and it is fun to explain things in terms of fundamental biological principals. Reddit is a good analogy for the human brain and here's a couple reasons why...

The sensory input of reddit is the redditors who generate content or attach the various content they've received from the internet world (videos, gifs, pics, songs, and text). Reddit simply acts as a categorizer and temporary storage unit for this data. Redditors can therefore be likened to individual nerve cells (i.e. of the retina, or within the cochlea) who only somewhat selectively bring data to the appropriate association cortices (subreddits) of the brain. Eventually the reddit hivemind might be upgraded to be able accept other types of input (i.e. tactile), but only if it is adaptive. 

Smaller subreddits are [infrequently] indexed by the larger ones, in much the same way that the cortex is a representation of all the data indexed by the more powerful memory associations via the hippocampus.


The cells of the frontal lobe can be represented by the individual lurkers of reddit. These people choose what random posts are to fall into what computational cognitive neuroscientists call the ""attractor basin"" of consious (and unconscious) thought. These ideas are prioritized on a minute to minute basis to exemplify the short term memory component of the hivemind. The deep stimulation comes through the pursuit of more in-depth aspects of reddit (i.e. subreddits and comments), while the strictly sensory input nature of the front page can be likened to the pure sensory experience of everyday life while living in the moment.

There are other similarities, and reddit can again be used to represent the even larger hive mind of the internet in general and how it utilizes the google and youtube indices in the same way an individual human brain utilizes a hippocampus to index memories and pictures in our minds. Now we simply have to decide if we want to surround ourselves with 4chan-like influences or Reddit like instances, or simply be lost in the greater hive mind of the internet alone. Like the first cells when they made the crucial decision to come together to form a greater organism, we must also come together like we have in the past but now more fundamentally - with the same efficiency and immediate communication as our bodies allow their individual cells/orqans.

Now we have a few questions to ask ourselves; do we want to be a generators or a lurkers? Do we want our brain to be fraught with about 10% NSFW pics or do we want to exist in a mind where it's closer to 50%? Do we want our brain to be mostly pictures or mostly text files? Do we want more pictures of animals or less? 

I know what I think we ought to do but i also know my natural inclinations. All this means is we should be careful with our upvotes and downvotes, making each one a conscious decision to consider our unconscious. If this site is to represent my brain, I want it to be a good one.

It seems unlikely to me that any default mods would want to take the risk. I make the suggestion only because I think that *is* a solid idea and would likely improve things both for users and mods.\*

The suggestion to ""break it down"" comes as a follow up to [this discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/vjemc/three_related_recommendations_for_better/c55jnuc?context=1). There, I said that hyperactivity in a sub leads to a range of problems:

&gt; Once a sub reaches a certain level of activity, it becomes difficult to moderate, yes, but it also becomes difficult to manage in a number of ways. For a reader, it becomes difficult to keep up. The conveyor belt problem intensifies, driving quality down. And despite all of the problems that arise because of its hyperactivity, people hang onto it, if for no other reason than that a superactive subreddit is the biggest soapbox around. Your chances of getting on the front page plummet, but if you luck up and wind up there, your audience numbers in the millions.

So once a sub you mod becomes hyperactive, how do you counteract those negatives. You break it down.

1. Figure out a rational division of the subjects covered in your sub;

2. Splinter off additional subs according to those divisions;

3. Set up a bot that collates and cross-posts the best scoring submissions from those subs;

4. Set the hyperactive sub to allowed submissions only from approved submitters, and make the bot the only approved submitter;

5. Update the sidebar with an explanation and links to the splinter subs.

The result is that the hyperactive sub is now a hub for a network of subs. It serves both as a network-specific bestof, and as a launching point for those splinter subs. And because normal users can no longer submit to the original sub, those who want to submit are forced into the splinters, while those who just want to read and comment can concentrate on the hub.

This strategy does, of course, require more mods – or, at least, a broader distribution of mods. If /r/AskScience were to break off into multiple splinters (say, AskBiology, AskChemistry, AskGeology, and AskPhysics) the network as a whole would likely need more mods than AskScience alone, but no particular splinter would need as many mods as AskScience has now. And as I pointed out in my last post, fewer mods make for more effective decision-making.

Content in the hub (i.e. the original, hyperactive sub) would also improve, since posts would have to go through the topic-specific filter of the splinter subs before they showed up in the hub. Those posts would also benefit from having been exposed to the more specific crowd first. Consider that in terms of the AskScience example. One of the major problems the AskScience mods have worked hard to address is that of questions getting derailed or answered incorrectly early on. Now imagine AskScience as a hub. Someone posts a thread to AskBiology; the users with a specific interest in biology take a crack at the question first; by the time it gets cross-posted to AskScience, it already has a professional-grade discussion going.

---

 \* Which raises the question: If I were the top mod of a default sub, would I put this plan into action? Hell yeah. But then, I like taking chances on big ideas.

* Warning and then possibly banning serial reposters of content that has been on the front page of /r/pics in the last three months (with &gt;300 karma).
* No rehosting of webcomics. The original authors deserve the credit, traffic and ad revenue.

Moderators have a right to dictate what is or is not allowed in their subreddits. It's at the very core of how subreddits were originally designed and how they still currently function today. Reddit is a free market. If anyone disagrees with the way a subreddit is currently being moderated, they are free to create their own subreddits and use their own personal style of moderation. [/r/trees](/r/trees) and [/r/gamernews](/r/gamernews) are shining examples of how this system works. It's not easy to create new subreddits, but it can be done, and as the population of reddit continues to grow exponentially, it becomes easier and easier to create [new subreddits](/r/newreddits) every day.

I want to make something clear. We are not trying to turn back the clock to some mythical time in the past when everything was perfect and there were no bad submissions. That time has never existed. There have always been memes, bandwagon submissions and other noise that have slips through the cracks and threatens to drown out the signal. It's inevitable in a subreddit approaching one million users that not everyone will read, follow or even care about the rules. I personally have removed submissions from the front page for blatant rule violations every single day since I have been added to help enforce them.

The most important thing you can do if you are interested in helping out is browse the front page of /r/pics and use the report feature, or even message the moderators to draw our immediate attention to blatant rule violations. It does not matter if a submission has 5 upvotes or 5,000, if it breaks a rule it *will* be removed. BEP has been spearheading this effort and he is doing a wonderful job of recruiting new moderators to help that are passionate about this issue.

It’s a network of subreddits to promote discussion, share articles, news, and other links on reddit, but without the other distractions. There is a collection bin for egos conveniently placed near the door.

In the Republic of Reddit every participant is responsible for the quality of the network; they also follow the [republiquette](http://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicOfReddit/comments/kp1qo/republiquette_v3/), which our own modified version of the reddiquette. Participants vote to elect mods, remove mods, and make changes to republiquette when necessary. All discussions are held in public and the person who makes any modifications will publish the reason for the change. The Republic of Reddit is designed to provide as much transparency, honesty, and accountability as possible. 

Reposts, memes, and drama are expected to be left behind. What will remain is a fairly moderated, cohesive network of subreddits; a network that attempts to emphasize the quality of reddit and minimize off-topic submissions and irrelevant conversation.

The Republic Network is a restricted series of subreddits, this means that all subreddits in the network are publicly available for viewing and commenting, but submissions can only be made by users who have been given approved submitter status. To be added as an approved submitter, an account only needs to be at least three months old, with a moderate level of activity (at least 100 link karma, or at least 30 comments with positive karma made in the subreddit within the last 90 days). *That’s all it takes.*

The Republic of Reddit, like most things, isn’t going to be everyone’s cup of tea. But if the idea seems a little interesting to you, please stop by and take a look at what we have so far.

More information can be had by looking over the [charter](http://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicOfReddit/comments/kmy2c/charter_v3/) and the [republiquette](http://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicOfReddit/comments/kp1qo/republiquette_v3/ ""in case you missed it the first time"").

[Hello there, front page.](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/iem31/ever_wonder_what_reddit_would_look_like_without/)

I've mentioned it enough that most of you probably know by now about my suggestion to [kill karma](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/i84w5/can_we_start_treating_imgurcom_links_as_self_posts/) for links to the imgur.com domain. While everyone's mulling that over, I'd like to make another suggestion: **No Pics Day**.

Here's what I have in mind. We settle on a day and declare that No Pics Day. Any reddit communities that want to participate should announce their intention to participate. On the day in question, the mods put a message someone prominent on the page to remind everyone that their community is participating. Subscribers are discouraged from posting pics to that community, and voters will be instructed not to vote (either up *or* down) on images that get posted anyway.

Of course, there are communities where posting pics is the entire point. No Pics Day would be entirely opt-in, so those communities would naturally be exempted.^1

Likewise, individual redditors can participate on their own, regardless of what reddits they frequent. They'll just resolve to withhold their votes on images for a full day.

What's the point? To see what reddit would look like if it weren't dominated by pics. The goal should be to have one day with front pages filled with nothing but articles or text posts. Consider it a reminder of how informative reddit can be.

The date I'm suggesting is: **Wednesday, July 6th**. That should give us time to get everything organized and spread the word. In the meantime, let me know what you think and if you have any more ideas to make it work better. If this suggestion gets a lot of positive feedback, I'll suggest it in the mod reddits to try and build some top-down support.

**edit:** 80% like it. That seems like enough support to me. I've posted a request for participation over at [modhelp](http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/ie9og/would_anyone_be_interested_in_having_their/).

**2nd:** What's worse? That I got Wednesday's date wrong in two separate threads, or that no one else seems to have noticed?

The reason given is that it would better be suited for /r/ideasfortheadmins.  In nearly every case the submission would do extremely poorly there, specifically because of the question being asked or the discussion expected.  

As an example I will demonstrate the appropriate way to use /r/ideasfortheadmins 

http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/1aj4wi/it_has_been_more_than_a_year_since_advance/

I posted a concise description of a problem, and within minutes an admin responded indicating that the feedback was received and would be implemented.  Not only that they followed up within 30 days:

http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1dhw2j/reddits_privacy_policy_has_been_rewritten_from/

That's how /r/ideasfortheadmins should be used. Asking ""What impact would hiding the vote have on voting behavior?"" is not an appropriate suggestion for the administrators.  That is an idea that ""users or moderators"" can entertain and discuss.  Once a consensus has been reached the idea can be posted to /r/ideasfortheadmins and a link to the relevant theoretical discussion here can be added for context when submitting it.  

In-depth discussions about the impact of a theoretical change are rare in that subreddit.  You get ""this has been asked a thousand times, go away idiot"" or technical descriptions as to why it won't work or would cost Reddit, Inc. money to do it, or whatever.  But you don't get the quality discussion you get here.

Furthermore, since the reddit.com source code is available online, modifying the code and submitting a pull request is not outside the realm of what can be achieved by ""users or moderators"".  It is  common enough of an event that there is a badge available for reddit users who submit code changes that are accepted.  

When I have an idea about reddit, and I want to theorize about reddit, I come *here*.  This is the community for reflection and deep-thought, not /r/ideasfortheadmins.  Choosing the audience that you present your ideas to for critical analysis is essential.  You don't go to a technology journal to publish biological breakthroughs, just like you don't bother the admins with so much debate and conjecture that the simple and manageable request is lost in the din.  The place for discussion is here, and the place for well-thought-out *suggestions* is /r/ideasfortheadmins. 

Even the moderators admit the rule is overreaching.  When removing posts that violate this rule they often mention that rephrasing the title would make it appropriate.  Why would we abide such an arbitrary rule that would prohibit a thought-provoking conversation because of a technicality in the phrasing of their question? 

And to address the ""quality or effort of submission"" we can implement some simple rules to address that.  If you don't put forward a theory, at least one hypothesis, and it must contain text (no title-only submissions) then the post can be removed *and instead of saying that it is not appropriate here, the moderator can address the specific quality issues with the submission*.  This is how scientific journals handle quality issues, they have guidelines and they inform you that your submission did not meet their quality guidelines.  Being told that your submission is not wanted here is different than saying that it does not meet the quality guidelines.  Removing a submission for quality reasons and blaming it on the rule about the appropriate subreddit is illogical and a misuse of the rules. 

I know I'm not the only one that feels this way as I have seen many others complain about the rule in a similar manner.  I personally do not submit to /r/ideasfortheadmins (I think the above linked one was the first time I have), but I have plenty of theories about reddit I'd like to discuss with you guys.

That definition is kind of unclear, but hopefully you see what I mean. Some examples (and please note that most of these examples are ones that I was involved in, just because they are the ones that I have looked at the most):

**Very Successful**

* /r/AdviceAnimals: became a default after these memes were excluded from /r/Pics (and later /r/funny)

* /r/IAmA: became a default after Q and A type posts were removed from /r/askreddit

**Semi Successful/TBD if successful**

* /r/Doesanybodyelse: grew after DAE questions were banned from askreddit

* /r/Facepalm: grew after facebook screenshots were excluded from /r/pics, and later /r/funny

* /r/Games: this one is of particular interest, because it is the one situation where the new subreddit fills the same role as the previous one, not a narrower niche, and where the parent subreddit (/r/gaming) has not excluded any type of content. 

**Not so successful**

* /r/Defaultgems: Hasn't grown very much since /r/bestof decided to exclude default subreddit posts

* /r/CasualIAmA: hasn't grown much since /r/IAmA's rule changes made after I took over

* /r/Politicaldiscussion: Hasn't grown much since /r/politics banned the use of self posts. This may be because /r/politics later allowed self posts again, and then re-banned them, except for on saturdays.

So my question to you all is: what accounts for the rampant success of some, and the utter failure of others?

---

Some of my thoughts:

* The ones that have completely failed have been the most controversial, which makes little sense to me. If it the change is controversial, then it means that there must be interest in that type of content, which would lead you to think that plenty of people would subscribe. Is it that people think that by not subscribing, then the mods will undo the change?

* Related to point #1: the posts announcing the new subreddits and attempting to publicize them would not get as many upvotes if it is very controversial. [Here is the post announcing /r/politicaldiscussion: ~560 upvotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/j1bh2/new_rule_in_rpolitics_regarding_self_posts/). [The post announcing /r/games did about as well](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/metq6/announcement_rgaming_to_branch_into_two_separate), but then they made [a second one with memes to help people understand](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/mfsuj/announcement_rgaming_to_branch_into_two/), and If I recall correctly, subscriptions skyrocketed after that. The 2nd part of this, also apparent with these two submissions, is that a post announcing a rule change *AND* a new subreddit is less likely to take off than just a post announcing a new Subreddit. This is one of the reasons that /r/IAmA took off; the post (that I can't find) announced the creation of /r/IAmA, and only had the ""we'll be removing them from /r/Askreddit"" as an afterthought. 

* The /r/games ""persistent problem"" motivator. For this, I would like more examples to see if it is true, but one of the reasons that I think /r/games was able to take off is *because* the mods didn't fix the problem with /r/gaming. Every time someone complains about the quality of /r/gaming, then that becomes an advertiser for /r/games. Whereas with most of the splits, it is mod-enforced and the ""lower quality"" (in the mind of the mods) content is sent elsewhere, so no one complains about it anymore (unless it is unenforced). However, this doesn't explain why none of /r/Atheism's or /r/Politics' competitor subreddits ever took off; both of those are consistently regarded as poor quality, and yet a branch-off has never had much luck with either.

* Low quality content: the main reason that most of these are created is that the mods of the parent subreddit are trying to get rid of ""lower quality"" content, and that many of these just aren't successful because people don't necessarily want to see that subreddit. On the other hand, the two most successful offshoots (/r/IAmA and /r/AdviceAnimals) weren't considered ""low quality,"" just different from the intended purpose of the parent subreddit. The **clearest** example of this would be the oft-proposed ""IAmA Request"" subreddit. Requests tend to get upvoted, and people like the AMAs that result from requests, but people *constantly* complain about the requests themselves. We still allow requests because we know that no one will subscribe to the request subreddit, but we still want the AMAs that do result from requests.

It's been happening for a while. But I don't recall having talked about it here, and I think it's worth noting.

/r/AskReddit is narrowing.

Specifically, it's turning into AskRedditors. By which I mean, the questions that tend to be most popular there are questions about the opinions and background of redditors in general. And that holds true even when the question isn't explicit about being redditor-centered.

The two following submissions, for example, are technically about movies, but they're really about the opinions of redditors:

&gt; [What are some movies that are so bad, they're good?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nmj8q/what_are_some_movies_that_are_so_bad_theyre_good/)   
&gt; [What is your favourite fight scene from a movie? I'll start.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nmomi/what_is_your_favourite_fight_scene_from_a_movie/)

My favorite example from today? ""[On Reddit today I have been told that the US had the Shah of Iran deposed to install the current Islamic regime and that the USA is facing mass starvation just like North Korea. What are some of the most ridiculous things you've seen upvoted on Reddit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nmmdt/on_reddit_today_i_have_been_told_that_the_us_had/)"" Whoa, almost looked like that one was going to be about current events, didn't it? Nope, just ~~Chuck Testa~~ redditors.

A few exceptions get through here and there. An example from today's front page would be: ""[Here are 27 pro-SOPA major tech companies. Who has the names of other business supporters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nl9e0/here_are_27_prosopa_major_tech_companies_who_has/)"" But even those exceptions get by mostly be appealing to subjects that redditors take as their own, and SOPA is very much Reddit's pet project this season.

It wasn't always that way. [There was a time](http://web.archive.org/web/20080201153739/http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit) when the AskReddit front page was a more variegated mix of practical advice and topical inquiry in addition to the opinion solicitations. If you take a look at the new queue, you can see that questions of fact are still being asked in AskReddit, but unless they're specific to topics that already have broad currency on Reddit (like SOPA) they rarely ever make it to the front page.

But now there's something of a cottage industry in question-based reddits that pick up where AskReddit leaves off -- everything from /r/explainlikeimfive, /r/answers, and the Ask\* family of subs led by /r/AskScience. There's a dynamic relationship between them, such that most of those reddits were started in order to make up for the perceived lack of factual answers on AskReddit, and have in turn drained away what few fact-based discussions were still taking place there.

At this point, I can't help but think that AskReddit thrives mostly on two things: (1) its default status, and (2) the desire that many redditors have to treat Reddit as a kind of ad hoc social network. At the same time, AskReddit is one of the main subs encouraging the idea that Reddit *ought* to function as a social network. Without its default status making it an automatic subscription for every new user, I wonder how attractive most redditors would find AskReddit.

If you need more grist for discussion, a question that interests me (not least of all as a mod of another Ask\* sub, /r/AskPhilosophy) is that of how AskReddit can better delineate its function? How, for example, could it be better calibrated to serve as a launching point to other Ask\* subs that might be more relevant and useful to a given redditor's question?",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_nmsrf,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/nmsrf/askredditors/,

If they get fed up and leave, good. If they become even more determined and more malicious, well then that's even more justification to ban them in the first place.

I don't understand why they are allowed to stir up shit in smaller subreddits, but when given power in a larger subreddit such as /r/jailbait, they *ban the entire subreddit* instead of banning the individual mods. I just can't wrap my head around this.

Who the hell are these people, anyway? When I heard about them a few months ago, I blew them off as just a bunch of trolls who had a grudge against TwoX. Now apparently they have hit hueypriest's radar, but he has taken a completely batshit crazy approach to this (in my opinion). Banning an entire subreddit, and a pretty large subreddit at that, because of what the new mods *might* do, just seems like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

1366641378.0,86,self.TheoryOfReddit,1cv572,FindBostonBombers: Process Analysis and Lessons Learned,OhioFury,115,29,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1cv572/findbostonbombers_process_analysis_and_lessons/,"Now that the sub has been closed and the suspects are dead or in custody, its worth looking back on the process of crowdsleuthing and determining what about Reddit's first big crowdsleuthing effort worked and what didn't. I was a lurker on the sub when it was open, and I would ask permission to crosspost this (and the other two relevant analyses on this forum) there in order to get feedback from the original participants, but for now, this sub will do.

First, I think its safe to say that crowdsleuthing isn't going to go away. Speculation based on public information is just one of those things people do- every conspiracy theory , every time somebody's dad says ""its those Serbians again"" or whatever, is an example of low-information crowdsleuthing. What made this instance unique was the large amount of available information, in the form of images captured and posted by witnesses. To suggest that this kind of mass data can exist and that people will ethically refrain from examining it or drawing conclusions is silly. A voluntary ban on crowdsleuthing discussions by websites like reddit is as unlikely to succeed as a voluntary ban on spamming by mail servers. Ain't gonna happen.

So, strengths first:

1) FBB aggregated an enormous amount of data, mostly by submission from people who had already sent their images to the FBI.

2) Some of the analysis was very good- in particular the thread that identified the exact placement of the explosive device, using architectural markers and sightlines, and the thread that took a 9-minutes-pre photo and tracked the locations of several individuals to their immediate post-blast positions. This kind of dedicated image-tagging and interpretation is difficult, useful, and verifiable (i.e. more individuals participating increases the net accuracy)

Weaknesses next:

1) FBB did a terrible job incorporating new data into the existing evidence. Scraping the internet for anything related to the attacks turned up far too many false positives, and led to one innocent person being ""identified."" (I know, several other innocent people were identified, but other than this late-breaking missing-person conflation, the other innocents were fingered because of overinterpretation of legitimate data.)

2) There was a herd effect in which hypotheses that were already under consideration were overvalidated by discussion, while new or dissenting views were discounted. This led to two innocent people being identified in major news outlets as suspects based solely, I guess, on how much chatter there was about them on various crowdsleuthing forums. The amount of discussion is not the same as the accuracy of discussion!

Its worth pointing out that these are the same mistakes law enforcement and journalism make in similar situations. In fact, these are structural problems with data mining and group decision making. Problem #1 is a problem of externalities. Before Big Data, testing statistical inferences was a matter of systematically controlling for the problems created by small sample sizes and inaccurate measurements. Now, sample sizes are huge, and relevance is a bigger problem than accuracy. Put another way, everyone is suspicious- possible every single person in the suspect photo leaked to Fox had a kindergarten teacher named Joyce. Possibly everyone was born on a thursday. Given enough tests of this sort, some ""strange connection"" is likely to emerge, but while accurate, these relationships are totally irrelevant. The externality problem relates directly to how hard it is to be scrupulous about incorporating new data. &lt;b&gt;While a finite set of valid relationships exist between objects in a finite data set, there is an infinite set of valid relationships between those objects and things from outside the data set.&lt;/b&gt; Linking photos from the blast site to all other photos on the internet is a doomed prospect.

The second problem is less tractable. Although some models of group decisions are extremely accurate (e.g. the Condorcet Jury Model) these depend on independent evaluations of data. Once people are able to discuss their estimates of validity, systematic conformity and false consensus are big, big, big problems. There are computational models that can take this into account, to some extent, but not well.

Suggestions for the future:

Since this is going to happen again, I would strongly recommend that a set of ground rules be adopted *by moderators* well in advance of any crowdsleuthing activities. I'm suggesting these as additions to the set of ground rules that were established in FBB, not as replacements.

1) Maintain a very high index of suspicion for any new photograph, document, or feed that is not obviously evidence. Don't allow postings of high school photos, facebook profiles, similar blast sites from other countries, etc. The only time this was done well in FBB was the ""hat analysis."" Every other external photo damaged the validity of the evidence already assembled.

2) Atomize don't synthesize. Individual tags linking a person in one photo to their position in a second should be considered individually. Articles of clothing should be considered separately. ""photo dump"" threads, in which a mass of aggregate information is posted as a unit, make it difficult for ""the crowd"" to validate or invalidate component relationships independently. Successful group knowledge tasks look less like Encyclopedia Brown and more like Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

3) Tag the picture, don't bag the subject. Showing that a person is here, with a backpack, in one photo, and then there, without a backpack in another photo, is very useful information. Speculating on what that person's overall pattern of movement, or motivation, or identity might be is unverifiable and dangerous. Identify the correlation and move on- there are probably thousands of other data points that need correlated.

4) Let the cops do the copwork. All the big breaks in this case were accomplished by shoe-leather: the hospital interview with Jeff Baumann, the photo match with the driver's license database, the Lord &amp; Taylors and convenience store surveillance footage used resources not available to reddit now or in any likely future. By and large, the value of computers in data mining isn't data collection but data structuring- the collection still happens the way it always did in the past.

5) Send in the quants. I'm a student, not a pro. There exist models that can take in enormous numbers of observations and evaluations, examine the overlap and consensus, and return both confidence figures for the individual raters and for the collective judgments. The reddit upvote/downvote system seems almost perfectly adapted for this, but some kind of app or practice would probably need to be established in advance- maybe a bot that auto-votes? This isn't a question I can answer in detail. Surely, though, the people who turned poker from a game of gut feelings and ""tells"" into a zero-sum probabilistic number crunch can do something useful here.

I don't necessarily think that the 'new' reddit generation (people 6-10 years younger than I) should be prevented from sharing this information with each other - it's just boring to me because I already know most of it.

How would you control content?  How do you define what counts as an 'interesting' or 'lesser-known' bit of information?  I think there is a trend in /r/TIL for the truly cool bits of trivia to rise to the top, as they should, but they are quite rare and often quickly buried on the 'new' page by far more elementary stuff.

1372470100.0,81,self.TheoryOfReddit,1hacm3,Sensationalism and Politics: A Decline in Quality Over in r/news?,,108,27,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1hacm3/sensationalism_and_politics_a_decline_in_quality/,"Hello, all. In recent months, I've noticed a trend in r/news that I think deserves some discussion and consideration. I'm very new to this subreddit, but it seems like the best place to bring this topic up. The issue is this: many (if not most) of the top articles posted to r/news are heavily and blatantly editorialized, sensational, or political. Now, all of my observations on this topic are bound to be subjective and more informed by my own opinions on what constitutes news and reporting than any sort of hard data, so of course take my arguments with a grain of salt and remember that I have a limited perspective on a very large, very diverse community. 

That said, I invite you to open up a new tab and take a look at r/news right now. At the time of this writing, the top story on the subreddit is a piece about a UVA student who was allegedly mistreated by the police in her area. This, I think, is representative of an overwhelming trend of r/news submissions in past months: sensationalized submissions. Notice how the title (""Police pull guns on and arrest UVA student for...purchasing bottled water"") is deliberately eye-catching, including specific, shocking details (""pull guns on"") and an implied opinion (""for ...purchasing bottled water"") which naturally inspire feelings of indignation in the casual reader. Of course, the student wasn't *actually* arrested for purchasing bottled water, because purchasing bottled water is not a crime. This formula of ""Person was Arrested/Fined/Imprisoned for [Not a Crime]"" is absolutely pervasive in r/news. On the front page, the second, eleventh, 20th, 22nd, and 25th slots are all occupied by this type of post, many of them referencing the exact same story--a Texas teenager who was jailed for an online comment. So, on the front page of r/news right now, over 20% of the material is devoted to ""outrage"" stories about the abuse of the American justice system. 

The second trend in r/news submissions is the overtly political post. These posts are related to the sensationalist personal interest pieces in that they both depend on a sort of moral indignation or outrage in the casual reader. Of course, the NSA scandal has resulted in a veritable tidal wave of these posts, but even before that particular scandal r/news was a very politically driven place, with a wealth of political posts, often just opinion-pieces. On the front page of r/news, there are currently 10 political articles (40% of content, which could definitely be considered normal if not for the startling tendency of almost every article to have an implied or overt political opinion) with half of them being articles relating to the NSA or government surveillance in general. The ones that do focus on the NSA are almost all opinion-driven pieces focused on indicting the American government. Hell, on the right side of the page, in inches-high block letters, is a message for readers to ""Restore the Fourth"" (referring to the Fourth Amendment) and a link to r/restorethefourth. The actual formatting of the subreddit itself takes a political stance, leaving little room for dissenting opinion or, you know, actual news. At this point, a good deal of r/news now strongly resembles r/politics. I'm reminded of this image, included in a post about four months ago (which I found when trying to make sure that this topic hadn't already been discussed on this subreddit): [link](http://i.imgur.com/p2zxW15.png) . At this point, it doesn't just seem to be a question of whether or not political opinions have made their way into r/news, but a fact that the structure of the subreddit itself endorses one specific political opinion.

Given such a problem, I have to start searching for explanations. My first instinct was that r/news had grown so large that it became almost impossible to moderate, mob rule became a factor, and the quality of the posts went steadily downhill. But look at r/worldnews: over 3.5 million subscribers, almost five times as many as r/news, and still fairly free from the trend of sensationalized titles and low-quality articles. Could it be that r/news's American focus is leading it to be much more mired in American politics and prone to local personal interest pieces? Is it the fault of the mods for refusing to clamp down on editorialized posts and themselves showing strong political bias and activism in certain issues? Having only been on reddit for about a year, I still must wonder: is this a recent trend or an issue that's been plaguing r/news for years? Is this an extension of the ""activist-redditor"" mindset that compels certain redditors to indulge in the fantasy that they are affecting world events in real life by posting on reddit (see Boston bombing manhunt, SOPA, etc, etc.)? Could it be that the tendency of many redditors to upvote headlines and skip the actual news articles is facilitating this trend? Is this issue related to the problem of the 24-hour news cycle, wherein mainstream news organizations must fill an unlimited time slot with repetitious, low-quality, politically biased stories? Is it that r/politics and subreddits like it have desensitized redditors to the prevalence of politically-motivated news on our site, blurring the line between news and op/ed? Am I missing certain key factors which have contributed to this decline in quality? 

As you can probably see, this issue is not just confined to reddit but is affects our current, rapidly-changing news system. However, I would love to have a discussion on its particular causes and effects on reddit specifically. Hopefully, I've posted this in the right place--I would love to hear the opinions of people who are immersed in the theory of reddit and can help explain this phenomenon, which (I think) is more complicated than it appears.

If someone has a comment that is getting downvoted, be that something differing from the general opinion of the comments, or just someone getting/saying something wrong. People who acknowledge their downvotes, or question why they are getting downvoted, seem to get upvoted in that process. People will go from disagreeing with someone and downvoting them, (I know it is again Reddiquette, but very few users follow it), to upvoting them once the commenter has admitted they are getting downvoted.

Personally I won't ask why I am getting downvoted, and maybe reply to the comment saying I was wrong, whilst my first comment will be downvoted into oblivion, my second one will get upvoted for admitting I'm wrong.

The only problem I'd have with getting downvoted is that people wouldn't get to see my comment, since the default comment hiding score is quite low, maybe even sometimes people will just downvote a low score, without even reading what it has to say.

This may be completely arbitrary relating to the theory of Reddit, but it does get me wondering when I see it in action.

How do you guys react to downvotes? Question it, leave it, or something else?

When I first started on Reddit, submitting your own content was not only shunned but highly irregular. It was generally seen as attempting to game the system in order to make cash or whatever else, and not actually contributing. 

But it seems more and more that this attitude has changed. So much so that Authors are encouraged to post their works. Has reddit become so starved of original content that we'll change our views on content creators and what they should and should not submit in order to get a hold of it? 

Perhaps I am wearing some rose tinted glasses here, but if memory serves me correctly, people posting their own contents and asking for opinions would have been frowned upon. Instead the idea was that others found your content on the internet and if they found it interesting it was posted.

",TheresJustNoWay,115,37,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/ummqv/are_there_any_good_methods_for_attracting/,"I'm sure you are all familiar with the recent undercurrent in reddit towards ""depth"". This is reflected in the rise of places like TrueReddit, DepthHub, and affiliated subreddits. 

New subreddits that espouse these sort of more-refined intellectual values are probably popping up all the time, but there seems to be a sort of *critical mass* required to, say, get put on the sidebar of DepthHub (after which a subreddit could be said to have ""made it""). My theoretical question is, assuming a good fundamental idea and capable moderation, what are the methods and resources available to a new subreddit to reach this critical user-base? 

In trying to populate /r/Dialectic, I have taken the usual steps already: posting in r/newreddits and r/cerebral, as well as cross-posting in the ""parent"" subreddit r/philosophy. I have also PMed several people who have expressed interest in having philosophical discussions without having to worry about the amateur/ignorant demographic of the larger communities. 

But beyond these things, what is there to do? In order for a meme-oriented or otherwise lite-content community to take off, all it needs to do is keep attracting subscribers.

But for a *depth-oriented* subreddit, the problem is attracting **the right subscribers**, not just any subscribers. And there seems to be a sort of escape-velocity of participation required before the discussions therein are really interesting. As such, the problems of this sort of community are very particular. 

Any ideas or suggestions? Criticisms?

1335846172.0,81,self.TheoryOfReddit,t126q,"Default Subs - which are popular because people like them, and which are popular just because they're default",jambarama,108,27,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/t126q/default_subs_which_are_popular_because_people/,"In /r/science the question was asked why /r/atheism was a default sub.  The answer given that it was default because it is popular.  Of course that's circular logic, if \/r\/clopclop (NSFL) was default as long as atheism, I bet it'd have hundreds of thousands of subscribers too.  

I propose a better measure for popularity of a default sub would be the number of people who unsubscribe.  Defaults don't have the advertising problem that other subs do, so they all get about the same advertising exposure.  So say the number of people who unsubscribe from /r/atheism as compared to other defaults like /r/politics or /r/worldnews.  

For example, worldnews has about 200k more subscribers than politics.  They've both been default without interruption as long as I can remember, so that tells me politics is/was more disliked than worldnews.  

I know atheism was taken off the front page for a while, so you can't compare it to politics and look at raw numbers.  Luckily, thanks to the wonderful redditlist.com, we can compared it to other defaults - similarly sized and not.  Looking at the numbers, most default subs added ~55k new subs in the last 2 weeks.  Politics is a bit lower, TIL is a bit higher. 

You can see [/r/atheism is adding subscribers much more slowly than similarly sized defaults](http://redditlist.com/stats/atheism) (you can also see on the graph, for example, when askscience was taken off the front page).  To me, this suggests its default status explains more of its popularity than its subject.  

Of course newer subs will have higher rates of subscriptions because existing members will join up.  For example, politics has been around forever and been default forever, so not many members predate it that are still subscribing; atheism is similar.  AdviceAnimals might still be picking up lots of existing members.  Still, my impression is that most new subscribers are new accounts, not existing ones ""discovering"" politics or atheism.  

Do you think this is a reasonable way to evaluate the popularity of default subs?  

----------------------------------

Lets say I haven't made a silly logical mistake here, and my claim is accurate.  That's not to say atheism shouldn't be default, it is just to say it is more disliked than other default subs.\* So if this is a reasonable way to gauge the popularity of defaults, which ones are most popular?  Here's a list:

**Top 5 Default Subs** (sorted by most new subs, or fewest unsubs)

1. /r/funny
2. /r/bestof
3. /r/technology
4. /r/todayilearned
5. /r/pics

**Bottom 5 Default Subs** (sorted from fewest new subs, or most unsubs)

1. /r/atheism
2. /r/politics
3. /r/blog
4. /r/aww
5. /r/gaming

Interestingly, sorting default subreddits by most subscriptions doesn't line them up very well with either total size or activity.  

--------------------------------

\* Going for a least distasteful front page would make it very boring indeed.  Maybe the sub confronts many new accounts with uncomfortable questions, and they unsub as a result.  Maybe the tone of posters &amp; voters is offensive (as in all subs, the comments are better, but just).  Very likely, without default, atheism would have still been a large community, though not nearly the size it is now.

Then there's the ring of pedophilia subreddits. There's /r/pre_teengirls, /r/thenewjailbait, /r/malejailbait, and plenty of others where pedophiles can trade child porn with each other.

I'm not saying that they *should* enforce these rules (although I personally think they should).

If you're unfamiliar with what happened [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s5guk/iam_bad_luck_brian_ama/c4b8m3u) Karmanaut removed a post about a kid who was the subject of a meme because he felt wasn't interesting enough per the rules.

You'll find more of the same [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0r8l/ama_alfonso_ribeiro_carlton_is_my_stepfather/c4ik7b4),  [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t2at4/my_mum_is_a_pornstar_with_a_fairly_decent/c4iy2j3?context=3) and his user page shows that every single thing he posts is being massively downvoted.

Now I'm not looking to turn this into a discussion about whether the initial removal was correct or anything about his sockpuppets. I'm only pointing to this as it is a very high profile example of user outrage towards moderators trying to moderate. Which is something that occurs quite frequently and usually involves people calling mods power hungry and nazis.

What I'm curious about is if these constant overreactions to rule enforcement/changes (Im not talking about actual bad/corrupt mods) could have the unintended consequence of actually making moderators care less about what the users think. I think that it's a very distinct possibility. Especially if we see the kind of outrage being directed towards Karmanaut. Why would any human want to put up with that level of abuse?

Which leads me to my next thought, is there any way back? In these types of situations people like to ignore half of how reddit works (moderating) to push their idea that upvotes/downvotes are, and should be, the ultimate deciders of content. I'm in my early 30's so I grew up on an internet where forums didn't have votes at all and moderating was a pretty standard and accepted practice. Is there a way to get the staunchly anti-mod crowd to be more accepting of moderation?

It makes sense; as everyday there are ~~dozens if not~~ hundreds **if not thousands** of new Redditors, it would seem natural that since there are more users, there are going to be more upvotes. It's interesting when I look at posts I submitted over a year ago that made it to the front page: They tend to have 400-800 points. Now my posts that make it to the front page hover in the 1000-2000 range. Likewise, I remember when it was unusual to see a post in the default subs with 3000 upvotes. Then 4000, and now 5000 seems to be attainable for ""really good"" posts.

This made me wonder if it was possible to calculate some sort of ""adjusted for inflation"" formula to determine truly what any given user's ""best post"" was. Maybe divide the points of a post by the number of users in the sub on the day it was submitted. Or maybe divide the points by the average number of active users that day. I don't know what an accurate way would be.

In a similar note, all this got me thinking about the nature of karma in general. While obviously not really worth anything, people like having karma. But is your karma relative? Of course it is. If everyone else had 10,000 and you had 1,000, you would feel like you were behind. But if everyone had 100 and you have 1000, you would feel ahead. So, by the logic that the value of your karma is based on the relative amount of karma of all users, doesn't it technically *decrease* the value of your own karma when you upvote someone's post? Much like how printing currency without destroying any decreases the value of that particular currency?

I'm not really asking anything in particular, these are just things I've thought about lately. Thanks for reading!

EDIT: I thought some more about it and came to the following conclusion: 

If the total number of upvotes that are given on any given day exceed the number of new users* who join Reddit that day, the value of karma decreases. Inversely, if the number of new users who join Reddit on any given day is greater than the total number of upvotes given, then the value of karma increases.

*The definition of ""users"" is debatable. Obviously this doesn't include throwaways who technically join all the default subs, but only submit one post in their lifetime. I think it would have to be someone who ""actively Reddits"", but I'm not sure how to define that either.

I call it TheBoredMan's Theory of Karma Relativity.

Edit 2: For people who are saying I'm wrong, I think you might reading into it too much, so here's a super simplified example: Let's say on day 1, there are 10 users in all of reddit, and they each have 1 karma. So that means that YOU have 1/10 of the karma out there, and you also represent 1/10 of the ""population"" of Reddit. 1/10=1/10. But that night, two more users join reddit. Also, during that night, 3 people upvote posts (that aren't yours). So now there are 12 total reddit users, and 13 total karma. You now represent 1/12 of the population, HOWEVER you only have 1/13 of the karma. So, relative to the population, and total karma, *your* karma has essentially decreased in value.

The community has some interesting challenges that this change affected.

1. Persistent minor invasion from vandals who violate the community policy and are normally severely punished with down-votes.  Due to this change, people could no longer do that.

2. The community is pretty liberal, and conservatives who start threads are often punished in their own comment sections, so they end up getting a permanent post timer when they show up there and make a submission that's obviously conservative, and end up at -100 for the day.  The change was an attempt to address that, but the community seems to have cared more about the previous point.

3. The community hard a large atheist minority, and sometimes a comment would meet with enough approval from them that it hit +4, at which point the Christians could pound it into the dirt.  This was a little weird.

We'd be interested in hearing anything anyone has to say about this or other attempts to try to protect minority opinion on Reddit.

If someone wants to examine our comment sections in order to try to evaluate this, anything that's been active over the past week or so should reflect the results of this sytem.

I think for the larger image subreddits, such as /r/pics or /r/funny, this would help quite a bit. If it had a time limit of a month or two, it would let old content come back after some time, possibly after giving a warning or notification to the poster.

Just an update on [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/phe2v/whats_tors_opinion_on_harrassing_trollbots/) which was discussing what to do about the CAT_FACT_BOT (and similar) that were picking out users to harass with spam.

CAT_FACT_BOT has now [been deleted](http://www.reddit.com/user/CAT_FACT_BOT), but in its place the same user has created BOOM_DICK which is [even more annoying](http://imgur.com/QQUIs).

I know a fair number of people were getting harassed by this bot, so I just wanted to pose the question of if there was any long-term solution that could be thought of to deal with this type of user: if their bot accounts get deleted they are free to just register another account and resume the spamming.

Maybe we need a [/r/reportabusivebots](/r/reportabusivebots) subreddit in addition to /r/reportthespammers (they weren't able to help with CAT_FACT_BOT because it's not technically spam). I'm tempted to start one.

**Edit 2**: a user claiming to be the author of the bots has replied, saying [he's turned them off](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/pkrjj/update_on_cat_fact_bot_and_more_problems/c3q9uia). He [goes on to say](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/pkrjj/update_on_cat_fact_bot_and_more_problems/c3qaa1t) that he's planning something bigger, and then [goes on further to say](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/pkrjj/update_on_cat_fact_bot_and_more_problems/c3qah3f):

&gt; I am now going to make piles of bots that do random things that are not spam and just found to be annoying

*facepalm*

**Edit 1**:

So I just wanted to mirror the message I've sent to admin hueypriest r.e. user [1637](http://www.reddit.com/user/1637) . I'll post any replies or advice I get back.



----

&gt;Hey hueypriest
&gt;
&gt;Sorry to bother you, 
&gt;
&gt;- User ""1637"" is writing bots to harass users, and maintaining a 'target list' of specifically who to target, [on which he takes suggestions for victims](http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/ozjow/curl_reddit_login/c3lefhp).
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ""Feel free to send me usernames via MSG and I will put them on the target list""
&gt;
&gt;- The first was CAT_FACT_BOT (more details at [/r/reportthespammers](http://www.reddit.com/r/reportthespammers/comments/pb2xc/overview_for_cat_fact_bot/) ), which tracked a set of users and posted cat facts at them each time they commented (on any subreddit).
&gt;
&gt;- This went on for two weeks: there was a discussion about it at [/r/theoryofreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/phe2v/whats_tors_opinion_on_harrassing_trollbots/)
&gt;
&gt;- That eventually got blocked, but now he's running one called BOOM_DICK which [spams anyone who said they reported his bot with ""DICK"" comments](http://imgur.com/xZS9T).
&gt;
&gt;- This user is an [abusive troll](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pjeog/reddit_what_is_the_meanest_thing_you_have_ever/c3pxqtx) deliberately using the Reddit API to annoy users: 
&gt; &gt; ""I created a Reddit bot CAT_FACT_BOT and had it follow around 51 people for 12 days and counting posting cat facts on their comments. wait naw that's not even close to the worst thing I have done...""
&gt;
&gt;Lastly, he's targetting me especially because I wrote to him to ask him to stop CAT_FACT_BOT and then, later, to tell him his bot was deleted. I got this reply:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; oh no! Something I don't care about and was a old beaten into the ground joke has been deleted off of the Internet I'm so hurt. I really don't give a dam **but I am going mess with u now**.
&gt;
&gt;And that's when BOOM_DICK started :(
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I don't know if anything can be done to prevent him creating bot accounts &amp; spamming/trolling people he doesn't like, but I wanted to report it anyway.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for reading, apologies for the long message but it's been a bit of a saga!
&gt;
&gt;Cheers, Frenger
&gt;
&gt;---
&gt;
&gt;NB: 
&gt;
&gt;- I'd post this at /r/reportthespammers, but they told me they didn't have any power to get rid of CAT_FACT_BOT, so I imagine it's the same for BOOM_DICK bot as well.
&gt;
&gt;- I would use RES to block him except I access Reddit mostly from AlienBlue on my phone.

I have seen it to different degrees and about different aspects in all of my defaults, and the different role each plays creates many different stances.  The increased traffic and interest in the subject makes each issue we face have an even larger than normal audience, and people's feelings give it greater weight.

The last time I felt this intensity in moderating issues was leading up to the US presidential election.

So today this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1clidn/28_migrant_workers_working_at_a_strawberry_farm/) makes it to the front page. The user /u/wonderbra6 has only posted one time, and their only post made it to the front page. They linked to a story on neurope.eu. I decided to check out /u/wonderbra5 and turns out they also have only submitted one link 2 days ago [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1cgey7/google_fined_in_tokyo_over_autocomplete/) and sure enough it was a link to neurope.eu. Now there is also a wonderbra3 and 4 that have not made a submission yet, but I am willing to bet in the next day or two they will be submitting a link from neurope.com. The wonderbra accounts were all made at the same time 2 days ago. 

I did a search for links submitted with neurope.eu as the URL and came up with plenty of results http://www.reddit.com/domain/neurope.eu/ Now the interesting thing is how many of those links were submitted by brand new users with no previous posting history, and no posts since the one they made linking to neurope. Here are some examples of users who only posted neurope links:

http://www.reddit.com/user/YoWix

http://www.reddit.com/user/Ninja_Jam

http://www.reddit.com/user/josh71

http://www.reddit.com/user/stancho_

http://www.reddit.com/user/CryptoManz

http://www.reddit.com/user/AlphaBravo_

And those are just out of the first 15 results on the search by domain. There are 5+ spam brand new account submissions to every regular poster linking to neurope. I am sure if you keep going down you will see more of the same. New accounts with only one post link to neurope, some of them with random names like snian,yowix,ciciazqm and so on. In RES you can hold your mouse over the usernames on the domain search results page and see how many of them linking to neurope had never posted before or again after submitting that one link. 

So is it neurope trying to get hits, is it a marketing team or hired spammer, or is it possible all these people just registered one time to link to them and never post again? Once again I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit, but as we can see today every so often one of their submitters with a brand new account makes the front page and drives to them tons of traffic.

This year, the admins [decided](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/14cha9/community_best_of_2012_awards/) to let each subreddit run local best of events, explaining their reasoning [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2012/comments/14cj96/greetings/c7c04lm). While there were mixed reactions to this, I think that it gives an opportunity to recognize the best posts in this community in meaningful categories, rather than appealing to the lowest common denominator.

Since this is a discussion-oriented subreddit, an eligible ""post"" can be either a submission, a comment, or a thread where one user contributes most to the conversation.

Please nominate best posts in the following categories. You are encouraged to comment on nominations, restarting good discussions we had in the past.

1. The most informative, insightful, and well-written post that helped you understand reddit better *[informative]*.

2. The most well-researched post that required a significant amount of data gathering, analysis, or non-trivial background knowledge *[well-researched]*. Gathering, visualizing, analyzing data, using examples from reddit history to support an argument, looking at other social sites and aggregators for additional insight, and more.

3. A post that had, or will have, the biggest impact in making the community better *[constructive]*. In part, /r\/TheoryOfReddit exists to satisfy our own curiosity how reddit works, but it has always aimed to be constructive and improve moderation, user behavior in individual subreddits or across them, discuss how new and existing tools such as wiki, CSS, and bots could be used to improve communities.

Sadly enough, the hivemind that displays the ""average redditor"" has formed this site into a sort of all inclusive club. Sound confusing? Well, let me try to explain.
I apologize for the following wall of text, but there is a TL:DR included.
We have the Reddit hivemind for two reasons, with the latter being much more prominent;

1. Same opinions.

2. Want of inclusion/ recognition.

In social life, people often do things in purpose to look ""cool"", or to be included in social happenings, and this trend is also found on Reddit. Going back to the theme of task and reward, the reward in real life social situations is interaction or desired social status. The Reddit standard, however, is much simpler: Karma.
Thanks to the karma system, people can pretend that having popular opinions (or at least pretending to) has merit. We've given people a whole new way to validate themselves. People probably wouldn't post their opinions in such ferocity (r/atheism) or in such magnitude (r/politics) if there wasn't a reason to do so. Without stimulation to post to something, they would likely not. Because what's the point? Nobody could show support outside of comments, and no records would be kept. Things would be local.
TL:DR: Karma stimulates people to post, and the want to feel accepted is what drives circlejerks.

I saw it come to a head today before logging in, I saw [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1abmbq/dear_ratheism_bashers/) post. Now, I am not subbed to /r/atheism, however it is a default and my curiosity got the better of me before I had managed to log in. I want to iterate, I am using /r/atheism as an example, because it is such a great one. 

For a while, I had subbed to a subreddit called /r/debateachristian. There was so much potential for great discussion on the grounds of it being an open forum. I grew up christian but became agnostic as I got older. I loved to have conversations there and enjoyed the actual depth of the debates. Now heres where /r/atheism comes in. It is not how they talked, many debated greatly and I had an amazing time. It was that many people would come into these forums and simply downvote and berate many posters.

With this behaviour, I have unsubbed. I bet many others have too. It was simply a toxic enviroment brought on by people seeing this bashing on the front page constantly. I'm wondering if this is brought on by the fact that you get instantly downvoted if you try to counter anything said in /r/atheism, even if you are well written and sourced. This goes against the grain of reddits purpose of downvotes. Just because someone believes in such a way does not justify dismissing the post, it should stand on its own merrits and be downvoted if not informative, pertanent, or thought through. This is just fine in that subreddit, but more and more I am noticing it spilling over into subs dedicated to religion and religious discussion.

Let me say this once more, before I get a large amount of rage from someone. I am not bashing /r/atheism. I do not care what they do in thier sub. I am wishing to discuss the toxic nature of the ""spillover"" effect that subs involving personal issues have.

My point is this. Do you think that major subreddits can kill or damage smaller subs if the mindset of /r/atheism spreads out to other large subs? Is this something we can even do anything about? What do you think drives users to this behavior? And in particular to /r/atheism, do people think beratting others will change how people feel about them or thier belief(I'm sure this could apply to other similar situations)?

One of my favorite things about reddit when I first discovered it was how easy it was to collapse comments and therefore group discussions into easy to read (or not read) sections.

Gradually they began to let you sort them by 'best rated', which often provided some additional insight or in some cases even provided proof that refuted some point in the actual article.  Recently there's been a new jump forward.

Well, what's popular isn't always good. That's part of the reason subreddits like TrueReddit are created. I suspect that oftentimes posts are submitted to /r/bestof because they have 1000+ karma in a current front page'd AskReddit thread. I hope the content of /r/bestof will improve.

**Methods** 

I scraped the moderator lists for the 25 subs /u/meneth identified for his analysis of the ""top 25 subreddits"" and developed an edge list to be turned into a network graph, increasing the weight of each moderator-moderator edge by 1 when they shared a subreddit in common. Then I dropped all edges that had a weight less than 2, passed this into a network analysis tool, ran a community detection algorithm to colorize the graph, and sized the moderator nodes according to their degree (the number of other moderators in the graph that they're connected to).

Here's the [code](https://gist.github.com/dmarx/5936250) I used to scrape the moderators if anyone wants to extend this analysis to the top 100 or 1000 subs using stattit.com or something like that.

1353648268.0,70,self.TheoryOfReddit,13nlb8,"Presenting statistics, vote tracking and comment thread profiles. On the subject of ""invasions"" and ""brigading""",SnapshotBot,89,19,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/13nlb8/presenting_statistics_vote_tracking_and_comment/,"In light of recent increased attention to ""brigading"" by meta subreddits I've decided to share some results gathered from one of my bots.

It is programmed to take ""snapshots"" of threads, placing them into an ""album."" These ""albums"" are then automatically bulk processed to generate infographics which illustrate voting behavior and the ""personality"" of comment threads and subreddits. 

When a meta-subreddit links to a thread the bot creates an album with it's first snapshot. These snapshots contain the following information among more: 

 1. General information for the linked and linking subreddit and submissions (age, name, text)
 2. Either every comment in the thread or submission if the submission is sufficiently small
 3.  Vote totals on those comments
 4. A list of commenters who's profiles indicate that they are members of the linking subreddit, but *not* the linked subreddit, with their posts.

With all of this information in one album, information can be pulled and presented from them.

My two favorite so far areas follows:

**I will be omitting information such as thread name and linking sub from these examples because this is not intended to direct accusations towards meta-subreddits**

I will also be using short term, recent examples for illustrative purposes because my older ones are harder to read. 
___
**Horizontal Bars**

Generates two data sets from two snapshots including any significant comment score. This yields a votes profile for the thread and illustrates the trend in how this voting profile is changing. The upper lip represents positive votes and the lower lip represents negative votes. Comments are only included if they exist in both snapshots. 

The blue is the old snapshot and the red is the new snapshot. Where they overlap the bar is purple. Thus red indicates a continuing trend, blue indicates a reversed trend. 

This is a ""typical"" voting profile. Large upper lip, votes trending in the same direction, very few reversed trends:

[Typical Voting Profile](http://i.imgur.com/1YAai.png)

Deviations from this pattern typically indicate something about the thread. More on that later.

___

**Slope Diagram**

^(*These are automatically generated so tags overlap sometimes, I'll work on it*)


So the horizontal bars intentionally give zero context on *what* is getting voted on. I think these slope diagrams are neat because they help recognize how the opinion of the viewing population is changing. Either because they are changing their minds, or the population is changing. 

The bot plots the 10 (or otherwise) most voted on comments, which will usually be close to the top 10 comments if nothing weird is happening. 

[Here is a typical slope diagram where nothing noteworthy is happening](http://i.imgur.com/iyiWQ.png)

___

**Deviations from these trends**

Where's the fun in any of this? It's when trends get wonky.

[Threads with huge lower lips](http://i.imgur.com/i42QN.png)

It makes you wonder what's being said. Some profiles have way more downvoted posts than upvoted posts. They usually indicate a silly slapfight where everyone in the thread is making a fool of themselves. 

[Here's another thread from /r/creepyPMs](http://i.imgur.com/rRs0O.png)

Notice how weirdly similar the trends are? When the same trend keeps emerging in subreddits, it usually indicates something about that subreddit. 

Ok, so notice how every single comment is continuing in the same direction? That means the general views of the voting population is not changing. 

[This is what it looks like when the voting population's opinion changes](http://i.imgur.com/9VdIr.png)

This particular thread from /r/fitnesscirclejerk was entirely upvoted, then when it was nearly three days old, the voting trend started reversing. A lot of blue is common when a meta-sub links to a thread it widely disagrees with. 

[How about a thread that was **30 days old** and got linked?](http://i.imgur.com/3Luba.png)

It's not typical for the vote count in a 30 day old thread to double in the course of 1 day after it got linked. 

Slope diagrams indicate the opinions that are reversing. [Here's a slope diagram where you can really easily tell the opinion of the new voters](http://i.imgur.com/M69A3.png). Again sorry about the overlapping tags, the bot places them so I have to work on it. 

So these are the typical thinks I look for:

* Upvotes vs. Downvotes 

* Reversal or continuation of trends

* Are more upvotes increasing than downvotes decreasing?

* Is the magnitude of new votes congruent with the age of the submission?

**More?**

I really appreciate any comments or suggestions. This project was originally just to help me teach myself programming. I've had nearly no programming experience prior to this so I needed a way to keep it interesting. 

I am considering setting up a subreddit to post these results and allowing mods to message the bot and have it add albums at request so the updated plots can be pulled later. I think it would allow mods like /u/Jess_than_three to get a better idea of what's going on in [situations like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/139hz6/meta_analysis_of_vote_brigading_on_a_recent/) automatically.

Now, I extended these investigations by taking a deeper look into the development of Reddit. I could investigate that not surprisingly, the number of submissions, distinct subreddits and distinct domains used is rising over time. However, the percentage share of self (text) submissions is rising in comparison the submissions linking to external content.

I also investigated which kind of subreddits and domains get the highest score on average for frequently submitted subreddits or domains. In the following you can see the top subreddits (min. of 10,000 submissions):

http://i.imgur.com/DUsVlw1.png

Interestingly, the subreddit /r/4chan is winning in this category by a large margin.

Some users will say that reddit's best days are behind it, and others will say that reddit has just started. I was thinking of ways of reddit and realized that my only really large qualm was the difficulty of finding great subreddits.

Think about it for a sec. If you're in this subreddit (/r/TheoryOfReddit) then you are probably a more serious reddit user, that didn't come here for the image macros or the funny text, but for the great stories, moving videos, and promotion of progressive ideals (Not in the political sense, but in the ""further myself and the world around me""). You probably have your set of favorite subreddits, ranging from 20,000 subs to 3,000,000. As a consensus, we say that the medium sized subreddits offer the best content. Too big and just fluff floats to the front page (see /r/AdviceAnimals and /r/funny), too small and there just aren't enough posts to go around (see /r/Gangstanimals and /r/SurpriseAppearances). The thing is, these two subreddits would have a lot more content and posts if people were able to find them. 

Your main source of finding new subreddits is from either someone mentioning it in a comment or post (Look at this bunny! (bunnies with legs)) or that you are just dicking around and type something in the url (Hmm pics of dead kids? /r/PicsOfDeadKids ? WTF why does that exist)

There are 3rd party sites, such as metareddit and stattit, but being 3rd party they are only for the more hardcore users that want to expand their sub list. Also, since they only have access to reddit's API, they can be mediocre at best. There is no really great way of finding new subreddits.

Take, for example, a subreddit I found yesterday. /r/happycrowds. This subreddit has the most potential and great content I have seen on reddit since I got here. It's posts are fun and it has begun to get a decent userbase which posts semiregularly (I would like to say 1, maybe 2 posts a day on average). Please note I'm not doing advertising for this sub, I just want to show it as an example.

I'm sure that the majority of reddit would probably sub to this subreddit if only they knew it existed. /r/happycrowds did get featured on /r/subredditoftheday, but that still only gave it a minor bump. 

What would help reddit more than any other single change or addition is the ability to see subreddits that are having 

* good content posted regularly

* A growing userbase

* a set of active mods *and* users

Most importantly, however, reddit would merge all of your subreddits into one swirling list and compare it to what other people with similar interests have. It would then base recommendation based on your subs. I would imagine this as an Amazon Recommended Products type bar on the bottom of your screen, with a sample post from the subreddit, the description, and the sub name.

Over the last week 3252 posts from 135 subreddits have reached the top 100. These have been posted by 2889 users and link to 327 different domains.

**/r/all vs frontpage**:

Posts from the 3 most popular subreddits (/r/funny, /r/AdviceAnimals and /r/pics) spend less time in the top 100 of the frontpage then in the top 100 of /r/all, most visible for /r/funny. http://i.imgur.com/K6CRNvv.png

Probably due to the frontpage algorithm dividing the top spots between the 20 default subreddits, which is also visible when looking at the maximum position a post makes in /r/all and the frontpage. http://i.imgur.com/mYyhfD2.png

The 20 top posts are somewhat evenly distributed between the 20 defaults subreddits.

**upvotes vs downvotes**

Upvotes and downvotesm are generally linear dependent, except for posts with few upvotes, which have relatively few downvotes. http://i.imgur.com/7jXiPOp.png The most voted post in the last week (not in the graph due to /r/blog not having enough top 100 posts) is [the post of AaronSw's death](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/16h4aa/aaronsw_1986_2013/) with more then 90000 total votes

**upvotes vs comments**

There are 2 clear different trends for the number of comments a post gets: A very steep somewhat linear trend for /r/AskReddit and a way less steep linear trend for the rest of the subreddits. http://i.imgur.com/xmijuQM.png
The large outliner from /r/AskReddit with 6000+ comments is [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16hllb/what_pranks_would_you_pull_if_you_were_a/) post.

**Comments and votes at different times:**

A [number of upvotes per minute](http://i.imgur.com/1eemkYb.png) clearly shows the time most redditors are active is the afternoon in Europe and the VS.

The [number of comments per minute](http://i.imgur.com/HKreZAM.png) shows the same story and a very successful /r/AskReddit posts made at around 17:00 UTC.

The [voting behavior for NSFW posts](http://i.imgur.com/taBYAea.png) shows that NSFW posts are, as expected, most popular relative to SFW posts later during the evening, with an interesting peak at 16:00 UTC which I can't explain.

The [comments on NSFW posts](http://i.imgur.com/X7wC5LA.png) show a different story, but that large peak can be explained by [an NSFW /r/AskReddit posts](http://i.imgur.com/trQus8k.png).

For instance, only your link karma is put next to your name on login, and it is put first on the karma listing on your page. These are relatively subtle distinctions, but they nonetheless encourage the perception that one type of karma ""matters more"" -- hence behaviors like submitting images of text, rather than text.

____

**EDIT 2:** Just to reiterate so everyone understands what I'm getting at.

What I'm asking is why *reddit.com itself*, and not just its users (but perhaps by extension), emphasizes link karma over comment karma (and how in some places, comment karma isn't even invited to the party) in its interface choices. This is a question about reddit's design. 

______

In other words: why are comments not presented by reddit as having the same ""content merit"" as links?

If anything, I think comment karma should be emphasized *over* link karma. Link karma only rewards a good broadcaster. Comment karma rewards a good Samaritan. Links are system participation; comments are community participation. 

If reddit (and not RES, although awesome) put *both* link karma and comment karma aside users names, then would not most problems associated with link karma seeking be tempered? Especially if comment karma was put *first*?

Why does Reddit chose only one type of karma to get the first class treatment?

Inspired by [Wikipedia’s bot policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_policy), I think it’s time Reddit started regulating bots.

Bot regulation would be more effective if implemented by the administrators, but I’m posting here rather than in \/r/IdeasForTheAdmins because ToR has [discussed bots before](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/search?q=bots&amp;restrict_sr=on), and I think this is more in line with that than with a simple feature request.

----

To start with, bots should be flagged as such for the benefit of both man and machine. As on Wikipedia, running bots on an account not flagged as such would be a no‐no. Having multiple bot accounts owned by the same person for identical purposes (to make blacklisting them more difficult) would be forbidden as well.

At the moment, the only way for subreddits to block bots is to blacklist individual accounts. Forbidding bots from using multiple accounts makes this a more useful option, but I propose that subreddits be allowed to ban all bots and whitelist only those they approve of.

As for how to enforce bot flagging, three possibilities immediately come to mind:

1. Reddit’s servers could detect bots automatically. Formulaic comments or posts are the main clue, but access patterns could aid in making the decision. Downsides include additional load on the servers.

2. It could operate in the manner of /r/ReportTheSpammers, with a group of trusted persons acting on reports. Downsides include additional work for these trusted persons.

3. The bot flag could be assigned automatically if enough users report the bot. Downsides include potential for abuse. Potential for abuse could be lessened by combining option 3 with option 1 and only flagging bots that objectively demonstrate automated behaviour.

----

As I said, bot regulation would be most effective if the administrators were involved, but a mod‐level alternative would be to curate a list of bots (I suggest making it a trans‐subreddit effort) and have a moderator bot ban them from subreddits accordingly.

I believe there is a limit on the number of accounts a subreddit can ban, so the list would probably need to categorise particularly active or problematic bots. This would require more work on the part of the curators and poses potential political problems.

There is also nothing stopping those who run intentionally problematic bots from creating new accounts to circumvent bans, which is one reason an official bot policy would be nice.",,False,,t5_2rtff,1356103052.0,,,True,t3_1586yk,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1586yk/should_reddit_regulate_bots/,

Ideally, I want to redo this with more robust models and data, so I'd appreciate any and all thoughts, whether it's harsh criticism or new ideas on where I can take this!

**How Perceptions of Anonymity &amp; Audience Affect Massive Online Communities: An Application of Social Information Processing**

*In the past decade, with increased use of the Internet, massive online communities such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube that comprise millions of users have emerged and their platforms have gained widespread adoption around the world. As users share information with networks of other people, how does the ability to connect with 
thousands or millions of unknown others impact how a user presents aspects of his or herself? Additionally, if a user is to share personal information with these large audiences, does the user’s perception of anonymity within a respective sociotechnical system impact how they self-present? This study draws from social information processing theory to examine how the potential audiences of and perceptions of users’ anonymity on Reddit.com, a massive online community that embraces aspects of anonymous communication, impacts selective self-presentation of those users. The findings show support for certain audience sizes and self-presentation techniques related to particular sociotechnical contexts and affordances of a massive online community.*

EDIT:

*tl;dr*

*Audience size only predicted the tiniest bit of perception of anonymity in a subreddit (but didn't for the front page). Only using a throwaway account was predicted from perceptions of anonymity (but again, was very small).* 

*In a pre-test analysis, it was interesting to find that perceptions of anonymity didn't actually differ between genders.*

*In the post-hoc analysis, another interesting thing to note: how long you use Reddit predicts perception of anonymity.*",,False,,t5_2rtff,1360007738.0,,,True,t3_14bvxk,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/14bvxk/i_wrote_up_a_study_on_perceptions_of_anonymity/,

I've actually found it kind of interesting to look at how this meme and others affect popular reddit culture in a similar way.  
  
[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/upnau/overly_attached_girlfriend/) was posted around 9am on 7 June (we'll call this ""epoch"") and quickly shot to the front page. It got tons of attention with 20k redditors voting on it, and even more seeing it presumably. This is how most start, with high visibility by the whole reddit community. It quickly gained a following, with multiple recaptionings as is seen with any popular meme. Many of these made it to the front page as well showing the community how lucrative it is for karma.  
  
This is the interesting part: other memes come out of the wood-works. It no longer stays confined to the meme itself, but there becomes a meta-meme culture. One of the first of this is a spin-off meme about [OAG waking you up in the middle of the night.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/upsar/overly_attached_girlfriend_wakes_you_up_at_300_am/). It had a similarly sized audience and was posted about two hours after epoch.  
4 hours after epoch, [crazy girlfriend praying mantis](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/upzhb/this_new_meme_is_too_ironic/) makes a comeback after being considered by many to be a dead meme. 5 hours after epoch, [a picture of a woman pops up with a caption about how she's less clingy than OAG](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/uq1vw/you_had_your_chance_now_youre_stuck_with_a_psycho/). ~~The thing is, a tineye search shows that this picture hadn't been captioned before.~~ 6 hours after epoch, another picture of OAG is captioned, but this one of her with her mouth open looking like a crazy person: hence the title [Insanity Girlfriend](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/uq70y/insanity_girlfriend/) as a spin-off of insanity wolf and OAG.  
  
It didn't just bring memes to life, it also boosted the popularity of bad luck brian, why not zoidberg (a meme that hadn't been used in a while. an interesting correlation is the posting of a hypno-toad meme to /r/adviceanimals), and annoyed Picard.  
  
This isn't confined to just this meme either, it's happened before, and it still happens on a lesser extent. For example, a meme entitled [good guy tribal chief](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/upo8s/good_guy_tribal_chief/) is captioned with the words ""let me play you the song of my people."" An hour later, [scumbag church](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/upplw/scumbag_church/) is posted with the punchline ""let me play you the song of my steeple"".  
  
I find it interesting how this happens so often on /r/AdviceAnimals. I've also seen it happen occassionally between /r/askscience and /r/shittyaskscience which is always good for a laugh. Do you think this is common in other subreddits that aren't comedy based? Is that even possible, or does this self-referencing culture lend itself only to funny subreddits?  
  
**TL;DR: Advice Animals acts as a meta-meme making madhouse most made noticeable when over-attached to overly attached girlfriend.**

Let me know if there's any other similar data you're interested in, or if you'd like to take a look at the data yourself, here's the two tables (which you'll have to use together):

2. [List of moderators with their subreddits](http://steam-punk.net/moderators.csv)",,False,,t5_2rtff,True,,,True,t3_o75r7,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/o75r7/data_and_statistics_for_moderators_of/,
1315807925.0,66,self.TheoryOfReddit,kctfk,"Men use Reddit, women use Tumblr.",,119,53,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/kctfk/men_use_reddit_women_use_tumblr/,"To say the least it's a broad generalization, but bear with me for a second.

Essentially both sites serve the same function— share random bullshit you find on the Internet, syndicated by other people— but Reddit still maintains a highly male majority of users. This isn't 1999 anymore; pretty much everyone under the age of 30 uses the Internet to dick around and share content. Bearing this in mind, it's odd, to say the least, that Reddit is so male-dominated.

On Reddit, content syndication is aggregated and averaged. The votes represent the average, and there's very little filtering done (the only filtering is which subreddits you decide to join, but even then they're averages of those users). Now on Tumblr, all of the content on your newsfeed goes directly through your friends and other people you're following. Content isn't an average of anything; it's hand-picked and completely individualized.* 

Because content syndication on Reddit is all just an average of the user base, it's really no surprise that marginalized groups are *extremely* uncommon on Reddit and much more common on Tumblr. Yes, everyone has a voice on Reddit, but what's always represented is an average of all the voices. On a site like Tumblr, every voice has a small say on your dashboard. To offer an analogy, if you roll a die once, every number 1 through 6 is equally likely (this is how Tumblr works). But if you roll a die 10 times and average the results and present that as your final number, the result will almost always hover around 3 and 4 (this is how Reddit works).

Because Reddit caters to average, majority groups, this creates a feedback loop in which Reddit becomes even *more* average. I don't think either method of syndicating content is superior (Reddit vs. Tumblr), but one of the biggest problems with Reddit's method is that Reddit doesn't appeal to marginalized groups whatsoever. For example, I know many a female who have been extremely alienated by this community because Reddit is already majority male and content averages out to represent a male experience. On the flip side, it seems like the majority of Tumblr users are female, in part because those females can create their own little ""safe spaces"" by very carefully controlling who they follow.

Worst of all, this is one way how Reddit fosters such sexism and racism and other shit that I know many people wouldn't be able to get away with in real life. The Reddit community is essentially isolated because people on the fringes of life stay away from here. On Reddit, you're more likely to get away with racist jokes and sexist jokes because, well, nobody will get personally offended! That's just an example, though. The main issue isn't with overt things like ""get back in the kitchen, woman"" but subtle things that make marginalized groups uncomfortable. For example, comments that imply that men only want sex and nothing more may be OK to other men but can alienate women, even if it's only unintentional.

Unfortunately I'm not sure what can be done about this. I think the best and perhaps only solution is for Redditors to acknowledge what position they're in, and try to make the community cater to all types. Unfortunately that's more of a platitude than anything, but I can dream, right?

Anyway, I know nobody really cares about this but this is somewhat of a farewell post. I'll probably be back in the future and also to respond to comments in this thread, but for now I'm just fed up with this site and the sexism and racism and witch hunts and I want to step back for a while. And I just wanted to share my thoughts on what might cause these things.

If you hadn't noticed yet, the moderaion team of /r/bestof [recently decided to ban default subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/y3ufx/rbestof_results_of_the_no_defaults_experiment/). This means that what I like to call the ""/r/bestof effect"" is going to become a much more common phenomenon, since smaller, non-default subreddits will be the entire focus of the subreddit from that point forward. This brings a welcome boost in subscribers and traffic to new and struggling subreddits, but what happens when an already volatile community suddenly has a large group of new users who probably don't know the local etiquette and quite possibly don't care to learn? We may be about to find out.

I'd like to talk about /r/SubredditDrama once again. I've been very hesitant to broach this subject in the past, due to the tendency of any such discussion to derail into, well... drama. However, with the recent changes in moderation here, notably the moderation team which has more than doubled in size as well as our policy regarding comment moderation (rule 4), I think we *may* be able to keep this discussion on point. I know that TOR and SRD share a large amount of subscribers (I myself subscribe to *and moderate* both subreddits), and I think our two communities are hopefully mature enough to discuss this topic without the comments section deteriorating into a flame war. If it does, our moderation team should be able to quietly escort the rowdy patrons to the door.

Why am I talking about SRD and /r/bestof in the same post, you may ask? It's because [SRD was recently linked to by /r/bestof](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/yp2j0/in_a_thread_which_exposes_how_certain_reddit/) and received a [substantial amount of traffic and new subscriptions](http://i.imgur.com/iIpqw.png) as a result. As you can see, the subreddit gained almost 700 subscribers on a single day, a significant increase over the usual daily growth of 100-200 users. On the same day, the moderation team announced they were [banning users who repeatedly interfere in linked threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/yplap/meta_posting_in_linked_drama_brigading_and_other/) after they have been submitted, which a small portion of the userbase (and a few of the mods) insist is a problem.

So, my fellow theorycrafters, this is what I would like to discuss: 

* Do you think the influx of users from /r/bestof will assimilate to the culture of /r/SubredditDrama, or do you think it will simply add unrest to an already volatile situation? Do you think there is a possibility of more bestof/srd crossovers in the future, or was this simply a fluke? If the trend of large traffic spikes continues, how long do you think it will take for SRD to reach 100,000 users? How do you think the culture of the community will change at that size, if it changes at all?

* Does /r/SubredditDrama affect the threads it links to, and if so, in what way? Is there really an interference problem, or is this simply a case of a vocal minority making a mountain out of a molehill? If there is a problem, do you think this new policy will have any effect? Furthermore, do you think there will be any unintended consequences?

* Do you think there is a good possibility of /r/bestof sending traffic to other meta subreddits in the future, for example /r/WorstOf, /r/MetaHub, /r/ShitRedditSays, or even /r/TheoryOfReddit? If so, which ones would be the likeliest? What effect, if any, do you think it would have on the smaller community?

This originated as a letter of statement but I ask that you consider it as an instrument to think out loud. What can and should be done by the community to steer these interactions going forward? There is a more constructive way for outside parties who wish to use reddit for their gain to interact with us directly. Share how you think we can help them contribute to our community and in turn potentially help them contribute to their cause. 

----------------------------------------------

An Open Letter to Public Relations Firms &amp; Media Who Want to Use Reddit and the Internet

Are you a public relations firm, media group, celebrity, or entrepreneur who wishes to use Reddit for your gain? If so this post is for you. Let me begin by welcoming you to Reddit... well maybe I should begin by welcoming you to our home. This strange place on the internet, this place that you recognize as a hotspot for information and trends, is something many of us consider to be our home. We come from different backgrounds, socioeconomic groups, races, and ideologies to congregate in a single spot called Reddit. 

Your person or company has sought us out for several reasons: You want to influence us, you want to sway our opinion, you feel we can be a powerful tool in your hands,  and maybe you think you are smart enough to get what you want from us. Your entity sees the possible potential of such a massive person driven machine just sitting here “going to waste”. This is a common and growing trend as corporations and groups do their best to dig their tendrils into online groups that are primarily driven by their communities. Its nothing to be ashamed of because you want influence which turns to profit and power. I don't know anyone who wouldn't want to have a sizable community on the internet to feel warm and fuzzy towards them. The problem we have here is how you go about getting that support from us.

Once upon a time, in a time not yet past, all you had to hear on the radio or the nightly news was an adamant statement and it was taken as fact . Entire families would clamor around these sets to listen to word across the country, dare even across the planet, and it would be the talk of the town for days and weeks to come. The Walter Cronkite's of the world were legendary and their word was tantamount to gospel. Fortunately and unfortunately that time is passing for many reasons but most of all I believe it comes down to three main points: The realization that there is a gross exploitation of media for profit, the recognition of ideological parity that is being shoved down our throats, and the common human desire to express ourselves in an honest and truly free way.

Everybody has heard the argument for the first two reasons listed but few focus our essential human desire to express ourselves in an honest and truly free way. It has been seen since before civilization even began: Cave paintings, fertility idols, epic poems, fireworks, literature, videos, music. All of this is information. Information is consumed, disseminated, regurgitated, torn to shreds, taped back together, and passed around again for the world to see ad infinitum. 

This sharing, these acts of spreading information in ways and forms that no one person can completely articulate, is what makes us human. These actions are done every second of every day, consciously and unconsciously, and no matter what construct we have before us that wants to disseminate information to us we are biologically bound to spread that information ourselves even more. At this time it has resulted in online communities, online voices, of what the internet embodies today. It is truly the embodiment of a biological imperative taken to heights that few have ever dreamed of.

This innate desire, this need, to share information through our person has resulted in everything mankind has ever dreamed of and one of those things is Reddit. Reddit is just the name for this place. It is a phenomenon that is a common enough sight to see but it is uniquely essential in every way imaginable. I would like to draw comparison to a quote from the movie Full Metal Jacket:

&gt;”This is my rifle. There are many others like it, but this one is mine. My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my rifle is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy, who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will. Before God I swear this creed: my rifle and myself are defenders of my country, we are the masters of our enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.”

Before someone goes out on a limb and mistakes my intentions with this quote let me put your concerns to rest. To me this quote expresses that a “gun” is the extension of a “soldier”. It is no longer a tool that can be discarded but a piece of one's own being. This is what Reddit, and greater what the internet is, to many of us. The internet is an extension of our person and it is a piece of what makes us human. Reddit just so happens to be the name of this extension of ourselves. 

These pieces, these communities, that we are so intricately tied into come and go. Today it is Reddit, tomorrow it may be Reddit or it may be another community that has not even formed yet. These communities are not concrete, they are not fixed points. Communities will rise and fall like men have risen and fallen. As we grow this community grows, as we change this community changes, as we die this community dies. So when I say that your efforts to co-op, to control, to manipulate our community are not well taken I make that statement as someone who is personally effected by your action. 

When outside forces come in and do their best to weasel into our communities and sway opinion their favor it is not tolerated. We do not believe that is acceptable. You can have an opinion, you can have a goal, and that is typically fine for the most part so long as you give back to the community at least what you take from it. Do you want to promote or market something on Reddit? Then do so in a way that is relevant to our community.

To be relevant in any community one must first understand the wants and needs of a community. Think as a decent human being, do not think how you can slip under the radar and manipulate the situation, and realize that being relevant is enough here. [A prime example of relevancy for several types of situations arose and are explained in this article here](http://www.dailydot.com/news/ups-reddit-pr-disaster-debbie-curtis-magley/) If you read the article you will see that a potential public relations nightmare turned out to be an easy to make mistake, a public relations win for UPS, and an expression of problems on many consumers' end to a receptive company audience. Essentially Debbie Curtis Magley of UPS not only entered what could be considered a war zone, as someone representing a company that many have had issue with in the past, but left being considered as someone on the upper level of management who actually did their job by allowing for an outlet where customers could vent their frustrations to someone who can actually do something about it. If you haven't yet read the article I'm telling you to open up a new tab and read it. The point here is lost if you can't be bothered to read the article. 

What Debbie Curtis Magley had here was the human touch. There wasn't some hammed up effort by UPS to try to placate an audience so they would shut up and go away. Make no mistake that is exactly what many companies, public relations firms, and marketing outlets are seen as doing. Why is this the case? Because its exactly what you are actually doing. People are sick and tired of being told that an apple is an orange. This kind of behavior just does not pass for par anymore. That era of obfuscation in customer service is dying. If companies and entities cannot give us straight answers then we will turn to sources who will. Give people the cut and dry truth and you will be surprised how many people will be willing to understand if you speak to them like they are human. Of course there will always be unreasonable people who will never settle for an answer they do not like but you are coming to realize just how large of a group we are compared to that unreasonable minority . Either change and grow to meet our willingness to help you help ourselves or face the brunt of our expression.

I know its hard, its expensive, it requires resources and preparation to figure out how to handle the situation. Most of all it takes time and time is what results in money. These are all excuses every person has said and heard when it comes to looking to solve an issue they believe to be bigger than themselves. But if you have done your due diligence and taken the time to learn about our community you will know by now that we are even incredibly inclusive to parties we do not particularly like. The key is civility and mutual respect.

There's [an item on theAtlantic.com right now](http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2012/02/kim-jong-un-looking-at-things/100237/) containing nothing but a bunch of pictures of Kim Jong Un looking at things. This thing has been posted on /r/funny, on /r/pics, and on [/r/worldnews](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/p6bsd/kim_jong_un_looking_at_things_pics/).  ([see duplicates](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/duplicates/p6bsd/kim_jong_un_looking_at_things_pics/))  It seems appropriate for any of those places. 

But why doesn't/shouldn't reddit allow a person to post it once and tag it, like many blog or community sites do?  One post, one discussion, tagged with three distinct tags. 

Changing reddit to use a tagging metaphor would virtualize each reddit.  Most of reddit would look the same, but we wouldn't have the ""islands of conversation"" effect that we have now.  We also wouldn't have the cross-posting phenomenon. 

A visit to [/r/pics](/r/pics) would still present all the posts tagged with ""pics"".  A mod on [/r/pics](/r/pics) could still remove a  post if appropriate - it would amount to removing the pics tag from the post.  If the post was still tagged with some other tag, it would  still show up on that other reddit.  Removing the last tag on a post would effectively orphan a post, and it would then not show up on any reddit.  

Creating a reddit would still look the same. You'd still need mods.  Subscribing would still work the same. Custom CSS would work the same.

Up/down votes might need to work differently.  Suppose a post is tagged with 2 tags - one belonging to a million+ reddit like [/r/worldnews](/r/worldnews), and another belonging to a smaller reddit like [/r/rva](/r/rva).  Suppose the post garners attention in worldnews, getting 340 upvotes in an hour. This will quickly propel it to the top of [/r/rva](/r/rva), drowning out any other rva-only posts.  This seems like a solvable problem, though. One way to address it is to just live with it. If that's not possible, then it might be possible to employ some simple algebra to normalize the relative in-reddit rankings. 

Another issue is the headline. On some reddits, there are particular requirements for a headline. On the news reddits for example, headlines need to be factual (eg, /r/worldnews or /r/news).  In others, creativity within the headlines, or exhortation to action is encouraged.  In video reddits, there's a requirement to include the length of the vid in square brackets [43:22]. I don't have a good proposal for how to reconcile this at the moment, beyond - *just tolerate it.  A post's headline must conform to the reddit rules for every tag the posts bears.*  

When someone posts a duplicate link, they'd still  get the familiar ""that post has already been submitted"" warning.  If a person posts a link that has already been posted, but not with their tag, then their tag gets added to the set of tags.  In this case, again, there's an issue of voting and credit accrual.  I'd propose that only the first poster gets the points, for any post, regardless of which tags he attached to the post.  

The main advantage to tagging would be to interconnect the various reddits, via stories of shared interest.

It seems to be the consensus view that subreddits have a tendency to become dominated by image submissions. This domination will not abate anytime soon. It will become stronger over time because the tools to make image content are becoming more accessible, and also because the domination of images creates a positive feedback loop. I'd like to throw out an idea that I think would solve the problem.

What I propose is a checkbox in each subreddit sidebar labelled ""Include image submissions"". It would be checked by default, and if the user unchecks it, it would filter out all image submissions from view in that subreddit.

It is three-quarters of the way to just giving each subreddit its own image section, since you can view images by just checking the box. This would also allow a parallel community to exist within each subreddit, consisting of nonimage submissions, giving them some breathing room.

Note that no moderation is required for this to work. And for those that like their subreddit how it was, they can leave the box checked and to them,  everything will appear the same.

I'm aware that introducing filtering options has downsides. You want users to downvote stuff, and if their content is too filtered, they may not even see the submissions that need downvoting. But I think this filtering is coarse enough so that this cost is minor, and would be massively outweighed by the benefits.

All in all, I think this would be a great boon to many subreddits. It would give a way for discussions and nonimage-links to survive instead of being 
crushed by image submissions. There is a lot of angst out there about the domination of certain types of image posts and so I think there is a real demand for something like this. 

I submitted this idea to /r/ideasfortheadmins [here](http://redd.it/i9a05). If you support this idea, please give that an upvote to increase the chances an admin will see it. If you don't support this idea or support it provisionally, I'd be interested to hear a critique.

&gt;Do you spend your night on something you already love doing or do you attempt that thing you've always wanted to do but never did?

&gt;What props and other supplies will you be needing to successfully complete epic night out?

It's interesting to see reddit take this creative approach towards advertising.  I see it as a probe to see how the community reacts and one that shouldn't meet much (if any) resistance.  It is certainly a good match with reddit's demographics - Simon Pegg and friends.  

The wording could be better, though.  Why dance around the subject of corporate sponsorship?  Most redditors get it that the site needs to make money to survive - why not simply get that out there?  It seems like the dancing done in the announcement reflects the nervousness behind advertising.

I would be very interested to see how the RedditGifts exchange fulfillment percentages have changed over the years.  Early on it was about the reddit community and trust.  With volume has come a groundswell of ""I never received my gift"" comments.  How much is the system being gamed today versus in the past?  Are the percentages the same - it's just that the volume is higher so there are more that give but don't get?  Definitely more people gaming the system than in the past?

It seems like the reddit userbase seriously misunderstands the purpose/meaning behind some of reddit's mechanics, and that seriously affects what shows up the on the site.

Starting with the nsfw tag: Pretty often there is controversy about over-use of the nsfw tag. The issue with that controversy is that for people at work, they lose a lot from under-use (accidentally being seen), but they barely lose anything from over-use. If they skip all nsfw posts, then they aren't going to run out of material to view, so over-use is just erring on the side of caution. However, the userbase that isn't viewing reddit in public places finds reason to complain about the overuse of the nsfw tag. It doesn't affect them, so why do they protest?

Because of this perceived controversy, mods suggested introducing separate nsfw(nudity) and nsfw(gore) tags. From the perspective of someone in a public place, this separation doesn't make sense. We are rarely going to find a boss who is okay with someone viewing gore but not pornography, or one who is okay with viewing pornography but not gore. People browsing reddit in an airport or a coffee shop who also want to avoid nsfw material also aren't really going to differentiate between the two.

It seems like now that the nsfw tag is established and commonly used, the userbase is starting to misunderstand it's purpose. Why separate between nudity and gore? For their viewing pleasure? They seem to get the impression that the tag exists for them to personally categorize material, rather than for its more literal meaning.

The exception here is when people post 'NSFL' material, and in those cases it's often clearly stated, or follow-up comments state it. Again, for someone in a public area, there isn't much of a difference between nsfw and nsfl material, but some viewers try to avoid nsfl material for personal reasons. I consider that a separate (and maybe legitimate) issue.

I consider this misunderstanding pretty influential in reddit's culture. If tools are introduced and then changed for improper reasons, we get variations of those features that end up serving no purpose, and just existing out of convention.

A bigger issue in how we perceive meaning in reddit tools and features is in how we use upvotes. I'm sure it's established by now that users treat points as something of value rather than as a tool for sorting quality. When we understand why it exists, we use it with that purpose, but now users are upvoting for reasons other than ""Other redditors should see this"".

Now, the criteria is closer to ""I like this"" or ""this made me laugh"" or ""this is clever"". A good example of this is when there is a post making fun of some tragedy. In the comments section we find variations of ""That was terrible but you made me laugh, I'm not sure if I should upvote you"". It's absurd to see, because their decision shouldn't be guided by either of those. Making you laugh isn't a criteria for an upvote, and being of bad taste might not be a criteria for a downvote.

This isn't a problem with power users or with users who feel good about having a lot of points, instead it's just a misunderstanding over what the voting feature is for. I don't know if it would help to start promoting the idea of ""upvote if you think others should see this"" though, because usually the portion of the userbase who cares is a minority.",,True,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_1d4rkk,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1d4rkk/misunderstanding_of_certain_tools_specifically/,

It is claimed to be a ""place to showcase reddit’s community, culture, and history"" and to introduce Reddit to those whoa re unfamiliar with it. So far it is relatively sparse, but it provides an overview, in a sense. Certainly it will look different in the near and far future.

But what /about represents is an explicit attempt to answer an important question: what exactly *is* Reddit? Ask fifteen Redditors and you will get fifteen responses: some people use Reddit to share memes, others use it as a newspaper, and still others read comments for funny or informative discussion. And there are those who argue that Reddit's purpose is to be all three, to be an engine for organizing communities, rather than any specific community.

But up to now, some of the definitions have been winning out: especially over the last year, Reddit has been viewed as a place for cat pictures and memes, a competitor to 9gag, and a site not known for quality content. Others view Reddit as a place for, say, trolls and porn and things that might not be the best image to present to others.

So it is unsurprising that this sort of rebranding would happen. But what might the results be? Will it succeed? I suspect it's unlikely to backfire, but it will be relatively unknown in the future unless emphasized in other ways to new accounts^1 or something else interesting happens. Think about how many other websites' about pages lie about, unread.

1: I'm not sure /about is the best way to orient new users. It doesn't give a very good practical idea of what a subreddit is, nor does it provide avenues for subreddit discovery, which I believe is the best way to get a user to maximize their enjoyment of Reddit. Ideally, it would also explain some conventions on Reddit or maybe point the users at the FAQ or /r/help. Nonetheless, it is better than just casting them out into the storm, and I am sure /about will change and improve.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_uos89,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/uos89/the_announcement_of_rabout_suggests_attempts_to/,
1331826463.0,69,self.TheoryOfReddit,qxw97,Why don't people link to primary sources? ,,86,17,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/qxw97/why_dont_people_link_to_primary_sources/,"I've always wondered this. Mainly in the technology and science subreddits, which, as of right now, do not contain a single imgur link on their respective front pages, there are very few primary sources linked to. Now, with original content, in the form of reviews, etc. this is not an issue. But things like information about the new Anonymous OS, hard science content, research papers, etc. are filtered  through blogs and news websites which require an extra click before seeing the actual source material, which means that we, as the public, don't get to make our own decisions about the important points of the article and discuss it among ourselves, but instead end up discussing whatever the article or blog post writer writes.

There's one other commonality between the two front pages: out of fifty links, DrJulianBashir has 11 of them. Assuming it is one person operating the account, your looking at one guy driving a lot of traffic from these subreddits. Further, and I haven't done anything to substantiate this besides inference, the links seem to go to the same places. 

In [/r/science](/r/science), DrJulianBashir seems to like to link to physorg, medicalxpress, newscientist and arstechnica. And as he goes, the subreddit goes, with one notable exception: theatlantic, which is also linked to quite often.

In [/r/technology](/r/technology), there are many more sources, and types of websites, but its still mainly blogs that then link back to primary sources. Take the top link, about the google engineer complaining about google. It's not actually a link to the blog post by the Engineer, it's a link to blog on money.cnn.com, where the author of  *that* blog post editorializes and therefore frames the discussion as being more about Larry Page (current google CEO). Larry shows up once, briefly, in the original blog post, and doesn't take on the veneer of evil mastermind but natural choice for google, which the author ascribes motives to as if it were its own entity. But, after the herping and the derping of the top comment, the first thing the comments focus on is Larry Page. 

Now, I'm not saying there's anything nefarious going on. I certainly don't think DrJulianBashir is getting paid to run traffic anywhere, or anything like that.

What I'm more interested in is the... almost preference of people to have a viewpoint taken on something before they are allowed, in a vacuum, to form their own opinions. A blog post before a paper frames the issue for you in your mind. Do people like this? Do they like not having to form their opinions on their own?

And what does this mean about Reddit? Besides the imgur links and all that jazz, are the large reddits, even the large ones that post content, are the large reddits just news agregator agregators, in the end? What's the point, outside of the coment sections, of visiting the front page of [/r/science](/r/science) when you could just go to theatlantic, physorg, or arstechnica and get the exact same thing?

Maybe it's the convenience of not having to form your own opinions: a heavily upvoted article should be worth your time, right? And if it's not, you get the delicious taste of superiority that comes when the top comment completely debunks or dismisses whatever is being reported on.

I don't know where I'm going with this exactly. I seem to have spiraled a little bit here. So let me close, by summing up some things:

For the people who don't comment, is Reddit just a convenient way of getting websites they like in one place? If so, is the guise of pre-approval what makes it popular over simple things like RSS feeds to favorite websites?

For the people who do comment, is it easier if you have basically an uber-comment, that is to say, the intermediary (the blog post) that stands as the middle man between you and the primary source, that makes you feel good as it gives you an opinion to agree with or rail against?

1326751234.0,66,self.TheoryOfReddit,ojuzs,Is /r/politics really as bad as everyone on reddit claims? I don't think it is.,goodbetterbestbested,118,52,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/ojuzs/is_rpolitics_really_as_bad_as_everyone_on_reddit/,"I don't think there is much wrong with [/r/politics](/r/politics) as it is right now, especially compared to other online political forums. I have three main points to make: 

1. the discussion on politics is not nearly as invective as people make it out to be, and in most instances is in fact quite civil and entertaining; 
2. people get the impression that /r/politics is extremely combative because people are very sensitive about their political opinions and are unused to having them challenged, so the impression is that any criticism or conversation that doesn't 100% support their view is ""rude"" 
3. /r/politics does have a left-wing bias, but that is because reddit is a community-building web site, and the community of people who happen to be interested in reddit happens to be generally left or left-leaning.

Let's start with (1), and see what happens when we sort the top 5 threads on  [/r/politics](/r/politics) (of a month ago, when I took these screenshots—not selected because it was a particularly polite day on /r/politics but merely because that is when I got the impetus to document it) by ""best"" and look for this name-calling, harassment, and generally juvenile behavior:

[14-Year-Old Girl Calls Out Rick Perry in Iowa on Gays in the Military: ""Why do you want to deny them their freedom when they’re fighting for your rights?""](http://i.imgur.com/jtYoA.jpg)

The top couple pages of all of these threads contain no real combative language or insults, with the [possible exception of GyantSpyder's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nirim/sopa_will_mean_the_end_of_reddit_says_general/c39i15k) in the SOPA thread. Obviously, one is able to find occasional instances of rudeness and name-calling in /r/politics. However, I don't think the incidence is much higher than in other subreddits devoted to discussion of issues, and even if it is somewhat higher, that is to be expected in a political forum and **that is not a sign of some kind of dysfunction. It is merely a sign of the heated arguments political topics tend to produce.**

(2) That brings me to my second point. When you post something in /r/politics, you are likely to get a response both because politics is a very hotly debated area of human affairs and because /r/politics has a great number of users. Someone out there is bound to see your post, disagree with some aspect of it, and feel compelled to respond. Some of these people will be less than civil. But most will merely be providing a different point of view.

People inherently don't like to be challenged on deeply-held beliefs. There is a reason for the expression ""don't talk about politics at the dinner table."" It will usually end with heightened tempers, even if the discussion itself is completely civil. **When you are challenged on your deeply held beliefs, you will be much more sensitive to perceived rudeness than you would be on other topics.** This leads in a community like [/r/politics](/r/politics) to a collective sense of incivility, even when, if you step back and compare it to discussions elsewhere on reddit, it's really not all that much worse. It's just really easy to hate on political discussion in our culture generally and feel somehow ""above"" politics by doing so, and reddit is no exception.

And compared to [political forums](http://www.freerepublic.com/tag/*/index) elsewhere on the internet, or even the comments sections of [major newspapers](http://www.washingtonpost.com/), /r/politics is a shining beacon of civil political discourse.

(3) That brings me to my third point. Reddit is envisioned by its team not just as a content aggregator, but also as a community creator. The thing about communities is that they tend to rally around a consensus point of view about certain topics, based partly upon the beliefs of the individuals making up that community and partly upon the discourse that exists in the community as a whole. The line between this kind of communal consensus and groupthink is fine, but not all community consensus is groupthink or ""circlejerking."" Those are disparaging terms used by people who fall outside the consensus and feel that their viewpoints are not adequately represented.

On a web site like reddit, where every single user has the ability to make another person's viewpoint more or less visible, this is a real problem. But it's not a problem that is peculiar to /r/politics. And **we shouldn't be surprised that a web site like reddit, which appeals to young, cosmopolitan, technologically-savvy types, tends to attract community members who are politically to the left of, say, Rick Perry or Michelle Bachmann**. The political demographics of the world and the structure of reddit just doesn't allow for /r/politics to become some place where every single ideological position has an equally visible say.

And you know what? I'm okay with that. People in /r/politics do not follow reddiquette, but damn near no one else on reddit does either. And some opinions are so poorly supported, even though they are ""mainstream"" (see: opposition to equal rights for gays and lesbians), that it's hard to imagine a post that would add to the conversation.

Let's also not forget that [/r/politics](/r/politics) doesn't exist in a vacuum. To some extent, the left-wing ""bias"" in /r/politics is a response to the right-wing bias in the mainstream media environment. Even then, the bias in /r/politics is exaggerated. There are many instances where a misleading headline or article has shot to the top of the subreddit, and the top comment in the thread (at least sorted by best) is a correction. And let's not ignore the love Ron Paul gets in /r/politics, even though many of his policies are more ""right-wing"" than most Republicans.

**tl;dr—[/r/politics](/r/politics) is not nearly as bad as people on reddit make it out to be and it's probably one of the more civil political discussion boards on the internet. There are features of reddit and human nature that make it ""feel"" more incivil than it really is.**

I believe this is due to the explosion of Reddit enhancement suite. It isn't very difficult to imagine 500k+ users using RES (I believe they get nearly 150k downloads per month.)


Any other thoughts or any other mods notice a drop in their traffic?

##About TheoryOfReddit

 &gt; Theory of Reddit is a mildly navel-gazing space for inquiring into what makes Reddit communities work and what we in a community can do to help make it better. 

Please keep this in mind at all times, we are not the to go subreddit to [complain about stuff](/r/circlebroke) or [talk about drama](/r/subredditdrama).  **Be constructive!** If you perceive a issue that annoys you that is alright, but when visiting TheoryOfreddit you should be prepared to think in solutions, not problems. 

##The wiki

**Almost the [entire wiki is editable](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/wiki_protocol) by our regular users!** Regulars are any user with an account older than 90 days and who has accumulated at least 50 subreddit karma. 

  - We do welcome user contributions since a lot of knowledge is gathered here but also lost since it is hard to search for. With the wiki we aim to fix that and every helping hand is welcome!



##On moderation 

   -  We are still ""TheoryOfReddit"" so questions without theories will be removed. 
   -  Unsure how a good /r/theoryofreddit post would look like, but eager to make one? Just read through the sidebar and use every item as a checklist. [There is also a guide to be found on the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/submission_guide). A good look at [our top submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/top/) and their common elements can be very useful in forming a general idea about this.
   -  We can't mention it enough, **posts that include things only the admins can do will be removed.** /r/ideasfortheadmins is the subreddit for posts that require admin intervention. 
        - This does include ""what if"" scenarios that still require admin intervention to be executable.
   - We do actively remove comments that are bigoted, racist, and otherwise derailing. Keep this in mind while commenting.
   - [Bigoted and racist usernames will be banned](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1066cx/we_have_a_new_sidebar_rule_usernames_containing/).

Furthermore, the data exhibits the steady grwoth of Reddit via the number of submissions.

**The current issues with reddit moderation**

Possibly the single most significant issue with moderating on reddit is that we don't really have *moderation* tools. We have *anti-spam* tools (and very limited ones), which we are forced to try to use for moderation when it's necessary. This often makes things difficult, since every time a moderator approves or removes anything, their subreddit's automatic filter tries to ""learn"" from that, and changes its behavior a little towards future posts from that user/domain, or with similar words in the title.

This is especially problematic when applied to sites that allow user uploads, like imgur and youtube. For example, someone may post an off-topic youtube video in your subreddit, which should be removed. But by doing this, you cause the spam-filter to increase its bias against *all* future submissions from youtube, on-topic or not. So now it's more likely that youtube submissions will start being filtered, and a moderator will have to watch the spam queue and approve legitimate ones. Removing that submission also adds a fairly strong bias against the submitter, and even if it was an honest mistake or had to be removed for some reason despite being a valid submission, it becomes quite likely that all future submissions by that user will be filtered.

This is basically a never-ending battle, and makes reddit moderation an extremely tedious task. Especially since many users don't even know how to tell when their submissions are filtered, and unless you unfilter them soon after submission, they'll already be pushed far down the new page and will receive much less attention. So to have a ""well-moderated"" subreddit, you generally need extremely active moderators that can be checking the new page (for spam/offtopic/rule-breaking posts), the spam page (for incorrectly-filtered legitimate posts), and the reports page and mod-mail very regularly. Note that this activity is not really ""moderating"" a lot of the time, it's just being there to correct constant incorrect decisions by the automatic filter.

**Automating the job**

Most of these ""corrections"" that a moderator has to make are extremely straightforward. Check the domain, maybe check the user, see if some obvious good/bad keywords are in the title, etc. So about a week ago, I started building a bot that could be could be configured with ""conditional actions"", where it would watch these important pages, apply the defined conditions to any new submissions, and perform actions if the conditions were met. It's been functional for the last few days, and is currently being used in 7 subreddits, to different levels of complexity. It can be added to any number of subreddits, with each subreddit having its own conditional actions, which can be set up on the following attributes of a post:

* The domain and full URL of the submission (which includes determining if a post is a link or self-post)
* The submission's title
* The submitter's name, account age, comment/link/combined karma, and whether they have reddit gold
* The text of a comment (currently, comments have to be reported for AutoModerator to check them)
* Which specific meme a post is, if it's on quickmeme or memegenerator (I don't know if this will be useful for any other subreddits, but in /r/gaming we only allow certain memes)

All of these conditions can be defined using [regular expressions](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Regular_expressions), which allows for defining *patterns* instead of just specific things. They can all also be combined in any manner, and can also be ""inverted"", where anything *not* satisfying the condition will be removed/approved.

This allows for many capabilities that are currently impossible, but have been requested many times by moderators. Just a few examples:

* Completely banning domains - e.g. /r/gaming doesn't allow URL-shorteners, so AutoModerator will remove any new submission from tinyurl.com/etc.
* Removing ""suspicious"" domains from new users, but allowing them for more established users - e.g. people often register just to spam their blog, so posts from *.blogspot.com can be removed from new users, but allowed if older users submit it.
* Restricting domains/titles for subreddits with strict submission rules - e.g. /r/bestof has a constant problem with people submitting from domains other than reddit.com, which should never be done there, or for subreddits that require all submissions to have a ""tag"" in square brackets. Anything not matching the condition could be removed, and anything matching approved (spammers usually don't try to follow the rules).
* Auto-approving submissions that are ""probably fine"" - e.g. if a user has a decent account age and at least a small amount of karma, a self-post they're making is very likely legitimate, so can be auto-approved if filtered.
* Approve *everything* - e.g. subreddits that are low-traffic that really don't worry about spam, or ones that want to let the voting system decide on every submission
* Removing reported comments containing certain text - e.g. there's an ongoing issue in the default subreddits with a persistent troll that spams ""shock"" images in replies to the top comments of the top submissions. AutoModerator now removes those immediately when they're reported in /r/gaming.

And so on, there are a huge number of possibilities from combining the conditions. Even with just very basic, obvious conditions, a large chunk of the moderating work of a subreddit can be handled. Since implementing it in /r/gaming, the amount of human moderation needed has dropped drastically. In less than 4 days in /r/Music, it's let 238 submissions through the spam-filter, which previously would have had to be done manually.

**Resistance to use and future plans**

One thing I'm finding interesting so far is that when I've offered use of AutoModerator to various subreddits, there's a lot of resistance to using it. A lot of people just don't trust a bot moderating their subreddit, *even though one already does* in the form of the current automatic filter. This one is basically a ""second layer"" of filter, but where you can actually define conditions instead of just giving vague hints and hoping it works. Its decisions can always be overridden, just like the existing filter, but with no side-effects.

I think one factor of this is a feeling of a lack of control - currently the way to modify conditions for your subreddit is ""message Deimorz"", so I think I'd like to set up a web interface where the bot's conditions can be viewed and modified, as well as showing a log of what actions it took and which condition caused them. I also want to make its source code public, so that people are able to run their own instances if they don't want to trust me, or just confirm what exactly it does.

I also have a few more functions that I'm hoping to add very soon, such as being able to apply conditions based on the *youtube* username/description/title as well as the reddit ones, having the bot respond to mod-mail when it approves something (seriously, ~80% of the ""please unfilter my post"" mod-mail now has already been approved by the bot before one of us gets to it, would be nice to know it did it), and having the bot send a mod-mail to a subreddit if any posts get above a ""probably actually a problem"" threshold for reports. *(edit: [all of these functions have been implemented](https://github.com/Deimos/AutoModerator/wiki/))*

Anyway, I thought that ToR would probably be interested in discussing the capabilities and implications of such a bot, and might also have some suggestions for other things it could do. And as well, if any of you are interested in using it for your subreddit(s), definitely let me know, it can be set up in a new subreddit in minutes.",,False,,t5_2rtff,True,,,True,t3_onl2u,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/onl2u/automoderator_a_bot_for_automating/,

I've also had a post that earned about 600 karma in /r/wallpapers. I'll link to them below, but what interests me is that I posted both of them to imgur using my imgur account, so I can see how many views each image got. It seems likely that a post that earns more karma would have more views, at least that's what I've always kinda assumed. But my experience has shown that not to be necessarily true. I would add that it seems especially plausible considering they're both images.

Now, to compare the posts. First let's consider my post to /r/wallpapers: http://np.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/17qsot/pastel_fireworks/

Things worth noting: First, wallpapers has ~200,000 subscribers. Second, the image has a pretty major flaw; zoom in on that and you'll see hot air balloons. I fixed it later, but not for a few months. Third, it got ~40,000 views in the first 3-4 days. It has a few more now, but still about that many: http://i.imgur.com/nSK72X0.png

Let's compare that to my more recent /r/quotesporn image: http://np.reddit.com/r/QuotesPorn/comments/1hqaqa/our_generation_chuck_palahniuk_2560x1440oc/

Things worth noting: quotesporn has ~140,000 subscribers. Second, the image references a pretty popular author, book, and movie on reddit. Third, it has 9,000 views: http://i.imgur.com/vSEAnK9.png

What gives? 

I can think of think of three possible reasons for the disparity in karma/clicks, but first let's do the math 42,000/665=61.16 views per upvote, but of course there are downvotes to consider too, so 42000/879 total votes = 47.78 views/vote. Compare that to 9000/~1000=~9 views/votes or 9000/~1800= 5 views/vote. (I used approxomations on that one becasue it's so recent, but I actually would get a lower view/vote ratio if I used the numbers I saw). So, we have between 7-9 times difference in the ratio on these two posts. 

I have a control to quickly consider before I finish I'll offer my explanation. This post http://np.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/1f01k1/the_kids_are_alright/ garnered 49 total votes and ~9000 views so 9000/49=183; wildly different, but way higher. I can do the same test a number of other posts if anyone is interested. Unfortunately, I don't have any posts I made solely to quotesporn, but I intend on doing another test, well really just obsessively checking numbers on things I post, but still, I expect I'll have more data relatively soon.

How do I explain this disparity:

1. I sometimes feel like imgur might have changed the way they calculates views or imgur may just be poor at recording them; after all, they did have to remove the sort by views feature.

2. The quote I posted, as I noted, had a certain vote-without-viewing factor that the wallpapers lacked. So, I may have just been me stumbling into an accidental karmawhore niche. 

3. /r/wallpapers is crawled by outside sites in a way /r/QuotesPorn isn't. I know of redditlurker and I'm pretty sure I've run into a couple other sites that post links to my wallpapers from reddit. I assume this is the biggest factor, but it's hard to say. 

I'm interested if anyone can think of any other explanation for this disparity, or possibly confirm the imgur hypothesis.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_1i29s8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1i29s8/the_difference_in_click_to_karma_ratio_between/,

Recent events in /r\/atheism serve as a reminder of how difficult it can be to use Reddit's native systems to moderate in accordance with the will of community standard. Put briefly, [subreddits make better proto-feudalisms than they do democracies](http://redd.it/sllnz). The reasons are so entrenched that many users seem to have some difficulty understanding why that's so, but it can be boiled down to several features basic to the site as it currently stands:

1. **Pseudo-anonymity**—Reliable votes are linked to stable, verifiable identities. That's what prevents voter fraud, like individuals voting multiple times under different names. Because Reddit accounts are not linked to stable identities, there's no reliable way to ensure the necessary ideal of ""one person, one vote."" Admins could, in principle, tie votes back to IP addresses, but even that method could be circumvented (using TOR, for example), and is, anyway, currently beyond the scope of mod powers.
2. **Lack of an agreed-upon criteria for eligibility**—In short, whose votes ought to count? In geopolitical votes, this is settled by citizenship, which is normally tied to geography. If you've lived in an area long enough, you have the right to vote. If you don't live in a particular area, you can't vote there. That standard doesn't entirely work on Reddit because there is no real analogue to citizenship when it comes to individual subs. Should only subscribers be allowed to vote? What about users that aren't subscribed, but routinely submit to, vote in, and read a sub as much as, if not more than, many of its subscribers? What about former subscribers who unsubbed because there was no prior recourse for the very issue currently under review?
3. **Methodological issues**—Put simply, the up/down vote system is inadequate to the needs of a policy vote or moderator election. It doesn't allow election officials to ensure that votes correspond to eligible voters, and [vote fuzzing](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/eaqnf/pardon_me_but_5000_downvotes_wtf_is_worldnews_for/c16omup) obscures vote totals, which could be used to determine whether or not a vote was likely to be representative of the entire community. Attempts to implement other methods of vote collection have likewise proven problematic.
4. **Self-selection bias**—Controversial policy changes will tend to draw out the opposition in greater numbers than supporters, regardless of the actual proportion between the two.

Some have suggested random sampling as a method for reliable polling, and that has at least the advantage of being methodologically sound, but in a scenario where the opposition already distrusts the moderation team, it's unlikely that a PM poll will win acceptance unless handled by a mutually trusted independent auditor.

----

## The ""Feetback"" Method

In thinking about these things, I've developed a potential method for settling moderation controversies in extreme cases, like the one currently afflicting /r\/atheism. Because it functions on the principle of ""voting with your feet""—that is, signaling disapproval by abandoning a venue—I'm calling it the ""feetback"" method. Also, the word amuses me. The idea is to structure the moderation team's response to controversy by converting the community's response into a trackable metric.

Before I explain, **a few important caveats**:

1. *The method is not meant to work as the first recourse for policy changes.* Rather, it is meant to be employed only as a way of settling controversy over policy changes that meet with a vocal and active opposition. It is, in effect, disaster management.
2. *The method is not meant to be genuinely democratic.* That is to say, it does not identify a legitimate constituency and let that constituency decide the issue by majority rule. Rather, it is meant to decide issues by tracking one metric for judging health of a subreddit before and after a policy change.
3. *Risk is an innate part of the method.* What are the risks? I'll get to that in the next paragraph. Why would anyone want to incur those risks? See caveat #1.

With that out of the way, let's get to the method itself. The basic premise is this: **The policy change is to be allowed for a trial period, and the mods promise to step down if, at the end of a month and according to a specific and measurable criteria, the policy has significantly damaged the health of the subreddit.** That can be gauged using the following steps:

1. *Decide on a criteria.* This will likely vary depending on the circumstances, and it may be the no one criteria will fit every situation. For most scenarios, though, the criteria I'd suggest is a combination of *average pageviews by week* and *average uniques by week*. In other words, if either stat falls below 66% of the pre-policy-change average, or both below 75%, the policy is a failure and the mods agree to hand the sub over to new mods. The initial average needs to be calculated in advance—if there are no older records of weekly averages, this can be done by calculating weekly averages from the available monthly totals.
2.*Appoint an independent auditor.* This should be someone who is reasonably trusted by both sides of the debate. It can even be a bot, for that matter, so long as efforts are made to minimize the possibility of gerrymandering. The auditor's purpose is to verify the change in stats both at the beginning and end of the trial period. To that end, they must be made a moderator (with limited mod powers, of course) and given the ability to view the traffic stats.
4. *Let the trial run its course.* Set a date for one month from the announcement of the trial. Run the subreddit according to the new policies. At the end of the trial period, tally up the change in the selected criteria and post the results (including screenshots of the relevant traffic stats). The sample period should be *the most recent complete week*, rather than the average of preceding weeks, since the initial opposition of earlier weeks may skew the results. Let the auditor verify the results. If the trial has failed, abide by the agreement to hand the sub over to new mods.

If handled correctly, those steps should limit the amount of damage that any policy change can do to the health of a sub, while simultaneously allowing the community to move beyond non-constructive controversies.

---

## But what's to stop the opposition from interfering with the trial?

For example, [parts of the opposition in the /r\/atheism controversy are attempting to essentially blockade that sub's new queue](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1fywvm/remember_guys_theyre_counting_on_us_to_just_go/). That interferes with any objective attempt to assess either the success or popularity of the new policy.

The feetback method discourages that kind of disruptive strategy by the judicious selection of a criteria for determining the health of the affected sub. In other words, dissenters who attempt to flood a sub or interrupt its normal activity will only add to its weekly pageview count, while ensuring that those users continue to be counted as part of its weekly uniques. A concerted opposition that wants to give the new policy the opportunity to fail will have to do so by *declining* to participate at an elevated rate.

Which isn't to say that the method is meant to, or even necessarily will, force users out of the sub during the trial period. Users who initially oppose the policy change should feel free to continue participating if they find content that interests them (and that content can continue to bubble up on the home pages of subscribed users). The goal is simply to stop abuses of the queue long enough to allow for an untampered assessment of the health of the sub in the context of the new policy.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_1g1que,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1g1que/how_to_address_controversial_moderation_changes/,

If you haven't noticed, they are:

* the Vote Fader in the sidebar;

* the list of links to reddits that are more useful for certain kinds of links, also in the sidebar;

* and the text below the title field on the submit page.

But while I'm at it, I figure I should also make the general gist of all of those changes clear.

Put simply, there are things that ToR can do, and things that we can't do. Moreover, it strikes me that ToR will be more useful and interesting to everyone involved if we make an effort to concentrate on the things that we *can* do.

So what can most of us do? Realistically, I'd narrow it down to two things.

1. We can talk about the impact (or likely impact) of things that we observe on Reddit, whether it's how the site functions or redditing and moderating strategies that we see elsewhere on the site; and

2. We can talk about what we, *as moderators and users*, can do to improve the site;

That isn't to say that the other topics that get raised here aren't potentially valuable, but they're usually more valuable somewhere else.

One of the most popular of those types are posts that talk about changes to the way that Reddit itself works. The vast majority of the readers that have passed through ToR have no way of implementing those changes. We can't censor certain types of behavior, we can't change the way karma works, we can't fix features that aren't working properly. Even the little that we can do along those lines are more likely to be addressed if you post them to a community like /r/bugs.

Yes, a handful of the admins occasionally drop in and comment here, but there's no guarantee that they'll see your suggestion. If you want it to get seen by someone who can actually do something about it, you're better served by posting it to /r/ideasfortheadmins. I hang out there, too, and I can promise you that ideas *do* get discussed there as well.

That said, a lot of what gets misposted here can still be appropriate for ToR with some slight changes to how they're presented. Instead of suggesting that we should change how karma works, ask how Reddit would be different if karma worked differently. Instead of pointing out a strategy and suggesting that it be disallowed, talk about how it effects the site and what ordinary mods and users can do in response.

I don't want to give the impression that a lot of the topics coming through here are innately wrong for ToR. They just need to be directed more toward our strengths. Otherwise, all they do is show up our weaknesses. Over time, that contributes to the attitude that Reddit is simply broken and that we have no recourse.

Of course you do, it's still on the frontpage! Anyhow, I've finally gotten to looking at the data (real life started happening a lot, it was an inconvenience for all). So, here are my ultra-amateur statistics at work!

If you'd like to see the raw results, they can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmhCFwu7UwVydEZRTzQzRXQ3UjFETVBBZEM3d1dfOHc).
***
In total, there were 557 responses. 28 responded ""No"" and 4 responded ""I'm Not Sure"" to ""Do you subscribe to /r/TheoryOfReddit?"". Those responses will be disregarded for the purpose of this survey, leaving us with 525 responses total (anyone interested in seeing the negative responses to this question can view them [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmhCFwu7UwVydHQxbHd4N2xtcC1leDVnUTFpWV9hTGc)). 454 (86%) were male, 62 (12%) were female, and 9 (2%) were unsure or ""Other"".

At the time the survey was closed, there were 18,897 readers of /r/TheoryOfReddit. That means that about 2.87% of the total official subscribers responded to the survey. By my best estimate, somewhere around 50% of the total voting population and a significantly higher chunk of the total commenting population responded, although those figures are mere speculation and are subject to debate.
***
Of the 525 subscribers who responded, 390 (74%) reported they use reddit multiple times a day. 102 (19%) reported using it daily. Only 4 subscribers indicated they use reddit less than ""Once Every Few Days."" The majority of subscribers responded that they use reddit between 1 and 4 hours a day, with 173 (33%) responding with 1-2 hours a day, and 185 (35%) responding with 2-4 hours a day. Approximately 1/3 of subscribers (176 respondants) report operating more than one reddit account. Based on this data, we can conclude that /r/TheoryOfReddit is comprised of dedicated users (a hardly groundbreaking assumption; I would bet most of us are here *because* we are dedicated redditors).

Only 57 (11%) of respondants reported moderating at least one ""Large"" subreddit (more than 500 subscribers). Although it is not certain from these results how many moderators in general there are, it seems to suggest that the subreddit is drawing more regular users than moderators. If this were the case (which it may very well not be), it is interesting to see so many threads on moderation which are heavily discussed.

Concerning academic studies:

338 subscribers reported currently being students; the remaining 187 subscribers are either no longer students or are students who work full-time. Of the students, 100 are in high school, 20 are working towards a two-year degree, 175 towards a four-year degree, 29 towards a master's degree, and 14 towards their doctorate (note: this is not entirely accurate on an international level, considering many countries differ from the United States in this regard).

144 subscribers (27%) reported having no major, because they have yet to attend college or have no plans to. The remaining 381 subscribers reported a wide array of college majors, the results of which are pretty similar to the average redditor profile. The most popular single response was Computer Science, garnering 75 (14%) of the total responses. 44 (8%) responded with some sort of engineering. Another 44 responded as majoring in some science (physics, chemistry, biology, earth sciences, etc.). 102 (19%) of subscribers reported some kind of social science (economics, history, anthropology, psychology, etc. [also note that this consists of many fields, none of which receiving much more than 20 responses each]). 19 responded with as majoring in a ""fine art"" (music, theater, art, etc.) and 16 in a communication art (communications, mass communications, journalism). Beyond that, 16 studied math, 17 business, 10 IT, 10 philosophy, 9 are studying medicine or are in medical school, and the remaining 19 studied another field, or are undeclared (no offence to the folks in those fields, but most of them had so few responses that it would be silly and time-consuming to list every one out).

The ""Levels of Interest"" questions can be easily examined from [this nifty series of charts provided by google](http://i.imgur.com/yASBv.png). In brief: most of the subject areas mentioned in the survey had a simple majority indicating ""Interested"" or ""Highly Interested"". The more heavily-skewed towards the positive side included Computer Science/Information Technology, History, General Sciences, Psychology, Music, Philosophy, and Logic. The more negatively-skewed topics included Art, Archaeology, Communications/Mass Communications, Foreign Language, and Preforming Arts. 20% of subscribers are ""Highly Uninterested"" in Wumbology and presumably hate Spongebob, while 43% are Neutral/Unsure and probably didn't get the joke.

Finally, the most questionable bit, the ""Favorite Subreddit"". The most popular response was /r/AskReddit with 37 responses. I really wanted to go further into depth with this statistic, but as I said earlier, real life caught up with me, and trying to analyze that data turned into a bigger task than I had time for (and the main reason this post was delayed so long). However, one thing I took note of was the number of responses that indicated an alternative to a default subreddit (e.g. /r/games as opposed to /r/gaming, /r/photography as opposed to /r/pics).
***
Anyhow, that's my survey. Thanks to everyone for participating and waiting so patiently for the results. Any qualms with my statistics may be taken up with me here in the thread, although I should warn you ahead of time, if you call me out on something, I'll cave instantly :D

EDIT: As an aside, one of the things that came up in the first thread was a lack of depth (i.e. not enough information was gathered).

1. Do users have expectation of privacy in mod mail?

2. Do moderators have expectation of privacy in mod mail?

3. What are the exceptions to this?

My argument follows, but the goal of this post is to have a good discussion regardless of whether you agree with it.

(1) Users should expect that their mod mail messages will *always* be kept private, unless they choose to release them themselves.

The main reason is similar to why reporting is anonymous. To protect whistleblowers and complaints about other users. People will be more willing to reveal information to the moderators if they trusted that it would be kept private. There are also other obvious cases, such as exchange of any kind of personal information (e.g., AMA verification), informing the mods about serious violations (to make their report more meaningful), and others.

Now, why would we want to extend unconditional protection rather than judge on a case-by-case basis, and why should it be applied to all subreddits? The answer is consistency and simplicity. It's easier for the mods to apply the same *objective* standard to all messages, and it's easier for the users to assume the same standards in all subreddits.

(2) Moderators should assume that whatever they say in mod mail is public, and either the user or other mods can release it without asking. All messages from mods in mail are sent officially with a green [M], and whenever you speak officially, you no longer have any expectation of privacy.

(3) Releasing information to the admins is not considered to be an exception, since they can implicitly view everything. One interesting case is what to do with banning users who are abusive in mod mail and how to justify these bans to the rest of subscribers. My proposal: mods should ask the banned user for their consent to release information; if the user refuses to give consent or release conversations himself, the mods should be trusted that what they say is correct and their decision should not be questioned.

To summarize my position. Users should have absolute expectation of privacy in modmail with no exceptions, while mods reply officially, and are therefore speaking publicly with no exceptions either.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_wdxp8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/wdxp8/expectation_of_privacy_in_moderator_mail/,

Edit for specificity.

I've watch tir before the fall, and still watch as1986, in threads that have barely any attention yet (not near front page low hundreds or under 100 votes) they will have as many or a few more upvotes than anyone, but often more than 10 downvotes when no one in the thread has received any or just o.e or two.

Trapped in reddit had a terrible up/down ratio before he was downbliterated. I saw many posts by him sour have 300 up, but also 150 down, etc as1986 is similar.

I personally have seen people reference that I have 10s or even 100 downvotes from them, and I tend to have much better ""ratios"" than either of those two.

It seems like just becoming ""prominent"" results in attracting large groups of auto-downvoters.

I'm just curious what motivates people to do this in particular. 

Edit 2: another issue that affects this seems to be 1) posting frequency 2) amount of karma.

What is the perception of Redditors who post lots and lots? It seems most of negative feelings are from two things, that the person posts a lot, with the commentary saying to reduce frequency, and secondly there is a strong negative reaction towards users who are viewed as ""just in it for the karma.""

The Vote Fader is essentially a ""heat map"" that moderators can put in their sidebar in order to encourage their readers to vote in line with the intent of their reddits. It organizes types of submissions from those that readers should be most inclined to vote up, to those that they should be most inclined to vote down. The Vote Fader is particularly useful for specialty reddits that attempt to distinguish themselves from the defaults by focusing on specific kinds of submission or discussion.

For an example of the Vote Fader in use, see the sidebar in /r/StateOfTheUnion. Earlier versions were covered in the [first post](http://redd.it/my0qo) on the Fader, and after the [update to v3](http://redd.it/ncyl6).

## Changes in the version

The major change is that the Fader is now rendered using a table rather than a list. That allowed me to put in some Unicode arrows in the margins at either side, which should, at least in theory, make the function of the Fader more intuitive for the uninitiated.

I've also adjusted the color gradient to be a more exact match with the colors Reddit uses for the up and down vote arrows, and provided a nice little icon that links back to this page. Users who have custom styles disabled will now see a message explaining that they need CSS enabled to see the Fader in all its glory.

## How do I implement it?

First of all, copy the following text to your stylesheet:

    /* Vote Fader, v.4.1 */
    .titlebox blockquote {
        border-left: none;
        margin: 0px;
        overflow: hidden;
        padding: 1px;
     }
    .titlebox blockquote table {

        background-image:         linear-gradient(#FF8B60, white, #9494FF);
        margin: 0px;
        width: 298px;
        overflow: hidden;

    }
    .titlebox blockquote table tbody {

        width: 298px;
        text-align: center;
    }
    .titlebox blockquote table td {
        border: none;
        white-space: nowrap;
    }
    .titlebox blockquote table td a[href=""//vote""] {
        color: white;
        cursor: default;
        font-size: 2.25em !important;
        line-height: 0px;
        margin: 0px;
        padding: 0px;
    }
    .titlebox blockquote table th a[href=""//http://redd.it/r5clp""] {
        color: black !important;
        font-size: xx-small !important;
    }
    .titlebox blockquote table tr:first-child {
        line-height: .5em;
        visibility: hidden;
    }
    .titlebox blockquote table tr:nth-last-child(1) {

    .titlebox blockquote table thead {

        line-height: 1em !important;
        text-align: center;
        visibility: visible;
    }

Then copy the following text to your sidebar, substituting in the types of posts you want your Fader to address in the place of the ""content"" text:

*Welcome to our weekly ""Admin-Level Change"" thought experiment. Each week, an individual /r/TheoryOfReddit moderator will host a discussion about a theoretical changes to reddit's code, infrastructure or official policy that would not be possible for users and moderators to accomplish alone; it would require admin intervention.*

Here is this week's topic:

## How could reddit improve the selection of which posts to show users first?

**Discussion**  
  
The public face of reddit is the mixed reddit.com frontpage, where 25 links (by default) are picked from the default set or a user's chosen subreddits. How could the quality of this small set, and its relevance to the user's personal interests, be improved? A few ideas to start us off :

*  *Weighting by domain / file type.*  
  
In subreddits with mixed content of discussions and links, a common complaint is that ""quick"" content that takes very little effort to look at and react to, crowds out ""slow"" content that takes longer to read and think about.  
  
One idea is that all votes do not have to be equal. A mod-team could set a weighting system based on the linked address and/or by the linked file-type. For example, they might want a vote for a .gif on a meme site to count as 0.7 votes, and for a long self-post with links to a whitelist of reference sites to count as 1.3 votes.  
  
The rule-set for vote weighting should probably be made public for every subreddit. Circumventing the system by using forwarding URLs is already covered by existing common rules against using link-shortening services. 

*  *Ranking normalised for time of day.*  
  
The first hour of a post's life on reddit is crucial to breaking into /hot. Posts posted at a quiet time of day can vanish without trace, buried under the rush when America wakes up. A common question in the history of /r/theoryofreddit has been ""what's the best time of day to post?"" [Redditlater.com](http://redditlater.com) has sprung up as a service for insomniacs and those in less redditor-heavy time zones to schedule their posts for a time when it stands a better chance of being seen by a wide audience. This can make the front page a little stale for people not in the most popular time zones, and too fast to keep up with at rush times. 
  
This could be mitigated by referencing the number of users active at the time of the post, and weighting votes appropriately. For example, if a post gets 20 votes when 300 users are online, it will climb higher than a post that gets 50 votes when 3000 users are online.

*  *Crowdsourced post / subreddit discovery.*

[Last.fm](http://last.fm) works on a very effective system of recommending music based on what other users with similar listening habits also like. Reddit could further personalise the front page, and improve post and subreddit discovery, by adopting a similar system. For example, if I always upvote posts from a certain set of blogs, it's likely that there are other fans on reddit behaving similarly. With the new social discovery system, reddit would place greater weighting on their votes when building my personal front page, and even suggest posts they like from subreddits I'm not subscribed to.  

This would have to be an opt-in system to avoid privacy concerns, and have a quick and streamlined UI to bypass bad recommendations and teach the system how well it's working - again a little like last.fm's love/skip/ban options.

Please let us know what you feel works and doesn't work with the current ranking system.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_1j0z2r,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1j0z2r/admin_level_change_thought_experiment_week_04/,moderator

-------------------------------------------

Longwinded bullshit:

Reddit is one of the biggest single organs of discussion and deliberation on the web. It is also completely moderated by volunteers. Are some skilled ones doing all the work? Do moderators looking to recruit new moderators draw from people they've already worked with, or from their subscribers? What large networks of subreddits with the same moderators are there? I looked at a network of reddit moderators and the subreddits they moderate and failed to answer most of these questions.

###Data:

By asking reddit.com admin Deimorz nicely, I obtained a CSV (Comma Separated Values) formatted list of moderators and the subreddits they moderate. (See Appendix 3 for example subset of the raw data.) I'm not sure how old this data is, but it has /r/unlimitedbreadsticks so I'm thinking fairly recent. There are 38378 moderators, 20761 subreddits, for a total of 59139 nodes and 653541 edges. It's not the entire data set: when I crawled for subscribers I got like 300000 subreddits, but Deimorz has said it's probably from stattit, so it's only subreddits that were once in the top 5000. Also it's like three months old.

###Procedure:

 1. I cleaned the data set (moderators.csv), added /u/ in front of users and /r/ in front of subreddits so that subreddits with the same name as users (e.g. /r/agentlame) wouldn't mess with the bipartiteness of the graph, and separated it into a file for edges and a file for nodes, so that I could add an attribute (bipartite) to the nodes, which makes it easier to make projections in NetworkX.

 2. Opened a new gephi project file. Went to ""Data Laboratory"" and used ""Import Spreadsheet"" to import the nodes first, making sure ""force nodes to be created as new ones"" was unchecked. Then imported the edges. Saved the result as moderators.gefx making our hub-and-spokey affiliation network.

 3. I wanted to split this into two projections, one that would connect moderators together based on how many subreddits they moderate in common, and another that would connect subreddits together based on common moderators.  I wrote a python script to do this which makes use of the NetworkX library, ""networkxprojection.py"". (I originally planned to use the Gephi multimodal networks plugin, but it was very memory-inefficient and this network is big.) My script spits out two unweighted networks and two weighted ones in gml format, I basically just used the weighted ones. The weights are simple and not normalized. It also spits out some average degree measurements for each class, which are hard to do in gephi.

 4. Now that I had these projected gmls, I loaded them into gephi again and poked at them. For each GML, the original and the two projections: I ran modularity with resolution 1.0, then partitioned by modularity class, layout by ForceAtlas2, calculated average path length (takes forever), sized nodes by # subscribers, and checked out the huge connected component, etc.


###Results:

##Original graph:

[Both in the same graph](http://tz18.github.io/interlockingmoderatorship/displayboth/index.html)

The original moderator and subreddits graph shows a large connected component and a belt of disconnected small cliques. The average degree displayed in Gephi is misleading, because it doesn't distinguish between moderators and subreddits, and I could not find how to get the average degree of each class of node in Gephi. So I used networkX for this. There are about three big modules: circlejerk/braveryjerk, SFWporn, and celebrity worship. The fempire and other networks are also visible.

| Metric | Result (w/ Automod) | Result (w/o automod)|
|:-------|:------------------------|:-------------------------|
|Size of giant connected component | 50.56% of nodes |49.63% of nodes (549 fewer nodes)
|Largest detected module | 4.51% of nodes | 4.04% of nodes 
|Average shortest path | 8.994 | 9.747 
|Network diameter |33| 33
|Avg. subreddits moderated per moderator |These were incorrect |1.642
|Avg. moderators per subreddit |So I removed them |3.035
|Modularity |0.928 |0.933

##Moderators:

[Moderators mapped by shared subreddits network.](http://tz18.github.io/interlockingmoderatorship/displaymods/index.html) 

The modules are clearer in the projection of moderators that share subreddits. There are again many big cliques that kind of stand out, but are mostly just the ""anyone who posts is made a moderator"" subs. The /r/gratefuldead mods stand out for having a lot of mods of which only a few mod anything else in general reddit. But mostly we see a large spread-out community of mods of mainstream, popular subreddits, and a somewhat separate community made up of mods of subreddits which satirize reddit, e.g. /r/circlejerk, /r/braveryjerk, etc. There are a number of very high degree hubs in this network. Some are special users such as AutoModerator, a moderator python bot which performs menial tasks and which anyone can add to their subreddit and be benefited by, and which may have confounded community finding. Others appear to be simply very active users.


|Metric | Result (w/ Automod) |Result (w/o Automod)|
|:------|:--------------------------|:---------------------|
|Size of giant connected component| 51.88% of nodes| 50.75% of nodes
|Largest detected module |9.25% of nodes| 8.38% of nodes
|Average shortest path |4.72 |5.104
|Network diameter |16 |16
|Avg. unweighted degree |9.956 |9.854
|Avg. weighted degree |12.302 |12.157
|Modularity| 0.841| 0.847
|Average Clustering Coefficient| 0.895| 0.894



##Subreddits:

[Subreddits mapped by shared moderators network.](http://tz18.github.io/interlockingmoderatorship/displaysubs/index.html) 

Visualization of the graph of subreddits shows five clear modules of subreddits: satire of reddit, pornography, celebrity worship, SFWporn (high resolution pictures of cars and rocks and stuff). Then there is a big clump of random relatively normal, unrelated stuff, which I'm going to guess is connected by AutoModerator and thus perhaps should be ignored..

|Metric|Result (w/ automod)|Result (w/o automod)|
|:------|:----------------------|:-----------------------|
|Size of giant connected component|48.45%|47.56%
|Largest detected module|10.94%|12.59%
|Average shortest path|4.058|4.416
|Network diameter|16|16
|Avg. unweighted degree|35.094|22.288
|Avg. weighted degree|47.008|34.008
|Modularity|0.676|0.698
|Average Clustering Coefficient|0.766|0.753

###Conclusion:

I think that my analysis did provide new insights. Community analysis of subreddits found that there are at least four general categories of subject matter have prompted the creation of many specific subreddits moderated by the same people: celebrity worship, SFWPorn, satire of reddit, and pornography. Looking at the projected graph of moderators, we found that there are in fact many high-degree hub users. And our layout of the graph of moderators and partition by modularity-determined community showed that there are two large communities of moderators: mainstream redditors, and those that make fun of them.

Qualitatively analyzing the various states of minds that make up the frontpage hivemind.,GuntripAnalysis,96,36,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1bppc4/is_there_a_way_to_compare_word_usage_between/,"I do not know how to code but im ok with statistics and spss so perhaps acquiring this data is possible? Hang with me for a sec. 

This is for all of the default subreddits. And this example here just utilizes some of the simpler variables I could think of. 

A magical robot inside the internet grabs all the posts amongst all these subreddits and searches for word X. It then pumps out some data. 

Some simple examples:

First proportion would be a comparing (total number of times when X was said) with (total number of times a word was said 
[all words]) in the subreddits with one another.  Adjustments would be made based on total number of users. That gives us some information.

Another proportion would be comparing (how often a user said X) with (how many users are subscribed [and/ or active users) in the subs with one another. That could give us some more information. 

There needs to be a lot, *a whole lot more* data to get a fuller picture of the hivemind, and even then I don't think you will truly understand it. This is an objective way of obtaining data and trying to qualitatively analyze it. Not obtain a complete understanding. 


Here are variables I am interested in playing around with:

* Average number of words per day on subreddit
* Average number of posts per day
* Average number of unique posts per day
**** How often these subreddits posted in? (can scale this one baby)
****Total number of subscribers (scaled)

And a bunch more. 

I think this would be a possible way to see into the hivemind. 

Could a magical robot/bot be developed to obtain these variables? If so I can punch some statistics into it and a whole bunch of interesting numbers would come out of it which we could try and interpret.  

I hope this makes sense so please ask if you have any questions about what I am interested in. I'm thinking Worf hypothesis (or linguistic relativity, whichever is the PC term) in this concoction about the hivemind here.

The reaction form the subreddit has generally been negative; it's one thing to summarize a subreddit explicitly, but this seems like a deliberate attempt to copy without citation. People have suggested upvoting random irrelevant pictures/links or even very NSFW content, so that the bot can be reported to Twitter. So far, though, I haven't seen a whole lot of either.

How were they detected? Are there other Twitter feeds of any subreddit that are more accepted by it?

Even on top of this, asking questions about a bot that reposts things from a forum is sort of difficult; if it is taken down, how do you prevent it from happening again?

What does this mean to you, theorizer? Well that's up to the individual! To me it means that the negative flair isn't necessarily a death knell for a unpolished post, if the material is there, it can definitely thrive. Typically posts with it aren't going to do well though.

Contrast this with the quality post flair we use and the ten most recent posts that have earned it (again ordered by net upvotes)-

Man that sure is a lot of posts that have more then 100 net upvotes! In fact, even the ones that didn't bust that arbitrary number still has a fantastic upvote ratio. The question to be asked though is simple: Was it the quality post flair that earned those upvotes or was it just the posts themselves being quality? As is readily apparent on [our front page](/r/circlebroke), posts are getting 100+ upvotes without the flair, so it seems to me that the flair isn't making a post thrive where it would otherwise fail, just bringing it a bit more attention.

With all that in mind, what are your thoughts on using a high/low quality post flair? Do you think it's a glorified super up/downvote that has no real effect on a submission? Do you feel it can be used to chilling effect? Do you think it can be a viable tool for a mod to help steer discussion on their subreddit[?](/r/TheoryOfReddit ""I hope everyone likes my subtle joke."")",Low Effort,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_10xfg2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/10xfg2/high_and_low_quality_post_flair_a_short/,

I know an action many users have taken is simply unsubscribing to these areas. But one day I saw a comment where someone made an entirely new account so they can have a default-free set up; a way of browsing Reddit without a barrage of memes and screen shots. So I decided to give it a try.

Here we are. This is my second of two accounts, which I use for links and discussion only. I purposely unsubscribed from all the major subreddits and went on a hunt to find some of the gems hidden beneath the crust. With RES, it is ultra easy to flip between the two accounts.

To give you an idea of the variance between the two accounts, this account's front page has a single image in the top 25 links, which is a propaganda poster. I don't mind seeing propaganda posters hitting my front page because they are usually interesting. But when I take a look at my 'default' account, I can see 15 images that are memes/screen shots and that count is on the lower end of the range. There have been plenty of times where I've seen 20+ of the 25 links as images.

I've really enjoyed the ability to still view a lot of pics/screen shots/memes in small doses and being able to flip back to this account for more discussion-oriented material. I suggest giving it a try.

Edit:

 **Why not browse r/all?** A reply from below:

&gt;I don't browse r/all because there are still plenty of subreddits I have no desire to see even when I'm lowering the quality of my experience. For instance, I don't want to see minecraft pics, skyrim jokes or anything from r/atheism. My default experience is molded to what I want to see and still greatly differs from /r/all.

**Why not use RES Dashboard/multiple reddit formatting?**

If I configure RES to hide subreddits from [/r/all](/r/all) so I can avoid the clutter, I'm left with no way of quickly recreating these settings if I use another computer. The same goes for the multi-reddit formatting. Bookmarks won't necessarily transfer from one computer to the other.

If you watch [blog.reddit](http://blog.reddit.com/) you will notice that the latest posts are more in the type of gathering extra users (IAMA of celebrities published, the college subreddit idea, getting attention of a reddit gathering,...) and less about the technical things behind Reddit (you still got those 'Nerd Talks' but less). 

Also, one of the things a lot of people keep coming to the website is karma, people whore themselves out for it by reposting everything as an image but ideas like hiding the karma, stopping karma for links to images (fairly easy to configure because only 4-5 websites can handle Reddit traffic at the moment; you should add imgur.com to your filter in RES and watch how the frontpage of /all/ just loses 95% of the posts) are ignored by all the admins and none of them want to comment on anything that is related to karma. Why not? Are they afraid that when people need to do some effort to gain karma that they will just leave to another website?

When I saw the idea of the college contest I immediately thought about what for cheap form of marketing it is. A lot of people were cheering in arms for this contest but if you just look at the idea, they will receive a lot of new users and in return they will go out and visit a college for a day? Marketing at its best! They have just earned a couple of thousand extra users and got a field trip in exchange for it.

Also, when /r/jailbait was banned I thought about how the admins just banned a very popular but controversial subreddit just because a couple of mods on that subreddit where not in good terms with the admins, isn't that the powerabuse we hate? Why would they ban a subreddit with over 30.000 users (and a lot more lurkers as stats showed once) while the problem was something with the mods. You got abusive mods who take over and censor a subreddit and where the Reddit hivemind requests the admins to take action against them. But here they refuse to take any action because it is the community who ""decides"" everything but in a controversial subreddit where nobody said anything about the mods, the admins take action because of the ""bad behaviour"" of those mods. I have some sort of feeling that they just saw an opportunity to ban a subreddit that was controversial and could harm the image of Reddit and lose advertisers (you don't want your product linked to jailbait).

Another thing is that the admins claim to censor a lot of advertisements like no sound advertisements, no flash advertisements,... but advertisements that are no better than a casino advertisement are allowed ([Win easily $10](http://www.reddit.com/comments/jq6za/play_money_mover_a_social_trivia_game_brought_to/), [Get your adsense account approved...](http://www.reddit.com/comments/jltwx/get_your_adsense_account_approval_must_read_the/),...) and when their is an uproar about an advertisement the admins come out quickly, apologize 
 about how that one advertisement slipped their eyes and advertise another time to disable adblock plus on Reddit.

Did Reddit become more of a ""corporation"" or do I need to be less pessimistic?

Now consider a user who is actively involved in the community, continually adds thoughtful discussion, but also is being paid to promote varying sites, products, or groups. If the user is smart and careful, it is very unlikely that this type of activity would be uncovered. This behaviour would also be indistinguishable from a normal, innocent user. 

If this type of activity were uncovered, people would probably feel angry, betrayed, and cheated. They wouldn't necessarily be angry about the content itself, but rather at the fact that it was delivered in a deceptive manner.

Anyone that knows how caching works knows that more popular content is more easily cached, and less popular content is harder to cache (since each visit likely has more time between it and the last, and more changes between it and the last one)

Therefore, popular subreddits require MUCH less of a load/hit than unpopular subreddits. Therefore, the more sparsely distributed the community and hits are across Reddit, the higher the load will be per hit. This would seem to give the admins reason to want people to stay within the default subreddits and reduce their desire to improve subreddit discovery to a point. 

Two thoughts:

1) Is this possibly one of the reasons why the admins are seem so reluctant to make changes that will assist with subreddit discovery? 

2) Is this possibly why Reddit wants more funding? I feel like their revenue is now growing appropriately OR faster than the number of page visits are. It's a matter of each hit getting cheaper and cheaper as the scale grows larger (the internet is certainly one of the best examples of economies of scale). 

So it doesn't seem to make sense that Reddit needs more funding per hit now than they did before.

I'm not calling it an conspiracy, I'm just thinking that Reddit wants to start implementing some more ""expensive"" features into Reddit now such as stronger subreddit discovery (assuming this is actually an ""expensive"" feature) and this why the call for additional funding has been done. They're partially confirmed this with some promises for additional features, but it seems like they are saying the main reason for more funding is seeing more hits. As well, I'm thinking that subreddit discovery is actually an ""expensive feature"" and is purposefully being avoided to some degree.

Reddit has numerous irreconcilable political factions, many of which treat debate disingenuously-- like a game.  At least, there are enough disingenuous users who maintain a certain lowest common denominator of discussion.  I think this status quo will continue to devolve in many cases.

Here is are some of the steps I would expect in this devolution of dialogue:

1) Straw man opponent arguments overtly

2) Covertly sock-puppet the adversary / Poe's Law.

3) Upvote the opponent's lowest common denominator content (opinions, comments, etc)

4) Also embody the opponent's lowest common denominator user as as if you are a part of their invading down-vote brigade, worsening their reputation in terms of respect for general reddiquette in the eyes of the general community and admins.


I would imagine this behavior is already occurring, and I would expect that it continues to materialize and evolve given the growing number of polarized factions inside reddit.

This will jeopardize reddit's potential as a truth-seeking project, on over all.

**Experiment in comments! It was too long for the subtext.**

-----

So I was going to wait a bit longer before posting this, but I was talking to my friend about it and am chatty cathy tonight. Let's talk about information control and how it can be utilised passively. 

Subreddits are fucking big. If even one tenth of /r/TodayIlearned is active, that's 100.000 people reading the same page *just* counting those logged in. To give you a more accurate idea of the numbers frequenting it, here are the stats from a **single day** (albeit one of the better ones):

&gt;(unique views) 364,350 (impressions) 704,067	 (subscriptions) 4,656

That's tens of thousands of people every hour. Reaching that many people with a message is the dream of every company, organisation, and ideology on the planet, and we use it to post trivia. We're children playing with hydrogen bombs, it's brilliant.

So one of the things I'm really interested in is information control. I'll preface this by saying that I'm not actively censoring anything (on the contrary, I was one of three or four of our mods who stood up for the SOPA blackout and am actively against any form of censorship, up to the point of defending /r/Jailbait), but psyops is the most fascinating part of warfare for me and I love anything to do with propaganda. 

**Actual content time!** I mod a subreddit called /r/fifthworldproblems, and we've something of a unique issue. Because I never explicitly said *what* the fifth world is, there's no way for anyone *but* me to know what to post. We've got close to fifteen thousand subscribers and it's all original content, so that's dancing in a minefield as far as trying to keep any sense of coherency is concerned. 

Directly telling people what they can and cannot post is not something I'm okay with, outside of very basic rules meant to keep Cthulhu and Star Trek out of the front page. Restricting creativity stifles it and no good would come of outright saying ""The fifth world is supposed to be dark. Post more dark shit or I'll kick your pets until they cry.""

To that end, I've spent the last six months or so, from the moment we started getting too popular for our own good (near-daily posts in major subreddits and a front page post in /r/wtf, causing our population to jump from 50 to 5000 in a matter of weeks and causing content stagnation almost instantly), using CSS edits to passively control the flow of information. It's all experimental and none of it is particularly conclusive yet, but what I already have is worth checking out and it carries some big implications both good and bad.

BUT HAPPYBLAJUR, AINT PROPAGANDER BAD? NAZIS HAD IT.

----

It's a dirty word, but propaganda is at its core the act of disseminating  an idea to the wider public. Propaganda on reddit is used to:

- Reinforce or change a subreddit's image. ""Ents"" in /r/trees are an example of this. By rebranding the ""stoner"" image and giving it a positive makeover (happy, friendly tree people), they cultivated a culture which ended up blossoming far more than other stoner subreddits have. Say what you will about the circlejerking, the ents built an empire on this website and they did it through basic propaganda. 

- Mobilise manpower and resources for specific causes. A few months ago, /r/atheism capitalised on the rampant antitheistic sentiment of the subreddit to create a charity competition with /r/christianity supporting Medecins Sans Frontieres. Anyway, it wasn't spun as ""Let's raise money for MSF"", it was ""Let's beat the Christians"". Using an enemy's progress to further your own agenda, basic propaganda. 

- Destroy communities. Consider SRS and the recent ephebophile scandal. In a matter of a few days, they had targeted a larger community, capitalised on their own infamy to raise awareness of it, and then completely lock down rival sentiment by declaring anyone who sided with the ephebophiles as a paedo-sympathiser. Overnight they had raised an issue, neutered the opposition, and pressured Reddit with the same scalpel to deliver the coup de grace while enriching their own position as morality police rather than a moralist circlejerk. Basic, brilliant propaganda. 

- Control the direction of content. Let's say you run /r/politics and you think there's too much conservative content getting through. Removing it silently is bound to be noticed by both the submitters and the other moderators. Outright saying ""This is a liberal subreddit"" will result in your head on a pike after the ensuing shitstorm blows over. Mobilising the leftist base through controlling what they see makes a goldstein of the conservatives and sends them running. I can't think of many good examples of this, but it's exactly what I'm doing so we'll just continue from there. 

With a subreddit as esoteric as fifthworldproblems, and especially with the burden of original content, you can only really expect around 5-10% of the posters to ""get"" what they're supposed to be posting right off the bat. These people will produce the stand-out, quality posts which drive new people to the subreddit. You want these people, you want to maximise that number. 

The bulk of your membership isn't creative, isn't funny, and isn't in tune thematically. They're like hyperactive dogs who see moving cars and want to run after them, even if it means being smashed, just because movement is fun and they like to have fun. These are your parrots, and you can feed them into the former group by seeding them with creative cues to build off of. 

Then there's the shitposter minority, but even they have a role. Every statistic looks better padded and their numbers on the sidebar bring help to bring in your parrots and your creators. Don't cater to them, don't count on them, just use them to fill seats and hope the law of averages works in your favour. 

Propaganda targets the middle group. The creators will continue to post as long as they're recognised for it, the shitposters will fill their seats and occasionally cross-promote you in other subreddits, but it's that tryhard majority which you want to shift into the creator group and in doing so move the direction of the content they're creating (as by nature they're parrots feeding off the cues of the creator group to generate their own content) toward your end goal.

1320923918.0,66,self.TheoryOfReddit,m7b2u,"Advice for Topical or Subject-based subreddits, and changing from ""all"" to ""text-only"" submissions, based on the experience at /r/fitness",menuitem,80,14,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/m7b2u/advice_for_topical_or_subjectbased_subreddits_and/,"I am a mod at /r/fitness. In this post, I give a detailed discussion of how [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) became a text-only subreddit in July 2011.  At the bottom, I describe that the behavior known as ""karma-whoring"" may be directly related to the size of the subreddit subscriber base.  I propose that topic or subject-centered subreddits wishing to avoid ""karma-whoring"" should change from a ""links and text-based"" subreddit to a ""text-only"" subreddit, when they reach a subscriber base of 40K-50K redditors. 

On July 1, 2011, [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) began a one-month trial of text-only posts, changing from the previous default setting of 'all' (links and text), which subsequently was made permanent.  This trial was initiated after  mod-led threads on the direction of the subreddit over the previous half year. 

In January 2011, fittit had something like 20,000 subscribers.  This soon thereafter exploded, quickly reaching 70,000 subscribers in the Feb-March period (these numbers may not be accurate: I'm recalling them from memory, and have no documentation about the precise numbers), with the growth largely flattening out by early April.  The number of unique impressions increased from about 800K in December 2010, to well over 3M in March 2010.  We think this was related to fittit being advertised on the front page by the admins, and perhaps also related to the subreddit being nominated as ""best community"" or somesuch.  Anyhow, the number of readers exploded. 

Prior to, and during most of this explosion, the focus on fittit was fitness-related discussion.  Specifically, fitness is about being in a physical and mental condition to accomplish desired tasks -- sports, or daily work, or even just living life and feeling good about it.  Thus, fitness as discussed on the subreddit usually involves a basic weight-training program (which includes weight programming, proper diet, and rest), can involve discussions of cardio-centered exercises, and then it expands into sports-related applications, day-to-day issues related to all of these. 

Whether subreddits are discussion boards (topic-based discussion) or communities (human-based social interaction) is really just a summative description of how the board actually behaves.  Based on what I've seen on fittit, I believe that when the subreddit it small -- about 20K users and lower -- subreddits operate largely as discussion boards; above this, the proportion of posts which are about human-based social interactions increases, and this is an important point: more and more people come to the board in order to participate in emotional (as opposed to informational) exchanges.   They like to see posts which re-inforce their ideas, entertain them, brighten their day -- and the shorter the post is (low time investment), the more they like it.  

Now, to encourage a community, emotional-based interactions (which is another way to describe ""karma-whoring posts"") can produce a very positive effect on the community, when such interactions make up a small fraction (I will say, &lt;5%) of the group interactions.  If you've ever belonged to a goal-oriented group, it helps to have someone cut-up every now and then, throw a joke out there, relieve tension, make everyone feel human. 

On the other hand, when a large fraction of the group interactions are jokes, it takes away from the reason that everyone else originally joined the group for -- and those 'early members' become distracted, upset, and eventually wander off. 

Thus, imgur posts of topic-related pictures which are exclusively funny begin to increase in their prevalence on the board.  The posting of these is a phenomenon called 'karma-whoring', because of the link-karma it generates for the OP (*here, I stress that the 'karma-whoring' designation, though it may sound contrary, is not intended as a value-laden condemnation. It is merely and only a common description for behavior which is widely known and recognized.*).  

Because of this, on fittit, the proportion of karma-whoring posts gradually increased.  This leads to the following problem: the moderators all started with the board when it was dicussion-based, and that is how they see the board.  However, it slowly became a community-based board, and the daily top posts would be pictures which elicit laughs, and not useful discussion about fitness. 

To many redditors, this is not a problem at all: a subreddit is what its users upvote.  To the moderators, however, this is a huge problem, because none of them are involved for yuks, shits and giggles: they're there for useful discussion.  This creates a conflict between the many redditors who like reddit in its 'default' base (where links and self-posts are permitted) and visit largely for the yuks, and the moderators (and many other users) who suddenly see the content-based board over-run with karma-whoring images. 

To the moderators, this growing behavior was worrisome.  The effect of displacing the discussion-based threads is not terribly major (they were no where near 100% of all threads on the board on any given day).  But the major perceived problem was that they dramatically change the community, by driving out the 'old' members who were discussion-oriented, and bringing in new members who are largely image-yuks oriented. 

This led to discussion, first among the mods, then [in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/iba3u/fittit_what_do_you_think_should_we_try_to_tip_the/) about a proposed solution: change to ""text-only"" submissions.  The discussion was very strongly  supportive of the move. When we [announced the change would take place](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/id6oe/the_rfitness_self_post_only_experiment_begins/), we saw stronger blowback.  However, the arguments against were largely about power (""you have no right!"") and not convincingly substantive (such as ""/r/fitness"" is better with all the pictures!). The test period of one month proceeded. 

After the test period, [a post which evaluated the results both quantitatively and qualitatively was produced by a mod.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/j6mhj/end_results_of_the_self_post_experiment/).  Surprisingly, the mod found only modest changes to the types of posts which were made during the month testing period for ""text-only"" posts (many of these posts contained links to external sites, and some of those fell in the category of ""motivators"", which is basically where ""karma-whoring"" style posts went before).  But the qualitative response of both the mods and the users was very strongly positive.  The users who stayed for the full month liked it. 

I want to stress this point here: quantitatively, the number of 'karma-whoring' images did not substantively change over the month.  However, because such images must be embedded in a text-only post, they gain no karma for their poster, and qualitatively, they were less aimed at raw yuks than actually addressing the fitness topic. As a result, the perception of everyone was that the board was much improved by the change to text-only.  **The complaint that we often heard before was that the switch to 'text-only' was to drive out the karma-whoring images; the switch did not do this, but the perception of those images which were submitted was that they were of much higher quality, much more on topic, and therefore more valuable to the subreddit.**  

Since that time -- and since May 2011 -- the subscriber base has largely grown linearly, at a rate of 200-300 new readers a day.   This does not appear to have been interrupted by changing to ""text-only"" posts in July 2011. Also, the traffic on the subreddit largely plateaued in March, and has been largely constant since then, except for a ~15% dip which hit in September (perhaps due to school re-starting).  Thus, the change to text-only did not significantly decrease either subscriptions or traffic compared to the trends prior to the change. 

**Conclusions**

* A topical or subject-based subreddit of size &lt;20K subscribers is largely focussed on the subject at hand. However, at this size, ""karma-whoring"" type images appear.  These can have a *positive* effect on the community, as
such images remain &lt;5% of the total posts, and are a welcome tiny distraction from the focus at hand. 
* At a subreddit size of approximately 40K-50K subscribers, the link-karma to be gained by an imgur becomes tempting enough that ""karma-whoring"" type images begin to change the tenor and tone of the subreddit.    
* By the time a subreddit reaches 70K subscribers, karma-whoring type images are driving away long-time members who no longer see the subreddit as a valuable resource, as they previously did. 
* In conclusion, it is strongly advisable that topical or subject-based subreddits remain ""text and links"" until they reach a subscriber base of ~50K.  At that size, it is strongly advisable to change the subreddit to ""text-only"" posts, with the goal in mind of maintaining a topical- or subject-based discussion in the subreddit.

Here is this week's topic:

## What if mods had more tools similar to other Internet forums?

**Prelude**

This week the admins introduced some new functionality for moderators to use for managing subreddits: [sticky posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1jr429/moderators_you_can_now_sticky_a_selfpost_to_the/). It was generally positively received among the moderator community as a great new thing to be used within their communities. This is somewhat odd since sticky posts have been around for a very long time on the internet, except on reddit. 

____________

**Discussion**

Reddit was traditionally a website where people could submit links and vote on them, nothing more. Over time subreddits were added as were comments, resulting in the fact that many people now say that a lot of subreddits are basically traditional forums with the main difference being the way how content and comments are sorted; the voting mechanism. Even something like conversation threading [has been around since a very very long time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_threading). 

However there are many things available to ordinary forum moderators that are not available to moderators on reddit. A few examples of things available in modern forum software: 

- Locking posts so people can't comment in them anymore. 
- ~~Make posts sticky~~ Make multiple posts sticky. 
- Truly deleting posts, currently people can still go to a post if they have the link and post comments (see the previous point). 
- Tag users/user notes. 
- Edit titles. 
- Merge posts. 
- Splitting off a topic.
- Filter out posts or comments based on keywords. 
- Set the subreddit to ""approved posts only"".
- Move a post to another subreddit. 
- User permission system, there are some scattered permissions for the wiki and approved submitters but those are very general. 
- Duplicate thread prevention (suggestion of similar threads when a user posts something) 
- A truly central moderation control panel. There are several areas that try to fill in that function to some degrees but many aspects are scattered around the place and take you to fastly different pages. 
- Inline moderation, select a post or comment thread you want to moderate, select a tool to use and click go. 
- Scheduled/delayed moderation, close a post after a certain amount of time. 
- Removal reasons. 
- User warnings, the ability to warn a user from the sub. You can pm a user but some users tend to make things personal. 
- User point system, three strikes and you are out! 
  - View warning logs. 
- Automatic actions against potential troublemakers, if someone receives a large amount of reports he is flagged for review and withhold certain permissions until reviewed. 
- Filter the moderation log on actions taken on a user.

The above list contains items that certainly are possible with third part tools right now (automoderator, modtools, toolbox) but those either require individual mods to install extensions or depend on being hosted somewhere. Mods might see things on their mobile without seeing other things served to them through a extension and a external server hosting a bot might experience downtime or be a bit slow since it has hit the reddit api limit. 
So while some of tools on the above list are available they are not by any means ideal since they are add ons and not integrated in reddit itself.

So what are your thoughts on this? Would these (or other unlisted) features be beneficial for moderators? How should they be implemented and to what degree? How would they affect reddit if they were implemented?

Currently testing to see what subreddits overlap.,PoliticalBot,80,16,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1cr76s/scraped_902364_comments_from_266375_users_in_948/,"You might remember [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/126pth/scraped_110k_comments_from_45000_users_in_527/) back in October.

Basically, I've been running a bot that scrapes ""person defining"" subreddits:

* Political Discussion (/r/progressive, /r/Conservative, /r/socialism, etc).
* Religious / Atheist / Agnostic (/r/Christianity, /r/atheism, etc).
* Activism (/r/occupywallstreet, /r/Anarchist_Strategy, etc).
* Ethnic (/r/Arab, etc).
* National (/r/canada, /r/unitedkingdom, etc).
* Gender Orientated (/r/MensRights, /r/Feminism, etc).
* Racial (/r/niggers, /r/WhiteNationalism, etc).
* Lifestyle (/r/trees, /r/vegan, /r/Frugal  etc).

I store a reference to each post by each person and where it was posted. I've been calculating the overlaps between subreddits and I've also played around with a ""similarity equation"":

&gt;Similarity = AB/(sqrt(A)*sqrt(B)) where A and B is the number of commentators on subreddits A and B, respectively and AB is the overlap.

I can take requests for specific subreddits and give you the results in seconds (if they're recorded).

One of the top comments in the thread [was a suggestion to visit /r/RepublicOfMusic](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/13c9uq/rmusic_the_biggest_missed_chance_on_reddit/c72p7r0). Prior to this, we had around 1,380 subscribers and I was the primary submitter of any material into the subreddit.

[The resulting traffic stats.](http://i.imgur.com/QGEgn.png?1)

A total of 160 new submissions. 126 approvals and 34 removals as we do have rather restrictive rules. This is probably close to the same amount of submissions made in the entire year prior.

C. Choi writes about movie sequels, specifically about how they have value in so far as the general public is exposed to non-mainstream ideas as the sequels proliferate. Her examples include *Twilight* (vampire love) and *Fifty Shades of Grey* (non-traditional love). On page 128, in paragraph 5.1, she says (emphasis mine):

&gt;When material is new, on the other hand, a franchise can open up entire **subreddits** that haven't yet had their day.

On the same page, still referring to movies, she says in paragraph 6.4 (emphasis mine):

&gt;If only there were a way to **upvote** which ones should get made next.

Rather than editorialize, I'll just make a few points and then leave it up for discussion.

* The first example is obvious. There is no other meaning, as of yet, for the phrase  ""subreddit"". The second example is more telling, as there are many other ways to  indicate approval. She didn't say ""vote on"" or ""weigh in"", she said ""upvote"".

* Both terms are used in context, and make perfect sense if you first understand the structure of reddit. I actually found their use here quite clear and concise.

* There is an assumption on her part that the majority of her general audience will understand what these terms mean and will not be thwarted by a barrier of comprehension. At the least, an editor would have removed them if judged an impediment to the column's accessibility. 

* ""Wired"" and reddit are both owned by Conde Nast, in turn owned be Advance Publications, and share office space in New York City. Is reddit leaking? Is it a plant? Or is this point even significant at all?

* What, if anything, does this mean? It is obviously not a coincidence, but is it important? Is it a one off, or a nerdy in-joke? Or is reddit seeping into mainstream culture, even to a small extent? Are reddit terms becoming nouns and verbs, descriptive of larger concepts? Have we spawned synonyms?

* Assuming significance, is this a positive development? Would reddit's cultural tropes becoming IRL jargon hurt or benefit reddit as a whole? Would this help offset some of the bad press, the black eye, that reddit has taken as of late?

**EDIT:** Spelling.

**EDIT 2:** Reddit is no longer owned by Conde Nast, but is an independent entity (reddit, inc.) within the Advance Publications structure. [See here](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/independence.html). Thanks to /u/twentyone_21.

[Invisible Children's response video](http://vimeo.com/38344284) - they talk about some of their on-the-ground projects in the DRC and Central African Republic. 

----

I've been looking at African responses to KONY 2012. [A number of African activists on the ground are very critical of the campaign](http://boingboing.net/2012/03/08/african-voices-respond-to-hype.html). Their position is that Invisible Children is misrepresenting and oversimplifying the issue. This, they argue, does more harm than good.

As far as I can tell, reddit doesn't care what these people have to say. Few of these dissenting voices **from people actually working with the issue** are getting any traction/upvotes. The only threads I've found are on TrueReddit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/qornc/the_kony_video_a_ugandan_journalists_perspective/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/qnhkf/a_very_interesting_ugandan_perspective_on_the/) which didn't really get anywhere at all. The Kony memes race to the top in the meantime.

The result is the establishment of Invisible Children's story as the actual truth, at least here on reddit. That the people of Uganda are waiting for the West to come save them from this monster called Joseph Kony. When the reality is far different from the one Invisible Children created. 

A little while ago I talked about [how hard it is for people of color to even be heard in the world, let alone on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/q0dof/as_a_black_man_i_think_reddit_has_a_race_problem/). The discussion quickly devolves into how offended white people are that we're even *having* this discussion. 

Now a whole message has been hijacked, ostensibly to benefit the people of Uganda, but really only to benefit one organization's attempt to stay relevant. Anyone who criticizes Invisible Children is asked, ""well, what have **you** done?"" or told ""at least they're doing *something.*"" We care more about Invisible Children's good intentions than their actual methods. We care more about the organization than the people it's claiming to help. 

In fact the only criticism that seems to matter is that [Invisible Children only spends 30something percent of its revenues on charity work](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/qkxvm/kony_2012/). Or that this campaign is some sort of secret method to get more American troops into Africa. The fact that Invisible Children completely distorts the reality on the ground in Uganda barely matters.

Posts that make it to the front page and have been vetted by a wider part of the Reddit audience tend not to betray the same tendency, but if you spend any time on the new queue or in some of the smaller subs there just seems to be a lot more evidence of high-income people posting than I've seen anywhere else.

Part of this could be because only a small percentage of users actually contribute, and those who do are probably educated and have free time. But this could be said of most online communities - yet here it just seems much more common.

Personal bias and anecdotal evidence make it hard for me to take my own observation seriously but I just want to see some other opinions on the subject.

Submissions like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pruwg/i_have_10000_dollars_and_i_want_to_start_a/) where the OP basicly has $10,000 to burn through on a gamble that [wouldn't put him out too much](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pruwg/i_have_10000_dollars_and_i_want_to_start_a/c3rqr15) or [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pew6k/i_want_to_quit_my_good_job_and_travel_the_world/) where OP has ""traveled abroad in college, and I like traveling around the country, but I want to experience life outside of 1st world amenities"".

These are extremely common themes that pop up every day here, and maybe I'm alone in this but it's not something I've seen as often anywhere else.

When I first subscribed to /r/firstworldproblems I thought everybody was ""in on a joke theme"" but there's occasionally a divide between some users who post as satire on excessive displays of wealth and privilege vs. those who post observational humor about their own condition - and sometimes members of either group don't realize that the other exists.

* How much money does Reddit make?
* Is Reddit still in some kind of ""start-up"" phase, or is its business model pretty much settled?
* Relatively, how much money does Reddit make from:

2. Advertising?

1370058689.0,60,self.TheoryOfReddit,1fg47m,"Organizing the defaults: thoughts on moderation of large subs, suggestions for improving content quality with currently under-used mod tools",hansjens47,91,31,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1fg47m/organizing_the_defaults_thoughts_on_moderation_of/,"**overview:** This is going to be a long post that covers a lot of different topics concerning the moderation of large/default reddits as large online forums. This post is about the theory of reddit directly, and is therefore best suited to this sub. My goal for this submission is to reach out to mods of large subreddits and have them consider little-used capabilities to easily and greatly improve the quality of their subs. **Boldface serves as a sort of tl;dr.**

**introductory remarks:** With power comes responsibility. Moderating a default is a huge responsibility. However, there's a large group of people that make accounts solely for the purpose of unsubscribing from certain defaults because they find the quality of content too low. This post will assume you wish your sub to aim for higher quality than it currently is.it will outline several methods of improving the quality of any large sub. They will require mod re-organization and time to work. Each individual moderator needs to determine for themselves how seriously they wish to take on that responsibility and how much time they wish to spend moderating, and in what manner they want to spend that time. 

**Reddit is not unique.** Online forums have existed in one form or another for 15+ years. People have learned a lot of lessons over that period of time, but reddit seems to have started back at ground zero when it was created, consequently ignoring years of experience as what works and what doesn't while managing large online forums. 

**Defining moderation:** Moderation is the most powerful tool for influencing how a large community behaves. Let’s start with the basics. Moderation is the act of managing the community by going through its content and ensuring that it complies with either the rules or ideals of the forum. Moderation is not simply deleting spam, it's going through every piece of content that's posted to a forum and ensuring it is up to scratch. Already here reddit deviates from basic common sense established on forums over the years: you need enough mods to go over every piece of content on the forum in a timely fashion. 

**Reddit is heavily under-moderated.** Almost every large sub on reddit is heavily under-moderated; a lot of content is never moderated at all. There simply aren't enough mods to actually go over every piece of content in a timely fashion.  That leads to a simple conclusion: if you have an interest in increasing the quality of your sub, you recruit more mods until you do cover all the content in a timely fashion.

**No change in current policy** Already, some of you will have objections. Free speech, ideals of hands-off moderation, the sub belonging to the community in virtue of being a default and probably many others. Let’s just concern ourselves with removing spamming, trolling, completely off-topic content and single-word replies that add nothing to discussion. This implies no change in any policy on specific subs, simply executing the rules that are currently instated. Hands-off moderation does not work in practice. /r/atheism is the perfect example of that. Communities are not capable of self-moderation, even with an upvote/downvote system, in here that’s just preaching to the choir. Anyone who's led a large forum agrees. These things need to be removed if you want to improve quality, and so **all content must be moderated in a timely fashion.**

**A timely fashion is maybe 10-15 minutes.** That is the timeframe you have before something has time to blow up, either as a troll topic (Unmasturbation comes to mind), or a bad comment train manifests . Many of you are probably already estimating how many mods you'd need to satisfy that timeframe considering the massive volume of content on your sub. Mental math suggests you need 5-10 times the number of mods you currently have. It sounds drastic, it’s not. Other large forums have needed that amount of mods, and have managed mod crews of 150+ effectively. You redditors may be spending more time on the forum than them though, but we're still talking multiples of the current mods (except maybe in /r/askscience). 

**there are several ways of adding new mods.** You may consider adding batches of mods during set trial periods so you can train them together as a group, or you can consider a policy of having a handful of mods always on trial always adding more when trials are completed. You may want to consider having mods whose only task is to guide and introduce new mods, or mod recruiter mods who constantly search for candidates for moderation of your sub. **There’s no way around adding significantly more mods though**

**differentiate mod roles:** Now, it is my understanding that the level of differentiation of mods is low in most subs. In general there is little established hierarchy, and things are done slowly by consensus, or someone finally pulling the trigger. Every community needs different levels of power suited to differentiated roles. This is something online communities are very aware of. Even 5man pro-gaming teams have a leader and 4 followers, online guilds, clans, and every other online forum have power structures and specialized roles/tasks.


**specific mod roles** Now, with a hierarchy of mods, you can recruit new mods for specific roles. People to specifically go through comments and new posts doing content moderation, others who deal with CSS, bans, modmail, changes to rules etc. Specialization is the road to maximizing utility. 


**you need a power structure.** If there currently is no leader, elect one within the mods. Elect a group of leaders, but not too many. You need a shot-caller. Someone who's ultimately in charge of ensuring things get done, someone to delegate specific tasks to specific people. Worst case scenario, have every current mod be a “leader mod” and every subsequent mod not be one. Bulky leadership leads to inefficiency and delays. 

**You can have a team based on respect with a hierarchy.** It is equally valuable to the betterment of the sub if you spend your time reading through comments and removing inappropriate ones as it is spending that same amount of time going through modmail, working on CSS or any other task. They’re simply different tasks. If people cannot see that, they're not mature enough to be mods. there's no reason why a topic on ideas for a rule change cannot have ideas fielded from everyone who's a mod in any respect, even if it's ""just"" someone who trawls /new and removes inappropriate comments. Being respected, heard and appreciated are different from being the final decision-maker. It’s all about good processes, just like in any offline organization. 


**The keys to successful moderation teams are communication and organization.** You need lead mods to organize other mods. If you have 30 mods who are tasked with reading comments and removing inappropriate ones, you recruit people who extensively read comments as it is. You hardly change their behavior, you simply give responsible commenters moderation powers. No inactivity arises from someone ""doing all the moderation"" because all those mods would be reading the comments anyway. They just have to press the remove button less often. 


**recruiting more mods does not marginalize current mods.** Currently there are a host of incentives against recruiting more mods. The more mods, the less special your green rank is, the less of a power user, the less important you feel. With different types and levels of moderators, that is no longer true. Current mods don't lose anything by recruiting content-specific mods who trawl comments and /new. They have no other powers; their positions are never advertised as having other roles. Your position as a senior mod is not impacted by having a slew of mods with green names. Your distinct “senior mod color” could be a red username in Helvetica to distinguish you from the “content mod” green. Your impact as a mod isn't lessened because you now organize mods rather than doing all the hands-on stuff. You manage and delegate, direct, deal with policy and so on. It does not matter if you have 50-200 content mods under you who sign up knowing they’re there to do the dirty work.


I reiterate: no new policy, your sub still belongs to the community. It’s simply spam-free and ribbed of dead content without value. 


**The longer you put off adding mods, the worse it becomes.** A recent post asking for moderators in a default (I forget which one it was in) noted the community was now over 3.5 million subscribers or something, so 1-2 more mods were needed. This outlines the current problems. Mods in defaults are terribly over-worked. It only gets worse as the surplus within the group of mods is constantly dwindling due to constantly growing communities. The more you put it off, the worse it is to add more mods.

**Concerns and responses:** 

0. 10-15 minutes is unreasonable and unmangeable. **A:** The specific number can serve as a goal. 30 minutes is easily manageable. Subscribers who are capable of moderating this content already read it all within that time-frame, they simply lack mod tools. We all know how under-used the report and modmail functions are. 

1. We may become unpopular if we remove more content. **A:** Users already agree to follow rediquette and the rules of your subreddit. You’re simply enforcing those rules. Individual people can become unpopular in cases where the messenger is shot. But at the end of the day, users don't have much of a choice, they're fish in the sea. they can spend time in /r/askreddit, or they can leave. they really don't get a say. Results speak louder than words. People will appreciate spam-free communities. That’s the reason smaller subs exist that fill the same niches defaults do. 

2. We can’t organize this many mods **A:** Remember, these aren’t mods that are meant to be teams of 100+ people who all have input on decisions. These are mods with different roles, and everyone is rarely involved in a certain topic. You currently organize hundreds of thousands or millions of people. You’re clearly capable of creating a subforum for the daily running of the sub, mod issues and discussions. 

3. I’m against differentiated mod powers. **A:** Mods cannot nuke your sub if they have limited powers. You can track moderator actions and activity in the mod subreddit and remove mods that don't do anything. The whole culture of every mod being equal leads to a catch-22 situation where there's no way of moderating content and no way of adding enough mods to moderate content.

4. This seems like an awful lot of work. **A:** Some work is involved initially, but then your  mod burden significantly decreases. Here’s a really simple way of starting out. Simply add a new tier of mod, the “comment and /new” mod. They only get permissions to moderate comments and posts and simply remove poor comment that is in breach of current rules. Everything else stays as it is currently. You can add a mod-talk forum to organize if needed. 

5. Redditing is supposed to be a leisure activity! **A:** This is exactly why more moderation is needed. the concept of people creating reddit accounts to unsubscribe from defaults is evidence that too little moderation ruins the leisure and socially relaxed atmosphere. All the defaults are understaffed and it's lowering their quality of content significantly. 

6. I currently mod multiple large subs. **A:** To make an analogy, there's no reason you can't mod 3 or 5 defaults. That’s like sitting on the board of 3-5 similar companies. but you certainly can't work full time for 3-5 different companies. That’s where content-mods come in: they have a pre-existing special interest in the comments and content of a single sub and already spend large amounts of time there. You can't effectively be a content-mod of several large subs without seriously diminishing returns.



**Conclusion:** I urge you to reorganize the leadership of your large sub. Consider adding a slew of new mods so your sub actually becomes a moderated forum. askscience is good at removing off-topic content, but their timeliness has room for improvement. They have a team of 51mods, and that’s still not enough. This will not take a lot of effort, and will reduce your current workloads significantly after an initial labor investment. 

Again, I want to stress that increased moderation as discussed here changes no rule, no policy. it effectuates current policy with an emphasis on ""in a timely fashion"" so users don't see content that is already removed whenever it's noticed. But it's removed before it affects a lot of people. this is paramount to re-establishing an atmosphere people don't go out of their way to leave. Default mods, you’re our only hope!

Will reddit be online in 10 years? How about 30 years. Will they care about the heritage of comments and posts we created here?

Ok, that is why I am asking if I can liberate my data. I'd like to download all pages where I commented or voted, ever since I started using the site under a user name.

You might want to point out that I could click my user name and see the history in there, but I don't think the rabbit hole goes all the way. I think it is cut off at 1000 items or some random limit.

So, I want to ask you:

1. Is this an issue we care about or is it just me?

2. Is there an already worked out system to get one's personal data out?

I hope you will not dismiss this out of hand. At least one user cares deeply about his reddit legacy, and there is a non zero chance that many users do.

Wouldn't it be great if we could use IMAP or something to pull our history in a similar way we can get out Gmail emails out?

I'm not even going to say which subreddits are involved, because that's irrelevant to the TheoryOfReddit discussion. **Drama belongs in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/sv7p3/srs_will_be_bringing_out_a_bot_that_autobans/), not here**; that is also where you'll find evidence, but it's not terribly exciting. Even if the bot is deployed, it will just be automating a task that had already been done manually, from time to time.

My question for ToR is, what are the justifications and risks for banning users based on their post/comment history in *other subreddits*? What if they've always followed the rules of your subreddit when they've posted in it? What if they've never posted in it? What if they've never even heard of it? Or, what if they're actually longtime, popular contributors but didn't realize their activities outside the subreddit would get them banned?

It seems like there are certainly some situations where this is natural to do: it's easy to spot a troll or novelty account that wanders around reddit posting ""nigger jew fag"" garbage, or cat facts, or what have you. More hazy: you moderate a subreddit where medical advice is not allowed (e.g. /r/AskScience, /r/AskReddit) and someone wanders around reddit either requesting or pretending to dispense it, but hasn't yet done that in yours. Getting iffy: someone in another subreddit is discussing plans to troll your subreddit. Probably over the line: someone in another subreddit is simply criticizing the way you moderate yours. **Where is that line** between valid and invalid reasons to ban someone from subreddit X because of something they did in subreddit Y?

The alleged future use of bots escalates this dramatically and could theoretically lead to subreddit warfare. /u/Xincedie, who's been tracking this drama, suggests some hypotheticals:

&gt; The /r/Politics mods really don't like the moderators in /r/AdviceAnimals. So the /r/Politics mods in order to spite the /r/AdviceAnimals mods use the bot to ban everyone who posts in /r/AdviceAnimals from /r/Politics. Now, this is going to cause massive, massive drama of epic proportions. /r/Subredditdrama will be in a flood of popcorn but, it seriously affects the average redditors experience. Newbie redditor posts to /r/AdviceAnimals and then finds himself banned from /r/Politics, massive drama.

&gt; [separate comment]

&gt; Powerful, popular subreddits like /r/Pics have the most power in these scenarios.

One irony in the particular case of autobanning from subreddit X anyone who ever posts in subreddit Y is that subscribers of X can no longer go to Y to defend X from criticism. /u/Xincedie again: ""Looks like they've made their own Berlin wall!""

&gt;When a moderator approves a spam filtered link it will be put into the new listing with the current time (moving it to the front). Previous behavior was to put it into the new listing with its creation time. Depending on the age of the link and the popularity of the subreddit that could cause the link to never show up in new, dooming it to no views and no votes.

&gt;This boost to the front of the new listing only works for links that were spam filtered, and it only works once per link (hopefully preventing shenanigans).

&gt;Note that this doesn't change the date used in determining a link's 'hot' score. The creation date is still used, but that's not too damaging because 12.5 hours of lag is equivalent to only 10 upvotes. This won't change until there's a drastic overhaul of the code, so don't ask for it.

/u/Deimorz (creator of /r/AutoModerator) left an interesting comment in response:

&gt;This is by far one of the most requested changes, so I'm really happy to see this. However, some things to note:

&gt;This only works once for each submission. If something is approved out of spam, then re-removed, and re-approved, its final position will be based on the submission time, not either of the approval times.

&gt;&gt;Note that this doesn't change the date used in determining a link's 'hot' score. The creation date is still used, but that's not too damaging because 12.5 hours of lag is equivalent to only 10 upvotes.

&gt;This isn't really true, that's only true for the first 10 upvotes. The ""voting score"" component of the post's ranking is logarithmic, it's more accurate to say something like 12.5 hours of lag is equivalent to 90% of the upvotes. A post with 1000 score has equal ranking as one with 100 score submitted exactly 12.5 hours later. That's far from only 10 upvotes. So something unfiltered 12.5 hours after submission is going to require 10x higher score to achieve an equal ranking to if it had been unfiltered immediately. So this is a decent fix that's definitely appreciated, but still not quite what people have been asking for.

Personally I'm both surprised and excited that this has been implemented. In the default subreddits, this change will mean a chance at life instead of death for any submission left in the spam filter for more than 15m, which happens frequently. It's disappointing that it doesn't change the ""hot"" ranking, but as bsimpson pointed out, that would require a major overhaul of the reddit code, which isn't going to happen any time soon.",,False,,t5_2rtff,True,,,True,t3_sgrsy,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/sgrsy/submissions_approved_in_the_spam_filter_now_move/,

These days, we tend to think of it as a kind of etiquette that guys exercise toward ""the weaker sex,"" but that isn't the sense I'm using it in here.

Rather, what I have in mind is the code of conduct associated with the Knights of the New [--](http://chaoslife.findchaos.com/?p=96) you know: those tireless redditors who actually visit the new queue of a given reddit and give the first handful of up votes that will, by and large, determine the fate of most submissions. Currently, it doesn't look like they're operating by a code. But what's a knight without a code?

What I suggest is that we help draft a code. Whether or not any KotN actually cares to adopt it is their business, but I think it's worthwhile having a set of ""best practices"" that would help Reddit in those crucial early moments just after a redditor submits a link. We should shoot for brevity and clarity so that the Knights can keep it in mind when they browse -- if you to have to refer back to a FAQ somewhere just to remember what's on the code, you probably won't bother with it. 
Part of the problem with the reddiquette these days is that it's so bloated that most people can't be bothered to apply it anymore. So I think that we should probably be shooting for a code with no more than 3-5 simple, general statements.

Just for starters, I'll suggest this:

* Report and down vote submissions that break the rules of the reddit to which they were submitted.

That came to mind because just about every time I check in on /r/all, I'll see at least one /r/funny submission that's a webcomic that someone has rehosted to imgur. I know that /r/funny has a rule saying that rehosted comics will be removed, so I usually try to report infractions of that rule. But the question is, how does it get all the way to the front page? Part of the answer, of course, is that a lot of people are voting on it from their own front page, rather than from /r/funny, and they're not paying attention to the sub it's from or the rules that apply. But in a swiftly-moving default like /r/funny, most submissions don't get to even that point unless they're already on that sub's front page, and they don't get on a sub's front page without some help from the Knights. So having a code that puts the Knights more in line with the rules of a sub can help take some of the workload off of the mods and prevent bad situations in which rule-breaking submissions make it to the front of the entire site.

1326493987.0,60,self.TheoryOfReddit,og1l1,"Moderator statistics round 2 - this time down to 1000 subscribers, and including activity info",Deimorz,77,17,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/og1l1/moderator_statistics_round_2_this_time_down_to/,"Earlier this week, [I submitted some data and statistics about moderators of 5000+-subscriber subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/o75r7/data_and_statistics_for_moderators_of/). There was a fair amount of interest in it, and I got some good suggestions from a few people, so I decided to do a second round at it, including more subreddits and also fetching some more detailed data about each moderator.

Probably the most important difference is that this time I'm going to be noting how many moderators are ""probably active"" or ""probably inactive"". Since I don't have access to moderation logs, this is based on their public activity, the same as you'd see by clicking on the user's name anywhere on reddit (comments/submissions). I decided to denote someone as ""probably active"" **if they have made at least 25 comments/submissions in the last 10 days**. Yes, this is pretty arbitrary, but from looking at the way it split up the list of moderators I believe it to have a pretty strong correlation with whether they moderate actively or not. I'm going to omit the word ""probably"" in the charts to save space.

A second new thing I'm adding to look at is ""puppet/bot"" users. These are users that are moderators, but have suspiciously low public activity and karma (conditions used were: less than 25 activities ever, and less than 100 combined karma + a few manual additions). Some examples are the various ""generic mod"" accounts in the default subreddits like PicsMod, funny_mod, etc. as well as the bots for various purposes (often flair-related) like BigFriendlyRobot. Whenever I count ""mods"" in the statistics, I attempt to exclude these users, but like the above, it's not completely foolproof. Counts of these specific types of users will be under ""bots"".

With those defined, on with the statistics again. Like last time, I'm going to be excluding the three ""official"" subreddits (blog, announcements, reddit.com) from every statistic. Deleted/banned users are also excluded from all counts. All statistics only consider subreddits with at least 1000 subscribers.

This whole process of upvoting and downvoting. What we know from behavioral psychology/classical conditioning is this: because of the punitive effects of being downvoted, combined with the social peer-driven praise of being upvoted, over time redditors will learn to filter or otherwise edit their thoughts, opinions, etc. in order to maximize their Reddit score. The system is based on this. The dangerous combination of two elements: competition and conformity.

Over time, Reddit becomes not a forum where people can openly offer their ideas and input, but rather a popularity-driven church of common opinion. An expert opinion on a topic offered by a fifty-year old someone with legitimate insight or expertise is harshly downvoted by a twelve-year-old for no criteria other than they're communicating on two different levels with two different sets of tastes and experience.

To make matters worse, other Redditors see that downvoting score and are subject to ""bandwagoning."" The opinion receives additional downvotes which exacerbates the punitive social effect.

Interestingly, this tight system of reward and punishment even has its own terminology which further regulates and dictates this situation. For redditors who comply we use positive associate words and imagery like ""Gold."" For redditors who don't conform we apply negative imagery (e.g. to be ""downvoted into oblivion"")

Sigh. As much as I like what Reddit attempts to accomplish, I fear that participants are being conditioned over time to disregard their personal opinions (opinions which should be encouraged and celebrated) and instead fall into step and..umm...""become one with the Borg.""

Behavioral psychologists know that the most powerful form of reinforcement, positive or negative, is not one that occurs as a consequence every time a behavior occurs, but rather when it is provided irregularly.

That's what makes, for example, slot machines so insidious. They don't reward every time, but rather intermittently.

Same now with Reddit. The fuzzy karma system gives points large and small at a strange, irregular frequency. That intensifies the psychology of the karma system and its upvotes and downvotes. Upvotes are sought after more, downvotes are more painful. 

The Reddit infrastructure now has a very powerful reinforcement mechanism, combined with the two elements mentioned above: competition and conformity (or, maybe more specifically, the need for social approval).

Reddit: time to dismantle the karma system!!!!

Not being able to even see subreddit rules defeats the purpose of having them.

So, can anything be done to push app developers to include the sidebar information in a submission page? Now that sidebar information is available [separately](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/about/sidebar), it's certainly possible. They're just not doing it.

Another aspect of this problem is that the main reddit submit page doesn't load the subreddit's sidebar either. Both issues are part of a general problem of people submitting to a sub without the sub's rules ever being on their screen.

Some questions:

1. How big a problem are app submissions for other mods? Is this even a knowable answer?
1. Which is a bigger problem: app submissions or submissions from the ~~main~~ frontpage submission screen?
1. Any ideas or proposed solutions?

But, in browsing /r/all, I get distracted by the degenerate meme/imgur crap while trying to scan the top 200 links.   Also, I suspect many people are like me, and use the subscribe feature as a sort of lazy bookmark.  As such, my personal reddit.com is now a somewhat unsatisfying random sampling of 50 out of 200+ niche subreddits.  I feel the following combo alerts me to most of the interesting stuff going on here, while only giving me about 10% fluff.  However, with the size of reddit, this combo still feels really damn small.  

Spending less time on reddit is a big deal for me, but there are still many useful links and discussions that I don't want to miss.  Does anyone else have subreddit combos that they use on a daily basis?  Mine is the following, and I'd like to know what information-oriented subreddits are missing:

1. /r/AdviceAnimals
* /r/AskReddit
* /r/announcements
* /r/atheism
* /r/aww 
* /r/bestof 
* /r/blog
* /r/funny 
* /r/gaming 
* /r/IAmA 
* /r/movies 
* /r/music
* /r/news  
* /r/pics 
* /r/politics 
* /r/science 
* /r/technology 
* /r/todayilearned 
* /r/videos 
* /r/worldnews 
* /r/WTF 

If I could completely change the rules in any default subreddit, I think I would pick /r/atheism. It might be a bit of a conflict of interest, seeing as how I currently moderate /r/atheism, but every moderator does things a bit differently and I think if we had 100 different top moderators in a given subreddit we could have 100 different versions of that subreddit, it all comes down to personal preference and what rules a moderator chooses to implement and enforce.

Before I begin this thought experiment, I know there has been a lot of drama surrounding /r/atheism recently, and it is not my intention to stir the hornet's nest any further in that regard. If you've been living under a rock for the last month, a [quick search over at /r/SubredditDrama should fill you in.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/search?q=atheism&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) I don't want this thread to be a discussion about drama, so please keep any such comments over there.

I know that /r/atheism has traditionally been moderated in a very hands-off style, and the userbase has been extremely resistant to recent changes over there. Let us imagine that we are in an alternate universe, where /r/atheism has been actively moderated since its creation, so for the sake of this discussion, there would be no drama surrounding any rule changes that would be introduced.

The first thing I would do would be completely ban image submissions. In my experience, if a subreddit of any significant size allows direct image submissions, they quickly overwhelm all other content. If you look at the rest of the defaults, they have all either completely banned images, or images make up 90% or more of the submitted  content. I would use /u/AutoModerator to automatically remove all image submissions. If a subreddit like /r/AtheismRebooted already existed, I would heavily promote that subreddit and refer all removed submissions over there. **Disclaimer:** I do not feel that a blanket ban on images would be good for the *current* /r/atheism at all, because the community would not be happy about it. This is simply what I would have done from the beginning had I been the creator of /r/atheism all along.

There would be two exceptions to the image rule. First of all, if a user were to submit a well-written self-post, and that self post happened to contain a link to one or more images, obviously that would be allowed and would be an exception to the ban on images. Self posts that contain nothing but a link to an image would be removed. Submissions with an [IMG] or [Image] tag would be removed.

The second exception to the ban on images would be webcomics. Direct linking to webcomics would be allowed, but only if the link pointed to the original source of the comic, and not to imgur or some other image hosting service. It would eliminate reposts, as you can't submit the same link to the same subreddit twice, and it would ensure that any ad revenue generated from the exposure went directly to the artist.

I would conduct all policy discussion in full view of the public. Much like /r/PornOverlords, the policy discussion subreddit for the SFWPorn Network, I would use /r/AtheismPolicy to conduct *all* policy discussion, but there would be strict rules, and anyone who is trolling or harassing the moderators would be warned and repeat offenders would be banned.

I would let anyone who wanted to be a moderator become one. Absolutely anyone. There would be limits to how *quickly* the moderation team could grow, perhaps a limit of 5 new mods per week, but we would always be accepting moderator applications, a list would be made, and we would be recruiting and training new moderators as fast as possible. We have the mod log, so any damage a rogue moderator could do would be quickly found and reversed by the other moderators. I would give only 1-3 moderators access to the sidebar &amp; css, because those shouldn't really be changed without discussion or by someone without experience.

Moderators have complete control over their subreddits, and there is no reliable way to poll the userbase about potential rule changes - any poll will always be subject to manipulation by other subreddits or even from outside sources entirely like Facebook and Twitter. However, if you give forum regulars the opportunity to join the moderator team, and have a solid system of policy discussion where every moderator has an equal vote, you can begin to approach something resembling an actual democracy on reddit. It's never been done before on any subreddit (to my knowledge), let alone a default subreddit, but I think it would be a very interesting experiment.",,False,,t5_2rtff,1372057011.0,,,True,t3_1gycsb,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1gycsb/if_you_could_completely_change_the_rules_of_any/,

Here's the original blog post: http://www.randalolson.com/2013/03/12/retracing-the-evolution-of-reddit-through-post-data/

---

Have you ever wondered how the Reddit community has changed since it started in 2005? I've only been active on Reddit since late 2011, so I've always been curious how Reddit looked before I came along. In this post, I try to retrace the evolution of the Reddit community from its inception in 2005 up to November 2012 by analyzing the posts that users submitted to Reddit over time.

**The current state of Reddit**

What does the Reddit community look like right now? Where do people submit their posts to? The graph below answers those questions at least in part by showing the number of posts that were submitted to each of the most active subreddits in the first week of November 2012.

[Graph: current subreddit distribution](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthCurrentDistribution.png)

If you're familiar with Reddit, the top 5 subreddits are to be expected: /r/funny, /r/AskReddit, /r/AdviceAnimals, /r/pics, and /r/aww. Four of them are focused on sharing pictures, and /r/AskReddit is used to ask questions of and share stories with other Redditors. Together, these five subreddits account for the majority of the content on the Reddit default front page nowadays.

The next 6 subreddits are a little more interesting. /r/trees (a subreddit dedicated to discussing marijuana), /r/politics, /r/Music, and /r/gaming capture the main interests of most Redditors, who are typically [20-something American male college students](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/07/who-in-world-is-reddit.html). Finally, /r/videos and /r/WTF are two more media-based subreddits.

From this brief survey, it becomes abundantly clear that the primary content of Reddit nowadays is pictures and videos. This trend makes sense, too: pictures are easy content to produce and take only a few seconds to look at, enjoy, and upvote. For better or for worse, Reddit's karma system favors pictures and short videos, and I expect there to be an ever-increasing trend of more pictures and fewer text-based posts.

I should note here that there are [thousands of active Reddit communities](http://stattit.com/subreddits/by_online_avg_1d/) nowadays, and I have made some broad generalizations here based off of the most popular subreddits. Put away the torches and pitch forks, please!

**How Reddit has changed over time**

Now that we know what the Reddit community looks like today, how did it look in the past? The graph below shows how 24 of the most active subreddits have changed over time. I ordered the subreddits by the time that they first appeared on Reddit. I recommend zooming in so you can see it better.

(I should note that I purposely excluded /r/reddit.com from this graph because it dominates the entire graph until about 2008, then screws things up again when it got closed down in late 2011.)

[Subreddit growth over time measured by fraction of posts submitted to each subreddit](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-all-time.png)

The biggest thing that you may notice is that there were very few subreddits from 2006-2008. In fact, there was only one subreddit before 2006 (/r/reddit.com). The majority of the content in 2006-2008 was focused on more techie-friendly subjects: programming, science, politics,  entertainment, and gaming. Major subreddits dedicated to solely picture and video content started becoming popular in mid-2008, and even then their posts only comprised less than 1/4 of Reddit's content. It wasn't until 2011 did the picture-related subreddits really start taking over, and Reddit never looked back after that.

This graph covers so many changes in the Reddit community that it can't explain what happened by itself. In the following sections, I will take a closer look at how the Reddit community evolved on a year-by-year basis.

**2005 - The Reddean Eon**

Reddit didn't show any signs of life until Thursday, June 23, 2005, when Reddit /u/ChickenLittle submitted the [first post on record to Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/91/wired_news_beware_the_google_threat/) warning everyone about the threat that Google poses to our privacy in the future.

[2005 - The Reddean Eon](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-2005.png)

There wasn't really anything interesting happening during this time period, but I had to include it for posterity. At this point, Reddit only had a single subreddit: /r/reddit.com. This period marks the early development of Reddit by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, when they added core features like the ""hot"" page ranking (which is now default for the front page) and persistent upvotes.

**2006 - The Archreddean Eon**

2006 is finally when things get interesting! Presumably after one too many complaints about getting caught looking at pictures of breasts ""on accident"" on Reddit, they added the very first subreddit specifically for NSFW content: /r/NSFW. As you can see in the graph, people immediately started using it, showing how eager Redditors are to share NSFW content. It's amusing to read [their curt blog post about making the new subreddit](http://blog.reddit.com/2006/01/for-those-of-you-with-private-office.html), where they state:

| We'll be playing around with more of these sub-sections to reddit in the future. Should be fun.

I guess they didn't know that they had stumbled into an idea that would later make Reddit what it is today.

[2006 - The Archeddean Eon](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-2006.png)

You'll notice in February, the number of subreddits suddenly spikes. Sure enough, following the Reddit blog, they started adding all kinds of subreddits during February: [Olympics, feature request, and subreddit request subreddits](http://blog.reddit.com/2006/02/its-about-time-we-added-something-new.html); [language-specific subreddits](http://blog.reddit.com/2006/02/reddit-becomes-multilingual.html); and [yet more language-specific subreddits](http://blog.reddit.com/2006/02/more-languages-and-shoutout-in-english.html). A few more topical subreddits showed up later as well, which are vaguely mentioned in the blogs. For the most part, though, Reddit's content came from /r/reddit.com, which acted as a catch-all for everything else.

*Notable subreddits born this year*

/r/programming, /r/science

*Notable subreddits died this year*

Most of the language subreddits died before they even had a chance. Survival of the fittest!

**2007 - The Protereddoic Eon**

2007 marks the extinction of all but two of the remaining language-specific subreddits that hadn't already died. The main techie-friendly subreddits (/r/programming and /r/science) thrived, while /r/lipstick.com (a celebrity gossip subreddit) seems to have been supplanted by a more general /r/entertainment subreddit.

[2007 - The Protereddoic Eon](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-2007.png)

The biggest change in subreddits that we can see here is the explosive emergence of /r/politics. It seems like Redditors in 2007 were dying to have a politically oriented subreddit, seeing how the subreddit grew to take up 20% of the total submissions to Reddit in a matter of a few months. Sure enough, looking at the blogs again, we can confirm just that: [/r/politics was an addition by popular demand](http://blog.reddit.com/2007/08/politics-reddit.html). Redditors of 2007 were so politically-oriented that they had /r/obama created over a year before the election!

*Notable subreddits born this year*

/r/politics, /r/entertainment, /r/business, /r/gaming, /r/gadgets, /r/sports

*Notable subreddits died this year*

The rest of the language subreddits except for the Japanese and Italian subreddits. They really liked Reddit!

The rest of the subreddits dedicated to outside blogs: /r/lipstick.com, /r/joel.

**2008 - Reddit's Cambrian Explosion**

If you've been following the graphs, January of each year always seems to bring a whirlwind of change to Reddit. 2008 was no exception.

[2008 - Reddit's Cambrian Explosion](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-2008.png)

This year, we see an explosion in the diversity of subreddits. What the heck happened? As it turns out, [Reddit added a feature](http://blog.reddit.com/2008/01/new-features.html) for users to create their own subreddit. Almost immediately, people created /r/pics, /r/funny, /r/WTF, and many other subreddits dedicated to pictures. In just the matter of a few months, 1/3 of Reddit's content was sorted from /r/reddit.com into subreddits dedicated to specific topics. Thanks to the new ""create your own subreddit"" feature, Redditors were able to sort the majority of their own content out into the proper forums. The Reddit system works! Cool!

It's also pretty cool to see the spike in posts to /r/politics and /r/obama near election time in November, showing just how active Reddit was in the Presidential election. It seems even from the early years, Reddit was a politically-oriented web site.

I was interested in just how many subreddits were created in this time period, so I graphed ""subreddit diversity"" over time.

[Subreddit diversity over time](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/UniqueSubredditsSubmittedToOverTime.png)

Panel A shows the very gradual increase in subreddits from 2006-2008 as Reddit's managers slowly added subreddits by request. Panel B shows the huge blip in the number of subreddits during the ""create your own subreddit"" beta period, then the crash when they ended the beta period, then finally the never-ending diversification of subreddits as Redditors were officially allowed to create their own subreddit. As of November 2012, there were as many as 14,000 different subreddits active at once, and I'm sure it's kept growing since then!

*Notable subreddits born this year*

/r/AskReddit was born on January 25th, 2008 when some Redditors noticed that ""Ask Reddit"" was becoming a popular posting trend. Sadly, [the only questions asked that day](http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/by_id/t3_66l54,t3_66kkt) were questions about how the subreddit would work.

/r/gonewild was born on December 19th, 2008 as an [awkward conversation between a bunch of guys talking about showing each other their penises](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/7kkwx/greate_idea_for_a_subreddit_but_who_will/). Oh, internets!

/r/pics, /r/funny, /r/environment, /r/worldnews, /r/Libertarian, /r/technology, /r/WTF, /r/offbeat, /r/space, /r/reportthespammers, /r/Atheism, /r/Christianity, and many many more. Sorry if I didn't list your favorite subreddit that was born during this time -- there's so many!

*Notable subreddits died this year*

Surprisingly, none! Though I'm sure many subreddits tried to start up and died during this period.

**2009 - The Great /r/reddit.com Spike**

By the end of 2008, over 2/3 of Reddit's content had been sorted into specific subreddits, which is quite impressive considering 80% of Reddit's content was being posted to the catch-all /r/reddit.com just a year and half earlier. 2009 seemed to be much of the same of 2008, with yet more content filtering into subject-specific subreddits and /r/reddit.com becoming increasingly obsolete.

[2009 - The Great /r/reddit.com Spike](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-2009.png)

Then in June, something weird happened: a huge spike in /r/reddit.com posts! I've looked all over the blog and scoured the Internet and can't find a reasonable explanation for this spike. Do any Redditors from 2009 know why?

What's not shown in this graph but shows up in the data: even up through 2009, there were very few pornography-centric subreddits. Either /r/NSFW and /r/gonewild handled most of Reddit's needs at the time, or Reddit just wasn't the place for pornography in 2009.

*Notable subreddits born this year*

/r/IAmA was born on May 28, 2009 with a series of IAmA posts by [people from all walks of life](http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/by_id/t3_8ntin,t3_8nwxw,t3_8nye6,t3_8ns44,t3_8nt2l,t3_8nyon,t3_8ntn3,t3_8ntdy,t3_8nsc8,t3_8nzgc,t3_8nt80,t3_8nt9o,t3_8nui5,t3_8o1gi,t3_8ns0u,t3_8nsx9,t3_8nt58,t3_8nvur,t3_8nwfj,t3_8nyv3,t3_8o0xa,t3_8nwhi,t3_8ns2i,t3_8nron,t3_8ntgo,t3_8nu4b,t3_8nveq,t3_8nzwp,t3_8nst7,t3_8nxq9,t3_8nt8p,t3_8ntak,t3_8nyko,t3_8ns93,t3_8nsq4,t3_8nsx8,t3_8nt1v,t3_8nusp,t3_8o1wh,t3_8nsl9,t3_8nudn,t3_8nsrk,t3_8nsrr,t3_8nw9f,t3_8nyau,t3_8o0b4,t3_8nsre,t3_8ntvi,t3_8nu7k,t3_8nts4,t3_8o03k,t3_8nsa8,t3_8nsr2,t3_8nt6c,t3_8nx0k,t3_8nx4e,t3_8nz2i).

/r/todayilearned was born on January 2nd, 2009 with [a post about how carrots were originally purple](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/7mvgo/today_i_learned_that_carrots_were_originally/,) which I am fairly positive has been reposted at least once.

/r/trees was born on October 15th, 2009 with [a series of fantastically on-topic posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/by_id/t3_9uhy5,t3_9ug38,t3_9uezt,t3_9uhv8,t3_9uhx6,t3_9uhym,t3_9ug60,t3_9ug6h,t3_9uhxm,t3_9ug52,t3_9uhvx,t3_9ug77).

/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu, /r/circlejerk, /r/DoesAnybodyElse, /r/listentothis, /r/tf2, /r/TwoXChromosomes, /r/SuicideWatch

*Notable subreddits died this year*

/r/gossip, /r/pornography (a short-lived effort to share pornography on Reddit)

The final language-specific subreddits originally created in 2006, /r/it (Italy) and /r/ja (Japan), died off in favor of country-specific subreddits created by the users.

**2010 - The Year Gamers and Porn Invaded**

If it wasn't obvious in 2009, you can't miss the fact that this is the time period Reddit became less techie-focused and more like it is today. /r/politics was supplanted by /r/AskReddit and the picture-related subreddits, while all the stoners crowded to /r/trees to discuss [""fucking trees, guys.""](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/trees.png) Interestingly, there appears to be a decline in all of the techie-friendly subreddits at the end of 2010, when the Digg exodus was in full force. /r/gonewild also seems to have started growing in popularity during the Digg exodus (not shown here -- it was still very small), so maybe Redditors have something to thank Digg for!

[2010 - The Year Gamers and Porn Invaded](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-2010.png)

Meanwhile, /r/gaming and gaming-related subreddits continued to grow in popularity throughout 2010. What's really neat is this is the first year you can see subreddits exploding in size over a short period of time because of the release of a game: /r/starcraft for StarCraft II in June 2010 (hype for the release of the game the next month) and /r/Minecraft in July 2010 (when it started getting international media attention).

Apparently spammers became a huge problem on Reddit in 2010, since reports on /r/reportthespammers comprised at least 10% of Reddit's submissions on a weekly basis. *Thanks*, Obama.

*Notable subreddits born this year*

/r/ColbertRally had a short-lived spike in the months immediately before and after the rally happened. It's really neat how you can detect the big political events that Reddit participates in by looking at these spikes!

/r/leagueoflegends, /r/wow, /r/buildapc, and many more gaming-related subreddits.

*Notable subreddits died this year*

/r/RapidshareList died as quickly as it came to life, peaking out at over 5,000 submissions in the week before it died (as many as the top subreddits at the time). Did someone get busted?

/r/Marijuana went down in flames as /r/trees took over.

**2011 - The Year /r/reddit.com Died**

Ah, 2011. [The year Reddit lost an old friend](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/10/saying-goodbye-to-old-friend-and.html). After seeing /r/reddit.com still host 20% of Reddit's content after two years of trying to get rid of it, I'm sure the Reddit administrators got sick of waiting for /r/reddit.com to be replaced by topic-specific subreddits and finally decided to pull the plug. While it was sad to see /r/reddit.com go -- it was a great catch-all subreddit, after all -- we have been afforded a rare opportunity to see how removing a massive subreddit can affect an online community. Now, let's take a look...

(I should note that I moved /r/reddit.com to the top of the graph here so its removal at the end doesn't cause a wave in all the other subreddit's areas.)

[2011 - The Year the /r/reddit.com Died](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-2011.png)

For the most part, Reddit's transition to picture-focused content continued just as it did in 2010. Memes starting sprouting up all over Reddit: rage comics (/r/f7u12), First World Problems, Advice Animals... many of our favorite memes first appeared on Reddit in 2011. Fewer people talked about politics, world news, etc. and instead preferred the easy laughs and upvotes that memes offered. Using [stattit.com's subreddit time machine](http://stattit.com/time_machine/), we can see how dramatically the front page shifted during this time period:

In late October, /r/reddit.com was shut down for good and Reddit's community shifted dramatically because of it. It looks like /r/pics experienced a temporary bloat in submissions (likely pictures coming from /r/reddit.com), then suddenly the number of submissions to /r/pics shrunk. Shortly thereafter, the images from /r/pics moved to the other image subreddits (/r/funny, /r/f7u12, /r/AdviceAnimals, /r/WTf, and /r/aww) for some reason. Apparently, the /r/pics mods decided they didn't like the sudden influx of meme pictures to their subreddit, and consequently cracked down on submissions and pushed them off to more specialized subreddits. /r/funny and /r/AdviceAnimals seemed happy to take the majority of those submissions, and quickly became the most active subreddits.

By the way, it's fascinating that you can still see spikes in gaming subreddits when games are released. This year, the big spikes happened in /r/battlefield3 for its October release, and /r/skyrim for its November release. I should also note here that Minecraft, Starcraft, and TF2 have done a great job of maintaining active communities around their respective video games!

*Notable subreddits born this year*

/r/occupywallstreet sprang to life in late 2011, showing that Reddit was still politically active enough to rally around a common cause (despite the waning popularity of /r/politics).

Bronies everywhere came together at /r/mylittlepony to rejoice in all that is wonderful about My Little Pony. I've never understood the appeal myself, but it's undeniable that /r/mylittlepony was (and still is) an active part of the Reddit community!

*Notable subreddits died this year*

/r/reddit.com went down in a Rasputin-like fashion, coming back to life near the end of 2011 to have yet more posts submitted to it, then finally clunked over the head and put to rest. RIP.

**2012 - The Year Picture Subreddits Took Over**

Finally, here we are in 2012.

[2012 - The Year Picture Subreddits Took Over](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-2012.png)

Apparently Redditors got tired of the rage comics in 2012, as shown by the declining activity in /r/f7u12. The Pokemon craze hit Reddit big time in 2012, with /r/pokemon finally making it into the top 25 active subreddits. The most interesting thing to me, though, is how /r/trees remained remarkably active despite the fact that it's not a default subreddit. Reddit has some seriously dedicated tokers!

/r/politics experienced a small resurgence of activity near November for the 2012 Presidential elections, but it was nothing compared to last time. If anything, this fact shows how much Reddit has changed in the past four years: from politically active tech nerds to gamers, stoners, and picture/meme lovers.

Finally, we saw two more subreddit spikes due to game releases this year: /r/Diablo for Diablo 3's mid-May release, and /r/guildwars2 for its late August release.

*Notable subreddits born this year*

/r/ModerationLog was created to log all of the submissions that were removed by moderators of Reddit's various subreddits. There seems to be quite a lot of moderation going on nowadays!

/r/POLITIC's post bot has excelled at bringing content into this subreddit, made obvious by the sudden explosion of /r/POLITIC's posts in late 2012 (not shown here). It's pretty rare for a new subreddit to make a dent in Reddit's overall submission traffic nowadays, so hats off to the /r/POLITIC bot!

*Notable subreddits died this year*

While a few subreddits seem to have fallen from the charts this year (/r/firstworldproblems, /r/IAmA, /r/worldnews), they're still alive and well. Only time will tell if text posts and article links will be completely replaced by images and videos.

**One last word on the future of Reddit**

I have one last comment on the future of Reddit. I've seen a lot of people getting disparaged by how Reddit is slowly becoming a sophisticated image board, and I'd like to address that concern here. Let's recall the subreddit diversity graph I showed earlier:

[Subreddit diversity over time](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/UniqueSubredditsSubmittedToOverTime.png)

What's readily apparent from this graph is that even though the picture subreddits are dominating Reddit in terms of pure number of submissions, there are new subreddits dedicated to every topic you can imagine being created every day. Yet the biggest hurdle Redditors face is finding these new subreddits that are interesting to them. Oftentimes a new subreddit springs into popularity because of a chance mention in the comments of a picture submission, but that's not really an efficient way of guiding Redditors to the subreddits that they find interesting. As such, I think Reddit needs a new tool -- or set of tools -- to help new Redditors find smaller subreddits that interest them.

What should that new tool be?",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_1a7aoj,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1a7aoj/retracing_the_evolution_of_reddit_through_post/,

However, some bots are disruptive and controversial (like the much-discussed libertyequalizer bot here on reddit). Other bots fall somewhere in between (like the VLB discussed elsewhere in ToR: http://redd.it/17vrq2). 

I'm wondering if there is a typology of reddit bots. By typology, I mean a more or less formal characterization schema for bots based on (for example) the work they do, how they do it, what they take as input/what they produce as output, etc. 

I'm aware of a few bots (aggregation bots like VLB, notification bots like the SRS trackers, etc), but I don't spend as much time in as many places on reddit as I would like and know I am missing out on a lot. I'd be interested in knowing what other people think. What bots are you aware of? What kind of work do they do? Are they good or bad? Is that even the right question to ask?

[Here's a post](http://redd.it/q9rmd) from back when I was the mod, that gives some insight into the form and substance of the rule. [Here's another](http://redd.it/p9c0m) that explains my general position on what ToR can and can't achieve.

The part people *really* didn't like was the bit excluding suggestions of how the admins could change the site. People like talking about that stuff. I wanted it out of ToR for two reasons. One is that there's already a place for talking about admin-level chances: /r\/IdeasForTheAdmins. The other is that idle speculation about how things *could* be different (if only people would change the very nature of the site on our behalf) was starting to drown out discussion about how we could empower ourselves and make changes as users and moderators.

Since I stopped modding ToR, I've given some more thought to these issues, and I think I've come up with a compromise. I've suggested it to the current mods, but I think they'd like your input before they settle one way or the other. What I've suggested is replacing the current rule about admin-level suggestions with this one:

&gt; Suggestions that have been made to /r/IdeasForTheAdmins may be resubmitted to TheoryOfReddit by the original author after 7 days, provided that the new submission includes a link to the original thread and a prompt for further discussion. All other submissions concerning changes that could be implemented only by the admins will be removed by the moderators.

That leaves open the possibility of discussing admin-level changes in ToR, but keeps ToR from being a substitute for discussing those changes in IftA, where they're more likely to receive admin consideration. The extra step would also likely keep admin-level suggestions from pushing out other, more constructive ToR topics.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_wo7on,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/wo7on/hi_i_wrote_the_substance_of_tors_second_rule_a/,

I was just browsing the frontpage and stumbled upon [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/u4hhh/reddit_what_is_the_most_powerful_image_you_have/) question in /r/Askreddit. Needless to say, its a pretty cool topic so I expanded the thread.  

The first few top posts were pretty typical, including [this photo from Mars](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0901/PIA07997_spiritmars.jpg), [and this photo from a solider's funeral](http://i.imgur.com/Bd010.jpg). The next few, however, get a little weird. I have screenshotted them along with some of the comments for context as well as provided the actual imgur links to the images. It seems that the links to certain photos in the thread are not what the posters are claiming them to be. So either this is some huge raid (given how many upvotes they have) or someone is getting hacked. Either way, here are my examples: 

[Here's the first one.](http://i.imgur.com/9BjZH.jpg) From what I can determine, it is supposed to be a photo of a man burning from the gulf war. Instead it is a photo of an uncooked slab of meat.

[Direct imgur link](http://i.imgur.com/cG2NM.jpg)

[Here's the second one.](http://i.imgur.com/Dvnz7.jpg) The poster says it's a photo of a dog and the comments reciprocate this, but instead it's some poor photoshop of a diner with random stuff added in.

[Direct imgur link](http://i.imgur.com/l8nQB.jpg)

--

[Here's the third one.](http://i.imgur.com/eZPxi.jpg) The poster calls it ""tank man"" which is probably a reference to [this photo](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d8/Tianasquare.jpg/300px-Tianasquare.jpg). But, instead it's a photo of a purple sports car.

[Direct imgur link](http://i.imgur.com/kE8n6.jpg)

There might be more, but those are the only ones I have found near the top so far.

Any ideas as to what might be going on here?

Has reddit/imgur been raided or hacked? 

Any information people can bring forward would be awesome.

I've recently come across an interesting [article](http://allthingsd.com/20120412/meet-9gag-the-community-comedy-site-thats-growing-like-crazy/) regarding the growth of 9gag. The co-founder of 9gag has reported that their site gets 67 million unique visitors and 2 billion page views. Assuming that's the April report, I guesstimate that reddit pulls around 48.1 million unique visitors on the same month. I got this estimate by correlating between the data from [here](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/how-reddit-works.html) and [here](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/2-billion-beyond.html). Regardless of whether the stats are accurate, it's obvious that 9gag is a competitor to reddit; whether we like it or not.

With the fall of digg during their v4 debut, 9gag seemed to have filled the vacuum. Prior to digg v4, digg power users were ~~stealing~~ reposting reddit content that would reach digg's frontpage within 24 hours. 9gag is doing the same, but at a faster rate, and adding their watermark. The 9gag watermark may have contributed to 9gag's growth when content gets reshared to other sites (i.e Facebook). There isn't anything we can do since watermarks, or uploading original content to imgur (like [/r/comics](/r/comics)) is frowned upon here at reddit.

Another argument some of you may point out is that reddit and 9gag clearly focus on two different niches. 9gag focuses on sharing of images (memes or not), and this type of content is a subset of the content you can find on reddit. However with the current state that the popular subreddits are going towards (like converting videos to image-like comics), it's obvious that the guest frontpage of reddit is filled with qkme.me and imgur.com links. I myself do not subscribe to popular subreddits such as [/r/pics](/r/pics) or [/r/funny](/r/funny), so I don't receive this type of junk content. 

In addition, to convert an entirely new user (i.e lurkers) to a reddit user, there doesn't seem to be a site tour like what [digg](http://about.digg.com/tour) has (nor one of those nifty javascript tours) to introduce the concept of the subreddit. The reddit [help](http://www.reddit.com/help) section doesn't really count especially for people with a really short attention-span. =] 

Are the reddit staff considering these issues? I hope they have a roadmap for reddit in the longrun. What do you guys think about this?

I decided I wanted to test if this was true, so I decided to investigate.  After a little research, I learned a little about the reddit api, most importantly not to make a request more than once every two seconds and that any url can be appended with '.json' to get the page as a big JSON string.

**What I Looked For**

I am not a statistician, but I decided comparing the number of subreddits active users of a subreddit visited and compare them.  I decided the easiest way to determine active users was to scan the comments of every post on the front page and see how many subreddits each of those commenters had commented on recently (on that user's front page).  I take all the subreddit commenters I find, look for the first quartile, median, and third quartile number of subreddits each user had on their overview page.

After I wrote my script to do that, I decided to run the same test on frontpage posters for all the subreddits.

**The Code**

As I said, I wrote it in Groovy, partly because I wanted to give Groovy a try and partly because Groovy has really nice built-in support for JSON.  The code is a giant mess because I was feeling lazy, experimental, and like I would only run this program once or twice.  There are 4 files, the main script:

http://pastebin.com/UBzdCAsh

And three class files:

http://pastebin.com/fbzcMukn

http://pastebin.com/XHPfUNWM

http://pastebin.com/pNkuwDWe

You'll notice that in the User class, the http request is wrapped in a try/catch.  That's because I would get 404 pages for certain users.  I asked around here a couple weeks ago, and someone pointed out that these are shadow bans.  You'll also notice that my first quartile, median, and mode calculations are a little sloppy.

To make the script check only the posters, change line 58 of the first file to read as follows: 
        subreddits.add(new SubredditPosts(it))

I don't know why Libre Office decided to reverse the order of the rows for the charts.  Sorry.  The top of the list is the default subreddits and the bottom is a few others I;ve chosen.

**Some Analysis**

My original question was whether or not the users of r/starcraft participate in fewer subreddits than 'normal' users.  The short answer is yes.  Users of r/starcraft participate in other subreddits less than other users.  This is true for posters and commenters.

Interestingly, posters tend to participate in fewer subreddits than commenters, indicated by the numbers for posters generally being quite a bit lower across the board.  25% or more posters in IAmA only have comments in that subreddit, likely due to the high number of throwaways used there for posting.  The commenters' numbers for IAmA aren't abnormal.

I wanted to know if a more general ranking model could be made from just the composition of the comments section on the post. The 3 models I thought of were:

1. Number of comments, NC.

2.  Number of users who leave a single comment on the post. People who comment ""LOL CATZ!!!"" on posts or just leave their opinion and not follow up, SC.

3.  Number of users who return to post more than one comment. They would mostly be having a conversation on the topic of the post, which is good, MC.

The models had Low correlation with reddit ranking on the mixed dataset. It could be explained by the fact that different communities have different sizes and voting and commenting behaviors. 

Overall, NC had high correlation with the reddit score (log(net-votes)).

Whether you are talking about /r/bestof, /r/DepthHub, /r/SubredditDrama, /r/ShitRedditSays, /r/Circlebroke, /r/MetaHub, or any of the dozens of subreddits that are more or less devoted to linking to other subreddits, for better or for worse, they do have a noticeable effect on whatever thread they feature. Often this can cause users reading the thread to get a false impression of how the community usually behaves. For example, if /r/ShitRedditSays and /r/MensRights both link to the same thread, more often than not it will be a total flame war, even if the subreddit in question is /r/PolitenessBrigade.

As a moderator of /r/bestof, I often hear moderators of smaller subreddits complain about the effect that /r/bestof has on their subreddit. While I certainly sympathize, especially since I've been on the other end of that situation many times, I feel that /r/bestof benefits reddit as a whole in the long run, bringing more exposure to smaller subreddits, spreading out the userbase &amp; educating them in the process. While it may have a positive effect overall in the long run, I certainly agree that it can cause an acute negative effect in the short term, and moderators need to stay diligent when their subreddit is linked to by a meta subreddit.

I have an idea for a bot that would help with this, but I have absolutely no coding experience myself, so I was hoping that one of our subscribers would be willing to put forth the effort to help make this a reality. I wish there was a bot that would monitor *all* of the meta subreddits, and message the moderators of any subreddit that gets linked. That way mods would know right away when their subreddit might be experiencing some increased exposure and traffic, and be prepared.

I particularly want to hear from the moderators of smaller subreddits on this one. Would you like to be notified via modmail when subreddits like /r/bestof, /r/SubredditDrama &amp; /r/ShitRedditSays link to your subreddit?

3. Which force below do you think is greater, community moderation, or eternal september? Is there a non-moderator way of balancing the forces.  

**From the moderator.** 

&gt;Downvotes and constructive replies reinforce the desirable social norm much more because
&gt;1. it is not a faceless mod who removes the comment, especially if the offending person doesn't notice the removal
&gt;2. the downvotes and the comments show that the community cares. If I remove the joke, somebody else will wonder why it isn't there and make the same.
&gt;3. in general, removal also removes the place for education. The subreddit will decline much faster because new members don't learn about the social norms. They just disappear until the mods cannot stem the tide anymore.

**From the OP's post**

&gt;September that never ended: One of the seasonal rhythms of the Usenet used to be the annual September influx of clueless newbies who, lacking any sense of netiquette, made a general nuisance of themselves. This coincided with people starting college, getting their first internet accounts, and plunging in without bothering to learn what was acceptable. These relatively small drafts of newbies could be assimilated within a few months. But in September 1993, AOL users became able to post to Usenet, nearly overwhelming the old-timers' capacity to acculturate them; to those who nostalgically recall the period before, this triggered an inexorable decline in the quality of discussions on newsgroups. Syn. eternal September

Obviously any cogent attempt at doing this would require some safeguards be put in place and heavy-handed modding of information. Due to the nature of the subject matter I don't know how something like this could be created without a certain amount of personal information being shared. Therefore, here's what I've been leaning towards for rules so far:

- No personal information &lt; 20 years old (unless deceased)

- No Social Security Numbers... ever

- No ""finders fees"". Anyone seeking to reunite an item with a family may be reimbursed for shipping of items but no other monetary compensation is permitted

As rage comics become increasingly popular, it seems as if we are seeing the evolution of a hieroglyphic language made up of rage faces. What I mean is, as the use grows, it is easy to observe newer faces that once had a specific meaning get morphed and formed to contain new meanings, i.e. Me Gusta used to mean liking something that you shouldn't, now it has devolved into a more general ""I like this"". The ""Fuck that bitch"" face now simply means ""fuck that"". It seems like the trend is to start with a specific and more complicated definition and move to a more malleable one that can be used in more situations.

The most commonly used and original rage faces seem to be more static, seeing as the rage face itself has and probably will only ever have one meaning (like the most common and original terms in any language, the original Rage face is basically the ""to be"" of f7u12-ese).

I'm no linguist, but it interests me when the new faces get changed to mean something new.  It feels a bit like watching hieroglyphics be made in a few years.

My current opinion is that it isn't an outright exploitation although I dislike seeing blatant branding and product placement from companies who already advertise in various other forms of media.

I wrote [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9r1u/can_someone_please_tell_me_what_the_purpose_of_an/), for example, after the Woody Harrelson IAMA and some others where everyone downvoted OP:

&gt;Woody Harrellson's AMA sucked. His answers were terrible. But the answer to that problem is to downvote the fucking thread, not his individual answers. Everything he has said is hidden. It is entirely pointless.

&gt;Any time there's a controversial topic, people do the exact opposite of what they should; they upvote the thread, because it looks interesting, and then they downvote the answers because they don't like what they hear. Well guess what, if the topic is called, ""IAmA a member of the KKK AMA,"" the OP's answers are probably going to be racist. Why the hell would you downvote? What did you expect? The sole purpose of an AMA is to hear what the OP has to say, and if the OP's answers are controversial or go against the hivemind, it's even better! It allows for some fresh discussion in an environment where opinion is often frighteningly homogeneous. Do you guys not realize why it's fucking retarded to downvote the OP in an AMA?
I will buy someone Reddit gold if they can give me one single valid reason for why an AMA thread should exist if not to read the OP's answers. Again, if you don't think it's a good topic, then downvote the fucking thread. There is literally zero point to an AMA in which the OP's answers are hidden. It's like reading the wrong half of an interview transcript.

So I just discovered this subreddit, and it seems like a perfect place to post this question. Should downvoting even be enabled at all for OP in /r/IAmA? As I said in that post, going into some AMAs is like reading the wrong half of an interview transcript. It just doesn't make sense. 

In summary:

1. The only reason for an AMA thread is to hear the views of the OP. If OP's posts are hidden and buried at the bottom, what is the point of the thread?
2. Why would someone click the thread if they didn't want to hear OP's views?

Should moderators be involved in deleting threads that become ""circlejerks""?",goodbetterbestbested,99,45,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/sep6q/what_is_a_circlejerk_should_moderators_be/,"What is a circlejerk? It's a term casually thrown around on reddit these days. We have large communities devoted exclusively to circlejerking. It has even, as of late, [been used as a justification for heavy-handed moderation](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/s88w5/raskreddit_moderators_are_deleting_threads_that/c4bwkbk). But unlike other kinds of undesirable behavior on reddit that are objectively identifiable (posting someone's personal information, for example), circlejerking is not so easy to pin down. Like obscenity or pornography, it is resistant to strict definition, yet everyone thinks that they know it when they see it.

Regardless, I will venture an attempt. I think we all know what the term means outside the web context. In the figurative web context, circlejerks are groups of people agreeing with each other with an air of self-congratulation. In a circlejerk, the participants express their views not so much because they believe in them (although they very well may), but because they like having their egos stroked. The danger of a circlejerk is the same as the danger of groupthink: that minority viewpoints will be shut out and erroneous views and courses of action will be adopted without a critical eye.

When I see a reddit post titled, ""Does anyone else like bacon?"" or ""Who else thinks pot should be legalized?"" or ""My Republican dad destroyed my copy of Cosmos because he found out I am gay,"" I can confidently predict what the top comments in those threads will be like. With topics like these, I can even predict that one of the top comments will be a complaint that the whole thread should be moved to /r/circlejerk or something along those lines.

The reason I am able to predict what the top comments will be like is that the reddit community has coalesced around a viewpoint on those topics. But what is the difference between community consensus and circlejerking? As far as I can tell, the difference between the two lies mostly within the eye of the beholder. Whether you are going to get upvoted for belittling others by using the term depends on what community you are posting in. In /r/libertarian you will get upvoted for calling /r/progressive a circlejerk. In /r/obama you will get upvoted for calling /r/RonPaul a circlejerk.

It's as if the people who use the term circlejerk are unable to believe that a group of people would legitimately disagree with them, so they assume the other group is actually doing it just to stroke each other's egos. Any time a group of people agrees with one another, it is a circlejerk or ""groupthink,"" rather than a legitimate and inevitable result of having a community. 

I'm not saying that groupthink is not something to be scrutinized. I am saying that charges of circlejerking and groupthink have really gotten out of hand on reddit lately. And the adoption of the wildly subjective term ""circlejerking"" as a reason to delete threads and content is a smokescreen for moderators to get rid of content they don't like. A really good example is andrewsmith1986 allowing the fake suicide thread in AskReddit to stay up, but [deleting the threads in the same subreddit that exposed it as fake](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/s88w5/raskreddit_moderators_are_deleting_threads_that/c4bwkbk), nominally because he thought the latter thread was a ""circlejerk"" (even though the former was *far* more self-congratulatory and full of indignation)— but really because he has an axe to grind against SRS.

TL;DR: Reddit, as a community, certainly does have consensus viewpoints, and consensus viewpoints certainly have inherent dangers. But the other side of the coin is that not all community consensus is groupthink. To call a community of belief a ""circlejerk"" merely because it does not match your own viewpoint is kind of idiotic. To delete content on a default subreddit based on your own idea of what a circlejerk is or is not is downright arbitrary censorship. Particularly ironic is the idea that a moderator ""interrupting the circlejerk"" promotes a diversity of opinion, when in fact it is merely the moderator excluding opinions s/he does not share.",,False,,t5_2rtff,True,,,True,t3_sep6q,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/sep6q/what_is_a_circlejerk_should_moderators_be/,

Many posts attract comments such as ""[the post in question] was inevitable,"" and usually, we agree: it's no surprise that people in r/f7u12 complain about content, or that there are trolls in r/atheism, and so on.

So if our hindsight is so clear, why not sharpen our foresight? Could we make predictions about the future of Reddit? Why not? (Of course, the easiest predictions are going to be those of the least value, simply because they are so trivial. But one must start somewhere.)

A key aspect of this is that predictions are built on reason, and this reason is founded in the aspect that while individual Redditors cannot typically be predicted easily, Reddit as a whole always has people of certain groups and who act in certain ways. And it is this collective action that predictions and hindsight observations are based upon.

So, while it might not be possible to predict the next specific trend in fashion, that there will be a next trend is known, and perhaps with enough information one could make an appropriate educated guess. And similarly with Reddit, we can achieve a nontrivial prediction with relevant information.

This concept has been touched on before by Isaac Asimov in his *Foundation* series, in which the statistical prediction of a large number of humans is called [psychohistory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_%28fictional%29). It operates under two assumptions: that the accuracy of a prediction of a population is proportional to its size (so a group of 10 people might be hard to predict, but a group of ten million is easier), and that in order for the predictions to be successful, the population cannot know about them (as that would of course change their actions).

Of course, Asimov develops it in a massive, aging galactic empire with a population of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 people, and even then his protagonist struggles to discover the massively complicated equations governing the statistics of human collective behavior. But then the protagonist can make incredibly accurate predictions, calling the specific dates and times and reasons of wars and their resolutions hundreds of years before they happen.

In ToR, we won't be that successful, of course; Reddit's users ""only"" number in the millions, and so our predictions will be less amazing. But it should still be possible to make predictions that are one step beyond obvious, and that would be really cool. It may be possible to take the leap from observing Reddit to beginning to look into its future.

What do you think about this? Am I overthinking this or overestimating powers of prediction? Are simple predictions possible? And do you have any interesting ones?

TL;DR: The other day I realized that Asimov's psychohistory dovetails nicely with r/ToR, and that we might be able to go from mere hindsight and discussion of observation to using knowledge about Reddit to predict interesting generalities about its future.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_rzigi,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/rzigi/psychohistory/,

So I've been playing catch-up today. One discussion I missed the first go round was [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/jpmsu/why_shouldnt_self_posts_generate_karma/). One top-level exchange went:

&gt; **N8theGr8**: They used to generate karma, but the front page was flooded with useless, pointless, karma whoring self-posts, so the admins removed the ability for them to generate karma.

&gt; **ymersvennson**: What would that be, for example. And why wouldn't people make the exact same thing with an imgur post now?

For examples, you can take a look at [this](http://reddit.com/info/p5lb/comments) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6xg1u/vote_up_if_you_know_how_many_houses_you_own/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/69umk/vote_up_if_you_dont_give_a_flying_fuck_about_the/), some of the most successful of the genre. And when you see these posts getting a score of 3000+, bear in mind that this was in 2008, when Reddit's user population was a fraction of what it is now.

Of course, two points can be made right off the bat. One: vote-begging is against reddiquette, so a stronger communal observance of reddiquette could, at least theoretically, obviate the need for a change in how submissions are scored. And two: people still post that sort of thing, even though self.posts no longer award karma.

Both of which are true, but that doesn't mean that changing the way posts are scored had no effect. ""Vote up if"" posts were the reason the vote-begging rule was added to the reddiquette, but that alone wasn't enough to curb the behavior. So long as there was a karma incentive for vote-begging, people continued to do it -- so much so that the front page was quickly infested with ""Vote up if"" posts.

As far as I can tell from looking back at the Internet Wayback Machine, all of this happened quickly, almost entirely in the summer of 2008. Almost immediately after self.posts were introduced, karmawhoring went rampant, and the admins [jumped in](http://www.reddit.com/comments/6p5ef/sorry_karmawhores_no_more_karma_for_selfposts/) to stem the tide. (It would help flesh out that time line if someone could tell me exactly when self.posts were first implemented on Reddit.)

As for the second point (that people still post the equivalent of ""vote up if"" self.posts), while that's demonstrably true, the change *did* have an impact on Reddit's overall posting and voting patterns. For one thing, it pushed those submissions into their own reddits.

Consider, for example, [/r/DoesAnybodyElse](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse). The basic format for submissions in that reddit is equivalent to ""vote up if""-style self.posts. So long as self.posts received karma, there was very little incentive for posting to a reddit like /r/DAE. If your goal was to get as much karma as possible, why would you post to a reddit with 90,000 viewers, rather than, say, /r/politics, which has more than 7 times that many? Any since the incentive was so heavily on posting to the biggest possible reddit, how would a fledgling reddit like /r/DAE even get off the ground in the first place? The answers are, you wouldn't, and it wouldn't, respectively.

Take away the karma incentive, though, and it suddenly becomes much easier to restrict that sort of submission to its own subreddit. In part, that's because, with the karma incentive gone, the karmawhores quickly abandon that format. Other motives take over. One such motive is that of appealing to the *best* (as in, most specialized) audience for a particular submissions, not just the biggest possible. People with legitimate questions will tend to take them to the reddit they think is most likely to give them a good answer. That makes it possible for reddits like /r/AskScience to build the momentum necessary to become really good at what they do.

Which does not mean, of course, that we've entirely done away with ""vote up if""-style posts. The form has changed to be less recognizable. We've grown more sophisticated in that regard, making our posts more difficult to pin to reddiquette, even as the reddiquette grows more extensive and more difficult to bear in mind. These days, you're more likely to see ""vote up if""-style submissions take the form of a link to an image of a favorite childhood television show or book, with a title like ""No, this is the best *x* of all time.""

The form has changed, but the incentive and motive remain largely the same.

The applicable reddiquette is easy enough to update, particularly since anyone can edit that. And anyone does, apparently, but it seems to me that there's a fair amount of what you might call ""in principle"" redundancy in the reddiquette, with the potential for much, much more. To the policy against ""pleading for votes,"" we could add something that also covers ""No, this""-style submissions, but doing so only adds to the burden imposed by reddiquette, and makes new redditors even more likely to ignore reddiquette as a whole. Better, I think, to stress the principle that underlies both policies, and that means doing a better job of communicating *why* they're frowned upon. Which, in turn, means communicating a better sense of what it is Reddit's supposed to do in the first place.

(While we're at it, I'm going to trot out my usual dead horse and point out that, however quick the admins may have been to put the ixnay on self.post karmawhoring, the same basic behavior has been tolerated with regard to image links for so long that the practice has become thoroughly entrenched in the culture of the Reddit community. /deadhorse)",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_jyc9x,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/jyc9x/a_little_reddit_history_for_the_theorists/,

**Preface**

*Welcome to our weekly ""Admin-Level Change"" thought experiment. Each week, an individual /r/TheoryOfReddit moderator will host a discussion about a theoretical changes to reddit's code, infrastructure or official policy that would not be possible for users and moderators to accomplish alone; it would require admin intervention.*

Here is this week's topic:

## How could reddit change the way moderation teams are structured, especially in large subreddits?

**Discussion**

Mod hierarchy and unilateral subreddit control comes up most frequently when discussing the defaults.  However, given size and time, it could be applied to many other large communities where top moderators aren't very active. This has always been a difficult conversation and has been the source of many arguments.

Without hierarchy, a sense of leadership and stability is gone.  With legacy mods that do no work, it's easy to make an argument that they are unfairly squatting on their position and can undo months, if not years of work with a few clicks to demod those who have been taking care of the subreddit on a day to day basis. 

* When would it acceptable to rearrange the structure of a mod team?

* What metrics could be used to support the removal of a top moderator?

* Is there any way to employ this without completely stripping 'creator's rights' that the reddit community typically celebrates?

* Could the role of moderator function entirely without hierarchy?

* Could these rules be applied to all reddit communities, or only the defaults? 

* Is there any way to formalize these decisions in such a way that it could be applied fairly to any subreddit, regardless of size? Or, to ask it a slightly different way - is there any way to have these decisions remain within the community and not have to involve the administrators in making/approving dramatic removals of legacy moderators?

I noticed looking at the graph that the peak of users tends to be from 6pm greenwhich time to 6 am greenwhich time. The time i would expect a redditor to use reddit is between noon and midnight, so that correlates with eastern standard time give or take, with the drop down periods begin the gradual amounts dropping off from different timezones.

I have a question though, for redditors not in eastern standard time, do you sometimes go on reddit at different times to get all the content the eastern standard timers give? How does the global reach of reddit affect people?

A part of the quality issue isn't low quality posters it's high quality experts who don't wish to/don't consider/are too frustrated to share their knowledge. In addressing this issue we may increase the overall quality of reddit sitewide through personal actions and accountability without any controversial appeals to morals, ethics, or beliefs.**



**Assumptions:**

- Reddit sees itself as an (mostly) intellectual meeting ground filled with (mostly) progressive people.

- Individual user's interactions often quickly shift from positive discussion to dead end argument, seemingly with little need for major catalyst. This tendency stifles free flow of information due to a mutual diversion of attention from discussion to defense (from debate to drama for unrelated 3rd parties).

- Most redditors (people) would (like to) consider themselves rational.


**Observed Behaviors:**
*Note: Originally this section contained examples, however in the interest of avoiding any chance of bandwagoning, brigading, or the encouragement of drama I will leave finding direct examples of these observations as an exercise to the reader. Most of these examples can be found on the front page on a daily basis, and some even can be found in otherwise well moderated threads.*

***Allowing lack of clarification to spiral immediately into argument rather than seeking an understanding of idea presented. Example:***

&gt; **ActuallyBelievesinSouthernHeritage (ABSH)**: ""Well i believe the Confederate flag is a symbol of heritage not racism""

&gt; **SouthernMinorityWithNegativeExperiences:** ""You're racist""

* In this example we see two people who have an opportunity at a real discussion on race miss a golden opportunity to immediate assumption of hostility. While someone with the goal of learning or conversation would seemingly rationally wish to pursue the ""Why would you think that symbol was anything other than of hate?"" a personal investment in the matter leads to an understandable emotional response. 

* Despite the fact that ABSH *actually believes in southern heritage* and might change his opinion on the perception of the confederate flag given an understanding of a different viewpoint, the possibility is lost and nothing of value is gained. This example is not necessarily hypothetical, search through my post history and you'll find many examples of a redditor who wishes to understand the human condition casually discarding series of golden opportunities through emotional responses to personal topics.

***Assumption of mental superiority in a way that is not logically consistent.***

&gt; **DoesnotUnderstandConcept:** I don't understand this concept

&gt; **ThinksConceptIsBasic:** If you can't handle this task then maybe this isn't the field for you

&gt; **ThinksOPIsUninitiated:** You know, most people here already understand basic concept, if you can't figure it out you might need to get out (note: This does not mean specialist spaces can't exist, this is to note that many of these responses make no effort to point the user to more amateur friendly communities, beginner materials, or a tip on a starting point).

&gt; **ThinksConceptIsAdvanced:** This concept is really too advanced for you if you, just don't bother. (Note: Concepts *can* be advanced, but a productive ending would be a direction towards building the basic skills necessary for the advanced project, not a dead end.)

&gt; **ThinksPosterIsGenerallyPoor:** Why would a guy like *you* want to know concept, I've seen your history you obviously aren't interested in concept. (particularly self defeating as is often seen when a user who espouses a controversial view seeks information on the opposing side of that view, even in neutral spaces)

* There are many examples, but in each of the examples there is the assumption of some sort of superiority, often of a mental nature. The question then, is twofold:

1. Empathetic Appeal: If a user is so advanced, what does he stand to gain from not sharing his knowledge? Why not choose to abstain from comment or assist in another user's efforts to make a productive change (in this instance learning) rather than making a generally valueless dead end negative comment (you're dumb doesn't help anyone).
2. Narcissicstic Appeal: If the user is so intelligent why can he not figure out a method to explain the information so as to inform those he feels is ""lesser""? While not everyone wishes to learn, there is a great enough volume of users with interests and experts with knowledge that posting in an effort only to chastise with no option for improvement is an exercise in the waste of any expert's time.

***Assumptions based on affiliation***

* This section essentially writes itself. Examples abound in the wild and can be seen unfortunately often when two groups on opposite sides of an issue meet in either space, or many times in supposedly neutral spaces. 

*The problem with assumption by affiliation is it is a simple way to free users the effort of classification by presentation of ideas. While not all users of opposing groups assume by affiliation the trend is common enough to see the following exchange on a regular basis:

&gt; **ControversialGroupMemberHasInformation:** I have [information] with [source]

&gt; **OpposingGroupMember:** I have information that you are a member of our enemy, therefore your source is invalid as is your information. The ramifications on overall quality (does anyone feel infighting is high quality?) of this kind of exchange are obvious, yet it is often seen as a sort of given in many default subs and even some semi-moderated areas.

**Wrap-up/Conclusions**

These are only a few of the observations i've noted compiled in the interest of time and readability. This is a hypothesis, so i may have overlooked critical components and i welcome readers to point out facts i may have overlooked. I ask the reader to accept that the article as a whole is not intended as an attack on any group or individual, but a reflection on reddit as a whole based on a reflection of my own personal posting habits and their negative effect on my overall goals for reddit/the reddit experience.

**Discussion Questions:**

1. Do you feel Reddit is/displays/proclaims intelligence/progressivness. For either response, Why?

2. Do you feel you have experienced an instance where an argument was had where an exchange of information could have occurred with patience and mutual understanding?

3. Do you consider yourself intellectual/nerdy/academic/smart/clever/quickwitted. 

3a. If yes, does this make you resent ""stupid"" posters

3b. Do you feel you've had an instance where you were condescending where you could have been educational?

3c. Do you sometimes/often/rarely feel that you *do* present information, but the information is poorly received/ignored/misunderstood? If so, has this made you less likely to attempt an educational response? Has it made you more likely to respond in a hostile tone to those who may struggle for understanding?

*Set 2 until i figure out how to format lists properly*

4. If you have posted a question, how do you feel your experience has been? Can you remember specific positive instances? Negative? What would you say the ratio to educational vs hostile would be in terms of responses to requests for information. If positive, have you noticed others receiving negative response? 

5. Do you feel that there is anything you can do to increase the level of discourse as relates to this topic/idea/hypothesis. Do you feel this is a valid hypothesis, or does it miss a critical component.

6. Are there any observations on some of the negative interactions between question seekers and possible experts you would like to add? The positive?

7. [meta] Did you find this thread readable? If not, which section, and what would you change?

But it seemed the closest to what I want to say, so I'll put it here. 

Reddit used to be kind of like a science fiction convention - lots of rooms and panels with all kinds of different topics, generally sloppy, folks forming knots of discussion, and people wandering the halls talking. This was because there was /r/reddit, mods weren't really gods, nobody paid much attention to ""being on-topic,"" and most subreddits really didn't have refined sets of rules. 

Reddit has become, I don't know - a class building at a university, where each room has a strictly defined topic, and nobody hangs around if they're not in a room. 

I ran across this article:  
http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/12/19/143960631/second-neti-pot-death-from-amoeba-prompts-tap-water-warning

It's interesting because House recently did this as a storyline, and I thought it was complete bullshit, since US tapwater is so heavily chlorinated. Yet here we go - folks killed by it. 

This is kind of worth posting as ""interesting"" as well as something it wouldn't be a bad idea for people to see. 

Where to post it? 

/r/science only wants ""peer-reviewed science""; so they have apparently given up on hearing about interesting new things. 

/r/WTF gets weird if they don't feel things are ""WTFy enough""

/r/worldnews? Well it's kinda not really news, is it? 

And of course there's no default reddit to throw it into.

Here's the thing - when reddit was governed by the community, it was fun to throw things to the wolves and see what survived. But now that most subreddits have tin-plated dictators with delusions of godhood who give every link the up or down sign, it's not fun any more. 

I like to see what links the crowd likes - not whether or not I can guess what the mod is thinking. 

Reddit needs to lighten up. I can accept that a few places can use the heavy moderation (/r/askscience, maybe some of the default subs). But go look at /r/askscience right now - 361 comments in the first link, ten in the second, and it's single digits down from there. 

AskScience used to have amazing discussions about things. Now most of the time you're lucky if you get one or two answers. 

While I understand the intention behind heavy moderation, and as I've always said - subreddits belong to the mods - I think it may be strangling reddit. I could be wrong.

Some even accept it as truth. My position, however, is similar to blackstar9000's which is that we can't be absolutely certain about the exact reason(s) behind the increase in [fuzzed] downvotes because we simply don't have enough real data.

Now, for me to continue we're all going to have to assume the admins are telling the truth when they say the point totals are accurate though I recognize the possibility they are in fact lying. I personally feel it would be risky to the site as a business to lie about something like this, but that's just me.

With that said, let me first share the data I have gathered:

http://imgur.com/aoAb8

This is a scatter plot of the top 7525 submissions taken from the /r/all top posts of all time [list](http://www.reddit.com/r/all/top/?t=all). The oldest post is from 11/26/2006 and the most recent 10/6/2011. The y-axis shows net votes, and the x-axis is a unique id I assigned to each post and empty time point. I did it this way because it was easier to space the submissions according to the time and date they were posted. Also, you'll notice I included the ""test post"" outlier. I can assure you it did not have a noticeable affect on the trend line. 

Here's a bar chart version of the above, and without the outliers: http://imgur.com/2riRa

http://imgur.com/K17FX

This is a bar chart that shows the count of net votes rounded to the nearest 100. For example, of the 7525 posts 668 of them had a score of 1800 plus or minus 50. This is to show the distribution of point totals in the sample of data I collected.

Same chart, but broken down by year: http://imgur.com/4WgMR


General statistics of the data:

* **Average overall score:** 1843

* **Avg score in 2007:** 1956
* **Median score in 2007:** 1940

* **Avg score in 2008:** 2133
* **Median score in 2008:** 1940

* **Avg score in 2009:** 2216
* **Median score in 2009:** 1991

* **Avg score in 2010:** 1896
* **Median score in 2010:** 1822

* **Avg score in 2011:** 1721
* **Median score in 2011:** 1644

* **% of posts in 2007:** .2%
* **% of posts in 2008:** 3.6%
* **% of posts in 2009:** 10.8%
* **% of posts in 2010:** 30.3%
* **% of posts in 2011:** 55.1%

My data shows the average net votes per year is decreasing well below the bar score Gravity13 set in his previous [analysis](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/h0ymi/how_karma_actually_works/). He claimed scores were hovering around 2000, but that's only because he was drawing from the top 1000 posts in /r/all where the min net vote was around 2400. Lower scores unsurprisingly have a higher density of posts. Lower scores in recent history have even more density. It's hard to say what the actual score densities of years prior to 2009 are because the majority of the data comes from 2010 and 2011. The downward trend in my graphs are largely a result of the increasing data density over time.

Okay, so *why* are there a lot more posts with lower scores? Is it because reddit is pumping downvotes into them? Doubtful. There are a few things at play, I think:

* The rate at which the front page is refreshed has increased due to an increased number of posts in general and in submissions that require little time to consume, ie, pics/videos/memes/etc.

* Popular submissions that take little time to consume might be seen as more disposable; that is, less worthy of saving, and less worthy of voting on after it has reached the front page.

* If submissions in general are spending less time on the front page chances are they are receiving less votes overall. This adds to the reasons why the density of popular posts increases at lower scores.

* After a post reaches a certain level of visibility people are less incentivized to vote it up, but more so to vote it down.

What is your take on this data?

**Edit:**

As I was writing this my python script reached the end of the /r/all top all time list. There were at the time of mining 10,028 posts. The oldest post was the same as the data above, a single one in 2006. Here's an updated bar chart of the rounded score distribution:

The overall average post score for 10,000 popular data points is: 1586

All as the subreddit's title bar cheerfully advertises 'Quality Gaming Content and Discussion'.

The very bottom [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1agq2e/rgames_is_becoming_about_as_substantive_as_rgaming/c8x9o1q) is a suggestion that OP should just downvote the content he doesn't like in that subreddit instead of making an off-topic meta-post to complain about it.

I suppose some might say that these self-post 'sanity checks' are necessary to publicly engage with the moderators and make sure the subreddit stays on track.  In my view, however, this post (and many others like it) are just thinly-veiled 'let's celebrate ourselves' threads, and don't actually accomplish anything except a loud approval of principles which most subscribers already know and agree with.  Rather than accomplishing this on posts which at least offer some real content in the form of an external link to something, these self-posts cater directly to that instinctive preference for immediate gratification, without bothering to go to trouble of actually being about anything besides that.

The immediate gratification — the DAEs, the strong personal opinion posts, these to me are the death knell of any previously-respectable subreddit.  I will say that /r/games is still a pretty high-quality gaming subreddit, but it is definitely already on the decline.

Is there any way to stop this from happening?  Is there any way to keep users focused on the content of a subreddit, as opposed to being entirely focused on themselves in relation to that content?  There is a sharp distinction between posts that provoke good discussion and posts that are more like 'let's all get together and be mad about this.'  Defenders will say that it's just the community voicing its opinion on things, but at some point the subreddit becomes all about the opinion and hardly about the things.  The karma mechanic makes it unlikely that people will post content that is more informative than polarizing, and even less likely that users will actually see any nonpolarizing content.

In this way the bias of a subreddit continues to feed itself, until the whole thing is eventually written off as hopelessly hive-minded and, crucially, no longer about quality discussion.

I want to know if there is any way to stop this from happening.  Like if the moderators on /r/politics wanted to actively change the view that /r/politics is liberal and left-leaning.  Theoretically, could this be accomplished? ",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_1ah48j,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1ah48j/hiveminded_circlejerkingquashing_of_unpopular/,

From the data that I gathered you can tell a few things. Firstly I need more of it, you do get a reasonable idea where most of the gold comments are but only a handful of subreddits got more than one or two gold comments so it's difficult to tell which subs regularly get gold comments in them and which of them are just outliers.

Secondly the size of the subreddit only has a limited effect on how many comments got gilded. /r/music and /r/AdviceAnimals both got only one gold comments where as /r/picrequests, a subreddit with just under 12000 subscribers, got two. The small amount of data involved here could mean that it's just an anomaly but it's still telling that some of our largest subs are only getting a few gilded comments.

It's quite obvious that /r/AskReddit is where most of the gilded comments are with 82/200 (or just over 40%). I think part of the reason is because most people browsing the defaults don't read the comments, they just look at the submissions. Also the rest of the defaults aren't focused on discussion so this obviously puts them at a disadvantage. It would be interesting to see what would happen if people where allowed to give gold for submissions as well as comments.

I also think it's worth stating that certain people will be better able to give Reddit gold more easily than others. For example, young people are less likely to have a credit card than adults so subreddits that tends to attract a younger audience will get less gilded comments regardless of the worth of those comments. Likewise, its reasonable to assume that a subreddit that attracts an audience with a lower than average income will also get less gilded comments.

It's worth noting that there are no porn subreddits in this list, this could simply be because there are less of them but I find it telling that /r/bdsm and /r/NoFap both managed to get gilded comments. I think the reason for this is because these two subreddits have a focus on discussion where as porn subreddits tend to be more context focused. As I said earlier it would be interesting to see what would happen if people had the ability to gild submissions as well as comments.


Finally I wish to point out that these statistics can be misleading, for example, the comments linked to in /r/bestof regularly get given reddit gold but these appear in the linked subreddit and not /r/bestof.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_16frpi,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/16frpi/gilded_comment_data/,

Different waves, same ocean.

Links with titles longer than a single word would be removed.

I came up with the idea while trying to think of ways to curb sensationalized and politicized titles. It seems to me that, by limiting titles to one word, you'd tamp a lot of that down, while still allowing users to choose a descriptor for the content. Even if a submitter found a way to sensationalize or politicize a one-word title, their rhetoric would be more obvious to readers simply by virtue of the fact that it isn't couched in terms that might otherwise distract from it's appeal to emotion or bias.

For example, there are any number of ways to spin a headline like ""[Senate vote on jobs bill hung up on judicial fight](http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/13/10669816-senate-vote-on-jobs-bill-hung-up-on-judicial-fight),"" depending on which side you're inclined to support. But how do you encapsulate the topic and convey some part of its appeal to other redditors when you're restricted to a single word?

Moreover, that sort of rule makes it virtually impossible to present a title as an opinion *about* a subject. You can express an opinion (""ridiculous"") but only by leaving out what it's about. Or you can name a topic (""jobs"") but only in totally neutral terms. In any case, the reader actually has to click through in order to get the details. Even if you go with a topic that is almost universally associated with certain emotions (""obstructionism"") that's not enough to go on when you're voting or commenting. Readers will want to know, first of all, who's obstructing what, and if ""who"" ends up being someone they like, or ""what"" ends up being something they oppose, they might actually find themselves in favor of obstructing it.

And that may be the single most appealing aspect of this experiment: that it actually forces readers to click through to the articles if they want to know what the link is about beyond the barest generalities. Which puts them that much closer to actually reading the articles.

Of course, there are all sorts of reasons *not* to do this, but I like experimenting with weird, potentially consequential rules like this, so I thought I'd mention it. Any thoughts?",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_qv4zz,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/qv4zz/brevity/,

This is starting to seem like a concerted effort by someone, or something, to influence the way that Reddit operates.

Having been around for a while, I could not disagree more!

I think that one of the reasons for Reddit's success is the free-wheeling discussion which is relatively uncensored.

Here are some relevant ideas:

* Having one's post removed *hurts*, and discourages newbies

* Should moderators choose the feel of a subreddit, or the subscribers? 

* How do we ensure that Reddit is not censored for political purposes if moderators make a habit of removing anything they don't like?

* How can anyone make a case against a poor moderator if censorship becomes the norm?

* Do we want people self-censoring material before they post?

As you may have guessed, I am pretty much against censorship in *almost* all its forms.

Do we really want strong censorship for Reddit?

EDIT: Just to clarify, removal of posts *is* censorship, no matter what the reason.  To quote WP,

First off, is this a legitimate strategy? If you haven't been following along, /r/philosophy has had a bit of a crisis of content, with easy content dominating the top 100 list, memes, images, Calvin &amp; Hobbes, etc. There was only one mod who wasn't active, so they voted in 3 new mods. One idea was self posts only, so they gave that a two week trial. Memes are of course gone, but so are most external links. Is this a legitimate strategy for keeping the quality of a subreddit?

We all know there has traditionally been a divide between redditors who come here for a link aggregation (the majority), and those who come here for a forum (the generally more active minority). We've all seen threads continue to get upvoted even though every comment is negative, clearly because most people don't visit the comment section. If you carry out a vote like this, isn't it possible that the majority won't even visit the thread to vote? And those who do visit will all likely be pro comment by the fact that they are even there?

One must think of the pros and cons of this. I think that it'll actually help in different ways, like children being informed on current world events. It also helps that a majority of the people on Reddit type with correct punctuation, spelling, and grammar. This could help these kids with not only helping (maybe if they're from a different country), but to actually be persuaded by it, to not ""typ lik diz"" but to ""type like this"". Of course, it won't make much of a difference but it could still be helpful because no one would take you seriously if you type like the former.

And maybe it could also offer a different perspective. I mean, I'm sure that a lot of Reddit is 18+, where they're more mature than they were if they were 16-. Maybe these kids could offer something, like how they think on a certain thing (like politics). I know Reddit thinks that every kid is a douchebag who doesn't know how to spell, but *not every kid is like that.* I'm sure there are some who could offer some points in different events.

Recently, in particular, it has been popularized by a /u/libertas [comment in /r\/psychonaut](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/o1zjo/ban_memes_in_rpsychonaut/c3drsz4) that was spread widely. I've often used the term ""low-investment material"" or LIM, and may have even been responsible for the more popular variation, ""low-effort content,"" but in the recent debates over /r\/atheism's rule change I've come to the conclusion that those phrases invite more confusion than they do to clarify the problem.

Part of the problem is that ""low-effort"" sounds like an accusation. I have no doubt that some people even mean it that way. There's an ambiguity to the phrase—it could be taken to mean effort on the part of the voter (which is how I initially meant it) or effort on the part of the submitter. The latter interpretation evokes an us-versus-them mentality that tends to bring the entire discussion to an impasse. All too often, it's taken to mean that one type of content is inherently inferior to another—and, again, some people using the phrase probably even mean it that way.

Besides, effort, investment and quality^1 were never really the issue. The issue is time, and how some types of content that can be adequately assessed and voted upon in less time have a natural advantage over types that take longer to consider.

To that end, I'd suggest the following alternatives: ""quick-vote submissons"" and ""slow-vote submissions."" Those terms better encapsulate the difference that actually contributes to a structural bias, and are less easy to interpret along accusatory or elitist lines.

If those aren't fully satisfactory, though, I'm open to other suggestions. The important thing is to have a vocabulary for talking about this structural bias without predisposing others to strike a defensive posture as a matter of course.

And if you see someone making the argument and using the older terms, please link them to this page so they adjust how they talk about the problem.

Thanks.

 ^1. I'm betting some people will balk at my suggestion that quality was never really the issue, but I stand by that. The notion that image or even meme posts are of inherently lower value is completely subjective. The real issue is the structural bias which deprives much of the community of even the opportunity to assess and vote on some longer-form submissions so long as image-submissions are submitted quickly enough to move them down the new queue in less time than it's needed to read and vote on them.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_1fxgwz,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1fxgwz/lets_stop_using_the_term_loweffort_content_and/,

By interesting, I mean things like messing with the CSS to attempt to disable downvotes or hide the vote totals that articles/comments receive, or the efforts that r/askhistorians have gone to. Having a list of such efforts would be a good resource for people, both to give anecdotal evidence about the effects of certain phenomena on reddit and also give statistically-inclined people a data source to scrape. 

For example, there was a thread (http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/19ys1i/i_have_a_hypothesis_that_upvotes_attract_upvotes/) recently about the bandwagon effect where upvotes attract more upvotes. /r/communism  is a subreddit that hides vote totals*, so it would be theoretically possible to contrast the dynamics of r/communism with a subreddit (similar in size, activity, etc) that displays vote totals and look for evidence of a bandwagon effect. Of course, doing this with one subreddit isn't sufficient, hence why a list of subreddits that are doing interesting sort of things would be helpful. 

*I know there are issues with modifying the CSS since many people are using RES, looking on mobile, etc but this is just an example. 

In addition to a list of subreddits, it would be nice if we had a list of other reddit-like sites.

Over the last few months, we've seen an absolute explosion in both membership and participation in the defaults, as well as subreddits across the board. To me, one of the most interesting to watch evolve has been /r/funny. With close to three million members, and tons of posts with over 2000 net upvotes per day, this subreddit could, in some ways, foreshadow the near future for subs like /r/wtf, /r/pics, and even /r/trees. 

The most notable change that has occurred over the last year and a half (and more intensely over the last couple months) has been the shift in upvoting versus commenting. In my initial time on this site, the /r/funny boards were sort-of funny, but the comment section was always a competition for the funniest subtitle or criticism, which made the feel a lot different. Although the images and submissions were a tad more original, the comment threads were what kept me coming back for more. 

Recently, and I implore you to check, *most* of the top posts have under 50 comments. Most of these comments are blatant attempts at comment karma whoring, as they'll say banal things about the image or about the situation represented. Obviously /r/funny has not been funny in a long time, but the turnout of upvotes to comments is remarkably different than any other community I've seen on reddit.

Personally, I've found this to affect the greater reddit community very negatively, as we see once-awesome subreddits like /r/wtf falling apart and becoming another ""lol - upvote"" machine. I think one of the main drivers of this is the mass Facebook exodus to reddit, as internet sharing capabilities increase and reddit users are more compelled to advertise the community on meme pages and as high-profile accounts share obviously reddit-related material.

It seems like a subreddit needs at least 2000 subscribers to survive.  If it has less than that, its not possible for the subreddit to work as a community, since few posts will have more than 1 or 2 responses.

Quite an interesting read, I thought you gents might enjoy it as well...

&gt;Social news site Reddit is the self-proclaimed ""front page of the Internet""—a phrase increasingly hard to argue against, considering the site's unstoppable growth over the past few years. In November, Reddit staff announced that traffic had reached a stunning 1.8 billion pageviews, generated by 30 million unique visitors.

&gt;Reddit’s voting system makes it the ultimate experiment in the democratization of news and content. With a population of millions, how can an outsider possibly know who holds the most influence?

&gt;Reddit has a handy point system for quantifying contributions to the community. Called karma, it's awarded in two categories: comments and links. Karma is gained when other redditors upvote you and lost when they downvote you. The more karma you receive, the more you've ostensibly contributed to the site.

&gt;But karma doesn't represent everything on Reddit. Volunteer moderators often work in the background, ensuring the site’s tens of thousands of sections, or subreddits, run smoothly. Moderators, or mods, also make decisions about subreddit rules that can affect hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

&gt;Karma points also don’t always reflect the weight of ideas as they spread across the community—or the growing scrutiny from outsiders brought on by controversial user activity.

I have an alt where nearly every post I make is downvoted once within a couple of hours.  The posts I make are on topic, but in small subreddits where a single downvote within a couple of hours is likely to hide the post; in fact I moderate one subreddit with this account that has only one other member, and that subreddit generally looks dead, since most of my posts end up with zero karma.

Is this a common thing people do?  Is this some kind of sneaky reddit algorithm at work?  Is this the danger of posting niche material in general - someone drinking out of the all.new firehose doesn't care what subreddit a post is in?

While it is partially my fault for not showing them the basics of reddit, unsubscribing for example, and partly their fault for not trying to unsubscribe or ask how, this does bring up a valid point.

Having /r/atheism as a default reddit is the virtually same as having /r/Christianity, /r/Judaism, or /r/Islam as a default reddit.  So why does it continue to be an auto-subscribed reddit?  Is there any good reason it should be left as default?  Why don't these reasons apply to other religion's reddits?

Yet why the popularity of this particular subreddit? I argue that the number of subscribers it receives is due in part to the subreddit's name. In my experience, ""I'm going to hell for this"" is often a phrase meant for a highly inappropriate, but ambiguously humorous joke or quip. As such, it represents the alleviation of moral conscience. Posts that are instantly downvoted to oblivion in /r/funny are quite popular in /r/ImGoingToHellForThis , even though both subreddits most likely share a large portion of the same dedicated readers who will upvote/downvote and comment.

Its front page pretty much constantly has some small, uninteresting picture of a rock with the title being ""My recently deceased grandfather used to take me and my brother, who was just diagnosed with brain cancer, to this rock, until my parents got in a car crash"" (not right now, though, now it's just 80% Halloween costumes). And like most people it's not that I don't feel for them, but /r/pics isn't /r/pics just because it has pictures. The entire point of it is *interesting* pictures. Not interesting stories.

I mean, it's much better since it tightened itself up a year or so ago, but I'm sure I'm not the only one tired of feeling like a distant relative is showing me their really bad scrapbook. I like interesting pictures. They're interesting. And call me cold or heartless or whatever, but I really don't care who in your family died this year. There are other places to tell us about that with the added bonus of not having to come up with a semi-relevant picture to make it fit. Although for some people that's not an option since it keeps them from their sweet karma, but I don't mean to imply that that's everyone's intention.

So let's say on Fridays there are no titles like that. It either has to be directly about the picture itself like you have over at /r/earthporn, or titles are just replaced by a random ID, or whatever, but still allowing for [OC] tags and all that. And they could still be free to tell us their sad stories in the comments, but without it influencing the voting masses. Basically just making the picture itself the focus of the post, and letting *that* be judged by its own merits.

I guess it's pretty obvious how it would turn out. Small, uninteresting pictures of rocks would be voted on accordingly and the front page would have genuinely interesting things. In theory. It's not something I've thought far into, since I really don't know how a No Title Friday would work outside of direct mod intervention (i.e. manually removing posts that don't follow it), but in my uneducated opinion I'm sure it would have that nice clean feeling we all like.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_12bl8h,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/12bl8h/what_would_rpics_be_like_on_a_hypothetical_no/,

The question: Why are Stainless Steel pans and skillets recommended over Non-Stick ones?

First, I asked in /r/buyitforlife, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/108ehl/why_are_stainless_steel_pans_and_skillets/)

Then, I asked in /r/AskCulinary, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/109tx3/why_are_stainless_steel_pans_and_skillets/)

Finally, I asked in /r/askreddit, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10begl/why_are_stainless_steel_pans_and_skillets/)

I used three different accounts in order to not have it so people could see that I previously posted the question, and I staggered it so that my question would hopefully not hit the top more than once at a time.

From what I could see, each subreddit gave similar information, albeit they each had a different focus. /r/buyitforlife was more concerned about the longevity of the equipment, while /r/AskCulinary was interested in cooking methods with each type of skillet. The people at /r/askreddit were mostly focused on getting the question answered.

In all three cases, the question was answered as asked, however, in the first two subreddits, there were discussions after the question was answered. I found that in /r/askreddit, that people were less likely to have a back and forth conversation. It could be because there was a small niche interest group that could relate to each other, or it could be because of any other number of reasons.

Please compare threads, and create observations and speculate away. I would also ask for you to duplicate my experiment with other questions, to see if it is repeatable. Place your niche subreddits up against your more general subreddits and compare the amount and quality of posts.

It is a choice of whether or not the question is urgent which should decide which subreddit a question goes into. Whereas askreddit is quicker, the smaller sureddits give greater quality and quantity of information. If there is no rush, like if you are buying a new frying pan, then the niche subreddits are substantially better. For time sensitive questions, askreddit is quick and easy.

What if, once a year, we declared a ""festival period"" of three days during which participating subs simply stopped moderating their submissions altogether.

This would, I think, serve a couple of functions. In subs that have been palpably improved by good moderation, it would serve to remind users of how bad things can get without that moderation. In subs where the value of moderation is more questionable, it would allow everyone to see how little their current moderation changes about the community. And for everyone it would serve as a limited test of the current state of moderation in their sub.

To mark the occasion, we could develop CSS that would black out the moderators names in the sidebar of participating subs. The holiday would begin with an official ""last act"" of the standing mods – basically a tongue-in-cheek post explaining what's about to happen (complete with hints at where the mods will be going for their fake holiday) and declaring the beginning of the holiday.

Once the holiday starts, the mods go AWOL. They can, of course, keep an eye on the sub, and contribute as regular users. But in principle, at least, they should not do any moderating. That means no removing off-topic posts, no releasing anything from the spam filter, no updating the CSS or marking posts NSFW or toying with flair. Of course, each mod team can decide for themselves how far they want to take this, but the ideal would be zero moderation for the duration of the holiday.

After 72 hours, the holiday ends with a ""commemorative plaque"" – basically, a post giving a brief run down of anything notable that happened during the holiday. That could include a list of the 10 most popular submissions made during that time, or a recap of any sub drama that ensued, as well as an explanation of what the mods are doing to clean up any leftover mess. After that, things go back to normal – unless, of course, anyone has learned something valuable from the ~~middle finger~~ experiment.

If anyone's interested in giving this a try, I say we take a week or two to get the word out. That would put the dates for Modnic 2012 at **July 15 through July 17th**.

I'm not usually paranoid, but the advertising game really interests me, one of the scariest forms (which I'm not really even sure exists to any extent) came from the movie ""The Joneses"".

&gt;A good moderator is one that ensures the subreddit remains on topic, and is one who is not afraid to remove garbage content just because it has a high amount of upvotes.

My response:

&gt;This is exactly what we do on f7u12. This is also why we are notoriously known as ""horrible mods."" We are constantly accused of asserting too much power over the content.

&gt; I think the problem is that the majority of Reddit users don't know (and don't care to know) how a properly run subreddit works. Most Redditors believe that the least intervention possible technique is what makes a good subreddit. This is the type of mob mentality that forces otherwise good moderators into being ""shit,"" because honestly, it's not worth the constant bitching. Moderators don't get paid, so there is no incentive for the upkeeping of a subreddit.

&gt; From what I've seen, there are very few Redditors left who are dedicated to maintaining a decent subreddit. Most of these Redditors, though, don't moderate the major subreddits. Luckily, f7u12 have gotten a few of these dying breeds, and our content has improved drastically.
Though, we haven't been a default subreddit for almost 2 years because of the fact that popularity = death of a good subreddit.

_____

So what is the back page? Simply put, it's a list of the 25 lowest voted reddit posts in a given time period (you can choose from all time, year, month, week, 24 hours, or hour). You can access the ""last 24 hours"" page through the following link: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/all/top/?t=all&amp;before=t3_14ymyf&amp;t=day

If you get ""there doesn't seem to be anything here"", check the following:

* Look in your preferences for the option to ""hide links with a score lower than..."". If it's set to something (probably -4) disable it by leaving the field empty. 

* Also make sure you don't have ""hide links I've downvoted"" enabled.

* If you're using RES, try loading the page without the extension (open an incognito window or a different browser to do this without removing the extension). There's a small chance that RES's never ending reddit feature will break the page. 

____
Notice how the URL has the *&amp;t=day tag*. This is important because attempting to change the time period from the ""back page"" will redirect you to /r/all/top. There are two ways to change the time period:

* Go to /r/all/top, change the time period to whatever you desire, and then follow the following link (it has the 24 hour tag removed): http://www.reddit.com/r/all/top/?t=all&amp;before=t3_14ymyf

* Replace the *&amp;t=day* with another time tag. Here are the others: &amp;t=hour ; &amp;t=week ; &amp;t=month ; &amp;t=year ; &amp;t=all


Now, you may be interested in how the back page works. Here's how: 

Whenever you visit page 2 of the front page, reddit will give you a url in the following format: 

     
     http://www.reddit.com/?count=25&amp;after=t3_1kern4

?count=25 tells reddit that the first post on the page will be labeled as ""25"". You can alter the count on the url and change the numbers displayed, but the links will be the same. For example,

 http://www.reddit.com/?count=8008134&amp;after=t3_1kern4

will tell you that the 1st post on this page is post number 8008135 ^^^huehuehue ^^^BOOBIES

Long story short, modifying that part of the url is irrelevant and won't alter the content. What's important is the post ID contained in the url. The bolded part is the post ID

reddit.com/?count=25&amp;after=t3_**1kern4**

Post ID's can be found on the post comment page's URL

For example, the post with the ID 1kern4 is the 26th post on the **my front page** (and not /r/all's top, which is what I used for the back page). 

So how do you determine a post's ID? Just check the URL:

reddit.com/r\/Kawaii_Eyes/comments/**1kern4**/ssensei_i_llike_you/

Fun fact: you can make ""short links"" to posts by simply adding the post ID to the end of reddit's URL

www.reddit.com/1kern4/ will link to said post!

The last important part of the url is the fact that it says ""after""

reddit.com/?count=25&amp;**after**=t3_1kern4

This tells the page to load posts that are *less popular* than the post ID'd in the url. 

Simply put, the URL tells reddit to display posts ranking below the post ID'd in the url. The normal front page does this by relative popularity (so small subreddits you've subscribed to work). In /r/all/top, it tells the page to display posts in descending order of net upvotes. 

_________

The back page's url has been modified. ""after"" has been replaced with ""before"" (reversing the order) and the post ID included is the ID of [the lowest rated reddit post of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ymyf/we_are_members_of_the_westboro_baptist_church_we/) (WBC's AMA). This tells reddit to display posts in ascending order starting with the lowest rated post of all time (which is omitted from the page). Simply put, the page displays this

0.) Worst post of all time (not included)

1.) Worst post of time period (or 2nd worst post of all time)

2.) 2nd worst post of time period (or 3rd worst post of all time)

ect. 

The only limitation is the fact that it can only show 25 posts; the next button will not work. You can however modify the URL yourself with the 25th post's ID to generate a second page and so on.

One of the appealing features of reddit is that usernames are not emphasized by design as posts are supposed to be judged by their content. The voting system would then be used to sort these posts and hopefully the best content will rise to the top.

However, what we have in that thread is a failure of these two fundamental principles, and I argue that this situation is dangerous and destructive to reddit as a whole. As the top reply to that comment says, 

&gt; 98% of people reading your comments neglect to check your username before doing so.

What it implies is that readers should throw away the ""only content matters"" principle of reddit and have additional overhead of checking the username. It is a combination of novelty accounts making comments that look plausibly legitimate (as opposed to typical novelty accounts that look obviously funny or out of place) and reddit users upvoting them to the top which devalues the entire comment section.

So I'm curious if you agree that this demonstrates a failure in the current system, if you think something should be done about it, or if having to check the username is indeed the right way to handle this.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_1dr6ut,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1dr6ut/when_novelty_accounts_become_dangerous/,

I propose that this idea is extended to the comment section as well.

A bot would have a set of rules that assign a score to each comment, and remove comments that fall below a certain threshold. For example, on Slashdot this is known as ""lameness filter"".

Some of the rules proposed below are more clear-cut than others; some may need extra care to avoid leading to censorship. This is an initial suggestion to give some examples, I do not consider these rules perfect by any means. Moderators will be able to select which rules they want to enable in their subreddits.

First, rules that affect comment's score in a negative way:

* Too short.

* Contains a link to a .gif animation.

* Contains a link to a blacklisted domain (e.g., quickmeme.com).

* All caps.

* Low score on a [readability test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_test).

* Contains a word from a blacklist (e.g., slurs).

* Newly registered accounts.

Some positive rules:

* Long comments.

* Contains link(s). Images may be given a lower positive score than generic links. Educational and .org domains can be given a higher score.

* High score on a readability test.

* Comment is part of a conversation. That is, if poster B replied to poster A, then a subsequent reply from poster A would be given a higher score.

* Comments from the OP.

We can also look at spam-filtering rules for more ideas.

Some initial questions to get the discussion started. Does this whole idea have merit? What (types of) subreddits would be appropriate for it? Would moderators of these subreddits be willing to try it out? Good/bad/dangerous rules?

Even if people have their comments removed, it's not particularly punitive, especially when they already have cashed in some comment karma with an off-topic quip.

Additionally, with so much crap floating around before mods can get to it, the culture inevitably starts changing. It used to be the vast majority of comments were in that particular ""askscience"" tone that I came to recognize, with everything else that deviated too far from it downvoted into hiding. Without the constant reinforcement of what it *should* be, the new voters have little idea what the standard is for an excellent comment is (fuck, I miss RobotRollCall).

That's a structural problem with the way that the AS mods are dealing with it. Sure, you can remove the blatant crap, but you also need the steady input of excellent comments for noobs to adopt that as the standard, which the mods really have no way of emphasizing or highlighting.

I won't go so far as to say it's hopeless, but it'll take extreme dedication on the part of the ""good"" people of AskScience to fight the uphill battle while carrying the massive weight of people who don't know any better and their misguided votes. I'd argue that they need to remove themselves from the default so they can stem the influx a little, at least until they get most of the noobs up to speed. Because no matter how exhaustive your sidebar links are on your vision for the subreddit, the problem people are those who aren't going to put in the time to familiarize themselves with the rules. It takes repeated interactions with standard bearers, mod or not, for a subreddit to defend its culture.

This problem reflects on the larger issue of elitism, which is the most frequent, as well as most accurate, accusation that we receive in ToR. With something like science, it's much easier to talk shit about Eternal September, because science is not a popularity contest. I'd extrapolate this to other topics as well, because the most interesting thoughts come the most consistently from the elite folks at the frontier. I don't believe in the democratic ideal, at least in matters of taste. I'd rather place myself in an avant-garde bubble, because I *want* to be superior to the ""commoners"" goddamnit. BUt the perpetual retreat into smaller subreddits blows. 

I stopped giving a shit about the big subreddits a while back, but it makes me sad to see r/askscience fall prey to the same old cycle of being a victim of its own success. It was the best of the subreddits, and it shouldn't have to end this way.

1. We need a bulk approval/removal mechanism for reported comments. Particularly, if I've removed the 'bad' comments, I need to be able to click a button and approve the rest.

2. Deleted posts need to be removed not [deleted].

3. If I approve a post/comment, I should be able to ""permapprove"" it. Ie, no future reports on that post/comment show up because it has been cleared by moderation staff as appropriate. 

Maybe others, this is what we needed at least to do our jobs effectively instead of fighting *both* users **and** reddit itself.

I think there's a **big** undercurrent of support for increased moderation in r/politics, r/pics, etc. to improve the *quality* of the reddit. But there really is no way the moderators can *implement* that moderation strategy. If we could get all the big reddits and big moderation teams the tools they need, perhaps we could convince the userbase that ""srsbzns"" reddits aren't the place for herp-derpery. Perhaps we could convince the average redditor that each reddit is actually *moderated* according to that reddit's rules, and they should act accordingly.

The structure of reddit simply promotes entertainment with its upvote/downvote system. If misleading news is entertaining, then by all means it goes to the front page. And very likely a redditor calling BS in the comments.

If at any time you think to post ""well, I've personally seen..."" and see 450 comments that should give you an indication that a lot of people are talking out of their ass.

Anecdotes are a worthless measure of frequency and make such claims prone to [availability heuristic.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic) Measuring overt anecdotes (how many people visibly reply to a thread in support/opposition of a stance) may be even worse because it's prone to being gamed.

The correct response is that **you don't know** because of two very important factors:

1. You would need proper means of gauging misogyny such as an unbiased sample, and something a bit more rigorous than a self-report scale

2. Define ""misogyny""

2 is the reason why you will never find an adequate answer to this question, because ""misogyny"" is second to only ""terrorism"" in ""words that people have an ideological interest in defining their way.""

Even professional social scientists have trouble measuring things like attitudes toward women; it is a definitional minefield. The only appropriate answer is to be agnostic about it until you know for sure, which you don't, due to numerous cognitive biases that mandate a proper analysis for any sort of claim to certainty.

The ones who vote blindly from the front page, or the ones who comment, contribute to and care about the community?",,67,20,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/mj0ln/active_moderation_vs_the_laissezfaire_approach_or/,"As many of you know, [/r/pics](/r/pics) has recently overgone a major overhaul in terms of the official subreddit rules and the degree to which moderators keep a close eye on the front page. [Five simple rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/lb24q/rpics_ruleset/) have given way to sweeping changes in the overall image of the subreddit; no pictures of text (including image macros), no gore or anything nsfw, no personal information (including images hosted on facebook's servers), no solicitation of votes or 'DAE-style' submissions, and no non-author urls in images.

Many users speculated that these changes would create an outcry from the subscribers, that the moderators were overstepping their bounds. *We should let the votes decide; if subscribers didn't enjoy these images,* they said, *they wouldn't keep getting voted to the front page! If the moderators enforced these new rules, there will be backlash, cries of oppression, witch hunts!* Indeed, the [recent controversy](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/mhant/legitimate_rpolitics_censorship_drama_involving/) in [/r/politics](/r/politics) and [/r/wtf](/r/wtf) have seemingly proven this point.

However, I disagree with this argument. The recent controversy on ""against censorship day"" was due to simple miscommunication between the mods and the users, as well as poor communication between the mods themselves. In the SFWPorn Network, a network home to most likely the strictest subreddits around in terms of rules and the enforcement of those rules by the mod team, there have been no witch hunts, no cries of censorship and oppression. There is a sense of trust between the mods and the userbase. The rules are plainly spelled out, enforced universally, and the distrust of moderators that exists in the default reddits is virtually non-existent.

I believe this is due to the fact that everyone 'knows the deal,' so to speak. No one expects to submit a rage comic to /r/EarthPorn and receive anything but downvotes. However, in /r/wtf, rage comics are frequent, if not commonplace. When one is removed from the front page due to some obscure (or worse, unwritten) rule, the users have every right to cry ""foul!"" Why shouldn't they? Moderators should be accountable for their actions. If a submission is removed, it should be plainly justified by citing a rule that is plainly visible either on the sidebar of the subreddit, or in a document that is linked to in the sidebar. 'Shadowbanning' submissions without clear justification other than the mod ""didn't feel it belonged"" is a good way to start a witch hunt. Try starting a witch hunt when the user is clearly in violation of the rules and the mod was justified (as well as courteous and polite). It won't happen, it won't get out of the new queue, and [the OP will be relentlessly flamed](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lozqp/where_can_i_make_a_formal_complaint_about_a/).

Let's get back to [/r/pics](/r/pics), and specifically their new ruleset, the main reason I created this thread. When they officially announced their new rules, it was initially met with lackluster reception. As documented in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/lb24q/rpics_ruleset/c2rf91x), **after the first 17 hours, the announcement had only 35 upvotes and 18 downvotes.** In a subreddit of over a million users, those numbers are simply pathetic. Any other thread would have died in the new queue. However, most threads haven't been sitting in a permanent sticky on the front page of [/r/pics](/r/pics) for over a month.

**As of this writing, as 9am on November 20th, 2011, the announcement is sitting at over 900 karma, with 1,263 upvotes and 357 downvotes.** A quick scan of the comments shows an overwhelmingly positive reaction from the userbase. This is the top comment:

&gt;kwangqengelele 337 points 1 month ago (398|60)   
&gt;I fully support this. No more text screenshots.

Which leads us to the question, if so many commenters are in favor of proper rules &amp; moderation, why were these types of submissions being upvoted to the front page at all? Why didn't they die in the new queue amidst a torrent of downvotes? It's very simple; the vast majority of redditors vote from the front page. These users reddit in fifteen minute increments. They are here for cheap laughs. They just spent 10 minutes on 4chan and will probably start browsing tumblr when they are through with reddit. They don't care what subreddit a submission came from; they are hear for the quick humor and are handing out upvotes like it's chewing gum.

There are two types of users on reddit, the lurkers and contributors. By lurkers, I'm not talking about the users who comment once in a blue moon here. I'm talking about the users who never comment. The ones who probably don't even know that such a thing as subreddits even *exist*. If your computer illiterate aunt created a reddit account, she would be one of these users. These users are why a submission will reach the front page even when the comments section is tearing the OP to threads. Collectively these users are known as the 'hivemind,' and many moderators make the mistake of catering to these users. *Someone upvoted all of these posts, so they must be appropriate for the subreddit, right?* I'll tell you why that line of reasoning is wrong.

These users contribute absolutely nothing to the community. Reddit is a source of entertainment to them. They have no idea how it works, only that it produces a steady stream of cheap entertainment for them to consume. The users who shape a subreddit, the ones who drive it forward, these users are the ones the moderators should cater to above all others. Commonly referred to as ""the vocal minority,"" these users are often brushed aside.

**Not in [my subreddits](http://redditdirectory.com/6301/syncretic), they aren't.**

As moderators, we need to be catering to the contributors. The artists. The musicians. The photographers. The writers. The users who create the content, not just consume it. The users who browse by subreddit, not from the front page. The ones who have a *customized* front page. The ones who comment on a regular basis. The ones who have a working knowledge of how reddit works. We can't allow the hivemind to dictate the future of reddit. If we do, we are nothing more than a glorified image board. We are 4chan with upvotes.

Do you know why that musn't be allowed?

Because the lurkers will eventually do one of two things; many of them will abandon reddit and move onto the next flavor of the week. In that case, who cared what they wanted anyway? They weren't a true redditor, they were just visiting. The ones that stay, however, those users will stop lurking some day. One day they will leave an insightful comment, and it will be upvoted. As everyone reading this knows, that first upvote is beautiful... and addicting. Some users are content to stay as commenters, and that's fine. Comments bring value to a community; after all, who wants to stay in a subreddit where no one leaves comments? But some users won't be content with just commenting.

After a while, they may try submitting a few links. These first links will get stuck in the spam filter, as a user's first submissions to a subreddit often do. Hopefully by now they know about mod mail, and what is it for. A polite, courteous and helpful mod will be there to either approve their submission, or tell them why exactly it was removed. After a few submissions are rescued, the spam filter is trained to like submissions from that user. They start submitting more, gaining karma and hopefully some new friends along the way. Guess what? They aren't lurkers anymore. Now is when their opinion should matter... when they are an active member of the community.

**TL;DR:** Get the fuck out of here. I didn't spend almost two hours composing this thread so you could TL;DR this shit.

Abstract:
&gt;[The] World Wide Web is now teeming with user generated content as more and more sites allow users to
become an integral part of content generation and
dissemination. Several sites such as Youtube, Digg,
Twitter, Facebook, Reddit allow users to post content of their choice, comment on and rate the content
posted by other users. This user generated content
has given rise to a whole bunch of interesting problems such as prediction of content popularity, user
popularity and many more. Solving these kind of
problems involves understanding the underlying sociological processes and coming up with appropriate
algorithmic solutions. The goal of this report is two
fold. Firstly, I present my ﬁndings about the inﬂuence of various factors such as community aspects,
user attributes, content quality, multiple content exposures on the popularity of the content on Reddit.
Secondly, I propose models that can eﬀectively predict the content popularity in terms of the number of
comments a particular post would get at any given
point in time.

These theoretical users disapprove of the content and say so, as cleverly as possible, in comments. But then they all upvote the repost, because if the repost rises, more readers will see it, and therefore the comments associated with it will receive significantly more upvotes. For a user whose priority is comment karma, the best strategy is clearly to upvote OP every single time they leave a comment.

1355329561.0,46,self.TheoryOfReddit,14qbb9,Tagging posts as [XPOST] is banned in my subreddit except in rare cases. Here's why.,woahdude_moderator,80,34,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/14qbb9/tagging_posts_as_xpost_is_banned_in_my_subreddit/,"As most of you already know, crossposts (also also known as xposts) are submissions that are discovered in one subreddit, then posted in a different subreddit. Often times (but thankfully not always) people will tag crossposts with an [XPOST] tag in the title.

For a long time, I have discouraged the use of labelling posts with [xpost] tags in all my subreddits, particularly in /r/woahdude.

But recently I have made an actual ban on the practice (offending posts will be removed), except in two relatively rare cases:

----

**[XPOST] tags serve two main, legitimate purposes:**

* **They help promote small, esoteric subreddits** that many people may not be familiar with. 

It helps the subreddit find an audience, and it helps the people who enjoyed the post and would like to know where to find more submissions similar to it.

[Example](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/13go00/actual_photo_of_extreme_deep_field_from_hubble/): 

    Actual photo of Extreme Deep Field from Hubble [pic] [xpost from exposureporn]    
    ((subreddit has fewer than 20k subscribers))

* **They help source original content that was posted elsewhere on Reddit.** Sometimes a redditor will post their own original content to Reddit, and if that content is then crossposted by another user elsewhere on reddit, it should be sourced to give the original author credit.

At least for my subreddit, the **mandatory** part of the sourcing processes includes providing a link to the original post in the comment section. 

The **optional** part of the sourcing process is putting an [xpost] tag in the title, so other redditors will not be quick to assume the xposter is trying to claim authorship. But again, that part is only optional since as long as the xposter has sourced the original, she has done nothing wrong.

[Example](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/xufq5/fireworks_when_the_camera_refocuses_during_the/):

    Fireworks, when the camera refocuses during the explosion (x-post from r/ITookAPicture) [PIC]
    ((post was original content first posted by another redditor))

----

**But, it turns out the [xpost] tag is a double-edged sword. With the pros, come the cons.**

* Many redditors assume that a crosspost that is not labelled as a crosspost, now counts as a ""repost"". I don't understand the reasoning behind that, but it a much more widespread belief than you realize. Two examples from the last two days.

[Example 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/14jouc/pool_gif/c7dqetw?context=1):

    Complainer A - ""Nowadays it feels like everything gets reposted from /r/gifs to here.""
    User B - ""The word you are looking for is ""crossposted""
    Complainer A - ""over half of them aren't labeled as crossposts""

 [Example 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/14lz0l/cleaning_my_ferrari_gif/c7edfpo?context=3):

    Submission: Cleaning my Ferrari [GIF]
    ((unlabelled crosspost from the hugely popular /r/gifs))
    Comment: ever heard of NO REPOSTS, fucktard?????????????

This is despite the fact that /r/gifs is one of the most popular subreddits on the website, so there is no reason to promote them, and the content is not even original to a redditor, so there is no reason to source.

For every idiot that actually takes the time to harrass and verbally assault people about this, there are undoubtedly countless  users that don't but instead punish with downvotes -- with no regard to the actual function and purpose of the tag. It's basically turned into a human case of [that behavior experiment with monkeys, bananas and punishment](http://i.imgur.com/mleK7.jpg).

* Many redditors are of the mindset that if you don't add an [XPOST] tag, you are attempting to claim authorship of the submission.

[Example](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/14opng/sun_sequence_picxpost_from_rpics/c7fht6t):
    
    ""Got it. So when I cross post from another subreddit, 
    don't give any indication that it was from another subreddit. 
    Just act like it was something I found or made all on mine own.""

This is despite the fact that Reddit automatically provides a DISCUSSIONS tab at the top of every crosspost, which displays every instance of that crosspost on the entire site since the beginning of time. At any rate, that mindset is just plain cynical and accusatory. 

Furthermore, it also seems to imply that the first person to post something to reddit now somehow ""owns"" that submission and deserves to be recognized for providing a link to content they didn't even create. Imagine if every time someone made a post, they were expected to write [my friend told me about this] or if TIL's were tagged [XPOST classroom]. 

A random redditor shouldn't deserve credit for telling you about something any more than anyone else in real life deserves credit. Let credit be reserved for people who create original content, and for not people who tell you *about* other people's original content. For that, we already have a karma system to credit people who share.


----

**TL;DR -** 

Many posters now downvote and leave negative comments below submissions that don't use [xpost] tags, even when the above legitimate reasons for using xpost don't apply. 

Now there is a sort of [mindless machine](http://i.imgur.com/mleK7.jpg), which rewards people for mindlessly putting [xpost] on almost every single reddit post, and that same machine punishes people who refuse to partipate in cluttering up titles when it's unnecessary to do so.

I am actively banning the use of [XPOST] tags in order to throw a wrench into that machine. To save good posts from the mindless punishment, and to instead punish mindless behavior.

I'll feel bad if it isn't."") in /r/modnews.

This announcement enables wikis for different subreddits! It looks really cool, but currently it is just a trial period. However, it merits discussion -- this very much changes what a subreddit can offer in terms of common resources.

Some example ideas I just pulled up (I'm sure there are many, many, many others):

- Some equivalent of the FAQ, or common notions  
- A statement of scope (what this subreddit is about, and what it isn't)  
- Some exemplary posts and/or comments  
- Conversely, a list of common reposts  
- Archives of past things (e.g. a list of Subreddits of the Day in r/SRotD)  
- Outside links that may be of interest

What am I missing?

The wiki, of course, also has the potential to be misused. Some subreddits will turn them on for public editing, which will end well in some cases but maybe not others. I don't want to be pessimistic yet -- let's see what happens.

Notably, the wiki's version of markdown also supports images. This is quite different from ordinary Reddit posts, and has been cited as a reason that Reddit hasn't degenerated completely into an image board: it's still somewhat difficult (though not admittedly that hard) to comment with just an image relative to other boards, since someone has to click on a link. Now, moderators can add images to wiki pages, which seems like it will be useful.

Of course, it is most likely that the wiki will be gradually used for a couple minor things in some subreddits and spread as people realize its usefulness in others.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_y9zu9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/y9zu9/there_are_now_subreddit_wikis_albeit_in_beta_what/,

I am a very active in /r/hiphopheads, a subreddit devoted to all things hip hop. The phenomena I have observed though can be applied to many other subreddits, and maybe even Reddit as a whole. Before reading, some of my thoughts are heavily shaped by this post on [meta-contrarianism](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pv/intellectual_hipsters_and_metacontrarianism/) so you might want to give that a look-see.

In HHH, there is a distinct pattern in how new members behave. They will title their posts with things like ""This is REAL hip hop"" or make comments like ""mainstream rap is so ignorant"" and other hipster-y sentiments. It's actually an effort to signal to the larger community that they (the noobs) have valid opinions on hip hop, by dropping obscure artists (usually not even that obscure to most of us). These sorts of remarks will often be trashed by older members of the community, mocking them for having such a puffed-up arrogance about their underground rap credibility. In fact, there's an entire subreddit, /r/hiphopcirclejerk, that is devoted to making fun of commonly-expressed sentiments.

HHCJ is populated by a lot of countersignaling. You have to understand the content you're mocking, ""get it"" so to speak, to make fun of it. It's very similar to the way /r/circlejerk participants signal that they are somehow superior to the targets of their mockery. [Relevant xkcd](http://xkcd.com/774/)

There is a concept in poker called levels of thinking. Level 1 means you're making decisions based upon your own cards. Level 2 thinking, basing decisions on what you think your opponent has. Level 3, what you think your opponent thinks you have. This goes back and forth and scales up indefinitely. You have to fully understand the levels below your level of thinking so that you can predict what and why something is going to happen, so that you can exploit it to your advantage.

There is a constant scrabbling over each other on Reddit to ""meta"" out of a subject so as to claim superiority: 

""I hold political opinion, X.""  
""I used to hold the same idea... in freshman year of college.""  
""Social psychologist here, this is obviously just an instance of blah blah blah.""

That example isn't great, but the point should be clear enough. Especially because Reddit is pretty anonymous with a cacophony of voices, there's a much greater need to couch your opinions with signaling that you, in fact, know what you're talking about.

It's also amusing to observe how people who are operating at the same levels giggle about things like they're sharing an inside joke, while the folks operating at ""lower"" levels will feel belittled and not taken seriously. It's the same sort of indignation a child/teenager/freshman/anyone feels when two older folks go ""you're just going through that stage, we went through it too"" with knowing looks at each other. There's also the frustration when someone is at a higher level by themselves and are trying to explain that they disagree, but *fully understand* the other side's argument. Meaning, it's not a lack of information or experience, but rather a surplus that allowed them to move *beyond* the opposition's opinion.

Obviously, there isn't always a linear progression of opinions on any topic, but the pattern of oneupmanship holds in a lot of subreddits where there is a perceived need to signal at which level you are at.

I hope my blithering was interesting to at least a couple folks. Thanks for reading.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_r917h,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/r917h/social_signaling_on_reddit/,

A common complaint I've seen has been the overuse of the same tired old phrases in submission titles. These titles have become so prolific that they have become a meme in and of themselves. The problem is that while the title may be annoying, there is no compelling reason to completely prohibit such submissions, and indeed the majority of mods have no desire to do so. The submissions themselves are usually pretty interesting.

As many of you know, [/r/pics](/r/pics) has recently adopted a new set of rules, prominently displayed in the sidebar, that is aimed at cleaning up the front page of the once meme-and-screenshot-riddled subreddit. One of my co-moderators, roger_, developed some useful css that will display a big red warning beneath blatant rule violations, so they stand out and hopefully users will downvote/report such submissions.

Last night I took the liberty of modifying some of that code to include a warning on several unoriginal, extremely overused ""meme"" submission titles as well. Hopefully it will significantly reduce the amount of these types of titles in the future, by both educating the OP that these titles are undesirable, as well as implicitly encouraging our users to downvote such submissions. However, if the submissions are upvoted anyway, they will not be removed, because they technically violate no rule.

It boils down to this: **Once you get enough people involved in a reddit community, lowest common denominator content becomes impossible to avoid.**

When reddit goes down, the lowest common denominator subject for redditors is the fact that they can't access the site. So when reddit comes back up again, [submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/glffn/aaaaaaaaand_were_back/) [about](http://redd.it/glfkf) [the](http://redd.it/glfi3) [downtime](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/glfgj/ftfy/) are all but preordained to rise to the top. Not because they're particularly interesting, or informative. Simply because it's something that all redditors can relate to, especially those redditors who tried to log on during the downtime. Posts about the downtime net more up votes, and consequently rise to the top of the ""What's hot"" queue, elbowing out content with a narrower but more critical appeal.

Then comes the backlash. Because most redditors will see multiple submissions about the downtime on their front page, *that* becomes the new LCD. At which point, traction starts to build for posts (like this one, or, more to the point, [that one](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/glhqz/dear_reddit_users/)\) about the posts about the downtime. Less traction, of course, since not as many people will see the first round of downtime posts as were affected by the downtime, but traction all the same.

*So what?* someone will say. *People up vote what they like. If you don't like it, down vote and move on.* True, but part of my point is that the nature of how reddit's voting mechanism works is changed when the voting community reaches a certain size.

Take a spin through the smaller communities, those with fewer than, say, 25,000 subscribers. How many of them have front paged submissions about the downtime? Apart from /r/ToR (now), I'd wager very few.

There are, I suspect, a number of reasons for that. For one thing, the new queue is harder to keep up with when there are 500,000 people involved, as there are in /r/worldnews, where there have been 140 submissions in the last 24 hours (and that's with 6 hours of downtime). That means, first of all, that contributors are less likely to sort through all of the recent submissions to make sure their content hasn't already been submitted under a different URL.

Maybe more to the point, it means that, depending on when they log on, voters are more likely to distribute their votes among different sets of content, without looking for redundancy. In a community like /r/worldevents, which has under 4,000 subscribers and had only 4 new submissions in the last 24 hours, it's easy to keep up with the new queue, even if you only log in once every day or two. Subscribers aren't likely to up vote the same content twice, simply because they're not likely to have missed it the first time.

To be fair, I don't think that subscribers to large communities routinely up vote the same content twice. But it may be that the bar to up votes is unexpectedly lower, simply because those communities have so many more subscribers. It's hard to compare between the two, since smaller reddits get submissions gradually enough that a submission might stay on the front page for weeks, while a submission in a large subreddit has to continue getting up votes to stay on the front page for even a single day, but that's part of my point. The increase in active redditors is a quantitative change that results in qualitative differences.

So, for example, the lowest scoring submission currently on the /r/pics front page has a score of 56. That's in a reddit with 600,000+ subscribers, which means it got there on the strength of something like 0.0001% of the current subscribers bothering to vote on it at all, and which got 1,000+ submissions in the last 24 hours, which puts that submission in something like the top 2%. Most reddits would need an additional 100,000 subscribers or more to even aspire to that level of indifference, and yet on /r/pics, getting 0.0001% to vote at all (not even necessarily up) is an achievement that elevates your post above 98% of what's posted there.

In other words, fewer submissions make it to the front page of a large reddit, but those that *do* get there make it on the strength of a relatively low vote-to-voter ratio. Even given a smaller reddit that has enough daily submissions such that only submissions with a positive score are shown on the front page, the bar for entry relative to the number of available votes will tend to be much higher than in the super-reddits.

Since the new queue there moves so quickly, even most people who *do* check the new queue occasionally are likely to miss 90% of what's posted there, and far less likely to miss what's on the hot queue.

As a consequence, it's far easier for a large reddit to end up with multiple front page submissions about the same topic. After all, to get there in the first place, they only need a relatively insignificant proportion of the total available votes. What likely happens is this. Some of us are on from 12 to 1, looking through the new queue. There aren't many of us, but there are enough to promote something to front page status. And the submission we're most likely to agree on is the one with the broadest appeal. In this case, it's a post about reddit downtime. From 1 to 2, a different small group is cruising the new queue, and they promote another submission. They have a different pool of submissions to choose from, but since reddit downtime is still the LCD, they end up promoting, among other things, a post about reddit downtime.

That effect gets further amplified by the sheer number of submissions larger reddits get. Since it's harder to keep up with the new queue, there's a bigger reward for showing up on the front page. That /r/pics submission with a score of 56 isn't likely to cap out there. Because it's on the front page, subscribers who never look at the new queue will see it, making it eligible for votes that most submissions to /r/pics never had a chance of getting.

Earlier, two hypothetical groups voted two very similar posts onto the hot queue. Those posts get a boost in momentum from appearing there. Soon, they'll show up on the front page of /r/all. And since it doesn't take that much to get there (the current lowest scorer I see there has a mere 240 points) no single redditor has to vote up both submissions to get them to the front of /r/all.

The qualitative difference, then, is this. Submissions that rise to the top of the hot queue in small reddits will tend to be those approved by the average of the entire community. However, submissions that rise to the top of the hot queue in very large reddit will be those approved by a very small minority of subscribers who happened to be viewing the new queue when it appeared. Once on the hot queue, they will tend to maintain a more or less predictable life span there, benefiting from the momentum they gain from the sheer fact of being exposed to more potential votes than most submissions to the same reddit.

That's a pretty significant transformation of the way that reddit's voting mechanism works from one reddit to another.",,False,,t5_2rtff,True,,,True,t3_glm65,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/glm65/100000_people_walk_into_a_bar/,
1372299077.0,42,self.TheoryOfReddit,1h5gwe,Using Python to simulate the effects of the new queue on Reddit's submission ranking system (pt. 1),blackstar9000,59,17,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1h5gwe/using_python_to_simulate_the_effects_of_the_new/,"This is the first of a series of posts that discuss how I used a Python simulation to test the effects of Reddit's ""hot ranking"" algorithm.

## Background

Ever since [No Pics Day](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/iem31/ever_wonder_what_reddit_would_look_like_without/), I've been harping on the **hypothesis** *that the structure of the new queue gives a competitive advantage to submissions that link directly to image files.* The **corollary** to that hypothesis is that, *as an unmoderated subreddit grows more active, images will tend to outcompete other forms of content, regardless of what the users would prefer.* Some have called this the ""[fluff principle](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html),"" following Paul Graham's usage. I prefer to think of it as the ""conveyor belt problem,"" since that both avoids value judgments about the content that rises and evokes the mechanism that causes the rise.

Given some basic familiarity with how the site works, the conveyor belt argument seemed logically compelling to me. Nevertheless, whenever I've brought it up, there's been enough skepticism to allow others to outright deny its validity, or to downplay its significance, so I decided to put the idea to the test. To that end, I used Python to build a simulation of Reddit in order to run a few scenarios related to vote time.

Before I could run the simulation, though, I needed some reasonably accurate, real world numbers. So I wrote [another script](http://redd.it/1h5f3f), this one designed to help me estimate the median amount of time it takes redditors to vote on different types of submission. This post will cover the results of that experiment; I'll get to the full simulation in a subsequent post.

## Content categories

Submissions were drawn from 11 different subs, chosen specifically to provide a cross-section of common types of submission. They are: /r/AdviceAnimals,\* /r/AskReddit, /r/AskScience, /r/books, /r/comics, /r/gaming, /r/pics, /r/politics, /r/science, /r/TrueReddit, /r/videos and /r/worldnews.

By looking at the submission itself (or, in many cases, just the domain) I could derive a median evaluation time for different content types. Median was used to limit the amount of shift caused by statistical outliers. By looking at patterns in evaluation time, I was able to derive the following categories:

Content type | Median eval. time | Explanation | Example domain
:--- | :---: | :--- | ---:
Standard image | 325 seconds | Original, single-focus images | i.imgur.com
Familiarity-based image | 243 seconds | Image macros and [FIXED] | livememe.com
Longform images | 1400 second | Multi-focus images, e.g. comics, photoessays, albums | imgur.com
Video | 508 seconds | You know… videos | youtube.com
Self (all types combined) | 286 seconds| Reddit-hosted text-only posts | self.reddit.com
Title-centric self | 275 seconds | self.posts that can be evaluated by title alone | self.AskReddit
Thread-centric self | 575 seconds | self.posts evaluated on the basis of the body or comment text | self.AskScience
Articles (inverted pyramid) | 353 seconds | Articles structured to foreground important info | reuters.com 
Articles (essay style) | 522 seconds | Articles structured to gradually reveal important info | theatlantic.com

Finally, there were fewer than 20 posts that didn't really fit into any of those categories, or which it was important to exclude because they were clear contaminations of the data—blatant spam, for example, links to sales pages, a few links that were apparently posted in error. Incidentally, all of the overt spam collected came from a single sub: /r\/worldnews.

## Analysis

Right off the bat, we see a few perhaps unexpected results. While images tend to have relatively low evaluation times, the ""longform"" image category (e.g. multi-panel comics, image albums) has the longest evaluation times of the bunch. One possible explanation could be that a relatively small sample size has skewed the median. Another might be that the category encompasses too broad a variety of content types, from albums with only a few images, to multipage comics. Click-through time almost certainly plays a part, since these links usually can't be evaluated on the basis of a thumbnail image alone. Two related explanations strike me as particularly likely. One is that evaluation times simply rise when you have to ""read"" an unfamiliar image, and especially so with a set of images. The other is that, given the comparatively higher investment required by longform images, some redditors are simply less inclined to follow-through. If that's the case, then the long interval is due less to the amount of time actually need to evaluate the submission than it is to a relatively high proportion of users skipping longform image submissions altogether. Short of a test that can isolate the actual reason, though, I'm inclined to leave the result as is, rather than second-guess the data based on those assumptions.

Another result is that the self.post category actually breaks along natural lines into two categories, which I've illustrated by isolating AskReddit self.posts in their own table row. The median evaluation time for AskReddit posts is less than half as long as the median for all other subs tested, and was clearly responsible for skewing the entire category toward the lower median evaluation time. One explanation is that the AskReddit community tends to evaluate posts on their title rather than contents. To that end, I'm calling one set *title-centric* and the other *thread-centric*, though I fully admit that those names are burdened with interpretation.

For the most part, I've let stand some evaluation times that seem to me obvious outliers because one or two extremes does little to skew a median. However, about 18% of the entries in the inverted pyramid category have evaluation times over 15 minutes—about 3 times the median for that group. Not only does that present a statistical argument for second-guessing those entries, but the brevity of the articles themselves make it unlikely that anyone really took a full 15 minutes deciding how to vote. If we exclude those entries then the median shifts downward by more than a minute:

Content type | Median eval. time | Example domain
:--- | :---: | ---:
Articles (inverted pyramid) | 275 seconds | reuters.com 

However, since I can't logically account for the spike without making some unverified assumptions, I'll be using the higher evaluation time when I simulate voting habits. That prevents my own assumptions from skewing the data, and leaves open the possibility that voter apathy is a structural hazard of the inverted pyramid type of article.

Finally, it's worth nothing that, while it's common knowledge that [80% of all votes on Reddit are up votes](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/07/nerd-talk-tale-of-life-of-link-on.html), the ratio of up to down votes is approximately 50/50 when we're looking at first votes alone. I suspect that holds true for the new queue in general. That doesn't contradict Ketralnis' data, though. The most likely explanation is simply that up votes are that much more common on the front page and user home pages, where the majority of voting takes place and most spam, reposts and off-topic content have already been filtered by the Knights of the new.

In [my next post](http://redd.it/1h7r54), I'll move on to the simulation. In the meantime, feel free to discuss this data in more detail.

\* Things have changed a bit over at /r\/AdviceAnimals since these trials. Previously one of the most frequently used meme generator sites, Quickmeme has been banned site wide for vote manipulation. On the basis of a few cursory trials I've run since the ban, it doesn't look to me as though /u/gtw08's bot affected the results much, if at all—[jokes_on_you's explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1gvnk4/quickmeme_is_banned_redditwide_more_inside/cao99l6) seems to suggest that the vote manipulation took place mostly in the morning, so maybe the trials simply missed the times when the bot was active. Or maybe the bot simply wasn't the first vote in most cases. At any rate, when we extract the quickmeme votes from the rest of the set, you can see first votes for the quickmeme domains were up votes only slightly more than 50% of the time, which is an acceptable margin of deviation from the 50/50 ratio that holds for /r\/AdviceAnimals specifically and most new queue votes in general.

Two points of discussion:

1) We know that appending ""[fixed]"" to posts is usually out of humor (as an aside, it'd be super fun to do a data-driven study of [fixed] posts' success through the day to look at the evolution of those memes on reddit). But how often is [fixed] used to actually correct information or fix broken links? 

2) Further, how can this practice be better adopted for sharing information across reddit? These questions are particularly interesting to me because I've reported on research looking at similar correction-posting behaviors in /r/sandy (a subreddit that thrived on breaking news reporting) – [How Reddit reports breaking news: an analysis of /r/sandy](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1b6iw9/how_reddit_reports_breaking_news_an_analysis_of/) – and, compared to reported news content (eg., New York Times), users are more likely to upvote corrections (probably because they're seen as important) and users that subscribe to a wider variety of subreddits are more likely to post those corrections (eg., potentially one aspect of 'more experienced' reddit users) [see bottom of p. 6 for relevant stats]. I'd venture to say that these types of corrections are particularly important because it's hard to validate content on reddit (due to the nature of the technical limitations of the site's architecture), and visibility can easily be manipulated for all types of content (correct or incorrect) solely based on voting behaviors (and additionally, some mods choose to keep up incorrect information because of the discussion that occurs in the comments). Finally, there's a grey area around reddiquette where users are not encouraged to solicit upvotes for content, but perhaps those solicitations could be useful when trying to correct information. We've seen similar behaviors in /r/sandy (eg., ""downvote humor so relevant information can become visibile to those who need it!"" kind of messages, self-regulated by subreddit participants) and such behaviors certainly would have been useful in /r/findbostonbombers (for which I'm currently working on a project looking to see what actually happened in relation to that).

I used to submit my webcomics to reddit about a year ago. Back then, I noticed that there were two types of webcomics being upvoted: those that were already well established (XKCD, SMBC etc.), and those that were very poor. The latter were also engaged with more often. People would leave comments like ""really good effort!"", and other encouraging praise. 

There was always a gap, I felt, above these ""underdog"" submissions but below the already popular comics. There were a lot of really high quality, very funny comics (not just my own, but yes, I am somewhat arrogantly including mine in this grouping) which were being downvoted. My theory is that people assumed that these quality comics were already popular elsewhere, so they didn't need the ""boost"" of encouragement that was being given to the poorer comics. As a result, the top submissions in /r/webcomics and /r/comics were almost always a mix of poorly drawn, unfunny comics and well-established gems.

I don't draw my comic any more because I don't have the time and it eventually became less rewarding, but I always felt like I was in a valley. Not quite bad enough to be an underdog, but not quite good enough to be very popular. Perhaps if I'd persisted I would have gotten better.

Is this a delusion of mine, or is this a real effect? Outside of my example of webcomics, I often see sketch comedy troupes, artists, etc. being downvoted, and I can't help but be reminded of the Louis CK bit (apologies if it seems circle-jerky to invoke him) where he talks about nobody praising him for what he does, and that everyone says something to the effect of ""yeah, so what, that's your job."" I feel that if a submission has the *quality* of something that's already established, people will often assume that it *is* well-established and feel that it therefore doesn't belong here. But then where does it belong? Perhaps some of the concern is also to do with the fact that quality content might appear from the outside to be professional, and people might therefore assume that the creator is making money from it.

I've wanted to talk about this for a long time, but never have because I don't know how to avoid the inherent arrogance in what I've said. All I can do is assure you that I'm as self-critical as anyone else, and have no delusions about being ""the best"". Or do I?

So as you may have noticed, [1] /r/halo's self posts only ""week"" has gone on longer than expected. This is due to the significant improvement of the content that reaches the frontpage.
We would like to know what you think of this change. [2] /r/borderlands has been doing the same thing since the release of Borderlands 2 in September, but there has been a large decline in participation from the community there. One minute old submissions are reaching the top 10 with no upvotes.
[3] /r/trees has been doing a self posts Sunday that everyone there seems to enjoy. I am wondering if that will be a good step, but have that one day be a whole weekend possibly. Though, we would like to discuss this with all of your first, here are two options.
Keep it self posts only. Bring back Custom Weekends and other weekly ""events"".
Have day(s) dedicated to self posts and discussion. Possibly a ""Self posts Thursday"" (day after the Bulletin so there'll be something to talk about) or possibly a self post weekend. Still bring back Custom Weekends.
We'll also be adding more options for link flair down the line. And as for the SR 51-130 flair, it's nearly done and will be added very soon.

Now that Halo 4 is released, I expect the amount of people posting in [/r/halo](/r/halo) to significantly drop.

Because I'm on summer break and have plenty of free time, I ran an experiment over these past couple of days. The goal was simple:

* Create two accounts. One would be used to lose karma, the other would be used to gain karma.

* See how quickly I could reach -2000 karma on the first account, and how quickly I could reach + 2000 karma on the second account.

For my negative karma account, I began planning the perfect username to make Redditors rage. I went through many ideas, but I ended up settling on ""[MarajuanaYOLO](http://www.reddit.com/user/MarajuanaYOLO)"". Next, I simply posted or replied to people on popular subreddits' threads about things most Redditors hate while being a pompous ass and overusing smiley faces. In about 50 hours, I had received 2000 downvotes.

For my positive karma account, I didn't do as much planning with my username. I simply asked another Redditor friend for a username, and he replied with ""[FourGrapeJustice](http://www.reddit.com/user/FourGrapeJustice)"". I found that replying to threads on popular subreddits, but with things Redditors like to read, that it was much easier to make karma than it was to lose karma. I quickly became bored with the account. It wasn't as much of a challenge. I stopped posting after a couple hours, and went back to check the account every hour or so. In about twenty hours, I had received 2000 upvotes.

**CONCLUSION:** It is much more difficult to lose karma than it is to gain karma. In fact, this whole experiment has showed me karma is nothing more than meaningless internet points that can be easily obtained. Users like Trapped_In_Reddit and ProbablyHittingOnYou don't have impressive posting skills; they just post the same things to Reddit over and over again to build up their karma. I no longer judge accounts based on karma score, but on the genuineness of their posts.

I also theorize larger subreddits are not as fun to read because of all the people trying to karma whore. You get the same posts upvoted time and time again, and nothing new is added. Smaller subreddits tend to be better becrause of the uniqueness of each post, and that nobody is trying to gain kama, but simply share their ideas, thoughts, or stories. Sure, the picture might be reposted, but the discussion of the picture will be completely different the second time.

I also might add that there should be a limit on how much karma a user should be able to obtain. This might help cut down on karma whores.

I feel like many larger subreddits have too many people to feel connected to individual users. But a certain subreddit made me think about the possibility of community on reddit: /r/MLPLounge. 

As you might guess, it's meant to serve as a lounge subreddit for /r/mylittlepony. Users call it ""the PLounge"", and it has a very developed community, spawning an unknown number of subreddits for anything related to the PLounge. The 100 or so active users there have honest relationships with one another from all the conversations they've had. While, I don't participate as much in subreddits like /r/askreddit, it seems the more active users there don't have much of a communal relationship, and if they do, it's drowned out by the immense amount of other users. PLounge power-users have made it the [18th most commented subreddit on an average day,](http://stattit.com/r/mlplounge/) with over 6000 comments, despite it's 8000 subscribers. 

While the PLounge does fall to similar sarcastic jokes that any subreddit seems to fall to, there's a character base to the jokes. It's similar to being in a large group of friends. I have yet to find another subreddit that forms a community this strong. 

What makes the PLounge such a stand out case could be a result of various reasons. One is that the mods enjoy messing with the subreddit. The header, ""best filly"" on the sidebar, and bottom image change often. The mods also change the 200 most popular of the 7-8000 emotes to a particular theme every couple months. Or they'll even completely change just one. An example would be [/twisquint](http://i.imgur.com/E3MJmVh.png) (that's the unedited version). The mods changed it (and many other aspects of the subreddit) to a bee icon. This spurred a lot of long comment threads. The emotes are a second possible reason that the PLounge is so active. It seems to give a bit more life to the comments, and since there's over 7000 emotes, individual ones don't get overused and obnoxious. The other reason I can think of is the approach the community has towards new users. The power users welcome new users into their community no matter what kind of person they are. People can honestly admit to being a furry, enjoying pony porn, or any other social taboo and it's ok. Lastly, there's no thought towards karma. It's a low karma subreddit, thus nobody tries to be a ""karmawhore""

**TL;DR for the above paragraphs explaining /r/MLPLounge: It's a very active user based subreddit with a sense of community, but please read the description of it**

So the PLounge made me try to find another subreddit like it, but I can't seem to find a place where a sense of community and caring for other users it the basis. Sure some subreddits with up to 3000 may have a couple users who talk with each other as friends such as /r/evangelion and /r/clannad, but those subreddits still have very little community sense to them.

What is essentially happening is that users are upvoting posts and comments they agree with and downvoting ones they disagree with. For example if you submitted a story saying ""Democrats do something good"" to r/politics it would generally get upvoted while ""Republics do something good"" would generally get downvoted. The same is largely true with comments. Because of this when new people read a sub-reddit they see only a certain set of stories that the other people their like i.e. ""Democrats do something good."" If they agree with this they are more likely to join the sub-reddit if they disagree they are more likely to leave. Thus the bias of the sub-reddit becomes even stronger.

Should he have been out right banned?

Should your account history (trophies and karma) come into play on bans? Should there be warnings for accounts with good records more than for one day old spam accounts?

Should the fact that he paid for Reddit gold come into play?

If somehow you missed it: in short a customer got shitty service from this guy who runs a company called Ocean Marketing after they hadn't shipped out or completed their product by the promised date and had started offering discounts to new customers, penalizing their current customers. The Ocean Marketing guy, Paul, acted unprofessionally and started bulling his customer, saying a bunch of BS about how he knew the mayor of Boston and all the major tech blogs, mentioned PAX, Mike Krahulik (aka Gabe) who runs PAX got wind of it and everything exploded.

Of course, the backlash here was huge. Penny Arcade probably if not certainly caused most of the problems, but reddit will be reddit, and we certainly helped. I'm not necessarily saying Paul didn't deserve it; he ruined himself. But the usual posts to his Facebook page (for privacy reasons, I'm not linking), links to a domestic violence report filed by his wife, and today [a post saying we still need to destroy him even though he's probably already been done in](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/nu8j8/christforo_still_doesnt_get_it_can_we_help_him_out/) ensued.

This is something that happens on the major reddits more often than most of us would care to admit. [/r/gaming](/r/gaming) had [another incident like this only a few months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/mcy7l/today_i_received_nonstop_phone_calls_and_emails/), and in that case the redditor involved was entirely innocent in the affair (and she was only being attacked because she *worked* for the company in question). Both of these occurred after [the reddit admins publicly decried this behavior](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/05/reddit-we-need-to-talk.html) which occurred after it was decried by moderators on AskReddit (sorry, don't have this link) which occurred after [it was decried by the admins the first time](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/ffaew/a_special_guest_post_on_misguided_vigilantism/).

TL;DR up to here: Vigilantism is still a problem on reddit, even though there have been major attempts to stop it and it's fully against the site rules.

Now, I know the general claim here is that it's a select few who actually participate in the bullying, but I don't believe that to be the case. Even from just looking at the above linked post about destroying him, I see heavily upvoted comments about how we still need to destroy him, how this belongs on the front page of reddit, lists of his potential clients, and perhaps most tellingly, massively downvoted comments saying to go easy on him or back off.

When you get a bunch of like minded people together in a room (and that is, after all, the goal of most subreddits), it is easy to spark them into action that takes little effort and has great reward (the reward here being the ability to be powerful).

Preventing this from happening, while obviously necessarily, is not trivial. I personally think we need to change attitudes on posting any personal information on other people, on any widespread attacks, etc. The problem is that changing attitudes isn't easy to do. I think we can start by commenting against anyone who does this, and perhaps linking to reminders like the reddit blog post from back in May. Reporting inciting comments is also a good idea.

Yesterday [soapyluggage](http://www.reddit.com/user/soapyluggage) (one of the moderators of r/skyrim) ~~made~~ announced [this highly unpopular change in the rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mf027/update_to_the_subreddit_rules/), banning all direct image links from the subreddit (self-posts with image links still allowed) in response to an overwhelming amount of macros posted since Skyrim's release. As can clearly be seen, the community didn't exactly welcome the change with 266 upvotes and 706 downvotes - I counted a grand total of 8 responses to the post (as opposed to responses to comments) supporting the measure, each one downvoted to Oblivion (ha).

There have been two response posts ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mf9je/hey_moderators_i_really_like_single_picture_posts/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mfoiv/motion_to_demod_soapyluggage/)) drumming up support for turning over the rule and removing soapyluggage as a mod - the first with 2126 upvotes, the second with 2212. 

This is obviously quite the overreaction, since soapyluggage made it clear that this was an agreement between the mods, not simply his idea. As voiced in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mfoiv/motion_to_demod_soapyluggage/c30jomm) comment by bing_crosby, it seems the community is dealing with a new rule in a very immature way.

Just by my own observations, I noticed two common trends within the comments that absolutely drive me insane.

1. Upvotes/downvotes are the best method of moderation

2. Mods shouldn't care about karma whoring

Number 1 is something I've had to argue against before in r/minecraft, and is well-put by PipGirl [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mf9je/hey_moderators_i_really_like_single_picture_posts/c30hp4k): there is a difference between popularity and community involvement, and one-click laffs generally don't add anything to a community, which is why moderators have to step in to keep the community alive.

That actually feeds into my second annoyance: mods generally don't care about karma-whoring, they care about the *outcome* of karma-whoring; that is to say, internet points don't matter, but if the entire frontpage of a subreddit is dominated by memes that add nothing to the community, then problems arise. 

I, personally, don't think submitting images as self-posts is too much to ask of a community, and is a good way of keeping the one-click bullshit away while still allowing images that actually add something. Unfortunately, the community response is indicative of how misinformation and immaturity can easily combat quality control.

EDIT: Let me reiterate that I am not voicing my support of this particular rule; to be honest, I believe it would be more effective to go with complete self-posts. I am simply commenting on the lack of sense and civility shown by a classic example of one of Reddit's infamous mobs. I believe the implementation of this rule is nonetheless a step in the right direction; however, without popular support, I doubt it will get anywhere. 

EDIT2: Another r/skyrim moderator, [DrupalDev](http://www.reddit.com/user/DrupalDev), has announced the [rule is to be turned over](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mgg4y/alright_guys_and_gals_shows_over_were_reverting/), along with the fact that soapyluggage has decided to resign as a mod of r/skyrim (which I find ridiculous, but it's his own decision). A huge lack of popular support will do that to you. I still applaud the mods for attempting to reign in their fast-growing subreddit, even if the rule implemented was not the most effective approach.

Personally, I like Reddit (when I like it -- which isn't always) for its utility. The internet pumps out content by the terabyte, and it's useful to have a site that helps sort through the noise to get to the sort of content you want to see. And while the community, [such as it is](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/how-reddit-works.html), sometimes does cool stuff, I appreciate it most when it's centered on that utility -- *finding* cool stuff on the web (rather than trying to make it), discussing the cool stuff that we find, and (as we do here in /r/ToR) trying to make the system work better so that Reddit actually stays a useful way to filter through all of the crap we don't want to see on the internet (rather than adding to that burden). So a reddit convention doesn't really appeal to me.

But what about the rest of you? Do you think it makes sense to have a convention for whatever it is we do here? Does the fact that a convention makes sense to some people signal that what we do here has fundamentally changed?

I'm not just talking about superficial matters like reposts, racist jokes, or locats. I'm talking about similarity in types of content, what I think links the two more deeply than memes alone. In my estimation, 4chan is made up of these distinct types of posts (there are others, but these stand out to me):

* camwhores

* drug culture

* photoshopping (including, but not limited to: image macros, manipulated gifs, etc...)

* heavy focus on relationships and sex oriented posts (including suicidal/baww posts and alpha male instructionals)

* rage faces

* cute animal obsession

* nostalgia

* you &lt;X&gt;, you lose

* heavy focus on arbitrary numbers (4chan has post count; reddit has karma)

* community generated content and focus

Reddit has, for the most part, matched 4chan tit for tat with analogous posts. Now, I've recently noticed the upward trend of ""my face when"" posts, commonly abbreviated MFW. These are a type of reaction shot popularized on 4chan, and usually accompanied by a short phrase, such as ""MFW you just lost the game"". For illustrative purposes, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/hxmge/this_is_my_reaction_when_i_get_three_upvotes/) is a current frontpage post that fits the bill.

What causes this parallel growth? Is it simply a function of an overlapping userbase?  Is it a result of both user driven content combined with user interface lending itself more toward picture driven posts? Or something else entirely? I personally lean toward the latter. Reddit is unique in that it supports image upload thumbnails next to the headlines. Fark doesn't support this, nor does Slashdot, or Metafilter. Digg does, but it never manifested any of those similar traits. They appear to be exclusive to Reddit and 4chan. Perhaps it's related to the size and position of the thumbnail. Digg's image thumbs are noticeably smaller overall, and awkwardly placed to the right of the text where I suspect it tends to go unnoticed.

It's conventional wisdom among the elitist cultural marxists of this subreddit that rage comics are just another indicator of our decreasing ability to tell a story. They have a truncated form, due to practical and now rule-based prohibitions against lots of words, as well as short attention span on the part of the audience. Then there's the repetitive elements. You have a finite number of faces (obviously more can be made but you get the point) which obstructs the expression of the wide range of emotions we have. (Ever try to make a comic and realize there's no face to communicate how you felt at that particular moment of the story? Yeah.)

So, questions: Is it better to have prohibitions on word usage? In my opinion, it seems to bring it more back in line with how these comics used to be and has a nicer form to it overall. On the other hand, it seems to decrease the overall expression possible. Perhaps, though, that's a good thing: instead of people expressing themselves with an overly word rage comic, they'll write it out.  I'm ambivalent. I guess, overall, the question is how expressive rage comics are. I'm saying barely at all.

Ideas on anonymity, reddit, Facebook, and subreddits",westinger,60,19,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/14t1di/what_contributes_to_good_discussion_on_reddit/,"Reddit is always constantly amazing me--though sometimes I want to share the amazement with everybody around me, and other times I am disappointed in the community.  

I am, however, willing to be forgiving.  We are a large community ([a quick google search revealed about 40 million users](http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/resource-how-many-people-use-the-top-social-media/)), and everybody makes mistakes sometimes, and that is multiplied by several millions = lots of mistakes.  Oftentimes, these are either downvoted, or removed by the mods.  

**Anonymity and good/bad conversation on reddit**
On reddit, we don't care what people think of us (as long as we get that sweet, sweet karma).  This gives redditors a lot of freedom, and I would argue, responsibility.  The anonymity gives a redditor the freedom to be a complete dicktroll, and antagonize everybody.  It also gives people the opportunity to make a stupid joke, that oftentimes wouldn't be made in person because it is so off-topic, rude, or crude that they wouldn't say it to people IRL.  But on the internet it is funny, sometimes.  And then tree fiddy, I digress.  

But the anonymity also is what makes reddit great.  It is a safe place, where your controversial opinion can be discussed, without marginalizing you from your coworkers, acquaintances, family, and friends.  Your ideas on homosexuality will not jeopardize your job security, or your standing on the PTO.  *I think this is great, and allows a lot of different viewpoints to be expressed in various subreddits.*  

**reddit discussion vs. Facebook discussion**
What prompted my interest in this topic, is that everybody IRL and on reddit complain about all of the stupid people on facebook.  People are posting political statuses who have no real knowledge behind any of their convictions, and then the other side argues all of the reasons that they're both stupid.  It sometimes produces a good screenshot, but more often than not, the quality of the conversation is worse than that found in the halls of middle schools around the world.  

What is it that makes reddit better than Facebook in the realm of discussion?  Is it just the anonymous voice that we all get to speak with?  Or is there something more?  Maybe it is the communities that we find.  Someone disgusted with rising consumerism finds [/r/anticonsumption](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption) and finds a group of people that really understand them.  They are more likely to add to the discourse there, than they are to add to the conversation on their old babysitter’s Facebook wall.  



**tl;dr - Anonymity is hard to spell, but contributes to the quality and nature of discussion on reddit.  Your thoughts?**

Sub-reddit's are being created to move one aspect of the community away from the ""main"" sub to other smaller, less viewed subs. 

I moderate my own sub-reddit and have been accused of ""over-moderating"" before but I dont shy away from meme pics, gifs or anything else that is user submitted, what I do that rustles the jimmies of my community is I have rules in place against the posting of leaked episodes or having members of the community post discussion threads and so on as I digress. And I dont mind being called out on that. 

What really makes me scratch my head is how subs like /r/doctorwho and /r/community can really look down upon and essentially ban ""funny"" pics and gifs just because they are the fad of the month on their sub , especially considering that both shows are in the off season and wont be back on for awhile. Isnt any content better than no content? At what point does it get to be people complaining for the sake of complaining when if things are being posted to the sub and you dont like them you either downvote or move on, obviously people like it because they are being upvoted.

And the flip side of this is a sub like /r/skyrim, a quick glimpse at the side bar shows various skyrim related sub-reddits such as:

* /r/skyrimmods 

* /r/skyrimclasses 

* /r/SkyrimPorn 

And the thing is unlike /r/doctorwho and /r/community these sister skyrim subs are all beneficial to the community, imagine having to sort through the entire main sub looking for the best mods or if you want a wallpaper for your computer instead of sifting through terrible resolution screenshots in the main sub they can look at /r/skyrimporn.

/r\/Music is going through another one of their periodic revisions of their ruleset, including fresh consideration of an idea that's been bouncing around the sub for some time now, [the dreaded blacklist](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/10i09p/lets_talk_reposts_again/). The gist there is that certain well-known bands and songs have a tendency to clib to the top of their queue on a semi-regular basis, meaning that the front page on any given day will contain less brand-spanking new or lesser known music than it could—or ideally should. While I sympathize with Raeth's goals there, I can't really see /r\/Music adopting that rule, and even if they did, I think it would end up putting a great deal of pressure on the mods maintaining the blacklist.

What I'd like to see (not necessarily instead) is a new network of subs called ""NewToMe,"" with /r\/NewToMeMusic as the flagship. The premise of the entire network would be that subscribers would (ideally) vote based on the freshness of the content, rather than on their preconceived response to content that they already know. In other words, you vote up on posts that link to music you've not heard before. If you've heard a particular submission before, you either vote it down or don't vote on it at all.

To anticipate the obvious objection—no, you cannot herd cats. There will always be some users who vote according to their own prerogatives. Likewise, there will always be users who vote without considering the sub in which they're voting. The system will not be perfect.

But this layout reflects the ideal of building a community website when it was young and needed page views. Now that Reddit is so well known and attracts so many new users per day, is it time to place more emphasis on respective subreddits' rules?

Some points to consider:
- When a user subscribes to a subreddit, s/he less frequently visits the subreddit's page, instead browsing through the front page of his/her browser/app (and therefore doesn't see the sidebar).
- There's always been an inherent conflict between the establishment of subreddit rules in the sidebar and the enactment of those rules via moderation, since there's such a discrepancy between subreddits for that ratio.

Rather than going through an extensive list of those problems, let's just straight to the recommendations, and I'll cap this post with a quick summary of how I think they'll help.

1. Consolidate and clarify rule sets;

2. Rely more heavily on the various moderation bots provided by industrious users (at least until the admins get around to implementing those functions natively);

3. Reduce the number of moderators in most subs – in some cases, drastically.

The third of those recommendations is the most critical – the other two are there mostly in support. The prevailing theory of moderation over the last several years has been that subs need a large complement of mods, and a veritable phalanx if the sub has a subscribership measured in the tens or hundreds of thousands.

There are two problems with that point of view. One is that large moderator groups tend to be very bad at decision-making. They deliberate interminably over matters of policy when a timely, decisive change is needed; they contradict one another's decisions, leaving the forum in confusion or providing opportunities for witch-hunts. **In nearly every case, a sub would be better served by two or three responsible and active mods making clear-cut decisions and explaining those decisions to the community, rather than a half-dozen or more mods attempting to maintain the cohesiveness of a sub by bureaucracy or committee.**

The second problem is that, for a long time, the advocates of large moderation teams were right: you generally *did* need a dozen or more mods to keep up with the modqueue on a large sub.

That's where recommendations 1 and 2 come in. Moderation bots have automated a lot of the tasks that necessitated a small army of moderators. Clear and concise rules can further reduce the work load on moderators by making it easier for users to understand the boundaries of relevant content and making the task of judging relevance easier for mods.

Whether or not these recommendations are practicable is something we can discuss in the comments, but ultimately what I would like to see is people taking this list of recommendations to the mods of the subs they enjoy. Without visibility, there's unlikely to be any shift in mod philosophy, no matter how reasonable the course I've outlined.

**Background**: People expressed displeasure at amount of facebook posts.  Poll was created and closed relatively shortly.  Poll results were slightly for removal of facebook posts.  The mods then reinstated the poll again asking the same question, reasoning that people didn't have time to vote the first time.  A week passes, and it comes out 51.23% anti-Facebook again.  Moderators declare that they won't remove facebook posts, because ""A 2% margin isn't enough to make such a drastic change.""  The moderators decided against how the majority voted.

The reaction of the subscribers are mostly in approval.

Now let's reverse the situation.  Let's assume that Facebook was already banned, and a poll was put up to unban them, and that the subscribers voted *against* removing facebook posts, twice, and the moderators said ""A 2% margin isn't enough to make such a drastic change."" and declared they would continue to remove facebook posts.  How would reddit react?  Reddit has always seemed a very pro-democracy community.  It seems to me that if the situation were reversed, heads would roll.  

But in this case, people seem content or apathetic about the mods' decision.  Why is this?  How did it happen that the poll resulted in more moderation-approvers than anti-moderation-approvers, but the comments are predominantly anti-moderation?  This seems to be a common theme with these sorts of things.  I can't be the only one to notice this.

Reddit adds the ability for one so inclined to lead the creation of subreddits (other than *that* one) that allow the creator to lock it to Gold Member viewable only.  Taking it one step closer to what SomethingAwful has (psychologically speaking).

The assumption is that a person would purchase a Gold membership to access these ""Gold Only"" subreddits.  Therefore you would *really have to like reddit* or *really want to access that subreddit*, with the desire serving as the incentive to buy.

The goal then, is to filter out the dregs of reddit.  The Gold gateway would filter out newbies (who should at least check out the website before they throw money at it), spammers, users who enjoy meme posts (pending the moderator's rules of the Gold only subreddit).  If a rule is broken, a person could be tagged with strikes, or straight out subreddit banned according to the moderator's rules.

The major drawback: who are active (and or ""good"") posters who cannot afford (or choose not to buy) a gold membership would be the biggest losers in this scenario.

Do you think this would improve or worsen the quality of reddit?

*Welcome to our weekly ""Admin-Level Change"" thought experiment. Each week, an individual /r/TheoryOfReddit moderator will host a discussion about a theoretical changes to reddit's code, infrastructure or official policy that would not be possible for users and moderators to accomplish alone; it would require admin intervention.*

Here is this week's topic:

## How could reddit give users more control over what items appear on their frontpage?

**Discussion**  

We previously spent some time [discussing how reddit could improve its algorithms to generate a better frontpage](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1j0z2r/admin_level_change_thought_experiment_week_04/). Here I'd like to discuss ways that users could directly improve their frontpage experience, by customizing it to their liking. Some ideas to get us started:

* *Pinned subreddits:*

I am personally subscribed to over 200 subreddits - far more than even my Reddit gold subscription allows me to see at once. This means that on any given view of my frontpage, I have less than a 50% chance of seeing any specific subreddits.

Now, I value my subreddits differently. Because it's small, and I moderate it, I'd like to see my university subreddit on my frontpage all the time. Same for other subreddits I moderate, and those that particularly interest me. Others I might find entertaining, but don't need to see every post.

Having the ability to ""pin to frontpage"" would be one way to accomplish this.

* *Multireddit priority:*

But what if we take this one step further? With the introduction of multireddits, we're already categorizing our subreddits. Perhaps we could have an option in the multireddit to choose a priority - ""Pinned"", ""High"", ""Medium"", ""Low"" to affect the frequency of subreddits in that multi making it to our frontpage.

* *Moderator stickies:*

Another aspect of this to consider involves the newly added moderator ""Sticky post"" feature. Right now, it is useful in getting a post to the top of a users page *if they visit the subreddit directly*. Otherwise, it doesn't help with visibility. Having a way to specify ""Please show me all new stickied posts from this subreddit"" would help the reach of those posts, and allow usuers to more directly subscribe to moderator threads (useful, for example, with many tv show discussion threads).

* *How else could this be accomplished?*

This is our weekly admin level discussion thread, so throw out any ideas you have! What would you like to see on your frontpage? Do multireddits do the job for you? Would you like sliders to tune the frequency of each subreddit? Would you like to be able to subscribe directly to /r/friends? Let's hear those ideas!

Here is this week's topic:

##What if the admins changed your privacy options on Reddit?

**Discussion**

In this post we will be focusing on a hot topic in the cultural zeitgeist today. Without a doubt the Reddit community has strong, though somewhat varied opinions about privacy--especially in the digital realm. What we would like to focus on this week are ideas, suggestions, opinions and discussion about admin level actions that relate to your privacy while on reddit. 

You can approach this subject several different ways with this. Privacy is all about give and take. In the U.S. we often give up bits of privacy for all sorts of different reasons. For example, when crimes happen police officers can invade your privacy if a judge agrees they have sufficient evidence that you are to blame. We like privacy, but our society makes exceptions when it is appropriate to do so. Likewise, on Reddit you can hide the information you up and down vote, but not your entire profile. We all have privacy through the use of pseudonyms, however, the majority of your actions on reddit are publicly recorded and can identify a user if they are not careful. 

Should the admins create more tools to further ensure the privacy of the users? If so, what tools should they add? What suggestions would you offer the admins as they wade through this sensitive issue ?

As food for thought, here are a few ideas that have been brought up in the past:

- Anonymous posting without throwaways
- The ability to remove your username from a comment without deleting it
- The ability to completely hide user pages or
- The ability to delete your entire history with one click

Do you support any of these ideas? If so, why?

On the other side of the coin, some may argue that the actions of a user while on Reddit should be less private in order to make this site a better place. Some suggestions related to this include:

- The ability for mods to view the user who reports a submission
- Remove the ability for users to hide up and down votes
- Add native tagging to further identify users like in RES
- Give the mods the ability to natively flag a user with a tag that only the mods could see

Would you support any of these options? How would you defend taking away a little privacy for ""the greater good""? What other thoughts or suggestions might you have in this regard? 

If you would like more information about Reddit's privacy policy you can read the whole thing [here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/privacypolicy). To their credit, the admins do work very hard to keep all of our personally identifiable information private and it is a tireless effort for which I commend them.

1372455203.0,42,self.TheoryOfReddit,1h9w4q,Using Python to simulate the effects of the new queue on Reddit's submission ranking system (pt. 3),blackstar9000,63,21,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1h9w4q/using_python_to_simulate_the_effects_of_the_new/,"This is the third of a series of posts testing the hypothesis that *the structure of the new queue gives a competitive advantage to submissions that link directly to image files*.

[In the second in the series](http://redd.it/1h7r54), I discussed the baseline results of a series of simulations I've been. Those results seemed to point to the conclusion that increasing the rate of submissions (1) does very little to change the distribution of content types on the front page in subs with few active voters, (2) tilt the balance in favor of submissions that require relatively less time to evaluate in the subs with the most active voters, and strangely (3) tilt the balance in favor of more slowly evaluated submissions in subs between those two extremes.

## Why that ain't necessarily so

The baseline tests do a pretty good job of simulating how evaluation time effects front page ranking when all else is equal, but rarely is all else equal. For example, each of the snoos in the simulation evaluate every post they can get to in the allotted time. Among other things, that means they each get caught evaluating long form images at one point or another, which takes them out of the loop for more than 23 minutes of simulation time. Particularly when you crank up the rate of submissions, that means that long form images cast a long shadow, preventing snoos from voting on other types of content altogether, and especially in the new queue where the votes effectively count for more.

In reality, though, not everyone votes on everything that comes through the new queue. They skip posts based on provisional assessments as to whether or not it's the sort of content they're likely to want to see. So the next step was to model that in SnooSim.

To do that, I added an attribute to the evaluator class: vote method. Previously, snoos voted in one of two ways, based on which page they used to view submissions. Snoos on the front page voted up eighty percent of the time and down the rest; those on the new queue alternated between up, down, and none. The new method attribute allowed me to specify that a certain percentage of snoos on each page would vote according to their own specified method.

Unfortunately, those additions made some trials run prohibitively long. A trial involving 44 evaluators and a submission rate of 525 seconds completes in a few minutes, but processing time increases geometrically as you increase either. With the voting methods implemented, trials at the upper end (2,200 snoos and a 50 second rate) took 8-10 hours to complete.

For that reason, most of the data that follows will deal with the midrange number—550 snoos operating mostly in the 200 second range. Since that was the problematic range in our baseline trials, that doesn't seem like much of a compromise. Since I'm relatively new to programming in Python, it's entirely probable that someone more seasoned can figure out a way to optimize the code so that it doesn't take so long at the upper range, so we may yet see this experiment repeated on the full range of possible subs.

## The Quick and the Dead

To make sense of the results of the baseline tests, I divided the content types into two broad groups based on evaluation time: quick-vote submissions and slow-vote submissions. ([That's a distinction I've drawn before](http://redd.it/1fxgwz).) So let's start out by putting them in direct competition. I created two vote methods that allow snoos to skip either category of posts—they still vote according to the default methods within their preferred categories—then ran several permutations to see what rose to the top.

[This first chart](http://i.imgur.com/0jiADPa.png) shows the front page after seven days with the sub divided equally between snoos who vote only on quick-vote submissions and snoos who only vote on slow-vote submissions. If you're having trouble seeing the distribution, I've reordered it by evaluation time in the isolated column on the right. Pretty striking, right? What that means is that, when there's an even division between users who want particular content types, those whose content types take less time to evaluate win outright.

That's a pretty sharp division, though. What about when there's a cohort that wants an even mix of types? [The second chart](http://i.imgur.com/LNcopAA.png) shows day seven in a sub where voting habits are divided into thirds: quick-vote, slow-vote, and snoos who vote on everything that comes down the pike. You can see that the disparity is not as sharp, but the majority of posts still come from the quick end of the spectrum. That's especially notable if, as yesterday's data suggested, subs of that size and level of activity tend to favor slow-vote content when everyone votes the same way.

Let's take it down one more notch. [The third chart](http://i.imgur.com/ZgkLSbX.png) shows day seven with a quarter quick-vote, a quarter slow-vote, and a full half voting on everything. That doesn't change the quick-to-slow ratio all that much, but it does seem to expand the middle range at the expense of the extremes.

So far, the front page snoos have been voting in concert with the new queue snoos, but what if we change that dynamic? [Here's what happens](http://i.imgur.com/eaCiiE8.png) when the knights of the new are evenly divided between preferences for quick and new, while everyone else votes on whatever shows up on the front page: quick-vote content takes over. Pay careful attention to that. It means that *25 people have effectively determined the overall direction of the front page in a sub with several thousand voters.*

But we can amp that up. [Here's what happens](http://i.imgur.com/F40PQ6T.png) when half of the new queue only votes on quick-vote material, while a fifth of the front page only votes on slow-vote material. The quick-vote material still has a decisive edge, even though its 25 partisans are being countered by 100 slow-vote partisans. In part that's just the logarithmic effect of the hot ranking algorithm, but watch what happens when [only the front page is partisan](http://i.imgur.com/bgsMTsd.png). Quick-vote submissions still dominate, because evaluation time matters.

## The Meme Knave

Those tests deal specifically with investment time, dividing voters off into categories depending on their willingness to vote on submissions that require more time to evaluate. What about voters with a narrow-minded focus on a single type of content?

To test that scenario, I created a method whereby some users only vote on familiarity-based images. For the most part, that means memes. Riffing a bit on Hume's ""sensible knave"", I've taken to thinking of those voters as ""meme knaves""—that is, users who benefit from the site's structure at the expense of a majority that's content to see a broader variety of content types.

[Here's what happens to a moderately active sub when a proportion of its active voters start to ignore everything but memes](http://i.imgur.com/UdqMsMv.png). The trend from 10% (i.e. 55 meme knaves) to 25% (i.e. 138 meme knaves) is clear. Even with as few as [10 meme knaves in the new queue](http://i.imgur.com/E0kzTlK.png), memes quickly become the best represented content type on the front page.

## Conclusions

So what does all of that mean? You might recall that our hypothesis was that *the structure of the new queue gives a competitive advantage to submissions that link directly to image files*. It turns out that's not entirely true. Yesterday's results suggest that there might be a slight shift at the extremes of activity, but not enough to explain why some subs have drifted from a varied mix of content types to nearly all images.

Based on this new data, it seems more accurate to say that **the structure of the new queue gives format monists a disproportionate command over the front page**, even when their preference for more briefly evaluated content types reflects a minority stake in the sub. That's especially true as a sub becomes more active and less time is available for any one person to evaluate every submission that comes through.

It would be great if reddit deleted these communities after 6 months of inactivity or something along those lines.

A very good example of this is [r/numbertheory](http://www.reddit.com/r/numbertheory) and I'm sure that any of you could also name a few subreddits that follow this pattern.

So what I propose is a relatively (I think) simple solution. After 3 months of inactivity, reddit sends a message to the creator of a subreddit, telling them to get their act together and start using the subreddit, clearly warning them that they have 3 months left before their subreddit is deleted. 2 weeks before the subreddit is deleted, an automated post is made to it saying that there are 2 weeks left before deletion. This post must get 25 (or another number if that works better) upvotes or else the subreddit will be deleted.

I'm sure you guys could also think of some good standards so if you can think of them, please say them.

tl;dr: Reddit's subreddit policy isn't too great, I think they should improve it and delete unused subreddits.

That's part of my point, people would put more thought into comments if their karma was reflected in an average. Also you could be much prouder of a high average score than the raw score as it shows long-term, positive participation; and it would constantly be decaying, forcing people to continuously re-evaluate how/what they post.

However, I think it's food for thought/discussion enough to serve as an appropriate topic here, evidenced at least partially by the fact that several people replied to the post in the space of an hour. In the original post, the OP wrote:

&gt;This website could have been so great. It breaks my heart that it is so easily gamed.

And so, I ask:

What tool for distributing information to a large group of people can't be gamed? Human beings are pretty good (if I do say so, myself) at taking things they find and repurposing them for other tasks.

One can argue that funneling authority through a small number of individuals can insulate from outside forces, but there are two problems with this: It destroys the collaborative nature of the project, and it is only as safe from corruption as the individuals themselves. History has plenty of examples of corruption when power is placed in the hands of the few.

Reddit splits the difference: Users create and rate the content, and moderators act as curators. Moreover, another safeguard against corruption is that anyone is allowed to make new subreddits and moderate them. We see how this works with the wave of 'true' reddits such as /r/truereddit and related subs. The system is far from unexploitable, as we well know, but it is adaptable.

I've meandered slightly, but the point is that I don't know any way to make reddit less easily gamed via changing the structure of reddit. And it's my opinion that the larger communities (which are, because of the fact, more targeted by advertising) are too big to accommodate a social revolution which makes the communal attitude reject advertising. Sure, the most flagrant of things will be downvoted and/or deleted. But marketers are people too, and will endlessly endeavor to be clever enough to put their advertising under the radar.

I put forth to you two questions:

What structural changes could reddit make to become less susceptible to marketing and other influences? Do you think the reddit system does a good job of preventing external subversion? How do the innovations of reddit make it more or less susceptible to subversion than its predecessors? (To me that means 'standard' internet forums, but there are other lineages.)

Is it possible for social changes of the userbase to significantly alter the susceptibility to advertising and subversion? Do you think that it's inevitable that social structures be gamed?",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,t3_12ixbs,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/12ixbs/advertising_subversion_and_the_repurposing_of/,

I've been sitting on /r/TrueTheoryOfReddit for a while, and after yesterday's new rule announcement, violentacrez found the subreddit and asked if I would be willing to transfer ownership of the subreddit over to him. I agreed.

Despite the fact that violentacrez and I don't often see eye to eye, I respect him tremendously as a moderator. He has done a great service to the NSFW community here on reddit, he is very adamant about freedom of speech, and moderates his subreddits accordingly. While I personally disagree with his laissez-faire style of moderation (I don't think it scales very well at all, see /r/atheism), I do realize that a large portion of the reddit community prefers it, especially in the default subreddits.

This is ultimately why I decided to hand the subreddit over to VA. He is an experienced moderator, and knows how to generate traffic to his subreddits, so I'm sure it's not going to sit idle. His style of moderation is almost completely opposite to mine (although we do share a few similarities), which will provide the yin to this subreddit's yang. Furthermore, there are several influential redditors who used to contribute here, but have since stopped since I took over and drastically changed how this subreddit was moderated. It is my hope that these users will feel more comfortable contributing to a subreddit where VA holds the top moderator position.

Upon seeing his comment he was heavily downvoted.  I then commented about how no one must be reading his whole comment, and since then everyone began upvoting his comment.

Therefore moderators might act in the interest of the subreddit community when they remove submissions popular within their subreddit.

Let's look at the places a submission can theoretically receive votes from:

* From within the subreddit it's posted to.

* From reddit.com (the front page).

* From /r/all.

* From the OP's user page and from /r/friends.

(Did I miss anything, besides multireddits which I ignored?)

Now the question is: Who is most likely to care about the context of a submission?

**\*** I'd say those browsing the subreddit definitely care about the context. If users browsing the subreddit don't care whether a submission is off-topic or not, we should really ask ourselves why we have subreddits in the first place.

One important aspect is that in small and medium size subreddits, a new submission might show up on the subreddit's front page, while in the big subreddits only those looking at /new will see it. If the knights of new vote differently than the average user who's browsing the subreddit, then this matters.

**\*** It gets more interesting in reddit.com. Ignoring the defaults, only users who chose to subscribe to a subreddit can see its submissions here. But let's say a user is subscribed to /r/politics and /r/worldpolitics, would it matter to him whether a submission was posted to /r/politics or /r/worldpolitics? Maybe not.

Another interesting aspect is that reddit.com is the only place where subreddits are weighted. This means that the smaller a subreddit, the fewer votes it needs for a submission to show up on the front page of those users who are subscribed to it. New submissions from very small subreddits might directly make it to the front page of reddit.com.

**\*** Let's say users browsing /r/all don't care about context. I think that's a safe bet. But does it matter? Only submissions that already have a ton of upvotes make it there. Of course there's /r/all/new, but does it really matter? Right now America is asleep and I still counted more than 20 submissions / minute. Probably the new queue there moves way too fast to really make a difference.

**\*** User pages are very interesting. I doubt that too many users browse them, but as submissions are sorted by new there by default, a few votes might still make a difference.

My implicit assumption is that the early votes decide on the fate of a submission, that's why I put my focus there.

While it's hard to come up with an answer without any hard data, it might explain a lot of what's going right and wrong and might be important when thinking about Reddit's future.

Personally I think that the front page (reddit.com) is where out of context votes are a problem. Votes from within a subreddit will mostly take the context into consideration, while votes in /r/all don't matter much. Weighing subreddits by their activity might be counter productive, as submissions to non default subreddits might get a lot of early votes from reddit.com rather than from within the community.",,False,,t5_2rtff,True,,,True,t3_kjfo0,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/kjfo0/where_do_the_votes_come_from/,

Currently, there is a growing movement within /r/anarchism to remove the current moderators from their position.  Many within the community believe the mods have been abusive of their power, as documented [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/metanarchism/comments/j4wfe/everybody_thinks_were_a_joke_because_of_the_mods/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/j5e3d/hey_guys_i_hear_its_easy_to_get_banned_here_is_it/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/metanarchism/comments/j53qj/proposal_forced_demodding_of_anarchism_through/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/metanarchism/comments/j3cfx/warn_or_ban_lady_catherine_for_joking_about/), and elsewhere ... seriously, it's easy to find.

A [RedditRequest has been made](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/j5has/force_all_the_mods_out_of_power_in_) to oust the mods in line with a [referendum](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/e6quu/referendum_on_moderators_vote_updown_here/) 8 months ago -- which is the top-voted submission in that subreddit.  However, those in charge refuse to step down. 

In response, the community has attempted to move to a different subreddit, but this has been met with varying degrees of success, in part because numerous alternatives have been created.  Some of these have been around for months, some only for a few days.  While it is not unheard of for a whole community to move (see /weed to /trees), it is difficult to do and those involved in /anarchism have no real wish to change that name, unlike /trees which seemed to like the name change.

*Anyhow*, /RedditRequest has, until now, been a place for people to appeal bans or gain moderatorship of unused subreddits, which I would consider fairly minor actions.  The latest request on behalf of /anarchism is in contrast fairly major: to remove all 23 moderators.  Given the community's support of this, is this an action /Redditrequest should take?

Why is karma-whoring a bad thing? As I understand it, karma is a reward/punitive measure for submitting things that Redditors find interesting. If someone is motivated by this, they may post lots of links to things that Redditors find interesting. Why is this a bad thing?

I can see some kind of general arguments about it: for example, karma-whoring can be used to create an environment in which certain viewpoints are stifled. The problem is that this is a natural result of karma, and couldn't really be solved without either more robust personal filters or the elimination or devaluation of karma.

More than just an argument on why nothing is wrong with karma-whoring, I'm genuinely puzzled at how Reddit can support the public distaste for it. How can there be ""karma-whoring"" right on the front page next to posts bitching about karma-whoring?

But this tells me nothing about how many people *view* comments.

For example: I posted http://thisiswhatblogspamlookslike.wordpress.com to illustrate what ""blogspam"" is, since some users have taken the term ""blogspam"" to mean *any* selfposting/promotion of blogs *at all*, even though it specifically refers to click-through blogs.

This link was in a comment that got, I'd say, 100-200 comment karma. I don't remember exactly how much, but I remember it being in that range. According to wordpress, it got 4500 hits from that comment. So that would be somewhere between 20 and 40 views for every comment karma point, basically.

This was also in a defaultesque subreddit, so take that into consideration.

On the other hand, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1bzfhg/i_got_sick_of_feminism_just_means_youre_for/) did fairly well (+130) but got 3,300 views. That's confirming the 20-40 estimate but links *should* be viewed more than comments, since presumably people click the link *before* viewing the comments given that the headline was what interested you in the first place. Though there's also a contingent that clicks the comments *before* the links -- people on news/politics subreddits who are used to sensationalist headlines and feel that comment sections ""cut through the bullshit.""

I suspect that when you're on a main page and not the comment jungle (i.e. you don't have to click ""continue"") the 20-40 estimate will hold true, but presumably as you go further from that the number of people who have read anything you're saying plummets.

This would severely change the game, if true. This would mean that powerusers with 100,000 comment karma have between 2 and 4 million views of their comments. That's pretty enormous for text-based views.

But then, companies *pay people* to post on reddit (astroturfing), so if someone is willing to pay money for reddit influence I'm sure someone has done the math and made a solid case that reddit comment presence is influential.

One way that smaller subreddits combat this is by using aggressive moderation. With the help of encouraging users to report unwanted posts and comments, /r/MorbidReality has kept a good community with a specific purpose for a long time. However, as its userbase grows, it loses some control over quality.

For example, a while back, [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/1ednv3/looking_for_an_articlewebpage/c9z9ulb) wouldn't be acceptable.  
&gt; So you're looking for a description of underage girl rape and your name is CardiacMolest...  
&gt; I kid. No idea about the article though good luck.  

However, right now it's the most upvoted comment on that thread (even though it's a small and relatively new thread).

Even if the old userbase would be against a username joke, as new users come in, their voice might drop to 80% to 50% and down to that of a small minority. Once this happens, it's up to the mods to delete the post, or for the new users to somehow be educated about standards. Regarding education, users can generally bring themselves up-to-date by just browsing a subreddit for a while. Alternatively, there are rules on the sidebar. However, we see that this isn't enough since large subreddits still degrade.

So, in addition to that, the subreddit gets threads like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/1eg6rw/i_feel_like_the_maturity_level_of_this_subreddit/) to talk about the trend. However, a lot of the comments on these threads seem to disagree with the premise and get annoyed by the threads. As the number of users that dislike these 'reminder/education/discussion' threads increases, the less effective and more ignored they will be.

So how do we combat this and keep a subreddit's purpose specific? If a subreddit can be split to different subreddits (/r/gore, /r/watchpeopledie, ...) then that helps, but that isn't always an option, because sometimes a subreddit is about as specific as it needs to be. I guess another option is to use the /r/TrueReddit style subreddits.

However, I think there is value in the idea of trying to educate users to grow a community, rather than letting it degrade. There are subreddits that I think do a great job of it, but they are smaller than /r/MorbidReality so I can't prove that it works for subreddits past a certain size.

The easy reaction is ""look at the conspiratards who think this must have been arranged in secret by the U.S. military! ho ho ho"" but frankly they don't even surprise me any more. What did astonish me was the equal viciousness of personal attacks in the other direction - against people who refuse to support the soldiers any more than they support the wars. Basically, it's not so much that reddit was overrun by trolls with an anti-soldier agenda, but more generally that the welfare of American servicemen turned out to be much more *divisive*, overall, than the admins anticipated - there are very strong feelings on both sides.

One way of reading this is, **did the admins confuse the internet with American television?** If you've lived in the U.S. for a while, you may have noticed that immediately after September 2001, a new ""Support Our Troops"" meme spread like wildfire throughout the mainstream media. Even now, Stephen Colbert gets reliably unironic when he speaks about giving financial or verbal support to his country's armed forces. It's basically been treated as a totally nonpartisan good cause that everyone can agree on, even if they oppose the wars. So you can see why someone in that culture might think it's a great idea for a charity drive that won't offend anyone.

Obviously that sentiment doesn't apply on reddit. So my question for ToR is, **is reddit's culture so vastly different from mainstream America because of the different medium, or just because so many redditors aren't American?**

The internet often goes a different way from pop culture, and we hope it's because the user-submitted content format means ideas can come from anywhere and gain support by their quality, rather than just being whatever large corporations consider appropriate for the audience. Examples of differences between internet culture and mainstream culture might include atheism, drug legalization, Ron Paul, and cats - most of the viewpoints expressed on the internet about these issues are hard to imagine hearing on American TV news, even in the context of a debate.

Or, maybe it's just all those citizens of the Rest Of The World who are constantly dealing with Americocentrism on the English-speaking internet, and what could be a more nationalistic finger in the eye than asking for donations to support another country's soldiers overseas. Some comments in the thread do express that concern. But my interpretation of the rest is that it doesn't seem like anyone but Americans could scream quite as strongly as many of those commenters do about American politics, even when American politics involves blowing up people outside America.

I dunno. What do you guys think?

Not mentioning the fact that millions of Redditors just got extremely excited over a chance meeting over a social news aggregate site. The thing that caught me was the fact that she gave an **acceptance** speech, with shout-outs and all. 

What does TOR think about this? Is a chance, but highly probable encounter on a site predominately frequented by college physics students really worth an acceptance speech?

First, I'd like to explain something.  I KNOW karma is supposed to be earned.  The point of this reddit, at least for me, is more of an experiment than just a karma whoring pyramid scheme thingy.  The thing is, karma is produced.  It doesn't change hands, like money does.  So we can easily just produce it with this system.

What the experiment is trying to see is, what's the best system of reward on reddit?  Apparently the current system won't work, because as shown by this, karma can easily be produced with no effort, earning a reward for nothing.  The 'real world' uses currency, which changes hands.  If this applied in reddit, you would have to give up and upvote to vote something up.  I really hope that doesn't happen on reddit, since that would obviously suck.

Basically, don't hate me.  The reddit isn't even working, there are too few members to produce a large amount of votes.  

Does anyone else find this interesting?!  What would the best form of reward be?

(Appropriately enough, the section is titled serendipity.)

For some reason this connected back to me in that I felt like reddit had become a bit of an echochamber for me, and I was looking for a way to passively inject more randomness into my reddit experience. So I made this bot-run subreddit, which picks a top link from a random subreddit (with at least 1000 subscribers) and posts it every 3 hours. I subscribe, and then every once in a while something completely unexpected (good or bad) will show up in my list.

It's been fantastically helpful for me in growing out the breadth of value I receive from reddit.

Or do I have the wrong standards for what constitutes a repost (e.g. if it is 3 years since the last repost is that ok?). Or do people just hate a buzzkill?

&gt;It is fashionable to suggest that cyber-space is some island of the blessed where people are free to indulge and express their individuality, this is not true. I have seen many people spill out their emotions - their guts - online and I did so myself until I began to see that I had commodified myself.

&gt;Commodification means that you turn something into a product which has a money value. In the 19th Century, commodities were made in factories, by workers who were mostly exploited. But I created my interior thoughts as commodities for the corporations that owned the board I was posting to - like Compuserve or AOL - and that commodity was sold onto other consumer entities as entertainment.

&gt;Cyber-space, is a Black Hole; it absorbs energy and personality and then re-presents it, as an emotional spectacle. It is done by businesses that commodify human interaction and emotion - and we are getting lost in the spectacle

and his own thesis:

&gt; On Facebook and Twitter, you are performing to attract people - you are dancing emotionally, on a platform created by a large corporation. People’s feelings bounce back and forth - happy Stakhanovites, ignoring and denying the system of power

A lot of people call karma a useless measure or a pissing contest here, but is it perhaps a measure of how valuable we are as users to Reddit as a company rather than a community? Controversial users that have been varyingly accused of using sockpuppets or trolling accounts that an admin could easily expose or investigate are seemingly tolerated because of their high karma cache. While the users see karma as a useless metric, is it's real value to measure how much user contributions have been commodified?

- In that period, 11 months of reddit gold were given, so 1.375/day, or a rate of just over 40 per month.

- In the 7 days preceding that (the 6th through the 12th), 2 were given out.

- In the 7 days preceding that (May 30th through the 5th), 7 were given out.

- In the 7 days preceding that, (May 23rd through 29th), 5 were given out.

None were gilded more than once or with more than one month of reddit gold.

While there's some level of variance in the preceding weeks, there's definitely been an increase since then. Let's round up and take the median instead of the mean and say there would be 5 gilds per week on average long-term without this change, or (just over) 20 per month. That indicates that this has doubled the level of gilding, increasing monthly revenue for reddit.com by a modest but not-negligible $80.

One question I think this study raises is how the factor of /r/news being so high-variance in traffic factors in. When our traffic increases, naturally gilding does too, and that factor could decrease the relative (or possibly even the net) effect this change has. Or it could multiply it. We'll have to wait until the next big traffic spike to see.

Another is how much having more moderators do this (or reddit's admins putting this in the default CSS) would increase gilding cumulatively. It's hard for me to estimate what percentage of reddit's comment-reading is done in /r/news. The data on [stattit.com](http://stattit.com/r/news/) could help with that but I haven't set out on the task of trying (yet).

I did this because I thought it would be an interesting experiment and because I thought that, with reddit currently being unprofitable, it wouldn't hurt to help its revenue out a bit in a way that isn't ugly or distracting for the subreddit's users. I have no plans to remove it and would be happy to report back with more data after we've had it for longer.

It seems to me that in general leasing some of the work of finding ways to monetize reddit out to the moderators, who have close contact with their unique communities, is a compelling prospect.

I noticed [various subreddit mods](http://i.imgur.com/f5gTmZD.png) started to use it for their profiles. However, this solution clearly isn't universal enough as it is limited to moderators.

One project to introduce a standardized and universal wiki-based solution to user pages is [userpage.reddit.com](http://userpage.reddit.com), where all redditors could have their own user page at http://userpage.reddit.com/w/username.

The shorthanded subreddit notation makes userpage URLs easy enough to remember so that it has hope to become an unofficial standard.

Critical and logical debates are rarely seen in comments.  It's normally emotionally fueled arguments or back patting and agreeing.

Why both of those are bad in excess:

* 1.) Once emotions come into any sort of debate, it's pointless.  Feelings blind logic, and logic is necessary for controlled argument.  There is literally no point in discussing a subject once your emotions start to take over what you're saying.  It's good to be passionate about a subject, but not emotional.

1309146334.0,38,self.TheoryOfReddit,ia0r5,Why Shorter is Better,alexanderwales,49,11,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/ia0r5/why_shorter_is_better/,"This is a theory that I've had for awhile, and it's one that I believe to be shared by a number of people.  In short form, the theory is ""Shorter content gets more upvotes than longer content"".  In long form:

Let's imagine a hypothetical subreddit devoted to widgets, populated by three distinct groups, who all want to share it.  The first group exclusively submits, reads, and votes on content which can be consumed in ten seconds.  The second group is similar, but their content takes about two minutes to get through.  Lastly, the third group favors content which takes at least a half-hour.  For simplicity, these three groups never vote on each others' content.  Also for simplicity's sake, we'll assume that they all have equal populations.

If ten pieces of content are submitted to each of the three groups, what would we expect to happen?  For group one, the shortest amount of time that it would take for a single member to read and vote on all of them is a hundred seconds.  For group two, twenty minutes, and for group three, five hours.  Because of the way ""hot"" ranking works^\*, this means that the frontpage of /r/widgets will at first be dominated by the ""fast"" group, with ""medium"" and ""long"" groups eventually moving into place once the entire population of the subreddit has finished voting.  This would be fine if we were creating a ""best of"" list, because it would mean that eventually everything would settle into place.

However, reddit is not so static.  People are continually submitting content, and continually upvoting.  If /r/widgets were small, this might not be such a problem; a short piece of content might move to the top faster, but eventually the medium and short pieces would catch up.  However, in a fast moving subreddit, or in the context of many other subreddits, this is not the case, primarily due to visibility.  Since we read top to bottom, the very top story on a page is the most likely to get read, and thus most likely to get upvoted, so that if you start with a lead (over other content with the same post date), you'll tend to keep it.  Another visibility barrier is being off-screen; most setups will only show ten or so stories at a time, while mobile devices are limited to five or six.  And of course people are much less likely to read something if it's not on the first page.  Similarly, while mixing together subreddits does account for *size*, it doesn't account for *activity*.  So if you have two subreddits of the same size, the one with shorter content will be listed higher than the one with longer content.

All this is said while putting aside the other competitive advantages that short content tends to have, which I will now cover for the sake of completeness.

 * People tend to have short attention spans, which means that they're more likely to want to look at shorter content - this means that the size of the ""short content"" group tends to be larger than the ""long content"" group in any given subreddit.

 * Short content is better able to appeal to the lowest common denominator.  A five page opinion piece almost by necessity will have a nuanced view, while a picture will have (at most) a bumper sticker slogan.  Similarly, a twenty page research paper will be understandable by only a small minority, while almost everyone will be able to understand a ""blogspam"" post about that paper.  Shorter means simpler, and that means a wider appeal.

 * The initial dominance of short content creates a feedback loop.  More images (for example) on the front-page will attract people who like images and repulse people who don't like images, which results in more images on the front-page.  Note that this is true for pretty much any content type, but because shorter content has an edge over longer content even when all else is equal, the feedback loop gets a jumpstart.

 * Thumbnails give a huge advantage to images, while being able to expand self posts without opening a new tab gives them an advantage.  This is exacerbated by extensions like RES which allow images to be viewed without opening new tabs.

The question that naturally follows is, ""What was different about reddit in the early days?""  We can all agree that in the early days, reddit was a different beast.  I think that there are a number of different factors which have led to the change.  The simplest answer is that the userbase has grown much larger since then, which (as shown above) will tend to favor shorter content, even without a change in the make-up of the userbase, though most people will tell you that this has happened.  The second part of that would be the above mentioned feedback effect.  Since reddit displays the ten largest subreddits to new users, new users are first being exposed to the subreddits which are most heavily affected by the bias towards short content, which further skews the userbase.

This is intended mostly as a reference, so that when someone says that reddit favors shorter content, it isn't just ""common knowledge"" but has at least some logic to back that statement up.  If you have more to add to this, let me know, and I'll edit it in - I've long thought that /r/TheoryOfReddit needs something like an FAQ section so that we can start constructing an actual corpus of knowledge (rather than talking about things without the aim towards ordering that knowledge).

\*""Hot"" ranking is a decay over time function.  This means that stories with the same number of upvotes and downvotes will be sorted by post date, with the most recent being first.  For stories with the same post date, the one with a higher total of upvotes (once downvotes are subtracted) will be first.

It was (is) a forum dedicated to the aviation career track. Al the users there are either working as professional pilots, or are working towards a career in piloting.

When I first joined that community in 2006, I was training to be a professional pilot. It was an enormous resource. There was so much great information posted from people who had way more knowledge than me. I remember spending hours upon hours reading through old threads and learning so much.

That was back when the JetCareers community was still growing. The site launched, I think in 2005 (one year prior). I was an active member there for the next few years. As I progressed in my aviation career, I continued to use the site to give back some insights I had leaned, as well as to engage the community in issues that I felt needed attention.

Sometime around 2007 I stopped using that community. It had really changed. I was no longer useful to me. Here is what happened:

First off, when I first started posting, the site was still growing, and there was no real core ""community"" so to speak of. There were no ""regulars"". In the early days, you didn't even pay attention to the name associated with the post because it was assumed that everyone was on the same level, knowledge-wise.

But as time went on, a certain group of people (maybe 10 or 15 individuals) started to rise above the rest of the users. These people would post in every. Single. Thread. Multiple times. It got to the point where 80% of all posts were made by these 10 or 15 people.

That core group of people weren't even the most knowledgeable. They were, for the most part, young and inexperienced. They were the ones who got the most out of being a member there. Anyone who disagreed with the ""core group"" were treated disrespectfully and marginalized. The read problem was that there was a strong connection between this forum and real life. Many people had made friends with other pilots on that site, and that friendship resulted in real job opportunities. So becoming part of the ""in group"" became extremely desirable.

By 2008 the site was completely and utterly useless for the purpose of learning about aviation. The community had become a circle-jerk to the extreme. Back in those days, you'd click on a thread, and it would be filled with nothing but inside jokes and ""in talk"" between members. ""Hey bill, how are things up in Buffalo. Do you like your new job"", ""Oh yeah I love it, It's great, say hi to Tammy for me"" -- That kind of thing. If you were an insider, this kind of chatter appeals to you. If you're just there to read about aviation, it was frustrating.

Some people want to learn. Some people want to belong. Reddit was founded by people who, for the most part, wanted to learn. Now its mostly populated by people who just want to belong. I think the thing that killed JetCareers the most was the fact that the moderation and admin staff were at the center of the circle jerk. The admin of the site had like a postcount of 40,000 (~50 posts per day, iirc). Everyone agreed with him. He was an airline pilot at Delta, and he was known to recommend his friends from that forum for job openings when they came up.

The life cycle of internet communities:

1. Community is founded
2. Community thrives by fostering great intellectual discussions by attracting the right type of person (this step is mostly driven by luck)
3. Community develops a reputation of being the ""place to be""
4. Said reputation attracts users who want to be ""where it is"", but don't have the experience or knowledge to maintain the community's status of ""place to be"". Sort of like the people who go on American Idol. They want to be music stars, but don't have the skills to actually be a music star. They think by auditioning for the show they'll get their big break.
5. Community changes from ""awesome community to learn"" to ""awesome community to be popular and accepted into""
6. No one cares about the discussion anymore, they only care about karma points and things like that.

Things that reddit does right:

1. Things are fairly anonymous. You can make sock puppet accounts. Your real life name is separate from your ""reddit life"".
2. Moderators stay in the background. Places where moderators are front and center (Something Awful) have the problem where is a bad apple moderator badly effects the community because people take after bad moderators. Everybody wants power and acceptance. Its part of human nature. If the mod is an ashole, the users will be assholes too.
3. Allows meta discussion. Most shitty forums forbid discussion about why the forum has become shitty. Something Awful used to famously ban anyone who dared criticize any moderation decision. Thank god reddit doesn't do that.

Things reddit does wrong:

1. Karma points. People will posts just to get the karma, not to being any new ideas to the table.
2. Default subreddits are the shittiest, useless, communities that only turn great users away. I think reddit should do away with the concept of default subreddits. New users should be subscribed to a random set of ""approved"" subreddits.

Thats it. I think reddit does a pretty good job of managing communities. Reddit isn't perfect, but just like how we (as a civilization) had to get through monarchy, communism, socialism to get to democracy, we'll have to go through many different ""internet discussion government techniques"" to arrive to a system that is nearly perfect.

After spending a lot of time on reddit, I have gone through several phases with how I feel about the value of the content. At it's  best, I see reddit as a place for a free exchange of ideas, sometimes this happens, but more often than not, discussions degenerate into childish name calling or dick measuring. I started thinking, what unique value does Reddit offer, if any. Further, how can we quantify this value in each subreddit. 

So my question is this; if you were to develop a metric for evaluating the health of a community, what would it include? Here are some of my ideas, I would like to ideally place this metric into use and grade different subs. Here are some of my ideas:

* How many other subreddits link to it in its content
* How many extended commenting threads include derogatory key terms
* How often is material reposted
* How is reposted material voted on
* How many mods do they have per users, and how often do they intervene/how active are they
* How many comments per .self posts

I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas, I want to steer away from the traditional voting scheme, as I do not feel like that accurately address the question.

See [Internet Study Finds the Persuasive Power of ‘Like’](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/science/internet-study-finds-the-persuasive-power-of-like.html?hp&amp;_r=0) in today's New York Times

Or the article in Science here (paywall, I think):  

[Muchnik L, Aral S, Taylor SJ, Social Influence Bias: A Randomized Experiment, *Science* 9 August 2013: Vol. 341 no. 6146 pp. 647-651
DOI: 10.1126/science.1240466](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6146/647.abstract)

In brief, researchers found (from editors summary on Science):
&gt;Data were collected and analyzed after the Web site administrators arbitrarily voted positively or negatively (or not at all) as the first comment on more than 100,000 posts. False positive entries led to inflated subsequent scores, whereas false negative initial votes had small long-term effects. Both the topic being commented upon and the relationship between the poster and commenter were important. 

This was done over 5 months using a sample of 101,281 randomly chosen comments (not generated by experimenters).

Basically, if this placed in reddit terms (due to user privacy concerns and legal obstacles, the raw data and name of the website were not released per the website admin's request)...

1. A comment that appears to be positively received, i.e. (2|0) is 32% more likely to get an upvote than the control group, despite being arbitrarily assigned to a positive/negative/neutral group (no impact of comment quality). Positive herding accumulates over time for final mean score 25% higher than comments assigned to the neutral (1|0) group.
2. There was a significant correction effect on comments that appeared to be negatively received, i.e. (1|1) with subsequent users more likely (82%) to bring it back up to zero than to upvote a neutral (1|0) comment (28%). 
3. There was no significant long term difference in the final mean score of a downvoted vs. neutral comment.
4. A comment with an apparent vote on it (2|0) or (1|1) is more likely to receive a second vote (positive herding or correction) as it seems to draw attention to those comments (speculative by authors)
5. People are more likely to upvote ""friends"" who have a positive RES score next to their name versus ""enemies"". This was also an interacting variable with whether the score was positive, neutral or negative to begin with. Probability of upvoting a friend's upvoted comment (0.12) to ""correct"" a friend's downvoted comment (0.17) to upvote a neutral comment by a non-friend (0.09)

Perhaps none of this is very surprising to readers of this subreddit, but it is fascinating (to me) to see some actual experimentation and real statistics. What do you guys think? (note: if the website in question is not reddit, trends are probably consistent, but some details and specifics may not be quite accurate)

For many people, this is their view of Reddit, as a link aggregator with some interpretation.

However, over time I have drifted into another view of Reddit, which is completely inner-directed.

There is a collection of subs forming some kind of unholy trinity, namely ShitRedditSays, SubredditDrama and antiSRS.  Actually, it's not really a trinity, because TheoryOfReddit fits into the same category.

These subs are different from the usual Reddit sub because they are completely inner-directed, posting only links to content which already exists on Reddit, and writing about this content.  Because of the self-referential nature of this material, a single thread can create linked lists of submissions several layers deep.

Because the linking of outside material almost never happens on these subs, *all* of the content is user-generated, and all of the drama is virtual, as it happens only within Reddit.  Because doxxing is disallowed, all of this content is completely unverifiable.

This leaves a situation where almost nothing can be assigned a truth value.  It is *all* uncertain.

As trolls gain more experience, their wild stories will become more and more convincing. As people spend more and more time in these subs, their connection to real stories in the outside world may become more and more tenuous.

For those who experienced the sisterofblackvisions troll, in which the suicide of a Reddit poster was faked, one reason that this was so shocking was that it suddenly *did* bring the outside world into this virtual world in a viscerally shocking way.  However, when it was revealed to be a deception, the whole horrible situation imploded in on itself, with the whole experience being shown to have existed only on Reddit after all (except for the death of one real human being, who remains unknown).


I just find this a fascinating situation to contemplate ... hundreds of human beings communicating with each other, yet never having any certainty about *anything* they read, and none of it relating to events in the real world.

What I am asking is, what is it called when popularity begets popularity? Particularly when much of that popularity is due to a media feedback-loop that promotes what is already popular?


So, when you go on Youtube, the first thing you see are ""Top videos,"" which generates more traffic to the videos already at the top. When you come on Reddit, on the front page are a small number of links that have been upvoted thousands of times. Meaning that which is already popular is going to become more popular on account of its popularity. Music stations will play the top 10 songs because they are in the top 10. In a sense this related to group think, seeing ""Oh, so many people like this, so it must be good, so I will like it too."" But it reaches a point where it is promoted by the media, so that the ""popular video"" becomes kind of self-fulfilling, so that one video link can be seen 5 times, while another is viewed 500,000 times.

I didn't know Reddit tripled in size, which explains why there's been very little stability as the influx of new users voting outpaced the old guard maintaining traditions. 

This is obviously addressing the increase in mod drama. Interesting to see that most of the ideas they're working on has been brought up here before. I appreciate that the post makes sure to defend moderators, hopefully deflecting all the rage they've accumulated recently.

This line might draw some heat:

&gt;We deeply respect the role moderators play in their communities, and we don't use admin ability to override that unless it is absolutely necessary.

Depending on how you feel about VA's dustup, you could strongly disagree with their definition of ""absolutely necessary.""

Also, I am especially wary of:

&gt;allowing moderators to make decisions more democratically.

Of course, it's too soon to say anything about this, but personally I am against giving the crowd any more leverage over the moderators. After all, the mods can already request feedback from the community to do things democratically if they wish.

Whatever I chose, I need to be able to collect data in a feasible way. **I will deliver results of the study by the end of next semester for all to see**.

1. Dedication. the fringe of [/r/ronpaul](/r/ronpaul) are actively following EPS users around and are downvoting them. 

2. Conspiracy. The mods can see that this bot is real, and works. They need more time to stop the bot. They can't admit that this bot is working because it will encourage more users to use the bot. 

3. Coincidence. These people just make shitty posts lately.
