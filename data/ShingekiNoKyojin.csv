First off, he's taller, smarter, much more handsome, and could take him in a fight, but on top of that, Jean has so much depth to his character. His eyes are so deep and dreamy that it's amazing that Mikasa has been able to keep herself off him until now. But she obviously just hasn't noticed she's in love with ~~me~~ him yet. He has that effect on women. Eren on the other hand, who is a butt, wouldn't know romance if it slapped him in the face. He is also a whiny bastard and a complete moron.

It's only been 17 days since the subreddit reached 1000 subscribers. In less than a month, the subreddit doubled in size! AGAIN!

It really is amazing how well received the anime is all over the world. And I believe that after episode 5, the manga sales of almost all volumes reached the top 50 charts in Japan and they stayed there for a good couple of weeks. I can't really blame them. This series has been on point with their cliffhangers. I can only imagine how the first few people that was following the series from chapter felt. 

Anyways, now that the subreddit is growing rapidly, I added a few moderators to help me moderate the sub and make the sub better looking and better fit for the series.

We have /u/F_G_E_S , /u/FlyingGoatee, and /u/Irf00 . These guys are some of the people that has helped in the past with fixing up the subreddit and keeping things neat. They will also help out with CSS stuff so expect to see some improvements with the looks and feel of things here.

In the next few days, expect certain Subreddit Discussion threads to come out such as:

- Flair requests / suggestions

- Make our subreddit snoo. :3

- New subreddit rules just to keep things in check.

Right now, /u/FlyingGoatee is in the middle of fixing us up with a good amount of flairs so expect to see them very soon. (It will be announced in the announcement bar.)

Well, that's going to be it for now. If you guys have any anything you want to suggest please don't hesitate to post them down below and we'll try to accommodate them or at least have a thorough discussion on it.

To all the new Titan Food, **WELCOME!!!**. And to everyone who has been here for a while, keep up the great work. This subreddit wouldn't be as clean or as fun without you. ;)

Thanks!  &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

In **only 19 days**, we have gained another thousand people. At this rate, we can break 10k easily before the end of the year. Insane!

Thanks to everyone who are doing their best to help keep the subreddit as clean as possible! It's hard to keep track of people posting spoilers, sometimes. Reporting them is a definite way of it being flagged or deleted if no action was taken.

A big shoutout as well to the other mods. /u/F_G_E_S , /u/FlyingGoatee and /u/Irf00 have been really helpful in implementing some helpful changes in the subreddit! The subreddit right now isn't overly packed of SnK themed stuff but for now, it might be for the best. (Unless many says otherwise.)

==

**NEW SNOO!!!**

So today, we put up our new snoo! Congratulaitons to /u/viazu for making a snoo design loved by many and fits the subreddit very nicely. You will get a special Tag besides your name to show off your contribution. :)

1376000348.0,32,self.ShingekiNoKyojin,1jzjbr,[Manga spoilers] Source of the Titan's energy,Slender_Mann,36,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1jzjbr/manga_spoilers_source_of_the_titans_energy/,"I was an anime and printed-manga reader (so up until volume 5) until last night and I caved in and read the manga up until the latest chapter. I've been going through the subreddit and thought I'd specifically bring up the titans' energy (although I'm sure a lot of you noticed this, I haven't seen it addressed other than in comments a couple times).

[In this thread on another new reader's questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1jp5d5/just_read_through_the_manga_some_questions/), [this post was made about energy](http://i.imgur.com/WRtfRRT.png).

Basically, there's 2 kinds of modes titans can be in (although we've only seen 2 in the shifters, but they may be able to have the second mode BECAUSE they're shifters [covered below]):

**1- Titan instincts - We see this in the behavior of regular titans and Eren early on (boulder-placing scene)**

* Note on Eren: He may have had his issues because he didn't know how to control his titan(s) yet whereas the rest of the shifters (Annie, Bert, Reiner, Ymir) seem to have control since they come from some village of shifters [citation needed]

**2- Human instincts - This is seen in the shifters. All of the shifters (and eventually Eren) are able to control their titans while retaining their human intellect and focus. They don't have inane desires to eat humans while in this mode.**


[Here](http://www.mangareader.net/shingeki-no-kyojin/46/16), Ymir is questioning Reiner's suggestion to rest until nightfall so the titans won't be active. Reiner replies: These titans can't move at night. You should have already know that. Ymir.""

2 things:

1. There is a clear distinction between titans. There is 1 type that can move at night and another that cannot and Reiner clearly knows that distinction (He knows what's different about the titans attacking the castle at night and the titans that invaded the walls in the beginning of the manga).

2. Ymir also knows (or SHOULD) this distinction.

And here is where I bring up my contention that was brought up in the post I linked above:

 * As long as you have enough energy to maintain your titan form, you can return to your human form

 * If you run completely out of energy, you kick into titan-instinct mode until you have the energy to return to human form.

We have a problem though: What about Ymir? Ymir spent 60 years as a titan. (Before we go further, I want to state how I've interpreted her past: Until 60 years ago, she lived a normal human life and may or may not have had the ability to turn into a titan. 60 years ago, she transformed into a titan and for some reason did not turn back. She spent 60 years as a titan and finally turned back into a human while not aging a day).

What defines a normal titan? Eating humans. Remember that during training, they're taught that the titans do not poop/pee and gain no energy from eating, do not eat anything else, and can go indefinitely on sun energy.

Here's what I think this means for the titans: They can survive virtually forever as long as they get sunlight (they will go dormant in prolonged absence such as the titans in the wall). Eating humans for the sake of killing them is too mindless so I think we can rule this out. Titans eat humans because they're instincts tell them to. Their instincts tell them to eat humans because there's some way they can regain human form (or regain ability to regain human form) by eating certain humans. Since we only know of 2 humans (regular humans and shifting humans), I'm going to assume that if a titan eats a shifter, they'll be able to transform back into a human.

I'm also going to assume Monkey Trouble has some knowledge on this such as alternate ways of transforming INTO and OUT OF titan form.


**tl;dr Titans eat humans because they are looking for specific humans (shifters) in order to transform back into their human form and they're doing this out of pure, unintelligent instinct**


* Alternate theory: ""Yeah, the way Eren's transformation went goes against, for the most part at least, the idea that it's energy-based.
I did also read a theory that instead of being energy-based, once you psychological lose it (losing your mind so to speak), you start merging. Apparently the fight between Eren and Annie showed this in that after Annie kicked Eren's head off and he was out of energy, Eren was COVERED in flesh binding him to his titan and it was close to covering his whole face. Other times we see the human in the titan, it doesn't look nearly as covering as it did then.
Basically, the more psychologically worn out you are, the more you fuse with the body and once you lose your mind, you BECOME the titan and give in to titan instinct.""",Manga Spoilers,True,nsfw,t5_2we2n,1376019909.0,g,crab38,True,t3_1jzjbr,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1jzjbr/manga_spoilers_source_of_the_titans_energy/,

Congratulations to us all for finding our way here and joining together to celebrate a series that we all truly enjoy and love!

I have never seen a community grow so big this fast! And there are still hundreds and thousands out there that are also passionate about the series!

Everyone in this subreddit is awesome! So many Legionnaires try their best and report those who post spoilers. Even though we can't get to them the second they get reported, our awesome mods are always at their best.

Shoutouts to /u/F_G_E_S , /u/FlyingGoatee and /u/Irf00 for doing excellent jobs behind the scenes. We will continue doing our best to be the best place to talk about Shingeki No Kyojin.

We are always open to hearing what you have to say so if you have any comments, feedbacks, or anything you want to see added in the subreddit, talk to us!

And now, as I close, I wanna share to everyone [this project](http://youtu.be/J8m-sH_x7KI) of mine that I just started on. It's still barely 1% done and this is just for you guys. :)

Anyways, that is all!

**4 MORE DAYS TIL THE NEXT EPISODE!!! A FEW MORE DAYS TIL THE NEXT CHAPTER!!!**

I can't wait! :D

I completely forgot that Ymir's name hadn't been mentioned in the anime yet, my apologies.

Hello all! I recently fell *totally* and *completely* in love with SnK, and I ended up reading the comics a few times. In the process, I came up with a few theories, ha ha. Since I've wasted so much time on them already, I figured I might as well share them. I apologize if other people came up with these theories already. In my defense, I couldn't find any similar theories after googling really quick.

But before I start talking about Reiner, Bertholdt, and Annie, I'd like to share [this pixiv user's observation](http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=36168936) that all the languages in this world is, in fact, [upside-down Japanese katakana](http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=manga_big&amp;illust_id=36168936&amp;page=20). The [comic covers all have those texts as well](http://shingeki-kyojin.com/archives/26439768.html) (thank you 2ch), and they say the following (my translation, will focus on readable English rather than accurate, direct translation - keep in mind that the Japanese language often leaves out subjects and has no forms for plurals, etc.):

&gt;Humanity's ideals are within these walls.

&gt;Let us build a world forever without war within these walls.

Some people on 2ch pointed out that this might be what the Wall religion teaches and therefore the information not necessarily accurate; however, many clues would make sense if this information is accurate. Therefore, I'm going to assume that these passages *are* accurate here. From these passages (and from my readings of the comics), I believe that there are three main groups of people/beings at play:

* Humanity inside the walls

* Humanity outside the walls

* Titans, who currently rule the world

What does all this have to do with Reiner, Bertholdt, and Annie? I believe that those three belong to the second group of people - the humanity that lives *outside the walls*.

Why?

Note how Bertholdt and Annie talks about the trainee soldiers. They view most of the trainees as those who only look out for their own safety and who has no interest in fighting the titans.

Bertholdt (Chapter 13):

&gt;You [Eren and Armin] are different from those other guys, aren't you? Those guys who don't know the terror of titans. The majority of them are here to protect their social reputation... They think that only cowards decide to become producers when they turn twelve... They decided to become soldiers by flowing with the public opinion that reversed after the fall of Wall Maria. But they don't intend to join the Scouting Legion. They aim for the Police Force. If not the Police Force, then they aim for the Stationary Troops, and eventually ask to be transferred to the Police Force...

Annie (Chapter 14):

&gt;ãªãããã®ä¸çã§ã¯å·¨äººã«å¯¾æããåãé«ããèã»ã©å·¨äººããé¢ãããããã©ããã¦ãããªè¶çªã«ãªãã¨æãï¼ãããäººã®æ¬è³ªã ããã§ã¯ï¼

&gt;For some reason, the more capable you are of fighting titans, the more you can get away from titans in this world. Why do you think things become such a farce like this? Isn't that because of human nature?

For some reason, they talk as if they're bitter that those soldiers don't seriously want to fight titans. This could be because they side with the titans and view humanity as pathetic beings, but this would not explain why Bertholdt did not object to Reiner agreeing with Eren's statement that Bertholdt and Reiner were mass murderers (Chapter 46). A better explanation would be that they viewed those inside the wall as privileged, lazy bums who abandoned the rest of humanity for their own benefit - this is assuming that the story told on the cover is correct, of course. This would nicely explain Reiner's possible motives for destroying the wall as well, and why he apparently changed his mind.

Perhaps the term 'warrior' was actually a term used by humanity outside the walls to describe *their* soldiers, who trained to actually *fight* the titans, in contrast to the soldiers *inside* the walls. Maybe that's what Annie meant when she said that she missed the opportunity to become a warrior. Maybe that's what Reiner and Bertholdt were training to become during that flashback, from [the clothing they were wearing](http://www.mangareader.net/shingeki-no-kyojin/40/44). If they were training to control their titan powers, they should turn into a titan to fight the Ymir-like titan. They did not. **This implies that they were humans at that point.**

Maybe this is what the kingdom wants to hide from the public - that they know there are more human beings outside the wall, and that they decided to abandon them completely.

How did the trio become titans? My guess is that the people within the trio's village were probably turned into titans, like the people from Connie's village. The trio somehow retain their intelligence, while their fellow villagers probably did not. Someone responsible for turning those people into titans - someone like the Ape Titan - probably promised the trio that he could turn the titans back to humans, if the trio would break down the Walls. This would explain what Ymir meant when she said that Bertholdt and Reiner would be able to go back home if they go to the Ape Titan.

This would also explain why Bertholdt and Annie claim that they are acting for their own safety first and foremost.

Annie (Chapter 21):

&gt;ç§ã¯ãã ãèªåãå©ããããã ããã

&gt;I just want to save myself.

&gt;You probably wouldn't understand how a weak little girl feels.

Bertholdt (Chapter 13):

&gt;åã«ã¯â¦èªåã®æå¿ããªããç¾¨ã¾ãããâ¦èªåã®å½ããå¤§äºãªãã®ããã£ã¦â¦

&gt;I... don't have my own will. I'm jealous that you have something more important than **your own life**...

If Annie, Bertholdt, and Reiner were working for the Ape Titan - or some mass organization of intelligent titans - then these lines make sense. Reiner was probably more motivated by revenge for abandoning humanity outside the walls. This might be why Reiner said he planned to destroy *this* humanity (ãã®äººé¡) instead of just humanity - because meant destroying the humanity *inside the walls*. This would nicely explain what Ymir meant when she said that Eren shouldn't aim to kill small fries like Bertholdt and Reiner in Chapter 46. This might also explain why Bertholdt said he thought it was ""unfortunate"" that Eren saw his own mother get eaten by titans.

But there might be more reasons for Bertholdt's comment. Remember that Reiner can't seem to read Ymir's language; remember that *someone* was recently living within Castle Utgard; that the Ape Titan asked Mike if the titan was speaking Mike's language. The Ape Titan apparently speaks a language that's not spoken within the walls, and was in the area around Castle Utgard; there were several goods (interestingly human-sized ones) with labels in Ymir's language in Castle Utgard. This leads me to think that the Ape Titan lived at Castle Utgard in human form.

I think that the Ape Titan and Ymir belong to the third group - the titans who rule the world. This would explain why Reiner agreed that Ymir would die if she went along with Reiner and Bertholdt, and why Reiner said he and Bertholdt could not guarantee her safety (if she sided with them, I presume) - because even if she sides with Reiner and Bertholdt, she is an escapee from the titan world. She says that, like Christa/Historia, she ""was hated just for being born."" The titans probably are interested in killing her, for whatever reason. This would explain why her reason for not being able to trust Reiner and Bertholdt was apparently because ""they don't trust her"" - because Ymir belongs to the group that probably took away Bertholdt and Reiner's home.

And there is something Ymir and the Ape Titan have in common - they have *elf ears*, as opposed to Reiner, Bertholdt, and Annie's titan forms, who have *human ears*. Who else has elf ears in his titan form?

Eren.

This, to me, implies that Eren descends from titans. Maybe Grisha or his ancestors, like Ymir, decided to get a new life as a human being within the walls. Maybe that's what's in the basement of Eren's home - goods, especially books, that his ancestors brought. Maybe this is why Grisha hid the basement - to hide their titan ancestry. Maybe Grisha truly did just give the shot for making Eren lose his memory, not for turning him into a giant. Maybe this is another reason why Reiner, Bertholdt, and Annie were so surprised when they saw Eren in his titan form - because he had elf ears. Maybe this is why Bertholdt thought that it was unfortunate Eren saw his own mother get eaten *at the time*, *before* he saw Eren in his titan form.

\*Pants\* Well, here's the theory I'm relatively more certain about.

Okay so this is just speculation right now, but I'm pretty convinced that the battle of humans vs the titans is a reference to the Olympians vs the Titans in [Titanomachy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanomachy), where the Titans would come and attack them in Mount Olympus.


[Eren represents Atlas](http://imgur.com/FZbmF3Z) during the last episode, a titan punished to hold up the sky for humanity, or in this case, Eren having no other choice but to lift and move a boulder to save humanity.

The three main titan, the armored titan, the colossal titan, and Eren represent the three
[Hekatonkheires](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hekatonkheires)

Briareus (ÎÏÎ¹Î¬ÏÎµÏÏ) the Vigorous - Vigor meaning Eren's iron will to still oppose the titans even when he is one.

Cottus (ÎÏÏÏÎ¿Ï) the Striker or the Furious - Armored titan

Gyes (ÎÏÎ·Ï) the Big-Limbed - Colossal titan


If you guys can find any errors, or more allusions i can fix this up, but this is looking pretty promising so far.

Full of SPOILER,probokator,24,5,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1er9b5/my_theory_full_of_spoiler/,"Okay, what do we know until now? There is no breach in the wall. That Titan who couldn't move is there, looks like Connie's mother and said, ""welcome back"" to him. There are alot of human which actually can turn into Titan (Eren, Annie, Bertholt, Ymir, and Reiner. So I'm guessing that all the Titans were actually a human morphed into titan. Some became titan while retain their intellligent and conciousness, like eren, annie, reiner, but much more just became a hollow monster. I theorize that in the past, human wages war against each other. Then they made somekind experiment and then able to make human turn into titan. Which obviously giving a lot of advantages in war. But something gone wrong. Something that made people into titan was spread uncontrolled, like an outbreak which like in resident evil when peoples becames zombie, but in this case people became titan. Not all titan retain conciousness. The majority lost it's mind and just act based on their instict which is to eliminate their human enemy (but because they lost their mind, they can't differ between enemies and allies). So basically they are only rampages on humankind which didn't turn into titan. The people who didn't infected by the outbreak defend themself by creating barrier. A wall. Made of people who willingly turn into titan, hardening their bodies and create a wall for the sake of the survive population. Now, that priest guy won't share the secret about the wall because of the greater cause. But what is the greater cause than to protect the humanity inside the wall? The only answer is other humanity in maybe another wall. We don't know that there are other people or not, other wall or not beside the wall we already see? Maybe Reiner, Bertholt, Annie was a soldier from other wall which is the enemy of the corrupt king and nobility which now rule the area in the wall we see. Maybe the king and their inner circle can turn into titan themself. So basically it is still war between two or more fronts of human. They using wild titan to decreased other front power then they will launch the last attack by elite soldiers who can turn to conscious titan. Eren maybe their leader, but somehow he lost his memory and with it his power. That wil explain why they kept trying to kidnap him and didn't just kill him. Hoping he will remember and gained the power he forget and attack the kingdom with them. Just a theory. Sorry for the shitty english.

1367896653.0,21,self.ShingekiNoKyojin,1du8xg,[Spoilers] The Colossal Titan and Armored Titan's role in the manga.,FlyingGoatee,24,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1du8xg/spoilers_the_colossal_titan_and_armored_titans/,"I recently caught up with the manga and one thing that really interested me is that the identities of the armored and colossal titans have already been revealed. More importantly, they're probably not super, crazy, evil people who pull the strings behind everything. It's just two young adults that Eren trained with. I'm thinking that they work under someone else. I just don't see two young adults as the face behind the curtains.

While the reveal was incredibly surprising, it was almost...underwhelming, though, not in a bad way. The colossal titan has always been the symbol for this series and with such a seemingly normal identity, I wonder if he will *remain* the mascot for AoT.

But what really sparked my doubts about the colossal titan remaining as THE titan was the introduction of the new intelligent deviant, the Orangatitan. Not only is he intelligent, but he's *really* clever. There was his ability to deduce what the 3D gear was and his dialogue. I'm specifically referring to the part where he says ""Oh...so you *can* speak..."".

I feel as though with the Colossal and Armored titans being revealed, the Orangatitan's introduction was a sign that he was going to take up the helm as the big bad titan.

Another interesting thing is that the Orangatitan didn't know that humans could talk. If there really was a human in its nape, they should know that. So there probably *isn't* a human controlling it. Which is curious because, so far, the only intelligent titans have been ones with humans inside them.

So what are your guys' thoughts on the Colossal, Armored, and Orangatitans?",Manga Spoilers,False,self,t5_2we2n,False,g,,True,t3_1du8xg,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1du8xg/spoilers_the_colossal_titan_and_armored_titans/,

I feel like everything is a confusing mess so I wrote this in another thread to try to make sense of it all in my mind. Looking for feedback and additions.

* Some humans can transform into titans at will. They also have more control over the form than normal titans, probably due to their intelligence. It has been heavily implied by the series that this ability was acquired by Eren because of an injection he received from his dad. A possible inference is that there is some sort of scientific process behind the transformations... possibly meaning that titans themselves were invented by humanity.

* Several groups living within the walls know (at least partially) the truth about titans. Some or all of the groups have the ability to transform into titans themselves. This contributes to the previous idea that the whole titan plague was caused by humanity. It certainly contradicts the narrative of titans randomly appearing and almost driving humans to extinction. Eren's dad either was a part of one of these groups or acquired this knowledge independently. His disappearance also seems deliberate, in light of the most recent manga chapter. It's possible that the highest government (the king) within the walls is also aware, as they've delegated certain wall related responsibilities to one of these groups. That means there's a compelling reason for keeping humanity alive that conflicts with the other goals.

* Several of those who can transform into titans belong to some kind of group that has the goal of knocking down all the walls and presumably destroying all of humanity. It has been implied that this goal is a means to a greater end. Those responsible are humans who have some sort of special knowledge that they believe makes their actions reasonable. Their desire to kidnap Eden could mean that (1) They need more people with the titan shaping ability and (2) They don't have the ability to bestow this ability, rather recruiting those who have it naturally.

* The timing of these wall destroying attacks must be significant, as there is no established reason why they could not have continued to destroy the walls in their form, instead choosing to revert to human form and undergo training as soldiers. Conventional military would not have been able to stop them, so it's possible that they were fearful of the religious group and the titans within the innermost wall.

* The latest ""breach"" was likely the transformation of normal humans inside the wall into titans by the Monkey Titan, who has his own motives and seems to lack the knowledge that the two soldiers who became the wall breaking Titans have. At least two vastly separate factions emerge here. Monkey Titan is obviously from outside the walls and has no knowledge of anything inside of them. Another factor pointing to the significance of this time is that the factions inside the walls with the knowledge of these titans appear to have existed since the walls were erected (and indeed appear to have been responsible for the walls themselves.)

My theory (I hope it's right) is that titans were some sort of scientific advancement by a group in a modern society for a higher goal. It's possible that every single thing that has happened so far has been roughly according to their plan. Based on what I've read, I think there are three seperate organized groups with control over Titan-transforming technology: the religious cult, the two wall breakers and the monkey titan.

* The religious group seems to want to reinforce the walls, indicating that they want to use their knowledge to protect humanity.

So since the conception of this subreddit, it has grown exponentially to the point that we really need a Subreddit Snoo that can define us.

==

**What is a Subreddit Snoo?**

- A subreddit snoo is basically the reddit alien customized to fit our subreddit.

The one we have right now is fine and all but we need something that has some traits of the reddit alien. (We will also retire the one we have right now and make him into a flair.)

==

If you're one of those talented people that follows the series and likes this subreddit, **here's what you do:**

- Draw your personal version on what you think the subreddit snoo should be.

- Make a full scaled one and a 135x135 one.

- Keep it SFW

- Send it to me as a PM here in Reddit. Make sure the title of the PM is ""Snoo Submission"" or something like it.

- **That's it!**

==

**Deadline:** Thursday, June 13, 2013 (1 week from now)

==

- The winner will be chosen by everyone here in the subreddit. A thread will be made once the voting begins.

*if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to post them down below.*


Also, shoutouts to the amazing new mods that has been implementing small changes around the subreddit!

Also, general discussion thread!",L3gionHD,28,8,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1eipmk/will_this_anime_become_one_of_the_big_three_also/,"A friend of mine seems convinced that it will. Naruto is coming to a close, and we've yet to see one really replace Bleach as of yet. The only one still going strong is One Piece, so there's pretty much two vacancies for a new anime to fill. The show (and manga) is so fantastic in every way. Easily one of my favourite anime of all time, and I'm only 6 episodes (45 chapters) in. The pacing is brilliant, plot twists, likeable characters, genuinely creepy villains, brilliant art style and voice acting aaaaaaaand.. Well, I could continue to gush, but you guys know all of this already. 

So what would the prerequisites be for it to become a ""big three"" anime? Well, it'd have to be a long show, and from what we've seen in the manga, I'd have to assume that it will be fairly long. There are copious amounts of unsolved mysteries at the moment. [What's in the basement? What are the Titan's motives? What's the plan of Bert and Reiner? What about that big hairy Titan? And that religion? And the royalty! And the Titans in the walls!? Seriously, so much to think about.](#spoiler) Seeing as there's so many plot twists and eventualities to think about, I'd say, and maybe I'm being optimistic here, but I think we're looking at a 200 episode anime at least. 

It has to sell well. And since the release of the anime, and particularly the recent cliffhanger in episode 5, it has done just that. Its sales are spectacular right now, and things appear to only be able to go up from here, which is a good sign. And seeing as how the quality of the manga hasn't dipped at all yet, I'd assume that the same would apply to the anime. The one thing I dread is filler. *Shudders*

Also, I'd just like to use this post to inform everyone that this anime is **the** anime to get your friends to watch. I have a group of 12 friends whom I hang out with regularly, and only 4 of those, including myself, watch anime. The others wouldn't be particularly interested in it. **However**, I strongly urged everyone in my group to watch it, and thus far 10 of them have. And guess what? All 10 of them started the first episode, and after watching it, were so drawn in that they watched the other 5 immediately after. They're all so amazed by it, and so am I, frankly. It's just so good. 

Ok, rant and gushing over. Let's use this thread to have a general discussion about the show, its direction, theories, and other Attack on Titan/Shingeki No Kyojin stuff.

I'm just so happy the series has been picked up by so many people and loved by a lot as well. Personally, this is definitely already a top 3 for me already in terms of the manga. Anime wise, it might be too early to rate it high yet. 

How about you?

I wanna thank /u/irf00 and /u/FlyingGoatee for helping me out with some remodeling that happened in the subreddit. It looks completely different now since we started.

I also want to thank everyone who moderates themselves when posting in threads. I know, it's very tempting to spoil some stuff when you're responding to a comment. I'm very happy that there's barely any instances that that has happened. 

Please keep it up, report or downvote all possible spoilers, and let's make this one of the best subreddits out there!

Anyways, now I wanna ask, what do you guys want to see in this subreddit? Do you have any recommendations/suggestions? What can we improve on? Please post anything at all in the comments.

That will be it for now. Episode 7 is just around the corner!

[Eren was the last person to see his dad](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/6241/shingeki-no-kyojin_v1_ch3_by_gantz-waitingroom/22), which implies that he did return after his trip. In [Chapter 10's flashback](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/6249/shingeki-no-kyojin_v3_ch10_by_gantz-waitingroom/35), Eren's dad took him to the forest to give the injection, after which Eren's dad disappeared. Given that Ymir referred to her time as a titan as a ""nightmare"", and that she doesnt remember who she ate (or remember much of it all) -- the ""memory"" loss of the injection refers to the memory loss that would accompany being a titan (before learning to control it). 

A side note to that, is that I think people lose memories only if they're not in control -- as Eren was during his first rampage and during the moments when he transformed to lift the rock. 

I think it's very unclear whether eating a number of people has to do with regaining humanity or not. 

2) I want to humor the time loop theory. Chapter 47 speaks of Eren ""possibly"" being the coordinate, and Christa being potentially useful in searching for the coordinate if Eren is not the coordinate.

The biggest reason I want to humor the time loop theory is that it explains the motivations of BRA very very clearly. They don't care about wiping out humanity, because they know that this future isn't going to be permanent (of course, there's still psychological impacts of mass murdering, which is seen). They break the walls down every five years, to give humanity time to adjust to try and sniff out the coordinate. They were ""wiping out humanity"" for the purposes of getting the coordinate out so they could use the time machine (or whatever) with the ""coordinate"" to try and create a future that's different from how the government/cult is using (which is likely trying to extent the stay in the walls as long as possible), versus trying to create a better future where humanity take more risks. I feel like this would symbolically fit very well with the series. 

The wall cult being part of it would make Christa also important as Chapter 47 would state.

I think this also makes Eren and the cult leader much more interesting -- ""residual"" emotions from previous time loops are affecting them, especially Eren, which is why he and the pastor are the most emotionally crazy individuals in the series.

First off, I would like to again welcome the new members of the subreddit. More than 300 people joined in during this weekend and after episode 5, I don't blame them. ""WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK"" was probably the most popular expression after seeing it.

As you're reading this, I'm pretty sure you already noticed the new layout design of the subreddit compared to this weekend. There were many comments and request to change up the look of things because it was a complete ""abomination"". So here it is. A lighter, more easy to the eyes style of subreddit. 

No, I didn't make the CSS from scratch. All credit goes to /r/boxed for that. The guy running the subreddit was kind enough to share to the public the CSS codes for it. I still have things to fix here (like the user bar. lol. it's just there, floating.)

Anyways, let's go through the changes one by one.

=

Added: Header made by /u/FlyingGoatee

Added: Title logo edited out by me. :3

~~Added: Header made by /u/Irf00~~

~~Added: plain background with logo. thoughts?~~

~~**Header**~~ removed by request

~~This was the header that I used before the last one. It's just a simple screen grab from the anime intro with some filter added in. It is more simple and easy to the eye than the other one and it kinda works well with the overall theme of the subreddit.~~

=

**Chibi Titan**

All credit goes to /u/Irf00 for helping me find it and fixing it up. I don't believe it's an original work by his but I only plan on using it temporarily as I will be hosting a **drawing contest** very soon to see if any one of you has actual talents to draw a reddit alien fit for us. 

=

**Updated Flairs**

I added changes to some of the flairs available. Before, we only had the B&amp;W versions of the army divisions emblems. Now that the anime is out, I am finally able to add the colored ones shown in an episode.

As for the emblems of the three walls (Maria, Rose, Sina), I kept the ones in the manga in place. The reason being is that the ones that are shown in the anime all seem too similar to each other and would be impossible to tell each one apart in such small dimensions.

Some people did request if it's possible to make the flairs smaller. I did try and see if it would work but unfortunately, it doesn't. So in turn, what I did is just place the emblem at the left side of your name of each posts. Now, I believe the flairs look better aligned with everything else even if it's still the same size.

=

**Updated Sidebar**

Along with the new theme is a new sidebar. Highlight one of the options and more options will be revealed like the newest episodes or chapters, where to watch the series, where to buy the novels, etc.

The sidebar also shows the **New Spoiler system**. It's a little bit more neat looking and easy to use but don't worry, the old style still works.

=

**Rules**

So now that the subreddit is much bigger than it was 3 nights ago, we need to add new rules to keep this subreddit as clean and safe for everyone to visit. (Spoiler-wise)

*Rule #1* **Do Not Post Spoilers in the Title!**

e.g. 

-
Bad - ""OMG I'm so mad that Voldermort killed Optimus Prime! Anyone else?""

Good - ""HarrFormers Episode 99 Discussion""

-

Bad - ""[Spoiler] So after Goku finally learned to fly the Wing Gundam, how did Kamina....?""

Good - ""[Spoler] Question about the ending of chapter 22. Sort of confused.""

-

*Rule #2* Please moderate yourself and your comments

Unfortunately, this is one of those series where you really cannot be spoiled on what is going to happen in the next episode or the next chapter to fully appreciate the series.

If you are reading the manga, please try your best to contain yourself and know if you're about to post something that may not seem like a spoiler but it actually is. 

Some spoilers that pains me to see [Saying Ymir's name, powers, hinting on who is bad and who is not, etc.](#spoiler ""Heavy Manga"").

Episode 7 SPOILERS!,Zidjianisabeast,22,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1eo1wu/greek_symbolism_in_attack_on_titan_episode_7/,"Hey, everyone I just recently got exposed to Attack on Titan and love the show. So I wanted to share my thoughts on one of the scene from Episode 7. Before that however just a couple names and some background into greek mythology to make sense of the story.

Hades-Greek god of the Underworld, tricks Persephone into staying in the underworld.

Zeus-King of the Greek God, makes Hades share Persephone.

Demeter-Greek Goddess of the Harvest

Persephone-Daughter of Demeter, she was tricked into having to stay in the underworld.

Does anyone else think that the pomegranate scene is a symbolic throwback to greek mythology? Since in greek mythology Persephone or Demeter's daughter was tricked by Hades into staying since she ate of the Pomegranate. It was a rule that anyone that ate food or drink in hades realm had to stay there which is why she has to go back down according to myth.

However since Zeus couldn't let her stay in the Underworld permanently because Demeter was so distraught that no crops would grow he made Hades share her. Which is why for some months out of the years the crops don't grow. In some versions it explains the number of months by the number of seeds that she eats so anywhere from 3-7 seeds.

This is why the ancient greeks thought the seasons to be the way they are because Demeter became depressed while Persephone was gone to Hades and nothing grew.

In relation to attack on Titan. We see her questioning why she goes on.

Then the Pomegranate shines in the light and the other Titan shows up. She remembers Eren's words and fights resolving to never give up again no matter what.

If the idea that the titans are biological creations of science holds true, what if the very first tests were done on plants: Specifically trees. This would explain for why the forest of giant trees seems so  ""out of place,"" as well as the fact that this forest was previously a tourist attraction. Of course, large trees are tourist attractions in the real world, for example the Redwood National Park in California, but the fact that humanity does not have a definitive time period for when titans emerged shows how the trees could eventually become a tourist attraction. Another interesting idea is how titans are so similar to plants (light for energy = photosynthesis, could eating humans be their way of acquiring H2O?). Also, I think it would be an amazing philosophical message how if the beginnings of the titans lie in these giant trees, and that these forests, the  ""perfect environment "" for 3D maneuver gear thus being the perfect area for killing titans, will lead to the their downfall.

1376183489.0,17,self.ShingekiNoKyojin,1k4bwm,[Manga Spoilers] Thoughts about the injection Eren's father gave Eren,Slender_Mann,21,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1k4bwm/manga_spoilers_thoughts_about_the_injection_erens/,"I'm pretty sure this actually ISN'T manga spoilers, but I don't even know anymore so I'm going to mark it unless I'm 100% sure.

So basically, when Eren's being questioned after turning into his titan for the first time, Eren remembers when his father gave him the key to the basement.

[#1](http://z.mhcdn.net/store/manga/8886/010.0/compressed/kimg_059.jpg) ""When I get back...There's that room in the basement, which I've always kept secret... Well, I'll show it to you.""

[#2](http://z.mhcdn.net/store/manga/8886/010.0/compressed/kimg_060.jpg?) ""Eren... See this key..? Be sure to keep it on your person at all times... And whenever you see it...Remember...""

[#3](http://z.mhcdn.net/store/manga/8886/010.0/compressed/kimg_061.jpg) ""It is indispensable that you go to that basement... **With this injection, you will experience losses of membery. That's why I cannot explain anything right now... But somebody, when you go to the basement, you'll find out the truth. The journey will be a bitter and harsh one...**

[#4](http://z.mhcdn.net/store/manga/8886/010.0/compressed/kimg_062.jpg) ""But you must reconquer Wall Maria and reach that basement... The ""power"" ought to prove useful then. As for the way to use it, their memories should teach you what you need to know...""


The first page isn't that important, I just included it so everyone knows where I'm starting. However, take a look at the background of the second panel. When I read this, I actually thought they were IN the basement, I had no idea they were in the forest somewhere. I have no idea where this is, but I'm assuming it's in some forest within the wall near their village but a distance away.

In the third panel, his father says to Eren, ""With this injection, you will experience losses of memory."" Go back a few pages to the part where he's being initially questioned about whether he's a human or titan.

Eren says, ""Damn it... **I don't have the faintest memory of how I ended up here... I feel so numb I can't even stand...** And if they didn't like what I have to say, I'm a dead man.. Me? Dying by human hands? That's ridiculous...""



**I think I hit an image limit, here's a direct link:** z.mhcdn.net/store/manga/8886/010.0/compressed/kimg_055.jpg



What I actually want to address with all of this is what exactly that injection did. MOST people agree that the injection gave Eren his titan powers. I think there's two possibilities here: 

1. The injection gave Eren titan powers
2. The injection ""unlocked"" and already inherent property of humans which allowed use of the titan powers (Basically, everyone has the potential to be a titan, but it needs to be ""activated"" so to speak)

I don't think we have the resources to know this yet and I'm not sure of the answer myself (Although I'm leaning towards #2 since Monkey Trouble turned that one village into titans supposedly in the breach arc recently)

However, what I am confident in saying is that the injection made Eren transform on the spot and I also want to propose an already-mentioned theory about Eren's father.

First, here's some things to note about why I think Eren transformed on the spot:

1. He was taken to the woods to get the injection. Why would he need to leave the village entirely to give an injection that enables titan powers? How about if it would turn him into a titan initially on the spot (or at least has the chance)?

2. Memory loss. In the scan where he's being questioned, he says he doesn't remember anything. Eren's father also tells him he'll experience memory loss with the injection. Basically, he's going to suffer the side-effects of being a titan from the injection, hence why I think he DID turn into a titan at the spot.

There's also something else I want to address that I just thought of: The basement. No one really knows what's in the basement right now, but while most think it's some secret about the titans, it might not be as important as everyone thinks. I do think it has valuable information, but I don't think it's anything that's going to save humanity on its own. What does Eren's father accomplish by telling Eren that no matter what, he has to get to the basement by taking back Wall Maria? It gives him a goal and purpose. Since he's the one injection Eren with something that will allow titan powers, surely he knows enough about how shifters work and that he needs a purpose to ""activate"" the powers. The basement might not have something as important as we've been led to believe, but just think about what he has to do to complete the ""purpose"" he was given. He has to get rid of all the titans within Wall Maria and seal it off, essentially restoring the civilization to where it started, resetting the board to where things were before the attack. He's basically getting Eren's foot in the door mentally and preparing him for what he needs to do.

Next up, Eren's father. We haven't seen him since this scene from what I recall. There's a lot of speculation about where he is. Some say he is Monkey Trouble, some say he's left the civilization altogether and traveled to another human civilization, some say he's in BRA's village, some say he's dead.

I'm not positive on my position, but I think the two likely cases are:

1. He's in BRA's village.

2. He's dead.

As for why he'd be in BRA's village: If he has an injection to make people shifters, I'm going to say it's safe to assume he has/had contact with other shifters. Where is the best place to look for shifters as far as we know so far? BRA's village, wherever that is. If there's someplace Eren's father can go where nobody will find him, it's going to be outside the wall.

As for why he could be dead: In this case, I picture Eren as Goku and Eren's father as Grandpa Gohan. Eren transforms and Eren's father is an unintended (or perhaps intended on his father's part?) casualty.

However the 3rd track,  Moshi Kono Kabe no Naka ga Ikken no Ie Dato Shitara is the one that threw me off the most. It's initially thought to be the ""odd one"" that doesn't fit into the whole OST, but at the very end, it plays the ominous tune that plays at the very beginning of Guren no Yumiya so either the whole Single was meant to be played in a loop or track 3 was meant to be played first chronologically as a prequel.",,False,self,t5_2we2n,False,,,True,t3_1hwqet,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1hwqet/something_interesting_that_should_be_noted_about/,

I think I figured, what [this](http://imgur.com/DgpaTJA) picture means.

First of all we see a war between humans on the picture, so this probably happened a long time ago. But who is fighting who? My theory is that one side shows humans, who later (after the attack of the titans 100 years ago) escaped behind the Walls and the other side are humans outside the Walls we haven't seen yet. The faction outside the Walls is still trying to destroy the other inside the Walls with using Titans as weapons. They use Shifters to infiltrate (Annie) or/and destroy (R&amp;B) the Walls to let in other Titans (notice that they aren't immune to the normal or abnormal Titans). Shifters don't even need to kill people and just let other titans do the dirty work.

Secondly, they aren't all Shifters and they threaten those who are with unknown reasons. They did so with Annie, Reiner, Berthold AND the friend that Ymir ate, since they were the only Shifters known at that time. But somehow they need more of them to be stronger, so they searched for Ymir inside the Walls 5 years ago (Shiaganshina incident) to have someone eat her to get another obedient Shifter (Ymir probably won't help them willingly). So they used Shifters for the first time. And after A&amp;R&amp;B found Eren, they abandoned the plan for Ymir, since Eren would have been enough. But they still found her and took her with them. Ymir realized the defeat of the Walls and decided to let Historia live with the other faction. 

Now I think that the quote from Ymir ""There is no future inside the Walls"" doesn't mean the extinction of the human race but rather the presumed victory for the people outside the Walls, who aren't allies with Titans but only use them as weapons. Titans aren't the real threat but the other faction of humans.",Manga Spoilers,True,nsfw,t5_2we2n,False,g,crow26,True,t3_1k67jm,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1k67jm/manga_spoilers_ch48_a_theory_on_the_2nd_ending1st/,

If you don't want to click I'll quote the important part (and I don't know about you but these don't sound boring to me at all, I dunno what this guy is thinking): 


&gt;There are plot blurbs available on Amazon.co.jp, but frankly they sound kind of boring. 

&gt;The first novel is about a Scouting Legion member named Angel (SUBTLE!!!!!!!) who is determined to find the titansâ weakness and develop ârevolutionary anti-Titan weaponry.â  The manga DID mention that it took a damn long time for humanity to figure out that slicing the back of the neck is the only way to destroy a titan, so maybe Angel is the guy we can credit with that discovery? 

&gt;Okay, so the second and third novels take place fifteen years later and follow the adventures of Kyukuro, a boy who somehow - stay with me here, Iâm totally fucking serious, this is what the plot descriptions on shingeki.net and amazon.co.jp actually say - is discovered as a newly-born infant inside a pile of titan excrement after his pregnant mother is swallowed and shat out by a titan.  And of course he ends up joining the Scouting Legion because why not.


Haven't we read in the manga (I did say manga spoilers, right? Don't read ahead if you haven't read the manga!) that the titans don't actually digest the people they eat and throw them up later? However I can't remember exactly what issue that happened in and the novel did first come out in 2011 so it's possible that wasn't revealed at that point or something like that.

/edit: just read a bit more and it looks like the kid was found inside the remains of a titan, not inside its crap. That makes more sense now



Anyways, I would love to find a way to read these. I've seen the Japanese ones up on ebay and amazon and stuff but unfortunately I don't know Japanese or else I'd just buy them myself. If anyone here does and wants to buy them and translate them somehow (that would probably be a lot of work, but hey it's worth asking) I'd be happy to pay money (or reddit gold or whatever you want) for the translations and I'm sure other people would as well. Or there is probably some sort of copyright infringement that we'd be doing or something like that so maybe just release them free and get some real life karma. Whatever works, as long as me and my fellow english speakers can read them somehow.


Anyways, if anyone knows anything about these books I'd really appreciate any info to help feed this hunger I have for more SnK.

So I've been reading through the past chapters, hoping to pick up on some clues, since the manga does have a lot of foreshadowing. Right now, most of what I've collected is quite scattered, but I at least managed to put together some sort of theory centralized around Ymir. I mostly want to share it to see if people can help me fill in the gaps that's present in this theory that I haven't been quite been able to piece together. 

Alright, so let's start. I'll start by putting together the background information, and then lead to Ymir's origins. This post will include spoilers up to the latest chapters. 

**1) Some notes on ""Titan tranformation technology""**

I think we can largely divide them into two types -- ones that are operational at night, and ones that are immobile at night. The ones that are immobile at night [are connected with Ymir](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/175711/shingeki-no-kyojin_v11_ch46_by_no-group/14). The titans linked to Ymir are ones that need sunlight to operate. The ones that don't need sunlight are likely linked to the hairy titan (from what we know so far, since he's the one who turned the village into Titans of this type).

It's also fairly clear at this point, I think, that it is humans that turn into Titans. Ymir and Reiner both know this and that is the reason why they both go out of the way to shut Connie down (Reiner going as far to go with him to his village because he realizes what's going on) when he suggests that. They are keeping all of that a secret for now, for whatever reason.

Side Note: I think this is why Eren's kind of a key figure -- his Titan transformation tech is likely different from the others, although we're not quite sure in what way yet. This is something that'll only get revealed later.

**2) The wall existed before the humanity needed to flee to them.**

First, [there's some ""evidence""](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=395667&amp;currentpage=13#255) I've seen that I'm not too sure if it's true or not. But even disregarding this, there's some reasons why this may be the case -- the first and foremost being that a) The innermost wall is built with Colossal Titans, b) there's no way for fleeing humans to be able to construct such a wall -- after all, they were fleeing from Titans.

I do recognize that there is a possibility that the fleeing humans could have had titan tranformation technology and put together a wall the very last minute. But I do think it's more likely that...

**3) The wall was constructed by Ymir's people**

There are castles within the walls, and one of the castles that had their names revealed has a very interesting name -- [Utgard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Atgar%C3%B0ar), translated to ""Land of the giants"". I'm sure everyone knows the significance behind Ymir's name so I won't bother explaining the connection, but what confirms this connection between the castle and Ymir is that she is able to [read the can](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/135631/shingeki-no-kyojin_v9_ch38_by_tdx/31) that was written in a language that Reiner wasn't able to understand. Furthermore, the castles existed before the walls -- after all, the humanity that moved into the walls had no reasons to construct castles (especially within Wall Rose out of all places).

But the evidence I'm most intrigued by, is the fact that the Titans who are making up the wall are powered by sunlight. The religion group also knows about this, and covers it up. If Ymir is indeed connected to the type of Titans that require sunlight -- then we can make this connection. So far, we do know Ymir is at least connected with a group of Titans, as evidenced by the [side chapter](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/89453/shingeki-no-kyojin_v5_ch18.5_by_gantz-waitingroom).

Christa/Historia is also a big important piece -- after all, both Reiner and Ymir are after her and protecting her for whatever reason. 

Finally, another ""weak"" piece of evidence is that Ymir's people lived in the walls (one was in the scouting legion!). However, they had no idea who Ymir is, implying I think that Ymir is much older than she is....

Side note: The manga also points out that [someone was using the castle before the scouting legion arrives there](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/135631/shingeki-no-kyojin_v9_ch38_by_tdx/22). That is worth noting, but there's still too many possibilities on what it could be. My bet is on Eren's dad, but possibly also various people connection to the religion.

**4) Ymir's origin**

Chapter 40 is one of the most informative chapters in the manga with regards to this. The first most important part is [Ymir and Christa's conversation.](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/145464/shingeki-no-kyojin_v10_ch40_by_tdx/25). The important bit is that Ymir tells Christa that they are alike, and when asked ""You experienced something similar in your life...?"" and she answers ""Well... Kind of..."". 

This is culminated with [her monologue](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/145464/shingeki-no-kyojin_v10_ch40_by_tdx/38). The most important lines being: ""[I was hated for the simple fact of my existence in this world... and I... Died... ...For the happiness of a great many people.](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/145464/shingeki-no-kyojin_v10_ch40_by_tdx/39)""

Ymir ""died"". Her existence likely refers to her Titan form -- which would mean that her titan form was used for something -- a guess of mine would be crystalization, and she awoke with her ""second chance at life"". So for whatever reason, 1) She was hated for being a Titan, 2) But Titans (or people who got turned into Titans) worshipped specifically Ymir. Perhaps this is in reference to ""her death"" that led to ""happiness of a great many people"", and the people who turned into Titans after recognize this. 

The reason why I speculate crystalization is that someone on her race not recognizing who Ymir was (if she made such a big impact, I'm sure her kind people have remembered better). My guess is that she was the first experimental subject (would explain her name, and the fact that she doesn't know too much about her Titan powers, and why she was feared and hated by her people). The question would be, ""why was she crystalized""?


Another thing here is to think about when and where Reiner and Berthold being attacked by Ymir would take place, whether it is before or after. My guess is that it would be outside Wall Maria (because this would have had to take place *before* Wall Maria was attacked, and if it was inside Wall Maria, it would have been a bigger deal and it's more likely Berthold/Reiner are from the outside), meaning Berthold and Reiner are from outside of the wall (and by that logic, also Annie).

Another thing to note is that [the church only appeared five years ago](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/89454/shingeki-no-kyojin_v5_ch19_by_gantz-waitingroom/19). They existed beforehand, but the question is whether or not Ymir knew about it, because she was listening to them. It almost seems like she did do it purposely, but that would also help us place Ymir's ""second chance at life"" somewhere in the timeline, because it's likely she was looking for information, not ""money"".

**5) Wild Guesses**

People have been speculating that there's some war between Titans that are going on. I think this is becoming more and more evident, especially given the difference in Titan transformation types. The latest chapter, also, confirms that there are at least 3 factions -- the beast titan, reiner/berthold/annie, and ymir. Christa and Eren are both very important chess pieces. 

**Final Notes**

Please note that these are just deductions (some wilder than others) and I've connected a lot of dots. As with any connect the dots go -- there's a very good chance I may have connected the dots in a weird way. This is one of the reasons I've written this post, because I want to make the most out the foreshadowing and subtle hints dropped by the author. But at least the little information drops, I hope, will be useful in having fun with future chapters. 

Another note is that I'm fairly convinced that the series is very metaphorical, so symbolism, I think, could be a very useful tool in putting more pieces together. Of course we would have to deduce some parts about what the author is trying to say (he's said quite a bit though already!), but that's another angle that I haven't really looked at yet.

Finally, I think all I've done is get at some background, but we don't quite have motives yet, but those can be anything since we only have so much. But I hope the background information helps others come up with more interesting theories!

If you listen to the songs, you notice they're almost written *for* the show, as opposed to being just another random pop hit slotted in for an opening. They really hit home for me with the series in ways you don't consciously grasp, which really made me appreciate how well they set the show's tone before the show starts (as OPs after all). I think the way I would describe their tone after listening to them would be:

OP 1: Desperate Morale before The Last Stand

OP 2: Hope Against All Odds

With the distinction between the 2 being that in the first there is no hope, only a desperate primal call for motivation before certain death; while in the second, a small glimmer of hope is present, and is wrung dry for what it's worth despite being for a yet invisible end, because it's all we have left.

So season 1 already reached the halfway point and I was wondering what you guys think will be the season finale?

The most likely scenario would be when they captured the female Titan. That would be a good way to end the season right before they attempt to see who's inside.

The fact that Mikasa's mother was pure ""Oriental"" leads to my theory that, the three walls are set in Northern Europe, close to Denmark where the African population is demographically low (as in &gt;=1). The last names of many of the characters I THINK all are VERY European as well, with no Spainish (Western European) or Russian (Far Eastern) names (AS FAR AS I KNOW), being mentioned either . 

BUT,
Europe now is starting to really become a melting pot of race/ethnicity. This questions my theory as their in now a SIGNIFICANT black population in the U.K., Italy, and France, ranging from 5% to 10% of the total population.

Germany only has a African-German population at around 1% as of late.


Then again...I'm only watching the show, and not reading the manga.

In this little post I just wanted to ask people what their arc rankings are. Now in the manga there has been three completed major arcs: the Trost Arc, the Female Titan Arc, and the Breach Arc.

Trost Arc - To make things simple we'll say this started on episode one and ended with Eren closing the gate of Trost in his titan form.

Female Titan Arc - This arc started off with Eren detained and about to go to court. It ended with the climactic battle between eren and the female titan along with the revelation that Wall Rose has been breached.

Breach Arc - This began with the 104 trainees squad and some scouting legion members making quick decisions to deal with the 'breach' of wall rose. It ended with the grand battle between Eren and the armored titan along with the capture of Eren and Ymir. (The next arc after this is the Pursuers Arc and is not completed yet thus wont be part of this discussion).

1. Breach Arc

2. Female Titan Arc

3. Trost Arc

This is an idea I've just had - what if Sasha's insatiable hunger is going to provide a pivotal role in the plot at some point?

When Eren was injected with the serum by his father, his father said that ""their memories"" would explain to him how to use his power.  This implies to me that the serum was effectively a mixture of Titan-extract, more or less.  And this makes me think that Titan-powers are gained via the physical flesh or matter of a Titan.

Further evidence that Titan-powers are gained via eating is that Ymir only ever regained her human form after eating Bert and Reiner's friend.  If his Titan powers included transforming, then she gained that power when she ate him.

So Sasha provides an easy method to introduce the concept that becoming a Titan requires eating Titan flesh.  At some point she will become so hungry, that she'll eat Titan flesh, and boom! She's a Titan.

But then, how does the Ape Titan transform an entire village into Titans?  Ingestion of Titan-matter is necessary, and he doesn't appear to be carrying any sort of tools.  Several methods are possible, but they all seem absurd - he pissed on the villagers, he spits on the villagers, he sheds his hair and people inhale it.",Manga Spoilers,True,nsfw,t5_2we2n,1373243417.0,g,,True,t3_1htwrp,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1htwrp/plot_relevance_of_sasha/,

(Warning: This article contains heavy SPOILERS, especially for viewers of the Anime. If you still wish to read about the âAttack on Titanâ series, and you do care about spoilers, feel free to check out our upcoming general series review.)


As with most shonen action series (especially very good ones), itâs very possible to forget our responsibility as fans to question the purpose, or raison dâetre behind the protagonistsâ choices, largely due to the enthralling action scenes that tend to distract us so well.


âAttack on Titanâ (Shingeki no Kyojin) embodies this phenomenon, as all questions about the origin of the Titans are quickly thrown aside thanks to the ever-evolving problems that arise from the Titansâ extreme violence, and the inabilities of the human race in combating said violence. Indeed, a few google searches reveal that the growing fan base has had little to no discussion regarding the Titansâ origins: something this article hopes to remedy.


In order to begin our analysis, we should lay out an important but glaring rule:


The world of âAttack on Titanâ seems to operate within the realm of reality (albeit, an alternate reality). In order to combat the Titans, the human race, and all three of its military divisions, rely solely on science. Aside from the mystery that surrounds the Titans themselves, every other aspect of the world has some sort of believable or scientific background that can be explained. Regardless as to whether or not the 3DM gear the Legion uses to combat the titans, or the walls surrounding mankind can actually exist, we, as readers and viewers, are forced to assume that these creations are not the result of say, a wizard or a higher power. In fact, the only role religion plays in the series is a cult that worships the actually walls, and is treated by the author as a hindrance to political decisions (as seen in Erenâs trial after his Titan transformation). Even Erenâs incredible ability to transform into a Titan is given to him by the power of science (through Dr. Jaegerâs chemical injection).


Therefore, assuming that the above is true, and that the author is operating in the realm of an alternate reality (and not fantasy), the characteristics of the Titan that we do know about may spell out some jarring conclusions. For the sake of discussion, Iâm going to lay out one of these theories, and my reasons afterwards:


The Titans are a human creation used to unify the human race in order to prevent its self-induced extinction. 


Now thereâs a lot of possible evidence, so Iâm going to quickly go line-by-line. Please excuse the quickness!


1st: The Titans came into existence 100 years ago. Assuming a âgodâ or magical power didnât create the Titans, evolution is not a possible option, and an artificial creation is the only possible answer.


2nd: The anatomy of the Titans doesnât follow the organic rules of nature. Titans can regenerate their limbs and have no reproductive organs. Perhaps this could be used as evidence against the theory Iâm laying out, but it would seem jarring to the story if the author suddenly revealed that he allowed supernatural powers to exist in his so-far scientific oriented world. 


3rd: The Titans have a singular purpose. They seem to only exist in order to kill humans through ingesting them. However, after eating them, they vomit them back up, implying that their desire to hunt isnât for mere survival purposes. This is further evidenced by the fact that they donât need food to survive, and donât choose to attack any other living creatures. 


4th: Before the beginning of the story, humanity was doing extremely well. Indeed, in the time leading up to the attack on Wall Maria by the Colossal and Armored Titans, humanity was in a time of peace and order, largely due to the protective measures taken to fight the Titans, and the Titansâ role as a unifying enemy that lead to universal trust in the government. Indeed, when Erenâs transformative powers are revealed in non-government newspapers in later chapters, citizens are heard saying claiming the story to be false, largely to the lack of government endorsement. Furthermore, before the Wall of Maria, the people of inner walls seem to have never been exposed to hardship, as they react to the inflow of refugees with extreme distaste and surprise.


5th: The author characterizes governments as immoral and even genocidal. The campaign to recapture the Wall Maria left hundreds of thousands dead, and was seen as a thinly veiled way to thin the herds of the human population and halt the food crisis. Assuming a government is willing to send all of these people to a hopeless death, why canât we assume that a previous human government or organization engineered the Titans to also fulfill the desire for a âgreater goodâ?


6th: In the most recent chapters of the manga, we learn that the Titans found in the inner areas seemed to have spawned from human villages, and that there were no breaches in Wall Rose. Indeed, Connie even claims that the fetal-like Titan laying on his house seems to resemble his mother in appearanceâan eerily foreboding statement given that his entire village seems to have disappeared. This whole development implies that the Titans may be capable of forming through the mass death of human individualism. Though the ways in which this happen are impossible to speculate at this point, it is indeed possible that we can assume there is a scientific reason for this phenomenon.


Before ending this piece, I find it important to remind our readers that this article doesnât mean to make any definitive claims; rather, I hope it serves to stimulate a thought-provoking discussion.

The technology in the Shingeki No Kyojin world seems very ahead of it's time. The 3d maneuver gear especially. We could always just say ""oh well for plot purposes they have this advanced gear."" I honestly don't buy that answer. But I'm going to come back to this.

Now lets talk about someone I'll call monkey titan, or MT for short. I don't believe MT is a ""true"" titan as some would like to suggest. I think it is possible that he might have been the first titan, or perhaps the one who started turning humans into titans (under the assumption of course that that is how the titans started appearing). Or maybe he could be the best titan, i.e the best form any titan could hope to achieve.[This](http://www.mangapanda.com/shingeki-no-kyojin/35/38) is why I think he is not a ""true"" titan. He says in the nape of **our** necks. As in, he is identifying himself with the other titans. 

Another note on him identifying with the language. I don't think it's because he is a different species or he is an alien or anything. I think it's because when he was human, he was from a different land. One of the indicators of this are his human like actions (like the way he moves about and motions with his hands) and another is when he mentions swords in that same page i linked earlier. It's kind of like if I go to europe and Identify their ""football"" as ""soccer."" I'm identifying it with something that is exactly the same but with the name I'm accustomed to calling it.

Some may say ""well what about [this panel](http://www.mangapanda.com/shingeki-no-kyojin/35/43) when he calls the humans 'they'"" I don't think he is referring to ""them"" as  humans, but more as ""the people in the walls."" Now, I want to jump to [this panel](http://www.mangapanda.com/shingeki-no-kyojin/42/15) when Ryner refers to the place they want to go back to as their ""home."" And how they don't have to massacre the humans anymore because of eren. 

My prediction regarding eren and the massacring of the humans is that there is something about the humans inside the wall that makes *them* the bad guys. I believe this ties in with the ""disease"" that eren's dad saved everybody from. Perhaps the 3 walls were built not to save humans from the titans, but to save the rest of the world from the remaining regular humans. [This panel](http://www.mangapanda.com/shingeki-no-kyojin/42/25) kind of hints at that idea. That Ryner and bert saw people in his village get eaten by titans, then he was approached by the group outside the walls, and they basically told him the theory I have above. That he had to do it for some greater good. 

What I can't figure out is why there are some titans who are stupid, some who are abberants, some who are like the Teen Titans, and some like Berterolt and the wall titans. 

Hope you guys enjoyed this. Every time I a new episode comes out I get more ideas like these because it is clearer than the manga. If people like this I'll try to make it a regular thing :)

**TL;DR** Titans could be good guys humans inside the walls bad guys.

**edit**: [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1f2jxr/never_forget/ca6l7gq) gave me an idea. I think that would make sense. But it isn't just anybody who died, it would be people who died and then something was done to them. That's why some titans are sentient but most aren't (perhaps). In order to be sentient you have to be alive when you are made into a titan. Maybe, I dunno.

**edit2**: I never came back to the technology. I honestly have no idea how to explain this. The year is only 850 A.D, so like Dark Ages in Europe/Rise of Islam in the Middle East and North Africa. Neither of which areas were technologically advanced enough to have anything even NEAR what AoT has. Now I know what you're thinking ""Birdslapper it's an anime man come on!"" Yeah yeah I know but it's bugging me I can't let it slide. Honestly though I can't think of anything for the advanced technology. Aliens? Time Travel? Who knows?

**edit3**: I'm not trying to say that these are the *exact* reasons for unexplained things or that these things *will* happen, rather that these are possibilities.

So, based on information at a given:

They give off heavy vapors that are hot at some points

Disintegrate quickly

Regenerate quickly

The fact they are called Titans

They consume humans to kill them rather than just smacking them around (but it seems that some of them do kill them that way. The main way they do it is consumption though)

They biologically do not need to consume humans

They ignore animals (unless animals are helping humans escape them)

They can talk, but they usually don't. Most of the time you just hear ""aaaaaargh"" or something like that. There was a point where some titan did manage to talk, but all he said was something about ""Ymir's People"". Another Titan, which aren't like the others, the Ape Titan was rather intelligent and interested in the 3D Maneuver gear. He also could talk.

Some humans can create a titan body at will. Notice how its not ""transforming"". They do not transform, as their original body stays in tact (or rather, gets regenerated and gets stuck to a titan body that is created from them).

Not all humans can become titans. This is a big guess because when titan shifters are hurt, they can regenerate and form a titan body while others could not.


Greek Mythology Time!
The Titan Cronos would consume his newborn children due to a prophecy proclaiming that one of them would overthrow him. One did manage to escape his wrath, in the end, his child Zeus did fulfill the prophecy and casted Cronos to the abyss known as Tartarus. (Probably not accurate, but close).

Why do Titans eat people?
They obviously do not need to eat people. Its most likely that they are being forced to kill people this way, because if you consume them, they aren't escaping anywhere.

Reiner and Bertholdt said their goal was the destroy mankind, but was no longer needed. I think that's bullcrap. They didn't participate in the actual wiping out of mankind and instead let the other titans do it. They merely made it possible by destroying the walls. So, they had a reason to break down the walls and it was most likely not to destroy mankind. They would have just broke down all the walls then and there. When Eren became a Titan, a lot of the titans started aiming for him, which is a bit suspicious. Why all of a sudden aim for him? Also, Reiner and Bertholdt asked Eren to come with them after revealing their secret, and if he did come with them, they wouldn't have to destroy the walls. So, this means that they really are targeting him specifically, but for what reason, I don't know. There must be some other enemy outside or inside of the walls that is trying to get rid of titan shifters like Eren.

That raises the question about Reiner, Berth, Ymir, and Annie. Aren't they shifters as well? Perhaps they are a different kind. I mean, they already knew they were Titans. They all had their reasons: Reiner and Berth wanted to go back to their village (which might actually be outside of the walls. If they really wanted to go back, they wouldn't have destroyed it in the first place by breaking the walls -_-), Annie's father, Ymir (no idea yet) but she apparently had something bad to do with Reiner and Berth (Will now refer to them as R_B). Going back a bit, Eren had a dream where his dad injected him with something and gave him a key and disappeared. Perhaps Eren is that of the prophecy.

Also, remember this: After 100 years, Titans invaded the first wall. Eren survived. Five years later, they do it again. Eren is revealed to be able to create a Titan Body, as some others are revealed to be. R_B say there is no more need to break walls and kidnap Eren.

So I believe the Titan's motive for eating people is this: To kill any ""human"" that may potentially be one of the new Titan Shifters or the second generation, which, indiscriminately, is all humans.

In Mythology, there were two generations of deities: The Titans and the Olympians. The titans battled it out with the second generation and lost. Perhaps the second generation is that of Eren? Apparently, only gods can kill other gods (in this case Titans) but there have been times where humans were able to wound the gods themselves (which applies to AoT where humans cut the nape of Titan neck).

So a question floating around is this: Is R_B/Annie/Ymir good guys or bad guys? Maybe its a combination of both. What will R_B do to Ymir and Eren? If their job (according to theory) is to kill Eren, why haven't they done it yet? Maybe they will reveal the true enemy of the series and help Eren achieve victory (thus fulfilling the prophecy). If the Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan no longer need to break down the walls after acquiring Eren, then the true conflict of the story lies around Eren, perhaps due to his power.

Ah, now here's something else:

According to the other story, Zeus was able to retrieve the other children that Cronos swallowed by causing the Titan to regurgitate the other children. Being gods, they were unharmed. The other five children thanked him and made Zeus their leader. Cronos and the Titans except about three of them fought to retain power. Atlas was their leader in battle and was winning a lot, but Zeus went to Tartarus and freed the cyclops and the Hecatoncheires (Titans with many heads and arms, I think about fifty to hundred each) and won.

If Eren is supposedly ""Zeus"", then that means the key must open something that would help Eren (Tartarus).

Again, all just theories n stuff. Probably a lot of holes. Too lazy to track it all down.

A side note:
What exactly are Titans? How do they form? They may have something to do with Gypsum, or ""white clay"", which coincidentally means ""Titan"" in some language I forgot (Greek? Latin?)

Gypsum is an evaporative mineral that is used in making sculptures. It sets and hardens quickly, which may have to do with the Titan's regenerative ability and why their bodies are always hot (so they don't harden). There is also crystal like kind of Gypsum, in which we see Annie being encased inside of a crystal.

Not only does this mean more content but that means we can get to the most trollish season-ending cliffhanger ever :D For all you manga viewers, here's an old post I made talking about the pacing for the remaining episodes of the season and so far, it's spot on so this is pretty good news:


&gt;There are three possible endpoints: Chapter 30 (scouting legion comes home defeated), Chapter 33 (Walls are Titans) or Chapter 34 (Wall Rose has been ""breached""). I would personally prefer it end on the last case. The first case is to dreary of ending and won't give people a reason to come back for more. The second case is a good cliffhanger but doesn't give an idea of what the next arc will be like. However, the last case both puts viewers on edge for more and will signal to anime viewers that a new and epic arc is beginning. 

&gt;Nonetheless, for it to reach that, the remaining nine episodes will have to cover 13 chapters. Talking with my brother and some friends (who are all anime only viewers), they felt that the pacing from episodes 1-8 was amazing, but they felt as though 9-13 was very slow paced. In a sense, they're right. The first 8 episodes covered nearly 13 chapters. By contrast, episodes 9-13 covered a little over five chapters. So basically, the first 8 episodes were paced at about 1.5 chapters per episode while 9-13 (and also 14-16, but that's a different case per say) were paced at 1-1. With all that said, we have two options, the 1.5 pacing and the 1-1 pacing. In order to get back to the awesomeness of the first 8 episodes (not saying the episodes after that were bad, but many anime-only viewers preferred these episodes..I actually loved some the episodes that came after), I think the anime team is going to go back to the original pacing. **With ALL that said, tl;dr, it's definitely possible for these last nine episodes to cover 13 chapters...they've done it before like I explained.**

&gt;Without further ado, here's my idea of the pacing:

&gt;Episode 17 - Explanation on the Formation of Enemy Detection. Introduction of the Female Titan (FT) including the close call with Reiner. (Other half of Chapter 22 and all of Chapter 23)

&gt;Episode 18 - Enter the Forest of Giant Trees and Eren's flashback with Hanji (Chapter 24 and part of Chapter 25)

&gt;Episode 19 - FT captured (Part of Chapter 25 and Chapter 26)

&gt;Episode 20 - FT commits suicide (Chapter 27)

&gt;Episode 21 - The Levi Squad dies and Eren begins his fight with FT (Chapter 28 and 29)

&gt;Episode 22 - Eren is defeated and FT gets away, the Scouting Legion comes home in disarray. (Chapter 29 and Chapter 30)

&gt;Episode 23 - FT is revealed to be Annie. Ends with Eren uppercutting Annie in titan form. (Chapter 31 and parts of 32)

&gt;Episode 24 - Eren v. Annie. Ends with the defeat of Annie and the revelation of the Walls. (Parts of chapter 32 and chapter 33)

&gt;Episode 25 - Ends with the ""breaching"" of Wall Rose. (Chapter 34)

We have all had our suspicions of the possible identity of the Ape Titan, well here is mine. This theory is only possible if the theory that the Titans were once weapons made by the earlier humans is true. If the Titans were once ancients weapons, we have to remember how weapons are made, specifically biological weapons. In biological weapon development certain milestones must be met before there is Human testing. What if, the ancient Humans first experimented on Animals, such as monkeys. What if, the Ape Titan is the first successfully made Titan from a monkey the closes link to Humans, without Human testing. Maybe the real identity of the Ape Titan is not that his is a shifter, but the surviving original test subjects. Well, that is one reason why I believe the Ape Titan is not human.
Secondly, why is it that the Ape Titan is covered in fur? All other Titans are hairless except for the Human like head of hair. And, all Titans, more visible with the shifters, have characteristics similar to the original user e.g.: Eren Titan, green eyes; Reiner Titan, blond hair; Annie Titan, blue eyes; Bertholdt Titan, ...tallest of the four? :p. The only advantages that I see with the fur of the Ape Titan is that he can keep himself warm during winters. But, Titans have no need for temperature control, one, because Titans are seemingly immortal and thus not need to control their temperatures, and secondly, Titans are already extremely hot to the touch.
Thirdly, this could explain why the Ape Titan was not aware of the 3d maneuvering gear, there would have been zero to no exposure to the gear, for he is a monkey, and at least in this universe Monkeys do not wear 3d maneuvering gear, unless if Isayama says so.
Ok, but why does the Ape Titan seem intelligent, well given that the Ape Titan has been given the gift of immortality for over 100 years maybe he would learn a thing or two. But, how come the Ape Titan is able to speak? 'Well,  I think that Titans can also speak, but they choose to ROAR, because they are hun...angry.

One thing I noticed in the manga was that Mikasa got some sort of symbol/marking on her right wrist from her mother.

I believe in the anime, the mother is showing Mikasa how to knit/embroider something, and she tells her that she has to pass this down to her children when she has them (leading to the stereotypical ""where do babies come from"" conversation). In the manga, I don't recall seeing any sewing, instead that Mikasa mentioning that ""it hurts"" and the mother finishing putting bandages on her arm. I think there were some tools on the table as well, such as a scapel.

The mother (who we know is the last ""pure Asian"") said that this mark/sewing pattern is part of Mikasa's clan/family. We've never seen this mark revealed or mentioned ever again, which I feel is odd, since pretty much everything else in the story has some level of importance.

So is this ""clan"" being a general grouping of the Asian race? Or is it a smaller family/clan (such as the Uchihas in Naruto)? Could it have some special meaning or power to it?

1374763939.0,10,self.ShingekiNoKyojin,1j137w,Anyone feels the pacing of the story is really fast? [SPOILER],moumouren,13,3,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1j137w/anyone_feels_the_pacing_of_the_story_is_really/,"I just finished reading all of the chapters of the manga in one night (haha) after discovering this amazing series, and everything about it just seems to exceed my expectations. However, my one gripe is that, ironically, there was so much good material that the pace of the story moved faster than the medium can deliver in a comfortably paced manner.

Let my illustrate. At first we get a sleepy village which is protected by giant walls from large hostile creatures called Titans. The wall gets breached, hero wants vengeance, becomes a soldier, discovers superpowers yada-yada normal drama. He becomes the center of attention of the powers-that-be (episode 14), and I start to get excited for the series because it's starting to show some real plot development, from being merely humans vs monsters to the internal political struggle between humans. So things proceed as expected, hero needs to prove himself, goes out to fight monsters, FINDS INTELLIGENT FEMALE TITAN! WOW! AMAZING! Things go south, hero returns home, hangs head in shame.

At this point, things suddenly start to ramp up *RAPIDLY*. All of a sudden, out of the blue, Annie is revealed to be the *female type titan*. I mean, there was basically no setup for this at all. Barely 5 chapters ago we just realised that it was even possible for a human to be inside a Titan; the humans basically had never even come close to understanding a thing about the titans before, and all of a sudden the most badass enemy by far is actually one of the main characters, *inside freaking Wall Shina*? If I remember my thoughts when I was reading at this point, Wall Shina was supposed to be the final safe haven for all of humanity, the last line of defense. From the way the story was set up from the beginning, it was supposed to be a major plot vehicle to move the plot forward, and that just seemed to have been ignored. There just seemed to be so much wasted potential with it, like demonstrating the rich-poor divide between Wall Rose and Wall Shina, or the potential civil conflict which could have arised. That could have been a whole storyline on its own. 

Ok, so that's just the first ""arc"". That's okay, let's just move on. Suddenly, utterly without any explanation at all, we find out that the WHOLE ENTIRE WALL is revealed to be lined up with  titans. I mean, we had just realised that it was possible for a human to turn into a Titan not too long ago, and NOW we're seeing the WHOLE WALL is filled with titans. I'm not saying there wasn't a logical way to lead up to this, but don't you think that it's freaking fast to reveal something of this magnitude so abruptly? I'd expected something like this to be revealed at some point when and if Wall Shina was on the verge of collapse, or the humans were facing an inevitable civil war, or something. Now Wall Shina has basically became irrelevant, in terms of its defensability against the titans. This just came out of nowhere and slapped you in the face.

Ok, so now we know that Wall Shina is lined with titans, that's the second ""arc"". Let's say we accept that. Suddenly Wall Rose is allegedly breached and the titans are invading the lands, implying that it's just a matter of time until Wall Shina will be breached (I expected this part to be at least 2/3 way down the entire storyline by this point). New gorilla titan appears, Wall Rose is in fact not breached, Ymir is a titan. All cool. Then all of a sudden, the epicenter of the whole story, the entire reason for the whole series, the COLOSSAL TITAN AND ARMOURED TITAN IS REVEALED! HOOO SHIT! And guess what? THEY WERE REINER AND BERTHOLDT THE ENTIRE TIME! WHHHAAAATTTTT??? Aren't they supposed to be, like you know, the final bosses or something? Plus the way they revealed themselves was so meh. Like, hey Eren, you know what, we're actually the bane of humanity's entire existence (actual quote). Like it was just a matter of fact or something.

So I guess my question is, don't you think that by normal manga standards, the plot is advancing way too fast? If this were Naruto or FMA, there would have been at least double the content's worth of material in between each of these ""arcs"" (I'm using the term loosely). I'm not saying the story is not masterfully done, it certainly keeps exceeding my expectations over and over; I'm just saying there seems to be so much wasted potential in between these points. Sorta like the opposite of filler. We could have had the epic internal struggle between the rich and the poor. We could have had the dawning horrifying realization that there were in fact titans among us. We could have seen a build up towards the indestructible Wall Shina being finally seen as mortal, and then as the enemy. There just seems to be so much wasted opportunity which can never be clawed back. I mean, on hindsight sure it may seem like that's just the way things went. But when you're reading it in foresight, don't you think that the pacing is rather fast?

IF YOU ARE NOT UP TO DATE IN THE MANGA SHINGEKI NO KYOJIN STOP READING. DO NOT READ IF YOU ONLY WATCH THE ANIME VERSION TITLED ATTACK ON TITAN, AS THE EPISODES ARE NOT CAUGHT UP TO THE MANGA YET**


As you know (if you are up to date in Shingeki no Kyojin) in chapter 34, it is revealed that the walls of the cities are built around colossal titans. Only those in the cult that believe that the walls are an act of god know the true origin of the walls and why the titans are inside the walls.
My theory on why the walls are built around titans is as followed
I believe that humanity has had the ability to turn humans into titans long before the enemy titans even existed. The humans created the technology to turn humans into titans to create the walls to defend from another opposed force at the time (another tribe or group of humans). The preferred size was the colossal size (40-50 meters) and the imperfect, smaller titans where cast away when the walls were completed. They may have contributed to the walls being built by bringing materials but they could not stack them. Seeing as the colossal titans would be a threat they were build into the wall in a restrained position.
I believe that when the walls were completed the smaller titans were exiled and left outside of the walls along side the other humans and after all the time the outside humans developed a bond along side the exiled titans and the outer humans developed the technology to create the same human-titan hybrids and are now seeking revenge on the humans within the walls. I think the serum or whatever it takes to create on of these titan hybrids is injected into the neck and that results in the weak spot.

To know some characters are ""in"" on it, but with any conspiracy we don't know how *much* each player knows.  One person who is ""in"" eyeballs-deep is Eren's father, and I want to open up speculation on a particular quote from him:

http://www.mangahere.com/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/c001/44.html

&gt; The ship will be there soon.  I'll be on my way now.

This was in the first chapter, before the attack.  The timing is suspicious to begin with.  I should add that he said he's off to town for examinations before he said that.  Well, that's probably a lie.  We know that the SnT world has ships, and these became useful very quickly during the evacuation.  Ostensibly, he could have been saying that he'll take a ship into the inner walls, like into Trost, or further.  Or he could have been traveling a shorter distance in Shiganshina, although this is unlikely since there's only one river and horse travel should be more direct.

The alternative speculation.... is that he's going *the other way*

Recall [the discovery](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1gdc48/my_theory_about_the_titans_spoilers/) of hidden upside down Japanese text that told of the origins of the wall.  That is, humans sailed to a new continent and found the walls already made.  We know there are communities of humans and/or shifters outside the walls.  What if these are on the ""old"" continent?  Additionally, R/B arrived *from* the ""old"" continent in titan form to destroy the wall right about the time Grisha was (speculatively) setting off *to* the ""old"" continent.  The [strong form](http://forums.mangafox.me/threads/288290-Official-Theories-Thread?p=12053185&amp;viewfull=1#post12053185) of this theory is that Grisha is getting orders from the Ape Titan, or at least they're both getting orders from the same people.  It would also follow that the plague he cured was related to his dealings with these people.

I find the current evidence to be pretty weak, but I'm trying to frame things in terms of continents as best I can, and this fits what we want.  Speaking of which, the name of the Wall Shina could possibly [refer to China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shina_%28word%29).  In Japanese ""Shina"" is derogatory, but it's also just a root sound for Chinese things, also used in English as Sino, as in Sino-US relationships.  Maybe this is a signal saying ""this is in China"".  After all, the people living within the walled areas *came from another continent*, and we know that Asians are basically extinct, except for Mikasa.

This is embarrassingly cliche, but you know, ancient China is known for building a big wall.

* Colossal Titan is obviously another Titan-changing human, the ""poof"" effects were identical

* There is a possibility that Armoured Titan is a human as well (plot device: he got a name), but I'd rather him not be one since this floats dangerously close to a situation where Eren is one of shipload of half-Titans, and, knowing how it is an anime, we've seen all of their ""secret identities"" already (but this would be downright retareded and I still have hope that AoT is something more than that, a man can dream)

* The Titan attack might be some kind of revenge for obliterating the rest of humanity, I still haven't figured why it took 100 years to bounce back, though

So we can all pretty much agree titans originate from people being injected by this ""serem"" of some sort to make them strong and regenerate, etc. But Titans only came about ~120 years ago, back when humans were dominant.

Some evidence/points that i build my theory off:

* Much is unknown of outside world (like everything)
* Orangutitan is intelligent, never has seen 3D gear (Mostly everyone within walls should have)
* Orangutitan has different appearance and intelligence than normal dumb titans (who i'll call ""normies"")
* Bertholt, Reiner and Annie also have different titan appearances and are intelligent, asume all 3 are from outside world (same place of origin as orangutitan). Annie says she's from far away. 
Reiner and Bertholt from same place, ""small village that got attacked before we knew it"" is bullshit story, but they are from same place. When asked motivation for joining cadets, Bertholt: ""To join royal guard ""(elminate royalty cuz war going on?) Reiner: ""I just want to go to home that was taken from me.""
* We know the walls were built by colossals (how/why?)
* Basement contains ""Their memories that should help Eren find/control his power""
* Dr. Jaeger travelled all over, presumably developing this titan serem. Now missing, hiding?
* Annie/BH/Reiner's mission was to ""eliminate everyone"" until Eren turned titan, it is then capturing him. 

***So here's the theory:***

* Eotans were a weapon developed by an entirely different faction, far away from the walls. ***I am calling this faction, Titan (From: Attack on Titan)***
* Titan became able to create titans and multiple types of supertype Eotans as soldiers (Annie, Reiner, etc.)
* Titan invaded the Monarchy (which used to have tonnes of land) and instead of committing genocide, they agree to allow the royalty and people to live within the walls(as livestalk/test experiments) in the walls they'd build using their colossal titans.
* Rather than die, the cowardly Monarchy accepts defeat and goes into the walls. It being the Royalty and The Religion's job to keep people from questioning the outside world,  and just exist within the walls. All knowledge of outside world is erased in process.
* To keep the oppressed from exploring outside the walls and finding Titan/learning anything, Titan creates unintelligent ""normies"" to wander around the walls, killing any humans who venture out, this is their sole purpose. Also, perhaps these test subjects who don't possess the mental fortitude to overcome Eotan's impulsive instinct.
* Dr. Jaeger knows the truth, and spends the entirety of his research trying to recreate the serem in order to level the playing fields. Plausible as Dr. seems to have many close ties to important people, ex. commander who trained Eren
* ""Memories"" are old documents written by the people back when Titan attacked the Monarchy. Possibly containing more information about titan abilities, too early to say.

Now for some reason I don't know, having the Monarchy continue to exist is becoming problematic for Titan, so the orders are to break down the walls and eliminate everyone. 
Once this happens, Dr. Jaeger realises nows the time to act, and gives his version of the serem to his son Eren in order to start the resistance. 
Once Eren becomes a titan, the focus is now on capturing him. As it is unknown to Titan how the Monarchy came to possess the same serem. 
With Eren now a playing card, and the Monarchy beginning to learn more and more about the titan's tendency's (and attack the gate strategy), Titan throws in a wildcard by having the Orangititan climb the walls and sneak into Connie's village and inject them all with the ""normie serem."" While doing this, the Orangititan discovers the 3D gear and bring's it back to Titan. 

Now the question remains as to why Annie, Bertholt, Reiner never reported the existance of 3D equipment to Titan which is either because:

* They couldn't find a way to leave the wall undiscovered
* They're secretly also plotting against Titan. Since a human from the Monarchy was able to turn titan, they wanna let Eren in on it since maybe they can start their own Titan army. Reiner did say ""His home was taken from him"", so maybe Titan's methods for creating Eotans isn't fair to the ""test subjects"", so to say considering there are child/babylike Eotans.. 

Now this doesn't mean they can just inject the serem into everyone and they're all intelligent and willful. Even Eren became overcome by it and attacked Mikasa right? So only certain people have the mental resolve to control this abilty. 

Any thoughts? This is definitely not complete so I'd love to hear anything you guys might want to contribute.

***TL;DR:***
Monarchy got attacked by faction with ability to create Titans. Created walls for the Monarchy to live in as livestalk/test subjects.
Jaeger creates serem to make own titans and begin the resistance.

Just hear me out. This explains the title of first episode, ""To you, 2000 years from now""


**MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD**



When Eren wakes up from his dream in first episode, in the Manga, [Mikasa said ""See you Later, Eren"" and out of blue, he asks her if her hair has gotten longer.](http://www.mangareader.net/shingeki-no-kyojin/1/19) This, first of many forshadowing that the author throws at us might give us some insight. My theory is that 2000 years from now, in about 2800, the world is still the same. SnK's world is inspired by the Viking mythology, as shown in many references throughout the story and names of certain characters. For instance, Armin talks about the outside world; Sea of flames and Field of Ice. Which, if you look for it in the Norse(viking) Mythology, it exist the outside of Midgard and [JÃ¶tunheimr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6tunheimr) - a fucking world of giant. Sea of flames is called [Muspelheim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BAspellsheimr), and Field of ice (plane of ice?) is called [Niflheim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niflheim) In Norse Mythology, they build a wall against the giants. with the eyelash of [Ymir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ymir) - incidently a name of a character in the SnK. When Ragnarok happens in Norse Mythology, those giants break down the wall and kill the gods...basically, SnK. Ymir is the primeval being, the very first being in the Norse Mythology whom of which killed by Odin and other major gods. In death, Ymir's body create the world. Gods try to protect themselves and humans from the giants by making the wall. This is the part of Norse Mythology SnK uses. 

Back to SnK, world creation is probably similar to the Norse Mythology. Ymir - some primeval being - was killed and remnant of it was scattered across the world. In year 700, the remnant was found by a young scientist (Eren's father.) He experimented on it, and extracted a virus to titan-fy things. Some plants that he experimented on create the gigantic forest outside the walls of SnK. The nation start to investigate on the Remnant of Ymir and create the Titans. The nation decide to use the Titans as a part of their conquest. ""The world without conflicts"" (On the cover of a second book, the map has upside down writing that reads that) It was simple, they build the walls to protect themselves safely inside, and spread the giants outside to devastate everyone else. They probably had some sort of vaccine that will kill Titans. From the beginning, I was wondering how the walls were conveniently built once Titans appeared. Walls were under construction by the royalties in secrecy, and when they released the Titans, they just lead the survivors and escape into the pre-built walls. The plan was wait it out until the titans outside devastate the other nations - they are only interested in killing human - and kill the titans by spreading the vaccine. All this project, for the convenience, I will call it Ragnarok Project.

However, they needed a messenger. sort of a like a bird in Noah's Ark. They needed to know when they can come out. So they created Titans with intelligence and who can become human at will. They created those straints of titans, however they only had vaccines to eliminate titans - in which will kill the messenger titans also.

In short, there's two kinds of titans. ones that were created initially, one without any intelligence of sort and no way of going back to Human. And another one that can become human at will.

The plan was perfect, the speed of devastation was unimaginable. However, they evolved. Some of them gained intelligence. They now have their own agenda - to create the world of giants. Titans with intellignce tried and succeed in killing the scientist and the vaccine.

Those messenger titans - one that can revert back to human - create their own nation outside the walls. If needed, they can change back to titan form, so the protection is ok. Reiner and Bertolt told Eren of where they came from - outside of wall. Well, they were revealed to be titans in manga. 


To clarify, there's 5 major powers in this world now.

1. Humans and royalties who created Titans (Midgard, Asgard)

2. Titans without intelligence

3. Titans with Intelligence (JÃ¶tunheimr)

4. Messenger Titans who joined JÃ¶tunheimr. (Ymir)

5. Messenger Titans who created their own nation. (Reiner, Bertolt, Annie)


Anywho, the scientist had a son, Eren, who had the vaccine. However, Eren didn't know or didn't have guts to use the vaccine. In order to do so, he will have to come forward with the vaccine and expose himself. He hid it in the lab of his father and waited till he can use the vaccine. However, in 850's, he was killed by Titans and the vaccine and the location of the lab is lost. The Ragnarok Project that began in 700s, is continuing without any way of ending it. This state of entrapment of human continues for 2000 years. And by then, almost all titans have intelligence. However, the world is already theirs, and they saw no reason to breach the final wall. Those royalties and survivors tried to come up with a way to kill Titans. Due to the constraint of the wall, humanity was unable to build any substantial weaponary against the titans. Also, they failed to produce the vaccine again since they were unable to capture the titans in any shape or form and also, anyone who gets close to the answer gets killed by the titans. Finally, the vaccine and the virus are both created from the remnant of Ymir, which discovered in 700, only the scientist who discover can know of it back then, so in year 2700s, they can't figure it out. However science advanced regardless. They gathered as much resources as possible in a hope that one day they might come up with a plan. 

At one point in history, they find a letter - ""To you, 2000 years from now."" Written by Eren in 850's. This letter, explained the plan that humanity is going to do. They create the time machine with all the resources and scientific advances combined. The purpose of the time machine is to send assassin into 700s to kill the Eren's father before he create the Titan virus. However, for some unknownreason this fails, and the future fails to change. In year 2800, the titans attacks human one last time and humanity comes to an end.



At the year 2800s, the descendant of Mikasa send her son, Eren, back to the past in a hope to save him from the Titans. She sends him off with her final word ""See you later, Eren."" It is impossible even for her son, Eren's eye. This is why he cries when he wakes up. I assume that Mikasa's name was passed down to her descendents. Since she is...quite obsessive of Eren, she probably wished that the son of her lineage will be called Eren, and daughter Mikasa. However in time warp, only the memory warp back.


Due to the nature of the travel, the original Eren's memory and 2800's Eren's memory collide with one another, and he only feels as if he was dreaming. However, since Mikasa's lineage is quite unique (Oriental) future Eren's mother, Mikasa, is similar enough to past Eren's Mikasa. I guess the future one had short hair, that's why he asks her about the hair when he wakes up.

Eren's father, the shots that he gave to Eren, was to protect Eren from the danger of Titans. He made it so that Eren will be like Messenger Titans. Also, he disrupts Eren's memory of location of his lab and what is in there (most likely vaccine)


In 850's, Eren's memory finally collides, he realizes the fate of humanity in the future. He hurries to the lab only to realize it is already ransacked. He was already surrounded by titans. knowing that there's no way out, he writes to the future that he came from the future and back to 800s, but he failed, so that future humans should send assassin to year 700 instead to kill his father instead. This is the letter, ""To you, 2000 years later""

In future, the letter is found. In year 2800, they send assassin back in 700s, and failed. In the brink of extinction of humanity, Mikasa send her son, Eren, back in time just to save him. The loop continues on.



Back to the Norse Mythology, after killing gods, the titans set the world on fire. However, the fire is not for the destroying, it is for cleansing the world. 

In SnK, this could mean that the titans are the bringer of the new future, the cleanser of the world instead of mindless devastation.. but this might be too hopeful.


TL;DR

1. The SnK's world is in Time loop without the possibility of multiverse. In the end, the humanity is extinct.

2. In 700s, the scientist finds the Remnant of Ymir (the primeval being) and create the virus. The royalty of current nation in SnK weaponize them by creating Titans and Messenger titans that will tell the end of devastaion outside the wall. However, they lose the vaccine that will eliminate Titans. Only ones that know the whereabouts of the vaccine is Eren and his father. However when Eren finally reaches the lab, lab is ransacked (probably by intelligent titans) and Eren is killed

3. Eren, knowing the truth about him writes the letter, ""To you, 2000 years from now,"" before his death that soon follows. In the future, when humanity find the letter, they realize the possibility of time travel and create time machine. They send back the assassin into 700s to kill the Scientist, but fails. Titans are created. In 2800s, Mikasa sends her son, Eren, back to the past to save him from the Titans and the history repeats itself.

Here's my new theory. The ape titan has shown that it can invade with impunity and create titans within the walls. It's no exaggeration to say that it could wipe out humanity by itself if it that was its true motivation.

Bert and Reiner seemed to know the ape titan. Annie is afraid for her life despite being able to transform into a 15-meter tall killing machine. Bert and Reiner both seem conflicted about what they're doing. Also the line about ""Do you really think this world can last"".

So in series, these attacks accomplished the following:

 - connected Shiganshina District with titan territory
 - connected the area between wall Maria and Rose with titan territory

But that left 3 towns within Wall Maria isolated!!  They're still protected by their own walls!  Humans fled to within Wall Rose (with major causalities), but wouldn't you have remained safe if you stayed within one of those other 3 towns?  For all we know, if you ventured out that far and managed to get over the wall, you could hang out there in perfect peace.  This seems perfectly obvious if you look at a map of the walls:

http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/File:About_the_Walls_Pt2.jpg

Have these towns even been named?  They've been isolated for 5 years.  What if they could be host to isolated societies?  Couldn't you travel between them by moving along the top of the wall, like we've seen several times in the manga?

Where in the manga did it give information about Reiner Braun's hometown?  I can't tell if it was stated to be one of the 4 outer towns of Wall Maria or if it was within it.  This is thought to be a lie, but what it if wasn't?  What if that's the hometown he's trying to return to, which still has a human population because it's shielded from the titans?

What if breaching the walls, and leaving isolated towns in groups of 3 was the plan to radicalize the population and prepare them to fight the government in the center?  Or eventually just let the center be devoured?  If the more recent attack on Trost had succeeded we would have 6 isolated towns.

After all, someone in Shiganshina had the shifting technology (Eren's father).  If you count Reiner's faction then R+B+A+Eren = 4.  Since the gate was the weak point R/B/A had no choice but to sacrifice Shiganshina in their revolution... but they didn't count on Eren's father using the technology like he did.  The creators of the wall knew the government was corrupt, so they entrusted 1 person in each wall-town with the shifting tech.  We don't know where Ymir was from, except that she was in *Trost*!  This would predict there are 3+4=7 more shifters we don't know about yet.

First of all, hey everyone. I'm a newbie here. I was introduced to Attack on Titan sometime this week by a guy named Quuon on narutoforums. Watched the five episodes of the anime and went on to catch up to all the manga chapters. I just finished late last night and my mind was so fucked my brain shut down and I just went to sleep. 

This is possibly the best show/manga I have have experienced..It literally has everything you would want from action, to amazing characters and character development, to beautiful scenery, to orgasmic music, to a complex plot and mind screwing plot shocks and twists, to drama and even comedy. So It's say to safe that I have become an addict and that I'm enjoying myself quite a lot. Only qualm I have right now...is the monthly releases :/ 

But still, I have a quite a few questions after marathoning the manga.

1. Are we supposed to know yet why Annie, Reiner, and Berthold are traitors?

2. If Berthold and Reiner (Colossal Titan and Armored Titan) can so easily make breaches in the walls...why did they stop attacking mankind five years ago? And why did they go through the trouble of infiltrating the human population?

3. Is only Wall Shina made by Titans or are the other walls made like that as well? Because when the Colossal Titan breached the walls around  Shiganshina,you couldn't any titans.

4. One last thing, what's the deal with Ymir eating someone from Reiner's flashback? Was this explained or..?

I have some questions!

1) In chapter 46 or so, Reiner tells Bertholdt to confess to Annie. I was just wondering if anyone noticed any instances of Bertholdt staring at Annie. I only noticed one, when she was walking away after Irvin's (de)motivational speech to the recruits - are there any others?

2) Is it just me, or is it hinted that Eren might have a slight crush on Annie? I understand that it's established that Eren is attached to her - we see that through the flashbacks - just as he's attached to Reiner, but that strange scenario between Annie &amp; Mikasa that he recollects seemed like it had overtures of romance in it. Am I the only one who thinks this, or am I just slow on the uptake? Eren is a pretty asexual protagonist, and the hints of a romance between him and Mikasa are basically one-sided, so I know it's a stretch. 

3) Speaking of Annie, in the Special Chapter that introduces Levi, I kind of thought that the first page was weird: [here's a link to it](http://i.imgur.com/FSzoXv6.jpg). Does that child look a little bit like Annie? I know it might contradict what we know about Annie's backstory, but since what we know about Annie/Bertholdt/Reiner is part of their ruse...it also seemed strange because the bottom-left panel needlessly focuses on her face. I don't think Isayama does many needless things. Anybody agree or disagree?

4) Does Pixis lead the Stationary Guard? It seems like he does, but I just want to be sure, because it feels like his status is a little strange. Maybe I just have bad reading comprehension, or it's because Pixis' military role also involves a level of civil administration?

5) Is the beginning of Chapter 39, where a smaller titan knocks down and attacks an equally small titan, supposed to have some sort of significance? Like, the titans that arose during the Ape Escape (hurr), just as they can wallow around during the night, are also ""cannibalistic"" (in terms of just attacking other titans)? I don't follow why the other titans managed to group together and attack the tower in such large clusters if that's the case.

Alright so I found another interesting little thing while reading the manga:

http://www.batoto.net/read/_/170024/shingeki-no-kyojin_v11_ch45_by_tdx/24

Read this page. Now, what I found very interesting was that Bertholdt swallowed two people: Ymir and an unnamed soldier -- He swallowed them at the same time. Yet on this page we have Bertholdt carrying Ymir and using the 3DMG of the soldier he ate. This begs the question...when Titan Shifters (and maybe Titans themselves) eat humans, can the humans inside the Titan's nape interact with the eaten human (if they were eaten whole). 

This just might explain how Ymir became human again. I'm theorizing big here...but what if the process of becoming ""human again"" (titan shifter) involves eating whole a titan shifter and then interacting with that titan shifter inside the body of the titan.

It's clear in this page I just showed that Bertholdt did a lot inside of his body. He stripped the 3DMG of the soldier and took Ymir. The only plausible way this could have occured is if he interacted with them while they were inside his body.

I'm really digging it. Not just the, the anime looks really damn sharp along with the coloring. I was afraid I was losing interest in Anime/Manga since I only keep up to date with Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Berserk and Claymore. Also I'm really into MMA and to see the MMA moves in the battle with Eren and Reiner got me more into this series. Fun fact, the author said he based Reiner's armored Titan on Brock Lesnar, a professional wrestler and former UFC MMA Fighter. This whole week I've been non-stop reddit and wikia for Shingeki no Kyojin. Also I told 2 of my co workers to check it out so I hope they get into it as well.

Now onto the series!

After watching the first episode of the anime, It looked more clearer to me but could Eren see the future from his dream? After catching up to the manga, it hasn't shown this ability (unless i'm missing something) but does anyone think his Precognitive dreaming ability will play a part in why Bertholdt and Reiner kidnapped Eren?

______________________________________________________________________


Hello all!

So the subreddit has finally breached 100 subscribers and well under way to 200. I pretty much expected this quick growth for this subreddit as the I was sure that many people will fall in love with the series.

So to celebrate, I have implemented a new header and logo. Both will be changed occasionally the further we get into the series anime-wise to lessen the spoilers. 

The header is optimized for a 1920 horizontal resolution. Here's a link to the image used for those who can't view it fully: http://i.imgur.com/PbwukJf.png

Do you guys like it? Hate it? Have something better in mind? Let me know and let's talk it out.

In the future, I will do some contest and giveaways as well as more guest passes.

Anyways, that is it for now. Let me know if you have any questions. :D

I know when they lost Wall Maria, they had to let thousands die so that everyone else won't starve to death. I couldn't find the exact numbers/percentages on the wiki, but it was still in the tens of thousands and we can use that to extrapolate the ""max"" population they had when they lived in the 100 year peace.

We can also see that there's still large chunks of land within Wall Maria that were never used for farming, so it's not like the max population was starving to death. But how much land do you need to support the ""max"" peace time population? 

Also, we know they hunt: We see Mikasa's father return with a goose he shot in a flashback, as well as [Spoilers](/m ""Sasha's family/clan are effectively all hunters/trappers."")

Obviously it is for attack on titan. Before I continue more I have a disclaimer:

**Due to the nature of the world of Attack On Titan, you can DIE. Dead is dead. It will be balanced out so first people that join probally will not get permadeath, but once we view it to be as balanced as possible, if you die, you stay dead. The way around this is to create a new char.**

A system is forming and will be smoothed out as more people join to act as beta testers. The main parts of the RP goes as follows:

* It will be text heavy. That means you will need to be specific in your RPing so you can get the best outcome.

* Combat is more based on text and RPing than actual equipment and skills(Skills do exist though). This was done due to there being only 1 weapon to kill titans with.

* You can join whoever you want and start wherever you want. Want to be in a small hunting village? Go ahead. Want to join the police force? Go ahead. Want to be in the scouting legion? Go ahead. Of course some will not be joining right from the get go and you must train to get it in.

* You can become a human that can change into a Titan. Once you create your char you can roll for a 5% chance to become one. In this, it will bolster your stats. AS OF NOW THERE ARE NO SPECIALTY TYPE TITANS(i.e. colossus and armored.)

* The World will be a spin-off from the actual one. No main chars will exist in this. And we will take artistic liberty in some of the mysteries of the series we do not know the answers to just yet.

For more on combat and stats go [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lWpfEVMG9yBzHng2EDgeilgDRrRRfEBaA5YGO0M4lFI/edit)

If you feel convinced by my little info session and want to join go to [r/Attackontitanrp/](http://www.reddit.com/r/AttackOnTitanRP/)

More info will be there and posted there. This is still a big work in progress and so any questions can be posted here and we will answer them. Also if anyone wants to offer help that would be great!

I'm talking something that can actually propel people around.  No, I'm not dumb enough (or smart enough) to build one, I'm just curious if it is *possible*.

I'm leaning toward no, but I'm not exactly a mechanical engineer so I was wondering what more knowledgeable people think.  I think certainly most components of it are possible.  This is purely about if a real life implementation is viable, not how they make them in the anime.

Here's the parts I think just wouldn't work:

* The grappling hooks/anchors/whatever they're called.  I get that they must have some mechanism to ""latch into"" something after they pierce it (like maybe when the tether to them is pulled tight?) and another to release (cause how else could they ever get them out?)... And they're obviously very sharp, since they can stab right through a titan's finger... But I still think this is the weak link of the whole system.  How could they pierce into even a tree and latch on strongly enough to hold a human swinging from them at such speeds?  And piercing/holding onto brick buildings is even more insane.  Shooting those anchors out at the required speeds seems impossible too.  But maybe I'm wrong...

* Compressed gas tanks being able to do that much work.  Obviously the compressed gas powers the whole system, shooting the grappling hooks, reeling people in, and providing thrust.  Presumably holding the line taught can be done simply by squeezing a handle or something, so let's assume they don't need gas for that.  Even then, can 2 of those tanks really hold enough gas to last anywhere near as long as shown, doing everything they do?  It seems like they'd blow their load after about 5 seconds.

* Human reflexes.  Human bodies can handle swinging at those speeds, there are circus acts that do similar things.  However, trapeze artists don't have to deal with a fuckton of randomly placed walls waiting to pancake them, much less actually planning ahead where to anchor themselves to swing in such a way to not shatter their skeleton.  Even simple movement with the 3DMG would require some crazy abilities to survive once, much less reliably.

Is there anything I'm missing?  Are either of the first two of these actually possible?  Particularly the anchoring?",,False,self,t5_2we2n,1374166484.0,,,True,t3_1ikgfs,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1ikgfs/is_it_possible_to_construct_a_working_real_life/,

Great anime so far but I have 2 questions.

1. How long will this anime go on for? Is it more like a FMA Brotherhood like 50-100 episodes or more like a Shonen Big 3 300+ Ep with fillers when the anime goes on break? I've been trying to figure it out myself but it has potential for both imo. 

2. Should I read the manga. Before I get bombarded with HELL YEAH THE MANGA IS AWESOME, I just feel like the anime is so good that I want to be surprised when I see it, not when I read it. I was thinking about watching until the show goes on break but thats gonna be at least another 10 weeks right? I heard the first season is gonna have 25 episodes.

In the pages devoted to the scouting legion there was something I found rather odd , specifically this page here http://www.mangareader.net/shingeki-no-kyojin/1/12
since when have the scouts targeted specific titans?Even if it was Eren's dream it still makes no sense because how the hell would Eren know what a titan looks like(seeing as before they attacked he had never encountered one)?But what complicates things further (in my head at least ) is the resemblance of the ch1 titan to the ape titan http://www.mangareader.net/shingeki-no-kyojin/1/13
 &amp; http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130610152728/shingekinokyojin/images/7/75/Beast_Titan.png , if you look closely and exclude arm length the titan in ch1 has the same toned features ( knees , torso ,neck etc).In those frames they are also shown walking in the same manner (left foot first ,right foot mid walk, arms down).I can't explain the lack of hair other than hairless apes in reality that are completely bald and muscular like ch1 titan is, what completely destroys this idea is that the ape titan is drawn to be twice as big which, unless titans grow, means that this is simply a coincidence.Even if this is complete horseshit , one thing I would like to point out is that in the frames ch1 titan has he is always shown with smoke coming out of him , which in hindsight is what the author uses to indicate ""awakened"" titans(like when Berthodlt is first shown in titan form).So it must be that ch1 titan is human?",Manga Spoilers,True,nsfw,t5_2we2n,False,g,crab38,True,t3_1imtkn,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1imtkn/manga_spoilersan_observation_regarding_the_titan/,

We're gonna see titans with 3DM Gear. Here's my reasons why I believe it'll happen:  

* Hanji has stated that the body of a Titan is disproportionally light, making it at all viable for one to use 3DM Gear, of course a larger variant.

* I doubt the Ape Titan stole Mike Zakarius' 3DM Gear just for the purpose of looking at it. Possibly for him or someone else among the titans to develop something similar for the use of the intelligent titans. 

* If it's gonna come down a fight with the Colossal titan, they're gonna be met with some difficulties. The steam may be by passable for a Titan, unlike a human who cannot stand it, so basically Eren with titan 3DM Gear. Unless of course we see him dealt with in less violent ways. 

I am quite aware of how silly this is damnably sure it. The main flaw being that there barely are any places with obstacles large enough for a titan to utilize the 3DM Gear.

I'm a huge fan of the series, but there seems to be one glaring issue that I'm not sure if anyone has noticed or would be able to explain.  Maybe it even leads up to something?  In that case, theories ahead.

So, the characters in the show reiterate over and over again that titans can only be killed if they are sliced at the nape of their neck.  However, there are instances where those same characters mention that you cannot kill a titan if you blow their heads off.  This is both shown with the ""old drawings"" in the classroom section early on, where it shows people with canons blowing up titan heads.  Secondly, this is shown when [Spoilers](/m ""Eren-Titan"") swings SO HARD it lobs the head off one titan, then steps on the spinal cord of the same titan, seemingly killing it only then.  

If titans can only be killed by slicing the napes of their necks, how is *blowing off their entire head/neck* not effective? 

[Spoilers](/m ""my only theory is that every titan in existence has another human/being in them that must be at a lower part of the nape/spinal cord that has to be attacked.

These are some points that I pulled up, for anyone who's interested. 

Culture: My theory is that the final settlement is based in Europe. The environment seems to show that, what with the potatoes and such. However, the society uses a strange amalgam of all sorts of different European cultures, and some things are therefore messy when it comes to culture.

* The series uses distinctly European names. ~~Which frustrates me, sometimes, when people use mistranslated names like ""Yeager"" or ""Ervin"", but I'm not going to talk about that.~~ However, these names range in their origins. For example, ""JÃ¤ger"" is a definitively German name. However, ""Eren"" is a Turkish name. ""Grisha"" is a Russian nickname. ""Carla"" is the feminized form of Charles, which is Anglo-Saxon in origin. ""Levi"" is a Hebrew name, found in the Bible. While I'm not going to analyze every name in the series, many from then on have Germanic or Anglo-Saxon roots, further hinting at the European origin.

* Maria, Rose, and Sinaâthe names of the Wallsâare all European. ""Maria"" is an old-as-language name, basically, although it is assumed to come from the Greeks and then adopted by the Romans. ""Rose"" is the French variant of the Latin word ""rosa."" Finally, ""Sina"" comes from a multitude of European languages, and it's a little difficult to place. (It's interesting to note that ""Sina"" and ""Shina"" are the Japanese transliterations of the Chinese word for ""China"".)

Technology: The technology used seems to reflect a setting in the 19th century. HOWEVER, the 3D Maneuver Gear...
* Medieval cannonry.

* Canning, which is 19th century.

* Flintlocks, which are 18th century.

* Hypodermic syringe, which is 19th century.

* Cast-iron railways, which is an 18th century technology.

* Puddling furnaces, which is 19th century.

* The major anachronism, though, is the 3D maneuver gear. It uses advanced pneumatic technologyâit's the science of using gas to power things, and it's used in a lot of modern technology like pistons and stuff. The first successful pneumatic motor in our universe was produced in the 1870's. However, those were **big**. Certainly not the size that you could just strap a motor onto you like a fanny pack, because they were designed for trains. Since coal is never shown in the series, it can be assumed that they use pneumatic technology for all methods of transportation.

But then we still see titans within the walls after the recent Legion recruits take refuge in Castle Utgard.  
My theory is, maybe there were some humans left over outside the wall that managed to survive, but were turned into titans who were manipulated to attack Castle Utgard.  
Why do I say that?  
Notice how the monkey titan could *climb* the walls. I believe it was him that turned some humans into titans and made him launch an attack on Castle Utgard. Another piece of evidence that could support that is when Connie Springer [found a titan in a house of his village](http://www.mangareader.net/shingeki-no-kyojin/37/44). Maybe some people didn't escape and were turned into titans to attack the castle but that particular one wasn't able to do much because the human reacted to the serum incorrectly.

1374075760.0,4,self.ShingekiNoKyojin,1ihpal,"Attack on Titan Theory/Predictions, Manga Reader Level(***Heavy Spoilers***)",,7,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1ihpal/attack_on_titan_theorypredictions_manga_reader/,"***************HEAVY SPOILERS***************

I had a few AoT Predictions come to my head, so I figured I'd share them.

In one of the early episodes of Attack, there was a slide based on ""yeast"", ""alien yeast"", or whatnot.   I don't remember which episode but using this: My theory is that's how the Titans came to be.   Contact with this Yeast.   That's how the Ape Titan turned that village into a Titans within the wall(this theory based on, the immovable Titan resembling Connie's mom(was it Connie?).  

The theme I noticed: Titans have huge duality issues.  Reigner, Erin(both seem to forget their duality.) I will continue this: Reigner's ""murderer side"" is his ""warrior"", and their group are called ""The Warriors"", and from thus I will deduce that ""The Warriors"" are a heartless, lack compassion group of Titan Shifters, stuck on their ""Warrior personality"" by choice/peer pressure?  

Back to the yeast: the yeast is the reason that ""humanity"" is doomed.   All the Warriors gotta do is sprinkle this yeast on everyone within the city, and voila: everyone's a Titan.  

I will guess that once you transform into a Titan, you naturally turn ""Warrior"" style personality, just a drive to eat(I will theorize that: the more humans a titan eats, the sooner it can turn back to Human(theory based on Ymir's 60 years of eatting, then 17 year old girl))

The secret behind the wall: I'll guess since we have a huge duality theme, the guys who opposed the warrior's ""heartless"" ideology, formed the Walls, because they chose the humanity, compassionate, emotional side vs. the Warriors.   I would believe that Dr. Jaeger was head or part of the department in working on making stronger Titan yeast to combat the Warriors.   He injected his own son, and left the research data, because the war has begun, and he was out of time.

The Wall, I'll guess, was made by the group of people opposing the Warriors, at a major sacrifice to strength, or entrapped Warriors, tricked into forming the wall as they attempted to attack and convert the last bastion of humanity. 

One last theory: The Warriors could also be Titans that refuse to turn human, and gain compassion, and stay in their heartless mode.

That's my theories regarding the show.  Thanks for reading.  ^.^

Edit: Theory on the Ape Titan: It's Dr. Jaeger but stuck in his ""Warrior"" personality.

Edit2: Theory based on those opposing the Warriors: another group of Titan shifters, but more original humanistic: avoid eatting humans, caring for fellow humans.   They didn't tell the public the truth because of a possible panic, and didn't attempt to convert everyone to Titans because they believed the human/original way of life is better, as opposed to boasting over wielding the power of a strong titan.",Manga Spoilers,False,self,t5_2we2n,1374076092.0,g,,True,t3_1ihpal,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1ihpal/attack_on_titan_theorypredictions_manga_reader/,
