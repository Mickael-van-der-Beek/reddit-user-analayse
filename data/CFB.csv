This sub is growing rapidly and is currently approaching 50,000 members. As a site grows it becomes more difficult to moderate and allow thought provoking discussion as well good content to make it to the front page. With this in mind as well as recent events, here are a few reminders about how we can all make this a better subreddit for everyone.

* There is no real test, but single image posts are usually judged by their face value relation to cfb, potential to create *thoughtful* discussion, and lack of ""karma-grab"" content. This is objective and varies from mod to mod, but I think gives a general idea of what we look for **Example:** a pic of a teams new helmet is on it's face cfb related, possibly thought provoking considering the reports on uniforms having large affects on recruiting etc. and is 50/50 on the karma grab analysis. This it normally left to user downvote/upvote. HOWEVER, Pic of old Mascot is only possibly on it's face related(depending on what the mascot looks like and image title), not likely to promote thoughtful discussion, and seems heavily karma-grab like. These posts are normally removed. 

* Memes, Gifs, Stadium shots and like have specific subreddits and threads. Moreover, if you have an idea such as ""old mascots"", a self-post thread where everyone can post images of their old mascots is likely to be allowed to live if people are upvoting it. The main page is meant to be an uncluttered space with many stories and ideas represented. 

* **USE THE REPORT BUTTON**: The easiest way to let the mods know about something is to report it. Reposts, Rule Violations, Etc. hit report and then if you can, message us to let us know what's going on. We don't see everything, but if it's reported it shows up to the mods.

* **YOU** have the power. The biggest thing to remember is that you have the power to upvote and downvote as well as report content. The content that makes the front page is dictated by the posts you upvote. The mods are very attentive to the report button, but a post with many upvotes is viewed as something the community wants to see so we are less likely to step in when so many subscribers clearly want something.

These are just a few items, but the main idea is that the mods feel we should be less a police force patrolling for questionable content and more a response force, removing things our sub does not want or need. Direct violations will always exist, but the large grey area that dominates most of our time is easily navigated with input from the users of this community.

Thank you for making this a great subreddit and helping us to continually improve it as well.

**TL;DR Upvote/Downvote/Report/Communicate with the Mods. This is the best way to regulate this community and your help is both needed and greatly appreciated.**

1336398161.0,967,self.CFB,tb52r,Swing Your Sword Reddit!

Hello Reddit,

**I am Mike Leach the new Head Football Coach of Washington State University (GO COUGS!)**

I hear you guys are a fun group to host a Q&amp;A so here I am.

Before Washington State I was Head Coach of Texas Tech University where I never had a losing season and went to 10 bowl games in 10 years and currently hold the record for most wins at that program. 

Besides being a Head Football Coach I am also the author of New York Times Best Seller: [“Swing Your Sword”](http://www.amazon.com/Swing-Your-Sword-Leading-Football/dp/0983337195/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336396645&amp;sr=8-1) that I co-wrote with Bruce Feldman of CBS Sports.  It’s a book about my experiences as a coach as well as the lessons I have learned in life along the way.  

In addition to that book I am also the co-editor of [“Sports for Dorks: College Football Volume 1”](http://www.amazon.com/Sports-For-Dorks-College-Football/dp/0615484972/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336396685&amp;sr=8-1) which is a series of books that bring together great minds to talk about College Football in different unconventional ways.  [The official blog](http://www.sportsfordorks.com/) run by co-editor Ferhat Guven always has interesting topics being discussed.  We will have 2 more books coming out this fall; another on college football and one on the NFL.

I always get asked about where to get the cool [Team Leach Pirate Flags](http://www.teamleach.org/) so here’s where you can get those.   All proceeds go to my scholarship fund to help students pay for school. We’ve already given away 10k last year and will do it again this year.

~~**I’ll be back at 12:00 PM Pacific to answer your questions.**~~  I can’t talk about any recruits or anything that would violate NCAA rules, but other than that ask me anything.

**GO COUGS!**

**Swing Your Sword!**

**-Mike Leach**



**Oh one more thing.** If you guys are interested there is a contest going on for the ESPN TV show College Gameday to film a commercial at the school with the most votes.  We are currently in 3rd place and are about 40,000 votes away from first.  I don’t know if there are 40,000 people on Reddit, or maybe you are just a really popular person with 39,999 friends, but it really would be great for us to win; every vote helps and is appreciated.  The show has never been to our campus so it would be a really big deal for us to win!

You can [vote here](http://www.gamedayvote.com/).  (It Requires a Facebook Login) just click on the Pac-12 conference and we are the one with the cool cougar head in crimson that looks like he’s about to take a bite out of somebody.

***********************************************************************************

**Hey guys this has been really fun, but I have to get back to working hard for Washington State.
Thank you all so much for all the great questions! I wish I had more time to answer more, maybe I'll see if I can circle back around and answer more if my schedule opens up later this evening or this week.   I can't say enough about how great everyone was here today, and I am really looking forward to seeing you all this fall! Thank you so much for taking the time to have me here today on Reddit. Here's a [picture of me with that alien thing you guys like](http://i.imgur.com/glIF3.jpg).**

Look, you can do whatever you want. This is just friendly advice that I feel a lot of other people here will agree with.

A lot of people graciously create game highlight videos for YouTube. What they don't realize is that we can't tell what's happening when you show the zoomed in replay angles, and the music choice is usually nauseating. We all think it's great you're having fun editing, but please keep in mind that if you're publicly posting game highlights to YouTube, people will likely find them and hope to see memorable plays as they happened. When they hit play and hear ""LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR"", they'll likely become frustrated and close the video.

If you're making a highlights video this fall after a game ends, thank you. You're awesome. But please do everyone a favor and upload a version with the interesting plays edited as they happened with the field sounds, commentary, etc. If you're taking the time to capture video, edit, upload, etc, if you do it the right way, you'll receive a lot of positive comments, subscribers and views.

For those of you who remember, I'm the one that did all the schedule posters from last year. I've decided to do it again, but instead of doing them about one conference a day, I've decided to just get them all done at once, and throw in a bunch of other stuff along with it.

_______________________________________________
**[Guide](http://imgur.com/a/Z9pIW)**
______________________________________________

This contains coaching changes, conference realignment in affect this year, logo changes, rule changes, guide to all the bowl games, and a way-too-early Heisman watch. (The missing conference realignment page has been replaced).

A note about the bowl games - The numbers correspond to the order the bowl committee gets to pick from that conference, it's not an automatic bid based on conference standings. For example, the Capital One Bowl gets second pick of Big Ten teams and the Outback Bowl gets third. Let's say Northwestern finished second in the standings, but Michigan finished third, or even fourth. The Capital One Bowl could still pick Michigan over Northwestern, knowing that the Wolverine fan base is much larger and will draw in a larger crowd, and therefore a higher profit. This is something I never really understood until recently, and I thought I'd pass it along. Feel free to correct any details I have wrong.

[Here's a link](http://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/2013-07-08/2013-college-football-watch-lists) to a list of all the watch lists for the post-season awards.

**Schedule Posters**
_____________________________________________

I've changed up the design a bit this year. I've included whether the game is home, away or at a neutral site. Also, each team has three posters - one with a photo, then two with just the logo and team colors for ones where photos didn't exactly work out. *cough* Akron *cough*

To download, find the poster you want, click on the three dots in a row on the bottom right, choose view all sizes, then find the size you want.

###[](/stonybrook) **STONY BROOK UNIVERSITY**    
*Colonial Athletic Association*  
[](/kiffin) **“More like *Brony* Brook, amirite? Football is Magic.”**
***
***
**Year Founded:** 1957    
**Location:** Stony Brook, New York  (a.k.a. Suburbia)  
**Total Attendance:** ~24,000
    
**Mascot:** The Seawolves    
**Live Mascot:** None, it's a mythical creature. Although there is an Atlantic fish that's called the seawolf and it would be certain level of badassery if they simply put a giant fish tank next to the field filled with [these fuckers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_wolffish).  The logo [shows a creature that's just not practical](http://i.imgur.com/dxxr9qa.png). What's it going to do? Whip me with it's scorpion tail made of water? I'm trying to imagine the meeting that determined that design: “Waves can be powerful, but make it a wolf too!” Meanwhile, on the sidelines they have a man in a [wolf suit that looks like it was picked up from the “Generic Wolf Aisle”](http://i.imgur.com/mobdJLf.jpg). Maybe they picked a cool name for him it would make—it's *“Wolfie”*? That's all you could come up with?   Laaaaaaaaaaaaame...Someone get them a fish suit.

**Cheerleaders:** [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/MXHyMvi.jpg)    
[](/kiffin) **“Have you guys seen [my wife](http://i.imgur.com/Hwr9Fy5.jpg)?  Yeah... *not* impressed.”**  

**Stadium:** Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium ([here it is during Homecoming 2012](http://i.imgur.com/tzzdJll.jpg)). The official capacity is 8,136, but a record crowd of 10,278 showed up to watch them play a [popular brand of toothpaste](http://www.colgate.com/app/Colgate/US/HomePage.cvsp) in 2012.
**Stadium Location:** On campus   
**Conference Champions** (5): Northeast Conference: 2005; Big South: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012    
**Number of Bowl Games:** Never.   
**National Titles** (0)
***
*Rivals*
***
Kind of a mishmash, observe:  
 
* [](/liberty) **Liberty**: really far away, was clearly a forced rivalry within the Big South—but now they're not even in the Big South anymore and aren't on the schedule this year. At least Liberty keeps Turner Gill employed—speaking of which, Liberty gave Stony Brook it's only conference loss in 2012.

* **Hofstra**: This one made sense because they're both on Long Island. Only problem is the rivalry ended in 2008 when Hofstra dropped football. I want to imagine it's because they were so savaged by the Seawolves that they signed some kind of formal surrender where they agreed to dismantle their football program and salt the field—but no: it's revenge by Dark Lord Baal for the school's insolence. They were the Flying Dutchmen until 2004, when the school went for “The Pride”, and I'm not talking about the potentially brave, cutting edge Pride that would give them fabulous costumes and the most outrageous, beat-thumping half time shows on earth. They went for a generic pair of lions. Seriously: Fuck Hofstra.  

* [](/albany) **Albany**: Scooby-Doo/Marmaduke over here appears to be their natural rival going into the future: both are SUNY schools, both are joining the CAA together this season, and Albany is the final game on the regular schedule. In 16 previous games, Albany holds the 11–5 edge.

*2012 Season*    
***  
**Record:** [10–3 (5–1 Big South)](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/_/id/2619/stony-brook-seawolves)

[**2012 Roster**](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/roster/_/id/2619/stony-brook-seawolves)    
**Key Players:** 

* Senior RB **Miguel Maysonet** was named Big South Offensive Player of the Year and an FCS All-American by the Associated Press. He was also the runner-up candidate for the Walter Payton Award, given to the most outstanding player in FCS. Some projected him to be the first Stony Brook player ever taken in the NFL Draft, however that wasn't meant to be and he signed a free-agent deal with Eagles.  
[](/kiffin) **“If you see Matty, tell him sorry again from me.”**  
[](/kelly) **“I'll be sure to let him know!”**  
[](/kiffin) **“GTFO of here!”**  
* In addition to Maysonet, 8 players made the all-conference list: Offense: WR Kevin Norrell, OL Michael Bamiro, OL Mike Lisi; Defense: DL Jonathan Coats, LB Jawara Dudley, DB Dominick Reyes, Special Teams: PK Wesley Skiffington

***
*The Greats*    
****
**Greatest Games:** 

* September 29, 2012, the Seawolves went to West Point and, in front of horrified fans, [ground Army into a fine paste before smoking them 23-3.](http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?id=322730349) This was Stony Brooks' only victory against an FBS foe in 5 attempts, but damn... Even Captain America shed a tear after that one.  The Middies... not so much. [](/troll)

[](/kiffin) **“Clearly these guys hate America.”**

* 2012 @Syracuse: Stony Brook jumped to a first half lead but eventually lost to the Orange in the Carrier Dome. The previous season they took UTEP to OT before losing. Clearly the Seawolves can hack it.

[](/kiffin) **“Oh c'mon—even *I* beat Syracuse last season!”**
  
**Greatest Plays:**

* Entering “Greatest plays in Stony Brook football history” into YouTube found [this doozy of a pass from the 2011 season that managed to make the ESPN Top-10 Plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlrmhdWpsME), therefore it probably qualifies.

**Greatest Players:**

* **Miguel Maysonet**: *See above*. 

* Things are thin after that. I googled the people in their Athletic HOF who played football, but the only hit I got—and I'm not making this up—was a LinkedIn profile for a guy who's the Regional Remarketing Manager at Enterprise Rent-A-Car. You know when the NCAA has those commercials where student-athletes tout the line ""most of us will go pro in something other than sports”? That's Stony Brook football. 

**Greatest Coaches:**

* **Chuck Priore**: The current coach started in 2006, inaugurating scholarship football at Stony Brook. He came by way of D3 Trinity (Conn.), where he led the Bantams for six seasons, winning conference titltes in his last four years (going a perfect 32-0 over the course of his final three). After three seasons hovering around .500 at Stony Brook, he started to see progress: the '09 and '10 squads both went 6-5 but were both 5-1 in conference and tied for the conference title. The '11 squad went 9-4, won the conference outright with a perfect 6-0, and lost in the second round of the FCS tourney with a ranking of No. 18. The 2012 squad went 10-3, 5-1 in conference (thanks to Turner Gill), tied for the conference title and again lost in the second round of the FCS tourney but with a rank of No. 10. Clearly this man is a candidate for a FBS program with a demonstrated track record of success. 

* **Sam Kornhauser**: From 1984 to 2005, he guided them from D3 Independent to the FCS level. He had an all-time record of 105–110 and modest-to-good results on the field. He stepped down in 2005 after winning his only conference title as coach of the Seawolves, going out on top. During his entire tenure, Stony Brook did not offer football scholarships. He is now Director of Athletics Advancement and Alumni Relations at the school.

* **Unknown**: Prior to 1984, Stony Brook [played years of club football](http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_iaa/bigsouth/suny_stony_brook/index.php) against other schools with club teams under the noble, legendary, enigmatic unknown coach.

*Traditions*
****
* I can't find any serious traditions. The main schools “athletic traditions” page just lists the school name, mascot and fight song. Those aren't serious traditions. The athletic website's “tradition” page on their site map just is a redirect to their mascot's website. Stony Brook has no tradition. They are without honor.

*Campus and Surrounding Area*
***
**City Population:** 13,740 (part of the extended suburbs of NYC)  
[**City Skyline**](http://i.imgur.com/tO2UlIB.jpg)   
**Iconic Campus Building:** 

* **[Charles B. Wang Center](http://i.imgur.com/XVFXPDF.jpg)**, a.k.a. **The Wang**, is the power and the glory of campus—it was erected in 2002 and remains a firm icon that endows campus with a turgid pride, throbbing with ideas that course through its veiny, extended student body. 

[](/kiffin) **“Penis.”**

* [**Stony Brook University Hospital**](http://i.imgur.com/O7nID8I.jpg) is also kind of cool in how it looks like hub of some kind of authoritarian/dystopian future government. 
  
**Local Dining:** 
After creeping some college forums it sounds like there aren't any particularly iconic spots next to campus, which isn't a total surprise considering the suburban location and fairly young age of the school.

* **Station Pizza &amp; Brew** is apparently the best of mediocre options. Pizza, beer, it delivers to dorms. 

* Since there's apparently a [Stony Brook Manhattan campus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Brook_Manhattan), let's open it up a bit and go with **[Per Se](http://www.perseny.com/)** offers American/French dining in the Time Warner Center in Manhattan. Opened by Thomas Keller (of French Laundry fame) in 2004 to what considered impossible-to-match-hype, this is what *The New York Times* [declared the best restaurant in NYC](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/dining/reviews/per-se-nyc-restaurant-review.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) and is echoed by Three Star reviews by Michelin, a top rating by Zagat, and placement in the top three restaurants in the world. Not really a traditional student budget, but NY and Long Island is full of trust fund children so the ~$300 prix-fixe shouldn't be too much of a problem (from my own experience with restaurants of this caliber, it's closer to $500 per person with drinks, tip, etc—budget accordingly). 

***
*Random Trivia*
***

* In terms of famous alumni, Stony Brook is a little thin: people you might have heard of include MLB pitcher Joe Nathan, actresses Joy Behar and Diane Farr, and reviled wacko Laura Schlessinger.

* Stony Brook helps manage and operate the [Brookhaven National Laboratories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookhaven_National_Laboratories), which does cutting-edge federal research on important topics like nuclear physics.

* Stony Brook scientists have invented such groundbreaking technologies as the virtual colonoscopy!

[](/kiffin) **“I think I'll pass on testing that VR helmet...”**

***
*What Is and What is to Come*
***
**Stony Brook fielded a football team in 2012 and, by all indications, intends to field another in 2013.** They had a good run the past two years, making it to the NCAA tournament second round, but their all-everything running back just graduated and has monstrous shoes to fill as they head into their first season in the Colonial Athletic Conference. Still, there are several all-conference players returning and a talented coach who has yet to be stolen by a bigger program, so anything is possible.

See how to do your part, or maybe even become a mod, inside.",sirgippy,756,137,186,http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/130kfx/mod_announcement_we_need_your_help_to_keep_rcfb/,"**Please upvote this post, for which I receive no karma, so that others will see this announcement.**

First off, whether you've been here for a few seasons now or you're totally new to reddit and/or /r/CFB, thanks for coming and making this place awesome.

With the season in full swing we've been growing in size each and every week; for the last seven weeks we've been averaging over 1,000 new subscribers per week. We have double the number of users now as compared to this summer and we are getting more than triple the number of pageviews this season than we did last season.

Inevitably with the growth in size has come the need to make a few adjustments in terms of how we moderate content. Our goal is not to censor any particular messages or fanbases, but rather to maintain a civil environment where users can share whatever type of content they want: from silly images, to serious analysis, to breaking news, to trash talk, etc. In order to facilitate all of this, we've begun trying to filter quick content which has a tendency to overwhelm ours and other subreddits into weekly threads, as you may have noticed. The goal of the threads is to give everything a place so that we can cater to everyone including those who want to discuss the ins and outs of college football as well as those who just want to have a quick laugh.

We've also noticed somewhat of a pick-up lately in terms of fighting between fanbases and conferences and just in general users taking things too far. We as mods try to handle situations when we see them, but unfortunately there's just too much content here for us to see everything.

We still think we can do better.

**So, as promised, here's what you guys can do to help us out**:

* First off, **make sure to read [the recently expanded and updated /r/CFB FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/cfb)**. It should answer most questions you have in terms of what happens on what day and what rules we're trying to establish.  
* **Post content which better belongs in a thread in that thread.** Memes go in the meme thread. If you have a highlight image or video on gameday, or a request for someone to supply one, put it in the image/video/request thread.
* **Make sure to check the /new/ page and search before posting something, especially on gameday.** If there's some big news story and you didn't catch it in minutes, odds are it's already been posted.
* **Be civil.** One of the big reasons why we're able to have conversations here is thanks to keeping the out-and-out name-calling and personal attacks down to a minimum. Just because someone sports your rival's flair doesn't mean they can't be rational in their discussions.
* **Vote based on quality and not agreement.** Don't vote on a post just because of the flair or because you agree/disagree with an argument. Even if you disagree with what someone has said, if they presented it in a well-reasoned or insightful way, upvote it and respond to continue the conversation.
* **Report posts which are more appropriate in a weekly thread.** If something has been reported we can usually respond to it much faster.  
* **Report posts and comments which break our rules, especially any racism, homophobia, flamebait, or personal information.** We can't be everywhere, but if it gets reported one of us will look at it. If you believe you're being unwarrantably attacked by another user, don't attack back, just report it and we'll take care of it.

Finally, in order to help us keep things clean, **we're recruiting 2-3 more mods**. We're primarily looking for new mods to help us monitor new posts and handle the moderation queue, especially on the weekend when we have the most traffic and posts. Our ideal candidate has time to help during gameday, is a long time user, and has experience moderating before, though anyone who thinks they'd be a good fit is encouraged to apply.

To apply, please [fill out this application](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dG5WWGxRdXBpMWRjdjVtdXI0djZaUnc6MQ). We'll be accepting applications for several days in order to give anyone who wants to the opportunity to apply before picking a few out at the end of the week or early next week.

*Big Ten Conference*

***

**Year Founded:** 1817

**Location:** Ann Arbor, Michigan

**Total Attendance:** 43,426 (27,979 Undergrad, 15,447 postgrad)

**Nickname:** Wolverines

Although wolverines have never been native to Michigan, the state has been known as the “Wolverine State” since at least the 1830s. The true origin of the nickname is unknown, but three primary theories exist--first, that the name resulted from the large amount of fur trading that took place in Michigan’s early days, second, that the name was invented by Native Americans comparing the rate at which settlers grabbed land to the notoriously gluttonous wolverine, or third, that the name was originally an insult hurled at Michiganders by Ohioans during the Toledo War of 1835-1836 (this is the most commonly accepted explanation). In any case, students of the University of Michigan have been known as Wolverines since at least 1861.

**Live Mascot:** None. No guy in a costume, and no live wolverine.

In 1927, Athletic Director Fielding H. Yost decided that he liked the idea of borrowing live wolverines from the Detroit Zoo and [having them paraded around the field in cages on gameday.](http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/umosu/images/bennbiff.jpg)  Unsurprisingly, the wolverines were not happy with this arrangement and the tradition was canceled after only one season because, as Yost noted, “*it was obvious that the Michigan mascots had designs on the Michigan men toting them, and those designs were by no means friendly.*""

**Band:** [The Michigan Marching Band](http://i.imgur.com/XHX6u.jpg)

The MMB was founded in 1896 and began playing at football games in 1898. William D. Revelli, a name synonymous with the program, served as the band’s director from 1935 to 1971 and the Marching Band Hall was named in his honor. In the 2013 season, the band will feature 340 members who must go through the band week tradition of learning/relearning marching fundamentals as well as the large amount of music that the band plays every year known as “traditionals”.

The band does all rehearsals on Elbel field, a short walk from the Big House, and named after Louis Elbel, author of *The Victors*. During the season only 235 members make it into the performance block for pregame each week via a “challenge” system. Those who don’t make it in will still rehearse, march to the stadium, attend the game and play in the stands, but they wait in the stands while the rest of the band performs pregame and halftime.

The band performs at all home games and travels to away games in South Bend, East Lansing, and Columbus for rivalry games. [During a visit to Columbus in 1932, the MMB is credited with inventing Ohio State’s most famous tradition, the “Script Ohio.”](http://imgur.com/KDmGWbU)

The MMB was the first collegiate marching band to receive the Sudler Trophy, an award given annually to honor the best marching band in college athletics that cannot be awarded to the same band twice. In addition to their halftime shows the band is known for their high-tempo pregame entrance, which traditionally includes the band’s lone Drum Major [doing a back bend without his or her hat on.](http://imgur.com/H0BLFWS) Finally, unlike most of the college football landscape at the moment, the vast majority of music played at Michigan Stadium is band-provided and “piped-in” music was only added in the last few years.

[Here’s a pretty great video of the MMB’s entire pregame routine during the 2011 “Under the Lights” game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QfGEAKHbM)

**Fight Song:** [*The Victors*.](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrnkOkraJXK4)

The most recognizable fight song in sports, declared the “*greatest college fight song ever written*” by none less than John Philip Sousa himself, *The Victors* (and **not** Hail to the Victors) was written in 1898 following a last-minute victory over rival Chicago that won Michigan the Western Conference Championship (hence “Champions of the West”).

The song, which we proudly recognize as the only college fight song which already assumes that we’ve won the game, has plenty of lyrics outside of the chorus that everybody knows--[check them out.](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FHSXnzFDXaFQ%3Ft%3D1m30s)

[As you might expect](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_oEstbblEyU), we’re [crazy](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DuGNnd4JIUZo) about *The Victors*. Before Michigan football freshmen ever play a game, [they are taught the correct way to sing it by a faculty member of the School of Music](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsports.espn.go.com%2Fncf%2Fcolumns%2Fstory%3Fcolumnist%3Dmaisel_ivan%26id%3D2155513&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuXSz-251TzAt9OFLkwffyJldH8Q)--fist pumping, inflection, and everything. UM Alumnus President Gerald Ford would request that *The Victors* be played at his events instead of the customary *Hail to the Chief*, and he stipulated that it be played at his funeral.

**Other Songs:** [*Varsity*](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHSXnzFDXaFQ) (Michigan’s fight song while we were an independent in the 1900s and 1910s, given that we couldn’t call ourselves “Champions of the West” any more) The [*Yellow and Blue*](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtcQGxh3g5d8) (our alma mater), [*Temptation and the Hawaiian War Chant*](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DF_BpCInnIV8) (played at every game since the 1950s, *Temptation* is played when the defense forces a turnover or punt. Outside of that context, *the Hawaiian War Chant* almost universally follows the playing of *Temptation* with the announcer and crowd declaring “You can’t have one without the other!”). Also of note is *I Can’t Turn You Loose* (the Blues Brothers song), [which is played to pump up the student section](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVEMQri6uuAE) entering the fourth quarter of football games, the third period of hockey games, and the final stretch of basketball games.

**Stadium:** [Michigan Stadium](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Michigan_Stadium_2011.jpg/800px-Michigan_Stadium_2011.jpg) ([est. 1927](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Michigan_Stadium_opening_3c27311.png))

“The Big House” has an official capacity of 109,901, making it the largest stadium in the United States and the third-largest stadium in the world. Since 1975, every game has been attended by at least 100,000 spectators--a streak of over 200 games.

Opened with an initial capacity of just 82,000, Athletic Director Fielding H. Yost had the foresight to ensure that the stadium’s foundations had the ability to support much larger crowds, paving the way for expansions that continue to this day. Because Michigan Stadium is built into the ground, [it has a relatively low profile](http://www.public-art.umich.edu/the_collection/images/full/216)--deceiving people into underestimating its size from the outside. According to legend, during the stadium’s construction a construction crane sank into the sand beneath the field, where it remains to this day.

Since 1955, the official capacity of Michigan Stadium has always ended with a “1” to note that an extra seat is perpetually reserved for former athletic director and football coach Fritz Crisler.

Michigan Stadium has also hosted outdoor hockey games including [The Big Chill at the Big House](http://multimedia.detnews.com/pix/c5/6d/17/84/51/b9/20101211200052_2010-1211-dg-bigchill0929.jpg) (Michigan beat MSU 5-0), and it will be the site of the 2014 NHL Winter Classic between the Detroit Red Wings and the Toronto Maple Leafs.

**Stadium Location:** [University of Michigan South Campus](http://www.thepapergallery.net/-Morgan/75080.jpg), walking distance from Central Campus. Conveniently located in-between the Michigan Golf Course (where adults tailgate) and most of the undergrad student neighborhoods (where students tailgate).

**All-Time Record:** 903-315-36 (.734)

**Conference Championships:** 42

**Number of Bowl Games:** 42, including a streak of 33 consecutive; 20-22 (8-12 in the Rose Bowl, 11-14 in the Big Four Bowls, 2-3 in BCS Bowls)

**National Titles (11 Claimed):** 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1918, 1923, 1932, 1933, 1947, 1948, 1997

*Rivals (in chronological order)*

***

[](/notredame) **Notre Dame Fighting Irish (Michigan leads, 23-16-1)** [](/notredame)
 
“*To Hell with Notre Dame!*” -Bo

Michigan’s football relationship with Notre Dame began in 1887 when Michigan’s team made their way down to South Bend to literally teach Notre Dame how to play football. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. Although Michigan and Notre Dame initially started on good terms, the relationship between the two teams had soured by 1910 when the notoriously anti-Catholic Fielding H. Yost began feuding with Notre Dame’s Knute Rockne. Notre Dame was at the time desperate to join the Western Conference/Big Ten, but Yost led the Big Ten in not only preventing Notre Dame from joining the conference, but blackballing them from their schedules as well. Struggling to find games in the midwest, Notre Dame turned to scheduling games on the [East Coast](http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/slides/photos/000/899/957/NavyNotreDame_display_image.jpg?1304047976) and [West Coast](http://www.fillio.com/blog/nd/files/bush_push.jpg) instead.

In 1947, the rivalry resurfaced when both schools finished the regular season 9-0, with Notre Dame being voted AP National Champion. After Michigan demolished USC 49-0 in the 1948 Rose Bowl, however, a special AP re-vote was convened with Michigan being declared the champion. To this day, both schools claim the 1947 championship.

By the time the series started back up in 1978, both team were established as two of the most storied programs in all of college football. Many of the games in the modern era have been great contests with national implications, and the hate between the two is as strong as ever. Unfortunately, in 2012 Notre Dame exercised an opt-out clause in the scheduling contract and the rivalry is being paused indefinitely after 2014.

Some great moments: [Desmond Howard's diving 4th down catch in 1991](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DfJA3sJawFaY) and the entire [“Under the Lights”](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVBmCew7PbyQ) game in 2011.

[](/chicago) **University of Chicago Maroons (Michigan leads, 19-7)** [](/chicago)

Long before Ohio State joined the Western Conference/Big Ten, national powerhouse Chicago was Michigan’s fiercest rival. Michigan beat Chicago for the Western Conference Championship in 1898, inspiring then-student Louis Elbel to write The Victors on the train ride home. Led by Fielding H. Yost and Chicago’s legendary Amos Alonzo Stagg, the heated rivalry boiled over at many points on and off the field. In 1905, Chicago dealt Yost his first loss as Michigan’s coach when Michigan player Denny Clark was tackled for a safety, the only score of the game. The mistake would go on to haunt Clark for the rest of his life until he unfortunately committed suicide some years later.

Humiliated by the loss and fearing that Stagg would use his superior position to institute rules to Michigan’s detriment, Yost and Michigan instantly packed up and left the Western Conference, becoming an independent in 1906. Needing opponents to schedule outside of the Western Conference, Michigan turned to regularly scheduling fellow independents Michigan Agricultural College (later MSU) and Ohio State University, effectively beginning our rivalries with both. 

The teams last met in 1939, where Michigan closed out the rivalry with an 85-0 victory over the Maroons. Chicago left the Big Ten Conference in 1946, and they were replaced by Michigan State.

[](/minnesota) **Minnesota Golden Gophers (Michigan leads, 72-24-3)** [](/minnesota)

In 1903, Fielding H. Yost’s unbeaten powerhouse Michigan team travelled to Minneapolis to face off against Minnesota, who at the time had a very successful team of their own. Fearing that Minnesota would provide tainted water to the visitors, Yost sent for an assistant to buy a water jug from a nearby store for his team to use. Michigan led 6-0 for most of the game in front of a raucous crowd until Minnesota finally scored to tie the game with two minutes left, causing the crowd to storm the field and the game to be called early as a 6-6 tie. In the ensuing pandemonium, Michigan left the field and the jug was left behind, where it was claimed by Minnesota’s athletic department. From there Michigan and Minnesota mutually decided that the jug would be a suitable trophy for future rivalry games, making the [Little Brown Jug](http://www.annarbor.com/assets_c/2011/09/BROWN-JUG-thumb-590x414-89350.jpg) one of the oldest rivalry trophies in American college football.

Initially the rivalry was pretty fierce. The contests between Michigan and Minnesota in the 1930s were especially important since both teams had national title hopes almost every year, but with Minnesota’s program being in a tailspin since the 1960s Michigan has dominated the series. Currently this isn’t much of a rivalry so the on-campus hype is minimal, but on the rare occasions when Minnesota wins it is very painful for us.

[](/ohiostate) **Ohio State Buckeyes (Michigan leads, 58-45-6)** [](/ohiostate)

“*If you granted me just one more week as Michigan’s head coach, I wouldn’t hesitate. I know exactly what I’d want...I wouldn’t ask to coach another game. No. Give me one more week of coaching in preparation for the Ohio State game. And make it against the great Wayne Woodrow Hayes. Just give me a week--from our film session on Sunday to my pre-game speech on Saturday--to get our guys ready for that game against that old general on the other side of the field. That would be it.*” -Bo, a few months before his death in 2006

Michigan hates Ohio and Ohio hates Michigan. It’s not just a football thing, and it’s not just a UM-OSU thing. When Eastern Michigan plays Kent State in front of a few thousand people, it means more because it’s Michigan versus Ohio. When you go on roadtrips, it’s not unheard of to drive hours out of your way to take a longer route so that your car doesn’t enter Ohio. At the very least, you’d better stop for gas at the last exit in Michigan.

In late November, on the last Saturday of Big Ten football season, all of that hatred reaches a boiling point. Michigan versus Ohio State--simply referred to as “The Game”--is widely recognized as the greatest rivalry in American sports due not only to the intensity of the rivalry, but its importance on the college football landscape as well.  

The first time that these two schools played each other was in 1897 and the matchup has occurred 106 times. Prior to the addition of the Big Ten Championship game, The Game decided the Big Ten Championship between the two schools 22 times, and The Game has affected the outcome of the Big Ten Championship on an additional  27 separate occasions. The Game has [created legends](http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/slides/photos/000/245/134/52958999_display_image.jpg?1275500031) and [ruined careers](http://www.thebuckeyebattlecry.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/John-Cooper.jpg) and a player on either team’s legacy is ultimately judged by how he performed against his rival. 

The rivalry truly exploded during the “Ten Year War” between Bo and Woody starting in 1969, and has seen several momentum changes since then. Gary Moeller and Lloyd Carr saw great success in the 1990s, only for Jim Tressel to wrestle back control of the rivalry in the 2000s. With Brady Hoke at the helm for Michigan, there is plenty of hope in Ann Arbor that the rivalry can be ours once again.

Some great moments: [1969](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DvBKhgAiADLI%23t%3D5m54s) (more on that later), [Tshimanga Biakabutuka](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJebemqUKRwA) rushes for 313 yards to defeat the previously-undefeated Buckeyes in 1995, [Desmond Howard &amp; Charles Woodson punt returns](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNQy2ohW9OaI), and [ending the streak.](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DTB7NXdYDtBs)

[](/michiganstate) **Michigan State Spartans (Michigan leads, 68-32-5)** [](/michiganstate)

Michigan State has always had it out for Michigan, in part because Ann Arbor saw the Big Ten adding Sparty in 1950 as the conference lowing its standards. Michigan regards State as a rival, but our disdain for them doesn’t even come close to the absolute hatred coming to Ann Arbor from East Lansing every year. Even the “Spartan” nickname comes from their hatred of Ann Arbor, which was commonly regarded as the “Athens of the West” a few decades ago. When MSU and Michigan both played in Auburn Hills for this year’s NCAA Basketball Tournament, Michigan’s opponent South Dakota State saw their merchandise sales [quadruple](http://www.gooFgle.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbssports.com%2Fcollegebasketball%2Fblog%2Feye-on-college-basketball%2F21917977%2Fmsu-fans-buying-south-dakota-state-gear-to-wear-during-michigan-game&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfIo4Hn7O0iThmrFNsnMEch27AZQ) in part due to Michigan State fans buying SDSU stuff to cheer against us. 

The first game between the two schools took place in 1898 and they have played each other every year since 1910 (with a brief hiatus in the 1943 and 1944 seasons). The [Paul Bunyan Trophy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/PaulBunyanTrophy.jpg/250px-PaulBunyanTrophy.jpg) was introduced in 1953, MSU’s first season as a full Big Ten Member. The series stands at 35-23-2 in Michigan's favor since the trophy's inception. 

Historically Michigan has dominated State in just about every sport, holding a 68-32-5 lead in football, a 95-76 lead in basketball, and a 145-125-19 lead in hockey, but in recent years quality MSU coaches like Tom Izzo and Mark Dantonio have evened out the rivalry significantly.

Some great moments: [Charles Woodson’s ridiculous 1997 interception](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdtFVMO8e9Fc), [Braylonfest](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJa1QAi3ZL8s%23t%3D1m06s), [Mike Hart’s “little brother” press conference.](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6455_8FsJOM)

*The Greats*

***

**Greatest Games:**

* **[1902 Rose Bowl](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/1st-Rose-Bowl-game-1902.jpg) (Michigan 49, Stanford 0)**—The first bowl game in the history of college football ended in the third quarter when Stanford surrendered to Fielding H. Yost’s “point-a-minute” squad. Fearful of future blowouts, the Rose Bowl refused to host another football game for 13 years. The 1901 Michigan team outscored their opponents 550-0 en route to the program’s first national championship.
* **1934 Michigan v. Georgia Tech (Michigan 9, Georgia Tech 2)**—Michigan won national championships in 1932 and 1933 largely due to the great play by Willis Ward, their only African-American player. In 1934 Georgia Tech refused to play Michigan if Ward took the field. Ann Arbor went into an uproar with student protests. Legendary playwright Arthur Miller, a Michigan student at the time, was heavily involved and wrote an article in the school newspaper regarding the affair, including the death threats made to Ward by some of the Georgia Tech players. Gerald Ford, the team’s star center and Ward’s [close friend and roommate](http://media.mlive.com/wolverines_impact/photo/9324364-large.jpg), told his coach that if Ward didn’t play, he wouldn’t play. On game day, Ward told Ford to play without him, and Gerry Ford led Michigan to a 9-2 win in a heated contest in front of an angry Michigan Stadium crowd.
* **1945 Michigan v. Army at Yankee Stadium (Army 28, Michigan 7)**--Overmatched against wartime Army, which was a powerhouse, head coach Fritz Crisler invented a stunning new tactic to try and even the odds: the platoon system. A stunned TIME Magazine would write, “*Michigan plays one team on offense, one on defense...he gives his “offense unit” one kind of indoctrination, his “defense unit” the other. Crisler even has a “point-after-touchdown” unit--including a specialist place-kicker and seven of the biggest linemen on the squad.*” Although Michigan would go on to lose the game, it would mark the invention of the platoon system that is used today in every level of football.
* **1948 Rose Bowl (Michigan 49, USC 0)**—In their first Rose Bowl appearance since defeating Stanford 49-0 in 1902, Michigan crushed USC 49-0. As previously mentioned, Michigan’s spectacular performance against USC led to a special AP poll being held after the game in which voters awarded Michigan the national championship over Notre Dame. 
* **[1950 Snow Bowl](http://maizeandgoblue.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/UM-OSU-1950-Snow-bowl.jpg) (Michigan 9, Ohio State 3)**—As is typical for a Michigan-Ohio State contest, this game would decide the Big Ten Championship. There was a nasty blizzard in Columbus on this day, and they almost canceled the game. The teams combined for 45 punts (often on first down), and Michigan won the game even though they had no first downs. They blocked a punt near the end zone for their only touchdown in this bizarre affair.
* **[The 1969 Game](http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/umosu/images/69celebl.jpg) (Bo 24, Woody 12)**—In 1968, Woody Hayes’s Ohio State team crushed Michigan by a score of 50-14, with Hayes purposely running up the score late in the game by going for two points “because I couldn’t go for three.”  The next season, the 1969 Ohio State Buckeyes were being hyped as the greatest college team of all time, with at least one publication saying that the only game worth watching all year would be OSU’s offense facing off against its defense in practice. With newly-hired head coach and former Hayes assistant Bo Schembechler at the helm, Michigan would pull off the upset to spoil Ohio State’s undefeated season and kick off ten years of Bo-vs-Woody rivalry matches that we refer to as “The Ten Year War.” At the time, this was considered one of the greatest upsets in the history of college football.
* [**The 1995, 1996, and 1997 Games**](http://worldonline.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/blogs/entry_img/2009/Aug/30/1201_large.jpg)—In 1995, undefeated Ohio State visited Ann Arbor looking to keep their national championship hopes alive. Tim Biakabutuka was going to have none of that. He ran for 313 yards and led Michigan to a 31-23 win. In 1996 Ohio State was again undefeated, and Michigan beat them 13-9 in Columbus to ruin another perfect season. In 1997, the tables were turned, and Michigan was the undefeated team. Charles Woodson had a key interception in the endzone and returned a punt for a touchdown to keep Michigan’s national championship hopes alive with a 20-14 victory. Michigan would go on to win the Rose Bowl over Washington State to win its first national championship in nearly 50 years.
* **[2011 “Under the Lights”](http://www.michiganreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Michigan-stadium-night-game-52.jpg) (Michigan 35, Notre Dame 31)**--Michigan pulled out all of the stops for the first night game in the history of Michigan Stadium. During the pregame show, Desmond Howard was named Michigan’s first “Legend” and the atmosphere was especially electric. Notre Dame dominated the first three quarters, heading into the fourth with a 24-7 lead. Led by Irish-slayer Denard Robinson, Michigan scored three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, only to see themselves down 31-28 with 8 seconds left to play. With noted Buckeye Kirk Herbstreit pleading for Brady Hoke to center the ball and kick a safe game-tying field goal, Michigan instead chose to go for it, scoring a game-winning touchdown with just two seconds remaining.  

**Greatest Plays:**

* It may not be a single play, but during Tom Harmon’s senior season in 1940 he led Michigan to a 40-0 win in Ohio Stadium, scoring three rushing touchdowns, two passing touchdowns, kicking four extra points, intercepting three passes, and punting three times for an average of 50 yards. At the end of the game, the Ohio State home crowd gave him a standing ovation.

I understand the nature of this business and the expectations at Auburn better than most. For this reason, I am aware that this past season was unacceptable. With that being said, before you dance on the grave of Chizik's tenure at Auburn, I would like to point out a couple of things.
The National Championship speaks for itself, as should the ""overachieving"" seasons he had in 2009 and 20011. Still, I would like to bring to light a few things that many people may not be aware of.
The previous coaching staff, for several different reasons, had left behind a group of young men that were damaged, discouraged and bitter towards Auburn. I was ready to leave auburn, as were several teammates (teammates that would be integral to the 2010 National Championship run).
All of that changed the day Coach Chizik and his staff stepped on campus. We became students before athle
tes, people before scholarships, sons before players, and a family before a football team. He ""fixed"" the hearts and heads of young men that will go forward to be some of the greatest advocates and ambassadors Auburn has ever known. This, along with a national title and conference championship, will be his lasting legacy at Auburn.
I stood with Coach Chizik though grueling workouts and hellacious practices, through joyous victories and agonizing defeats, through trying times and sweet redemption. I also stood with Coach Chizik at a children’s hospital in Tampa, Florida, after he and I and a handful of my teammates had the privilege of visiting with the patients for a few hours. He looked at me and said ""You know, Andrew, you can’t ever forget what’s most important in life.” He hasn’t forgotten. Neither have I. Thank you Coach. Thank you for everything.",,False,self,t5_2qm9d,False,,auburn,True,t3_13tj75,http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/13tj75/former_auburn_ol_andrew_mccain_posted_this/,

Despite being the birthplace of college football, Rutgers was considered one of the WORST FBS teams in the late 90's. We didn't even invest in it until December 2000 when hiring Greg Schiano. Greg Schiano is credited in one of the biggest turn arounds in college football history. Budgetary wise, one would clearly see how much more money Rutgers was spending regarding ""higher level athletics"" to boost its profile, and to try and mimic a Michigan or Cal of the east (balancing athletics &amp; academics). Our success first came in 2006 after that memorable Louisville win, that's when people said our investment 'paid off'. Ever since then we've been upgrading facilities for all sports, this why I think of us as a young program still. It seems that every year we're keeping more and more in state recruits since Schiano came to town. If we could keep it up, we can be a powerhouse just because we have enough in state talent to fill up our roster.

Breaking down Schiano's [record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Schiano#Head_coaching_record), we can see just how much things have changed

Pre-Schiano records: Dick Anderson 1984–1989 27–34–4 (.446), Doug Graber 1990–1995 29–36–1 (.447), Terry Shea 1996–2000 11–44 (.200)

2001-2005 record: 19-39 (.328)

2006-2011 record: 49-28 (.636)

Post Schiano era, Kyle Flood in 2012: 9-4 (.692)

(BTW our 2010 season was bad because that's when Eric LeGrand got paralyzed :/ and the morale of everyone on the team was down.)
Greg Schiano was able to so all this with the Big East brand and Big 
East dollars...hopefully we can capitalize on the groundwork he laid down with Rutgers.

On the night of April 25, 1875, a group of nine sophomores from Rutgers set off to Princeton to take back a cannon they thought was rightfully theirs. Student tradition has it that at one time the cannon was the property of Rutgers College, but Princeton had stolen it and placed it on their own campus. The Orangemen constantly taunted Rutgers with the cannon. Finally in 1875, Rutgersmen went to 
Princeton and returned at dawn with the cannon.

The story of the ""Cannon War spread throughout the nation's newspapers, Princeton responded by stealing a few muskets from the Rutgers Armory. To settle the dispute, the presidents of the two colleges set up a joint committee which eventually recommended that the cannon be returned.

Today the cannon is behind Nassau Hall on the Princeton campus. The cannon that stands in front of Old Queens was placed there by the Class of 1877 as a memorial of the event. To this day, spirited Rutgers students engage in midnight trips to paint Princeton's cannon with their scarlet pride.

*Random Trivia*
***

* Rutgers &amp; Princeton had originally scheduled to meet three times in 1869, but the third 1869 game never took place, reportedly because of the officials at both programs who complained about more emphasis being put on the contests rather than academics and studying. Other sources claim that it may have been canceled due to disagreement over what set of rules to play under. Due to each team winning one game, the inaugural football ""season"" ended with Princeton and Rutgers each tied at 1-1, and therefore each received a partial share of the college football national championship awarded (retroactively) for the 1869 season.

***
*Brief History*
***
* On May 2,1866 in the first intercollegiate athletic event in Rutgers history, the Rutgers baseball team falls to the Princeton team, 40-2.

* In 1913 Foster Sanford, Rutgers' first ""real"" football coach and a member of the National Football Hall of Fame, takes the Rutgers team in hand. He was famed for his innovations, including the ""hurdle play,"" in which a lightweight member of the track team, suited up in pants with leather loops, carried the ball while being hurled over the line by two halfbacks.

* 1919 Paul Robeson, the only black in his class and the third in Rutgers' history, gives the valedictorian address at commencement. Hailed as perhaps the greatest college football player of his time, he had been hazed so unmercifully his freshman year that he lost several fingernails because his own teammates purposely stomped his hands during pileups.

* In 1932 The College Avenue Gymnasium is built on the site of the first intercollegiate football game.

* In 1938, Rutgers Stadium is dedicated.

* Sept. 27 1969, Rutgers defeats Princeton, 29-0, in the Centennial football game.

* In 1976 It was a banner year for Rutgers Athletics with both football and men's basketball teams going undefeated and the basketball team reaching the NCAA Final Four.

* In 1978 the football team earns its first-ever bowl invitation, playing Arizona State in the Garden State Bowl.

* 1987 - The [Hale Center football complex](http://www.scarletknights.com/facilities/tour/hale-10.html) is completed.

* In 1991, Rutgers defeats Boston College in the first-ever BIG EAST football game.

* 1994 - Rutgers Stadium is renovated/expanded to hold 42,000

* 2005 - Steal Ray Rice from Syracuse after their coach leaves

* 2005 - Head Football Coach Greg Schiano guides Rutgers to its best record in over a decade, 7-5, and its first bowl bid since 1978. In a Wild West shootout staged at Phoenix’s Chase Field, Rutgers fell just short, losing to Arizona State (7-5), 45-40, at the Insight Bowl Dec. 27.

* November 9, 2006 - ""Pandemonium in Piscataway"" Rutgers Football Upsets No. 2 Louisville; finishes the season ranked 12th-nationally with a 11-2 record. Greg Schiano named National Coach of the Year
2009 - Rutgers Stadium expansion project adds 11, 000 seats and closes-in South end zone.

*What Is and What is to Come*

2012 will go down as the year that could have been. It started off so well, but left such a bitter taste in fans’ mouths. The team blew not one, but two straight chances to win the Big East with the latter being a head to head match up for the crown at home against a gimpy Teddy Bridgewater. The bowl game, although the best the team has ever made, was seen, rightfully, as a disappointing way to cap off a frustrating season for a team that looked as if it was finally going to take the proverbial next step and ascend onto the national playing field. The bowl was an accurate summation of the team’s season: gritty, aggressive defense and an offense that was so bad that stagnant would be an overstatement. The first play of the game the defense scored a touchdown, and for the next 59 minutes the offense only managed 3 points. As overtime came, the loss was predictable.

Looking ahead to 2013, the team will have a new identity. The 2012 recruiting class, a unanimous top 25 class, will begin to make its mark. Defensive leaders and likely first round picks Logan Ryan (CB) and Khaseem Greene (played a unique LB position known as the “R”) are gone, but have capable replacements in the wings. Look for Steve Longa to take over and put up gaudy numbers at the R and Tejay Johnson to step in at CB. The problem with all this change is that the team was carried by the defense last year. They will not, at least initially, have a similar luxury in 2013.

That brings us to the offense. The success of the offense is completely dependent upon the play of the QB. Gary Nova is likely to retain his role as starter, but look for RS Freshman Blake Rankin to make it a fight after receiving high praise over the past year. The offense is loaded at skill positions talent wise (RB Savon Huggins was a 5* recruit, WR Brandon Coleman is being projected as a top-10 pick, the other likely starting WRs, Miles Shuler, Leonte Caroo, and Ruhann Peele, were all 4* recruits as well) so a even semi-capable QB should vault this offense into a top 30 unit nationally. For this team to succeed, decent QB play is absolutely essential. 

Predictions below, based on conditions stated. **Big East game schedule has not been released, so I placed the home games first followed by road games.**

Same Gary Nova as last year, young and weaker defense (7-5) Gary Nova doesn’t improve, we likely see a late year QB switch, and the defense is good but not good enough to carry the team like it did last year. Likelihood: 40%

@ Fresno State L 35-10

Decent QB, Great Defense (9-3) We see a nearly identical year to 2012. Nova performs just well enough to not get benched but also poor enough to keep the team off the board a bit too frequently. Likelihood: 40%

Great QB Play, no drop off in defense (12-0) This scenario has greatly improved QB play under new OC Ron Prince that utilizes the explosive playmakers on the team. The defense doesn't miss a step as the highly touted youngsters step in smoothly. Likelihood: 20%

@ Fresno State W 28-3

Rutgers fans were left with a very disappointing season in 2012. It's not very often that you hear a fan base calling for the head of a first year of a head coach after going 9-3 in the regular season. Preseason predictions with Greg Schiano had us going 11-1 with a loss to Arkansas (lol) because of all the talent that was returning on defense. After Kyle Flood was promoted to head coach, many were skeptical he could lead us to the title having no prior head coaching experience and backloading all of our staff with coordinators from FCS schools. Even with our abysmal offense, the critics couldn't say much when we were 7-0, but quickly came out of the woodwork after losing to Kent State. The second half of the year was a disaster, losing two games in a row 
which would have sent us to the BCS. Looking forward to the future, there is plenty of reason to be excited. The move to the Big Ten should allow us some more quality players to stay home and our large alumni base will be re-energized to play top schools in the mid west.

2013 is the most important year in the program’s history due to the upcoming move to the B1G. First, the team needs to reestablish its identity on defense without coordinator Robb Smith and defensive starters and leaders Khaseem Greene, Duron Harmon, Logan Ryan, Scott Vallone, Brandon Jones, and Steve Beauharnis. The team must be ready to compete defensively and build momentum for the 2014 season.

On another front, 2013 is absolutely huge in recruiting. This will be the first class that has mainly built relationships with Coach Flood rather than the Schiano staff. 2013 is also a deep class in NJ in my opinion. Rutgers is trying to capitalize on this while expanding their recruiting footprint to B1G country (they have offered QBs from Texas, Michigan, Maryland, and Ohio already). I recommend you read Todd Hunt’s articles (www.nj.com/rutgersfootball) if you would like to follow the process, he does a great job.

Since we were up first, we don't quite know what else to discuss. Feel free to ask any questions you would like to know answers to in the comments.

After two awful experiences with SEC fans(UF- Mich Cap One Bowl and MSU - Mich Gator Bowl) I went into this matchup with trepidation about Gamecock fans behavior; I couldn't have been more wrong. 

The tailgate was a mixed bag of SC and Mich fans in the parking lot,and there was some jawing, but it was all respectful. We, as Mich fans, were offered food and drink from many SC fans; that didn't happen at the prior two bowl games I mentioned.

During the game, the SC fans were loud and organized. I sat on the Mich side, 5 yd line of the SC endzone. When SC needed noise, the fans delivered; it was a wall of sound emanating from their endzone. The S-E-C chant after that first pick was a little annoying, though.

After the game, many SC fans congratulated us on a hard fought game. No one taunted, yelled, or threw liquor bottles at us(looking at you, Gator fans). We hung out in the parking lot waiting for the traffic to die down with a few Gamecock fans. I brought way too much food for the pre-game and handed it out liberally. The people were genuinely thankful and polite. 

The interaction with the SC fans made this gut-wrenching loss a little more tolerable. Thank you.

**TL;DR** Gamecock fans are a class act.

**EDIT** I forgot to mention the lovely ladies in sundresses and cowboy boots. Yowza.

**EDIT 2** I didn't mean for this to be an SEC bashing thread - I merely wanted to compliment the SC fans. The experiences I related were merely for context. **FULL DISCLOSURE** I will probably be attending UF in the fall.

It reminded me of the sites that have write ups on one college team a day in the lead up to the season. I was thinking perhaps our subreddit could do something similar but with a little twist. Every week we could have a few threads in which a fan/fans knowledgeable about their team could give us kind of a 'get to know you' on their respective school. We could use it to learn about other school's most famous players, traditions, rivalries, stadium, history, legendary plays/games, etc. We could basically create a template with categories that people would fill out. This could include non-D1 schools as well because I know several of them frequent this subreddit. Anyway, just an idea and I figured I would put it up for discussion.


 
**edit** Someone decided to fill the Google Doc Spreadsheet with racial slurs and delete several things so I temporarily closed it while I got things figured out. I restored it to a previous version that should have everyone's names still. I don't know when the vandalism started though so I did my best guess. For now, you can only view the page. If you would like to write one for your team, contribute to a group, or add your school to the list, please message me directly and I will edit the list myself. [Here is the view only version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhEXH2iMSg73dGFCRXZsVW81R2NhZWI0MW1JU1gtTVE&amp;usp=sharing)

I will start new thread on Monday to figure out scheduling and a general template for people to follow. As of right now the orphaned teams are: Air Force, Arkansas, Arkansas State, Bowling Green, Buffalo, Georgia State, Hawai'i, Houston, Kent State, Louisiana Lafayette, Miami(OH), New Mexico, New Mexico State, Rutgers, San Diego State, San Jose State, Shippensburg (may have only been added as a joke?), South Alabama, Syracuse, Tulsa, UTEP, Western Kentucky, and Wyoming.

Their distinctive “Stop at the Top” marching step, unique to our band, is extremely strenuous and requires massive amounts of energy. [The Run-On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08LEfMYfj1A) is the kick-off to their performance. They also perform the famous fifth quarter celebration after every game; during our periods of football ineptitude, fans would say they were only showing up for the band. They have been led since 1969 by [Mike Leckrone](http://imgur.com/OIDGCIo), who rides in to their spring concert every year in a different, ridiculous manner.

Maybe it’s a cliché, but among college football stadia currently in use, I think Camp Randall has one of the more interesting histories. Camp Randall was originally a Civil War military training post in Madison. More than 70,000 men trained for service within the boundaries of this camp, named after [Alexander W. Randall](http://i.imgur.com/tt1IaIY.jpg), the wartime governor. The land was later turned over to the state as a military training rendezvous and Camp Randall became the state's largest staging point. During the war, the Camp served as the Northern-most Confederate POW Camp, and the [Northern-most Confederate cemetery](http://voices.yahoo.com/the-northernmost-confederate-cemetery-united-4031507.html?cat=37) is located nearby. Purchased by the state in 1893, the land was deeded to the University of Wisconsin. As a memorial to Wisconsin's Civil War soldiers, a small segment of the land was set aside as a park and the [Memorial Arch was completed in 1912](http://i.imgur.com/OPKgh4k.jpg). This very arch still stands on the grounds today and it is tradition for the [band to walk underneath it before each game](http://i.imgur.com/FozxRKc.jpg). The stadium as it exists today seats a little more than 80,000 spectators, and about [14,000 of them are students](http://i.imgur.com/EJmx3JK.jpg). It’s truly a place where magic happens! The video board is currently undergoing renovations as I type this!

* James White (RB) - Fast running back that hasn’t ever been the feature guy, but has always been a great change of pace. Extremely quick.

* Melvin Gordon (RB) - Montee Ball said Melvin is more talented than he is. He’s amazingly fast, runs like a gazelle, and might be the next great back. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8R26lY_QYc&amp;t=2m40s) is my favorite highlight him from his 9 carry, 216 yard outburst against Nebraska.

* Jared Abbrederis (WR) - Our only receiving threat that isn't a tight end. He’s fast, has dirty, dirty moves, and is hard to tackle. He’s the latest in a long history of great walk-on players.

* The offensive line - Wisconsin breeds offensive linemen. They are the key to everything we do and they are our best asset.

**Biggest Plays:**

* [Montee Ball Stiffarm](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1818515/stiffgif.gif)

* [Russell Wilson Hail Mary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYiufCViwhg) and [Brad Nortman’s wonderfully executed running into the kicker penalty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKMnwcbVBdg&amp;t=0m40s), which should be played every time someone shows the OSU or MSU hail marys. [Brad Nortman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKvOZueACjI) also got us to another Rose Bowl, making him probably the only punter that has made two huge plays to get his team to two Rose Bowls.

*The Greats*

****

**Greatest Games:**

* 1993 Rose Bowl win over UCLA, 21-16

This is what most Badger fans view as the game that single-handedly brought us from a bottom dweller in the Big 10 to a team that deserved to be acknowledged.  Barry in a matter of 4 years had done what many thought impossible - he won a Rose Bowl with Wisconsin.

* 1998 Rose Bowl win over UCLA, 38-31

Where Craig James said Wisconsin was the [worst team to ever play in a Rose Bowl](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324274404578211612240228242.html),  Barry’s response was pretty epic.

* 1999 Rose Bowl win over Stanford, 17-9

With this win the Badgers became the first Big 10 team to ever win back-to-back Rose Bowls.

* 2003 Big 10 win over Ohio St. 17-10.

Wisconsin hosted then #3 Ohio St. - who at the time held the nation’s longest winning streak at 19 games.  With just under 6 minutes left backup quarterback Matt Schabert tossed a [79 yard bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4sLYNI2PLg) to a open Lee Evans, who took it to the crib.  The game had a bit of controversy because the Badger’s starting quarterback, Jim Sorgi, had to be taken out because OSU linebacker Robert Reynolds pushed his hand/fingers onto Sorgi’s throat, making Sorgi unable to speak.

* 2010 regular season win over #1 Ohio State, 31-18

One of the best Camp Randall atmosphere’s I’ve ever experienced, [soak it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8SfDAkdVl4)

* 2005 Paul Bunyan’s Axe win over #22 Minnesota, 38-34, [IT’S BLOCKED!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfIA7lhsSKs)

* [Every Big Ten Championship Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCk5Fnnqk0) that has [ever happened.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8R26lY_QYc)

2011 vs. MSU and 2012 vs. Nebraska.

****

**Greatest Players:**

* **Ron Dayne:**

Holds the all-time NCAA rushing yards record at 6,397, also won the Heisman trophy in 1999.  A member of the Rose Bowl and College Football hall of fame, Dayne is truly of the of all-time greats.  Also, when he came to UW he was 270 pounds, one of the main reasons he went to UW was because UW was one of the few (if only) schools that offered him at RB and not FB or DT/LB.

* **Dave Schreiner**

A two time All-American at end and member of the College Football Hall of fame.  Died in action in WWII.


* **Joe Thomas**

A 3-time starter at LT, unanimous All-American in 2006, Outland Trophy Winner (2006), and an very talented shot putter for the Wisconsin Badgers from 2003 - 2006.  Thomas now makes a living pushing people around for the Cleveland Browns as one of the best linemen in the NFL.


* **Alan “The Horse” Ameche:**

In 1954 was the first Badger to win a Heisman trophy, and at the time held the record for most career rushing yards with 3,212.  Also scored the winning touchdown over the New York Giants in the 1958 NFL Championship game as a member of the Baltimore Colts.  This game is commonly known as, “The Greatest Game Ever Played”.

* **Elroy “Crazylegs” Hirsch:**

Great running back for UW/Michigan in the 1940s, also served as UW’s athletic director from 1969-1987.  Named to the NFL’s all decade team of the 1950s.

* **Pat Richter:**

Badger legend.  9 time letterwinner (last to do so).  3 times each in football, basketball, and baseball.  Was a two-time All-American as a tight end, first round draft pick to the Denver Broncos, served as athletic director from 1989 - 2004, and was largely responsible for the revolution of Badger athletics (hired Barry Alvarez, built the Kohl Center, renovated Camp Randall, etc.).

* **Lee Evans.**

Badger WR from 2000-2003, in 2001 Evans had 75 rec, 1545 yards, and 9 touchdowns, and in 2003 Evans had 64 rec, 1213 yards, and 13 touchdowns.  By the time he left UW, Evans was the leader or amongst the leaders in each category.  First round draft pick by the Buffalo Bills.

* **Montee Ball:**

Holds multiple records (tied for most touchdowns in a season: 39, most points by a non-kicker in a season: 236, most career touchdowns: 83, most career rushing touchdowns: 77).  Won the Doak walker in 2012, Heisman candidate in 2011, and was a 2-time All-American (2011, 2012).  Was a HUGE factor in Wisconsin’s recent success in the B1G conference.

**Honorable mention**: Russell Wilson and JJ Watt

Both had only one notable year (Wilson because he was here for only one year, JJ because he exploded onto the scene in 2010 as a Junior).  But it can’t take away from the fact that both were fantastic Badgers.



****

**Greatest Coaches:**


* **Barry Alvarez:**

Barry resurrected a moribund Badger football program in 1990 and continues to provide leadership for the entire athletic department to this day. He is best coach in Wisconsin history and it’s not even close. Alvarez’s record while at UW was 118-74-4 and was 8-4 in bowl games. While he roamed the sidelines, Barry won/shared three B1G championships and three Rose Bowl titles (SUCK IT UCLA!^sorry ). He was national and B1G coach of the year in 1993 and B1G coach of the year in 1998. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2010 and started serving as the AD at Wisconsin in 2004.

* **Bret Bielema.**

[“The chart says go for two.”]( http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/jack_mccallum/10/11/sportsmanship/index.html)

Although we are currently a little mad at Bret, and many Wisconsin fans hated him, the dude won a lot of games. Bielema’s record at Wisconsin was 68-24 with a 2-4 record in bowl games. He was named conference coach of the year in 2006. He lead Wisconsin to three straight B1G Championship game victories and Rose Bowl berths. You’ll notice that we chose “berths” instead of “victories” and that’s probably because we lost all three Rose Bowl games. Fucking Tank Carder. Anywho, Bielema continued the success that Alvarez had wrought and made Wisconsin into more of a national brand, but seemed to rub many of the Wisconsin faithful the wrong way. Throughout Bielema’s tenure, for every brilliant play-call [(see Brad Nortman’s fake punt against Iowa)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKvOZueACjI) there were myriad boneheaded decisions that left fans searching for answers. It always seemed like Wisconsin was this close to something great only to come up short and, fair or not, that always comes back to the head coach.  

Fun fact: Only 1 starting left tackle under Bielema’s reign failed to win an Outland Trophy (Joe Thomas and Gabe Carimi won, Ricky Wagner did not).

**Greatest Rivalries:**

* [](/minnesota) - **Minnesota:** [Paul Bunyan's Axe](http://i.imgur.com/OQFczvh.jpg)/ [Slab of Bacon](http://i.imgur.com/O21wU6n.jpg). Minnesota leads series 58-56-8

The trophy is a symbol of one of the most storied rivalries in college football, representing the most-played rivalry in Division I-A football, with 122 editions dating back to 1890. The Golden Gophers lead the all-time series 58-56-8, while the Badgers lead the Axe series 38-24-3 with a current 9 game win streak.

The Paul Bunyan Axe was created by the Wisconsin letterwinners' organization (the National W Club) and would be instituted as the trophy in the series in 1948. The scores of each game are recorded on the axe's handle, which is 6 feet long. The original axe was retired after the 2003 game and a new axe was created for the 2004 game. When the game ends, if the team holding the trophy wins, they run to their own sideline, take the axe and carry it around the field. If the team not holding the trophy wins, they are allowed to run to their opponents' sideline and ""steal"" the axe away. Usually, after the winning team claims the axe, it is custom for the team to carry the axe to one of the goal posts and ""chop"" it down with the axe.

Previously the game was played for the “Slab of Bacon” trophy,.The Slab of Bacon was created in 1930 as a way for the universities to commemorate their rivalry. The Slab of Bacon was a piece of black walnut wood carved with a football topped by a letter W or M, depending on which end it was hung from. It was carved by Dr. R. B. Fouch of Minneapolis. Scores of each Wisconsin–Minnesota game were printed on the back of the trophy. When the trophy changed hands, it was presented to the winning school by a sorority from the losing school.

After the Gophers' 1943 victory, a ceremonial exchange was supposed to take place, but the officials involved could not find each other on the field. Wisconsin sent the trophy to Minnesota's locker room. The Gophers' coach at the time, Dr. George Hauser, refused to accept it, stating he believed ""such trophies should be out for the duration"" (of World War II). The trophy disappeared and was replaced by Paul Bunyan's Axe in 1948.

The Slab of Bacon was missing until 1994, when it was discovered in a storage room at the Wisconsin Athletic Department during a renovation of Camp Randall Stadium. Although allegedly ""lost,"" it had been maintained: as the scores of every Wisconsin-Minnesota game from 1930 through 1970 were evident on the back of the slab.

The Slab of Bacon is currently housed in the Wisconsin football office at Camp Randall Stadium. ""We took home the bacon,"" then-head coach Barry Alvarez said, ""and kept it.""


* [](/iowa) - **Iowa:** [Heartland Trophy](http://i.imgur.com/6pAOqZd.jpg). While this rivalry has been on hiatus for a couple years, it is still very intense. The all-time series is tied at 42-42-2. Although the rivalry is over one-hundred years old, the trophy is a relatively new addition. It was first presented in 2004 to Iowa, when they defeated Wisconsin 30–7. In 2005, Iowa spoiled the last home game for Wisconsin head coach Barry Alvarez, defeating the Badgers at a rain-soaked Camp Randall Stadium, by a score of 20–10. The Badgers took possession of the trophy for the first time in 2006, defeating Iowa 24–21 in a back-and-forth affair. Wisconsin evened the Heartland Trophy series in 2007, winning another closely contested game 17–13, under the lights at Camp Randall. In 2008, Iowa took the lead in the trophy series, riding a second-half performance to a lopsided 38-16 victory. The Hawkeyes' second-half performance was key again in 2009, as Iowa won the contest 20-10 in Madison. The 2010 game was decided in the final minute, as the Badgers scored a late touchdown in the 31-30 victory at Kinnick Stadium. With Wisconsin and Iowa in the same division starting in 2014, look for this rivalry to only get more intense.

*Campus and Surrounding Area*

***

**City Population:**

Madison: 236,901

[**City Skyline**](http://madisonwihotelhj.com/images/slide-1.jpg)

**Iconic Campus Buildings:**

* [Bascom Hall](http://i.imgur.com/vYzWoI1.jpg): Sitting atop the picturesque [Bascom Hill](http://imgur.com/MtqndhE)--which is a pain in the ass to walk up on your way to class--[Bascom Hall](http://imgur.com/k9bMU9B) is the main administration building on campus. None other than Abraham Lincoln sits in front of it—and the reason he’s there is a source of some confusion. Aside from the Republican Party (of which Lincoln was a member) being founded in Ripon, Wisconsin, he really doesn’t have any ties to the state or university. But he was responsible for the land grant program that made the university possible, which is why his statue is on a campus that he never saw. Graduating seniors [sit on his lap](http://imgur.com/reWb9cK) and whisper their academic, career-based, or romantic hopes and dreams into his ear for the supposed good luck it brings. People often rub his foot for good luck. The hill itself has served as both a place for [orators to deliver speeches](http://imgur.com/ZvgReSE), and [a snowy battlefield](http://vimeo.com/8154855) among other things.

* [Union South](http://i.imgur.com/dB7j6iK.jpg): One of the newer buildings on campus, Union South is on the opposite side of campus, and features everything from a sit-down restaurant (“The Sett”) to a rock-climbing wall, to a bowling alley, to a hotel, and it even has its own movie theater. Union South and Memorial Union are somewhat unique in that following the longstanding Wisconsin tradition, they are two of a select group of Union buildings where alcohol is served. Union South itself has two bars—one in “The Sett” and another adjacent to a coffee shop. It is also the greenest student union in the country; it is state-of-the-art in its energy-saving methods and much of the building materials were recycled from other buildings.

* [Memorial Union](http://i.imgur.com/3cfOXLw.jpg): Completed in 1928, the Wisconsin Memorial Union sits on Lake Mendota and houses [Der Rathskeller](http://i.imgur.com/tJnUsE2.jpg), a German beer hall that hosts concerts. (Wisconsin, as a state, was strongly influenced by German immigrants.) It also houses the Memorial Union theater and the gorgeous [Memorial Union Terrace](http://i.imgur.com/VGyODj1.jpg), an outdoor dining and drinking area known for its calming and spectacular [sunsets.](http://i.imgur.com/4VNizhg.jpg)

* [Wisconsin State Capitol Building](http://i.imgur.com/VKldsct.jpg): While not strictly on campus, the Wisconsin State Capitol is perhaps Madison’s greatest architectural treasure. Its central location on the isthmus, the fact that it was built on a hill, and the fact that city regulations stating no building within a certain distance can be built taller than the dome are a near-guarantee that it can be seen from nearly anywhere on campus or in the city. The famous (or is it infamous?) [State Street leads up to the capitol building](http://i.imgur.com/5rwMZjL.jpg) and the [beautiful downtown area surrounding it](http://i.imgur.com/JMH93Gg.jpg). Atop the capitol stands the enigmatic [“golden lady”](http://i.imgur.com/I8lTPGQ.jpg), a figure of Athena who is holding an eagle, wearing a badger on her head (lol), and signaling “forward”--Wisconsin’s state motto, from which “On Wisconsin” is derived.


**Local Dining:**

* [Mickies Dairy Bar](http://i.imgur.com/BmS8L7q.jpg) is where you go for breakfast. It is delicious, order the [Scrambler](http://i.imgur.com/U9Hs8UC.jpg). Mickies is right across from the stadium. It’s open from 6am til 2pm, get there early or there will be a line out the door.

* Beer is a food, right? Go to the beautiful [Memorial Union Terrace](http://photos.uc.wisc.edu/photos/10752/original/Terrace_overviewdusk09_7167.jpg?1286762723) and drink a beer while sitting by the lake. New Glarus Brewery only sells in Wisconsin; most of their offerings are delicious. Play some sheepshead, too. Edit: /u/_honestly reminded us that [Babcock Ice cream is a thing.](http://babcockhalldairystore.wisc.edu/product-category/ice-cream/) We make our own ice cream from our own cows on campus and it's delicious.

* [Ian’s Pizza](http://ianspizza.com/) is a staple drunken stop for late night food.  A fantastic selection of unique pizzas at reasonable prices make it a fantastic place to swing after the bars.  They’re most known for their delicious [Mac n Cheese pizza](http://i.imgur.com/nSaOYsm.jpg).

* A walk down [State Street](http://i.imgur.com/SvV3QFA.jpg) provides a plethora of available resturants, too many to list here.  Walking to the Capital, you’ll see [The Old Fashioned](http://www.theoldfashioned.com/).  Stop in for arguably the best [cheese curds](http://i.imgur.com/S2BWdlB.jpg) in the city and order one of 52 available tap or over 100 available bottle beers, everything coming from a Wisconsin brewery. The import list currently consists of one beer, Grainbelt, from neighboring Minnesota. It takes after its football team and is terrible.

*Random Trivia/ Traditions*

* [Jump Around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veHQMaxiOmg) is everyone’s favorite tradition. After the 3rd Quarter, everyone holds four fingers in the air, awaiting the start of the fourth quarter. The second the first chord plays, everyone cheers, and then the crowd starts jumping. The tradition started in 1998 as just something to fill time and keep people excited, but the students went nuts so they kept playing it. In 2003, the AD Pat Richter said not to play the song due to structural concerns while Camp Randall was under construction. After thousands of letters, emails, and phone messages, university engineers conducted a safety examination and determined it was safe. Jump Around was played the next week and has been played ever since.

* [The Fifth Quarter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjid0EA6K1c). After every game, win, lose, or draw, the band goes on the field and puts on a postgame performance. The students know song-specific dances to everything the band plays, such as Tequila, a modified version of the “2001, a Space Odyssey” theme, Swingtown, and, of course, the Chicken Dance. It’s pretty amazing to see several thousand people do the Chicken Dance in public. Swingtown isn’t allowed to be played during the game because during the [oooOOOOOOOOOOOOO](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX6Kd6lWno) part, everyone would yell “SUCKS!” at section O of the student section, to which section ‘O’ would reply, “F*** YOU!” and the rest of the students would reply “EAT SH*T!” This was the start of the infamous “ESFU” chant that the administration hates.

* [Varsity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE4kxkiAJyI) - Varsity is our alma mater. The band plays it after their halftime performance and after games. Everyone in the stadium puts their arms around each other and sings, culminating in the hand wave at the very end to “U-RAH-RAH-WISCONSIN!” The students traditionally rush.

* Piped-in Music: The student section will sing along to anything the sound guy puts on. Favorites are Sweet Caroline, the Beatles “Seventeen,” “Shout,” and, of course, [Build Me up Buttercup](www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-zFr1WA0ZU). (Full version [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnYCdKDI5hk)). The singing never ends when the music stops.

*Random tidbits:*

* Madison has been called the Best College Sports Town by both the [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2012/10/11/madison-wisconsin-best-college-football-town/1628263/) and [Scott Van Pelt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DchbLXhIt8M), who we love very much.

* The Wisconsin Women’s Hockey team has won four national titles since 2006, although those damn Gophers have the last two. At the 2010 Olympics, 8 current or former Badgers were on the US Olympic team, 2 played for the Canadians, and Mark Johnson, our head coach and member of the [1980 Olympic hockey team](http://i.imgur.com/M6iRwGn.jpg), coached the team.

* We’re the only college campus located on an Isthmus. Madison is located between 3 lakes, and is [extremely](http://i.imgur.com/glH5cLJ.jpg). [pretty](http://i.imgur.com/H2bS9R2.jpg).

* Harry Steenbock, a Wisconsin alumni, invented a technique of applying UV light to food which increases its Vitamin D content and prevents rickets.

* Wisconsin has the oldest Genetics Department in the United States (founded in 1910), and still today a massive research budget keeps the Wisconsin biosciences departments on the cutting edge. For example, cell biologist James Thompson derived the first line of human embryonic stem cells in 1998.

* Joel Stave, who seems to have the inside track at being the starting quarterback, is [so damn dreamy](http://i.imgur.com/lF81nN3.jpg). Some on campus call him Sunshine because of his luxurious flowing golden locks. [Swoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-ZnK2-U3dM)

* The annual [State Street Halloween Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Street_Halloween_Party) attracts constumed party-goers from universities across Wisconsin and the Midwest.

* Wisconsin is one of the top public schools in the nation. We are frequently rated in the top of the country and in the world  [for undergraduate programs, research, academic reputation, value, and for doctoral programs.](http://www.news.wisc.edu/19752) [Here is a massive list](http://www.news.wisc.edu/rankings) of all our high rankings, which span all academic fields.

*What Is and What is to Come*

***

2012 was a strange year for Wisconsin. We suffered through six defeats and massive turmoil. It started after the first two games, when we fired our O-Line coach Mike Markuson, who replaced the absurdly effective Bob Bostad. Bart Miller, a graduate assistant, took over, and soon had the line back to old form. After our loss at Nebraska, the season was pretty easy to predict - If you could match up with our offensive line, you had a very good chance of winning, and probably did (MSU, OSU, PSU, Stanford). If not, we ran all over you (Purdue, MN, Indiana, Illinois, and Nebraska part deux).

We went through 3 starting quarterbacks; Joel Stave took over after Danny O’Brien showed that he had the pocket presence of a jellyfish. After Stave broke his collarbone, senior Curt Phillips stepped in and was serviceable, displaying excellent handoff technique in the two victories he led us to. He led beautiful two minute drills against Indiana and Nebraska to end the halves by handing to James White and Melvin Gordon, respectively, for long runs. In all seriousness, the dude looked like he turned into Johnny Unitas for two-minute drills late in regulation against Ohio State and Penn State.

Finally, [Bret Bielema](http://i.imgur.com/sfWtoiL.jpg) left us for Arkansas after the Rose Bowl game. Barry Alvarez stepped in to coach the Rose Bowl, and we hired Gary Andersen to fill the void.

While we lost 6 games, we went to the Rose Bowl, won the Big Ten Championship, and lost those 6 games by a combined 26 points. 3 of the games were in overtime. Wisconsin was not as bad as 8-6 seems.

**2013 Season**

2013 is a very, very interesting year for us. We have an entirely new coaching staff, but, unlike last year, the offensive line scheme is the same, which is a huge relief for all Badgers. While we return many starters, we lose all-time NCAA touchdown king Montee Ball, two draft-pick O-Linemen, and three starters in the defensive secondary. We also do not have a clear-cut starting quarterback yet, although Stave and Phillips have distanced themselves from the Bart Houston and Danny O’Brien. Tanner McEvoy arrives in fall camp to add still more mystery to the position.

We also will be shifting from a 4-3 to a 3-4 defensively. There will be more blitzing and man coverage than we’re used to, which should be nice as many Badger fans complained about the short completions we allowed in our soft zone. I personally think those people are fools; our defense was excellent last year. Although we have a new coach, we will keep the same mentality of smashmouth football that makes us who we are. Coach Andersen has 6 recruits committed for next year, all but one play on the lines and 5 are from Wisconsin.

With a relatively easy schedule... Okay fine, with a ridiculously easy schedule, many expect Wisconsin to post at least 8-10 wins.  But, as does happen with new coaches, the amount of wins could be swayed 1-2 in either direction. Without any bias, expect Wisconsin to finish the regular season in 2nd or 3rd place of the Leaders Division with 2 or 3 losses. Best case scenario, Wisconsin, with the help of Gary Andersen’s magic, lose only 1 game in the regular season, go to their 3rd straight B1G title, and go to the Rose Bowl for a 4th straight year (but this is like... wet-dream level outcomes here.)

With a new coach in Gary Andersen many Badger fans hope he can be the coach to push us to the next level.  While Andersen is keeping Wisconsin’s ground-and-pound, recruit [big linemen](http://rivals.yahoo.com/wisconsin/football/recruiting/commitments/2014/wisconsin-36), and use multiple tight ends, he has also said he wants to add some spread option to Wisconsin’s game, is a much more aggressive recruiter, and has added many [new wrinkles to Wisconsin’s practices](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/college-football/news/20130419/gary-andersen-wisconsin/).

It’s far too early to tell what Gary can do, but we’re optimistic here in Madison.

Minnesota was my safety school. On Wisconsin.

**Rivals**

**[Clemson:](http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/slides/photos/000/117/532/RackMultipart.11280.0_display_image.jpg?1258642594)** These teams first met in 1898 with [CU](http://media.thestate.com/smedia/2009/09/10/23/1691.standalone.prod_affiliate.74.JPG) winning the first four before John Heisman decided he was tired of coaching for the [bad guys](http://cdn.bleacherreport.com/images_root/image_pictures/0640/7993/19253_crop_340x234.jpg) and left for greener pastures. (We offered him a 450$ pay raise, a 25% salary increase.) Also of note, these two teams did not play a game in [Clemson](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/494150/rackmultipart.3916.0_display_image.jpg) until 1974. We figured that we weren't going to go break our ankles playing in some uneven cow pasture, and that if these [hicks](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_laqu9y5Mwy1qzvravo1_500.jpg) wanted to play a game they could come down to civilization to do it. Since Tech joined the ACC, this game has consistently been very close; Since 1983, the series is at 16-15 with a slight Tech advantage. Tech also leads the overall series 50-25-2. In 2009, we beat them [twice](http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/ACC+Championship+Clemson+v+Georgia+Tech+OPnOcjqCxzil.jpg). [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/QPc7t.jpg).

**[Virginia Tech](http://www.dictailgate.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/overzealous_hokies.JPG):** This is beginning to become a rivalry. Since the ACC has gone to divisions, one of these two teams has represented the coastal in the championship game. These games also tend to be very close with three of the last five games ending with a margin of victory of 7 or less. [VPI&amp;SU](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_RVLfSMIB7K0/RyshBxQEbRI/AAAAAAAADKA/N-_b0VUdub8/s400/001wrongjersey.jpg) leads the overall series 7-3. Let’s not forget that [Marcus Vick](http://www.badjocks.com/archive/2006/marcus_vick_with_guns.JPG) went to [vpi](http://sportige.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Virginia-Tech-Fan-150x150.jpg).

**[georgia:](http://s199.photobucket.com/user/tbear_12/media/n12804726308153765569js1.jpg.html)** Fuck [u(sic)ga](http://s101.photobucket.com/user/kat4gators/media/mullet.jpg.html). These teams first met in 1893 and Georgia Tech came out victorious 28-6 on four scores by Leonard Wood, a future medal of honor recipient. From Wikipedia: “During and after the game, disgruntled [georgia](http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/595859/155111_422343489566_226847794566_4659463_2167116_n.jpg) fans threw rocks and other debris at the Georgia Tech players and chased the victorious Blacksmiths (our nickname at the time) back to their awaiting train.” Taken from a newspaper article at the time: “At one time early in the last half of the game, a stone was hurled at one of the Tech players, striking him a cruel blow in the head... At another time, one of the [Athenians](http://oi39.tinypic.com/nywjef.jpg) drew a knife and threatened one of the Techs' better players... The Techs were also poked and gouged with canes on plays toward the boundary lines... Some of the crowd had the privilege of the gridiron equally with the players.” The [Athenians](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2050/2175663746_28c9d11f48_o.jpg) were upset, and they searched all day and night for someone in Athens that could actually read and write, so that they could falsely insinuate that Tech used ringers by accusing Tech in the AJC the next day of using: “a heterogeneous collection of Atlanta residents - a United States Army surgeon, a medical student, a lawyer, and an insurance agent among them, with here and there a student of Georgia's School of Technology thrown in to give the mixture a Technological flavor.” It should be noted that all Tech players that day were current students and would go on to receive degrees from Tech. So that’s how it started, and I won’t go into depth on this because it would take all day. [To hell with georgia.](http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/slides/photos/000/343/423/93538343_display_image.jpg?1281800431)

**Auburn:** A defunct rivalry that had been played more than 80 times. Auburn Univ. or A.P.I. is by far Georgia Tech's second-most-often played opponent in football. For many years, the rivalry between Georgia Tech and A.P.I. in football became so heated that the annual games were not played in Atlanta or Auburn, but rather at the neutral site of a stadium in Columbus, Georgia, very close to the boundary between the two states. This is a friendly reminder that Auburn lost to Reggie Ball. Twice.

**Alabama:** This is known for the most epic coaching dual in southern football history; Dodd vs. Bryant. This rivalry was so intense that it’s actually the reason Georgia Tech isn’t in the SEC anymore. It began in 1961 when Alabama’s Darwin Holt cold-cocked Georgia Tech’s Chick Granning. The blow actually ended the career of Granning. Yellow Jacket coach Bobby Dodd was understandably peeved and wrote a letter to Alabama coach Bear Bryant, asking to suspend Holt. Bryant naturally did nothing. The whole incident sparked Dodd’s interest in leaving the SEC. The schools have met 52 times and Alabama leads the series 28-24. But neither have played each other since 1984. A home-and-home series had been set for 2013-2014 but both schools agreed to postpone it and have yet to make it up.

**Honorable mention:** The state of Mississippi: The interesting thing here is that there are no rivalries, there is hardly any history at all. Despite sharing a conference for 32 years, Tech played its first football game in the state of Mississippi in 2009 (at Miss St.). This was similar to the Clemson thing, we didn’t want to play in the middle of nowhere. And apparently these hicks weren’t going to let us dictate where the games were played, so we didn’t play. Tech leads the overall series with Mississippi St. 4-0 and Ole Miss 2-1.

**2012 Season**

**[Record:](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/_/id/59/georgia-tech-yellow-jackets)** 7-7-0 (5-3)

**Coach:** [Paul Johnson](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2496/3895082400_843449cabd.jpg)

**[2012 Roster](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/roster/_/id/59/georgia-tech-yellow-jackets)**

**Key Players:**

**[Tevin Washington](http://www.ramblinwreck.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/tevin_washington_343980.html)** - Almost all of our offense comes from the starting QB spot, whether through passing, rushing, or whoever he gives the ball to, and Tevin did well in his role in 2012. He leaves having put his name all over the GT and the ACC record books

**[Orwin Smith](http://www.ramblinwreck.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/orwin_smith_402626.html)** - The playmaker on offense, he averaged 9.2 ypc for his career from the A-back spot.

**[Jeremiah Attaochu](http://www.ramblinwreck.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/jeremiah_attaochu_710582.html)** - One of the bright spots on our mediocre defense, Jeremiah is tied for 8th in Tech’s all-time sack leader list. He accounted for a little over a third of our sacks last season.

**Biggest Plays:**

* [Ray Beno 9 yard reception for a first down.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWfxI6I5WxY)

* Vad Lee [25 yard TD run](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIe8gJGzR9w). This is exciting because he’s our backup QB and we’ve all got big hopes for him.

* Jamal Golden returns kick [97 yards](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nJnO2Xn5po) and [100 yards.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS1Fz4_I_DM)

* [4th down conversion followed by TD pass towards end of regulation against VT](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBiX6rc0qjQ&amp;t=5m0s).

* [Jemea Thomas interception against Florida State.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBiX6rc0qjQ&amp;t=7m18s)

* [Tevin Washington to Orwin Smith 17 yard TD reception on 3rd and goal against USC](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMl2IZo7mE&amp;t=40m55s)

**2013 Season**

**[2013 Schedule](http://www.ramblinwreck.com/sports/m-footbl/sched/geot-m-footbl-sched.html)**

The schedule makers didn’t do us much of a favor, giving us our first bye week on the second week of the season, and not before our first Thursday night game against conference rival Virginia Tech. Plus 3 of the main Coastal contenders in a row starting with that Thursday night game makes this schedule somewhat front-loaded.

**[2013 Roster](http://www.ramblinwreck.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/geot-m-footbl-mtt.html)**

**The Greats**

**Greatest Games:** 

* **2008 GT vs uga** - The 08 team was an extremely surprising one, and they brought light to a fan base that hadn’t won against georgia in 7 years. The game started off looking like every other one, but the Jackets came back in the 2nd half, rallying from a 28-12 deficit to win the game 45-42.

* **1976 GT vs ND** - Tech came into the game against #11 Notre Dame with its first 3 QBs injured and was having a poor season overall. But despite their shortcomings, the Jackets upset the Fighting Irish 23-14. And they did it without throwing a pass.

* **1962 GT vs Alabama** - This game is widely considered by older fans as the greatest Tech game ever. Alabama came into the game on a 26 game winning streak and were widely favored. However, the day of the game, the skies opened up and turned Grant Field into a muddy mess. Kim King, future Tech QB and radio announcer, was invited up to Bear Bryant’s hotel room for a recruiting visit. When he and his family walked in, they saw the Bear looking out the window, chain smoking cigarettes. Bryant kept looking out the window saying “This is Dodd’s weather, this is Dodd’s kind of weather.” The he said “Mrs. King, excuse my language ma’am, but that damn Dodd is gonna beat my butt today.” Sure enough, Tech scored first, and held of the Crimson Tide to pull out what Dodd considered his greatest win.

* **1990 GT vs UVA** - Tech went into this game ranked 7th in the nation after starting the season unranked. UVA was ranked 1st. Scott Sisson’s kick at the end of regulation turned us into serious title contenders. [Link](http://www.footballstudyhall.com/2011/5/28/2189221/what-i-love-the-1990-virginia-georgia-tech-game)

**Greatest Plays:** 

* **[Wrong Way Riegals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA8ShsySc48)** - Considered to be one of the worst CFB blunders of all time, Roy Riegals helped Tech to their second national title in the 1929 Rose Bowl. The Cal player picked up a Tech fumble, got turned around, and ran 65 yards the wrong direction. Tech blocked the ensuing Cal punt for a safety, and won the game 8-7.

* **[2008 Tech forces a fumble on the goalline to put away the victory](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyGQ_lyd83E)** - We dominated most of the 2008 game against FSU until starting QB Joshua Nesbitt was hurt. Our offense sputtered and FSU got back into the game. They had the ball, inside the 5, 1 minute left with a timeout on 2nd and goal, and Cooper Taylor, the freshman safety forced a fumble that Rashaad Reid, another freshman, recovered.

* **[2004 Tech beats Clemson on an extremely late pass](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyGQ_lyd83E)** (sorry for the terrible quality, best there is) - Clemson controlled the game almost all the way to the end. But in the last 4.5 minutes, Tech scored 3 TDs, including this one with 11 seconds left to win the game 28-24. Clemson muffed the punt, and Reggie Ball capitalized by throwing a beautiful fade to Calvin Johnson to score the game winner.

**Greatest Players:** 

* **Clint Castleberry** - The only person to have his jersey retired at Tech, Castleberry came in 3rd place in the Heisman voting as a freshman in 1942. As he finished behind two seniors, he was favored to win the next season. He enlisted in the Air Force in 1943, and his B-26 bomber was lost over Africa in 1944.

* **Joe Hamilton** - He led one of the more prolific GT offenses in modern history, and is the standard by which every QB who came after has been measured. He set ACC career record for total yardage, TD passes and Total TDs. He finished runner up in the Heisman voting his senior year, as well as winning the Davey O’Brien award and being named 1st team AA. He is also fondly remembered for beating Georgia twice.

* **Eddie Lee Ivery** - Held the single game rushing record for a time with 356 yards. He gained all of those yards with the flu and in the snow playing at Air Force.

* **Calvin Johnson** - Can’t forget Calvin. An athletic freak who can get to almost any ball thrown to him, yet he has a surprising high level of humility. There really isn’t much else to say that hasn’t already been said a thousand times over.

**Greatest Coaches:** 

* **John Heisman** - The namesake for the Heisman Trophy, John Heisman coached at Tech for 16 years amassing a 102-29-7 record. He is responsible for the most lopsided game in college football history, a 222-0 beating of Cumberland University. He is also the originator of the “hike” call. His 1917 team won Tech’s first national title.

* **William Alexander** - Coached at Tech from 1920-1944 with a record of 134-95-15. He won Tech’s second national title in 1928. The basketball arena was named after him before a donor gave money to rebuild it.

* **Bobby Dodd** - One of the most interesting coaches ever, Dodd coached at Tech from 1945-1966 with a record of 165-64-8. Known as one of the best in-game coaches of his time, he was famous for “Dodd’s Luck”, a phenomena that routinely saw his teams pull out late game victories. The coach of the year trophy is named after him, as is Bobby Dodd Stadium. He is one of 3 men to be in the college football hall of fame as a player and a coach. I highly recommend his biography, Dodd’s Luck, it’s full of interesting stuff.

**Traditions**

* While we are officially known as the Yellow Jackets, we have another popular mascot, the [Ramblin Wreck](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Ramblinwreck.jpg/300px-Ramblinwreck.jpg). The Ramblin Wreck made its first appearance in 1916, and was the personal car of a student at the time. While it was originally a 1916 Model T Ford, the current Wreck is a 1930 Model A Ford. It led the team out of the tunnel in the 1961 game against Rice University and has continued to lead the team out ever since.

* One of the more popular student traditions is stealing the T from [Tech Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TechTowerSign.jpg). It originated in 1969 and has been done many times since. However, in the interest of safety, stealing the T from the tower was officially banned and extensive security measures were installed on the tower to prevent any more thefts. Now students resort to stealing the letter T off of signs around campus.

* [George P. Burdell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P._Burdell). Read the link, there is just too much for me to explain here.

* [The Budweiser song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhfd8_e1hec) is always performed in the second half of sporting events, about 3/4s of the way through the game and the band is led by Buzz. 

* There are many more great traditions, but I don’t want to try to fit them all here. You can check many of them out [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tech_traditions) if you’re interested.

**Campus and Surrounding Area**

**City Population:** Atlanta proper: 432,427; Metro area: 5,475,213

**City Skyline:** [Downtown](http://www.slrobertson.com/images/usa/georgia/atlanta/downtown/atl-downtown-skyline-pano-2-b.jpg), [Midtown](http://rail.railplanning.com/files/2012/08/Thinkstock_Midtown-Atlanta-skyline_148403778.jpg), and [Buckhead](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3099/2802576871_95f8304b98_b.jpg)

**Iconic Campus Building:** [Tech Tower](http://www.gatech.edu/images/splashFactsandFigures.jpg), [another image](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5160/5842762981_b225d9a308_z.jpg). And [one more](http://frenchconference2013.gatech.edu/Pics/TechTowerSnow.jpg).

**Local Dining:** The Varsity: Everytime you see Tech on ESPN, they will talk about eating at the Varsity. They don’t know what they’re talking about, the food there is a more expensive, upgraded version of McDonalds. And definitely don't eat here before a game, as you’ll be needing a toilet shortly afterwards.

**The Vortex:** Regularly featured on the Food Network, the Vortex is a great place for a burger. It’s also located walking distance from campus.

**Carver’s country kitchen:** A meat &amp; 2 ran by an elderly couple until recently. (The husband died and the wife considered closing but now will be reopening in a new location just down the street.) It has been located in an old grocery store with community style seating, and was in what many consider to be a “rough” part of town. This is the best food you will ever eat.

**Random Trivia**

* The motivation for our “Yellow Jacket” moniker is not an insect. This nickname was developed in an era where people would wear suits for everything; it was odd if a man did not wear a sports jacket. This was also an era before gold pigment. So our fans would wear yellow jackets to the games and opposing journalists would often say that the yellow jackets are coming to town.

* Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field is the oldest Division 1 on campus stadium, and this year actually marks its centennial season.

* Tech almost always wears its white jerseys, home or away.

* There are bulldog stickers in many of the on-campus urinals.

* Despite the fact that the namesake for the Heisman Trophy coached at Tech, no Tech player has ever won it. Joe Hamilton and Billy Lothridge have come the closest, finishing second in the voting.

**What Is and What is to Come**

The 2012 season is somewhat bittersweet. We made it to the ACC Championship game, but we lost to Middle Tennessee State. We finally won a bowl game, but we still lost to georgia. While not a terrible season, it can’t qualify as a success either.

Things are looking up for 2013 however. We return 16/22 starters, including our most experienced OL in the Paul Johnson era. Vad Lee, who has been hailed as the QB of the future, is the expected QB starter, and if he lives up to his potential our offense will be extremely dangerous. While we lost playmaker Orwin Smith, we run by committee, so there is plenty of experienced depth waiting to step up and fill that void. With a new DC in Ted Roof, our defense will be switching to a base 4-3 from the base 3-4 that was the hallmark of Coach Groh’s tenure. We never really had the DL talent to run the 3-4, and it really showed. If our defense can improve from mediocre to average, this team could be dangerous. However, if the defense can’t improve, then I predict that 2012 will repeat itself. Just a great offense can only get you so far.

You gave my little brother the best Christmas he's had, and more importantly, you've given him hope.

My dad has been out of a job for quite some time, and to pick up the slack my mom has been working three retail jobs. Since my mom was extremely worried she wouldn't be able to provide good gifts for this Christmas, she tried to come up with other ideas. My brother Seth has always wanted to play for K State. He's always connected with Collin, since my brother doesn't currently play QB; but aspires to reach his goal to do so like Collin did. My mom's friend has a son who goes to K State who left Collin a message about signing this football. Through the greatness of man, these dudes were able to achieve this. Not only that, but apparently this ball was inside a parked car that was hit by a drunk driver. While the car was totaled, this ball somehow survived. It's an amazing Christmas gift, and my brother broke down into tears after he realized what it really was. He thought it came from a store, and as soon as my mom said no and explained he shed his tears of glory. [Here's a picture of him right before my mom said it's real](http://i.imgur.com/RjFwj.png) . There's no pictures of him after since he was embarrassed and turned his back around to hide his tears, but you guys did a truly amazing job.

I also especially want to thank the dude(s) who delivered the note to Collin, and worked with the exchange of the ball. I'm sorry about your car man, I hope it all gets easily taken care of for you.

Edit: Here is what I want: I want a playoff system. I think a lot of people agree with me about this sentiment, yet we still have the BCS formula. Why? Because we, the viewers are complacent about it - the call for playoffs isn't strong enough because people just watch the NCG even if they don't agree with it. I want playoffs and not watching is the best thing I can do to promote that, and anyone else who wants a playoff system should keep in mind - watching the game, supporting the game is casting your vote. Here's mine: I want a playoff, not a rematch.

**Marching Band:** 

Founded in 1879, known as the Marching Red or the Pride of All Nebraska, performs at all home football games and comprises 290 students from seventy academic majors. Their largest audience was their first game at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor on November 19, 2011. They are one of the best-traveled bands in college football, as the Huskers have been to all major bowl games, and are regarded as an excellent marching band, winning the John Philip Sousa Foundation’s Sudler Trophy in 1996 (an award voted on by all NCAA marching band directors), and enjoying a performance onstage at the Kennedy Center as part of the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, DC. The best known (and beloved) songs among fans are “Dear Old Nebraska U” and “Hail Varsity,” which you’ll hear after every touchdown. 

On game days, the band rehearses for two hours inside Memorial Stadium, takes a break for two hours, then meets in Westbrook Music Building in full uniform for instructions and warm-up. The band plays outside Kimball Recital Hall and leads the fans in a traditional march to the stadium, where they perform the “Pregame Spectacular,” including John Philip Sousa’s own University of Nebraska March and the visiting team’s fight song (‘cause Nebraskans are nice like that.)

Located at 600 Stadium Drive in Lincoln, Neb., Memorial Stadium has a recorded capacity of 81,067, but packed in 86,304 fans for the team’s 300th consecutive sellout, September 26, 2009, against Louisiana-Lafayette’s Ragin’ Cajuns. You can’t walk two blocks in Lincoln without hearing about the sellout streak, which has been going on for fifty seasons and numbers 325, I believe, by counting the number of home games since that 300th sellout date. 

Modeled after new conference rival Ohio State’s stadium, Memorial Stadium opened in 1923 and was named in honor of Nebraska’s veterans in the Civil and Spanish-American Wars as well as World War I. The stadium was built in just over 90 working days, containing around 31,000 seats initially. Expansions from 1964-1972 added north and south end zone seats, boosting its capacity to almost 74,000, and in 1999, 42 luxury boxes were added to the stadium. 13 more were added in 2004 as part of a north end zone stands renovation, as well as the 7,000-odd seats that make up the balance of the stadium’s current capacity. Lighting was added in the early 1980s with the first “proper night game” a victory over the Florida State Seminoles on Sept. 6, 1986. 

Two legends from Nebraska’s “golden era” are honored by statues on the north side of the stadium: coach for 25 years, Congressman, and recently retired athletic director Tom Osborne, and QB Brook Berringer, who died in a plane crash in 1996.

**All-time record:** 856-353-40

**Division championships (Big 12 and B1G):** 6 and 1, respectively

**Conference titles:** 43

**National titles:** 5 (1970, 1971, 1994, 1995, 1997)

**Postseason bowls**: 24-25

**Consensus All-Americans:** 53

**Rivals:** 

We’re still trying to figure this out in the context of the B1G. Wikipedia will tell you that our new conference rivals are Iowa; most Nebraska fans would probably not agree with this. For decades, Nebraska and Oklahoma were bitter rivals (see Game of the Century, below); after the Big 8 expanded to the Big 12, Nebraska’s enemy number one were still the Sooners, but the team also had a short-lived North Division rivalry with Colorado, and tangled several times with Texas, who certainly had the Huskers’ number in the years that they contested conference title games and regular season clashes. 

Oklahoma leads the rivalry series 45-38-3, and won a highly anticipated last clash before Nebraska departed the Big 12, crowning the Sooners conference champions in 2010. 

The Colorado rivalry was a bit less clear-cut (and intense), and Nebraska owned the edge in that Big 8/Big 12 series 49-18-2. Three signature wins by Colorado (1986, 1989, and 1990, all against Nebraska teams ranked third in the nation) marked the Buffaloes’ rise to national prominence (and a title) in 1990. Nebraska would essentially own the series through the “golden decade” of the 1990s, then catastrophically let Colorado run all over them in 2001 and again dropped the rivalry game in 2002.

The mirror opposite of the Colorado rivalry for the late 1990s and 2000s was the Texas rivalry – Texas did not consider us a major rival, as they won 9 of 10 games against the Huskers in conference play. Husker fans are still stinging from the loss in 2009’s conference championship.

[2012 Roster](http://www.huskers.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPSID=4&amp;SPID=22&amp;DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;Q_SEASON=2012)

**Key Players 2012:** 

Rex Burkhead, workhorse running back, all around great guy, and 6th round draft pick by the Cincinnati Bengals. Taylor Martinez, the often-brilliant yet mistake-prone quarterback whose mobility in an otherwise disastrous B1G title game against Wisconsin earned him ESPN’s #1 Play of the Day. (See below, Season Highlights)

Ameer Abdullah was the Huskers’ top rusher in 2012, as he filled in for Burkhead during his mid-season injury. Kenny Bell was Martinez’s top receiver, with almost double the receiving yards of his #2 target, Quincy Enunwa. 

On the defensive side of the ball, Will Compton, Daimion Stafford, and Cameron Meredith anchored a Jekyll and Hyde defense seemingly capable of clamping down talented offensive teams one week then giving up buckets of yards and points to a mediocre team the next.

**Season Highlights:** 

[Taylor Martinez's athleticism vs. Wisconsin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Bg4fz99AY) is probably the signature highlight play of last season.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8F8sJsAjnU) seems a well-curated collection for a 10-4 season, which amounts to a frustrating one in Lincoln. It wasn’t the four losses as much as how those losses happened: a UCLA team the Huskers should have easily outmatched, a blowout at #12 bowl-ineligible Ohio State, an even worse debacle against Wisconsin (“The Massacre at Lucas Oil Stadium) in the B1G title game, and a rather heartbreaking loss to SEC runner-ups Georgia in the Citrus Bowl after keeping up with their dynamic offense for three quarters. Aaron Murray’s accuracy devastated the Husker secondary in the fourth quarter as the tired Huskers gave up huge pass plays and failed to stay in the game. 

**Great Games:** 

If I had to pick only two, each would be a part of one of the “championship eras,” 1970’s Game of the Century, linked above and [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Yh867H4Sg)

…and the [1996 Fiesta Bowl]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfusYeGyKok) perhaps the apex of Nebraska’s entire storied history of college football. 

Note especially the “almost safety, then sure thing” at the beginning of the video, while Frazier’s seven-tackle-breaking TD scamper underscored just how many weapons the offense had. Florida was never really in the game. 

Osborne was so classy as a coach that he had third (or fourth?) string QB Matt Turman take victory formation on Florida’s one-yard line rather than go up 69-24. Florida Coach Steve Spurrier was in tears by that point – he had run up the score on so many teams that he probably didn’t even realize the Huskers were not, in fact, trying to give him a taste of his own medicine, and had pulled the vast majority of the first (and second) string from the field by the fourth quarter anyway. 

**The Golden Era (mid-1990s)** was Nebraska’s second such era, the other coming at the end of Coach Bob Devaney’s tenure (in 1970-71) and bringing back-to-back national titles. 

In the seasons between 1993-1997, the Huskers went 60-3, finally breaking through in 1995 against the trash-talking Miami Hurricanes (think Warren Sapp) for their first national crown in 24 years. 

You can pick your measure of excellence for the [1995 team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football_team), widely considered the best in college football history: finishing undefeated atop a conference with three other top-ten teams, never allowing more than 28 points while never scoring below 37, a humiliation and shutout of hated rival Oklahoma in the traditional Thanksgiving game, or a 62-24 victory over highly-regarded #2 Florida in a game that many experts said would be too close to call. College football fans were used to Nebraska getting to the big stage and choking. But after tasting narrow defeat on a wayward FG attempt in 1993 against Florida State, and the elation of victory the year before against Miami, Nebraska completed the trifecta of Florida powerhouse teams in style. 

Two years deserve special mention here: 1984, when Osborne pushed all his chips into the middle of the table and opted for a 2-point conversion to try to win the title outright, and 1997, when he had no such choice because Michigan and Nebraska could not play. (In spite of the volumes of invective leveled at the BCS, that system would have at least insured that those teams would play for a winner-takes-all title, not the title that the Huskers and Wolverines split.) 

The [final play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoNs0mdKAO8) of the 1984 Orange Bowl is still pretty hard to watch for Husker fans, but here it is. Losing to Miami in such fashion made beating them eleven years later just that much sweeter.

**A few fun facts:** Nebraskans usually don't care about the NFL much, as our team is literally the only game in town/the state. The stadium, every Saturday, functionally becomes the third largest city in the state (behind Omaha and Lincoln.) 

**My bio** I was Nebraska born (1982) and raised by two Nebraskans, did not attend UNL myself, but have remained a lifelong and loyal fan of the team, even through the [Callahan years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football#The_Post-Osborne_era_.281998-present.29) of the mid-2000s. Like I said, Nebraskans are not fond of talking about those years. 

**My fellow Husker fans, help me out!** I don't know much about the pre-1990s of Husker football, nor much of the ""local lore"" that surrounds the team and its fans as I left the state at the age of 9. I also don't know a lot about the B1G move and some other things that might interest those less familiar with our team.

**Edits**: Added T-nawtical's list of current NFL players who were Huskers, added picture of Bo Pelini, a few formats and aesthetic tweaks. Added a more high-fidelity recording of Hail Varsity! that lacks the game-day atmosphere but is a clearer rendition of the song.

To those new to the subreddit, it has been our tradition for the last few seasons to organize and post weekly a poll of CFB voters to see what we think versus the rest of the polls. [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/16a6bk/official_rcfb_poll_final_2012_rankings/) the thread from the final poll of last season as an example. Voters submit their votes to rcfbpoll.com, and then the results are tallied and posted to a weekly thread as well as on that site.

We have, so far, 124 returning voters from last season, but we'd like to increase that number to about 200 and try to sustain it for the season. As such, /u/redbenn and I (the current poll administrators) are going to be adding around 80 new applicants, and then will use the rest of the applications as a waiting list to replace those who drop out.

[**CLICK HERE TO APPLY**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1G2acCANMPXB5W2rUdxHEptWvYLU9yU9iwODICnoZcLg/viewform)

The returning voters have already filled out a survey which I'll use to resolve some of the linger issues from last season. You can see the full results of that survey (and runoff) [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsNXeux1PygKdDJOLUFDQ0xTRTRCSjdoMk9pM2JhMWc&amp;usp=sharing).

In summary,

* Based on 67% of votes, voters (after the two week optional period), can miss no more than three weeks per season to maintain voter status.  

* Though a slight majority preferred a Monday morning deadline, enough users will have issues with that deadline such that **the poll will be due Tuesday mornings at 7 AM EST** and the results subsequently posted after I process them.  

* After two runoffs, the majority preference of returning voters regarding ineligible teams was that **postseason ineligible teams not be considered as part of the poll**. As such, Penn State will not be eligible for votes in the poll this season.

* The median voter pool size was ""About 200"" with similar numbers preferring both more and less. Thus, we will aim for there to be about 200 voters.

**The deadline for the first wave of invites is August 13th.** Users submitting applications after the deadline will be added to the waiting list for subsequent waves of invites this season. The deadline will give us a week to sort through them before we open up preseason voting. Users will have a week to post their preseason polls which will be due and posted the morning of the 27th in time for the season starting on the 29th.",,False,self,t5_2qm9d,1375731886.0,,auburn,True,t3_1jcn32,http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1jcn32/mod_announcement_now_accepting_new_voters_for_the/,moderator

*Pacific-12 Conference*

***

**Year Founded:** 1880

**Location:** Los Angeles, California

**Total Attendance:** 38,010 (approx. 17,000 undergrad and 21,000 grad)

**Nickname:** Trojans

So why name your team after glorious warriors who were *defeated* in battle? It makes sense if you put USC into the historical context of the region: modern California first developed around the Bay Area. When USC was founded in 1880, LA was a backwater with a population of 20,000. For some perspective, here's a rare [aerial balloon photo of LA from 1887](http://i.imgur.com/aS2IRc7.jpg) (north is roughly to the left); USC was founded on the southern edge of (town off the photo to the right) next to a fair ground called “Agricultural Park” (now Exposition Park). Meanwhile, despite being founded 8 years after USC, Stanford jumped ahead in every category because it was closer to the wealth and population. This gap translated into sports: although USC established itself as the most respectable regional program in contests between Oxy, Pomona, Whittier, Caltech and Loyola, it would routinely get *crushed* by Stanford and Cal.

During those early years the school had unofficial names like the Fighting Methodists or Wesleyans (which is odd because the school was never particularly religious and dropped it altogether not long into its history, more on that later). Finally, in 1912 (during a stretch where all California schools dropped football for rugby), a reporter assigned to cover an intercollegiate track meet noted that the USC players were competing hard despite an obvious lack of financial resources in a noble battle for the sake of sport. He said they “fought like Trojans.” The name quickly stuck. Soon afterward, Los Angeles and USC quickly grew up in size and relative power, and the Bay Area and their schools continue to hate both to this day. [As Beano Cook once put it](http://espn.go.com/classic/s/beano_stanusc.html): Stanford and Cal want to beat each other, but they *hate* USC. Interestingly, the feeling isn't mutual. If you want to understand LA, the Big Lebowski and LA Story captured the blase feeling about anything... Dude, let's go bowling.

**Mascot:**

Official: **[Traveler](http://i.imgur.com/93mmUSs.jpg)** – USC's mascot is actually [the white horse](http://sait.usc.edu/recsports/spirit/traveler/home.html)... a *Trojan horse*, if you will, named after Robert E. Lee's trusty steed that rides around the stadium pregame and after touchdowns. Before the track was removed from the LA Coliseum, Traveler would gallop around the track. When Al Davis had the stadium renovated into something more NFL-friendly, they removed the track causing Traveler to run along a much more crowded sideline. Honestly_ was at the 2000 game where that galloping tradition ended as Traveler knocked down a totally unwitting guy on the sideline (the guy was okay). Now the horse has spotters who run ahead of him and clear a path, but it's still not quite as majestic as it used to be.

But Traveler was only the mascot since 1961... what was the USC mascot before that? A dog. But not just any dog: **[George Tirebiter](http://i.imgur.com/I2MDcRw.jpg)**. In the 1940s, students noticed a mangy stray chasing cars on a street through campus. They adopted it and the student body made it a mascot. Despite a penchant for biting tires, opposing mascots and a few people, folks were willing to look past his faults. He was even dognapped and drugged a few times by UCLA students. Alas, Tirebiter I got even more ferocious over time so he was forcibly retired, only to die a year later doing what he loved the most—chasing cars (such is the life of a true hunter).

[](/kiffin) **""QamvIS Hegh qaq law' torvIS yIn qaq puS!""**

He was followed by several other Tirebiters until the school went with the horse. Still, despite his 50+ year absence, [he remains an icon at USC](http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/27/local/me-then27), and his cool [statue, complete with a stack of tires, has a prominent spot on campus](http://i.imgur.com/l7XjrEo.jpg), on the same street he used to chase
cars (which is now pedestrian-only).

Unofficial: **Tommy Trojan**, as represented by [the Trojan Shrine](http://i.imgur.com/YZ8j7z6.jpg) at the heart of campus. The statue is *the* campus icon. Just don't try to pose like him: he's impossibly flexing every muscle in his body at once. Due to Bruin scheming, Tommy is usually [mummified in duct tape during UCLA week](http://i.imgur.com/YPN9Coi.jpg), but occasionally [they strike during off weeks](http://i.imgur.com/L5u6QvZ.jpg). Meanwhile, [the band's drum major is also decked out in an elaborate uniform and conducts the band with a sword](http://i.imgur.com/SiapBNx.jpg). He plants his sword at the center of the field before every game, to the roar of the crowd.

**~~Cheerleaders~~ [USC Song Girls](http://i.imgur.com/68Hg7.jpg)!!!** USC doesn't have cheerleaders, we have a dance squad. [Here are the 2012 photos from their famed, annual summer Tahoe adventure.](http://bustedcoverage.com/2012/08/04/usc-song-girls-get-wet-in-tahoe-2012-edition-52-photos/) Because what's better than a Song Girl? A wet Song Girl. Meanwhile: we used to also have the all-male [Yell Leaders](http://i.imgur.com/NrrJPbI.jpg) (super-preppy guys that could walk on their hands), but they were phased out for a generic co-ed “Spirit Leaders” that deserve no further mention.

**Band:** [The Spirit Of Troy](http://i.imgur.com/pFeMea5.jpg), aka The Trojan Marching Band, aka ""The Greatest Marching Band In The History Of The Universe"". A contingent of the band has performed at every USC football game, home *and away*, since 1987, and the entire band always travels to South Bend for Notre Dame. This is Hollywood's college band, having appeared in a variety of shows and movies, ranging from the Naked Gun, to playing Alabama's band in Forrest Gump, to Glee. The band has played multiple Academy Awards (my favorite was “Blame Canada” in 2000), multiple Grammys (with Outkast and Radiohead), on American Idol, at Coachella and travels internationally every other year. The band famously had a platinum record in 1979 when Fleetwood Mac asked them to perform and record Tusk ([official music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRBtYBhgp_w)); it went platinum again in a later, live recording also with the USC band.
They also make up the house band for the Lakers thanks to late-alum/owner Jerry Buss.

**Fight Song:** Fight On. If you play us, you'll hear it... a *lot*. The lyrics and tune are catchy, and it was used by American soldiers during the Pacific Theater of WWII.

We're also known by our opponents for Tribute to Troy, better known as “This is the only song we know!” (fans love it). I think the best way to hear the fight song and the almost Ben Hur-like sound of our band is to hear it as they play it at the beginning of every football game: combined as [Fanfare, Tribute To Troy, and Fight On](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ7oArZrQ1s). Fanfare makes you want to grab a sword and charge.

We have two other signature songs that deserve mention: [Conquest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8AC-qRzYh4) was actually written as the main theme of the 1947 epic film the Captain from Castile, for which the score was nominated for an Academy Award. During the pauses at the beginning of the song the fans all yell “Beat... the [opposing team's nickname]!” and start imitating the trumpets at the end. The other is Tusk, which was originally created and performed by Fleetwood Mac and the USC band for the eponymous album. It's best known for the chant “[U-C-L-A SUCKS!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv4OkdgJKH0)” Part of the reason is while the UCLA fight song Sons of Westwood actually mentions USC, our fight song was written before they were relevant at sports so Tusk filled the gap.

**First Season:** 1888

**Stadium:** [Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum](http://i.imgur.com/aK6xgdH.jpg) (93,607 capacity): The only stadium to host a combined: 2 Olympiads ('[32](http://i.imgur.com/5RcZyjp.jpg) &amp; '[84](http://i.imgur.com/IvOngc9.jpg)), [Super Bowl](http://i.imgur.com/4IDuVRo.jpg), [World Series](http://i.imgur.com/4yH435c.jpg), Democratic Convention ([Kennedy accepted the nomination here](http://i.imgur.com/qIzCYeL.jpg)), [Papal Visit](http://i.imgur.com/8yiM7T4.jpg), [porn movie(s?)](http://i.imgur.com/Gkc50V1.gif), Hollywood movies, numerous GameDay and All State commercials, monster truck rallies, X-Games, international FIFA exhibition games not involving the US (hey, it's LA!), and much, much more. The Olympic cauldron/torch is [lit at the beginning of the fourth quarter at all USC games.](http://i.imgur.com/4rkeOL7.jpg)

**Stadium Location:** Los Angeles, California, right across the street from campus in Exposition Park. Now you can understand how odd it was when UCLA had it as their home stadium. The stadium is technically a public building, and until very recently was directly managed by the Coliseum Commission, made up of an even split of City/County/State appointees. After years of bungling, corruption (cough-cough, Bernard Parks), and delayed renovation in hopes of luring a new NFL team to do it all for them, USC lawyers skillfully wrested the Master Lease away from the Commission and into the hands of the university. Improvements are coming. Exposition Park also has a lot of cool museums and the popular rose garden. The neighboring Sports Arena used to be the home of the Lakers, Clippers, Kings, and USC arena sports until everyone moved out--USC now plays out of the Galen Center (most recently seen as the site of Microsoft's infamous E3 conference).

**All-time Record:** 779-313-54 (.703)

**Conference Championships:** 38

**Bowl Games:** 31-16 (24-9 Rose Bowl record)

**National Titles (11 claimed):** 1928, 1931, 1932, 1939, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1974, 1978, 2003, 2004*

*BCS and FWAA titles vacated; sorry Auburn, we kept the AP trophy

* For a long time an entire generation of Trojans grew up knowing USC had eight national championships: 1928, 1931, 1932, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1974 and 1978. After USC won its first title in 25 years in 2003, the Athletic Department claimed 1939's 8-0-2 season using something called the Dickinson System. It's dubiously legit, or legitimately dubious. Here's what happened: [Texas A&amp;M won the AP Poll, an undefeated and unscored upon Tennesee team came second and USC came 3rd. In those days the title was awarded before bowl games. USC and Tennessee played in the Rose Bowl which USC won 14-0. A&amp;M defeated #5 Tulane in the Sugar Bowl, 14-13.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_college_football_season#Bowl_Games) (this is why we needed a playoff). So basically we got two titles in one season (one if you ask LSU fans.) With the 2004 title being vacated by everyone except the AP and USC some would say that the Trojans earned three titles nobody
 recognizes
in the span of *two* calendar years, which might be a singular feat in college football. (Looking at you, Bama!)

***
*Rivals:*
***

**Notre Dame** – USC's greatest rival, most respected foe, historical brother-in-arms, yada yada yada. The entire nation gets shovelfuls of this stuff every odd October and even November... and USC fans love it. This really is [an amazing rivalry](http://i.imgur.com/c1plVdN.jpg), one that makes little geographic sense but has produced more national titles, Heisman winners and illegal forward motion assists than any other. Notre Dame leads the series 44-34, with the longest non-losing streak in the rivalry (13-0-1 between 1983-96). The Trojans are currently on a one game losing streak to the Irish. The winner of this game gets the [Jeweled Shillelagh](http://i.imgur.com/bNfK7CJ.jpg), which kind of looks like a knotted emerald and ruby penis (they're actually on the second trophy after the first filled). Little known fact: Brent Musburger has twice collapsed from a priapism (1999, 2005) while calling this game, and each stadium's press box
 has since
been retrofitted with blood pumps to make sure the flow from the venerated announcer's brain to his nethers is even and uninterrupted.

**UCLA** – The largest intra-city FBS rivalry, the intensity of this match-up is somewhat mitigated by everyone having to constantly text each other to see which freeway to take to the game. Separated by a mere 11 miles and a solid hour of traffic, these two schools embody everything you could ask for in a dichotomy: private vs. public, rich vs. slightly less rich (you may be surprised which is which), red vs. blue, one is good at football and one is UCLA, etc. The Bruins enjoyed national and local relevance under Terry Donahue (1975-96) and Bob Toledo (1996-2002) as well as an eight game winning streak vs. the Trojans during the nineties, but USC leads the series 46-29-7. After two tumultuous coaching changes UCLA is currently enjoying a one game winning streak over USC under new coach Jim Mora. The two school shared the same home stadium until 1983, when UCLA moved to the Rose Bowl which is even *farther* away from its campus (USC remains closer to
both stadiums). The winner of this match up gets the Victory Bell, which gets gonged obnoxiously and joyously by the victor during the rivalry game before it's rolled away into fratish secrecy. Both programs have recently agreed to a return to pre-1983 tradition by wearing their [home colors for the annual tilt](http://imgur.com/LCil7Am), making this the handsomest non-Saban rivalry in the nation. The rivalry extends to all sports, and [even non-sports.](http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/10/local/la-me-0510-usc-ucla-brain-research-20130510)

**Stanford** – Unbeknownst to the rest of the nation but knownst to both the current generation of Trojans and anyone who lived prior to 2002, this is an ugly, bitter hatred. Stanford is USC's oldest rival and, during the early and middle parts of the twentieth century, enjoyed regional and national success that pitted it against the West Coast's premier power in USC. That rivalry was renewed with 2007's epic upset at the hands of Jim Harbaugh's Cardinal, somehow using a quarterback named Tavita Pritchard – who is not a lesbian ceramics professor – to defeat a Trojans squad that was favored by 837 points. Harbaugh would go on to hand USC it's worse loss in 43 years by [going for two in a 55-21 beatdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS3VeluAmg). Stanford has won the last five of six against USC, two of them in memorably late fashion. The two bands genuinely hate each other. The victor of this rivalry receives Smugness +1.

[“[The Weekender](http://www.usctrojans.com/blog/2012/09/weekender-rally-in-union-square.html)”, takes places each year when USC plays Stanford or Cal up north, and includes a major rally in Union Square in downtown San Francisco. Alumni in the Bay Area are joined by throngs of SoCal fans and students who make the trip up. This tradition between the three schools (plus UCLA) is what allowed the schools to lobby and stay in the permanent yearly rotation despite being in different divisions... again, where there's a will, there's a way when it comes to scheduling your rivals]

**Cal** – The Bears enjoyed a mid-2000s renaissance, nearly winning the Pac-10, a berth to the Rose Bowl and a national title appearance like, 17 times, but stupid Texas something something. No, seriously, there was a rivalry here under since departed Jeff Tedford, with Cal playing USC nail bitingly close in a four year span with national implications in each game, the highlight of which was the 23-19 USC win on their way to the 2004 national title. The intensity of this rivalry was rekindled after the Trojans' 2003 triple overtime loss in Strawberry Canyon, Cal's last win in the series. This is an old match up dating back to 1915, but it is thoroughly lopsided with USC leading the series 64-29-5. Although it's not really relevant here's [Marshawn Lynch riding a cart.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqMsT_2teus)

*2012 Season, aka The Horror*
***

**Record:** [7-6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_USC_Trojans_football_team#Schedule) (21-7 loss to Georgia Tech in 2012 Sun Bowl)

**Coach:** Lane Kiffin  

[](/kiffin) **“Look, Brohams, I know how last season looked but just don't fucking start with me, m'kay?”**

[**2012 Roster**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_USC_Trojans_football_team#Roster)  

**Key Players:**

* Matt Barkley (Sr. QB) - In many ways, Barkley did more for USC than any other quarterback in the school's long history. He holds the USC and Pac-12 career records for touchdowns (116 passing, 122 total), passing yards (12,237), completions (1,001), attempts (1,562) and total offense (12,214). He has beautiful golden hair and does charity work because he's a good person and could totally boff your sister but wouldn't because he's a gentleman, and also his [AMAs are pretty good](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/x5lrk/iam_matt_barkley_quarterback_of_the_usc_trojans/). And although he never won a Heisman or a national championship you'd be hard pressed to find a USC fan who didn't hold Barkley in the highest regard. As a true freshman starter he helmed the Trojans through a shocking change from Pete Carroll to Kiffin, providing hope and oddly humorous immobility within the pocket during a tenure of pre-sanctions uncertainty and
then terrible, soul destroying certainty. Barkley turned down a probable first round draft selection to return for his senior season in anticipation of a special campaign, which was special but not in that kind of way. Although we are all regretful he didn't get the pay day he deserved, Barkley is probably too busy smiling at a sunflower to care.

* Matt Barkley's Shoulder (RS Sr.) - Though the season didn't rest entirely on MB7's Shoulder, in the end it was The Shoulder that decided the season. A disastrous campaign could have been salvaged with season ending wins against UCLA and Notre Dame, continuing a winning streak and knocking the Irish out of the title game, respectively. Instead we got an unceremonious and frankly horrifying look at the future as RS Fr. QB Max Wittek took the stage and quickly took a big fat dump, followed by an even bigger, fatter dump. Little did we know that it was The Shoulder that wielded the Toilet Paper, and for four wonderful years we were protected by His Throwing Arm Mandate. But now The Shoulder is gone, and with it the Bum Wad. Please ignore any confusing metaphors.

* Marqise Lee (So. WR) - He was not the most heralded. He was, in fact, the least heralded of a remarkable group of Gardena Serra HS wide receivers recruited to USC starting in 2010. Now Lee has shattered the single season Pac-12 receiving record with his 1,721 yards in 2012 winning him the Belitnikoff Award. Lane Kiffin designed every manner of screen imaginable to get his star receiver the ball and probably would have had Lee hike the ball to himself if it were legal. Lee will enter the 2013 season as the face of the team and on a short list of ""most dynamic"" players in the nation, which is to say he'll be a Heisman hopeful until they give it to a QB or RB. But that new award for Most Similar To A Cyborg Gazelle? Lee's going to win that.

* Robert Woods (Jr. WR) - In many way Woods is the perfect symbol of the 2012 season. A consensus All-American in 2011 with a conference record 111 receptions for 15 touchdowns and 1,292 yards, he was on the short list for the Belitnikoff and everyone's preseason All-America. He finished 2012 with 76 receptions for 11 touchdowns and 846 yards, good for second team Pac-12. It was an otherwise good year but fell far short of expectations, prompting Woods to declare early for the NFL draft. When asked how much Lee's ascent factored into his decision, [Woods said](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/31/sports/la-sp-usc-football-notes-20130101) ""Not much. I mean if the coaches wanted to keep me another year they would have probably got me the ball..."" His comments echoed fans' misgivings over Kiffin's play calling and proved to be a fitting and sad coda for what was widely believed to be the start of one of the greatest offensive
careers in USC history.

*The Greats*
***

**Greatest Games:**

* 1967 vs. #1 UCLA, ""The Game Of The Century"" - Gary Beban won the Heisman despite [one of the most famous runs in college football history](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qMzVNKp2tw) as OJ Simpson and the Trojans beat their city rivals 21-20 to gain a berth to the Rose Bowl and an eventual national championship. Simpson wins the Heisman the following year.

* 1970 vs. #16 Alabama - Trojan FB Sam ""Bam"" Cunningham ran for 135 yards and two touchdowns to lead USC past an all-white Alabama team in Birmingham. All six USC touchdowns were scored by African-American players. Bear Bryant had previously flown to LAX to briefly meet with John McKay and secure the game. The Bear knew what he wanted and the loss reportedly gave him the ammunition to speed up the full integration of his team, leading to the slightly overwrought, possibly mythical quote: [""Sam Cunningham did more to integrate Alabama in 60 minutes than Martin Luther King did in 20 years.""](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704107104574572340901355488.html)

* 1974 vs. #5 Notre Dame, [""The Comeback""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owwLrK7r9Mk) - Down 24 points to Notre Dame, Anthony ""Irish Killer"" Davis caught a touchdown pass from current AD Pat Haden with ten seconds left in the first half to make the score 24-6. Davis took the second half kickoff and raced to a touchdown, setting off a barrage of 55 unanswered points as USC defeated Notre Dame 55-24 in one of the wildest games in the history of the Coliseum. Bring up this game if you know an Irish fan older than fifty. With Traveler galloping around the track for seemingly the entire second half, [Keith Jackson commented](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/afterword/2010/02/mosi-tatupus-role-in-uscs-victory-over-notre-dame-in-1974.html): ""I'll tell you one thing that game did: It made Ara Parseghian hate all white horses.""

* 2005 vs. #9 Notre Dame, ""[The Bush Push Game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4wHN-NVcc8)"" - Billed as The Greatest Team Ever In The History Of Adverbs by ESPN, the Trojans entered South Bend faced with Charlie And The Touchdown Factory (self-dubbed) and his green jerseys. Trailing 31-28, USC was faced with a 4th-and-9 from its own 26 with 1:32 remaining. USC QB Matt Leinart audibled to WR Dwayne Jarrett for a 61-yard fade. A few plays later Leinart ran out of bounds as the time ticked off to zero and the fans stormed the field, only to be brought back as officials put seven seconds back on the clock. Carroll was shown on national television signalling for the spike as Leinart snapped the ball on a QB sneak. Made entirely of elbows and well sculpted hair, he was stopped short by the Irish defensive front only to be pushed into the endzone by Reggie Bush in what was later declared an illegal maneuver. An entire nation laughed, threw up in
their mouths a little and prepared for another week of ESPN fawning.

* 2006 Rose Bowl vs. #2 Texas - In perhaps the greatest game ever played and certainly one of the most memorable national championships, Vince Young and the Longhorns prevailed 41-38 over #1 USC in a contest that saw multiple lead changes, several controversial referee decisions and a spirit devouring 4th-and-2 defensive stand by Texas to give them an opportunity to win the game, allowing Vince Young to lope past USC's secondary with 17 seconds left. The teams entered the game as season long #1 and #2, and Young's performance is the greatest bowl game effort in the history of history. Joke's on Texas though because that game doesn't count.

**Greatest Plays**:

* OJ's 64-yard run, see above
* [Haden-to-Diggs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i99nER5cexI) - QB Pat Haden completes a two point conversion to WR Shelton Diggs to beat Ohio State 18-17 in the 1975 Rose Bowl to win a share of the national championship.
* [Antuan Simmons' between the legs interception return](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVNrgD2F3Bo) - This high steppin' SOB somehow managed to pick off UCLA's Cory Paus in the first quarter of a game USC needed to win to qualify for a bowl game in Carroll's first year. The return of the Trojans' swagger after a long and depressing absence.
* Leinart's reverse TD seals USC's first title in a quarter of a century:
* [USC scores 28 points on 8 plays for 246 yards in 1:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fWz8QAYfTw) - The epitome of the best offense in USC history, the Trojans ended its game vs.
Arkansas in the first quarter.

* RB OJ Simpson (1968 Heisman) – hey, he went crazy *long* after he left campus.  
* RB Charles White (1979 Heisman)  
* RB Marcus Allen (1981 Heisman)  
* QB Carson Palmer (2002 Heisman)  
* QB Matt Leinart (2004 Heisman)  
* RB Reggie Bush (2005 Heisman, since vacated) ಠ_ಠ

[](/heisman) **""It means he didn't fucking listen to me, Johnny. I told him: pay off that criminal asshole to shut up, but he's like 'oh, people will disrespect me' and I told him 'you idiot you're a top-3 NFL Draft Pick, ain't no one gonna care' but he was too busy shagging a Kardashian to listen to sense.""**

[](/johnny) **""Wait... I can bang a Kardashian with one of these?""**

[](/heisman) **""*Argh!* ^^^ ...just remember to wear a rubber this time, Johnny.**

* DB Ronnie Lott  
* OL Anthony Munoz  
* WR Lynn Swann  
* OL Bruce Matthews (you might have heard of his nephew, Clay)  
* DB Troy Polamalu  
* LB [Junior Seau](http://i.imgur.com/POvq4J2.jpg)  

**Greatest Coaches:**

* Howard Jones (1925–1940) – 1928, 1931, 1932 and 1939 national titles, 121–36–13 overall. Jones put USC football on the national map. The Notre Dame rivalry started under his watch as his “Thundering Herd” squads smashed through schedules. He was known for being non-nonsense, and even bland, as he lived and breathed football. He died suddenly of a heart attack at age 55—who knows what he could've accomplished had that not happened.

* John McKay (1960-1975) - 1962, 1967, 1972 and 1974 national titles, 127-40-8 overall record. Unlike Jones, McKay was witty off the field and known for his quotes. Following the 51–0 loss to Notre Dame in 1966, ""I told my team it doesn't matter. There are 750 million people in China who don't even know this game was played. The next day, a guy called me from China and asked, 'What happened, Coach?'"" Following a game in 1967 in which OJ Simpson carried 30 times, McKay was asked ""Why are you giving the ball to Simpson so often?"" He replied, ""Why not? It's not heavy, and he doesn't belong to a union.""

* Pete Carroll (2000-09) - 2003 and 2004 national titles, 97-19 overall record. Carroll was notably USC's fourth choice for the position after Mike Bellotti, Dennis Erickson, and Mike Riley all turned it down. Why? Because the pressure to succeed at moribund USC was so intense that it seemed like a no-win situation. Yet Carroll proved it could be done. His run at USC was nothing short of tremendous: the energy, passion, humor, etc. [Here is the best article ever written about his tenure.](http://www.lamag.com/features/2007/12/01/23-reasons-why-a-profile-of-pete-carroll-does) It's hard to believe Carroll or anyone thought USC was going to get hit with the sheer force the NCAA opted to use. He always had an eye on the NFL, because his life was about “win forever” and after failing twice there was no way he wasn't going to take another swipe at the The League, but more on his own terms. He has seriously beautiful hair.

*Traditions*
****

* [The Victory Sign.](http://i.imgur.com/VhTUjnc.jpg) USC fans love to give the V-symbol and pump their arms from the elbow.

* ""Fight On!"" is a battle cry among Trojans, written and spoken everywhere.

* No Names: USC players have never worn names on their jerseys. Those non alum a-holes wearing the fake #32 jerseys with ""Simpson"" on the back? We hate them too.

* Band concerts: The band plays a free concert before the game (at away games it's sometimes only allowed at the private alumni gathering). On campus it's done in front of our main auditorium and the band then leads the march to the Coliseum. After the game the band plays a post-game concert in the stadium, including opposing stadiums. If it isn't clear already, being in the USC band isn't a bad thing.

* Kicking the flagpoles: At the edge of campus, right before we cross the street to Expo Park, there are three flagpoles. [Fans kick the bases for luck as they march by.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_XtkpH_qI)

* #55: Traditionally given to only the most deserving linebacker, and sometimes not handed out at all. Famous #55s include Willie McGinest and Junior Seau.

* [SoCal Spellout] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhDKuZocShg): A raucous chant that is getting harder and harder to understand because everyone gets so excited yelling it. S-O-U-T-H-E-R-N... C-A-L-I-F-O-R-N-I-A... SouTHERN... Califoooooooornia!

* [4th quarter lighting of the torch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM--HisVw08): Before the start of the 4th quarter of every USC home game, the Olympic Torch above the Peristyle end of the Coliseum is lit. 

* Tailback U: The Trojans have been known as Tailback U after featuring five Heisman Trophy winners at the position in addition to numerous All-Americans.

*Campus and Surrounding Area*
***

**City Population:** 3,857,799 in the city limits, but they're weird and relatively small borders, the metro is 12,828,837.

[**City Skyline**](http://i.imgur.com/EeTAEqE.jpg)

**Iconic Campus Building:**

* **Bovard Auditorium** ([picture](http://i.imgur.com/CwIODDx.jpg), [website](http://www.usc.edu/student-affairs/bovardauditorium/)): This is the most iconic building on campus. Home to the school's administration and a large auditorium. It's hosted major speakers and events, including major debates. Tommy Trojan sits in front of the base. Before each football game there's a large free concert by the band before they start the march towards the Coliseum. It's been used in countless movies, but probably the one that sticks out most is Legally Blonde: normally [no one would sit like these extras were sitting in those windows (I think it was supposed to be a Harvard dorm](http://i.imgur.com/7GyHF5u.jpg)

* [**Doheny Memorial Library**](http://i.imgur.com/PLhzgS1.jpg), the main campus library is equally stately and gorgeous, particularly [the main level and reading room](http://i.imgur.com/dqQPbqK.jpg). It has stacks that go underground. It's also been used in many movies, my favorite is The Graduate, as Doheny and several other buildings were used as UC Berkeley ([here's a YouTube video of those scenes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh7H6XC11P8&amp;t=4m27s))

* [**Widney Alumni House**](http://i.imgur.com/xO3dUVf.jpg): This is the original 1880 building that started USC. [Here it is in 1903.](http://i.imgur.com/Cbson1J.jpg) It's been moved twice to different parts of campus, and now has a nice spot near the SE corner.

* **[Mudd Hall of Philosophy](http://i.imgur.com/x1R1jf2.jpg)** -- modeled after a medieval Tuscan monastery, it also has [a gorgeous library](http://i.imgur.com/pmyvqwt.png).

* The **Galen Center** is USC's basketball arena that replaced the aging Sports Arena (which was city-owned). The coolest thing about the modern facility is the [window on one end that has a view of the downtown LA skyline.](http://i.imgur.com/jknbdce.jpg)

**Local Dining:**

Where to begin, where to begin... this list will include the good options next to campus and some USC-friendly spots in LA.

* **Tommy's** ([Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Tommy's)): The original location of local chain Original Tommy's isn't near campus but is a classic among Trojans. Chili Burgers and Chili Fries. There are no seats, just tables you can stand at with plenty of paper towels. It's open 24 hours, so the original shack *has no doors or windows*. They bought the entire block so they can move work to another kitchen in the neighboring building whenever one or the other needs to be cleaned. They also bought the lots across the street for more parking. This is a place where they say you will rub elbows with everyone from politicians to prisoners... and over the years I did. If you go, order a Chili Cheese Fries, it's heaven.

* **901 Bar &amp; Grill** ([website](http://www.901bar.com/index.php)): The “Nine-O” is *the* USC neighborhood bar. Why go to th...[wha...what were we talking about?](http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/901-bar-and-grill-los-angeles?select=aBrxXlgpptyAVhvVlfL3Ow#aBrxXlgpptyAVhvVlfL3Ow)

* **Chano's** ([website](http://theoriginalchanos.com/history.html)): Right by campus, Chano's has been a go-to spot for all sorts of great, greasy Mexican food sold at the counter or drive-through. All the seating is outside.

* **Philippe's** ([Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe%27s)): Inventor of the French Dip sandwich. Popular with USC fans and Dodger fans. Again, not near campus but heavily associated. Get a French Dip, double dipped, with their home made coleslaw (request it wet). The apple pie is solid. The mustard is kick-ass strong, but good on the sandwich.

* **El Cholo** ([website](http://www.elcholo.com/asp/site/losAngeles/index.asp?Location=1)): This authentic Mexican restaurant opened in 1923 next to the Coliseum, but then moved to Western Blvd (again, a drive); but it has deep roots with USC and used to offer a discount for students on weekdays. The food and margaritas here are dynamite.

* **La Barca**: Another popular Mexican restaurant not too far from campus. Has a very popular happy hour.

* **Bacon-wrapped hot dog carts**: While Roy Choi's Kogi trucks are widely regarded as the grandfathers of the food truck revolution that has taken the falafel you never ate and turned it into the organic kimchee falafel with avocado crema you are definitely now not eating, we know the truth. Before and after every game at the Coliseum roving bands of Hispanic owned carts – literally shopping carts jury rigged with sterno cans and baking sheets serving as flat top – supply a heavily drunken populace with the sweet, poop-inducing ambroisia of the Gods: the bacon wrapped hot dog covered in onions, mayo and, if you're lucky, some kind of spice out of a nondescript can. The police shut down as many as they can but, like the American spirit glorious and free, the bacon dog cart will never die. Unless somebody gets botulism or salmonella, in which case we'll die. But not the carts.

*Random Trivia*
***

* Trojan athletes have won 287 medals at the Olympic games (135 golds, 87 silvers and 65 bronzes), more than any other university. If USC were a country, it would rank 12th in most Olympic gold medals (and that includes the Winter Games, which we barely participate in). USC led the number of medals and golds in the 2012 Olympics among schools as well.

* USC leads the total number of NFL Draft picks with 479; rival Notre Dame is a very close second

* USC has a winning record against all other members of the Pac-12.

* Female USC teams are called the Women of Troy. The two most famous are basketball greats Cheryl Miller and Lisa Leslie.

* USC has won 120 team national championships, 98 of which are NCAA National Championships. Our men's teams are the most dominant: with the highest number of men's titles of any schools and 303 individual NCAA men's titles. Of those teams, 26 championships in track and field, 19 in tennis, 12 in baseball, 9 in swimming and diving, 7 in water polo.

* USC's first All-American (1925), Brice Taylor, earned the accolades despite [not having a left hand](http://i.imgur.com/pALa3dd.jpg). He was later the head coach of the Southern from 1928 to 1931, and was instrumental in starting would become the Bayou Classic against rival Grambling.

* **[The Super Fan](http://i.imgur.com/o8ZROkV.jpg):** Although every school has their fan who has a streak of games, none anywhere come close to [Giles Pellerin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giles_Pellerin), who attended 797 consecutive USC football games home and away (including Tokyo) over a period of 73 years until his death at age 91. , He saw the Trojans go 532-225-40, win nine national championships, and play under ten different head coaches. He died in the same place he watched his first game: the Rose Bowl.

* USC has [the world's best film school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_School_of_Cinematic_Arts), established in 1929 with the MPAA. The admissions rate for the school hovers under 5%. Since 1973, at least one alumnus of the school has been nominated for an Academy Award annually, totaling 256 nominations and 78 wins. Also since 1973, at least one alum has been nominated for the Emmy Award annually, totalling 473 nominations and 119 wins. The top 17 grossing films of all time have had an SCA graduate in a key creative position. Steven Spielberg has donated a ton of money and he was denied admission twice. George Lucas donated $175m to the school in 2006, leading to a new complex that replaced the old one which was anchored by... the Lucas Building. USC student films have won the Palme d’Or and Academy Awards. The faculty is similarly well regarded.

* USC has the most International Students of any American university. USC maintains offices in Brazil, China (Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong), India, Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan.

* Famous Trojans, in addition to OJ and Reggie (and leaving out football and the film school) include: John Wayne, Frank Gehry, Will Ferrell, America Ferrera, Darryl Hannah, Tom Selleck, Forest Whittaker, Dr. Drew Pinsky, John Ridder, LeVar Burton, Dexter Holland, Mark McGrath, Marilyn Horne, Macy Gray, DeMar DeRozan, Brian Scalabrine, Tex Winter, Paul Westphal, Mark Prior, Barry Zito, Randy Johnson, Mark McGwire, Jerry Buss, Salvatore Ferragamo, 16 astronauts, two Japanese Prime Ministers, two Jordanian Prime Ministers, the current President of Egypt, a South Korean prime minister, and the guy who founded Wham-O.

*2012 Season*
***

**Record:** [8-4](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/_/id/213/penn-state-nittany-lions)
	
**Coach:** [Bill O’Brien](http://imgur.com/OYNw0MR)  

[**2012 Roster**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Penn_State_Nittany_Lions_football_team)	

**Key Players:** 

* [Michael Mauti (LB)](http://imgur.com/MsoH3TO) - Perhaps not the hero Penn State deserved, but definitely the one we needed. He was our fearless leader and the epitome of Linebacker U. 

* [Matt McGloin (QB)](http://imgur.com/SvPm5pp) - Moxie McGloin was a walk-on who sat behind Daryll Clark, Kevin Newsome, and Rob Bolden at one point in his college career. Though, in 2012, he surpassed Clark’s record for single-season yards and completions, as well as career TD passes. His progression was a testament to O’Brien’s offense and the mark of a bold new era in Penn State Football.
* [Allen Robinson (WR)](http://imgur.com/eSQ8TQ2) - Robinson was a huge surprise to many who followed the Nittany Lions in 2012. As a member of the [“Supa Six”](http://imgur.com/4Kh3gcW), his performance and dedication to carrying Penn State through the sanction-riddled years to come is setting the standard for those around him as well as those to come.  
* [Gerald Hodges (LB)](http://imgur.com/9pEqINz) - Carrying the banner with Mauti for Linebacker U, Hodges led the team in tackles. Although he was one of the more athletic defensive players on the team, Hodges short-lived stint as a punt returner was a “not-so-grand-experiment”. 
* [Jordan Hill (DT)](http://imgur.com/sZOzGX8) - Hill was responsible for filling the hole Devon Still left and he did a phenomenal job of doing so. His presence on the D-Line dictated how teams were able to run the football and drawing a double team allowed for Hodges, Mauti, and Deion Barnes to shine.
* [Sam Ficken (K)](http://imgur.com/zrfOALl) - Regardless of what Penn State fans choose to remember from last year, Ficken had an undeniable influence on our season. His 20% FG (and 50% XP) success rate against Virginia was certainly the low point of the season. However, it was this performance that gave birth to the aggressive offensive game-plans that O’Brien used to their advantage later in the year. Also, let it be known, Ficken scored the game-winning field goal in OT on Senior Day against Wisconsin- ending the year on a solid note and capping off an emotional season for the Nittany Lions.

**Biggest Plays:** 

* [**Penn State - Northwestern**: *The Entire 4th Quarter*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=U88jYnbTdRw#t=39s) Down 28-17, McGloin led the Nittany Lions down the field with the help of Zack Zwinak and Allen Robinson to bring the game to within reach. Capped off with a successful 2pt Conversion by Michael Zordich, they pulled within 3. Then with a solid stand by the defense, the ball and the game came into Penn State’s possession. Moxie McGloin’s showcase dive into the endzone with just over 2 minutes left in the game put the game in the hands of their very capable defense and Penn State’s homefield advantage. Another touchdown by Zordich put the game on ice and brought the team back to .500 on the season, allowing for a pendulum of momentum to carry them through the remaining six games. 

* ~~[**Penn State - Nebraska**: Matt Lehman’s Game-Winning Touchdown](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1716613/bangbang_medium.gif) With 6 Minutes left in the game, TE, Matt Lehman scores a touchdown just moments before the ball comes loose.~~
* [**Penn State - Wisconsin**: Sam Ficken’s Game-Winning Field Goal in OT](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=b5MWN-vpmak#t=253s) Sam Ficken was able to redeem his season by finishing 10-14 on FGs on the season, including 3 converted attempts against Wisconsin. His 37-yard game winner allowed the defense to get the win with a stop on Wisconsin’s possession.

**Greatest Games:**

* [1959: Liberty bowl: Penn State 7 - Alabama 0](http://imgur.com/fh0tfa3)

In a defensive struggle Penn State prevailed with a fake field goal thrown by Galen Hall late in the second quarter. The game is notable because it was Bear Bryant’s first bowl game as head coach of Alabama and Joe Paterno was an assistant on the sidelines.

* [1981 #1 Pitt 14 - #10 Penn State 48](http://imgur.com/CiH7iAI)

It was the last game of the regular season and the #1 ranked Dan Marino led Pittsburgh Panthers were looking forward to going to the national championship game. The Panthers pounced to an early 14 point lead before the Nittany Lions came roaring back and thumped the Panthers. Penn State would go on to win the national championship the next season.

* [1983 Sugar Bowl: #2 Penn state 27 - #1 Georgia 23.](http://imgur.com/5JBSeOO)

Curt Warner outran Herschel Walker and Penn State won its first national championship.

* [1987 Fiesta Bowl: #2 Penn State 14 - Miami 10](http://imgur.com/CpQP3oF) 

[Just read this article](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=fiesta87)

* [1995 Rose Bowl: #2 Penn State 38 - #9 Oregon 20](http://imgur.com/qZ4zOuK) 

Penn State went undefeated and did not win or play for the national championship. Many fans consider the 1994 team the best ever Penn State team.

* [2005 #16 Penn state 17 - # 6 Ohio state 10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjJ86bKIUA8)

After a dismal few years Penn State came back in an alarming fashion, beating Ohio State in front of the first ever student white out.

* [2011 #19 Penn state 10 - Illinois 7](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk9gjOJiX_0)

Joe Paterno’s last game, his 409th win and the last game before Sandusky’s atrocities became known to the general public.

**Greatest Plays:**

[Here is a highlight reel of Penn State plays from past and present.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-1tV7d9-Pc)

**Greatest Players:**

* **[Jack Ham](http://imgur.com/rEAaVBv)** - Possibly the greatest Penn State linebacker in our history. [An All-American in 1970](http://imgur.com/KSwrjlF), Jack Ham became the 10th Nittany Lion to be enshrined in the National Football Foundation College Football Hall of Fame when he was inducted in 1990. Ham is the only Penn State product in both the college and professional football halls of fame. A nine-time All-Pro linebacker for the National Football League Pittsburgh Steelers, Ham was enshrined at Canton in 1988. As a senior co-captain in 1970, Ham had 91 tackles and intercepted four passes. He still shares a pair of defensive records for blocked punts: four in his career, three in his final season. He had 251 career tackles (143 solo). A second-round draft choice of the Steelers in 1971, Ham developed into one of the NFL's most outstanding linebackers. He starred on all four of the Steelers' Super Bowl championship teams and was the Defensive Player-of-the-Year in 1975.

* **[John Cappelletti](http://imgur.com/vk069u8)** - Our only [Heisman winner](http://imgur.com/ZuPcLML) amazingly. As a senior tailback at Penn State, he gained 1,522 yards on 286 carries scoring 17 touchdowns as the Nittany Lions rolled to an undefeated season. He was awarded the 1973 Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, the UPI College Football Player of the Year, the Walter Camp Award, the Chic Harley Award, as well as receiving All-America honors. In his two-year running-back career, he gained over 100 yards in thirteen games and had a career total of 2,639 yards and twenty-nine touchdowns for an average of 120 yards per game and 5.1 yards per carry. Cappelletti's Heisman acceptance speech, where he dedicated his award to his dying brother, Joey, is one of the most memorable in the history of college sports. During Cappelletti's senior season, Penn State was scheduled to play the West Virginia Mountaineers in a late October afternoon match. The morning of the game, Cappelletti asked Joey what he wanted for his upcoming 11th birthday. Joey replied ""I want you to score three touchdowns for me. No, four."" At the end of the 1st half, Cappelletti had scored 3 touchdowns, well on his way to four. But head coach Joe Paterno did not like to run up the score against opponents, so when the game resumed after halftime, Paterno told Cappelletti he would be on the bench. Cappelletti quietly took his seat on the bench, without telling Paterno of Joey's wish. Late in the 3rd quarter, one of Cappelletti's teammates told Paterno of Joey's wish. On Penn State's next possession, Paterno shouted ""22"", and Cappelletti took the field. Cappelletti scored his 4th touchdown on the same possession, and pointed to Joey as he ran off the field.

* **[Paul Posluszny](http://imgur.com/UovRCho)** - Outside linebacker, 2005-06, selected by the Associated Press, Football Writers Association of America, The Sporting News and Walter Camp Football Foundation in 2005 and the AP and Walter Camp Football Foundation in 2006. Posluszny became just the second two-time winner of the Chuck Bednarik Award, presented to the nation's top defensive player, in 2006. In 2005, he also won the Butkus Award, presented to the nation's top linebacker and was a finalist for the `06 honor. The 13th Nittany Lion to be named a two-time first-team All-American, Posluszny also was a two-time finalist for the Rotary Lombardi Award. He was selected Big Ten Defensive Player-of-the-Week a conference-record five times in his career. The Nittany Lions' first two-time team captain since 1968-69, he became Penn State's career tackle leader with 372. A starter in the last 37 games of his career, Posluszny became the first Nittany Lion to lead the team in tackles three times and to post three 100-tackle seasons, recording 116 in 2006. Posluszny also was a two-time first-team ESPN The Magazine Academic All-American and was selected the 2006 Academic All-American-of-the-Year among Division I football players. He and Jeff Hartings (1994-95) are the only Nittany Lions to earn first-team All-America and Academic All-America honors twice. Was selected by the Buffalo Bills with the second pick of the second round in the 2007 NFL Draft. ([Plus he was tough as hell.](http://imgur.com/kra1otG))

**Greatest Coaches:**

 **[Joe Paterno.](http://imgur.com/bFGqCAp)** Joseph Vincent Paterno was born December 21, 1926, in Brooklyn, New York. He played [quarterback](http://imgur.com/qKP1rWG) and cornerback for the Brown Bears, and shares the career record for interceptions with Greg Parker at 14. Paterno graduated in 1950. Although his father asked, ""For God's sake, what did you go to college for?"" after hearing of his career choice, Paterno joined Rip Engle as an assistant coach at Penn State in 1950; Engle had coached five seasons, 1944–1949, at Brown. Engle announced his retirement in February 1966, and Paterno was named his successor.

Paterno has an official career record of 298 wins, 136 losses, and 3 ties. At the time of his death, Paterno had accumulated 409 total collegiate wins, but on July 23, 2012, NCAA rulings officially vacated 111 of Paterno's wins based on the findings of the Freeh report regarding his involvement in the Penn State sex abuse scandal. All wins dating back to 1998 were vacated, the year Paterno was first informed of Sandusky's suspected child abuse. Based on the criteria used by the NCAA, Paterno no longer holds the record for most victories by an NCAA Division I football coach. Former Florida State coach Bobby Bowden now holds the NCAA major college record for wins at 377, while for NCAA Division I schools, Grambling coach Eddie Robinson's 408 victories stands as the official record. In his 46 seasons as a head coach, Paterno had 27 winning seasons. Paterno was the only coach with the distinction of having won each of the four major bowls—Rose, Orange, Fiesta, and Sugar—as well as the Cotton Bowl Classic, at least once. Including the 2012 NCAA sanctions, Penn State won at least 3 bowl games in each of the 3 decades between 1970 and 1997. Paterno led Penn State to two national championships (1982 and 1986) and five undefeated, untied seasons (1968, 1969, 1973, 1986, and 1994). Four of his unbeaten teams (1968, 1969, 1973, and 1994) won major bowl games and were not awarded a national championship. Penn State won the Orange Bowl (1968, 1969, and 1973 (with a 2005 win vacated*)), the Cotton Bowl (1972 and 1974), the Fiesta Bowl (1977, 1980, 1981, 1986, 1991, and 1996), the Liberty Bowl (1979), the Sugar Bowl (1982), the Aloha Bowl (1983), the Holiday Bowl (1989), the Citrus Bowl (1993 (with the 2010 win vacated*)), the Rose Bowl (1994), the Outback Bowl (1995 (with the 1998 &amp; 2006 wins vacated*)) and the Alamo Bowl ( with the 1999 and the 2007 win vacated*). After Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993, the Nittany Lions under Paterno won the Big Ten one time (1994), with the NCAA stripping away the 2005 and 2008 shared championships in their July, 2012 sanctions. Paterno had 29 finishes in the Top 10 national rankings.

Paterno was a long-time advocate for some type of college football playoff system. The question was posed to him frequently over the years, as only one of his five undefeated teams was voted national champion.

After the announcement of his hiring in 1966, Paterno set out to conduct what he called a ""Grand Experiment"" in melding athletics and academics in the collegiate environment, an idea that he had learned during his years at Brown. As a result, Penn State's players have consistently demonstrated above-average academic success compared to Division 1-A schools nationwide. According to the NCAA's 2008 Graduation Rates Report, Penn State's four-year Graduation Success Rate of 78% easily exceeds the 67% Division 1 average, second to only Northwestern among Big Ten institutions. In 2011, Penn State football players had an 80% graduation rate and showed no achievement gap between its black and white players, which is extremely rare for Division I football teams. The New American Foundation ranked Penn State No. 1 in its 2011 Academic Bowl Championship Series. Paterno was also renowned for his charitable contributions to academics at Penn State. He and his wife Sue have contributed over $4 million towards various departments and colleges, including support for the Penn State All-Sports Museum, which opened in 2002, and the Pasquerilla Spiritual Center, which opened in 2003. After helping raise over $13.5 million in funds for the 1997 expansion of Pattee Library, the University named the expansion Paterno Library in their honor.

In 2009, Paterno was named to Sporting News' list of the 50 greatest coaches of all time (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL, college basketball, and college football).

**Greatest Rivalries:**

* **Those Bastards at [](/pittsburgh) Pitt:** We lead 50*-42-4 (48-42-4). Most people don’t feel too strongly either way about playing Pittsburgh but I hate them. I just want to go into Pittsburgh (which is otherwise a lovely city where all the other sports teams I root for) and whoop Pitt. Sadly, they currently have one game win streak on us. But that’ll change on September 10, 2016 at Heinz Field. We’ve had some greats on both sides and during the 1970’s/Early 1980’s this was the PREMIER rivalry in the Northeast as both teams were constantly battling for top positions in the polls. [This guy doesn't help anything, either.](http://imgur.com/HssnsHm)

* **[](/ohiostate) Ohio State:** We’re ‘tied’ 14*-14 (8-14). This is pretty much the biggest game of the year for us since we stopped playing most of our older rivals and Michigan State/Minnesota both rarely/never play us anymore. Winning this game almost always means that a good season lies ahead. This is also one of the few games that seems to almost always also be a night game so we’re usually pretty pumped when the game rolls around.

* **[](/syracuse)Syracuse:** We lead this one 42*-23-5 (40-23-5). Originally they were our biggest rival. This was the game in the Upper New York/Central Pennsylvania area. Both teams enjoyed success in the 1950’s and 1960’s which led to it starting to grow and blossom. But eventually it succumbed to a greater hatred. Which would be the hatred of Pitt.

* **Other notable rivalries:** Michigan State(14*-13-1, 5-13-1), Minnesota(8*-4, 3-4), West Virginia(48-9-2), Alabama(5-10), Maryland(35-1-1), and Notre Dame(9*-9-1, 8-9-1)

*Traditions:*

* **[Nittanyville (Formerly known as Paternoville)](http://imgur.com/BiJYgkw):** ""Nittanyville"" is the name attributed to the student tradition of camping out in front of Beaver Stadium prior to a home football game. The tradition was established during the 2005 football season, when students began setting up tents and ""camping"" in front of Beaver Stadium one week before the game with rival school Ohio State on October 8. The students camped in front of the stadium in order to hold their positions in line for front-row seats. Nittanyville was originally known as ""Paternoville,"" in honor of the head coach Joe Paterno but the name was changed in light of the Sandusky Scandal. Football players, the Blue Band, and Joe Paterno himself frequented Paternoville, pepping up the students as game day drew near. Nittanyville is governed by the student-run Nittanyville Coordination Committee. On July 16, 2012, Penn State student organizers announced that they will be renaming the ""tent city"" Nittanyville, opting to drop the reference to Joe Paterno.

* **[Linebacker U](http://imgur.com/trYK3hB):** Penn State is known for producing All-American, All-Conference, and Award winning linebackers and has gained the great nickname of “Linebacker U” due to this. Here are some of the linebackers closely associated with this (in chronological order!): Dennis Onkotz, Jack Ham, Ed O’Neil, Greg Buttle, Shane Conlan, Lavar Arrington, Cameron Wake, Tamba Hali, Paul Posluszny, Dan Connor, Sean Lee, NaVarro Bowman, Michael Mauti and Gerald Hodges.

*Campus and Surrounding Area:*

**City Population:** University Park, Pennsylvania is the campus is located but state college is the surrounding town. State College has a population of 42,034 while University Park has a population of 12,764

*Iconic Campus Buildings:*

**[Old Main](http://imgur.com/TLO1Bkd):** Our administrative building, originally built in 1863, it was deemed structurally unsound in the 20’s and rebuilt in 1930.

**[Paterno-Pattee Library](http://imgur.com/XunFnXh):** the Paterno wing of the library was funded via donations from Joe and Sue Paterno. Rumor has it there is a ghost of a murdered student that haunts the “stacks” of Pattee library.

**[The HUB/Robeson Center](http://imgur.com/CRLjJ04):** The student union building has a Chick-fil-a and houses the offices for student activities and student government.

*Local food:*

* **[The Berkey Creamery](http://imgur.com/7wSZisY)** features ice cream made by [Penn State's food science department](http://imgur.com/VmYAJ1M). It was ranked by Forbes as the best ice cream in America. Ben and Jerry learned how to make ice cream via a course offered by Penn state.

* Walk down **College ave** and its side streets and you will find lots of places to eat, shop, and drink. If you get a Monkey Boy at the Saloon you probably won’t need anything else to drink.

* **[Ye Olde College Diner](http://sites.psu.edu/goodeating/files/2012/09/The-Diner-2.jpg)** is a restaurant of dubious quality but is relatively famous for their [grilled stickies](http://cookingwiththepros.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc_0358.jpg). Go in and get one if you want, don’t stay for a full meal though.


* State Colleges local Brewpub is **[Otto’s](http://imgur.com/gulUGSh)**, which uses only local ingredients. Its awesome. Do not go on game days, it will be a long wait.


* For Breakfast go to the **[Waffleshop](http://imgur.com/eEMpiSm)**. It has good portions and prices. There are three locations in town.


* If you are planning on going to the bars: **[This website](http://www.statecollege.com/bartour/)** has all the drink deals. Go nuts.

*What Is and What is to Come*

Without a doubt, the 2012 Penn State football season was unlike any season that College Football (not just Penn State) fans have ever experienced. This was a team that had been picked apart and harassed by media and a roster that was circled, like prey, by the wolves that were opposing coaches. With a 4 year bowl ban and sanctions on the horizon, there wasn’t much happiness in Happy Valley, last Summer. 


Then Fall came. And the chills soon followed.
 
Penn State football was back and that’s what mattered-- not the media circus, not the wins, not star coaches, running backs or wide receivers-- football. [Nittany Nation was ready to rally the troops](http://imgur.com/XyG1wE6) and [support their team.](http://imgur.com/DyFY29a)


8-4 is considered by most around State College as a successful season. It was a renewal of spirit for many and the laying of solid groundwork for Bill O’Brien’s stay and that is where hope is found for the future. O’Brien’s mentality keeps Penn State solidly in every game on their schedule. As a recruiter, he’s proving to be quite formidable as well. Bringing in Elite 11 QB, [Christian Hackenberg](http://imgur.com/055y5j0), has illustrated to many around the country that O’Brien’s schemes on the field are equally matched by his ability to provide what recruits are looking for in a coach and in a program.
 

The QB competition seems to be between JuCo transfer, [Tyler Ferguson](http://imgur.com/Y5RkB0j) and the aformentioned freshman, Christian Hackenberg. Although neither has been tested in B1G competition, it’s assured that O’Brien will pick the QB that is the better decision maker and, as he’s said previously that understanding the offense is his biggest priority in a starting QB. 


The 2013 season has a few different obstacles standing in the way of greatness-- a shaky outlook on the QB, O-Line, and Linebacker positions-- though these are nothing to what last year’s team was able to overcome. With Coach O’Brien coming into his own on the sidelines and in the locker room, the staff is a testament to why many Penn State fans have high hopes for 2013.

###Program details:

**The /r/cfb Baylor Brick Fund is a GO!**

Some of use here at /r/cfb have decided it would be fun to donate towards a brick at Baylor's new stadium ([details on the program here](http://www.baylor.edu/stadiumbricks/)).

###**Ground Rules**

Before I get into anything about sending money, I think it's helpful to have the basic rules so no one is later disappointed and we can all be on the same page:

* We will not be trying to troll Baylor with the brick's message. The fact that a mix of alumni from throughout the country have donated a reddit brick is kind of unique and bizarre on its own. **By ""not trolling"" I mean no *outright insults* of Baylor. Witty messages are fine, but if it would cause Baylor to reject the tile if they figured it out, why bother with this?  I just want to avoid obvious or hidden obscene messages or insults that would get the tile rejected outright. Basically, I need to be able to credibly defend the message if it gets questioned, I'm results-oriented.**

* There won't be room to put any usernames on the brick, it will be a general message from /r/CFB --no matter what message is chosen, it will be only from /r/CFB.

* People who donate will get to have ultimate say on what we write on the brick (suggestions welcome from everyone, including non-donors).

* The base amount for donation is $10. If you want to donate more, you may. 

*  To be fair to those who donate more, in determining what the Brick's message will be, each donor will be given one vote per $10 they donate (or half-vote for $5). The message will be determined by majority of donor *votes* (50%+1). Yes, theoretically someone could just donate a ton of money and determine what we say--so long as the message isn't something that will violate the ""no-trolling"" clause and is only a message from /r/CFB. 

* The brick prices go all the way to $1250. If we go over a particular amount, but fall short of another brick, the extra funds will be donated to the whoever the majority of *donors* (not donor votes) want. 

* The funds will initially go to *my WePal account* and I will donate those funds to Baylor. I will do my damnedest to be transparent about where the funds are and how much we have. 

* There is no hard deadline at the moment, but I'll put a soft deadline as Friday, January 25. We can see where we are then.  

My hope is we can use this same model if the idea ever comes up again in the future. 

###**Payment Selection**

My goal was to find a payment service that offered the least restrictions and the lowest fees (so more of your money will go to the brick). After looking through a variety of sites (including PayPal, Indiegogo, and GoFundMe), I decided to go with WePay. WePay offers the least restrictions (e.g. we don't have to meet a set goal), and low rates if we either set up a donation buttons *ourselves on our own website* OR *invoicing*. Since I don't have a website ready to go, I am going to do the invoicing option. 

###**How to Donate**

If you want to donate to our **/r/cfb Baylor Brick Fund** please use the following steps:

* [**Send me a Reddit message**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Honestly_) with (1) the amount you want to donate and (2) your preferred email address (you could post it here, but I don't recommend it as I might miss it and it will throw your email to the wolves)

* I will use WePay to invoice you at the email for that amount, which you can pay with either credit card or bank account payment. WePal's fee is 2.9% + 30¢ for credit card payments or 1.0% + 30¢ for bank account payments, so if you pay via bank account we will get more of your donation. 

* I will update this post with the usernames/flair of those who've successfully donated, along with the amount they donated. I will respect requests for anonymity on username, but I will list anonymous dollar-amounts as well so everyone knows where we are in total amount. 

* Finally, I'll do my best to keep the list of donors and amounts updated at least once a day, but please be patient. I don't foresee any hang-ups, but I should say that. If you don't see yourself listed after paying, or you have other concerns, please contact me and I will do my best to keep you in the loop.

I'm happy to answer questions below.

BCS DECLARES GERMANY WINNER OF WORLD WAR II… US Finishes Ranked 4th

After determining the Big-12 championship game participants the BCS computers were put to work on other major contests and today the BCS declared Germany to be the winner of World War II.

“Germany put together an incredible number of victories beginning with the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland and continuing on into conference play with defeats of Poland, France, Norway, Sweden, Denmark,Belgium and the Netherlands. Their only losses came against the US and Russia; however considering their entire body of work–including an incredibly tough Strength of Schedule–our computers deemed them worthy of the #1 ranking.”

Questioned about the #4 ranking of the United States the BCS commissioner stated “The US only had two major victories–Japan and Germany. The computer models, unlike humans, aren’t influenced by head-to-head contests–they consider each contest to be only a single, equally-weighted event.”

German Chancellor Adolph Hitler said “Yes, we lost to the US; but we defeated #2 ranked France in only 6 weeks.” Herr Hitler has been criticized for seeking dramatic victories to earn ’style points’ to enhance Germany’s rankings. Hitler protested “Our contest with Poland was in doubt until the final day and the conditions in Norway were incredibly challenging and demanded the application of additional
forces.”

The French ranking has also come under scrutiny. The BCS commented “France had a single loss against Germany and following a preseason #1 ranking they only fell to #2.”

Japan was ranked #3 with victories including Manchuria, Borneo and the Philippines.",,False,self,t5_2qm9d,False,,ohiostate,True,t3_no692,http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/no692/bcs_declares_germany_winner_of_world_war_ii_us/,

The driver has his windows open and is talking to two, rather large, males who I can only assume play on the football team. Me, being the nice Southerner I am, decide not to make a big deal about it. Maybe he's someone new around here, lost and asking for directions. But what should've been a quick stop and chat is now getting longer, seconds are turning into minutes...cars are stopped behind me, wondering what could compel this man to stop in the middle of a busy street. I tell ya we were moving slower than a B1G offense on a Saturday.



Finally the other lane clears up and I am able to pass the car that's worth more than my annual income. I decide instead of making a scene I will shoot him the evil eye. Strike pure fear in the heart of this man. I'm staring him down as I pass him, he turns his head, we lock eyes....its Bob Stoops. 


Normally I would get intimidated by such a thing. But not today. No, I think of all the disappointment, the slide of the sooners in recent years, and I'm angry, the man who couldn't stop a pop warner offense managed to hold up traffic in the middle of the day. 


As we lock eyes my stare only become more frightening. Boys let me tell you, the look on Stoops' face. Ive seen it before. Its the same look he had when Tevon Austin ran for his fourth TD, when Ian Johnson took the Statue of Liberty hand off. The look of fear, the look of helplessness, a look saying ""oh God, what have I done."" I decide to spare the man and continue my journey, but he and I both know I have unfinished business.



TL:DR Apparently Stoops thinks its alright to stop in the middle of traffic to talk to a football player.

**Rivals**

*Alabama-*

 (The Third Saturday in October) This is the biggest rivalry Tennessee has from a historical perspective. Since 1901, the two schools have played each other 94 times, with the series standings currently sitting at  49-38-7 in Alabama’s favor. This rivalry is notable for its streakiness;  From ’71-’81, Bama won 11 in a row, with UT winning 4 straight before and after this streak. Then, Bama won 9 in a row from ’86-’94. From ’95-’01, UT won seven in a row, and Bama has won the last six. This is Tennessee’s longest standing rivalry, and has been played every year since 1928. And, of course, you can’t talk about The Third Saturday in October without including [this video]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt2BAfhUHX0).

*Florida-*

If Alabama is Tennessee’s oldest rival, then Florida is probably Tennessee’s most hated. Beginning in 1992 when the SEC split into two divisions, the Vols and Gators battled for the East division constantly for the next decade, with the winner of the UF-UT game winning the East Division eight out of ten years. This decade long fight pitted Steve Spurrier and Phillip Fulmer against each other, both on and off the field, leading to a pretty fierce hatred for Spurrier in Vol Nation. Florida leads this all time series 23-19. 

*Kentucky-*(formerly the [Battle for the Beer Barrel](http://imgur.com/hg18WUz)) 

Not a whole lot to say about this game, but it’s worth mentioning why the game is no longer called The Battle for the Beer Barrel. A 1998 alcohol-related crash involving two UK football players prompted the end of the barrel exchange. UK athletic director expressed the idea that the ongoing use of an alcohol container would be inappropriate under the circumstances. Tennessee agreed and the tradition was discontinued before the 1999 meeting. Tennessee leads series 75-24-9.

*Vanderbilt-*

The UT-Vandy rivalry, for a long time, could hardly be considered a rivalry. In the early 20th century, Vanderbilt was absolutely dominant, winning 19 of the first 23 matchups. Then, after the hiring of Robert Neyland in 1926, the rivalry turned in favor of the Vols, and from 1927 until Neyland’s retirement in 1952, the Vols won 19 of 24 meetings. In recent years, the rivalry has become more competitive, with the hiring of James Franklin by the Commodores and the troubles the Vols have had. Overall, the Vols lead the series with a record of 73-29-5.

**THE GREATS:**

**Greatest Games:**

[1986 Sugar Bowl vs Miami](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1GxwqZ00iU) – Most of you have seen ESPN 30 for 30’s “The U”, right? Well, what you didn’t see in that documentary was the 1986 Sugar Bowl game that Miami played versus Tennessee. Miami’s players and Coach Jimmy Johnson had spent the entire week leading up to the game disrespecting Tennessee, but the Vols annihilated the Canes, sacking Vinny Testaverde 7 times for losses totaling 84 yards en route to a 35-7 victory.

[The Miracle At South Bend](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOXrjUGBIIM) – Down 31-7 just before halftime in South Bend versus the #5 Fighting Irish, the Vols stormed back to win the game 35-34 on a kick blocked by Jeremy Lincoln in the final seconds.

[“The Day the Cannon Didn’t Fire”](http://blogs.knoxnews.com/mattingly/2007/11/the-day-the-cannon-didnt-fire.html) – Coming into Knoxville ranked #1, the undefeated, defending National Champion LSU Tigers, led by their 1959 Heisman winner-to-be Billy Cannon and Chinese Bandit defense, were flying high after beating rival Ole Miss in the famous Halloween game the week before. Anticipation for the game was high and Vol fans had lined up at the [L&amp;N rail station](http://imgur.com/PDbTcoz) to watch the Champion Tigers come into town, especially Cannon who had obtained celebrity status amongst southern football fans. The game was decided shortly after LSU had cut the Vol’s lead to 14-13 with an early 4th quarter touchdown. After the touchdown, LSU’s Coach Dietzel decided to go for 2 with a play that had worked well for LSU, the pitch right to Cannon. Tennessee [stuffed Cannon at the Northeast endzone’s goal line](http://imgur.com/P7hP6jv) in what has gone down in Tennessee lore as simply “The Stop”.

**Greatest Plays:**

[No-sir-ee, No-sir-ee…pandemonioum reigns!](http://youtu.be/-MJJF9_31hU?t=4m29s) 1998 Tennessee versus Florida –107,653 had gathered in Neyland Stadium on what was a hot September evening in 1998 to see the game that had decided the SEC East winner every year since the league to divisional play. The hatred that had been building up for Florida in the previous 5 consecutive losses was immense and Steve Spurrier had added fuel to the fire with his constant barbs about Fulmer, Citrus Bowls, and [Manning](http://imgur.com/bxBOluQ). Needless to say that at the conclusion of overtime, 5 years of stress had been lifted off the shoulders of [players, coaches and fans]( http://i.imgur.com/VJ4Dmli) everywhere. This, along with others in the greatest plays list, could have also gone on the greatest game lists as well, but I wanted to spread the love.

**Greatest Players:**

[Peyton Manning ](http://imgur.com/1czkWmx)– Everyone knows who Peyton is. Fuck Charles Woodson and fuck Michigan.
[Doug Atkins](http://imgur.com/4VKnGbf) – Selected to the All-Time SEC Team (1933-82), Doug Atkins was a terrifying individual, especially at 6’8” in 50’s and 60’s. In fact, he was such a terrifying individual, [Johnny Unitas and Bears teammate Dick Butkus said Doug was the only player they were afraid of](http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-22/sports/sp-22934_1_doug-atkins). He is in the NFL and College football Hall of Fames.
[Johnny Majors](http://imgur.com/5hig96A) – Johnny was two-time SEC Player of the Year in ’55-’56 and finished second in the 1956 Heisman voting to Notre Dame’s Paul Hornung, despite the fact that the Fighting Irish went 2-8 that year.
[Reggie White “The Minister of Defense”](http://imgur.com/6wtTiTh) – Reggie was an All-American at UT and holds the school record for 32 sacks. He also retired from the NFL as the all-time sacks leader with 198, was selected to the first team All-Pro 10 times and is arguably the greatest defensive end in NFL history.
[George “Bad News” Cafego](http://imgur.com/LpWBKII) – All-American &amp; All-SEC in ’38-’39, SEC P.O.Y ’38, 4th in ’39 Heisman race, College Football HOF ’69 and number 1 overall pick in the 1940 NFL Draft.
[Hank “Mr. Everything” Lauricella](http://imgur.com/4syPXgW) – The tailback of the successful 1950 and 1951 championship teams, Hank was voted All-SEC in ’50-’51 and All-American in 1951. Hank was also the first of many Vols to finish runner-up in the Heisman race.
[Bobby Dodd](http://imgur.com/4fph2nH) – One of the few men to ever be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as both a player (1959) and as a coach (1993). Although he was beloved as a player at Tennessee, he had philosophical differences with Robert Neyland on how a team should be coached and spurned the General’s offer to become an assistant once his playing days concluded. Dodd went on to some have some mild coaching success at some school further South…
[Eric Berry](http://imgur.com/UW6j82B) – Simply put, he is the greatest safety in school history. A consensus All-American both his sophomore and junior seasons, along with being a Thorpe Award winner, Eric set school and SEC records for interception return yards in a season and a career.

[Al Wilson](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view/926256/tennessee-vols-al-wilson-o.gif)- On the Tennessee defenses of the late 1990’s, no one player stood out more than Mr. Al Wilson. He was the anchor of the 1998 National Championship team, and will forever be remembered by UT fans for his crushing hits and leadership that year.

**Greatest Coaches:**-

[The General, Robert Neyland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Neyland)- General Robert Neyland began his coaching tenure at the University of Tennessee in 1926, with the explicit instructions to “Beat Vanderbilt.” In Neyland’s first few years, Tennessee began to become a fearsome opponent, winning SoCon titles (contested) in 1927 and 1932, with undefeated seasons in ’27, ’28, ’29, ’31, and ’32. From 1926-1934 Neyland led the Vols to a record of 76-7-5. In 1934, Neyland was called into military service, and the Vols struggled, going 4-5 in 1935. In 1936 Neyland returned and, from 1938-1940, led Tennessee on one of the most dominant stretches in CFB history, going 31-2, scoring 839 points and allowing only 75 over that stretch. In 1941 Neyland left to fight in WWII, and his successor, John Barnhill, led the Vols to a 32-5-2 record from ’41-’45. In 1945, General Neyland returned for his last tenure at the University. His teams went a combined 54-17-4 in his last years (1946-52), winning National Championships in 1950-51. The teams the General Neyland led went 173-31-12 over 21 years. They won four national championships and seven conference championships (2 SoCon, 5 SEC). Neyland is also famous for having coached the last team to go an entire regular season without being scored upon, in 1939.

[Johnny Majors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Majors)-  After having been an All American at UT in the fifties, Majors took over as the head coach of the Volunteers in 1977. In his years as coach, he had a good deal of success, winning three SEC championships. Majors had a record of 116-62-8 while at Tennessee.

[Phillip Fulmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Fulmer)- In 1992, Fulmer took the reins from Majors and went on to build one of the major powerhouses of the 1990’s, going 72-14 from 1993-99. Under Fulmer, the Vols won SEC championships in 1997 and 1998, and won their first national title since the ‘50s in 1998 behind the arm of Tee Martin and a dominant defense led by Al Wilson.

**Local Dining:**

For steaks, go to [Ye Old Steak House](http://www.yeoldesteakhouse.com/). Best steakhouse in Knoxville and any SEC fan should appreciate that Bear Bryant would always have a private room reserved at here when the Tide would come to Knoxville.
For burgers or desserts, go to [Litton’s Market](http://littonsburgers.com/).

For beer only, go to Suttrees High Gravity Tavern and for beer and burgers, go to Downtown Grill and Brewery.

For some amazing barbecue and southern hospitality, head over to Calhoun’s on the River.

Other great places in the area include The Copper Cellar, Gus’ Goodtimes Deli, and The Bistro at the Bijou.

**Random Trivia:**

Tennessee acquired its name ""The Volunteer State"" in the early days of the nineteenth century in the War of 1812. At the request of President James Madison, Gen. Andrew Jackson, later President, mustered 1500 from his home state to fight the Indians and later the British at the Battle of New Orleans. The men never actually fought in battle and Jackson was so frustrated by the inactivity that he marched the men home at his own expense and his determined stance on their behalf earned him the nickname ""Old Hickory."" The name became even more prominent in the Mexican War when Gov. Aaron V. Brown issued a call for 2800 men to battle Santa Ana and some 30,000 Tennesseans volunteered.
 

Steve Spurrier, an East Tennessee native, would have potentially come to Tennessee had General Neyland, as Athletic Director, not been so reluctant to let Bowden Wyatt and his other predecessors abandon the Single Wing offense.

Despite its historical success on the field (8th all-time in wins), Tennessee is the only team in the top 14 winningest FBS programs to have never produced a Heisman winner. Hank Lauricella, Johnny Majors, Heath Shuler, and Peyton Manning were all runner-ups for the award.

The iconic checkerboard endzones were first introduced in the ’60 when Doug Dickey was head coach; they are a representation of the checkerboard pattern on the top of Ayers Hall, which at the time could be seen from the field, past the endzone. 

Smokey became the mascot in the early ‘50s after a vote by the student body; the bluetick hound won in a landslide.

Rocky Top is not UT’s actual fight song; that’s [Down the Field](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5FUv0RLrj8).


**What Is and What Is to Come:**

Looking at the schedule, early speculation leaves us with a 5-7 worst case scenario, an 8 win regular season best case scenario, and realistically somewhere in between actually happening. On offense, despite losing most the skill players in what was possibly the greatest offense in school history, Tennessee returns 6 out of 7 major contributors along the offensive line, as well as all of the running backs and some quality slot receiver back-ups from last year. Early reports out of spring practice have Justin Worley as the starter at QB, but his battle with redshirt freshman Nathan Peterman probably won’t be completely settled until fall camp.
On defense, the good news is that it cannot get any worse given that [Buddy Hackett](http://imgur.com/0MvJsE3) look-a-like and former Tennessee defensive coordinator [Sal Sunseri](http://imgur.com/2ItJ9Rs) has taken his crappy brand of defense, the worst in school history since the [students coached the team prior to the Spanish-American War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1893_Tennessee_Volunteers_football_team), to Florida State. Tennessee will still be faced with having speed that is deficient relative to UF, Oregon, UGA, Bama, etc., but being in good position and actually being coached in the fundamentals should give Tennessee’s defense an actual prayer, which they didn’t have last year.
Since Butch Jones arrival, Tennessee has been performing [very well in recruiting](http://247sports.com/Season/2014-Football/TeamRankings) for the upcoming class and there is an air of enthusiasm around the program that hasn’t been here in a long time.

**Year Founded:** 1923

* [Raider Red](http://i.imgur.com/VMoahEz.jpg) - Raider Red originated following Southwest Conference rules that allowed home teams to prohibit live mascots. The character was created based upon a comic character drawn by long-time Lubbock resident and mayor [Dirk West](http://i.imgur.com/XEjjl3l.jpg). Dirk West is also responsible for the original Nebraska Husker. Raider Red won National Mascot of the Year in 2012.

**Stadium:** [Jones ATT Stadium](http://i.imgur.com/If9nJgp.jpg) **Capacity:** 60,862

* Named after Texas Tech's first President Clifford Jones, the stadium has a gorgeous [Spanish Renaissance facade](http://i.imgur.com/n2caeBl.jpg) on the west side, a recently completed east side facade, and a giant and iconic Double T [scoreboard](http://i.imgur.com/L5SCMv6.jpg) resides in the south endzone. More than $100 million in additions and upgrades have been completed in the last decade, and even more renovations are now underway. 

    A [50+ foot high colonnade](http://i.imgur.com/VEGq67u.png), [massive](http://i.imgur.com/HaB7BvK.jpg) [HD video board](http://i.imgur.com/EEAzt4R.jpg), and additional seats are being constructed in the north end zone. The video board will be the ~8th largest HD screen and the 17th largest nationally in purely NCAA stadiums. 

	Even more extensive renovations are in the works following this season, with proposals hinting at an additional club area in the north endzone as well as a long-term goal of replacing the south endzone athletic offices with something Alamo-esque like [this](http://i.imgur.com/APCi0a8.jpg). Throughout the concourses, many [mosaics](http://imgur.com/a/8XBIJ) depict prominent Texas Tech athletes and moments.

	Initially [built in 1947](http://i.imgur.com/VZXHrSj.jpg), the stadium was greatly expanded in 1959 following Tech's admittance into the Southwest Conference. In order to facilitate said expansion, the entire east side stands were placed on railroad tracks and [slid](http://i.imgur.com/p99sL34.jpg) [back](http://i.imgur.com/8odlTPT.jpg) into place. 

    As part of that initial expansion effort, the stadium playing surface was lowered to 30 feet below street level, creating a design that serves to trap sound within the stadium. Combined with a lower bowl filled with 12,000 rowdy and fanatical students, both serve to create one of the hardest places for opposing teams to play in CFB.
     
**Stadium Location:** [On campus](http://i.imgur.com/lq4cmOT.jpg), [2](http://i.imgur.com/gS2fFaZ.jpg), sometimes in an [apocalyptic dust storm](http://i.imgur.com/tFoxMgM.jpg). Recent completion of a freeway bordering the north of the stadium results in very good and timely traffic flow on gamedays. 
     
**Conference Champions**:

* Border Conference (9) - 1937, 1942, 1948, 1949, 1951, 1953, 1954, 1955
* SWC (2) - 1976, 1994
* Big 12 South Division - 2008
     
**Number of Bowl Games:** 

* 13 wins, 34 appearances (tied with Ole Miss, Miami, and Clemson for 20th nationally in bowl appearances) 

* Texas Tech fans have set attendance records at 10 bowl games. However, only two records remain unbroken - the 2004 Holiday Bowl and the 2009 Cotton Bowl.
     
**National Titles** (1): 2014 (I want to believe)

*Rivals*
***

* [](/texas) *Texas* - Though many Texas fans do not consider us a rival, they are universally considered so by Tech fans. The teams first met in 1928, and Texas currently holds the series lead at 47-15. A trophy known as the [Chancellor's Spurs](http://i.imgur.com/Id2m0g3.jpg) was created in 1996 and now serves as a travelling award for the winner of the yearly contest. The rivalry has generated some of the best games in college football. This years matchup is set to be on Thanksgiving in prime time and will be one of the first offerings of ESPN competitor Fox Sports 1. [Wikipedia: Texas–Texas Tech football rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas%E2%80%93Texas_Tech_football_rivalry)

* [](/texasam) *Texas A&amp;M* - Though suspended by the Aggies move to the SEC, the heated rivalry between the schools first began with a meeting in 1927 and ran continously from 1957 to 2011. The Aggies currently lead the series 37-32, though Tech holds a record of 10-6 against them during their stay in the Big 12. The rivalry has been very hot blooded historically, featuring vandalism, horse theft, and goalpost shenanigans. [Wikipedia: Texas A&amp;M–Texas Tech football rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A%26M%E2%80%93Texas_Tech_football_rivalry)
     
* [](/tcu) *TCU* - Mostly a historical SWC rivalry that has now been revived with TCU's membership in the Big 12, Tech leads 29-18 in a series that has generated some lopsided scores with a 63-7 win in 1985 and a 70-35 win in 2004. The most recent meeting was a heart attack inducing 3OT affair that generated 3 of Sportscenters [Top 10 Plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKXn0lYUVU0). The series used to be named the West Texas Championship and had an accompanying trophy, but both have faded. This years meeting will be Kingsbury's first conference game. The game is on Thursday night, September 12th. [Wikipedia: TCU–Texas Tech football rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCU%E2%80%93Texas_Tech_football_rivalry)
     
* [](/baylor) *Baylor* - A majority of Tech fans don't consider it to be much of a rivalry, but we including it for the sake of completeness. Texas Tech leads the series 36-34. Since the formation of the Big 12 in 1996, Baylor has won 2 games out of 17.

*The Greats*    
****
**Greatest Games:**
     
* [2008 v. #1 Texas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqmlVLUBvbw) - Two undefeated rivals with NC hopes met late in the season with Tech at #8 and Texas at #1. For the first time in school history, College Gameday was in Lubbock and lead an absolute circus of a week. Lee Corso picks Tech to win, and we enter into a blackout night game live on national television in what was the rowdiest stadium in the country that night. Tech wore all black uniforms, contrasting starkly with the white uniforms of the hated Texas Longhorns.
    Tech opened the game by generating a safety on the first play. Tech lead for most of the game, but Colt McCoy dragged them back over us only for them to be put in the ground with one of the best drives in history.
     
* [2011 v. #3 OU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVU5oM-S6ho) - Unranked Tech comes into Norman to face a #1 OU team with a 39 home game winning streak as 28 point underdogs and defeats them.
     
* [2002 v. #3 Texas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n-_RccImfU) - A [young Kliff Kingsbury](http://i.imgur.com/6WT9GNm.jpg) upsets #3 UT in his last home game as a player

* [Billy Taylor torpedoes over the Texas defensive line on 4th and goal](https://i.minus.com/iCdEVcH0kRFoG.gif) in 1976. Taylor's acrobatics earned him the winning touchdown over Darrell Royal's 15th ranked Longhorns. Tech would go on to finish the regular '76 season 10-1 and shared the SWC championship with Houston.

* [Rodney Allison](https://i.minus.com/ibbjFLk2vqJOdN.gif) scrambles on third and long and gets a first down, keeping the drive alive for Billy Taylor's aerial display above. Allison was the greatest quarterback prior to the Mike Leach era.

* [Wes Welker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Welker) - Holds NCAA records for most punts returned in a season, most career yards on punt returns, and most career touchdowns scored on punt returns. Greatest return man in school history, as well as being a great receiver. Welker won the 2003 Mosi Tatupu Award given to the best special teams player in the country, and was named to the Sports Illustrated All-Decade team as a punt returner.
     
* [Kliff Kingsbury](http://i.imgur.com/VePEOZr.jpg) - Second greatest QB in school history. He held 39 school records, 13 Big 12 records, and 7 NCAA records at the time of his graduation. Kingsbury won the 2002 Sammy Baugh Trophy and graduated as an All-American and AP Offensive Player of the Year, as well as Academic All-American honors. He finished 9th in 2002 Heisman Trophy voting

* Zach Thomas - 2x SWC Defensive Player of the Year, 7x Pro Bowler
     
**Greatest Coaches:** 

* [Mike Leach](http://i.imgur.com/vDZwEy0.jpg) - Took over the Texas Tech program in 2000 and lead us to a winning season in every year of his tenure and several of the most prolific passing offenses that the game has ever seen. The cult of personality around him and hugely increased excitement and interest drove extreme levels of growth in the football program. During Leach's tenure, three of his quarterbacks won the Sammy Baugh Trophy.

*Traditions*
****
* [The Masked Rider leads the team onto the field in one of the best and most celebrated entrances in CFB.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KLmj543NPk&amp;) The tradition originated in 1936 after student George Tate borrowed a horse from the Tech agricultural barn as a prank and lead the team onto the field. It did not resurface until the 1953 Gator Bowl, in which a 10-1 Red Raider team was lead officially onto the field by the mascot. 

    Ed Danforth, a writer for the Atlanta Journal and a press box spectator later wrote, ""No team in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance."" The Masked Rider was the first mounted mascot in the country, and predates USC's Traveller and FSU's Renegade.

    The charge is commemorated in [statue](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fb/MRstatue.jpg) [form](http://i.imgur.com/UE1QxPd.jpg) outside the stadium. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcW7Up7nIaU) is another video from field level demonstrating the absolute wall of noise generated by the tradition and the field's location below street level. 

    Following touchdowns, the mascot used to do a full circuit gallop around the field, though this had to be stopped after an SMU cheerleader and later a referee were trampled. The Masked Rider has also exhibited [impressive](http://i.imgur.com/g9sb2Ls.jpg) feats of horsemanship. Here's a bonus video of [The Running of the Masked Rider from field level](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcW7Up7nIaU)
    

* Following victories, the 77 year-old [Victory Bells](http://i.imgur.com/Nz8tn5u.jpg) in the Administration building are [rung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CclHUp-HUFo) for 30 minutes. The 30 minute time limit was added after a 1937 victory over TCU caused the bells to ring all night, keeping many Lubbock residents awake. The ringing served as inspiration for the Texas Tech tribute [Victory Bells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imfdZ2KlHVY) by the Josh Abbott Band.
     
* The most prominent sculpture out of the many on campus is a [statue](http://i.imgur.com/7XU2Qwg.jpg) of Will Rogers on his horse Soapsuds. The statue is [wrapped](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/W%26SS.jpg) in red crepe paper on every gameday. Campus legend holds that the statue's ass was rotated precisely 23 degrees to face towards College Station. The tradition of wrapping arose after the statue was [vandalized](http://i.imgur.com/OunUZe7.png) by Aggies in the late 60s.
     
* Bangin' Bertha - A bell mounted on a trailer that is rung vigorously and sensually to produce fantastic [images](http://imgur.com/X1dXQ). The bell was designed in 1959 and was donated by the Santa Fe Railroad.
     
* [Matador Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuJD64vlk8A) - Alma mater sung before every game, and after every game. It's an homage to the team's original mascot of a Matador. Everyone stands and holds their guns up. It's taken only a little less seriously than the National Anthem. [Another video with better audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ITDPpf-0a-s#t=362s)
     
* [Guns Up](http://i.imgur.com/UpSseiL.jpg) - Tech's [pistol hand sign](http://i.imgur.com/AjurGm5.jpg). Originated in 1971 upon entry to the SWC, as all SWC schools had a hand sign.
     
* [Goin' Band from Raiderland](http://i.imgur.com/a2JxfZL.jpg) - The 400+ member band was established in 1925 and is an important part of game day activities, providing the fight song and other chant triggers. They use a mix of both traditional and corps style marching. The band won the Sudler Trophy - awarded to the best band in the country - in 1999 (before the vaunted A&amp;M Corps of Cadets). The trophy is not allowed to be given multiple times to the same team. The band was the first college band to travel to an away game and was the first band to have it's half-time show broadcast via radio. They were also one of the first bands to play and popularize Seitz's *March Grandioso* in the college setting. Here's an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIMdBOzpu0) show from a matchup with Ohio State.

* Tortillas - On kickoff and other occassions, students toss flour tortillas into the air. The tradition originated after a sports commentator denigrated Lubbock as having nothing but a tortilla factory. Tortillas are considered contraband and thus must be smuggled into the stadium, and frequently are.

* [Carol of Lights](http://i.imgur.com/c132fST.jpg) - Starting in 1959, to celebrate the holiday season Texas Tech holds an annual event called the Carol of Lights. The event starts off with the Texas Tech University Combined Choirs performing selections of classic holiday songs at the Science Quadrangle. When the lighting ceremony commences, Students as well as those who came for the show stand in awe as over 25,000 red, white, and orange lights illuminate the 13 buildings surrounding memorial circle. Over 20,000 attendees gather to sing carols and drink hot chocolate.

**City Population:** 233,740  
[**City Skyline**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/RedRaiderLubbock.jpg/800px-RedRaiderLubbock.jpg)

* Lubbock is the stereotypical college town, with much of the community activities involving the university. Lubbock is also something of a hub city, and serves all of the small farming communities around it. The nearest other city with a population of more than 10k is 2 hours away, and 10 percent of the world's cotton supply is grown within a ~100 mile radius of Lubbock. 

* Lubbock was the birthplace of Buddy Holly and thus contains the [Buddy Holly](http://i.imgur.com/c136HwM.jpg) [Museum](http://i.imgur.com/xWTboND.jpg) which [Paul McCartney](http://i.imgur.com/UYP2LAn.jpg) visits on occassion.

* Weather wise, Lubbock has hot to moderate [springs](http://i.imgur.com/sCJbHfU.jpg) and summers, and mild to [moderate](http://i.imgur.com/gEuSpy1.jpg) winters. A historically bad drought has gripped the region for several years an dhas lead to a resurgence of occassional dust storms.

* Also contained within the city is the the [National Ranching Heritage Center](http://i.imgur.com/YGOZTiw.jpg), a museum dedicated to ranching; the [Lubbock Lake Landmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubbock_Lake_Landmark), a nationally recognized archeological site; the [American Wind Power Center](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Windmills_at_American_Wind_Power_Center_in_Lubbock,_TX_IMG_0220.JPG), museum dedicated to wind and contains the largest collection of windmills nationally; and several others. 

**Iconic Campus Buildings:**
     
* [Administration Building](http://i.imgur.com/JiPKAxf.jpg), [at Christmas](http://i.imgur.com/pCSWQKY.jpg), and in an [apocalyptic dust storm](http://i.imgur.com/SVEZvLf.jpg) - Oldest building on campus and established the mostly consistent Spanish Renaissance architectural style seen in most campus buildings.
* [Chemistry Building](http://i.imgur.com/RRw8Anz.jpg) - Features the most [elaborate](http://i.imgur.com/6Wkk4fa.jpg) [architecture](http://i.imgur.com/4BlWE9Y.jpg) on campus
* [English and Philosophy Building](http://i.imgur.com/RlnxJqP.jpg)
* [Memorial Circle](http://i.imgur.com/ICulNLo.jpg) -  Located at the [main entrance](http://i.imgur.com/hjn7aHo.jpg) of the campus, [Memorial Circle](http://i.imgur.com/vt1cFQD.jpg) was dedicated to WWII veterans in 1948. It has been extended to be a memorial for current students who have lost their lives. These students are honored with the lowering of the Texas Tech flag to half-staff. The dean of students then sends the flag, along with flowers, to the student’s parents in remembrance. In addition, these students are honored at the Techsan Memorial, held every fall during homecoming week.
* [United Spirit Arena](http://i.imgur.com/12DmabJ.jpg)
* [Aerial shot](http://i.imgur.com/PNmLRCs.jpg) of half of the campus and [Google Maps](http://i.imgur.com/tx1uCBs.jpg) view.
* The campus has a [public art](http://imgur.com/a/2LQPQ) [collection](http://i.imgur.com/nrdb1id.jpg) rated in the top ten in the country.
* All of the original buildings on campus are in the National Register of Historic Places 
     
**Local Dining:**
     
* Spanky's - Best American food in town
     
* Chimy's - Best Margarita in town,
     
* Orlando's - Great Italian food with a burger rated in the top 10 in the state by Texas Monthly

* The Roof - Bar on top of the parking garage next to the stadium. Pretty neat [view](http://i.imgur.com/7wdc2xq.jpg).

* Tons of other great local restaurants that I can't immediately review because I've never partaken



***
*Random Trivia*
***

* The Sept. 18, 1965, Texas Tech game against Kansas - a 26-7 Tech win - was the first intercollegiate football contest to use instant video replay. Robert Walker, a Texas Tech alumnus, pioneered the equipment used by coach JT King to review plays immediately. However, the new twist was eliminated by the NCAA in 1967 because the technology was too costly for some schools.
     
* The campus is tremendously large and it can take 30 minutes of walking to get from a parking lot to the building your class is in.

* The campus has been called 'the most beautiful campus west of the Mississippi until you get to Stanford' by Pulitzer Prize winning author James A. Michener. Steward Mandel agreed.
     
* The ""father of the national letter of intent,"" Dr. J. William Davis was chairman of Texas Tech's Athletic Council.

* The Class of 1938 donated a [large](http://i.imgur.com/2Xa2WbA.jpg)) neon Double T sign that currently hangs on the stadium facade. The sign was reportedly the largest neon sign in existence at the time.

* Many fans believe that a lack of an indoor practice facility combined with the excessive winds of West Texas generate a significant homefield advantage for Texas Tech quarterbacks. As they practice frequently in the wind and opposing teams do not, Tech QBs have been known to throw 400+ yards with high completion percentages even in 30+MPH gusts. 

* Texas Tech is, perhaps fittingly, the leading wind research institution in the country and offers the only PhD in Wind Energy nationwide. Additionally, Tech was responsible for developing the Enhanced Fujita scale used to rate tornado strength. The Wind Science and Engineering Research Center was founded after a devastating F5 tornado swept through downtown Lubbock in 1970, causing more than $1.4 billion in damage and 26 deaths. The tornado is also responsible for the relative lack of large trees and greenery in central Lubbock, and the [Metro Life building](http://i.imgur.com/8sbF68F.jpg) downtown is the second tallest building that has survived a hit from an F5 tornado.

* Since Kliff Kingsbury's first season as a starting quarterback in 2000, Texas Tech has had more 400+ yard passing games than any team in the country with 70. Hawaii is second with 54.

* Texas Tech is the only team to ever have 5 or more players with at least 60 catches in a single season. In 2003: Wes Welker (97), Mickey Peterson (78), Taurean Henderson (78), Nehemiah Glover (77) and Carlos Francis (75)

* Texas Tech was involved in one of the strangest games in college football history. A 0-0 tie with Centenary in 1939 was played in a driving rainstorm and featured an NCAA-record 77 punts (67 on first down). ) Charlie Calhoun still owns the NCAA record for number of punts in a single game. He punted 36 times for 1,318 yards in the game. 

***
*What Is and What is to Come*
***
Well, we have an almost entirely new coaching staff largely consisting of some of the greatest Red Raiders to set foot on the field. Kliff Kingsbury has returned home and brought several past All-Americans with him. New life and zeal has been breathed into the lungs of the fanbase and I am excited for the future. Kingsbury will have growing pains to struggle through, but I'm confident that he will be the best coach in school history and lead us to new heights. 
	
Next season poses several challenges, with questions about depth at several positions and an inexperienced quarterback. If the line stays healthy, I predict 9-5. If we get a couple of injuries on the offensive line I predict 7-5. If we get more than a couple injuries on the offensive line I predict pandemonium. If everyone stays healthy, and the offensive line figures it out, we could be very good next year. That being said, we could also be very bad next year.

Either way, [I am excite](http://i.imgur.com/CptO3mM.jpg) and optimistic for the future which is something I haven't been able to say in quite some time.

*Rivals*
***

* [](/washington) **U of Washington: The Apple Cup**

From the Cougar standpoint, the annual Apple Cup against the loathed in-state rival

 University of Washington is the most heated game on the schedule each year. This 

classic rivalry first met way back in 1900 which resulted in what I am sure was a 

killer match ending in a 5-5 tie. 

The game became the ""Apple Cup"" in 1962. Since then both sides have fought whole 

heartedly for the right to display the [trophy](http://i.imgur.com/Lw4fedq.jpg)  and to have [bragging rights that year](http://i.imgur.com/kGyFI6W.jpg). This 

electrifying game occurs around Thanksgiving, often setting the mood for the offseason. 

Holding the advantage, the Huskies lead the all time series 67-32-6. However, it seems 

ultimately whenever one side has a strong year, the opposing team finds a way to 

shut down their dreams. One of these games happened in 1982 when a considerably 

klutzy  2-7-1 Cougar team hosted the 5th ranked Huskies who were poised to enter 

into their third straight Rose Bowl. The Cougs dug deep and [pulled out a 24-20 win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=X8c3IzJnFu0#t=21s). An 

ecstatic cougar fan base stormed the field, [tore down the goal posts](http://i.imgur.com/bF02DwK.jpg), and [marched across town](http://i.imgur.com/0c6tQx7.jpg) 

slinging them into the Palouse river. Since then, the rivalry continues to be a bitter battle between the schools.

* [](/idaho) **Idaho: The Battle For The Palouse**

The University of Idaho is located [only 8 miles away from the WSU campus](http://goo.gl/maps/T89Wv) and thus a natural rivalry was born. The overall record is 70-18-3 in favor of the Cougs but we still take the rivalry very seriously. The proximity of the rivalry has spawned at least one funny tradition over the years, if the visiting team loses it’s said the fans have to walk home from the game. The last Battle between these two school was in 2007 while the next is set for 2013. This will be the first “Battle for the Palouse” in 6 seasons!

*2012 Season*
***

**Record: 3-9**

**Coach:** Mike Leach [](/pirate)

[**2012 Roster**](http://www.wsucougars.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/12-mtt.html)

**Key Players:**

* [Andrew Furney #49 K - ](http://www.cougcenter.com/2012/9/9/3305809/andrew-furney-60-yard-field-goal-gifs-video-wsu-vs-ewu) nuff said.
 While you often don't hear much about a teams kicker, Andrew Furney has developed a cult following at WSU. This individuals leg has produced 42 points this season alone, including one amazing 60 yard field goal and two crucial field goals during the 2012 Apple Cup - one of which brought the game into overtime, and a the second leading us to victory. 

* Deone Bucannon #20 S - 98 TOT, 59 SOLO, 39 AST, 1 Sack, 3 INT
While notorious for his collection of penalties this season, Deone boasts an outstanding record compared to his under performing team. Deone is an integral part of WSU’s defense as both a play stopper and play maker. [Bucannon vs Oregon interception](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4JZGKZg58vo#t=114s)

* Ioane Gauta #95 NT – 29 TOT, 15 SOLO, 14 AST, 3 Sack, 1 INT
Dubbed, “the Monster in the Middle”, Gauta’s rugged presence in the middle has helped the Cougars climb to 30th in the nation in rushing defense.  Gauta can often be identified by his hair exploding from the rear of his helmet. [Gauta and Sagote team sack on Keith Price](http://youtu.be/Y67gm7nlhHg)

* Travis Long #89 LB – 61 TOT, 44 Solo, 19 ast, 9.5 sack, 1 int
Before his injury, Travis managed an impressive senior year. He was named to the Pac-12 All-Academic Second Team and also was named WSU's defensive MVP following his Senior season.He was the recipient of the Laurie Niemi Award in his Senior season. [Travis Long vs BYU](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=dVtju56nqzE#t=254s)
* [Gabe Marks #84 WR](http://youtu.be/jwHgRwGbZPg) 49 Rec, 560 YDS, 11.4 AVG, 52 LONG, 2 TD and [Isiah Myers #88 WR](http://youtu.be/0qL-7sw1x-Q) 42 Rec, 438 YDS, 10.4 AVG, 36 LONG, 4 TD - Both receivers had to step up last season to fill the void left by Marquess Wilson. While each has their own particular talents - according to CougarNation - Myers may be the most prominent receiver on the Cougars current roster. 

**Honorable Mentions**

* Jeff Tuel #10 QB – 221 CMP, 332 ATT, 2087 YDS, 8TD, 8INT, 119.5 Rating (Could’ve used an O line)

**Dishonorable Mentions**

* Marquess Wilson #86 WR - Both a star and smudge on WSU’s history. over 3200 yards on 189 receptions totaling 25 TD’s... then this [crap](http://www.cougcenter.com/wsu-cougars-football/2013/1/8/3852506/pac-12-investigation-marquess-wilson-finally-speaks-on-mike-leach)

*THE GREATS:*

**Greatest Games:**

* [1992 Apple Cup - the Snow Bowl:](http://i.imgur.com/vTvh0BL.jpg) One of the most cherished moments by our fan base occurred in what possibly might have been the worst weather conditions the Apple Cup has even seen.  The Cougs, who hadn't won an Apple Cup since 1988, were hosting the 5th ranked, defending national champion husky team led by Mark Brunell. However, neither the huskies or the fierce -18 degree wind whipping weather could stop Drew Bledsoe and the Cougars as they put together a 29-point third quarter. This barrage of scoring included one of the [most replayed highlights of cougar football.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eykkSTEcVdg). The lead provided a cushion that UW would not be able to overcome the rest of the game resulting in a 42-23 victory for the Cougs. The win led to a berth to the Copper Bowl where the Cougs maintained their momentum and defeated Utah.

* [2003 Holiday Bowl:](http://i.imgur.com/UYDNfj6.jpg) The 15th ranked Cougars entered the Holiday Bowl heavily unfavored against the 5th ranked Texas Longhorns. Battling a team that contained RB Cedric Benson and RS QB freshman Vince Young, the Cougs stumbled early and ended the first half down to the Horns 10-7.  In the second half, the defense decided to show up in a huge way, allowing the Cougs to go on a 19-0 run in the third quarter. Texas responded in the fourth quarter with two scores to pull within 8 points, but the cougar defense displayed their dominance once again denying the Longhorns on two separate drives [late in the game to secure a victory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ugkLbI7WA). The comeback allowed the cougars to hit the 10-win plateau for the third straight year, going 30-8 in that time span.

* [1997 Apple Cup:](http://i.imgur.com/F9xrpQX.jpg) Entering the game, WSU was on the verge of it's first Rose Bowl berth in 67 years. Led by Ryan Leaf, the cougars battled back and forth with an unrelenting husky team looking to smash any hopes the Cougs had for roses. It was a tight 7-7 game in the middle of the second quarter when [Leaf connected with Chris Jackson who took it 57 yards to the endzone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm7ONFZTc-I). This play was the beginning of 17 unanswered cougar points. Refusing to quit, the huskies crawled back to within 3 and threatened the cougar’s lead. Leaf then connected once again with Jackson for a 50-yard TD pass showing he had his sights set on the Rose bowl. The Cougs held on til the end eventually winning 41-35. They then went to Pasadena where they unfortunately fell to #1 Michigan.

* [2008 Apple Cup - The Crapple Cup:](http://i.imgur.com/r9HbAOr.jpg) It may not have been one of the greatest games, but it was definitely one of the most memorable ones recent history. [Gaining national attention](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?page=bottom100812), these two teams met in Pullman with a combined 1-20 record on the season. The only win between the two schools was a 48-9 WSU victory over the powerhouse Portland State. Despite having the only win between the two schools, WSU entered the game as an 8.5 point underdog to the 0-10 Huskies. The match was a bit painful to watch for the first 59 minutes of game time, but with less than a minute left in the fourth quarter, QB Kevin Lopina hit WR Brandon Gibson to convert a third-and-1 and led the Cougs on a 69-yard drive that would result in a FG to send the game into overtime tied at 10. During the first OT, the Cougs went up a field goal only to be matched by the Huskies. In the second OT, Husky K Ryan Perkins missed wide right from 37 yards setting up a chance for victory for the Cougs. After only advancing a mere 5 yards, WSU K Nico Grasu [drilled his attempt from 37 yards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXmzb_5lDk) sending the team, and the fans, into a frenzy on the field. The defeated Huskies would eventually lose their final game against Cal to become the first team in the Pac-10 to go 0-12 and the only team in the country to finish the season without a win in 2008.

**Greatest Plays:**

* [Why not just watch a video?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1wu9Aoa9vLA) Lots of good ones in there including some stingers against Texas, Michigan, Oregon, Notre Dame and of course the Dawgs.

* [And here is an instant classic from last years Apple Cup.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=vOofoyYTM80#t=425s)

**Greatest Players:**

* Drew Bledsoe - **4x Pro Bowl, 2x All-Pro, 2x AFC Champ, Super Bowl Champion QB**. Also the owner of [Doubleback Winery](http://www.doubleback.com/) in his hometown of Walla Walla in Eastern Washington (which is a great wine region) The only time I have seen this wine for sale, it was $100 a bottle at Wine World. So it’s likely quality.

* Mark Rypien - **Super Bowl MVP, 2x Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowl QB** from Spokane. A local Cougar hero and legend. His daughter Angela [played for the](http://i.imgur.com/8bXuQfd.jpg) [lingerie football league](http://i.imgur.com/MNsasnq.jpg) (NSFW?). And his nephew [Brett Rypien](http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Brett-Rypien-144354) is breaking his uncle’s records in the Greater Spokane League and already holds offers from Wazzu, Idaho and Colorado State going into his junior season.

* Mel Hein - **NFL Hall Of Fame, 4x Pro Bowl, 5x All-Pro, 2x NFL Champion, The only OL to win MVP, 1930s All-Decade Team, NFL 75th Anniversary Team**. Mel Hein was a beast among men. He lead the Cougars to an undefeated 1931 season and into the Rose Bowl against Alabama. He was an All-American at WSU and also played Center on the WSU basketball team. His number is retired by both Washington State University and the New York Giants. 

* Marcus Trufant - The 11th overall pick by the Seattle Seahawks sealed Trufant’s legacy in history as not only an all time great for the Cougars and Seahawks, but as a Northwest sports hero in general. Trufant was born in raised in Tacoma, Washington and stayed here his entire football career until he signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars this offseason. He was Pac-10 All-Freshman, First-Team Pac-10 and Second-Team All-American during his years with the Cougs. He allowed **zero** TDs against him in his final two season at WSU.

* Jason Hanson - Hanson is another Spokane native that played for WSU. He holds the record for longest kick in WSU history at 62 yards. An All-American in his Sophomore season he also holds the WSU records for points scored (328) and most field goal related records. He had one of the longest NFL careers of anybody and retired this year after 20 seasons. He is the #3 all time leader in points in the NFL as well as the #3 leader in field goals made. Hanson is a 2x Pro Bowler and 3x All-Pro.

* Ryan Leaf had a magnificent career at WSU, but he is more widely known for being one of, if not the biggest, busts in NFL history. He was selected 2nd overall in the 1998 draft behind Peyton Manning by the San Diego Chargers. Once his NFL career ended, he entered into a coaching position at West Texas A&amp;M. Here, not only his coaching career, but his life spiraled out of control as it became evident he had a serious drug addiction problem with painkillers. After years of probation, rehab, burglary, threats, and continued drug abuse, [Leaf ran out of second chances and now resides in the Montana State Prison](http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8854058/ryan-leaf-booted-treatment-center-prison). It is definitely a darker side of cougar athletic history, and many fans are touchy about the subject, but Leaf remains one of the most prominent athletes to have played WSU. In his junior year, he averaged 330.6 yards passing per game and threw for a then Pac-10 conference record 33 touchdowns. Everyone hopes Leaf will pull his life together, but some wonder what more can even be done to help.

**Greatest Coaches:**

* **Mike Price (1989-2002) 83-78** -  Price was good friends with Dennis Erickson and when Erickson left WSU for Miami he recommended Price for the job. Price rented Erickson’s home and ended up staying in Pullman for 13 years. During that span he won 3 bowl games and led two Rose Bowl squads in 1997 and 2002. Price coached many famous WSU players including Drew Bledsoe, Ryan Leaf, Jason Gesser and Marcus Trufant. Fuck you Alabama.

* **Jim Walden (1978-1986) 44-52-4** - Jim Walden will always be great in the eyes of Cougar fans because he loved spoiling the Huskies’ season. He also ended a bowless streak that had gone on for 51 years by leading to the Cougars to the 1981 Holiday Bowl against the BYU Cougars. He also coached Cougar greats Jack “The Throwing Samoan” Thompson, Mark Rypien. and Reuben Mayes.

[**Wave The Flag**](http://www.olcrimson.org/)

 The GameDay Wave The Flag movement first began back in 2003 when the Cougs were ranked 6th in the nation. It started off as a simple showing of school pride and spirit but quickly evolved into a campaign to bring GameDay to Pullman. It has since then become a tradition to have a cougar flag, nicknamed Ol' Crimson, to be a part of every broadcast until GameDay decides to grace Pullman with their presence. Ol' Crimson has not missed a GameDay since it first started and is looking to continue the streak (which currently sits at 132 consecutive shows) this upcoming season. The Flag has grown into something much bigger and has become a viral campaign with fans flying the flag in crazy places all over the world. You might have been here when /u/avboden [posted pictures flying the flag at a sunken ship](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/183qn3/today_i_flew_the_flag_on_a_sunken_cruise_ship_at/).

**Homecoming**

As I assume it is with all college towns homecoming weekend is pretty special. Once you graduate there really aren’t a whole lot of reasons to go to back Pullman besides sporting events and homecoming, of which the latter draws a HUGE alumni crowd.

[Homecoming day celebration and Bonfire](http://i.imgur.com/M5HW3mP.jpg)

Students have been given the ability to choose our uniform combinations for both our Homecoming game and any home Apple Cup matchup.

**Glenn Johnson**

The man who has made himself tradition. Not only is Glenn Johnson the voice of Cougar football, he’s also a professor at WSU and the Mayor of Pullman. Every first down is met with [“And that’s another Cougar first down!”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=so53fBCZ6vQ#t=2s) with a Cougar growl at the end. He has been our voice since the 1980s and sadly he may be stepping down soon (they already have a new announcer for some of the more minor basketball games).

* [Beasley Coliseum](http://i.imgur.com/pVnVADL.jpg)

* [Kinda Cheesy, but great view of campus](http://youtu.be/pPnQi0FgoP8)

**Local Dining:**

* [Cougar County](http://i.imgur.com/rD07t6n.jpg) - While it is far from being on campus, Cougar Country Drive In is currently one of the most popular “fast food” restaurants in Pullman.  With a menu ranging from the “Cougar Super Basket”   (two ¼ lb patties with all the fixings), Chili Dogs, BBQ Beef sandwiches, and even Fish and Chips. The Store is completely manned by students, including many WSU athletes. Cougar Country has a great connection to the city of Pullman, and often uses their giant sign to advertise everything from [“Important Sporting News”](http://i.imgur.com/NhwTS0R.jpg?1?6434) to [Homecoming Proposals](http://i.imgur.com/kV0kcwb.jpg)


* [The Coug](http://i.imgur.com/fAj71Ri.jpg) - Located right off campus at the end of Greek Row, The Coug - or Cougar Cottage - contains good food, cold drinks, low prices and is a very popular game day attraction. Along the walls of the Coug, students have the opportunity to help contribute to the [decorations](http://i.imgur.com/6C8VjYS.jpg).
Fun Fact: The Coug was featured as a question on [College Jeopardy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=EB_cJT3VPT4#t=16s)

* [Sella’s Calzone and Pizza](http://i.imgur.com/TynrsT9.jpg) - Sella’s is located at the end of campus located closest to the dorms. Like many Italian restaurants, Sella’s has giant servings, of which many are reasonably priced. Sella’s leaves crayons and paper on the tables for kids to draw on. However, many students take advantage of the crayons to express their artistic side. The best of these artworks are posted on the walls throughout [the Restaurant](http://i.imgur.com/QDGW3sj.jpg)

* [Munchy’z](http://www.munchyz.com/) - Munchy’z is a hookah bar located on Greek Row. While they are known for their hookahs, Munchy’z most popular contribution to Pullman would be their late night Hot Dogs. During the Weekends, Munchy’z opens an outdoor grill where they make their famous hot dogs (which are a must have if celebrating in Pullman!)
Also they deliver cigarettes.

*Random Trivia:*
***

* Mike Leach has an incentive in his contract for $25,000 every time he beats Washington home or away. Last year when the Cougs won, it was rumored Leach paid the entire bars tab for the night at Valhalla located on Greek Row a block away from The Coug.

* The Palouse refers to the agricultural region that encompasses parts of southeastern Washington, north central Idaho, and extending into parts of northeast Oregon. The region was a popular end destination for those who did not die of dysentery along the Oregon trail. It is home to both WSU and U of Idaho.

* The very first football game for our school took place on Nov 10, 1894 against University of Idaho. At that time, our school's name and mascot were the mighty Washington Agricultural College Farmers. We won 10-0

* The first school colors were pink and blue, said to be chosen by the first WSU President when he was so in awe of the blue and pink sunsets of the Palouse. It is unknown when the official colors changed, though Crimson and Gray are thought to have been the colors by 1916, when we won the first annual Rose Bowl (thank god)

* The cougar wasn't adopted to be our mascot until our 1919 victory over Cal when a San Francisco newspaper cartoonist depicted the game as a bear trying to free itself from a northwest cougar

* [Our logo](http://i.imgur.com/2VXY50m.png) was created by Randall Johnson, an art student at then called Washington State College in 1936, who wanted to incorporate his art in lettering to produce a logo that would include the letters WSC. Once the president saw it, he immediately decided to make it the official logo of the state college. In 1959 when the school became a university, the president sent a request to Johnson to revise the logo and change the C into a U. Johnson happily obliged and sold the rights for his logo to the school for $1. 

* On the weekend before classes begin each year at WSU, Pullman holds the annual [National Lentil Festival](http://www.lentilfest.com/), an event celebrating everyone’s favorite legumes. It was started back in 1989 to promote both tourism and the locally grown lentils. At the time of the original festival, 98% of the United States crop of lentils were grown in the Palouse.

* Popular non-athlete alumni from WSU include Timothy Leary (acid icon who coined ""turn on, tune in, drop out""), Bill Nye (the science guy), Paul Allen (co-founder of Microsoft and owner of the Seahawks and Trailblazers), Edward R. Murrow (father of broadcast journalism), and Gary Larson (author of  the comic the Far Side) who [created a mural](http://i.imgur.com/YtnB5o6.jpg) that is currently displayed on campus in Beasley Coliseum

* In the 1930's, the US government provided funds to WSU to research new ways to store cheese. WSU created a way to store cheese in tins and during the process, ended up creating a cheese so wonderful that they dubbed it ""Cougar Gold."" [The WSU Creamery](http://public.wsu.edu/creamery/) was established and currently produces over 250,000 cans of cheese each year, 80% of which being Cougar Gold (which is fucking delicious), as well as 18,000 gallons of ice cream.

* Washington State University currently is the home of a 1MW Nuclear Reactor. The Reactor was the brainchild of Harold W. Dodgen, a former researcher on the Manhattan Project, and a WSU Alumnus.  [Video of a Reactor Pulse](http://youtu.be/qCH3Yiyw3yc)

* WSU also boasts a Bear Center on campus, hosting both adult and cub grizzly bears. The bears cardiovascular systems are studied during their hibernation cycle due to the similarities to a resting bear heart and a human heart facing heart disease.

*What Is and What Is to Come:*
***

As the offseason lags on, the mood of the Cougar fan base for the upcoming season remains excited, yet a bit more reserved than it was last year ripe with the hiring of Mike Leach. The team will have quite the different feel to it with the departure of star senior athletes QB Jeff Tuel , linebacker Travis Long, and estranged WR Marquess Wilson. However, despite these losses, WSU will not be lacking in experience. Wazzu leads the PAC-12 in [returning career starts with 359](http://espn.go.com/photo/preview/130401/espn_returning_starter_counts2.pdf), including up and coming players such as QB Connor Halliday, WR Gabe Marks, WR Isiah Myers, S Deone Bucannon, and husky killer K Andrew Furney.

This recruiting season may not have been a flashy one (ranking between 9-11 with Rivals, Scout, ESPN, and 247) but Leach bulked up on where we needed improvement the most: both the offensive and defensive lines. One of the most exciting prospects 4* AZ QB Tyler Bruggman led WSU into a bit of a panic on signing day when he flip flopped between ASU and WSU, but he eventually confirmed his committed with the Cougs at the end of the day. When asked about the drama on signing day, Leach stated he was unaware of any offers to Bruggman from ASU, but that he did receive an excellent [lasagna recipe from Bruggman's mother the night before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=7fvyuhLf5qE#t=545s).

The schedule this upcoming season provides WSU ample opportunity to improve on last years record of 3-9.  The non-conference line up includes games at Auburn, and hosting both Southern Utah and old Palouse rival Idaho. This season's conference games will include home matches against Stanford, Oregon St, Arizona St, and Utah and will travel to play USC, Cal, Oregon, Arizona and UW. Worst case scenario would be a repeat 3-9 record, with only being able to scrounge a single conference win and having two close calls against nonconference foes S. Utah and U of I. Best case scenario (in my completely biased and homeristic opinion) would be a 10-3 record and an appearance in the Rose Bowl, [as summarized here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/18mygs/itt_be_the_biggest_homer_you_can_be_and_lay_out/c8ga1dw). However, becoming bowl eligible would be welcomed warmly by a fan base who hasn't seen the Cougs in a bowl for a decade.

* Steve Gleason - Former WSU LB that was a part of the 1998 Rose Bowl team who later become well known for his blocked punt while playing for the Saints in 2006 reviving a city’s fan base that was still recovering from hurricane Katrina. He also was a 4 year starter for the WSU Baseball team and continues to hold the school record for triples to this day. In 2011 he revealed he was battling ALS and launched his campaign Team Gleason No White Flags promoting public awareness and striving towards a cure. Check out his website http://www.teamgleason.org/ to find out more.

* Whether it’s to escape the summer heat or blow off some stress, students often flock just outside of Pullman to [hang out at dunes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywMgDV2IJ74&amp;feature=youtu.be) along the Snake River.


* Hey Cougs in the Seattle area! There is a organization called CougsFirst that’s dedicated the spreading the word about Cougar owned and operated businesses. There is a yearly trade show in Bellevue with 60+ Cougar alum owned and operated business and they organize other events with the Alumni Association. Check them out on Facebook:

* Tony Taylor, UGA, 2006

Heisman finalist?  

* Hardly. **2nd team All-SEC.**
 
Te'o = +7 tackles, **-2 tackles for loss, same INT, -1.5 sacks, -2 fumble recoveries, -1 TD**


Taylor's season was (at worst) statistically the same to Te'o's and he was *2nd team All-SEC.*

That's exactly how pedestrian Te'o's numbers are.  I'm not discounting the value of having a winning team (UGA was 9-4 in 2006) but I think we can all agree that this Te'o hooplah is based on the love for Notre Dame and the sexy idea of having a truly defensive player win it.  

Manziel and Klein's numbers are incredible on their own right, not because they play on teams who had good seasons. (a la RG3)

**National Titles:**

1957 with coach Ralph ""Shug"" Jordan and 2010 with Coach Gene Chizik

**Rivals:**

**[The Iron Bowl](http://i.imgur.com/Fxpdrit.jpg):** Alabama and Auburn have played 77 games starting in 1893. The games were originally played on Legion Field in Birmingham, but in 1989 the system changed and now it alternates between home stadiums. (Side note, Auburn won the first game played at home against Alabama.) Both teams have very dedicated fans, and Alabama has a famously large fanbase. But to be fair, most of Alabama's[[1]](http://i.imgur.com/gIH99Xj.jpg) fans[[2]](http://i.imgur.com/dT5jGhD.jpg) are[[3]](http://i.imgur.com/Nz75KyG.png) really[[4]](http://i.imgur.com/aMCPOu8.jpg) normal[[5]](http://i.imgur.com/mmZtgR4.jpg) people[[6]](http://i.imgur.com/YcVvh1x.jpg) just[[7]](http://i.imgur.com/RYdaFOL.jpg) like[[8]](http://i.imgur.com/2ljWpxY.jpg) you[[9]](http://i.imgur.com/pEenEHa.jpg)! The Iron Bowl is a nationally famous game that, not regarding Auburn's less than stellar [performance](http://i.imgur.com/hEeL7Qq.jpg) last year, typically proves to be a solid [matchup.](http://i.imgur.com/9e0kUee.jpg) **Sidenote: With Alabama winning the national title last season, the state of Alabama has 4 consecutive National Championships, which is the current record. In favor of Alabama, with 42-34-1

**[The Deep South's Oldest Rivalry:](http://i.imgur.com/m3EFp9A.jpg)** Beginning in 1892, [The University of Georgia](http://i.imgur.com/sdyOoZt.jpg) and [Auburn](http://i.imgur.com/XbPpYi4.jpg) have played 115 games with a tied record of 54-54-8. Needless to say, this [rivalry game](http://i.imgur.com/9f2en7k.jpg) is always [intense](http://i.imgur.com/S3kroEP.jpg) and as both fanbases can attest, is always a tossup. This rivalry is the oldest in the southern states, and the two teams have played each other every season since 1892 barring three games interrupted by WWI and WWII. **Side note: the first game we played in 1892 is credited as the game where the ""War Eagle"" chant was coined, when Auburn went on to win 10-0. 

""It's a unique thing. It's like playing against your brother. I don't think anybody who plays in that game can ever forget it. It just doesn't matter much where it's played or what somebody's record is. It's so intense and tough, but at the same time, it's family."" - [Coach Pat Dye](http://i.imgur.com/tFADVCV.png)

**[Tiger Bowl:](http://i.imgur.com/v7gtXPU.jpg)** LSU and Auburn have played 47 games since 1901. Another big tossup game. Both teams usually play very well against each other (as seen in the 2012 season) and every game typically has an edge-of-your-seat ending. **Side note: It is referred to as the Tiger Bowl due to the fact both Auburn and Lsu have Tiger Mascots. Clearly though, Aubie is superior to this guy: [HUURRR](http://i.imgur.com/LwCAfhX.jpg) (However, I must concede LSU has a very badass real life tiger mascot..) In favor of LSU with 26-20-1

**[Auburn-Florida](http://i.imgur.com/m6ITaVI.jpg):** 83 games since 1912. In favor of Auburn with 43-38-2

**[Auburn-Georgia Tech](http://i.imgur.com/q4rgie3.jpg):** 92 games since 1892. Many fans want this rivalry rekindled; last game played was in 2005. In favor of Auburn with 47-41-4

**[Auburn-Tennessee](http://i.imgur.com/kjd6qKx.jpg):** 51 games since 1900. In favor of Auburn with 27-21-3

**[Auburn-Tulane](http://i.imgur.com/zDkGUI0.jpg):** 37 games since 1902. In favor of Tulane, with 17-14-6

**[Auburn-Clemson](http://i.imgur.com/fQa3BZy.jpg):** 48 games since 1899. In favor of Auburn with 34-13-2

**2012 Season:**

[Record](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/schedule/_/id/2/auburn-tigers) 3-9 (0-8)
Coached by [Gene Chizik](http://i.imgur.com/c8805rL.jpg)

**[2012 Roster](http://www.auburntigers.com/sports/m-footbl/roster-mtt.html)**

**Key Players:**

[Tre Mason](http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/511828/tre-mason): Tre Mason lead our team in rushing yards as a sophomore. He had 171 carries for over 1000 yds. He averaged 5.9 with 8 TDs. Mason was and will be a solid RB who can be relied on to get us some yards. [Ontario McCalebb](http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/480385/onterio-mccalebb) ran for 570 yds with 94 carries. He averaged 6.1 yds and ended the season with 6 TDs. Where Mason was our strongman, McCalebb was all speed. 

[Emory Blake](http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/480370/emory-blake) led our receivers with 50 receptions for 789 yds. He averaged 15.8 yds and had 3 TDs. 

[Kiehl Frazier](http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/515946/kiehl-frazier) He had 62 completions out of 116 attempts for 753 yards. He had 2 TDs and 8 Interceptions. I couldn't really leave our QB out of this section, but Frazier was anything but Key. He fell apart in many key situations and when he had to made a quick decision, it was usually the wrong one. It's argued if we had run Malzahn's offense Frazier could've been great, but it's all speculation and he was eventually benched in favor of freshman Jonathan Wallace. 

**Biggest Plays:**

[Tre Mason's 83 yd run for a TD.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljM6v8fCuJY) Yes, I get it. Alabama A&amp;M. Honestly, after such a rough season, watching Mason get this TD just felt great. 

[Sammie Coates' hail mary reception](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbUe5Bah_Wg) Oh man, this was just too great to watch. Student section went nuts!

[Cody Parkey game-winning FG](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WECSnFW13Zc) After two losses, this win in OT felt awesome. And Parkey is just the man. 

And my personal favorite: [Daren Bates' Fumble recovery TD with a brutal stiff arm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuBBdJfw9V8) 

**2013 Season:**

**[Schedule](http://www.auburntigers.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/aub-m-footbl-sched-2013.html):** I think we have a favorable schedule to play in 2013. I expect LSU, TA&amp;M, Georgia, and Alabama to be our most difficult games next year, with a chance of an upset over LSU and UGA. 

**The Greats:** 

**Greatest Games:** 

**Iron Bowl- 1982 ""Bo over the top"":** With two minutes remaining, Auburn drove the length of the field and scored when running back Bo Jackson jumped over the top of the defensive line for a touchdown. Auburn won the game 23–22. The victory ended Alabama's nine-game winning streak over Auburn. Coach Bear Bryant ended his career with the loss. [In case you missed it earlier](http://i.imgur.com/Fxpdrit.jpg)

**Athens- 1983:** After narrowly losing at home to UGA in the only matchup of Bo Jacson and Herschel Walker, the 1983 game in Athens was perfect for a sweet game of revenge. The 13-7 win not being all that impressive, but it finally dethroned Georgia and set up Auburn to be dominate for most of the remainder of the 80s. 

**SEC Championship Game 2010:** Wiki game notes- ""The No. 1 ranked BCS team had lost its conference championship game three seasons in a row and Auburn ended the record this year. Auburn broke the SEC Championship Game records for most offensive yards, most points scored and largest margin of victory. Auburn receiver Darvin Adams set the game record for most receiving yards with 217. Auburn quarterback Cam Newton matched the game record for touchdown responsibility with six, four throwing and two running.""

**Iron Bowl- 1989:** This would be the first Iron Bowl played in Jordan-Hare Stadium. There was plenty of complaint from angry Alabama fans demanding we play on Legion Field, but with a compromise to play 1991 game in Birmingham, the game was back on. After a thrilling game, the final score was 30-20, and marked four straight Iron Bowl wins for Auburn. **Side note, the ""Tiger Walk"" reached legendary proportions with 20,000 fans lining the block to pump up the team. 


**And of course, the Iron Bowl 2010: ""The Cam-Back""** Without a doubt, the most epic Iron Bowl, and as many would agree, the best football game Auburn ever played. The Tigers were getting smacked down in the beginning, with a 24-0 deficit. Cam rallied the team to throw for three touchdowns and running one in himself to win 28-27. It was the biggest comeback in school history, and solidified Cam's run for the Heisman and Auburn's chances of going to the BCS Championship. 

**Greatest Plays:**

**[Bo Jackson ""over the top"":](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDeAWbxgTfE)** Explained above; won us one of our best games/iron bowls. 

**[CFA Bowl Statue of Liberty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPiFUF-dTi4)** I personally just loved seeing this kind of creativity and it helped win us our fifth straight bowl game. Especially since the 2012 season was so devoid of any creativity haha. 

**[Cam Newton/2010 team best plays](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2vbPJJL5Pg)** Couldn't pick my favorite Cam play, so I just put up a highlight video. 

**Best Players**

**Pat Sullivan:** Quarterback during the Ralph ""Shug"" Jordan era, led the Tigers to a 9-2 season and a trip to the Sugar Bowl. Auburn's first Heisman winner and first retired Jersey number (7).

**Bo Jackson:** Running back for Auburn from 1982-1985 for a total of 4,303 yds and 45 TDs. He won the Heisman in '85 and has his number retired (34). In 2007 Jackson was ranked 8th on ESPN's top 25 players in College Football History. ""You Don't Know Bo"" is an ESPN 30 for 30 that is definitely worth watching if you haven't yet. 

**Cam Newton:** Quarterback in the 2010 season, Cam led the team in his first year to win the BCS championship game. He had a 66.1% completion rate for 2,854 yds resulting in 30 passing TDs. Furthermore he rushed for 1,473 yds for 20 rushing TDs. Cam won the Heisman Trophy, becoming Auburn's third Heisman recipient.

**Greatest Coaches:** 

**Ralph ""Shug"" Jordan:** (1951-1975) Half of our stadium's namesake, Jordan is our winningest coach in Auburn history. He ended his coaching career with a 175-83-7 record. He led the Tigers to their first National Championship in school history in 1957. 

**Pat Dye:** (1981-1992) Pat Dye was Auburn's head coach during some of the best games and seasons Auburn has had. He coached Bo Jackson, and won over Bear Bryant in his last Iron bowl. Dye was the coach during the late 80s, one of Auburn football's best eras. He is the third winningest coach behind Jordan and Mike Donahue, with a record of 99-39-4. Auburn's football field is named after him. 

**Traditions:**

**Tiger Walk:** Before each Auburn home football game, thousands of Auburn fans line Donahue Drive to cheer on the team as they walk from the Auburn Athletic Complex to Jordan-Hare Stadium. The tradition began in the 1950s when groups of kids would walk up the street to greet the team and get autographs. During the tenure of coach Doug Barfield, the coach urged fans to come out and support the team, and thousands did. Today the team walks down the hill and into the stadium surrounded by fans who pat them on the back and shake their hands as they walk. Every Auburn Student is expected to participate at least once before graduating!

**""War Eagle"":** So there are several versions of the origin of the ""War Eagle"" tradition (Wiki has a different version if you are interested), but I'm going to share the version I was told. Okay, so way back in 1892, there was an old civil war veteran who had a pet eagle that he had rescued during the war. Some versions say he was just a local, others say he was a professor. Either way, fast forward to Auburn's first football game against UGA. The game was tied 0-0 and was beginning to wind down. The Tigers had driven towards the opposing endzone, and needed to score. Just then, the eagle flew off the Veteran's shoulder and began to circle the field (just like our current eagles do before a home game). A student recognized it as the Veteran's ""war eagle"", and began to shout, ""look everyone, it's the war eagle!"" Everyone began to point and chant ""war eagle"" to encourage the football team. It worked, and the tigers scored on the next play, going on to win 10-0. So now, while our mascot is a tiger, our battle cry (much like ""go dawgs, roll tide, Geaux tigers, etc) is ""war eagle"" to honor the old eagle who rallied us to [victory.](http://i.imgur.com/QiXSwCR.jpg)

**Toomer's Corner:** The intersection of Magnolia and College streets in Auburn, which marks the transition from downtown Auburn to the university campus, is known as Toomer's Corner. It is named after Toomer's Drugs, a small store on the corner that has been an Auburn landmark since 1896. Hanging over the corner are two massive old oak trees, planted in 1937, and whenever there is cause for celebration in the Auburn community, toilet paper can usually be found hanging from the trees. Unfortunately, it is these same trees that Harvey Updyke, a disgruntled (and partially insane) Alabama fan poisoned with lethal amounts of tree killer. The trees will not survive, and there will be a sending-off party in April before we take them down for good. The tradition will continue however, by transplanting new fully grown trees in their place and rolling something else (has not yet been determined) in the interim. The tradition began when the Toomer's drugstore owner heard about an Auburn away game win over the radio, and ran outside to roll the trees in ticker tape to let everyone know the Tigers won. This tradition continued to grow and develop into the toilet paper rolling tradition it is today. **sidenote: Toomer's Corner is famous for its lemonade, which is made by hand right in front of you. If you visit Auburn, it is a must try! 

*Auburn has countless other traditions, but I don't have time or space to list them all!*

She is the only baton twirler that performs at the University, and she keeps the title “Golden Girl” through her entire four years at Iowa. She is usually one of the top in the country and it is a very big honor to earn the title.

**The Forgotten Season**: In 1960, the Hawks defeated many top 25 teams on their way to a number one ranking coming with only a few games remaining. They then lost to #3 ranked Minnesota in Minneapolis. Due to Big Ten rules, only one team was allowed to play in a bowl game so even with Iowa finishing 2nd in the polls, they did not play in a bowl game. Thus, the Forgotten Season.

*Rivals*
***

* Iowa State- Battle for the Cy-Hawk Trophy - [current Cy-Hawk Trophy](http://i.imgur.com/KCHuf3D.jpg)
 The Hawkeyes and the Cyclones originally began playing in 1894 but the two halted the series from 1934 to 1977 after fan vitriol between the two factions became too violent.  Iowa currently leads the overall series 39-21 though the Iowa State has won the last two.

* Minnesota- [Floyd of Rosedale](http://i.imgur.com/0RgWR8e.jpg)
In 1934 the Gophers routed the Hawkeyes 48-12 on their way to a national title, but the Iowa fans cried foul.  During the game Minnesota players had targeted Iowa’s star back and safety Ozzie Simmons, roughly attacking and beating the black player because of the color of his skin.  Prior to the 1935 game in Iowa City Iowa Governor Clyde Herring issue a veiled threat, that even if the officials allowed the same kind of rough play in Iowa City the crowd would not (implying that Iowa fans would riot).  To diffuse tensions Minnesota Governor Floyd Olsen wagered Herring that the governor of the winning team’s state would be awarded a prize winning pig from the losing team’s state. Minnesota won the game fairly 13-6 and Minnesota was given a prize winning hog from Rosedale Farms in Fort Dodge, Iowa. The pig was later named Floyd of Rosedale in honor of the Minnesota governor and the name of the farm.  The pig died a few years later but the rivalry between the schools is symbolically represented by the bronze pig statue the teams now play for.  In 2008, Rivals.com named the Floyd of Rosedale the top rivalry trophy in college football. Minnesota currently leads the series 61–43–2.

* Wisconsin- Battle for the [Heartland Trophy](http://i.imgur.com/WrQuE1t.jpg). Although this rivalry is over 100 years old, the trophy is a relatively new addition being added back in 2004. The overall series is tied 42-42-2, though Iowa has a slight advantage of 4-3 since the trophy was installed in 2004.  Wisconsin Athletic Director was an assistant coach under legendary Iowa head man Hayden Fry and former Wisconsin head coach Brett Bielema was not only a standout defensive end and team captain for the Hawkeyes but also famously has a tattoo of the Iowa logo on his calf. 

* Nebraska: The [Heroes Game](http://i.imgur.com/wAjtJYs.jpg)- Played on Black Friday, this game is unique in the fact that each state honors a hero during the halftime of every game. Until there is a major upset in this game, it is likely to remain being seen as a forced rivalry for years to come.

*2012 Season*    
***  
**Record:** [4-8](http://es.pn/Z8HJDt)   
**Turning Point of the season:** 

In the 2nd quarter of the Penn St. game, the Hawks (who were already struggling with injuries at running back) had two season ending injuries in three plays on the offensive line. From there, the Hawks offense (which was already having problems) became inept for the rest of the year, going winless the rest of the season.

***
*The Greats*    
****
**Greatest Games:** 

* 1921 vs. Notre Dame: the Hawkeyes handed Knute Rockne’s squad their first loss since 1918, winning 10-7 in Iowa City.  The Iowa victory ended Knute Rockne’s longest winning streak (20 games) as head coach of the Irish.
 
* 1922 at Yale: Iowa led by Howard Jones, became the first team from the ‘West’ to come into the Yale bowl and defeat the sons of Eli.  The Hawkeyes 6-0 victory was over a bell-weather for the demise of the Ivy League as the nation’s premier football conference.

* 1939 v. Notre Dame: Nile Kinnick scored the game’s lone touchdown and kicked the extra point as the Iowa Hawkeyes defeated the Irish 7-6.  Kinnick also recorded 16 punts in the game, with the final kick sailing 63 yards and halting at the Notre Dame five yard line with under two minutes to go.

* 1977 v. Iowa State: The Hawkeyes defeated the Cyclones 12-10 in the first meeting between the two in-state rivals in 43 years.  Iowa State, who wore jerseys that said “Beat Iowa” on the front for the game, managed only 96 total yards during the contest.

* 1985 vs. Michigan: #1 Iowa defeated #2 Michigan 12-10 in Kinnick Stadium with the help of a Rob Houghlin field goal as time expired in the fourth quarter. [Link] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzSpaEnA64)

* 1987 at Ohio State: The Hawkeyes claimed a 29-27 victory after a 29 yard touchdown pass from Chuck Hartlieb to Marv Cook in the games’ final seconds.  The game led to the eventual firing of Buckeye coach Earl Bruce.

* 1991 at Ohio State: Coach Hayden Fry led the Hawkeyes to a 16-9 victory in the Horseshoe.  The Hawkeyes wore all black helmets in remembrance for the victims of a mass shooting which occurred on the University of Iowa campus three days before the game. [Link] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUbzH-aND4)

* 2002 at Michigan: The Hawkeyes turned the Wolverines’ homecoming into a route, claiming a 34-9 victory which was, at the time, the worst home loss in Michigan history since 1967 and the worst homecoming loss for the Wolverine’s. [Link] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eukaQpnTrf0)

* 2002 at Minnesota: Iowa routed the Gophers 45-21 and the Hawkeyes took home a share of the Big Ten title for the first time since the 1990 season.  After the game Iowa fans stormed the Metrodome field and tore down the Minnesota goalposts and attempted, unsuccessfully, to take pieces of them through the stadium’s revolving doors. [Link] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQP1L7hip_I)
        
* 2005 vs. LSU Capitol One Bowl “The Catch”: Drew Tate threw a 56 yard TD pass as time expired to Warren Holloway to give Iowa the victory. The TD was the only of Holloway’s career. [Link] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0OnvDbyGuQ)
      
* 2008 vs. Penn State: Iowa defeated national championship contender Penn State on a last second field goal to win 24-23 and give Penn St. it’s only loss of the season. [Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur0clGs3Rsk)


**Greatest Players:** 

* [Nile Kinnick](http://sportsthenandnow.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Kinnick-Heisman-2-300x233.jpg): Iowa’s only Heisman Trophy winner. Kinnick took the Hawkeye football team from nearly winless when he arrived to nearly undefeated when he left. The star player nearly every award in the country including Time Magazine’s “Man of the Year” (the first ever collegiate athlete to do so, beating out Joe Dimaggio).  As a player Kinnick finished his 1939 Heisman season having scored 107 of Iowa’s 130 team points on the year.  In addition to being a prolific offensive player, statistically he remains one of the greatest defensive backs and punters in Iowa football history with 18 career interceptions and 6,866 punting yards.  Rather than play professionally, he joined the Navy where he later died due to a oil leak which caused his plane to crash during a training mission. Nile was known for his calm demeanor and overall kind-heartedness, which really showed in what some people call [the greatest Heisman speech of all time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiw8DD222Rw#t=00m57s)
      
* [Calvin Jones](http://i.cdn.turner.com/sivault/si_online/covers/images/1954/0927_large.jpg): The Steubenville, Ohio native became the first Iowa player to earn All American honors for three consecutive seasons, including 1954 when he played the entire year with a broken hand.  The lineman appeared on a 1955 cover of Sports Illustrated and was named the Outland award winner for that season.
     
* [Alex Karras](http://i.cdn.turner.com/si/multimedia/photo_gallery/0910/cfb.heisman.moments.memorable.defenders/images/alex-karras.jpg): Karras played both offensive and defensive line for the Hawkeyes, averaging nearly 60 minutes a game in 1957.  Karras finished second in Heisman trophy voting in 1957 and earned All American Honors and the Outland trophy.  He became a hall of fame offensive lineman for the Detroit Lions and is often remembered for his role as Mongo in the Mel Brooks film Blazing Saddles. 
  
* [Chuck Long](http://espn.go.com/photo/2011/0627/ncf_u_chucklong_cmg_400.jpg): Finished second in Heisman trophy voting in 1985 behind Auburn’s Bo Jackson.  The quarterback finished his career at Iowa with 9,838 total passing yards and 84 total touchdowns. 
      
* [Shonn Greene](http://img.fannation.com/upload/si_blog_post_images/t1_greene1216.jpg): 2008 Doak Walker Award winner after working for a furniture moving company just one year earlier.  Greene earned 100 rushing yards in every game of the 2008 season and was named the MVP of the 2009 Outback Bowl.
    
**Greatest Coaches:**
      
* [Howard Jones](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1302590/Howard_Jones.jpg): 42-17-1 overall record.  Jones coached Iowa from 1916-1923 before moving to USC and developing a dynasty there.  Jones oversaw Iowa’s most recent undefeated season and has the highest winning percentage of any Iowa football coach.
     
* [Forest Evashevski](http://hawkcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/s0910Evashevsk.jpg): 52-27-4 overall record.  Evy coached the Hawkeyes to two victories in the Rose Bowl (the only two in program history) and the 1958 National Title.  Evashevski was also the Iowa athletic director from 1960-1970.   
*  [Hayden Fry](http://i.imgur.com/DRPa1k8.jpg): Probably known best for the coaching tree he started at Iowa. Notable staff and players include: Kirk Ferentz, Bob and Mike Stoops, Bill Snyder, Barry Alvarez, Bret Bielema, Dan McCarney, and Bo Pelini. Fry held a 143-89-6 record at Iowa, coaching for over two decades a ded Iowa to three Rose Bowls.  The coach is also cedited with commissioning the Tigerhawk logo for Iowa athletics, adopting the Pittsburgh Steeler’s esque uniforms, and for being the basis for the popular television character Hayden Fox on the ABC series Coach.  Currently Iowa hosts a yearly festival where fans honor the Hayden Fry in a festival known as Fry Fest.  Typically the Friday before the home opener, the festival features a trade show, concerts, and speeches by both the legendary coach and former Iowa athletics coaches and players.
* Kirk Ferentz: 112-95 overall record. Currently the longest tenured coach in the Big Ten. Ferentz has won two Big Ten titles with Iowa (2002 and 2004) and won the first BCS level bowl game since the 1958 Rose Bowl (the 2010 Orange Bowl).  Ferentz’s recent lack of success has been a source of considerable angst among Iowa fans as the Hawkeyes have failed to record more than seven wins since the 2009 Orange Bowl run.  Further complicating matters is the cost of his buyout, approximately $18.5 million making any discussion of firing him purely academic.  While there is still a sizeable portion of the fan base willing to support Ferentz, his status as head coach will continue to be scrutinized unless the results on the field improve.

*Traditions*
****

 * [The Swarm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKjV-lbsrCY) Iowa’s pregame involves holding hands and simply trotting onto the field behind the I-O-W-A flags as they enter Kinnick. This was implemented by Hayden Fry as a way to demonstrate that the team was unified prior to a game.
 * [The Visitor’s Pink locker](http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Sports/2013/04/05/1iowa-locker-roomsjpg.jpg) room at Iowa was painted pink by Hayden Fry, and since the renovation at Kinnick Stadium in 2006 every aspect of the visitor’s locker room is a garish shade of pink.  The purpose of the color change was supposedly because Fry, who majored in psychology at Baylor, believed that pink was a passive color and that opponents would be lulled into a false sense of security.  Furthermore, Fry also meant to demean opposing players by using a color that was typically regarded as a “sissy” color that was used in little girls’ bedrooms.
 * The night before every Iowa home game current and former members of the Hawkeye Marching Band perform as part of the Beer Band, a non-University affiliated pep band which goes from bar to bar in downtown Iowa City playing fight songs and singing raunchy renditions of other Big Ten fight songs in exchange for free beer.
 * After every victory the Hawkeye Marching Band plays the Hawkeye Victory Polka (“In Heaven There is No Beer”).  The song was originally played after every score but the playing was banned briefly in 2000 as administrators believed that the polka promoted alcohol abuse.  After vociferous protests from students, alumni, and fans the song was reinstated with the stipulation that it only be played after Iowa victories.  No sheet music is used for the song (it was destroyed after the ban in 2000) and band members since the reinstatement of the polka have had to learn the piece entirely by ear.
 * Fry Fest- Every year on the Friday night before the first game, 20,000 fans join together to celebrate the upcoming season. There are often concerts, dinners, fundraisers, and guest speakers (namely Hayden Fry himself) as fans come together to celebrate everything Hawkeyes.
 * Iowa was recently ranked 2nd on the Princeton Review’s top party schools. Much of the reason for this is the tailgates that occur outside Kinnick Stadium and in the numerous bars around Iowa City on game day. Although alcohol is not served inside the football stadium, fans are always sure to get their fair share at any tailgate. Most Iowans are extremely friendly and are always looking for some more people to share a beer with so don’t be shy if you ever come for a game!

**Local Dining:** 

  * [The Airliner](http://iowacityrealestate.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/5694676080_d3f24a5a88_b.jpeg)- One of the oldest bar/restaraunts in Iowa City, the Airliner is known for their pizza (especially buffalo chicken pizza). It is located directly across from the Pentacrest in downtown Iowa City and is often a frequent hotspot the night before games for students and fans alike.
  * [Hamburg Inn No. 2](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jeTdxO5rra8/TqDsUkVF5ZI/AAAAAAAAB4o/atRTelqYheA/s1600/IMG_2674.JPG)- This diner, famous for the Iowa Coffee Bean Caucus during presidential primaries, is home to home cooked American food and their pie milkshakes (actually made with pie) are a requirement for political figures visiting Iowa City.
  * [Pancheros](http://tacotourist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/pancheros.jpg)- The original location of this burrito chain can be found on the southeast corner of the Pentacrest.  It is considered a go to late night dinning option for bar goers but is strong option any time of day.
  * If you come to Iowa City, you have to visit the [Ped Mall](http://cdn3.vtourist.com/4/1570264-Downtown_Iowa_City_Iowa_City.jpg). Tons of places to eat, lots of bars, and there is constantly entertainment. Must visit if you come to town for the weekend.
  * On Gameday, [Big Ass Turkey Legs!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk7fJIY_AQE) are a must have when tailgating. [Chuck Ford](http://www.dailyiowan.com/2011/04/15/Photo/111909-SpotlightTurkeyLeg02-small.jpg) has been doing it for years and is always fun to listen to.

*Random Trivia*
***
* Kinnick Stadium is the only stadium in the country to be named after a Heisman Trophy winner.
* Iowa has gone undefeated four times, the last being in 1922 (7-0-0).
* Since 2001, Iowa is the only team in the Big Ten with a winning bowl record (6-4)
* The 5 buildings on the Pentacrest (literally means ""5 buildings on a hill"") were all former buildings used by the government when the State Capitol was in Iowa City. Those buildings are all currently used as classrooms (outside of the capitol itself)
* The actual Floyd of Rosedale pig was the real life brother to Blue Boy, the pig used in the play State Fair.

*What Is and What is to Come*
***
The Iowa football program is one of the most questionable teams in the country at this point. Although they are projected to finish as low as 11th in the Big Ten this year, Kirk Ferentz’s teams have been known to be at their best when flying under the radar. That being said, the schedule does not favor the Hawks, as they have games at Ohio State, at Nebraska, and home against Michigan and Wisconsin. The team is currently in search of a starting quarterback, with the leading candidates being Jake Rudock and Cody Sokol, though neither of them have played a down of FBS football. Running back and o-line look to be solid as most players are returning as long as they can stay healthy (knock on wood). As long as the offense can stay on the field for more than a 3-and-out every drive like last year, our defense should be one of the better in the Big Ten. As Greg Davis’ offense enters it’s second year, it will be interesting to see if last year’s struggles were just a fluke or if this Iowa team may be headed down a troubling road.

*The Greats*

****

**Greatest Games:**

- 1960 college football season when undefeated and number three-ranked Minnesota met undefeated and number-one ranked Iowa in Minneapolis. The game was for the Big Ten Conference championship, the 1961 Rose Bowl berth, and the #1 ranking. Minnesota won, 27-10.

****

**Greatest Players:**

- **Bronko Nagurski:**

Nagurski became a standout playing both tackle on defense and fullback on offense at Minnesota from 1927 to 1929. In 1929, after leading the nation in rushing with 737 yards he was a consensus All-American at fullback, and despite playing fewer games at the position also made some All-American teams at tackle.

- **Laurence Maroney:**

At the University of Minnesota, he split duties with Marion Barber III in 2003 and 2004 and then with Gary Russell in 2005. As such, he started only 14 of 36 games, but still became the first Golden Gopherand the third in Big Ten Conference history to rush for 1,000 yards in each of his first three seasons. He gained a total of 3,933 yards with the Golden Gophers and was a two time All-Big Ten First Team selection (2004–2005).

- **Marion Barber III:**

Like his father, he played college football at the University of Minnesota where the coaches originally wanted him to play safety, but after seeing him run, they kept him at running back where he ranks fourth on the school's all-time rushing list with 3,276 yards, second with 4,495 all-purpose yards and second in rushing touchdowns with 35, one better than his father, Marion Barber Jr.. He also teamed up since his sophomore year with running back Laurence Maroney to form one of the best duo backs in college football, becoming the first teammates in Division 1 history to each rush for 1,000 yards in consecutive seasons. He was an All-Big Ten selection in 2003 as a red shirt sophomore.

- **Sandy Stephens:**

Stephens was the first black man to play quarterback at the University of Minnesota and remains the only quarterback to take the Gophers to the Rose Bowl (1961 and 1962). In 1960, along with Uniontown (PA) High School teammate Bill Munsey, he led the University of Minnesota to an 8-1 regular season record and the national championship. Stephens became the first African-American major-college All-American quarterback and finished fourth in the Heisman Trophy balloting. In 1961, Stephens received the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the Most Valuable Player of the Big Ten Conference.

- **Tony Dungy:**

Finished his collegiate run as quarterback at the University of Minnesota, ranked fourth in career total offense in the Big 10.

****

**Greatest Coaches:**

- **Bernie Bierman:**

(1932–1941, 1945–1950) Compiling a career college football record of 153–65–12and a 93–35–6 record at Minnesota, Bierman won five national championships and seven Big Ten Conference titles, and completed five undefeated seasons. From 1942-44 he served in WWII

- **Lou Holtz:**

Holtz accepted the head coach job at the University of Minnesota before the 1984 season. The Golden Gophers had won only four games in the previous two seasons, but had a winning record in 1985 and were invited to the Independence Bowl, where they defeated Clemson, 20–13. Holtz did not coach the Gophers in that bowl game, as he had already accepted the head coaching position at Notre Dame. His contract included a ""Notre Dame clause"" that allowed him to leave if that coaching job were to become available. Years later, the NCAA placed Minnesota on two years probation for 17 rule violations, two of which were committed by Holtz during his tenure.

****

**Greatest Rivalries:** 

- [](/iowa) - **Iowa:** [Floyd of Rosedale](http://i.imgur.com/ucdYlBK.jpg), Minnesota leads series 61–43–2

The 1934 Iowa-Minnesota games was one that started a strained relationship that would last decades, During the game Iowa running back, Ozzie Simmons, took hits that he thought were cheap and because of him being one o the few black players of the era. Iowa complained that the Gophers were piling it on, and dishing out blatant late hits in a game that ended with the Gophers winning 48-12. 

The following year, when the Gophers were set to travel to Iowa City, Coach Bernie Bierman received many threatening letters from Iowa fans as a result of the game the previous year. The threats caused Bierman to request police protection for him and his team. The day before the game, Iowa Governor Clyde L. Herring told reporters, ""If the officials stand for any rough tactics like Minnesota used last year, I'm sure the crowd won't."" Herring’s message was clear. “What he was saying was, ‘If you treat Ozzie like you treated him last year, we’re coming out of the stands,’” Simmons said. 

When this news reached Minnesota Bierman threatened to break off athletic relations with Iowa. Minnesota Attorney General Harry H. Peterson practically accused the Iowa governor of thuggery. ""Your remark that the crowd at the Iowa–Minnesota game will not stand for any rough tactics is calculated to incite a riot,"" said Peterson. ""It is a breach of your duty as governor, and evidences an unsportsmanlike, cowardly and contemptible frame of mind.""

To lighten the mood, Minnesota Governor Floyd Olson sent a telegram to Governor Herring on game-day morning, which read, ""Dear Clyde, Minnesota folks are excited over your statement about the Iowa crowd lynching the Minnesota football team. I have assured them that you are a law-abiding gentleman and are only trying to get our goat. The Minnesota team will tackle clean, but, oh! how hard, Clyde. If you seriously think Iowa has any chance to win, I will bet you a Minnesota prize hog against an Iowa prize hog that Minnesota wins today. The loser must deliver the hog in person to the winner. Accept my bet thru a reporter. You are getting odds because Minnesota raises better hogs than Iowa. My best personal regards and condolences.

The Iowa governor accepted, and word of the bet reached Iowa City as the crowd gathered at the stadium. Things calmed down and the game was untroubled. Minnesota won 13-6, and Iowa star Ozzie Simmons played an injury-free game. Afterwards, the Minnesota players went out of their way to compliment Simmons, and Simmons praised the Gophers for their clean, hard-fought play. Minnesota went on to win their second straight national championship.

Governor Herring obtained an award-winning prize pig which had been donated by Allen Loomis, the owner of Rosedale Farms near Fort Dodge, Iowa. Dubbed Floyd after Minnesota Governor Olson, the pig was the brother of BlueBoy from Will Rogers' movie State Fair. A few days later, Governor Herring collected ""Floyd of Rosedale"" and personally walked him into Governor Olson’s carpeted office. 

Governor Olson later offered Floyd up as the grand prize in a state-wide essay-writing contest, which was won by 14-year old Robert Jones. A few years later, Floyd of Rosedale caught cholera and died.

Since the two schools could not continue wagering a live pig, Governor Olson commissioned Saint Paul sculptor Charles Brioscho to capture Floyd's image. The result was a bronze pig trophy 53 cm (21 inches) long and 38 cm (15 inches) high. Iowa and Minnesota have played for the Floyd of Rosedale trophy every year since then. The winner of the annual Iowa-Minnesota football game is entitled to keep the trophy until the following year's contest.
 
- [](/wisconsin) - **Wisconsin:** [Paul Bunyan's Axe](http://i.imgur.com/OQFczvh.jpg)/ [Slab of Bacon](http://i.imgur.com/O21wU6n.jpg). Minnesota leads series 58-56-8

The trophy is a symbol of one of the most storied rivalries in college football, representing the most-played rivalry in Division I-A football, with 122 editions dating back to 1890. The Golden Gophers lead the all-time series 58-56-8, while the Badgers lead the Axe series 38-24-3.

The Paul Bunyan Axe was created by the Wisconsin letterwinners' organization (the National W Club) and would be instituted as the trophy in the series in 1948. The scores of each game are recorded on the axe's handle, which is 6 feet long. The original axe was retired after the 2003 game and a new axe was created for the 2004 game. When the game ends, if the team holding the trophy wins, they run to their own sideline, take the axe and carry it around the field. If the team not holding the trophy wins, they are allowed to run to their opponents' sideline and ""steal"" the axe away. Usually, after the winning team claims the axe, it is custom for the team to carry the axe to one of the goal posts and ""chop"" it down with the axe.

Previously the game was played for the “Slab of Bacon” trophy,.The Slab of Bacon was created in 1930 as a way for the universities to commemorate their rivalry. The Slab of Bacon was a piece of black walnut wood carved with a football topped by a letter W or M, depending on which end it was hung from. It was carved by Dr. R. B. Fouch of Minneapolis. Scores of each Wisconsin–Minnesota game were printed on the back of the trophy. When the trophy changed hands, it was presented to the winning school by a sorority from the losing school.

After the Gophers' 1943 victory, a ceremonial exchange was supposed to take place, but the officials involved could not find each other on the field. Wisconsin sent the trophy to Minnesota's locker room. The Gophers' coach at the time, Dr. George Hauser, refused to accept it, stating he believed ""such trophies should be out for the duration"" (of World War II). The trophy disappeared and was replaced by Paul Bunyan's Axe in 1948.

The Slab of Bacon was missing until 1994, when it was discovered in a storage room at the Wisconsin Athletic Department during a renovation of Camp Randall Stadium. Although allegedly ""lost,"" it had been maintained: as the scores of every Wisconsin-Minnesota game from 1930 through 1970 were evident on the back of the slab.

The Slab of Bacon is currently housed in the Wisconsin football office at Camp Randall Stadium. ""We took home the bacon,"" then-head coach Barry Alvarez said, ""and kept it.""


- [](/michigan) - **Michigan** [Little Brown Jug](http://i.imgur.com/lK7hFxF.jpg), Michigan leads 72–24–3

The earthenware jug, originally used by Michigan coach Fielding H. Yost, is painted with the victories of each team. The name most likely originates in the 1869 song of the same name by Joseph Winner.

After Yost took over coaching the Wolverines in 1901, the team went on to win 28 straight games. In the meantime, Minnesota assembled one of the best teams in school history, so Gopher fans were excited about possibly ending the Wolverines' streak.

As Yost and the team came into Minneapolis, student manager Thomas B. Roberts was told to purchase something to carry water. Yost was somewhat concerned that Gopher fans might contaminate his water supply. Roberts purchased a five-gallon jug for 30¢ from a local variety store.

Twenty thousand fans watched the matchup between the two teams in an overflowing Northrop Field. Minnesota held the fabled ""point-a-minute"" squad to just one touchdown, but hadn't yet managed to score a touchdown of their own. Finally, late in the second half, the Gophers reached the endzone to tie the game at 6. As clouds from an impending storm hung overhead, pandemonium struck when Minnesota fans stormed the field in celebration. Eventually the game had to be called with two minutes remaining. The Wolverines walked off the field, leaving the jug behind in the locker room of the University of Minnesota Armory.

The next day custodian Oscar Munson brought the jug to L. J. Cooke, head of the Minnesota athletics department, and declared in a thick Scandinavian accent: ""Yost left his yug."" Exactly how Munson came to possess the jug is a bit of a mystery. Some accounts say that Munson purposely stole the jug in the chaos that ended the game, although most believe it was accidentally left behind. Thomas Roberts, writing in 1956, stated that the jug had served its purpose, so he intentionally left it sitting on the field.

Still, Cooke and Munson were excited to have this little bit of memorabilia, proceeding to paint it brown (it had originally been putty-colored and currently is painted half blue, which is Michigan's color) and commemorate the day by writing ""Michigan Jug –; Captured by Oscar, October 31, 1903"" on the side along with the score ""Michigan 6, Minnesota 6"". Of course, in the spirit of the moment, Minnesota's score was written many times larger than that of Michigan.

When the two schools met in football again in 1909, Cooke and the Minnesota team captain decided that playing for the jug ""might be material to build up a fine tradition between the two institutions."" When presented with this idea, Yost and Michigan's captain agreed, and the jug thus became the traveling trophy it is today. Michigan took home the jug in 1909 and 1910. Minnesota and Michigan met up again in 1919 after Michigan rejoined the Big Ten Conference, marking the first year that Minnesota won the jug outright.

**Local Dining:**

* [Al's Breakfast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al's_Breakfast) is an icon in Dinkytown (one of the U's neighborhoods): 14 stools, zero pretension, immensely popular. If you want a fancier breakfast, downtown's [Hell's Kitchen](http://www.hellskitcheninc.com/) pre-dates the TV show and features all sorts of great items in a decor inspired by the owner's love of Ralph Steadman's deranged artwork. If you are feeling cheap on a date and you are paying for two, like I was when I went, get the walleye. 

* The [Jucy Lucy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jucy_Lucy), a cheese-stuffed burger, is a Minneapolis invention. Like many cities, there are two places that claim to have invented it: [Matt's Bar](http://www.mattsbar.com/index.html) and the [5-8 Club](http://www.5-8club.com/). Of those two the usual winner is Matt's. The [Blue Door Pub](http://thebdp.com/) does modern takes that are popular, but the best non-traditional Jucy Lucy is actually at [Vincent](http://www.vincentarestaurant.com/) in downtown Minneapolis: the meat is a mix of ground beef and braised short ribs, stuffed with smoked Gouda and served with lettuce, tomato, and a toasted bun (the chef who invented it succeeded Andrew Zimmern at a local restaurant where he made a name for himself before the latter became super-famous)--it's so good the Vincent Burger was [introduced at the Twin's Target Field.](http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20100329&amp;content_id=8981946&amp;vkey=pr_min&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min)

* Other campus hotspots: Mesa pizza is always full on the weekends because drunk people love mac and cheese pizza, I personally think it is overrated. Raising Cane’s has the best chicken tenders on the planet, don’t even argue this until you have had them, I guarantee you will agree. We have a terrific selection if you want asian food. Panda of course, but also a place called Kowloon down Washington toward BK that has much better food and is pretty unknown around campus. Big Ten is awesome as well, with subs that are out of this world. A place called Annie’s Parlor with delicious malts and a view of downtown from their patio. 

* Bars: Sallys and Stubb and Herbs are two great bars on campus. Also, Blarney’s is pretty fun if you are looking for a ton of woo-girls from sororities. We have a bar called the Library on campus, so if your mom calls to ask what you are doing on a Friday night you can tell her the truth and say you are going to The Library.

*Random Trivia/ Traditions*

* There are actually [two large campuses](http://campusmaps.umn.edu/tc/map.php?extent=full) that make up the main University of Minnesota: The Minneapolis (divided into East and West banks) and the St. Paul campus. The stadium and most of the traditional academic buildings are on the east bank of the Minneapolis campus. 

* The U’s Women’s Hockey Team has won 49 games in a row and are the 2 time defending national champions. [link](http://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/streaks-alive-minnesota-womens-hockey-win-49-in-a-row-to-win-title/)

* The “Golden” adjective has not always been a part of the Gopher nickname. During the 1930, the Minnesota football team wore gold jerseys and pants. Legendary KSTP-AM radio announcer Halsey Hall coined the term “Golden Gophers” in reference to the team’s all-gold attire on the field. 

* From 1932 through 1941, Minnesota compiled an impressive record, losing only 12 games and winning seven Big Ten titles and five national championships.

* Ski-U-Mah, This famous Minnesota phrase, pronounced SKY-YOU-MAH, is more than 115 years old. In 1884, two Minnesota rugby players, John W. Adams and Win Sargent, tried to think of a fitting team yell. They used the word “Ski”, a Sioux battle cry meaning victory, and combined it with “U-Mah” (representing the University of Minnesota and rhyming with “rah-rah-rah”) to create a team cheer. The phrase stuck and was incorporated into both official school songs, “Hail Minnesota” and more commonly in the “Minnesota Rouser.”

* For the 2012-2013 season a defensive player wore #51 in honor of Gary Tinsley in every game, Tinsley was a star Linebacker who graduated last year and unexpectedly died of heart problems last summer in his apartment that he shared with Keanon Cooper, one of our team leaders. Ever player also had a GT 51 patch on their jersey for the entire season and we carry out a sledghammer with something written on it in honor of Gary Tinsley (can’t find or remember what) but you can see it in this picture: [In back held by #55 and you can also see Mike Rallis wearing #51](http://i.imgur.com/RonvA3H.jpg)

*What Is and What is to Come*

***

2012 was supposed to be the year of MarQueis Gray, our everything player that started off as a WR but was moved to QB. Arguably one of the most physically gifted players in the B1G the past 2-3 years. MarQueis was supposed to take us to the promised land this year, but injury wouldn’t allow it so he was out for a good portion of the season. He was replaced by Max Shortell, who most Gophers fans despise, Shortell was not productive enough to keep his job so he was also benched and has since tranfered to Jacksonville State University in Alabama. Following Shortell’s underpreforming, the Gophers were forced to play Philip Nelson, a true Freshman that we had hoped to keep redshirted. Nelson preformed at a level better than most true freshman starters you see, but he still has a lot more room to grow. 

[Spring Game Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udSQXnwfgkI)

In 2013 I expect a lot from this team, we have returning starters all over the offense and defense. Our backfield is deep, with Donnell Kirkwood who rushed for ~900 yards last season returning for two more seasons, along with Rodrick Williams who has three more years and has shown great ability that we expect from all the guys we bring up from Texas (Looking at you, /u/Alex_Mayes - btw, get your brother to come to the U and I will love you forever) and Berkley Edwards, brother of Braylon, coming in this year is really a good catch for us. We have also had our first 4 star commit in a while with RB Jeff Jones, hopefully he sticks around (class of 2014) We have a lot of questions at WR with a relatively young and inexperienced group. A guy who I expected to be great, Andre McDonald, has fallen off the radar completely, which just adds to our long running bad luck with promising recruits. Jamel Harbison, who was injured last year, was a stud in the spring game, so hopefully he can spark the passing game. On Defense we have Ra’shede Hageman, who is one of the most intimidation human beings I have ever seen, he has gotten much bigger and stronger since last season (benched 450 and cleans ~350) so hopefully he can do big things. This is the year that I think Minnesota football is going to start preforming at a higher level. We will see what happens though. We are young a LB so that should be interesting to see who filled vacant roles there.

Ski-U-Mah, and fuck the Badgers. Thanks for reading.

*Big 12 Conference*
***
***
**Year Founded:** 1867    

**Location:** Morgantown, WV  

**Total Attendance:** 30,000

**Mascot:** Mountaineers  
  
**Live Mascot:** [The Mountaineer](http://imgur.com/a/Pun3z)   

**Cheerleaders:** [Pictures]( http://imgur.com/a/BwCuU)
   
**Stadium:** Mountaineer Field at [Milan Puskar Stadium]( http://imgur.com/a/wzxmB) - Built in 1980, when the stadium is full, if it were a city, it would be the largest in the state of WV. Capacity of 63,000. Largest ever crowd was 70,222 for a win against #4 Miami in '93, though fire regulation's now would never allow it to get to that capacity again. 

**Stadium Location:** Morgantown, WV - Evansdale Campus  
 
**Conference Champions** (15): Southern Conference (1953,’54,’55,’56,’58, ’64,’65,’67,’88) Big East (’93,2003,’04,’05,’07,’10,’11)

**Number of Bowl Games:** 32 Total, 14 Wins Including 3 modern era BCS wins. We are the only program to be undefeated in BCS games playing in at least 3.

**National Titles** (0) We've been undefeated twice, (88 and 93) and both times played bowls that would've gave us a shot at being named Nation Champions, both times we lost.
***
*Rivals*
***
* Pitt - Popularly known as the ""Backyard Brawl"".  Probably our most heated rivalry, it's not uncommon to hear chants of ""Eat Shit Pitt"" break out at sporting events or even house parties around Morgantown that don't involve Pitt at all. Unfortunately this rivalry seems dead for the time being due to conference realignment. Pitt leads the all time series at 61-40-3, although over the last 30 years the Mountaineers have been 18-9-2 vs the Panthers.
* VT - Another dead rivalry, partially because of realignment and partially because many VT alums and coaches don't want to play in Morgantown. The early 2000s was a great era of this rivalry with close tight fought games and two fanbases that are similar in passion. This game was played for the Black Diamond Trophy which currently resides in Blacksburg. WVU leads the all time series at 28-22-1.
* MD - Maryland is like the kid in the corner of the classroom, he's there but you're not always paying attention to him. We've played MD as long as I can remember and it's usually a good barometer for how either team's season will go. It's close proximity to Morgantown and the large number of alumni in the DC area make road games at MD nearly feel like home games sometimes. This rivalry might also be on it's way out the door to shifting conferences for both teams. WVU leads the all time series at 26-21-2.
* Louisville - I had a hard time making this list without them. We only played them for a short stretch recently when we both were in the BE, but it resulted in some great matchups in football and basketball. Given time this rivalry would've probably got near Pitt level of hatred, as Louisville has a passionate fan base that helps make games against them more interesting. Unfortunately this game too seems to be on the way out due to conference shifting.

*Potential Rivals*

As you can see due to conference shifting WVU doesn't play a lot of it's traditional rivals so some new conference mates that might make good rivals in the near future.

* Texas - obviously one of the top dogs, getting beat up by a team a lot typically boils your blood enough to want to make them one of our rivals.
* Oklahoma - Another top dog in the conference, already had a great game against them, as well as beating them in the Fiesta Bowl a few years ago.
* Oklahoma State - I consider Oklahoma State our most identical team in the Big 12. The fan bases seem similar, historical relevance seems similar and their yearly outlook and recruiting seems similar. I think it could lead to a good rivalry given the right scenarios.     
* Iowa State - Another school that reminds me of WVU a lot. An Iowa St. website dubbed it the Riot Bowl last year due to both schools student populations propensity to riot and burn things.

***
*The Greats*    
****
**Greatest Games:**

* [2003 Virginia Tech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnCe6mc4jt8) – One of the highest ranked teams WVU ever beat, put WVU in the national conscience. 
* [1984 Penn State](http://youtu.be/nV6uGeDGtsE?t=10s) - Penn State was a longtime rival that WVU had a lot of trouble beating. It finally happened in ’84.
* [2006 Sugar Bowl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzK2Dd5sksQ) – Our moment from some gimmicky upstart to a proven team, it also set up the teams that would go on to win the Fiesta and Orange Bowls over the next several seasons. 
* [2008 Fiesta Bowl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VpMxuBYIsk) - Just a month after Rodriguez jumped ship, the team that had been a single game away from going to the National Championship was getting ripped apart, they showed up in a big way.
* [2012 Orange Bowl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCMNIfIlJHs) - Nice kick off for the Dana Holgorsen era, and a third BCS win.
* [1993 Miami](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iJHo6q5n8c) - Largest crowd in Mountaineer Field history, this game was a part of an undefeated 1993 season.
* [1982 Oklahoma](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBulSvgH24I&amp;t=24m30s) - Great win in the early years of the Nehlen era, when Oklahoma was at their peak.

**Greatest Plays:** 

* [Quincy Wilson vs Miami](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoITaaddOTI) - Miami went on to win on a last second FG, but Quincy dicing up what would become an NFL Pro Bowl Defensive roster was amazing.
* [Major Harris vs Penn St](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPX_gAUel8c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6s) - Great play by a great player in a huge game for the program, that season we went on to play for the national title.
* [Grant Wiley Stuffs Suggs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njLlLxmBDIk) - In Virginia Tech's prime, we stuffed them from the 1 for four straight plays and went on to win.
* [Quintessential Pat White](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2mIJqYXAfg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=16s) - Pat had a lot of highlights in his career, this one epitomizes his skill, and the era he was a part of. 
    
**Greatest Players:** 

* [Major Harris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Harris) – Ahead of his time, led WVU to the national title game.
* [Pat White](http://wvustats.com/football/player/2190) – Set all kinds of rushing QB records, Slaton and Pat were the key components to our program making the jump to an upper tier program.
* [Sam Huff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Huff) – One of the greatest players of his era, also had a hall of fame NFL career. 
* [Darryl Talley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darryl_Talley) – Great LB who is now in the college football HOF, was an All Pro twice in his 14 year career, while playing in 4 Super Bowls. 
* [Tavon Austin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavon_Austin) - Obviously he's a hot name right now, but I don't know if anybody has been as unstoppable at times as Tavon was when he was on. His [performance in a loss to Oklahoma](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxzPryPMB74) will go down as one of the greatest performances in Mountaineer history.

    
**Greatest Coaches:** 

* [Don Nehlen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Nehlen) – Brought WVU into consistent relevancy. 
* [Rich Rodriguez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Rodriguez) – Despite his leaving us for the big money, he undeniably started a great era in Morgantown. 
* [Art ""Pappy"" Lewis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Lewis) - Before my time, but led us to unprecedented success and a Sugar Bowl in the '50s.

****
*Traditions*
****

* [Burning Couches](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u0D_L_IhbU) – WVU is infamous for their party atmosphere and have become known for street fires and riots year round but they’re typically ramped up around big football and basketball games.  
* [Country Roads](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs-lrLfPqWU) – The popular song by John Denver has become somewhat of the unofficial song of the state and is sung after home victories.
* [First Down Chant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWe6K-x3M2I) – Not as cool as some traditions, but it is something that’s mostly unique to our school. 
* [Simple Gifts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXkEVWwOIGc) - Iconic pre game show from ""The Pride"" marching band. I had to choose a video of them practicing it since all the videos during the games there was to much cheering from the fans around the camera to hear anything. 

***
*Campus and Surrounding Area*
***

**City Population:** 

* 30,500 in city limits
* 130,000 metro area  

Quintessential college town. Morgantown's population swells to over 50,000 with students in town. Located along the banks of Monongahela River it's a little off the beaten path, but with close proximity to most major east coast cities, Pittsburgh (1 HR), Washington DC (3 HRS), Philadelphia (4 HRS), Cleveland (2.5 HRS) Baltimore (3.5 HRS) NYC (6 HRS), it isn't nearly as isolated as it can seem. Also close to countless outdoor activities in Wild and Wonderful West Virginia. Morgantown is consistently ranked by multiple publications among the best small towns in America. 

**City Skyline**

* [Here](http://imgur.com/a/vyQ8k) - Not a great skyline, and the town is widely spread out, but some good pictures of the town. 
 
**Iconic Campus Building:**

* [Woodburn Hall](http://imgur.com/a/C1DwX)
* [Other looks around campus](http://imgur.com/a/8GiWs)

**Local Dining:** 

* [Mountain State Brewing Co.](http://morgantown.mountainstatebrewing.com/) – Local craft beer, great flatbread pizzas, uses many local ingredients.
* [Mario’s Fishbowl](http://mariosfishbowl.com/) -  A Morgantown staple for decades, this old school hole in the wall is a must visit in town, even if it’s just for a beer or two. 
* [Black Bear Burrito’s](http://blackbearburritos.com/downtown.html) – Not my personal favorite, but it’s so popular around town this list wouldn’t be complete without it. 

***
*Random Trivia*
***

* Bobby Bowden’s first ever D1 head coaching position was at WVU. He had a decent record but after a few years locals were frustrated with a lack of progress and infamously hung him in effigy (according to him) and he left for the Florida State job soon thereafter. He still visits town and him and his sons all have strong ties to the area. 
* WVU is the most winning program in D1 without a national title, they currently have the 14th most wins in D1 history. 
* WVU popularized the read-option that’s now taking over the NFL. Rich Rodriguez and Jedd Drenning created the play on accident while at Glenville State together; Rodriguez kept the play and used it over the years at Tulane and Clemson, before bringing it to Morgantown and finding the perfect pupils to run it in Slaton and White. [This article](http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/9375047) tells some of the background of its creation.
* The [statue of a Mountaineer](http://i.imgur.com/lKUvl4J.jpg) that is located outside the Mountainlair (student union) was based on Jerry West, the legendary WV native and Mountaineer basketball player, who is also the silhouette for the NBA logo.
* The first ever college game to be broadcast on radio was the 1921 Backyard Brawl vs Pitt when KDKA out of Pittsburgh broadcasted it. 
* WVU legendary radio play by play man Jack Fleming was also broadcaster for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Chicago Bulls. He was the play by play man for four Super Bowls and the Immaculate Reception for the Steelers. [Some of his best work](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cifamRWqzE&amp;t=0m24s)

***
*What Is and What is to Come*
***
**2012** ended up being a disappointment, after a hot start to the year, being 5-0 and top 5, we fell off the face of the earth, losing our next 5 as our defense proved incapable of stopping anybody and our offense crumbled under the pressure of needing to score on every posession. We ended the season at 7-6 and went to lick our wounds. It wasn't surprising to me that our first year in a big boy conference had a lot of disappointment, we don't have the depth or the constant stream of recruits that most these teams do. We're working our way into it though and had the 3rd or 4th best recruiting class, depending on the source, in the conference for 2013 and have brought in a lot of immediate help at WR and on Defense.

**2013** should be interesting, our defense should be better, but our offense will almost assuredly take a step back without Geno, Stedman and Tavon running the show. This will be somewhat of a rebuilding year, but I could see with a soft OOC schedule us being around the same record as last year. In either case, with the better national matchups and recruiting in the Big 12 and the innovative mind of Dana Holgorsen I think the future looks bright for the Mountaineers in 2013 and beyond.

***
*Overtime*
***

WVU is a unique University, only a few states have the position where the majority of the state connects and cheers for a single team like here. There's no pro teams, there's no other major Universities (Marshall arguably), this school and state have a special relationship that is unlike many other places, WV is a blue collar state with a hard luck attitude and we seem to get kicked around and beat up in terms of national news and relevance, but the one thing in the state that everyone is proud of is WVU sports teams, and when they're doing good it's like the state is doing good, and when they're doing bad, it's like the state is being embarrassed.

1.  The venue can't be asking for much, if anything.  Most of these stadiums are barely used and stand to profit from any event taking place there from a Bon Jovi concert to a High School football game.  

2.  Corporations love to get their name on stuff like this.  I imagine the Poulan Weed Eater bowl raised tons of cash for Poulan.  

3.  Conference affiliation and guaranteed ticket sales!  Its like making pencils for the government.  No matter how crappy the pencils might be, they have to purchase enough of them that you'll probably already be making money already.

4.  PROFIT!  I read an article in Time where the CEO of the Kraft Hunger bowl took home $400k or 11% of the total bowl revenue.  If the CEO of Walmart did the same thing he would make $44b a year.

*The Greats*	
****

**Greatest Plays and Games:** 

In addition to some of the ones listed above, there have been [plenty of great games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Texas_Longhorn_football_games) where UT won against undefeated, higher ranking foes, made last minute plays to take the lead, and taught Texas fans to never give up until the very last second has past. Here are a few recent ones, with clips.

* [*1969 ‘Game of the Century’ vs Arkansas*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjFMW5uABzA)

&gt;Texas was unbeaten in 18 games and Arkansas had won 15 straight. Texas was ranked #1 by the AP poll and Arkansas was ranked #2. With Texas behind 14-8, Royal instructed Street to pass on 4th and inches. Street rolled left and hit Randy Peschel for the 42-yard gain to set up the touchdown. Two plays later Jim Bertlesen crossed the goal line and Texas won 15-14 in what became known as the ""Game of the Century"". 

I feel like an idiot for missing this one in the initial post. Thanks /u/No_Way_Pablo and the others suggesting this afterwards!

* [*1996 “Roll Left” vs Nebraska*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igWLuCfPnc4)

&gt;An unranked Texas team faced #3 Nebraska in the inaugural Big 12 Championship game. Texas up by only three points faced a 4th and inches call when James Brown rolled to his left and hit Derek Lewis for a 61-yard completion that set up the touchdown by Priest Holmes. Texas went on to win 37-27 and claimed the Big 12's first conference championship.

Great play! Thanks /u/Doonesbury

* [*2005 Rose Bowl vs Michigan*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU3ofrr8Jio)

&gt;Winning an at-large bid in the Bowl Championship Series, Texas made its first ever Rose Bowl appearance against Big 10 champion Michigan. Despite both teams' rich histories, it was their first-ever meeting. Michigan had a 31-21 lead at the end of the third quarter, but Vince Young led two touchdown drives in the fourth quarter. Dusty Mangum kicked a 37-yard field goal as time expired to seal a 38-37 win for the Longhorns.

Our first Rose Bowl win, but not our last! Thanks /u/sammaverick

* [*2006 Rose Bowl vs USC; Vince Young’s Touchdown at 4th and 5*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=s8zZRBTOcnY)

&gt;#2 Texas defeated #1 Southern California 41-38 in the Rose Bowl to clinch a 13-0 season and its fourth national championship. The two teams had a combined 53-game winning streak and USC was playing for its third consecutive national title. Down 38-26 with 6:42 to play, Texas scored 15 unanswered points to win, capped by a 4th-down rushing touchdown by quarterback Vince Young with 0:19 left in the game. Young accounted for 467 yards of total offense. The win marked Texas' 800th all time victory. The game is widely regarded as one of the best games in college football history.

* [*2008 Red River Rivalry vs Oklahoma; Jordan Shipley’s 96-Yard Kick Return*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aLUWAzDAfc)

&gt;#5 Texas went into Dallas to face #1 Oklahoma. Down 14-3 early, Jordan Shipley returned a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown to cut the lead. The game was a back and forth shoot-out between two great quarterbacks, Colt McCoy of Texas and Sam Bradford of Oklahoma. Late in the 4th quarter Texas led 38-35 and faced a 1st and 10 from their own 36 when Texas running back, Chris Ogbonnaya took off 62 yards down the sideline to put Texas in scoring position at the OU 2. Texas went on to win 45-35 and obtain their first #1 ranking in the polls since 1984.

* [*2009 Big 12 Championship vs Nebraska; “Last Second Field Goal”*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZLxsxmBSc)

&gt;Two top 11 defenses clashed as #3 Texas faced #22 Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Both offenses combined for only 308 total yards. Hunter Lawrence hit a 46-yard field goal to seal a 13-12 victory and Texas' third Big 12 title.” 

We ended up beating them at the last second, not only securing a Big 12 Championship and a ticket to the National Championships, ~~but also giving Nebraska a bitter goodbye as they left the Big 12 for greener pastures.~~ but also made us feel better at the end of the night. They were still around for a year (we did beat them their last year, with ironically one of our worst teams ever), then left with OU giving them the boot. Thanks, /u/TeenRacer6 and the million other people who pointed it out. Oops. I must have been thinking about A&amp;M.

* [*2009 Fiesta Bowl vs Ohio State*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSTbhXqk6fk)

&gt;#3 Texas faced #10 Ohio State in the 2009 Fiesta Bowl. This was only the third meeting between the two storied programs with both teams winning once. Texas led 17-6 into the fourth quarter when Ohio State came back to lead 21-17. With under two minutes to play Texas quarterback Colt McCoy led the Horns on an 80-yard drive. Quan Cosby caught a 26-yard touchdown pass for the go-ahead score as Texas won 24-21. This was Texas' third straight victory in a BCS Bowl game and fifth straight bowl victory.

* [*2011 Our Last Lone Star Showdown vs A&amp;M*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBs1T_BRs7o)

&gt;Texas A&amp;M's last Big 12 game and the 118th meeting between the bitter rivals before the Aggies depart for the Southeastern Conference next season was a thriller befitting one of college football's oldest and most storied matchups. Justin Tucker kicked a 40-yard field goal as time expired to give the Longhorns a 27-25 victory over Texas A&amp;M on Thursday night in the likely end of a more than century-old rivalry.
“Texas Fight! Texas Fight! And it’s goodbye to A&amp;M!” 

Thanks /u/sammaverick

**Greatest Coaches:** 

* [*Darrell Royal: 1957-1976*](http://www.sflonghorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/darrell2004.jpg)

&gt;Darrell Royal is the best football coach ever for the University of Texas Longhorns.  Royal, another College Football Hall-of-Famer, was 184-60-5 at UT, leading the Longhorns to 16 postseason appearances and nine victories.  Royal won national championships in 1963, 1969 and 1970, and won or shared 11 Southwest Conference championships.
Royal never had a losing season at Texas, and was awarded the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year award in 1961 and 1963, and was the AFCA Coach of the Year in 1963 and 1969.

The stadium bears his name. He recently passed away this year.

* [*Mack Brown: 1998-Present*](http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_college/files/2010/08/coach_brown_mack.jpg)

&gt;Mack Brown is credited with reviving the Texas football program, and has the track record to prove it.  Brown is the highest salaried coach at a public institution with an annual salary of $5.1 million. On Nov. 27, 2008, Brown achieved his 200th career win, making him the first Texas coach to reach that mark.
Brown has a .796 winning percentage at Texas.  He has had 20 consecutive winning seasons, 18 consecutive bowl game appearances, posted back-to-back 11-win seasons, nine consecutive 10-win seasons and 10 consecutive nine-win campaigns for the first time in school history, though it must be noted that Texas played a maximum of only 11 games per season up until 1975 and only 12 games per season up until 1995 (including conference championship and bowl game).

Brown led the Longhorns to the national championship in 2005 and was the NCAA Coach of the Year.  He is one of the best coached in college football statistically, and will probably find himself as the third Texas coach to be in  the College Football Hall of Fame.”

* [*Dana X. Bible: 1937-1946*](http://img.fanbase.com/media.fanbase.com/8/28142/ee24d7e2a8f4b9dd2a070870d1ec8a1cccb51d3c.jpg?x=549&amp;y=673&amp;sig=a101c7f17196974fa9890f2e356218bc)

&gt;Dana X. Bible is in the College Football Hall of Fame and the Longhorn Hall of Honor for a reason.  Bible was 63-31-3 with the University of Texas, won two postseason games and led the Longhorns three Southwest Conference championships. Although, he was nearly unstoppable at Texas, his most impressive coaching season was at Texas A&amp;M, a season in which the team was undefeated, untied and outscored its opposition 275–0, was retroactively named a national champion by the Billingsley Report and the National Championship Foundation.” ^^^edit: ^^^added. ^^^Thanks, ^^^/u/FarwellRob

*Random Trivia*
***

* [**Pig the Dog**](http://www.texasexes.org/uthistory/traditions.aspx?tradition=pigbellmont)

Before our beloved Bevo, a dog named ‘Pig’ was UT’s first mascot. “Pig was named for Gus ""Pig"" Dittmar, who played center for the football team. Gus was known to slip through the defensive line ""like a greased pig.""
 
* [**The Official School Color dilemma**](http://www.texasexes.org/uthistory/traditions.aspx?tradition=orangewhite)

For a decade or so after UT was founded, there still wasn’t an official school color. The article goes into more detail regarding the rationale behind the choice, but “Attending a football game in 1899, a UT fan would have found his compatriots sporting all shades of yellows, oranges, whites, reds, maroons, and a few in blue.”

* [**The Story and Origins of Bevo**](http://texassports.com/sports/2013/7/28/traditions_0728135205.aspx?id=265) 

Somewhat contrary to the popular belief, past newspapers show evidence of our mascot being referred to as Bevo in 1916 even before the the Texas A&amp;M 13-0 branding of our mascot in 1917. The article details possible reasons Bevo was the chosen name.

*What Is and What is to Come*
***

[Our 2013 Football Preview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSX5l9ZtpgI) sums it up nicely for us.

We showed improvements last year in comparison to the year before and certainly the year before that one. We finally settled in with a single quarterback. Our young team had gotten their feet wet. Longhorn fans had been in want for a few years now after the National Championship game, wondering when the next Vince Young or Colt McCoy was going to take the team by the reins and put the Longhorns back where they have been. This year feels like a make-or-break year. People have been questioning the ability of Mack Brown and the front office to get the Longhorns out of this stagnation. The media’s eyes have been slowly turning away from the team (which may not be such a bad thing, considering all the press A&amp;M has been getting). Longhorn fans don’t like 9-4 seasons and getting destroyed by OU. Now is the time where the team needs to come out with a bang. The team certainly has the potential, and with many more players returning this season, and a more determined and skilled third-year David Ash. During his ‘sophomore slump’ year, he managed to make some improvements in his game and is still improving. Our schedule for next season appears promising, with a decent balance of challenging and ‘esteem-building’ games, filled rematches against teams we lost to last year like TCU, K-State, ...OU. OU is in its rebuilding phase (we cannot take another humiliating blow-out game, or at least, my heart can’t). Let’s have a fun year, with great wins, more memories, less regret, and a rise to greatest once again.

That money was used to pay off our bowl pick 'em winner, since our Amazon money is not available to us yet. $50 went to the bowl pick 'em winner. The other $50 is in my paypal for next year. 

**The winner of the bowl pick 'em has been taken care of. He can post here.**

$10 was sent to our original season pick 'em winner as an amazon instant gift card. We can give him more, but that was all that was originally advertised (this is up to the users).

**The season pick em winner has been taken care of. He can post here.**

From now on each season pick em and bowl pick em will have a $50 prize (as long as we have money). Unless the users would like to change this. I am democratic.

I am the ONLY mod that has access to the amazon link. So no one can run away with the money. Our current ""owed to us"" by amazon.com is $197. There is a holding period. So it takes 3 months to get the money.

You've previously said you met her multiple times! You, sir, are a liar.

EDIT: Full statement, thanks to coooolbeans:


""This is incredibly embarrassing to talk about, but over an extended period of time, I developed an emotional relationship with a woman I met online. We maintained what I thought to be an authentic relationship by communicating frequently online and on the phone, and I grew to care deeply about her.


To realize that I was the victim of what was apparently someone's sick joke and constant lies was, and is, painful and humiliating.


It further pains me that the grief I felt and the sympathies expressed to me at the time of my grandmother's death in September were in any way deepened by what I believed to be another significant loss in my life.


I am enormously grateful for the support of my family, friends and Notre Dame fans throughout this year. To think that I shared with them my happiness about my relationship and details that I thought to be true about her just makes me sick. I hope that people can understand how trying and confusing this whole experience has been.


In retrospect, I obviously should have been much more cautious. If anything good comes of this, I hope it is that others will be far more guarded when they engage with people online than I was.


Fortunately, I have many wonderful things in my life, and I'm looking forward to putting this painful experience behind me as I focus on preparing for the NFL Draft.""

I wanted to let you guys know that tomorrow and Saturday, we are going to be doing AMAs with **12 Heisman Trophy winners**.

We're shooting the [Nissan Heisman House TV spots](http://www.youtube.com/user/nissanusa/videos?query=heisman) for the upcoming season (you may have seen them air before ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC last year), and the Heisman guys will have some down time between takes to drop in and answer some questions. And in case you were nervous, no, they won't only be answering questions about the commercials or Nissan or Rampart.

The actual thread will live over on /r/IAmA, but we'll update this post tomorrow with the link once we're about to get underway. Since the commercial shoot is priority #1 this weekend, we won't have a very set schedule of which Heisman winner will be available at which time/on which day, but we're going to do our best to work as many of them in as possible.

**Here's the list of all the Heisman winners who will be at the shoot:**

* Sam Bradford – 2008 Winner
* Troy Smith – 2006
* Matt Leinart – 2004
* Carson Palmer – 2002
* Ron Dayne – 1999
* Desmond Howard – 1991
* Ty Detmer – 1990
* Barry Sanders – 1988
* Tim Brown – 1987
* Mike Rozier – 1983
* Earl Campbell – 1977
* Tony Dorsett – 1976
* Robert Griffin III – 2011 (Limited time on set, so he won’t be able to join the AMA, sorry guys!)

Ok, that's all for now. Hoping to kick things off mid-morning West Coast time. Be on the lookout for the AMA threads tomorrow and Saturday and start thinking of your questions now!

**Edit to clarify:** There will be one big AMA thread each day, rather than 12 separate AMAs. This should make it easier for people who have questions for the group to get multiple responses, and a lot easier for us to keep track of everything. Also, we're hoping to have half the guys on Friday and the other half Saturday. So, don't lose hope if your favorite Heisman isn't able to stop by tomorrow.

Five months ago a thread about Baylor's brick program for their new stadium resulted in jokes about creating a troll brick in Baylor's new stadium, but among the comments [resulted in a genuine idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/168uhd/so_baylors_new_football_stadium_is_under/c7tt36x). /u/scoote then [suggested organizing an /r/CFB brick](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/169b82/petition_to_buy_a_brick_at_the_baylor_stadium/) and I was asked to organize it.  I'm a lawyer and like to mitigate risk, so [the rules for the official brick fundraiser were detailed](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/16bk7q/rcfb_baylor_brick_fund_donate_now/) and included ""no insulting Baylor"" (because I didn't want to deal with being the contact person for something like that, which would probably fail, instead I wanted to get actual results). Despite some understandable misgivings, particularly from rival fans, we were able to get a serious fundraiser going--because why *not* have a group of college football fans on the internet crowdsource and donate a brick?

***
###The Money, The Message, &amp; The Bonus Donation

Members of /r/CFB were very generous, with **54 donors giving $1,015**! Because I was handling their money, I wanted to be very transparent and democratic. I created a separate private sub so the donors could discuss and vote in a fixed place with only other donors. On the flip side, transparency and democracy do take time, so it took a few weeks (I established week-long voting time periods) to establish, in order:

1. What is the message?
1. What size of brick accommodates the message?
1. What to do with the extra funds?

We had a round of suggesting messages and what to do with extra funds, the nominees of which were later turned into a voting thread. We also had to work with the space limitations of the bricks themselves. The voting on the message split a few ways, but the vote for where to donate extra cash ended up strongly towards a local Waco organization that was suggested by /u/Getsch (a distant second was spit between donating the extra funds to a different brick at another school and the kidz1stFund that Candi Fisher came and did an AMA to promote). 

So here's a quick summary of how the 3 steps turned out:

1. Two different Bible verses with ferocious bears in them split the vote at the top. We went with the verse that led in votes, with the second place verse as a back-up.
1. The verse, even when condensed, required the brick with the most word-space. This actually ended up making it a cheaper brick ($350) as the $500 brick had a large ""BU"" logo that had less text space. 
1. The leftover **$665 went to the [Talitha Koum Institute](http://www.talithakoum.org/about.html)**, a local organization that offers free child care for parents that are actively trying to escape the cycle of poverty, as well as other services like money-managing classes. 

***
###The Delay

The decisions were made 4 months ago and the money was dutifully given to both organizations. Talitha Koum was *thrilled* by the surprise donation and I ended up talking to a few people there as they wanted to know more about how a random, ragtag group of college football fans decided to donate to them. [Their thank you letter even mentions /r/CFB.](http://i.imgur.com/49OC9S0.jpg)

Then there was Baylor. No doubt part of the delay was how the process was organized: 90% of my contact was through the brick company, which is a separate organization that Baylor hired to raise funds and make bricks. To their credit, the Brick Company people were easy to work with, courteous, and eventually helped find out what was causing the delay. Once the brick people received the funds and the message, the message was forwarded on to Baylor in a once a week grouping for approval. Approval was said to take 3-4 weeks. To try and grease the wheels, early on I actually called the donation department at Baylor to tell them the same story I told Talitha Koum: about who we were and how all these different people wanted to donate to Baylor. Well, at the end of the month or so, Baylor got back to us via the brick company: *your message is declined.* 

I can't say I was completely surprised, verse #1 was a little stranger (but not offensive) and my contact person at the Brick Company confirmed over the phone that Baylor just thought it was a little too weird. Thankfully I had verse #2 ready to go so I called up the Brick Company and, yet again, read it character-by-character, line-by-line. Then we waited... and waited... and waited...

[Yes, I decided to keep the final message secret from /r/CFB until it was approved... why? Pure showmanship, I wanted to have a nice big reveal. I didn't anticipate *5 months of waiting*, but at that point I figured I might as well stick to my plan]

I eventually re-contacted the Brick Company and the initially said they believed Baylor had rejected the second verse (uh oh), but no official word had come from them (I wanted an official denial before doing anything). After another month Baylor still hadn't sent an official rejection, so I contacted the Brick Company and this time they confirmed what had actually happened was the second verse hadn't been brought to committee yet (during this time the tragic explosion in West, Texas had occurred so I wonder if that was an understandable distraction). I asked them to keep pursuing it (trying to toe the line between following-up regularly without being a problem) and, finally, this morning I got email confirmation that the second verse was approved. The certificate is in the mail, I will share it when it arrives. 

***
###The Message


    ""Like a bear  
    I will attack  
    and rip them  
    asunder!""  
    Hosea 13:8  
    /r/CFB  

(it will be centered on the actual brick)

###Parting Thoughts

In the end, even with the delays, I would be willing to coordinate another donation drive for another school. Obviously, Baylor works in its own unique way and it was slower than I (or really anyone) expected. We came up with a message that didn't insult Baylor, but was fun and was probably unique while also repping the sub. 

Thanks to everyone who helped make it happen, everyone involved was very patient during the entire process. ",,False,self,t5_2qm9d,False,,usc,True,t3_1g76c7,http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1g76c7/update_remember_the_rcfb_baylor_brick_five_months/,

**Conference Champions** (0): N/a

**Number of Bowl Games:** 4 Wins, 6 Total

**National Titles** (0): n/a

___
*Rivals*
___
 [](/centralflorida) University of Central Florida (aka 'The War on I-4').

We were developing nice rivalries with WVU, Louisville, and Rutgers, but in the current conference configuration this should primarily be UCF, with schools like Cincy, SMU, and ECU in the mix.

___
*2012 Season*
___

**Record:** [3-9](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/_/id/58/south-florida-bulls)

**Coach:** Skip Holtz (now fired)

[2012 Roster &amp; Guidebook](https://admin.xosn.com/pdf8/871983.pdf?SPSID=37319&amp;SPID=2981&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;DB_OEM_ID=7700&amp;)

**Key Players**: Andre Davis, BJ Daniels, Kayvon Webster

**Biggest Plays**: [**2012 SEASON HIGHLIGHTS**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=-l2nQlGQQZ4#t=32s). Our big plays were few and far between. Take note of #81 Andre Davis (WR). He definitely has the potential to be an NFL receiver. He stands at 6-1 and 205 lbs and has some of the strongest hands I've seen.

Last year was a tough year. Coach Skip Holtz was supposed to be the guy that took the program to the next level, but he ended up driving us into the ground. And it couldn't have come at a worse time with conference realignment going on. In 2012, tensions were rising for Holtz to come through, even though it was his third year, and he didn't. The offense was sporadic and the defense was non existent. 

Some people point the finger at BJ Daniels, notorious for having happy feet in the pocket. But he was our best quarterback by far. Once he was hurt in the middle of the year, the season was destined to end bad. 
___
*2013 Season*
___

**2013 Opponents** - 08/31 - McNeese State

09/07 - at Michigan State

09/14 - Florida Atlantic

09/28 - Miami (FL)

Unscheduled Opponents: Louisville, Cincinnati, SMU, UCF, UConn, Houston, Rutgers


**2013 Roster** - n/a

The biggest storylines going into next year will be two things: Who will replace BJ Daniels, our senior quarterback, and how will new head coach Willie Taggart's offense be incorporated this year. He coached under Harbaugh at Stanford and has emphasized that he will have a pro-style offense. This is new to USF because we have always run a spread/qb dive playbook. Unfortunately, the outlook for this year is bleak. The general vibe here is that we will be lucky to make a bowl game.  Our defense last year only had 2 interceptions. 2 interceptions. In the whole season.

___
*The Greats*
___

**Greatest Games:** A win against #17 Auburn in 2007 really set up a magical year. Our program was 10 years old, so this was a very exciting ""we can do this"" moment. Later that year, we upset #5 WVU to propel us to **#2 in the country!!**. #13 Kansas in 2008, #18 FSU in 2009, and #16 Notre Dame in 2011.

**Greatest Plays:** Grothe to Hester to win in OT at Auburn in 2007. Ben Moffitt pick-6 vs. WVU at home (Raymond James Stadium was on fire) [Video highlight here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=H_tdb-hGetc#t=125s)

**Greatest Players:** Jason Pierre-Paul (you're welcome, Giants), Consensus All-American George Selvie, Marquel Blackwell, Matt Grothe, Mike Jenkins (current Cowboy CB)

**Greatest Coaches:** Jim Leavitt (now SF 49ers LBs coach) founded the program and built it from trailers to bowl games

___
*Traditions*
___

Our program is young, so we lack the kinds of things other programs have passed from generations past. However, we do know how to party:

Tradition 1: Giant-slaying. From beating ranked teams as an independent, to coming to Notre Dame in 2011 and winning, we are a team you will lose to if you overlook us.

Tradition 2: [The Beef Studs](http://image.cdnl3.xosnetwork.com/pics11/640/YE/YESGXXTMIJVQYNU.20090608182156.jpg), our rowdy, body-painting student fan club attends all games and often show up in the hundreds to most sporting events.

Tradition 3: Drunken rides on the BullRunner (campus shuttle) to games on a sunny Florida day

Tradition 4: Our water tower gets lit green when we win, and a [skyscraper downtown](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2078/2210854190_d84e27d8e1_z.jpg) goes green for all games.

___
*Campus and Surrounding Area*
___

City Population: 346,000. Metro population: 2.8 Million [**City Skyline**](http://tamparealestateinsider.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/tampa-skyline-dusk.jpg)

Iconic Campus Building: [**Brand new Marshall Student Center (biggest in FL)**](http://web.usf.edu/nrotc/nrotc/images/MarshallCenter.jpg). Complete with rideable bull statues

**Local Dining:**

One thing that all Tampons love is Taco Bus, a local Mexican eatery that has grown from a single location to 5! Just ask anyone in /r/tampa.

Tampa is known for great bars, international cuisine, and seafood. Mr. Dunderbaks is a German beer house that is also very popular on campus.

___
*Random Trivia*
___

1. We were going to be the Buccaneers. That name won a vote in the 60's narrowly, but was dismissed due to the belief that another school was using it at the time. The second-place name? The Golden Brahmans, to honor Florida's cattle industry. This name evolved into the Bulls over the years.

2. We are called the University of South Florida because at the time of it's founding, the school was the southernmost public university in the state.

___
*What Is and What is to Come*
___

One of the most special things about USF is the way many fans view the program as their child, in a way fans of bigger programs will never experience. Every time something good happens with this football team, it is all for the first time. Many alumni funded and led the program's inception in the late 90's. When you watch a program go from a dream, to playing in DII, to joining a BCS conference, to winning on some of the biggest stages in college football, you develop a closeness that is indescribable.

Our program has struggled badly to get over ""the hump"". We have bright spots and big upsets, but have yet to win 10 games, or even come close to winning our conference. With a new head coach in Willie Taggart, who put together a top-50 recruiting class, we hope we get our swagger back and get over the hump.

___
*Overtime*
___

1. We are a respectable 8-9 in out-of-conference BCS games since joining the Big East, 9-9 if you include Notre Dame. Since the program began, it took 104 AP Polls before USF showed up in one, the quickest of any program. USF has a 60/40 female:male split.

2. Once known as a commuter school, USF now houses 82% of incoming freshmen on campus. We are considered a major research university, being in the top 50 in research expenditures (mostly health-related). You'll find the most passionate fans at The Bulls Pen

*Rivals*
***
* [](/virginiatech): **[The Commonwealth Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Cup)**. Our biggest rivalry, against our perennial opponents in the South, and the last game of the season. Played right around the Thanksgiving break, Tech leads the series 52-37-5, and leads the trophy series 14-3, ever since the trophy began being awarded to the winner. It's our second longest game series (the longest being below's UNC rivalry), but it's the one that gets our blood pumping and brings out the worst/best in us as football fans. After that humiliating shutout a few years ago, when we had just broke the rankings at #24, it led the way to a humbling end of our season loss to Auburn in the Bowl game. Many hope to attend UVA during a year we win that game, and last year we came close, losing by 4.
* [](/northcarolina): **[""The South's Oldest Rivalry""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%27s_Oldest_Rivalry)**. The longest football series in the ACC, this series is very close with UNC leading overall 59-54-4. The last few years have been going UNC's way, but UVA has a 20-9 record since 1983. We hope to break their small streak before it continues and even the series up.
* [](/maryland): **[The Beltway Brawl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland%E2%80%93Virginia_football_rivalry)**, UVA has been winning more of the last 6 or so, with Maryland winning the most recent game, and leading the series overall 43–32–2. Recent students had the privilege of attending the last blowout game in Charlottesville in 2008.
* [](/floridastate): Non-annual rivalry game, the **[Jefferson-Eppes Trophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson-Eppes_Trophy)** is awarded to the winner. Florida State leads the series 14-3, but UVA currently holds the trophy thanks to a nail-biting finish to the 2011 game in our best season in years.
* [](/clemson): Non-annual, I think Wikipedia says it all: *""Virginia took 30 attempts to beat ACC foe Clemson, which sparked a rivalry.""*

*The Greats*    
****
**Greatest Games:**

1. [Florida State in 1995](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByCwrGBfJek), when UVA beat then-ranked #2 FSU on a late goal line stand to hand the Seminoles their first loss in ACC conference play since joining the league in 1992. (Both Tiki and Ronde Barber played that game)        

2. [#14 UVA def. #9 Clemson 20-7](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/949575-uva-14-fsu-13-and-the-ten-greatest-victories-in-cavalier-history/page/13) in a game that would start out march to be ranked #1 in the nation after going 7-0. [Video 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fWcZAcQV_M) [Video 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAC9NKaR5B0)

3. [UVa beats in-state rival VirginiaTech and Frank Beamer](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/949575-uva-14-fsu-13-and-the-ten-greatest-victories-in-cavalier-history/page/11) after the greatest comeback in school history. *Down 29–7 at the half, we outscored the Hokies 29–3 in the final two quarters. We capped its historic rally with a [game-winning 47-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Brooks to wide receiver Ahmad Hawkins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuekLDVJ7vg) with 2:01 left to play.*

**Greatest Plays:**

1. [Tiki Barber 65-yard run](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ByCwrGBfJek#t=24s) to put us on the board against #2 FSU.    

2. After completing a game-tying drive to even the score, Georgia commits an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and kicks off from the 20, resulting in [Allen taking it 83 yards to win the game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=DuEqL4V-XI8#t=618s).

3. UNC had just gone up 17-3, and were on our 5-yard, poised to score. Then, [Antwan Harris intercepts the pass](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=w-sEIwdKF7M#t=29s) and returns it 90?/100? yards for a pick-six. After that, UVA didn't let UNC score for the rest of the game and ended up winning 20-17. *Edit*: Sorry for the shitty video quality :(

**Greatest Players:** [Tiki Barber](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBIMZbH6s70), Ronde Barber, Matt Schaub, Heath Miller, Chris Long, D'Brickashaw Ferguson, Ahmad Brooks, Herman Moore, Henry Jordon     
**Greatest Coaches:** George Welsh, Frank Murray
****
*Traditions*
****
* Probably our most well-known gameday tradition: ""Guys in Ties, Girls in Pearls"". When UVA first started participating in college football, it was an all-male school. Football games were seen as a social event, and as men are wont to do to impress others, they wore dress shirts, slacks and [blue and orange] ties. They would also bring their girlfriends to these games, and the girls would wear sundresses and pearl necklaces (weather permitting). The attire evolved over the years to include the occasional blazer, Sperry boatshoe, and of course, the ultimate sign of being a man, a bow tie. However, the premise for the tradition - men wearing ties and women wearing pearl necklaces - remains, even in this ""COLOR OUT"" era.

[Bonus picture of some fans wearing ties and pearls.](http://i.imgur.com/lYlGmzP.png) [(pfs3w - I'm the guy with the obscenely orange glasses :P)](http://i.imgur.com/lYlGmzP.png)

* We refer to our campus as *Grounds*.

* Pre-Game: [The Adventures of Cav-Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=zkI2g-bQ-jM) (**WARNING:** the speakers go really loud at the end of the video!), digital short on the jumbotron involving Cav-man slaying that week's home game opponent (usually harassing students somewhere on Grounds). He then enters the stadium on Sabre (the horse) while Thunderstruck or ZombieNation plays.   

* We have a fight song, but after every score and game, we sing the alumni song *The Good Ole Song*, in which we all join arms. The song has [gained some notoriety](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Old_Song) in past years after students would add to the lyrics ""We come from old Vir-gin-ia, where all is bright and gay"", by chanting ""NOT GAY"". A petition successfully stopped this practice, and now we chant ""FUCK TECH!"" in reference to VirginiaTech instead. You can find the song [HERE](http://fightmusic.com/acc.html) if you search ""Good Old Song"".

*~~Campus~~ Grounds and Surrounding Area*
***
**City Population:** 43,375  
[**City Skyline**](http://www.readthehook.com/files/news-sunrisedowntown-m_0.jpg)   
**Iconic Building on Grounds:** [The Rotunda](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/University_of_Virginia_Rotunda_2006.jpg): Our most iconic building, and the biggest architectural draw we have, aside from *The Lawn* on which it stands. Was formerly a library in the University's oldest days, it burned down in 1895, and was restored in the years following. Now, it serves as a cornerstone of Jeffersonian architecture, and the face of the University. [IMG 2](http://i.imgur.com/IZoSYB3.jpg) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rotunda_(University_of_Virginia)    
**Iconic Location on Grounds:** [The Lawn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lawn) is our large grass court at the base of the Rotunda, which extends all the way down our Academical Village. During the warmer temps of the Spring and early Summer, it is often filled with students relaxing on the grass, sun bathing, studying, or playing the occasional game of Ultimate Frisbee.   


**Local Dining:**

* [The Virginian](http://www.brobible.com/college/article/100-best-college-bars-bros-2/page-2), known as ""the Virge"", is a popular [sports] bar on an area just outside of ~~campus~~ Grounds that we  call The Corner. #26 in the Brobible's top 100 college bars.

* Bodo's Bagels on the Corner. Hugely popular, school tradition insists that you get the first ticket at Bodo's, so people camp out at ridiculous hours of the night just to be first in line when it opens.

* Marco &amp; Luca’s on The Corner for the best dumplings you'll probably ever have.

* If you are a college bro type, check out Little John's NY style deli after hours on the Corner, and try the Chris Long sub or the 21 Society.

* Fine dining can be found everywhere at [The Downtown Mall](http://www.visitcharlottesville.org/visitors/restaurants/).

*Random Trivia*
***
* UVA is the only college campus to be a designated *UNESCO* World Heritage Site.

* The original College was architected by Thomas Jefferson, whose original buildings can be seen in the area we call *The Lawn*. The Rotunda building was originally a library.

* Maryland's grass thing is the only grass lawn larger than our own, by less than a foot. (Someone will probably post the actual metrics and prove me wrong)

* Wake Forest Head Coach Jim Grobe played football at UVA. Our greatest coach, George Welsh, was an assistant under JoePa at Penn State.

* There is an acclaimed but unproven game of football that occurred just two years after the historic Rutgers-Princeton game that started college ball.

* The last time UVA held a series lead over VT in the Commonwealth Cup was in 1960, and the current drought goes back to 2003, when Matt Schaub and Heath Miller played on the team (additionally, we've only won 1 of the last 15).

* UVA was involved in a controversy in 2002 at the inaugural Continental Tire bowl against West Virginia, when during the halftime show, the now extinct independent pep band staged a rendition of ""The Bachelor"" with two contests: one being depicted as a well-educated UVA woman and the other as a ""bumpkin"" WVU woman.

*What Is and What is to Come*
***

&gt; Mike London came in with the intent of changing the attitude toward recruiting and player development from the way Al Groh was running the program. London has placed an increased emphasis on recruiting in-state talent (with great success). I think when London first came on as head coach, many were willing to wait several years (or at least until he had several years of recruiting his own players) to judge his success as a coach. Following a pretty lucky 8-4 campaign two years ago, expectations rose among the UVA fan base. What followed was a pretty mediocre season last year. UVA had one of the youngest secondaries in all of college football last year, and the inexperience on defense combined with underwhelming offensive production (particularly in the ground game, where we returned several good running backs and an offensive line with at least two potential first rounders) led to a poor record.

&gt; Unfortunately in this coming season, UVA will be facing an extremely tough schedule with a crossover division game against Clemson and OOC games against BYU and Oregon (and a not as bad as you might think Ball State team). A bowl game would be considered a victory in my mind. There still is hope for the future, as UVA continues to recruit well. It also will be interesting to see how the new coaches/coordinators impact the success of the team. I just don't see how with these new coaches and still relatively young team that UVA has a winning record in the 2013.

###Program details:

**The /r/cfb Baylor Brick Fund is a GO!**

Some of use here at /r/cfb have decided it would be fun to donate towards a brick at Baylor's new stadium ([details on the program here](http://www.baylor.edu/stadiumbricks/)).

###**Ground Rules**

I think it's helpful to have the basic rules so no one is later disappointed and we can all be on the same page:

* We will not be trying to insult Baylor with the brick's message. The fact that a mix of alumni from throughout the country have donated a reddit brick is kind of unique and bizarre on its own. Witty messages are fine, but if it would cause Baylor to reject the tile if they figured it out, why bother with this?  I just want to avoid obvious or hidden obscene messages or insults that would get the tile rejected outright. Basically, I need to be able to credibly defend the message if it gets questioned, I'm results-oriented.

* There won't be room to put any usernames on the brick, it will be a general message from /r/CFB --no matter what message is chosen, it will be only from /r/CFB.

* People who donate will get to have ultimate say on what we write on the brick (suggestions welcome from everyone, including non-donors).

* The base amount for donation is $10. If you want to donate more, you may. 

*  To be fair to those who donate more, in determining what the Brick's message will be, each donor will be given one vote per $10 they donate (or half-vote for $5). The message will be determined by majority of donor *votes* (50%+1). Yes, theoretically someone could just donate a ton of money and determine what we say--so long as the message isn't something that will violate the ""no-trolling"" clause and is only a message from /r/CFB. 

* The brick prices go all the way to $1250. If we go over a particular amount, but fall short of another brick, the extra funds will be donated to the whoever the majority of *donors* (not donor votes) want. Popular ideas have been rolling funds into another brick fund, donating to charity or helping add to /r/cfb prize money. 

* The funds will initially go to *my WePal account* and I will donate those funds to Baylor. I will do my damnedest to be transparent about where the funds are and how much we have. 

* There is no hard deadline at the moment, but I'll put a soft deadline as Friday, January 25. We can see where we are then.  

My hope is we can use this same model if the idea ever comes up again in the future. 

###**Payment Selection**

My goal was to find a payment service that offered the least restrictions and the lowest fees (so more of your money will go to the brick). After looking through a variety of sites (including PayPal, Indiegogo, and GoFundMe), I decided to go with WePay. WePay offers the least restrictions (e.g. we don't have to meet a set goal), and low rates if we either set up a donation buttons *ourselves on our own website* OR *invoicing*. Since I don't have a website ready to go, I am going to do the invoicing option. 

###**How to Donate**

If you want to donate to our **/r/cfb Baylor Brick Fund** please use the following steps:

* [**Send me a Reddit message**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Honestly_) with (1) the amount you want to donate and (2) your preferred email address (you could post it here, but I don't recommend it as I might miss it and it will throw your email to the wolves)

* I will use WePay to invoice you at the email for that amount, which you can pay with either credit card or bank account payment. WePal's fee is 2.9% + 30¢ for credit card payments or 1.0% + 30¢ for bank account payments, so if you pay via bank account we will get more of your donation. 

* I will update this post with the usernames/flair of those who've successfully donated, along with the amount they donated. I will respect requests for anonymity on username, but I will list anonymous dollar-amounts as well so everyone knows where we are in total amount. 

* Finally, I'll do my best to keep the list of donors and amounts updated at least once a day, but please be patient. I don't foresee any hang-ups, but I should say that. If you don't see yourself listed after paying, or you have other concerns, please contact me and I will do my best to keep you in the loop.

*Rivals*

***

* [](/tcu) **TCU** (Revivalry) - Our oldest, and some might say ""deepest,"" rivalry. TCU was the second school that Baylor ever played in football, the first being the illustrious football powerhouse Toby’s Business College. We first faced off against each other on the gridiron in 1899 where we ground down to a 0-0 tie. More than a hundred games later, the series stands at 51-50-7 (with the slight advantage being held by the Frogs^(so close)), making this game one of the oldest and most even rivalries in all of college football. The rivalry extends past the football field as well, as the two schools shared Waco from 1895 to 1910, when TCU packed up shop after the administration building burnt to the ground. Popular urban myth holds that it was a bit of Bear Arson that led to the move. The rivalry runs deep on both sides.

* [](/texastech) **Texas Tech** - Baylor’s rivalry with Texas Tech is full of bitterness and hatred on both sides. Whenever these teams meet, the rules seem to not matter so much, and multitudes of penalty yards are accumulated on both sides. Unfortunately, this hatred often extends into dirty plays, from Women’s Basketball phenom Brittney Griner’s falcon-punch on Texas Tech’s Jordan Barncastle to Texas Tech’s targeting of Robert Griffin III’s head during his Heisman season. This series is also very close, currently at 36-34-1 in favor of Tech. ^(Not again.)

* [](/texasam) **Texas A&amp;M** (Battle of the Brazos) - The Baylor – A&amp;M Rivalry is another example of bitterness, but the overall series in the Battle of the Brazos is quite lopsided. This rivalry is notable for its various pranks, which included the repeated defacing of buildings with the opposing teams and the repeated stealing of Baylor’s mascot. The overall series is currently 31-68-9 in favor of A&amp;M.   


***

*2012 Season*    

***  

**Record:** [8-5-0](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/schedule/_/id/239/year/2012/baylor-bears)    

**Coach:** Art Briles       

**Key Players:**


* [**QB Nick Florence:**]( http://www.baylorbears.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/florence_nick01.html) Breaker of Records and Sporter of Beards, Nick Florence had bigger shoes to fill than any quarterback in Baylor history, but he answered the call by breaking RGIII’s passing yards record.  He took the mantle that Griffin left behind and did us proud.  What else is there to say?


* [**WR Terrance Williams:**]( http://www.baylorbears.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/williams_terrance00.html) T-Dubs was nothing short of uncoverable during his time here at Baylor.  He was a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award and an absolute terror on the football field.  Also, he was the receiver who caught the game winning pass against OU during RGIII's Heisman season.


* [**RB Lache Seastrunk:**]( http://www.baylorbears.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/lache_seastrunk_772741.html) As quick and explosive a running back as you’ll find in college football.  He says he’ll win the Heisman, or at least get close, and he absolutely has the talent to do it.


* [**DB Ahmad Dixon**]( http://www.baylorbears.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/ahmad_dixon_713352.html) Ahmad Dixon has been the starting Nickelback for the Bears’ defense for the past two seasons.  This year, Ahmad will make the switch to the Strong Safety position, a move that will hopefully enable him to flourish and show his coverage skills.  Dixon has been a bastion of stability on a defense that has made its name on being just the opposite.

*The Greats*    

****

**Greatest Games:**


* [2012 Baylor v #1 KSU]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgpxT4c9su4): Baylor’s first ever victory over a #1 ranked opponent. This victory came at a time when no one expected Baylor to even making a bowl game, as the only conference win we had was against Kansas. This started a season-end drive to bring our record up to 7-5 and led us to the Holiday Bowl against #17 UCLA.


* [2011 Baylor v #14 TCU]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmb6H8Kapto): The game that began the Heisman season.  This was a classic if there ever was one.  I remember the chants of “Heisman! Heisman!” that rang out through the stadium; no one in the stands knew that those chants would be answered.


* [2011 #22 Baylor v #5 OU](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15r3q0jnQzc): This was the game to end all games.  Rushing the field after this game is probably the highlight of my collegiate career.  The pure joy after watching the strike to Terrance Williams that won the game was completely incredible. This was the first time Baylor had defeated OU and was one of the many great games that defined the 2011 season, dubbed ""Añodeloso"" or ""Year of the Bear.""


* [1974 Baylor v #12 Texas](http://www.texassports.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/stats/74/ut-bay.htm) - In the game that was the pinnacle of what was known as the ""Miracle on the Brazos,"" Grant Teaff lead the Baylor team from a 24-7 halftime deficit against Texas to defeat the team for the first time in 17 seasons. This led to the Bears winning the SWC Title, denying Texas the title for the first time in 7 years.

  

**Greatest Plays:** 


* [“The Immaculate Deflection”]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT34mwhaZMg): RGIII’s Heisman season, like most Heisman seasons, was predicated on a decent portion of luck as well as skill, and this was about as lucky as it gets.


* [Terrance Williams catches the game-winner versus OU]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMm2qGMGV8Q): I freaking lost my mind when I saw this happen. I’ve already mentioned this play plenty in this writeup, and for good reason.  There is no doubt that this was RGIII’s Heisman moment.


**Greatest Players:**


* [LB Mike Singletary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Singletary): The original Baylor legend.  “Samurai Mike” Singletary holds the highest tackle total in Baylor history with 662 career tackles, which is TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY MORE than 2nd place on the list.  Just stop and think about that for a second.


* [QB Robert Griffin III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griffin_III): RGIII.  You might have heard of him.  He was at the core of the Baylor football revival over the past few years.  And oh yeah, he kinda won the Heisman Trophy. At Baylor.


* [RB Walter Abercrombie:]( http://www.baylorbears.com/genrel/abercrombie_walter00.html) Abercrombie played for the Bears from 1978-81, his career overlapping with that of Mike Singletary.  He is Baylor’s all-time leading rusher, and did Baylor proud by running with gusto every chance he got.


* [FS Thomas Everett]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Everett): A truly incredible defensive back, Everett played for the Bears from 1983-86 and won the inaugural Jim Thorpe Award as the best Defensive Back in the country.  Everett went on to have an illustrious NFL career and started on the Dallas Cowboys’ back-to-back Super Bowl winning squads.


* [QB Don Trull](http://www.baylorbears.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/050713aaa.html): Two time winner of the Sammy Baugh award, All-American, 4th place finisher for the Heisman in 1963 (which is the best any Baylor player had done up to that point). He is a part of the 2013 College HoF class (as the linked article mentions).


* [P Daniel Sepulveda](http://www.baylorbears.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/sepulveda_daniel00.html): What? A punter you say? Punter's usually don't get a lot of talk, so I thought I'd throw him in here since he was a pretty notable player in recent years. Two-time winner of the Ray Guy award (first time a punter the award twice), two-time All-American first team, fourth round draft pick to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Also, [check out this tackle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FhCgLeuO0I).

    

**Greatest Coaches:**


* [Grant Teaff] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Teaff): The All-Time winningest coach in Baylor Football history.  He led the Bears to 2 SWC titles and 8 bowl games during his career.


* [Art Briles]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Briles): Architect of the Renaissance of Football in recent Baylor history, Briles has turned Baylor football into something it hasn’t been since the Grant Teaff Era.  He brought RGIII and a high-octane offense to Baylor that has been turning heads.  Now, he needs to continue this success, and if he does, he could secure the position of the undisputed greatest coach in Baylor history.


****

*Traditions*

****

* **Baylor Line** - The Baylor Line is the embodiment of Baylor's spirit. The Line is made up entirely of freshmen who, before the game, [run across the field](http://i.imgur.com/B1F4YKW.jpg) and greet the team by [forming a tunnel on the field](http://i.imgur.com/b5iGJAC.jpg). The Line sits next to the band in the student section, at the front between the 20 and 40 yard lines ([the empty section in this photo](http://i.imgur.com/zKnKJ9V.jpg)). Each member of the Line receives a yellow jersey with their graduation year on it at *Line Camp*, a week during the summer where incoming freshmen learn the traditions and cheers of Baylor. They also have the option to customize the name on the back of the jersey.

* **Immortal Ten** - On January 22, 1927, the Baylor Men's Basketball team was on a bus heading down to Austin to play UT. The rain made the drive difficult for the bus driver, and in Round Rock, as the bus passed over railroad tracks, a train struck the side of the bus. 10 of the 22 players and fans were killed in the wreck. One man, James Kelly, pushed his friend out of the way of the wreck at the cost of his own life. The accident shocked the entire nation. Each year, during homecoming, [the Immortal Ten](http://i.imgur.com/omhXOso.jpg) are remembered. 

* **Homecoming** - Baylor has the oldest college homecoming tradition in the nation [according to historians](http://www2.baylor.edu/baylorproud/2012/10/baylor-homecoming-to-be-featured-in-upcoming-smithsonian-traveling-exhibit/), starting in 1909. Every year, Baylor holds many events including one of the oldest homecoming parades (with a [giant bear balloon](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/97/Baylor_homecoming_parade.jpg)), a bonfire, etc.


* **Diadeloso** (yes, all one word like that) - This is a pretty unique tradition to Baylor. ""Dia"" started in 1932 as a way to ""bring smiles to the faces of students"" by giving them a break from classes. Sometime in April, on a Thursday, classes will be cancelled and activities such as tug-of-war, beach volleyball, etc will take part on campus. For those who don't want to partake in university sponsored events, there's also ""Dia del 10th Street"" off campus which is essentially one big frat party.


* **The Eternal Flame** - To honor the memory of the Immortal Ten, Baylor lights an Eternal Flame at the beginning of Homecoming Week, only putting it out once the celebrations have ended. In the early years of the Flame, students from Texas A&amp;M (as mischievous as they are wont to be) thought it would be a good idea to put out the flame, causing Baylor students to rise to defend it. As the years went on and Aggies stopped coming, the tradition morphed into Freshmen guarding the flame against upperclassmen. Upperclassmen employed various strategies to put out the flame, including water balloons, spies and brute force. Freshmen would form concentric rings around the flame, with students taking shifts in the rings to guarantee that the flame was guarded 24/7. In 2007, guarding the flame became so hazardous, with students getting pelted with urine-filled balloons and others being sent to the hospital, that the tradition of guarding the flame was cancelled.


***

*Campus and Surrounding Area*

***

**City Population:** 124,805  

**City Skyline** - [Not much to see](http://i.imgur.com/M2CqcHn.jpg), but most important is the [ALICO Building](http://i.imgur.com/TubCXYy.jpg). ([For those wondering why it's so desolate](http://youtu.be/Gsh46wQsz7M))   

**Iconic Campus Buildings:** 


* [Pat Neff Hall](http://i.imgur.com/vdDN7NZ.jpg) is our most iconic building and is usually the first thing I look for as I drive on I-35 towards campus. It houses a [48-bell carillon](http://youtu.be/MmQcoQu0wzY) and usually go off every 15-minutes to remind people of the time. Although, it's not uncommon to hear someone playing short tunes in the afternoon. I've heard our school song, Christmas songs, and the National Anthem, depending on the occasion.


* [Baylor](http://i.imgur.com/8WyJMpp.jpg) [Science](http://i.imgur.com/ik8qAFI.jpg) [Building](http://i.imgur.com/6QGsEHm.jpg) (BSB) - This building is pretty new, but it's awesome. Important note: the BSB and the SLC (the student gym) form a [bear paw when looked overhead](http://i.imgur.com/QTljeTX.jpg).


* [Old Main/Burleson](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d6/Old_Main,_Baylor_University.jpg) - As the name implies, it's one of [the oldest buildings on campus](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Baylor_University_1892_front.GIF).


* [Carroll Science Building](http://i.imgur.com/OwEuTxL.jpg) - Home to our English classes. Seriously, it is. It's not really iconic, but I just like pointing out that fact to people.


* [Armstrong Browning Library](http://i.imgur.com/gdo20Jn.jpg) - Not our main library, but it houses the largest collection of secular stained glass in the world. Not only that, the interior is [absolutely beautiful](http://i.imgur.com/cM3l3nM.jpg), making it a popular wedding venue. I hear the waiting list is two years long, which sort of leads to a mentality of ""get the venue first, get the guy later.""     


**Local Dining:**


* **Vitek's BBQ** - Home of the [Gut Pak](http://i.imgur.com/XRyDDbc.jpg), which won the Cooking Channel's college eats bracket this past year. There's a reason it won...it's absolutely delicious (as gross as it looks). It comes in two sizes, small and large. A friend of mine describes eating a large Gut Pak perfectly: ""You eat it, then about an hour later you take the biggest dump of your life. Then you sleep the rest of the day. And it's glorious.""


* **George's** - The chicken fried steak might be famous in the region, but you have to try the Crazy Wings: chicken, stuffed to the gills with cheese and jalapeños, wrapped in bacon and deep fried to golden delcious-ness. The bar is a favorite of Pat Green, who [featured it in a song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxwVE_EGy7M) of his.


* **Kitok** - If you're not sure if you have a hankering for Korean food or a tasty burger, you need to go to Kitok. Owned by white guy and his Korean wife, they have some of the tastiest burgers in town for a *good* price. Try one with their asian fries and you won't be disappointed.


* **Shorty's** - Near campus, Shorty's has quickly become a popular spot with Baylor students. It has one of the best slices in town and Thursday night's feature $3 half-pitchers of anything on tap (*helloooo* Shiner).


* **The Dancing Bear** - The Bear is best known as a quiet bar with some great beer on tap but you can also get food delivered from the next-door restaurant (Food for Thought). This is the best way to do it because Food for Thought is run by smelly hippies (in the literal and figurative sense) and you can get beer at the Bear.


* **Jake's Texas Tea Garden** - This is a recent addition to Waco fare and it has quickly proved to be a great one. Their burger's are top-notch, their fries are freshly cut and their desserts are homemade (seriously, minstrels will sing praises about Jakes' banana pudding centuries from now).


***

*Random Trivia*

***

* Baylor University is the oldest continually running university in Texas. As it was chartered in 1845, the charter comes from the Republic of Texas, not the state.


* The 2011 season is often called ""[The Year of the Bear](http://www.baylorbears.com/yearofthebear/)"" or ""Añodeloso."" Not only did Baylor have a breakout year in football with a 10-3 season and RGIII winning the Heisman, Man Bear's BB made it to the Elite 8, Lady Bears won the NCAA National Title and became the first team to win 40 games in a season. Overall, the Bears went 129-28 (.822) in the 4 major collegiate sports (FB, MBB, WBB, Baseball), breaking the NCAA record for a single season.


* The bear mascot actually came through a vote among the students. Some of the other options nominated were buffalo, eagle, antelope, and bookworm^(God help me). The bear won by a tad bit over half of the votes cast. Baylor has kept live American black bear mascots since the first one arrived in 1917. Each bear since 1974 has been named ""Judge"" with a nickname based on an important person in Baylor's history. The bears are trained to do a Sic 'Em (our hand gesture) and even used to [drink Dr Pepper](http://i.imgur.com/nDP9WLf.jpg), but this has since stopped. The Bears reside on campus in a habitat that is deemed a Class-C zoo, making it one of the only zoos that resides on a college campus
