Just because Brady is always smirking around in fancy hats and Belichick looks like a disgruntled little wizard (these cannot be denied). And because you win. A lot. Is that so wrong?

I mean look at that score over on the right. 52 to 28? with the turnovers you had? You made my team look like a joke. And decided to do it in presumably the hardest way possible. The **only** thing the Bills D had done right before the game was stop the run effectively. It's like Belichick went in the locker room and said ""it'll be too easy if we beat them with Brady. Let's see if we can run it too"". And he did. For over two hundred yards. Without Mankins. Belichick turned our Dline into swiss cheese.

And Brady? He speaks for himself. Got over 300 yards against our D easily. Working with one limited tight end and a WR squad which had questions surrounding it before the game. He makes his teammates better in a way that almost nobody in the game ever has before. Constantly pulling it off with WRs that are under 6'. Constantly pulling it off with zero running game and often zero defense. Ridiculous.

I came here to say this.

And yes, I'm an actual Bills fan (born and raised next to Buffalo), not one of you just looking for Karma. I have no idea how to prove it.

My kindly wife usually gets me some kind of Lego set (because she's AWESOME), and my kid gives me a hug. Both of these usually suffice, and I will gladly receive both of these gifts with great joy and happiness.

However, this year, I'm asking for something from you guys as well. I have been a great fan throughout the years, and nothing would make me happier on my birthday weekend than for you guys to kick the ever-loving shit out of the Jaguars.

So, Brady...do your ""pissed off that I lost last week, so now I'm going to take my anger out on you"" Brady thing.

Welker...break out the stickiest pair of gloves you've got and catch a thousand passes for a million yards. I expect this to be done by halftime. 

Mayo, Spikes...break some faces.

Arrington...whatever comes most naturally as you play cornerback, do the exact opposite.

Thank you all in advance for what I anticipate to be a wonderful time of ass-stomping.

(*sarcasm*)

Terrell Suggs, Baltimore Ravens linebacker:

""These are the most arrogant pricks in the world starting with Belichick on down.""

""Tell them to have fun at the Pro Bowl. Arrogant F---ers.""

""That's funny, ever since SpyGate they haven't been able to win.""

And then apparently he calmed down:

""All BS aside they are a hell of a ball club ... They have the right to be arrogant.""

Classy. (*sarcasm*)

Really, people hated on Belichick for not giving a post-game interview, but I suspect it might've been a 'if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.' This probably sounds childish to some, but I think it's respectful, and I like it. 

A reporter asked Deion Branch what he though about Suggs' comments, and I think his response is spot on: 

'“I don’t know. I think,” said Branch, before a long pause, “they won the game. I’ll leave it at that. Champions carry themselves a little different. If you talk to Ray (Lewis) it might be a little different. If you talk to some other guys, they are champions. That’s not how a true champion talks, regardless of whether you win or lose. It just doesn’t work that way. But congratulations to the Ravens.’’'

Thank you Deion, for exhibiting the Patiot's Way, and, in general, some class. Something that seems to be lacking in a few of Baltimore's players (looking at you Ayanbadejo.)

Congratulations to the 49ers and Ravens.

It was great making GDTs with you guys this season. I never thought this would be the last one of the year, and Im crushed that it is, but I still had a blast. Thank you for participating with me. 

Dont let the haters get you down. Theyre just sneering cynics. We still got to enjoy a highly entertaining season, and a more successful one than fans of 29 or 30 other teams.

I will be hanging around a bit to watch the Superbowl and off season. I'll see some of you guys then, the rest of you in August. Have a great spring and summer.

It was 31-3. We were dead in the water. But you know what? We fought. We clawed and ground our way back into that game, against all odds. Once we figured out what they were doing, we carved one of the best defenses in the league up like a turkey. Of course, there was a lot of bad too. The first half just didn't go our way, and we got burned a few times. But that happens to the best of teams. What separates the best teams from everyone else is their ability to get back on their feet. Did the Texans fight like us? I think not. And this was WITHOUT our biggest red-zone threat. Get Gronk back, and we will be, in my honest opinion, unstoppable.

So, we probably lost our bye. It sucks, but big deal. So we might have to deal with another team on our way to the superbowl. We can take them. No one save the Broncos truly scares me in this conference, and we just took one of the few teams in the league that DOES intimidate me down to the wire once we stopped screwing ourselves over. We play that game again and we WIN. We WILL win in February! 

TL;DR- We fought and fought hard. We may have come up short, but there's plenty of football left to play, we're getting BETTER, and soon we'll have Gronk back! So smile pats fans, we hung with the best, and if we keep this up, we'll have another problem on our hands...

That man is Tom Brady, whose offspring shall one day lead an offense on the field of Gillette Stadium to throw 4 TD games on what was known before they met the Brady as the most formidable defense in the game today.

Tom Brady, a man who runs for first downs, bangs his gorgeous supermodel wife, makes Zoolander model babies who have cannons for arms (even Vivian), and turns defenses into his prison bitch (or the New York Jets, whatever same thing). JJ Swatt? More like where the fuck were you on that pass rush as Brady RUSHED FOR A FIRST DOWN SON? Be it Welker, Hernandez, Lloyd, or Stalworth ye shall receive a perfect spiral of a completion, and ye shall be so enamored by the awesomeness of a throw that you received that you go 15 on a carry and an automatic touchdown, because FUCK YOU Brady threw that, that's why!

I shall speak of the villains the NY Giants who stabbed America in the back TWICE, making Bald Eagles cry on Brady's behalf in withholding the two Super Bowl Rings from the RIGHTFUL GORGEOUS HANDS THAT IT BELONGS TO! **OK PAUSE ON THE BRADY TRIBUTE** How in the living blue hell can you call dopey ass Forrest Gump looking Eli Manning an Elite QB when the fuckin dude literally just chunks the fucking ball and his RECEIVERS come down with that shit. I mean literally TWO defining plays of the Super Bowls by that man have been chunked balls that were lightning striking twice yet it is brother of the TRUE RIVAL OF BRADY who got none of the strategic talent but two of the Super Bowls! OH that helmet catch was bullshit (YES I AM A PATRIOTS FAN, BUT YOU GUYS DIDN'T HAVE TO RUN IT UP YOU BULLIES, ok I digress). **RESUME BRADY TRIBUTE** Yet Sad Brady becomes Mad Brady and shows the world why the Patriots are the better team, in the better city, with the better food that holds great QB's with great looks and WR's now in the new 2012 edition that includes a running game and not other franchises with overrated University of Florida QB's named Tebow a very exclusive club of sucking.

The immortality of Tom Brady is well known. Even now as this tribute is being written private scientists hired by Bob Kraft are developing the jar head technology from Futurama in order to preserve Supreme Overlord Head Coach Bill Belichick and Tom ""Who Needs Gronk when you got Pass Precision like this"" Brady's place in the Patriots franchise.

You were everything that we thought you guys were and we are sorry that our team did not show up to play against you guys. We will see you in the playoffs hopefully.

There was a rumor the reason they were doing this was to see how quickly defensive coordinators get in their signals so they could figure out which teams were more susceptible to the hurry up offense.  This could have easily been done by pen and paper.  That's why when Kraft asked belichick how much of an advantage it gave the team, belichick said it was barely anything and kraft called him a fool (which i agree with).

""It's funny how people think the Patriots knew the other team's defensive signals when a) they're changed at half time and after every game. Getting signals by video taping is impossible. You only have 12 minutes at halftime (Source http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/timing) to go back to the locker room, to rewind the tape, and go through an hour and a half of tape trying to decode signals, and by then, it's probably too late. At the end of the game, forget it, there's absolutely no way in hell teams keep the same signals for their next games.
You have to do it in real time to steal signals, and even then it's probably too late when you get into half time:

Brady vs. the league's best QBs in TD to INT rate since 2007. Astonishingly better than Peyton than I would have thought.

* **Brady**: 177 TD vs 40 INT - **4.43 to 1**
* **Rodgers**: 158 TD vs 43 INT - **3.67 to 1** 
* **P. Manning**: 148 TD vs 66 INT - **2.24 to 1**
* **Brees**: 203 TD vs 91 INT - **2.23 to 1**
* **Roethlisberger**: 130 TD vs 61 INT - **2.13 to 1** 
* **Romo**: 146 TD vs 74 INT - **1.97 to 1** 
* **E. Manning**: 143 TD vs 96 INT - **1.48 to 1**  

It's worth mentioning that Brady and Manning would be closer to (and better than) Brees in terms of total TDs if they hadn't missed full seasons due to injury. And Rodgers wasn't full-time starter until 2008, so his numbers are over roughly the same number of games as Brady and Peyton.

**STORY**

Regardless of my views on his fashion sense, Tom Brady showed this week that he is, *sigh* once again elite. However ridiculous his Uggs look, he could've been wearing 10-inch heels and it wouldn't have mattered given how little he had to move in the pocket. His throws were veritable lasers flying across the field. His mere walking upon the field caused the British's women to cry out of despair; his perfect teeth melted their delicate sensitivities. Seemingly taking after Colin Klein in Morgantown, Handsome Tom committed felonious arson in his torching of the Rams defense. Add in assault for his tearing up of our secondary, and he has suddenly racked up quite a rap sheet across the pond. Even while sitting on the bench his presence inspired the previously porous Patriots defense to morph into a Pro-Bowl quality unit. By whipping his golden locks back on forth He divinely pushed the ball into the hands of a waiting defender. It seemed that Saint Brady, as he shall be forever called, was not human; rather, he was but the Holy one's blessing upon Heathen Europe. Step aside, Mr. Tebow - your true savior has arrived.

**POEM**

Oh Tom, you turn our defense to jelly

I can't even stand t'watch on the telly

Picking and pecking, snipping and snapping

Our defense into shards - while they're clapping

We call quarterbacks like you MVPs

Oh wait, I forgot, you're still 5-3.

Just thought I would share a little of what I know about Nate with you guys, as I consider you lucky to have drafted him. As you probably know Nate is one of the best rugby players in the country for his age. His father and my father played on the same rugby team ""back in the day"" and where pretty close friends. I'm sure you also know that his father was tragically murdered some years back as someone tried to rob one of his scrap yards. Mr. Ebner's murder hit my dad pretty hard, but because of the personal relationship my dad had with him I have followed Nate very closely throughout his OSU career. (I am also a die hare Buckeye faithful) His father's murder was a major factor Nate to walk onto the football team at OSU. Though he had little football experience he worked his way to being one of their most valuable special teams players. My dad told me that before every rugby game Mr. Ebner would enthusiastically remind the team to ""Finish Strong"". Which Nate turned into one of the main sayings throughout the OSU locker room during his time there. Many of the players even wore red wristbands that said ""finish strong"" on them in several games. He may never be a star in the league, but I definitely think he will contribute to your team. I wish the Browns had the chance to snag him, but obviously we had far more needs to be addressed. This is a slow period as far as NFL discussion goes so I just thought I would try to give you some insight into a draft pick you may not know much about or particularly like. He's definitely the type of player and worker that every coach loves to have on their team.

I remember having only been a fan for a couple years in 97 when we lost to the Packers.  I was in a house full of people who wanted nothing more than to see the Patriots lose.  They got their wish.  That event really sealed my love for this team.  We then had the amazing run of the 2001, 2003 and 2004 seasons.  Being a fan and watching your team become a dynasty is a very rare experience.  Watching them go undefeated in the regular season in 07... Wow.  Only one other group of fans have experienced that, and even then it wasn't the same.  Then to watch your team go all the way and lose.  I did not talk to anybody for three whole days after that.  Then this Sunday...
The point here is this:  We, as Patriots fans, have experienced the highest of highs and the lowest of lows over the last couple of decades. No other fans can claim to have gone through what we have, and even though every other fan base have their own unique facets, I remain convinced that fans of the Patriots have experienced football in a profoundly different way.
So, even though this is a decidedly uninteresting rant, after this weekend, thinking about all this may not have made me feel better, but it did even more to cement the passion for my team.

Anybody want to throw some thoughts down about subreddit improvements? Thoughts? Suggestions?

Me personally, I'd like to get the mods in here and see who is active.  I would definitely enjoy weekly threads where we all get to chat and bs about Pats stuff during the season(or bi-weekly now that it is off-season).  I'd also like to see more flair for other ""visiting"" teams(or any flair at all?!).

Anyways..2013 looks good for the Patriots as a team as usual.  Not easy to make it to a championship game after a tough SB loss in any respect.

Feel free to chime in...I'd like to see the community more active.  Also I'll stop spamming submissions :).

All over the internet, I see people bashing NE players and coaches alike. Everybody is saying the defense sucks (which they kind of do,) and the offense is misfiring (which has happened all too often,) but we just beat the jets, at home, in a thrilling game. 

It seems to me this was more like a patriots team of the glory days--before we were blowing people out by double digits every game. I don't remember too many blowouts during the super bowl winning years; what I do remember were the players shining in the big moments.

Just like Ninkovich against the Jets. That was a true Patriot performance, making plays when it matters most. And on the defensive side to boot!

Also, look at Bill. That man is a giant. Can you imagine the pressure and stress he is under this season? You can see the joy, and the relief, in his face. 

That picture, to me, sums up the Patriots, fighting and gutting it out like the team hasn't had to in years. 

I realize there are lots of problems to fix, but shit, lets have some pride about being Patriots. Back in the good ol' days, we gutted out our fair share of wins; instead of just ripping into the Pats, lets take a little pride in coming out on top in a tight game. 

Sorry for the rant, needed to get that out.

He's incredibly consistent and durable. He has been a pillar in extending the reign of Patriot dominance. He's also one of the best slot receivers ever. He's a perfect player in the Patriot system. He's had great success and there's a bunch of teams that would pay through the nose for him. And the man needs to get paid.

The problem is he's worth too much. He's 31, he's small, he's had acl surgery, his role requires him to take gigantic hits. He's not playing into his late 30's, there's a good chance that he has 4 years left at the most. 

To pay Wes his market value, combined with his potential for risk just goes against everything the Patriots do. They did this to Wilfork, Mankins sat out, Branch, BJGE, the list goes on and on - it doesn't matter how good you are as a Patriot - you must accept less money.

Wes knows this. He knows it's not fair. And the Pats don't want to lose him. But they know it may happen. So they're bringing in as many guys as they can to illustrate to Wes that they're serious about this. Bring in the former Patriot favorites also serves as a reminder that the Patriot system is good for everyone, but that means you have to buy into the system.

This is basically a staring match between the front office and Welker. They want to keep him but don't know if he'll accept terms. They need to find a way out.

And that, sportsfan, is why we have 11 WRs on the roster.",,False,self,t5_2rx57,False,,retro-helmet,True,t3_taba0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/taba0/fine_ill_say_it_the_pats_have_11_receivers_to/,

Although I live smack between DC and Baltimore now, there's a reason I bleed red, white and blue. Growing up, words like Yankees or Jets were absolute blasphemy. While I admit, as a very young child I had a slight fondness for the 49ers, there was never any other team worth rooting for. My grandfather taught me the ways of the New England Patriots. He explained that they were a different kind of organization and a different kind of team, one that was going places. 

I got to watch him be right about that, which has always involved happy memories.

Now, however, I am far from the bitter mid-winter Nor'easters. I am long removed from familiar sights like Duck Tours and the T. I live in a place where if you aren't bleeding burgundy, you're bleeding purple- and if you aren't doing that you're the enemy. Between DC and Baltimore is a unique area where two teams are the local team, but if you're rooting for anything else both Ravens and Redskins fans alike will shun you.

And that's before they find out it's the Patriots you're die-hard for.

The endless taunting of whether or not Tom Brady is into chicks is easy to ward off at first. Believe me, the Uggs promoting didn't help things- but fortunately Tom Brady is an easy guy to defend. Hot wife, huge house, legendary quarterback. When your QB is Rex Grossman or Joe Flacco, the ""Tom Brady sucks"" argument never goes very well.

But alas, walking into a bar around here rocking the blue, silver and red is no walk in the park. More often than not I get surrounded by a suffocating purple cloud telling me how if it wasn't for Billy Cundiff... and losing that superbowl was tough around here. I barely got a chance to absorb it before the Ravens began to circle, cawing about how their team would have decimated the Giants. Snooze.

But it isn't all bad. I can't say there are a lot of Patriots fans around here, other than the occasional guy with a Brady jersey who knows we won ""a few superbowls"" and doesn't know who Aaron Hernandez is. There are, however, similar animals. People who root for the Titans, or the Broncos, even the Giants. Where normally I would jeer a Giants fan, here in Maryland we have a suspended respect for each other. While we might not care for each others teams, we know what its like to be islands in a burgundy and purple sea.

I even high-fived a Jets fan. Once.

I still regret it, though. Gross.

Anyway, the next time you are at a bar in Boston, or even somewhere in Connecticut or Vermont- consider your brethren in the other parts of the world. The guys fighting the good fight in the bowels of New York City, or out on the coast amongst Raiders fans and Seahawks fans. I might not live near the sacred ground of Foxborough any longer, but I consider my jersey a tiny little piece of it. Even from Silver Spring, Maryland- Sunday is Patriots day.

Anyone else have stories about being a Pats fan outside of NE? I'm sure New York has to be the worst place, but I always wonder about fans from random parts of the country- or even outside the US.",,False,self,t5_2rx57,False,,nelogo,True,t3_y5igg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/y5igg/how_i_feel_as_a_pats_fan_outside_of_new_england/,

Tebow's residence in heaven turns out to be a modest house with a few hedges and a nice walkway.

Tebow turns around and sees that there's a gigantic mansion across the street. It has a pool, several balconies and nice cars. Furthermore, the mansion is adorned in Tom Brady paraphernalia. The whole building is painted Patriot colors, the number 12 is mowed into the lawn, the cars all sport the number 12 on their hoods, and Tom Brady's face is blazoned onto the wall of the pool house.

Stunned, Tim Tebow asks Jesus why Tom Brady has a better house than he does.

Sure I'd played Madden before and knew that the Patriots had a pretty accurate QB and a good passing game, even if the run game wasn't great (this was Madden 10). 

By the time the 2011-2012 season started, I became a Patriots fan. Slowly but surely, I learned everything I could about the team. I couldn't get enough of the Patriots. I've seen ""Bill Belichick A Football Life"", read ""Patriot Reign"" and done my best to absorb everything Pats related. My first live NFL game was the Patriots vs the Rams at Wembley Stadium in London last season and it was simply amazing to watch Brady sling the ball to Mallet on the sideline.

Right now, a lot of us are down. We've lost our best receiver to Peyton Manning, and I'll admit that I was initially enraged. But look at the big picture. We've been working to get more balanced on offense and by letting Welker go, we've got the money to retain Vollmer. Pair him with our TE-Party and you have a stellar running game. We may also be able to retain Talib.

Furthermore, this draft is pretty deep at a lot of positions. I have no doubt that Belichick plans to trade down at least once to stockpile a lot of picks and help our team. 

We may have lost Welker but we have the greatest coach and QB in the league bar none. There's a reason everyone calls Belichick a sith lord, it's because they're all scared of him. He finds a way to get rid of our best players and not miss a beat. 

Denver may have collected a deadly arsenal of receivers but their run game is average at best. When it's time for the playoffs, all the pressure will be on Manning to sling the ball. All it'll take is one mistake, and even though I have a ton of respect for Manning, he's had a lot more mistakes in the playoffs than Brady. 

If we end up in the AFCCG against Denver, I wouldn't be surprised if Kyle Arrington had the game of his life and managed to defend Welker. I'd be thrilled, ecstatic, I'd probably want to go riot and get wasted. But I won't be surprised. Because Belichick probably drew it up like that.

I wish Wes Welker all the best with the Broncos. He gave us more than we could have asked for. But when we host Denver this season and see Welker at Foxboro decked out in white, I hope we make him spend the rest of his life regretting his decision to leave us. 

We are the New England Patriots. We don't do business like the rest of the league. We will have the last laugh.",,False,self,t5_2rx57,False,,pat-patriot,True,t3_1a8tbt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/1a8tbt/we_are_the_new_england_patriots_dont_forget_it/,

^ Video of Bob Kraft, owner of the Patriots, seconds after the hail mary fails.

This transcends football. All season long, he didn't publicly say it, but he could feel it. This team had something special. A spark, an air about it, a mysticism with it's 2 tight end sets and offensive firepower. This whole season, dedicated to his wife he loved so dear, wanting nothing more than to win her a Super Bowl, a final thank you to a woman who did so much for the team, the community, and the world. This season wasn't about touchdowns or breaking records, this season was about Myra Kraft and winning the super bowl for her. The Pats came so close, less than minutes away from storming the field, holding the Lombardi high, pointing to the sky, and saying ""This one's for you, Myra. We did it. For you."" 

That's all this guy wanted. To bring a final wish to his late wife in the form of another super bowl. I think that's what hurts the most. The blown catches, the near misses, Eli's final drive, all of that doesn't matter. What cuts the deepest and cuts the sharpest is the feeling that they didn't get it done for her. Caught on the .gif is the exact moment he realizes the season is over, and that is the reason I can't bear to watch this .gif more than once. Thank you Myra. Thank you Bob. Thank you Patriots.

Rest in Peace, Myra. We'll be back next year. ",,False,self,t5_2rx57,False,,,True,t3_pl2h4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/pl2h4/on_the_subject_of_the_saddest_football_image_ive/,

I have a few different reasons for supporting the Patriots, but I'll get to that later.

On the rare occasion I state that I'm British in /r/nfl with my Pats flair, usually there's a comment from someone stating that I'm stupid, or asking if I see the irony in my fan support. Sometimes it's just a light hearted joke and others a genuine question.

I find it interesting that it's always supporters of other teams that do this, and before today, not a single Pats fan had ever approached me about it.

Today was the first time someone with a Pats flair did, however.

In a few years you guys will have to start making the moves to eventually replace him. After the Colts debacle last year, I'm sure you all know how important it will be to get a new QB and give him some time to train and grow under Brady, so when do you see your team making a serious first round pick at a QB to succeed arguably the greatest QB of...well...all time? Is there anyone in the college game now that Patriots fans have their eye on? How much confidence do you have in your front office and Belichick to take the team into the next era?

I'm honestly curious because Ben probably won't last as long Brady, so I could see us being in the same boat shortly after you guys are.

Anyway, in the video, Brady threw a bullet pass right through the middle without ever seeing the ref and it smacked him right in the face.
