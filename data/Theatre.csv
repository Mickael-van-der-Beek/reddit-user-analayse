Well about a year and a half ago I came back.  I joined a local community theater and got cast in everyone of the childrens shows for the season and I had a blast.  I met new people I grew more confident.  Since then, I have branched out slowly.  I have done the occasional reading of a script at other theaters (I live in Houston.  theres pleanty of places to audition), but have remained solidly entrenched in my home theater making children giggle.  

Well, recently, I was asked to direct the next childrens show.  the show is The Emperors New Clothes by Michele Vacca.  I agreed and I have spent the last three months planning this.  Making decisions about lights and sound and costumes and sets.  Getting covered in gold glitter spray paint and smelling like wood stain.  I have cried and I have been frustrated and I have never been so proud in my life.  We have had our share difficulties.  Last Monday, with three rehearsals until we open, one of my actors dropped out for questionable reasons.  By the grace of god, I was able to find someone who fit right in and is amazing. 

At the same time, at the urging of my friends and boyfriend, I auditioned for another show at a different theater.  This show is very adult and emotionally vulnerable.  Im a talented actress, but Ive never felt confident enough to be truly vulnerable.  Yes, the reason my Eeyore is so entertaining is because hes so much more than a sad donkey. But I was terrified to wear my own clothes.  With regular makeup, and get onstage and make a genuine connection with the audience and my fellow actors.  This rehearsal period has been terrible.  There were times when I was convinced I should drop out.  Times when I just knew I was letting everyone down.  But last night, at rehearsal I finally found her.  And I have never been so proud of myself.  

On Saturday, we open the Emperor's New Clothes and on Tuesday we open Okay, Better, Best.  I could not be more proud of myself.  I have grown as a person.  I pushed myself right to edge and I didnt fall off, and I have proven to myself that I am capable of so much.  So whether or not the shows are commercial successes, it doesnt matter because I already won.",,False,self,t5_2quc9,False,,,True,t3_19nooe,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/19nooe/i_have_stepped_outside_my_comfort_zone_and_won/,

I've wanted to share this with Reddit since I got in the show but we got some really good reviews this week so Reddit won't think I'm doing this to sell tickets, they're selling anyway!

I'm from England and moved to NY to study in 2008.  Since leaving school this is my first big production and I wanted to share my excitement and offer this subreddit some discounts for providing me with all the news and discussion I needed on the community for so long!  I'm not a big role but it means a hell of a lot to me to be a part of it.

The code works until the end of July 8th.  Please let me know if anyone is coming!  I'd love to grab a drink after the show!  Also, if you can't make it in June but still want to come the let me know and I'll see if there are any offers available in July.  There are also student rush tickets available 2 hours before showtime.

	Look at this stuff. Isn't it neat?
	Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
	Wouldn't you think we're a school
	A school who has ev'rything?
	
	Look at this trove, treasures untold
	How many wonders can one main stage hold?
	Looking around here, you'd think
	Sure, we've got ev'rything
	
	We've got spike tape and gaff tape a-plenty
	I've got birdies and source 4s galore
	You want scale rules? We've got twenty
	But who cares? No big deal. I want more
	
	I wanna be where the smart lights are
	I wanna see, wanna see 'em movin'
	Movin' around on those
	Whaddya call 'em? Oh, yolks
	
	Spinnin' your wrench, you don't get too far
	Bolts are required for tiltin', panin'
	Lightin' along down that
	What's that word again? Stage
	
	Up where they mix, up where they run
	Up where they act all day as the sun
	DMX free, wish I could be
	Part of that world
	
	What would I give if I could live
	Out of my budget?
	What would I pay to spend a day
	Warm in the lights?
	
	Betcha on plan they understand
	Bet they don't reprimand their workers
	Bright electricians, sick of sittin'
	Ready to stand
	
	And ready to know what designers know
	Ask 'em the questions and get some answers
	What's a gel? - and why does it
	What's the word? Burn
	
	When's it my turn?
	Wouldn't I love, love to explore
	The lights up above?
	Out of the spot 
	Wish I could plot 
	Part of that world

So I was wondering if we should work together to come up with some form of super archive.
Perhaps divided by age? Classical and contemporary? Not sure. Comments? Suggestions? 


EDIT: GROUP SUGGESTIONS 

Well I think if we had as a subreddit it would be easier to control rather than a GoogleDocs/an FAQs. Also it means we could reach out to other theatre related subreddits because I know they receive a lot of unwanted posts of similar context. It would just make over all traffic flow.

idledebonair (one of the moderators for r/theatre) said he/she would it in the sidebar. So we would have direct traffic from r/theatre. 


What's everyone thoughts of expanding it to Duet scene, group scenes and recommended plays?

Looking through the comments it seems that every posts title should look like this: **Genre(comic/dramatic), Age range, title of show** Then with in the post, authors name, the page number/act and scene,  a quick play synopsis and character synopsis. Thoughts?

In the theatre world everyone keeps their monologues locked away. As if it were there own intellectual property. So I love the idea of our community helping each other and expand our art. Please this is a work in process and all your help is freakin appreciated and welcomed. I want this to be a group idea. 


EDIT: 

Alright guys! I've done my best to take in everyones ideas! 
Introducing! [r/monologue](http://www.reddit.com/r/monologue)
With the help of r/TheoryOfReddit we thought it was best to go with a subreddit!
We understand that it may take sometime to get the kinks out and come up with the best formatting possible. With all of us together we can make one sick ass archive, to help us with future auditions! There is a test post  there now to see if anyone has any suggestions!
Hope this works! and again we are always open to recommendations!

We few, we stupid, stupid few have chosen to follow our dreams and leap into the unreliable performing world.

And in this world from time to time you meet the occasional civilian who feel it's their responsibility to tell you ""how hard it is."" and preach to you about gospel you've been studying for years. ""yeah if you want to be a starving artist"" they'll say with a smug tone spewing from their lips. 

And you, you will smile at them.

While our work is hard, while the jobs are scarce, while only a handful of us will be working actors, know that you were brave.

When that civilian dreams, they don't ponder about becoming an accountant, they're dreaming of doing something beyond normality. But instead they play it safe, they aim for security and domestication, not what they want to do. Which, in it's own way, is fine. 

But we few, we happy few, have decided to try. We have decided that this life is better spent trying and failing, than watching and waiting

So next time you don't get the part, when someone better looking is chosen over you, when you haven't worked in two years, know that you're trying to chase down your dreams and that can never be taken from you.

Best,

I was in love with a girl who was a senior when I was a freshman, and one day my sister let slip that I had a ""crush"" on this girl (thanks Sis.)  She was really attractive, and one thing about my recently departed Dad, he was an insufferable flirt.  So one day, when he was cussing us out for making him wait for the end of a rehearsal so we could go home, I said to him, ""Y'know, Dad, there are a *lot* of pretty girls in this play practice.""
It was ""play practice"" to Dad; ""rehearsal"" to everyone else.  I thought it made it sound more like basketball. 
""There are, are they?"" he said, giving me the squint-eye.
""Ayup.  And I think one of 'em likes me.""

That was enough; I think he was so relieved I liked girls he would tolerate the rest.  He still complained it was a road to nowhere, until 2) I brought home my first check, earned as a summer rep actor in an outdoor musical drama.    That's when he quit complaining.  

Just thought there'd be a few of you who had similar shared experiences.  My Dad died recently and I realized that despite all of his complaining and cussing, he *did* show up every time to take us home from rehearsal, and by the time I was a senior he even built a set for a play I was in.

My area of theatre is circus/physical theatre/dance cross over's, with circus as my main expertise so this may not apply for pure acting etc... but I would guess that there is a lot of cross over's.
Here is my words or wisdom for you

* **Very Important** READ THE CASTING BRIEF.  Seriously.  I am looking for skill X. Therefore I don't want people applying with skill Y, Z or, as I had today, *available with no skills but willing to learn if selected* No. I'm not even going to look at your CV.  Along the same lines, don't ask questions when the answer is in the brief. I don't have time and it makes me think you're an idiot. 

* Sell yourself! I hate reading emails apologising or making excuses. You are the commodity you are trying to sell! Imagine you are selling something, you don't want someone saying, ""it's alright, this function isn't that great but I suppose it works"".  Along the same lines, don't admit it's your first time applying for something (again like I got today).  You don't need to lie, but telling me you don't know what you're doing is not a great start. 

* CV's - 2 pages MAXIMUM.  I don't bother reading past 2 pages, put your skills in brief at the top, just an outline so I know what you can actually do.  Put a Highlight of your best jobs starting from the most recent first. I really don't care about the local community gig you did for you brother's friend in 1988, and it really shouldn't be at the top of your CV, I will stop reading.  (sounds' harsh but when you have 200 applicants or more, you just don't have time). 

* Show reels - please don't use a badly lit shaky poor quality hand cam footage. I stop watching.  Put some effort and if need be money into producing a nice show reel. I am more likely to be interested in good show reels than people who you can barely make out. 

* Websites.  It doesn't have to be great, just readable, easy lay-out.  Please don't use websites that look like geocitites. 

There's my advice to you. Take of it what you will, but I hope it may help some of you! ",,False,self,t5_2quc9,False,,,True,t3_qt5pn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/qt5pn/what_not_to_do_when_applying_for_a_casting_call/,

I've run this show done before (the company has toured it around some community halls etc., with me on tech, but this was a while ago) and until doors, it was average although the lighting was more complex. After doors though, the first scene felt almost brand new and the actors really hit it out of the park.

Give the actors a script and they'll give you the lines. give them an audience and they give you a performance.

I know it must be hard to believe, and honestly, I still can't quite rationalize it in my own head, but I think the show is very, ***very*** strong. I think that because of the title/content that the show is going to have a difficult time winning the hearts and minds of the public. I actually think that the show isn't even really about cheerleading at all. It's more about being happy with who you are. I quite frankly was expecting the show to be a hot mess, and I know that my low expectations are coloring my opinion, but I also believe that the show is good outright. The music is catchy and memorable, and I guess no surprise there, after all it's the teams from Next to Normal and In the Heights. The design is very slick and compelling; the lighting rig is gigantic, the costume plot is gigantic (and not insulting to teenagers, they actually look really cool), and the video design is so so awesome.

But most of all, the dance and gymnastics are really next level. I know that the stunts are not actually the highest level cheer stunts in the world, but for broadway, and to do it 8 times a week, it's actually an amazing feat. But besides that, Andy Blankenbuehler is a genius. His choreography actually tells a story. It's unlike standard broadway fare. I really can't stop thinking about it.

I know this gets said about a lot of shows, but you really have to give this one a chance, it sounds like it should be terrible, but it's really amazing.

That theatre celebrates a human race, brings people together, it holds the mirror up to nature. Apparently, this answer is what people want to hear. 

I think its bullshit.

Why do people feel the need to judge me when I say I am an actor for myself? I know its importance, but honestly, if you want to change the world with it, go into filmmaking. I do it because it makes me happy. I do it because it makes me feel. I am not good at expressing myself in real life. I don't have friends or family. I don't have strong opinions on politics or topical issues. But when I am a character, I do. When I am someone else I have a voice. 

I can finally cry for my mother when she had cancer. I can finally feel remorse for not connecting with my family. I can finally find a purpose to genuinely smile not because I am nervous or being polite. I do it because it is the only thing that makes me feel alive.

Real life is always playing the game. The stage is the only thing that is real.",,False,self,t5_2quc9,1357878688.0,,,True,t3_16czgo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/16czgo/is_it_selfish_to_say_i_do_theatre_for_myself/,

""[the actor] playing Cassius might have had that lean and hungry look 40 or 50 pounds ago"". 

i found this offensive. The actor is wonderful as cassius...and for the critic to use his SIZE as the sole reason to say he was miscast really pissed me off. 

IS the actor miscast? NO...not in my opinion. He is a terrific cassius...a non traditional cassius, but he nails the role. If the critic felt he wasn't right for the role, he certainly could have found a better way to say it without calling out physical attributes!

1338176534.0,15,self.Theatre,u874s,"Regarding the Various Theatre Subreddits (""Splinter Groups"")",MacBeth_in_Yellow,16,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/u874s/regarding_the_various_theatre_subreddits_splinter/,"Greetings, /r/theatre. I would like to call your attention to the ""related subreddits"" in the sidebar on the right hand side of your screen. Take a look through some of them. Pick a few at random.

You'll notice that some of them are fairly active. For example, /r/acting has 1,140 readers, three years as a community, and has new posts as recent as six hours ago--although it still doesn't seem to garner a great deal of commentary under each post. This subreddit--/r/theatre--is much the same way. Other subreddits have moderate participation, such as /r/techtheatre.

The subreddit that I've been moderating, /r/playclub, has been kept alive only by the efforts of two or three people. Even with dedicated moderators, maintaining participation is a challenge that we haven't found an effective solution for.

Many of the theatre subreddits are dead. Notice /r/thetechies (no posts), /r/theaterjobs (no posts), and /r/auditions (no posts). One of the more recent subreddits, /r/monologue, had five posts given within the first days of its creation, and stopped completely. There is also, notably, /r/monologues (a small but subtle distinction), created seven months prior, that suffered a similar fate.

Now, I don't point this out to discourage creative efforts on reddit; I think it's great that there are so many theatre people roaming around the site who are willing to, if not participate, at least read the ideas and thoughts of others. But there are some problems here:

First, theatre doesn't have the popularity it once did. A fairly small percentage of any given population (at least, within the first world) are regular theatre patrons, and significantly fewer actually participate in it. Theatre needs talent and dedication to survive. With so few in any given area out there to make it happen, deciding to saturate an area with more separate theatre groups than can be actively supported by both available talent and interested patrons, one or more of these groups are doomed to eventual failure.

Reddit is going to work the same way. It doesn't help that individual redditors are only allowed so many subscriptions on a single account. If any single redditor is to be expected to subscribe to more than a few theatre-related subreddits, they need to find something there that's worth the slot on their allowed subscription limit. We are, for example, trying to do something substantial with /r/playclub, but so far our success has been limited.

What this really boils down to is this: before starting a new subreddit, take a look through the available subreddits (idledebonair has done a wonderful job compiling all of the theatre subreddits in the sidebar) and make sure, first, that there isn't already an existing subreddit with the same goal you have in mind.

Second, and I know this suggestion goes against standard Reddit culture, but make sure that the goal of the new idea for a subreddit cannot already be covered within one of the existing, more active, subreddits. Maybe some of the ideas for collected monologues could, for example, be posted in /r/theatre. Perhaps someone might start a blog collecting possible monologues and post a monthly link to /r/theatre. Maybe someone might volunteer to create a FAQ containing more of the long-term useful information for one of these subreddits.

Further, perhaps some of us might consider taking a closer look at the existing ghost town subreddits and either attempting to revitalize them (this would, of course, take a lot of work) or looking into deleting them completely. I have no idea how to delete a subreddit (assuming it can be done at all), but some cleanup might help unify the existing redditors with a theatre interest.

Finally, these are all just thoughts. I think that, as a fairly small community, we should be open to suggestion and discussion regarding this issue. But I've noticed that there is some local frustration with the monthly thread on ""hey, let's start a new theatre subreddit!"", so I know it's not just me.

**tl;dr: There are too many dead theatre subreddits. Let's talk about consolidation and cleanup, and see if we can avoid creating new subreddits that will inevitably become ghost towns.**

Do you really think that we should be attempting to force audiences to modify their actions when they come to the shows, or should we as a community cast off some of the old conventions, and embrace the way people act in an attempt to create a new type of dialogue?

2) Does the typical college education (especially undergraduate level) really provide much benefit to the young actor, or do these programs need to be rebuilt with less focus on acting, and more focus on marketing/production?

3) Are NFP theatres that rely on donations to run their seasons really a good thing?  From my perspective, theatres that need constant cash infusions from the government and outside corporation are one reason that there is more theatre being produced than audiences want.  If you cannot run a business that is sustainable through ticket sales, space rentals, or whatever else, should you really be taking government money?

4) Finally, how can theatre become something that people strive to attend?  In contention against TV, Movies, Video Games, and sports, how do you get more people to a theatre?  

These are a few of the things that I have been kicking around with some friends, and I would love to hear some other input about these things.

EDIT: PS.  For all you like minded people that want to see major change in the conventions of theatre, message me.  I am playing with ideas to get the humble beginnings of a non-geolocked group together, and I would love to setup a crazy skype session or something to get to chatting about it.

- When asked for your schedule of availability, provide it the first time.

- If the director gives you a direction, he means for you to use it every  time you do that scene, unless stated otherwise.

- Don't take audition classes.  At best, they teach you to land a role you're not fit for.

- If something goes wrong during a show, don't just giggle, fix it.  

- Relating to the previous entry: if something is on stage that shouldn't be, get it off.  It will look bad for a second rather than for the whole scene.

- If you're better than everyone else, prove it, don't just act like it.

1329076147.0,16,self.Theatre,pmd0i,Technical Internship Interview Ideas/Tips,Psyko_Koolaid,18,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/pmd0i/technical_internship_interview_ideastips/,"I want to begin by saying that I am in no way the ultimate authority on this, and it is very likely that I’m not the first person to come up with these ideas. These are just my observations after sitting in a conference room all day doing 10 minute interviews with students/recent grads that were primarily looking for internships. I’m the ATD of a medium sized, professional summer theatre company.  I’ll be spending all of next Saturday interviewing people at another large audition/interview conference, and I wanted to post my current thoughts.

First things first, breathe. I understand you really want a job, and that there is a lot of stress that goes along with interviewing. The first thing I’m going to do when you come for an interview with me is shake your hand. Give me a nice firm handshake in return and calmly introduce yourself. I’m not going to bite, and I’m not going to brutally interrogate you.  I say this because I had many interactions this weekend where people were so nervous that their hands were shaking throughout the interview. I may not exactly look soft and cuddly, but I’m also not Santa Fe Opera. (Not that they are terrifying in any way either, just using a well known name to make a point.) The worst thing that could happen to you in the next 10 minutes is that you don’t impress me. While that isn’t desirable, it’s not a reason to torture yourself.


My next bit of advice may seem obvious but be aware of the time constraints. If this is an event where interviews are tightly scheduled do your best to stick to it. Be on time, and be aware of how long you’re spending on explanations/questions. If you bring your portfolio don’t expect to be able to cover it all in a 10 minute time slot. Ideally I’m going to want to look at and discuss your resume, and chat in general about your experience level and/or goals. In my mind I want to try and gauge how well you would fit a position in both personality and skill. I do want to see the portfolio, but I don’t want that to be the bulk of a first interview. Pick out a few key pages and explain the relevant parts until about 1 minute before your slot ends. I will always ask questions if I have them.


Do your research, and come with questions. Knowing a little something about the company you are interviewing for goes a long way. If I don’t have to take 1-2 minutes to explain the kind of work we produce that leaves us more time to talk about your skills and examine your work. Take 5 minutes of your own time to check out our season and look at some photos, and if you want more specific information ask me. One or two intelligent questions will make you stick out.
I saw a lot of freshman and sophomore students who had a resume full of any credit they could list. I understand the necessity of doing this in your first few years. I had to do it too. Several times when I asked these students what they specialized in or what they were looking for they would answer, “Everything,” or “Anything.” No. You can’t specialize in everything. I want you to have a well rounded knowledge of technical work, but I want you to have a passion for a more specific area within it. Pick an area that suits your strengths, or that you want to hone your skill in. *In my opinion* there is nothing wrong with saying something like, “I got my start as a carpenter, but I’ve developed an interest in electrics so I’ve also been taking as many electrician positions as I can in the past year.”


My last bit of advice is to be excited and engaged. I’m likely doing interviews all day. You’re likely to be doing the same thing. If you come to me with zero confidence or are so anxious that you can’t hold a conversation it doesn't give me much to go with in terms of approximating your abilities or personality. If you’re really tired, or really nervous, fake it. Sit up straight, look me in the eyes and smile. If I can’t get you engaged in the interview I’m likely to lump you in with the mob of people who I know I interviewed, but can’t remember a thing about. Don’t barrage me with fake pep, but be warm and honest. If my BS meter goes off that is the first thing I’m going to remember. I like to challenge people. If I’m asking a lot of questions it’s because I’m trying to get you to break out of the standard, ‘safe’ responses. I want you to sell yourself as a whole person, not just as your resume.
Again, I’m not the final word on any of this. There are other people who have other priorities. These are the things that matter to me when I talk with people looking for internships. Everyone interviews differently, and some of this becomes less crucial in longer interviews or on a 2nd or 3rd interview. Still, I feel that the some of the general ideas are useful in any interview.


**tl;dr**

* 1. Be calm. It’s an interview not an interrogation.
* 2. If you only have 10 minutes, use them well.
* 3. Know who you’re talking to.
* 4. Be well rounded, but have specific skills/goals.
* 5. Be confident and honest. I want to hire a person, not a resume.

I'm an undergraduate with a focus in directing with a decent amount of directing and assistant directing credits under my belt. I'll be graduating in December - this fall is my final semester of undergrad and I've been given a gallery-level production to direct which is normally reserved for MFA directors.

I love directing theatre and I know it's what I want to do for a living. However, I also know from speaking to current successful directors that the path to professional theatre directing is one of complete randomness, luck, chance, and connections. As of now, I know that unless some completely random and incredible opportunity presents itself, I'll be moving back in with the folks come December while applying to every possible theatre employment, internship, and apprenticeship opportunity available in the Chicago area in the upcoming months, as well as sending my directing resume out to any smaller theatres that may actually give an undergraduate director a chance. 

Right now some of my top and most hopeful choices include an apprenticeship or internship at Steppenwolf, internships at the Goodman, Victory Gardens, or Chicago Shakespeare Theatre, and trying to work with the Neo-Futurists. I know that I'll have a decently strong resume as well as letters of recommendation but in the long run that still probably won't mean much.

From all of you who have gone through the same struggle of finding work in the theatre, whether specifically in Chicago or elsewhere in the country, what advice do you have? I have student loans to take care of myself, so even getting advice on what type of feasible theatre-related day jobs to look for to pay the bills while finding a show to be involved with at night would be helpful.

Basically, any tips on where to even get started as someone who wants to work in professional theatre would be greatly appreciated. Even tips on how to find shows to direct from any fellow directors would be great! I know we all struggle to both make art and still survive in this world, and I know I wouldn't be happy doing anything else. Any words of wisdom are appreciated, thank you!",,False,self,t5_2quc9,False,,,True,t3_tsazb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/tsazb/theatre_in_chicagowhat_do_i_do/,

The concept is to condense the WHOLE theatrical experience into...you guessed it...24 hours. From the moment the actors audition to the performance the next night, the teams have 24 hour to cast, write, direct, and put a show together.

Our process is this: There are generally 5 teams of writers and directors before the experiment takes place. The actors audition, and afterwards the writers and directors preform a draft to put together a team (mind you, the shows have yet to be written). Once the actors are chosen, the actors and directors go home, as the writers stay all night to write a 10-15 show. When the actors and directors come back in the morning, they are given a show they have never seen and spend the day blocking, rehearsing, and  setting up any tech for that nights performance.

I have both acted and written, and would suggest this experience for anyone! If you love the process and manic of theatre, this is for you.

The director (also the main writer of the show) sent us our tech schedule last night, and I found myself, at 1 in the morning, verbally (and loudly) questioning his sanity to myself.

The show itself is very combat-heavy, as it's about a bloodsport in the near future. Monday consists of 6 hours of fight work with 30 mins. of break, 1 hour dinner break, then running the show 3 times (estimated another 6 hours). Tuesday calls for all actors to be there from 10am to 11pm, with sporadic breaks throughout the day. Wednesday is tech set-up and 3 more show runs, 10am-10pm. Thursday is Opening night, with a 4pm call for an 8pm show. Performances run through Saturday.

Oh, and did I mention that we're doing the second weekend run of the show in a different theater? As such, the director wants to repeat the whole tech schedule for the second weekend at the second theater.

I can't be the only one who thinks this is a bit excessive. He's asking us to take time off of work to rehearse, which I can't do in order to remain financially stable. I can see how, as the author of this story, he would want this show to be the best it could possibly be, but this level of rehearsal can very quickly burn out the cast, which could in turn cause safety problems with the level of fighting in this show. And since we're not an equity company, there's no one I can go to (other than possibly the stage manager, which probably wouldn't do much in this instance) and talk about this issue. Is there something else I can do, or do I have to go straight to the source?

**Tl;dr**: Director went crazy and scheduled a shitload of tech rehearsal. This could become a financial and safety issue. How can I get him to figure out this is a bad idea?

So if anyone had any questions.,Charlemun,14,4,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/q62wr/i_auditioned_for_juilliard_about_a_month_ago_so/,"Some of you may have saw my post about it earlier (thanks for the support).

But I thought there might be the odd person that was thinking about auditioning, and might have some questions.

 I auditioned at the school in New York.
There are 4 stages to the overall audition process, three of which happen on the day.

1. General auditions where you perform 2 contrasting monologues and maybe a song (if they ask).

2. Out of the general auditions they call back anywhere from  3-15 people. But that is a bit of an estimate from talking with them. At the call back you perform in front of the teachers. You play improv games and ask you a couple questions.

3. They a few people from the callback group to stay for personal interviews. Just because you didn't get a callback doesn't mean you're no longer being considered. 

and finally. 

4. Out of all the callbacks on each audition day, the invite 40 people to comeback to the school in march for a weekend. Then out of that they select an estimated 18 people. 

Just a bit of info for anyone interested. Let me know if you have any questions, more than willing to help!

Dear members and friends: today we begin the next phase of the Valley Free Radio (VFR) Theater Project. Last summer we planted the seeds of this endeavor at a fundraising meeting, and all in attendance were excited about bringing radio theater to the airwaves again (a staple of the early days of broadcast radio in this country). When we floated the concept in other VFR circles, it was loudly supported. When we floated the idea to other people and groups, we were met with hearty cheers and encouragement. We found immediate support from the local theatre group Serious Play! who in turn pitched the idea to us of a first performance of “Love, Anarchy, and Other Affairs,” by Jessica Litwak. This is a play about the life and loves of Emma Goldman, and which has been performed in New York and other locals, and the playwright and lead actress is living here in the Valley, and is a sponsor of the project. What could be better?

Emma Goldman, as many of you know, is a founder of the anarchist movement, plus an early feminist, labor activist and radical thinker in all ways. The play traces a short period in her life when she was on the run from the law, and fearing for her life. She was a Russian immigrant factory girl who became a labor activist/organizer and fiery orator on the speaker circuits in the early 1900's. She fought for free speech, women's right and free love long before those concepts were popular. We hope to bring her story to you and wider audiences through the medium of radio theater.

There are of course significant costs for making this happen, as we will need to pay royalties, rent a professional studio, pay actors, etc. but we believe the end product will be outstanding, and will build strong support and acclaim for the station.

But this cannot all happen with the support of only a few of us. It will truly take a large majority of us shoulder to shoulder pushing forward to reach this goal. There is much you can do. First and foremost, please make a donation of any size. The best way to do this is through our crowd funding source—IndieGoGo. There you can make a donation via a credit card, as well as seeing pieces of the production in our short video, plus further descriptions of the play, the actors, the playwright, and what we are trying to achieve.

I've never even really been to a school production, so I'm seriously clueless about the dos and do nots of theater.

First of all, what seats should I go for? Honestly I can afford them all (I'm a HS student with no bills to pay and a fast-food job that works me far too often) but I'm not sure it's worth it to pay, say, 78 bucks a seat for front orchestra/loge front. Is it going to be hard to see/hear if I get the cheap seats in the rear balcony?

Second, etiquette. Clearly this isn't going to be a jeans and t-shirt affair, but how formal do I need to be? Dress shirt, tie, and slacks good enough? How formal does she need to be? Any special rules in theaters different from say, a movie?

Finally, food. Can you eat and buy snack food in most theaters? Or am I going to have to take her out to a nice dinner as well?

She quit because she felt like she couldn't please me so I found someone else) and I just had an actor drop out due to scheduling, not to mention working a full time job while doing this, and being in school full time.

Most months I can pay my bills and put some into savings, but after a recent health crisis throwing a wrench into my season, I'm now having to reevaluate this whole lifestyle.


For the past year and a half, I've been running myself ragged with small gigs, trying to build my portfolio as much as possible, but that urgency landed me in the ICU and with lasting health issues. Now as I'm trying to make sense of everything and get back to work, I wonder if there are better ways to make thoughtful work in Theatre. Is getting an MFA and trying for a teaching gig a safe bet, or would the debt be too risky? What about day jobs? I tend to fill my daylight hours with scenic painting or props fabrication, but the pay varies considerably and the work is not reliable. My partner does not make enough money to support us both. Currently, I have 5 projects to finish by mid-January and that is too many to have a full-time job on top of. When I got out of school, I was desperate to take all the gigs I could so I could build my portfolio and move to a bigger city but now I am seriously second-guessing myself. Ending up with an IV in my arm again and six weeks of bedrest is not an option again.


If you've been working in the industry, I would really appreciate insight on how a young theatre artist can make it work. My health is something I will not have for long if I keep working at this pace and that reality is beginning to frighten me.

The course is generally excellent bar one lecturer who teaches in an extremely airy fairy sort of way. She’s against thinking things out and so obsessed with living the moment that she lectures by making it up as she goes along, believing it to be more true. She frequently contradicts herself and forgets how she starts sentences but finishes them anyway. Here are a few quotes I took from a two hour lecture this morning.

In response to a girl being unable to track down a script: “Everything is possible if you’re an actor”

“The best actors do more work than I’ve given them.” She frequently forgets what work and how much of it she has given.

Speaking of a metaphor she came up with five minutes previously: “I’m sure there’s a scientific reason acting spreads from the top down” 

“It is you buts it is a deeper you, it is not you. Is that clear?”

A student jokes about how horrible it would be to put years of work into a charter only to die just before playing the part. She replies, deadly serious: “Well then you’re not an actor”

Again talking of her metaphor, which she has now badly drawn: “the scribbles are the Actor’s spirit, I’m simplifying this but it’s a… eh…” Quickly changes subject.

“We do it because we don’t have the money” Minutes later: “I don’t know why we do it.”

“Even if you’re not a Jewish”

“You have to be yourself… becoming the actor… acting as yourself”

“You’re three quarters of the way there, I just need that extra fifteen percent.”

5 people have just done an exercise. “Now the other half of ye up and do it” Our class has 24 students.

We started up last summer as a group of east Texas college students/alum that wanted to get the ball rolling on some independent theatre.

We hooked up with Michael K. Ward of Tyler, Texas who wrote a beautiful play called ""The Bloodline."" It had won multiple writing awards in Austin, Dallas, and Seattle but had never been performed. Until we came along. We brought it to life for the first time at Dallas' own Nouveu 47 at the Magnolia Lounge, and then took it to Tyler, Texas where we performed at Tyler Civic Theater.

Our time was limited, and resources few, but we garnered a small following with it. Because of our troupe's diversity, we found ourselves pretty split up this summer, and missed out on getting anything going.

I, however, am looking to expand The Vanguard Players into a larger group open to any and all who want to be involved. 

Our ""partnership"" with Nouveau 47 has been put on hold because of limitations put forth by the Magnolia Lounge's owners. This leaves us without a space to rehearse, perform, etc. Another reason why getting things rolling lately have been difficult. 

My partners and I have a ton of plans and a few resources to make our next project happen. But this is where I look to everyone in the area.

I need more people. I need directors, writers, actors, hell I need owners and people who know of spaces to use.

We have hired ourselves out to local theatre folk who need ensembles, running crews, etc. but that's not what I'm after. I want sonething more real. I want to turn The Vanguard Players into a much bigger thing than it is now.

Feel free to look at our facebook page, www.facebook.com/thevanguardplayers

It's not anything special and isn't run by me so it doesn't feature quality production photos or anything, nor has it been updated in a loooong time, but it's there if you wanna check iy out, and will be getting a big revamp should something come out of this.

Basically, any and all DFW theatre folk are encouraged to reach out to us. In fact, any and all theatre people PERIOD are encouraged to reach out. We are dedicated to new works and are always taking submissions to be staged. 

We have begun work on an undisclosed project in junction with the UT Arlington theatre department, but are in dire need of a space. That, first and foremost, is what we seek.

I was hired to SM a play with a one month rehearsal process and a one month run for $700 (the show closed February 23). I ended up paying about $200 out-of-pocket for supplies, and gave the receipts to the director (stupidly) without making photocopies. Long story short, I had a medical emergency that put me in the hospital for one day during tech week, and they hired someone to replace me, although they still wanted me back. I finished the run as essentially an ASM. The show lost money, and the director now wants to pay me $400 and not reimburse me for supplies - so essentially pay me $200. In addition, my parents donated $250 to the production's Kickstarter, so I really ended up paying $50 to be a part of this failure of a show (I'm a student, and I'm dependent on them for most of my income). Moreover, the director keeps promising to pay me in ""a month or so"", but the check never arrives. I've talked to the designers, and they've told me that they aren't getting paid at all. I expressed my concern about this to the director, who told me that ""I'm lucky to be getting the $400 after what [I] did to the show"", and that I'll get my paycheck when he's able to pay me, which I suspect could be as late as a year from now.

I'm starting to put together a court case, and I'm wondering what the going rate for stage managers are. I've heard of SMs being paid anywhere from $600 for a run to $100/night on the community theater / off-off-Broadway level. Does anyone have this information? Is there a publication of this stuff that could be presented as evidence? I was thinking of hiring someone as an ""expert witness"" to testify about the pay rate for stage managers - do you think that's a good idea?

Thank you!

I started going to school for Computer Administration, it was just kinda like my easy way out. But I just cant see myself doing that for a career. The sad part is that I'm almost done with this computer thing. 

What advice can you guys give or goals that I can set that will lead to a career technical theatre. Im willing to just start over, go to a school that has a technical theatre major or whatever. I just cant see myself doing anything else. The adrenaline of opening night just knowing people are depending to perform your duties on cue. Or do I even have to go to school, can I intern at a local playhouse with no experience other than High school?

Also I live in Orlando,Fl if that makes any difference.
I noticed the local community college has a major in that field. But It has 2 specializations: Live Show and Production Design. [Valencia Entertainment and Design Technology Major](http://valenciacollege.edu/asdegrees/arts/documents/EntertainmentDesignAndTech.pdf)

I go to play poker at a local gay bar, and i think every player there has some connection to theatre.

We need monologues. Reddit is an extremely interesting place because it provides us with information about things that we want more information about! So, why not monologues?

Apparently, 9 months ago, someone had a brilliant idea and created a subreddit for monologues. The posting structure is great, because the title of each post includes Gender, Genre, Age, and Era. If in need of a monologue, you can easily scroll through and find one that is relevant to your needs without any serious hassle. 

Then, as a service to others, maybe you post a monologue or two that you've found helpful for others to find. 

Nowhere is there another service like this. Free, diverse, well organized, (hopefully) creative monologues for the sharing.

Need advice.,Jccho,9,0,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/13quhb/changing_audition_monologue_this_late_need_advice/,"Hey, r/theatre. I need some advice please. First, a little background. I'm a freshman in college majoring in theatre and hoping to become a high school or college theatre teacher one day. I'm just wrapping up my first semester, which will end with me playing Peter Cratchit in A Christmas Carol in a little less than 2 weeks. So I've gotten experience in my college's department already.

Now here's the thing: It's (late) Saturday right now. I have an audition for all three of next semester's shows on Tuesday. One of these three is a musical, so we were allowed to do one of two things: 1.0 2 contrasting 1 minute monologues (I don't think they actually time it though) or 2.) A 1 minute monologue and a song. Now, laugh if you have to but...I've actually never been in a musical before (the high school drama program I came from was terrible and we couldn't even think about doing musicals, just leaving it at that.) and I didn't feel like this was the time to start. (I'm defiantly looking ahead at audition material for next year's musicals though.)

So, I'm doing the first option. And it was recommended, but not mandatory, that those of us doing the first option do 1 contemporary monologue and 1 classical. This is because of our 2 non-musicals, one is Servant of Two Masters. So that's what I did, and I have a serious monologue from And Then There Were None and a humours one from Two Gentlemen of Verona. The former I have down pat, but the latter one is really stressing me out. I'm really not the best Shakespeare person, and I feel like this monologue, despite the contemporary/classical request, is going to hurt me more than help me. I've tried as much as I can but it's just not working.

So, I've considered doing another humorous monologue from Rumors by Neil Simon (which I've done before, so I still have it memorized and everything.) But I'm not sure if they'll like me not taking their advice about the classical monologue. But on the other hand, Tuesday's almost here and I might not be 100% if I perform the classical one. What should I do? I'm sorry for any confusion or anything in this post but this is REALLY stressing me out, especially with Christmas Carol right around the corner. 

Big thanks in advance!",,False,self,t5_2quc9,False,,,True,t3_13quhb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/13quhb/changing_audition_monologue_this_late_need_advice/,

1329690435.0,7,self.Theatre,pwxfe,I just watched The Lady From Dubuque (Signature Theatre Company),SansPulp,8,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/pwxfe/i_just_watched_the_lady_from_dubuque_signature/,"I don't even know what to say.

I went to the theatre on a whim. I'm studying film here in New York to round out my theatre degree I got back in Canada, because, well, I've been feeling a little useless in the Canadian theatrical scene lately. I'm in that stage of my life where I'm watching my friends get roles while I get none, and am forced to self produce and write and direct to get any kind of work and exposure to the community. And in NYC, it feels like the same thing. I'm not getting cast in these student films though I eat, sleep, and breathe this art form, while my friends go out drinking every night, don't show up to classes, never remember their lines, and get leading roles in Ang Lee films. What?! And you've probably thought it by this point, and I think it every day, but I'm not a bad actor. I'm really not. And I'm not hideous either, nor am I difficult to work with. I'm a decent looking guy, reasonably confident, and always reliable. I'll admit I can occasionally be accused of hamming, indicating, and emoting, and rightly so, but with the correct direction that can be ironed out. I don't hit all the notes on the first day, but I audition very well, and can be counted on to deliver a good performance by the time the show goes up. But anyway.

While I've been here, in NYC, I've been feeling kind of lonely. I'm a social guy in my hometown, but I get this sense of alienation everywhere I go. I read earlier today on Reddit that the French have this  saying about wanting to jump when you stand on a ledge. The Call of the Void. And I've been feeling that a lot lately, every time I stand on a bridge or a tall building or a subway platform. And I'm just living in my head, trying to find, I don't know, some reason? And I've been going to a lot of plays and comedy shows and movies here alone, because the friends I've made only seem to want to go to clubs, and particularly loud clubs at that. And I don't think there is anything wrong with clubs, and I don't suffer a paralyzing fear of dancing, but I just don't **thrive** there I guess, or even **enjoy** it particularly, so I tend to avoid it, catch up on my sleep, learn my lines, or something of the sort.

Today I woke up feeling well rested and decided to check out a matinee of Blood Knot by Athol Fugard at the Signature Theatre Company. Putting a serious wrench in that, however, is the fact that a couple weeks ago I was the victim of credit card fraud, and now I have no credit card, so I have to show up at the theatre and hope they have tickets, or make **firstworldproblems**. Lo and behold, Blood Knot was sold out, but there were some tickets left for The Lady From Dubuque. I didn't know anything about the play, but I knew Albee was a 3 time Pulitzer winner, and the tickets were only $25 dollars, and I was down here anyway, and wouldn't you know it I was standing upstairs with a ticket a few minutes later.

I read the billboard outside the theatre and thought Albee sounded a bit pretentious, insinuating that Noel Coward wasn't a great playwright (at least how I read one of his quotes), and a bunch of other stuff about how we write for **art** sake and to teach lessons and challenge people and a bunch of stuff that never really **works** for me. And after the first act, I texted a friend back home, and said that the play was witty and neat, and the direct address was alienating and challenging, and whatever else.

Then the second act came.

Whatever I say about what Mr. Albee made me feel in this second act would be reductive. The best metaphor I can make is that he put his fist inside my chest and opened up his fingers. I...I don't know, woke up? Or came online? It was the first time in the **many** plays I've seen that leapt to my feet to applaud. However, the leap was preceded by these feelings of emptiness and alertness and wonder and a thousand other words that don't do it justice. Afterwards, I paced around the theatre out of breath, wondering if I was going to cry or laugh or scream. I flipped through a dozen books in the bookstore, considered getting a drink, and finally walked to the bathroom. When I did, I passed one of the actresses. My face contorted into a dozen shapes, and I said ""great show"", but all that left my mouth was air, devoid of any sound. She cocked her eyebrow at me and passed me by, and I'll never see her again.

After I gathered myself up in the washroom, I reentered the lobby. There he was. Edward Albee, talking to the director, and the actress I just passed. I lurked in the shadows, peering and glaring at him, both out of admiration and contempt, contempt that he just divided my life into the moment before I saw his show and the moment after I saw his show. I browsed his history on the display screen not 5 feet behind him, which in retrospect, is one of the weirdest things I've ever done. I then went and talked to one of the girls at the concierge desk, gushing and gushing, saying ""Is that him? Is that Edward? Is that the man who destroyed me?"", and it was, it was! I couldn't approach him, I knew that as soon as I saw him. What would I say? I couldn't say anything to the actress, let alone the creator. But I lingered in the room long enough for me to realize what had just happened, and in the hopes of something ethereal happening, like a meeting of souls on the astral plane, or something, I'm not sure what, but some lesson I might learn from simply being in the same room as him for ten minutes so that one line from one play I write can some day affect someone as much as this whole play affected me.

I'm sorry for the length of this rant, but I needed to get that off my chest. I realize only someone who is insane would read this whole passage, especially for its masturbatory use of the word I, but a feeling inside me compelled me to write, so I did. Has anyone else ever had this feeling after walking out of a show when they never thought they could? Tell me I'm not alone.

",texasmusicalsucks,12,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/j4o3a/dear_reddit_if_you_get_the_chance_to_work_for/,"Just a warning, this may be really long but I have made it my mission in life to make sure that no one works for this place, ever. Especially if you're a part of the Technical Theater side. Texas! The Musical Drama is a corrupted place run by a super-rich pedophile who doesn't give a shit about professionalism; only about getting what he wants.


A little Background: Texas is a show that takes place in the Palo Duro Canyon, it has been running for 46 years and is an outdoor drama.

I have worked for Texas twice, once in '08 and this summer. I was not hired at the beginning of the season, but when one of my friends, a stagemanager, asked me to cover for one of her nights, a contract was thrown at me and they were basically like ""Welcome to the season."" They did this because they didn't hire enough people at the beginning of the season. I believe they are at least 3-4 technicians down from last year. (That already shows you how organized they are).

Usually following each show, there is a big fireworks display. However, because of an intense drought there is a very strict no-burn policy. So what do they do instead? A water show. That's right, wasting thousands of gallons of water during a drought, smart.

Before I continue, I believe there are somethings you need to know about Joe. Joe Batson is one of our biggest contributors to the theater, he gives us lots and lots of money to do exciting things (like that water show). However, because of this he thinks he has a right to step into the show and do whatever he wants with it. Oh, and did I mention he plead guilty to endangering a child while being charged with sexually assaulting a child?

http://amarillo.com/stories/022102/new_batson.shtml

http://amarillo.com/stories/022202/new_forbatson.shtml

One of the conditions being he has no contact with anyone under the age of 17? Huh, that's strange, I see him down in the canyon all of the time talking to children. He also has several young men (most of them of age at least) who are basically his sex toys. (We call them the Batson Boys).

What happened last night was the straw that broke the camel's back so to speak. Joe, along with Vince, the Production Manager, fired our Technical Director, a man with SIXTEEN years of experience, fourteen in outdoor theater, six out at Lost Colony, (the most well-known and longest running out door drama in the United States) and gave his job to, you guessed it, a Batson Boy. But not even the one that has done theater before. Yep, they gave the job to someone who has NEVER worked in a theater before in his entire life.

And then they have the gall to have a “We’re all a family and have to stick together” meeting afterwards while all of us are standing there, wanting so much to tell them to fuck off.

1301771327.0,10,self.Theatre,gh87z,I'm already 80 hours and $18k invested into a degree but my real passion is theatre tech!  What do??,letusprey,10,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/gh87z/im_already_80_hours_and_18k_invested_into_a/,"Hey guys, I don't mean to flood the board with ""waaah, I'm a student and don't know what to do with myself!!""  But I saw the other thread about the person who couldn't decide between poli sci or tech and the quality of the responses prompted me to make a thread of my own.  So here it goes...

I'm attending a state school here in the American mid-west with a fairly good reputation for it's drama program.  All throughout high school and even into college I've been a theatre rat, clinging onto whatever shows I could, running tech, acting, stage managing, whatever.  I even hold down a job at a local PAC as their house stage hand and general technician.  My problem is that when I first came to college I wasn't so sure about my future so I opted for a degree oriented to the pure sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology) thinking such a degree would have the potential to get me a job just about anywhere.  Having tackled o-chem, lots of physics and genetics, I'm simply getting burned out and am coming to the realization that I have zero passion for what I'm doing and wake up every morning thinking about how I should've just followed my heart at the beginning and studied to be a techie - its what I spend all my time doing anyway.  

My unique problem is that I'm already a junior and, as the title of this thread implies, am 18k in debt to the feds for my student loans.  I was told by the TD at the drama school that I could fit the tech program into three years if I switched right now, but not any less.  So by the time I were to get out of school, I would be pushing 50k.  I desperately want to switch gears and go for what I love doing and be around theatre people the rest of my life, but I'm not sure I could make the payments on a technician's salary once I graduate.  The problem gets even worse when talking about grad school - a place I would like to attend someday as well.  So r/theatre, anyone have a similar experience they'd like to share to give me some inspiration on what to do with myself?  I'd really appreciate it :)


EDIT:
I guess I wasn't too clear before.  I currently work in a PAC when I'm not in school so I am getting that supplementary education.  However, I can't help but feel like I'm not learning enough to be competitive in the business.  A formal education would really do me some good, I think.  Also, with regard to my current major (zoology), I'm really not enjoying it that much and to be perfectly honest, I haven't really met a single person I've had a good enough connection with to really want to form any sort of friendship outside of the normal meeting in class.  All my friends are either from high school or people I've met at my job at the PAC.  I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on the whole college experience.  So, at 80 / 125 hours needed to graduate, I'm really wishing that I would've done tech to begin with.  But alas, I did not and am having some serious doubts.  I'll probably be in another 2 years at least finishing up zoo, so switching at this point would only put me  another year in the hole overall.  It just sucks that money is a factor in schooling.  If it wan't I would switch today, but, as I said before, my education is financed by loans so paying them back is something I'd have to consider, especially on a technician's salary.  I wish I lived in Germany and got a free education, damn. :P  Thanks for listening to my rants, I'm really trying to get all the advice I can on this topic because its a pretty major switch.",,False,self,t5_2quc9,True,,,True,t3_gh87z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/gh87z/im_already_80_hours_and_18k_invested_into_a/,

I'm a pretty fast memorizer and the best thing for me has always just been getting up there and doing it over and over again, but when you are double cast, you can't always be up there rehearsing. I've found that a pretty alright alternative is recording myself doing the lines and cues in a couple of different ways. 

If anyone is playing the character Martha in Arsenic and Old Lace, I'd be happy to give you my recordings. 

For the whole show, I go through and read a cue, a line, the same cue, and then silence so I can say the line when I am listening.
For example:
""'It's just there way of digging up people to do some good to.' .. 'Well now, isn't this nice?' .. 'It's just there way of digging up people to do some good to.' '...........' 'Good afternoon, Ms. Brewster!' .. 'How do you do, Mr. Brophy, Dr. Harper, Ms. Klein?' .. 'Good afternoon, Ms. Brewster!' '..............'""

I have recordings of the cues only for Acts 1 and 2. I never got around to it for Act 3.
Cues only recordings sound like this:
""'It's just their way of digging up people to do some good to.' '............' 'Good afternoon Ms. Brewster!' '..........' 'How are ya, Ms. Brewster? We dropped in to get the Christmas toys.' '.........'""

This should be especially helpful if you are an understudy and don't get much stage time.

Upvote for visibility, I suppose, and let me know if you would like the recordings! Totally free, you may or may not find them beneficial, I just figured I would have appreciated them in January, so maybe you will too.

I heard this great song a couple of times, but I don't know it well enough to Google anything about it. Both times I heard the beginning or middle of the song, but not the whole thing.

From the sound of it, it's obviously from a musical. It contains a mechanical typewriter as percussion, and is sung by a character who seems to be a doctor. He's writing a report or journal about his care of a young woman about some mysterious condition she's suffering from, and of which he's determined to cure her.

The only lyrics I can (barely) recall are something along the lines of ""She'll dance again"" or maybe it's ""sing again"" or ""talk again"" or something.

I Googled those lyrics, but all I could find were articles on people who'd suffered trauma.

I don't know musicals well enough to have any clue what this is from, so I thought I'd turn here. Anybody know?

It's called ""Once Upon A Time 6x In The West"" and just opened last night in downtown Seattle at the Jones Playhouse. 

The story itself is a simple one with a common twist, but the *way* it is told is the reason to see the show: the costumes, set designs, and acting styles all hold true to the styles from which each section (act) is derived. 

For the Peter Brook section, the set and costumes are minimal. For Wilson's section - elaborate and colorful. There are 6 acts to the show, each focusing on a different style. All told, it's the two just mentioned as well as Grotowski, Mabou Mines, Wooster Group, and Ridiculous Theatrical Company - with nods to Gob Squad, Emma Rice, and Conni's Avant Garde Restaurant.

Hilarity, sincerity, and mania come barreling at you all throughout the show. It has surprises around every corner and you'll never once leave the edge of your seat - I'd even go as far to say it's the most entertaining theatre show I've *ever* seen.

I am a big fan of theatre, so figured that it would make sense for me to write this paper about a theatrical piece. It obviously can't be a musical, so that leaves me with plays. I love shows that some may consider depressing (Next to Normal, Spring Awakening), but are beautiful at the same time. This doesn't mean that I wouldn't do a happy play, I just love those types of shows.

I'm not as familiar with plays as I am with musicals, so I am here for advice. Can anyone suggest a play that I should consider? We have read The Crucible and The Glass Menagerie in class, and we are about to read Fences. I would consider doing TGM, but I want to see what else is out there.

Thank you so much!!

These exchanges tend to be fairly brief, and the ones that are longer tend to have lots of words that sound like their English equivalent (i.e., even if you don't know exactly what is being said, the gist is very apparent).

The director has requested that during every Spanish exchange, we make use of the projector system in the theater to project a translation of what is being said above the stage.

I can't even begin to describe how terrible an idea I think this is... Leaving out the obvious technical challenges (the ridiculous precision we'll need on the part of the techie running whatever PowerPoint we'd have up for this purpose, and the risk of the computer doing something like blue-screen-of-deathing mid show), I think it'll just be tacky as hell, and completely break the 4th wall.

We've (techies and actors) already tried to casually approach the director on this matter, but their mind seems to be made up.  

Has anyone encountered this situation before?  Did you manage to get out of it, or did you end up with closed captioning?  Did it look terrible?

**tl;dr** Director wants us to make use of an unreliable projector system to project translation captioning during a play.  Any ideas on how to talk them out of what seems like an awful idea?

**Edit:** To everyone who has provided useful advice (particularly those who had recommendations regarding font choices, encouragement that it doesn't always look awful, and trying to do a dry run to show the director how it looks) thank you.

To those who have opted for a more antagonistic approach (particularly the condescending taunts of ""just do your job"" and ""stop being lazy""...) this is not my first rodeo.  I have been a tech director for *years* (and have experience in set design, lighting, and even a smattering of acting and stage combat), and have gone all out on some of the most batshit crazy ideas ever.  This is however, this director's *first* rodeo (he has never directed any show *ever*, and has *only* very limited acting experience).  He already had to be talked into even having a set after declaring that building one would simply be too hard (without consulting anyone on the technical staff...).  

I am *very* familiar with the resources in this theater, and *very* familiar with how excruciating unreliable many pieces of equipment are.  You call for respect of the hierarchy while condemning the foolish mortal techie who would dare step out of line...  In this case we need a little hand holding (which is why I was hoping for diplomatic advisement...), but instead you respond with arrogant ""just do your job"" declarations.  This is **exactly** the reason an antagonistic relationship tends to form between production staff, technical staff, and actors...",,False,self,t5_2quc9,1359491501.0,,,True,t3_17g8as,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/17g8as/advice_for_a_techie_on_most_diplomatic_approach/,

Is that accurate? 

The theatre I'm assisting definitely has some educational aspects within the company and in terms of building a new audience, but I'm not sure how much of a spotlight to give those aspects or if I should focus more on the theatre's artistic mission. Thoughts?

My own discovery of these subreddits was really the selling point for creating an account at Reddit instead of just lurking, and I love the potential that many of these subreddits have.

I do wonder if some of these subreddits may have been created in haste, simply because some of the specific goals of these could probably have been accomplished within existing subreddits (I noticed, for example, that there are *two* subreddits for monologues at this point). I mean, there's nothing inherently wrong with creating a subreddit, whether or not it is redundant. But as a theatre community (both online and IRL), we're already a fairly small number of people, and I think it is important that we work together whenever possible to avoid spreading ourselves too thin.

Those are just some basic thoughts, and I certainly don't mean harsh criticism. When it comes down to it, I'm yet another person who was infected with the love for the active arts, and I've been missing the opportunity to communicate with others who feel the same IRL.

I would love to work with some local productions -- community playhouses, that kind of thing. I'm not looking for a career, I'm not looking to go big. 

The problem is, I haven't done anything involved with theatre in a long time. I'm a senior at university, and I haven't been involved with theatre beyond viewing in a while. I played cello in the pit in high school, took classes in acting/singing/dancing in middle school, and was in a few plays when I was very young (ie. 11 and below). I have worked a Renaissance Festival for a few years, but I know that's a very different format so I'm not sure if it's valid for more ""standard"" theatre. So I don't have any idea what I would put on a resume and I don't know where to start.

So, fellow theatre fans, how do I get started? Am I too late to really get involved? Any tips to breaking into the local theatre scene?

Considering the fact that I was one of the few people there who could both act *and* carry a tune, I'm fairly confident that I'll get a part, even if it's not a lead. The director said that casting would be finished within 24 hours, and that the confirmation emails would be sent within two days, and although that is a fairly short wait by normal standards, the suspense is agonizing. The longer that I sit and stew while continuously refreshing my email, the more I begin to doubt my performance.

Were they laughing at my comedic timing, or did they just think I was pathetic?

Did they care that I stumbled over the tempo when I sang ""On The Steps of The Palace?""

Were the ""[Not Bad](http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lltzgnHi5F1qzib3wo1_400.jpg)"" faces that they made really frowns of disapproval?

My own personal insecurities aside, I'm curious as to how my fellow actors deal with the wait. Surely most actors are better at handling stress than I am. Considering the fact that most people don't have crippling social anxiety that only disappears when performing. (And I know that the usual advice is to get busy doing other things, but I honestly have nothing to do this weekend.)

I am part of the production team and want to let as many people as possible know about the production. 

The show runs Wed-Sat 7:30pm, plus a 3:30pm show on Sat &amp; Sun. It's a fun show: fast paced and genuinely funny. [Previous cast's reviews](http://www.thepublicreviews.com/the-complete-works-of-shakespeare-abridged-%E2%80%93-new-red-lion-theatre-london/) were mostly favourable.

Check us out. We are on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Complete-Works-of-William-Shakespeare-Abridged-at-the-New-Red-Lion/106586226085919) &amp; [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/@thecompletework) too.

And if you're interested tickets can be purchased on the door for only £5 using our ""Shakespearean Insult of the Day"" updated from our [Twitter page](http://twitter.com/#!/@thecompletework).

It is also worth mentioning that reddit has already left its mark on the theatre: a reddit alien has already been drawn on the wall of the gents toilet.

I love the music and I think that it has several strong and important messages for young girls. There is one problem... there are 2 black girls who attend this camp and neither of them seem to have any interest in the drama program. Everyone is white, seriously. My one idea would be to have everyone playing a white character wear white for the whole show and everyone who is black wear black the entire show until the last number then everyone suddenly changes into to great colorful stuff. With an abstractish set to let the audience know that they should use their imagination. Is this feasible in the least, I hate to let this show go just because we don't have gender diversity at camp...but is it possible to do Hairspray with an all white cast?",,False,self,t5_2quc9,False,,,True,t3_j66bt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/j66bt/hairspray_with_white_folk/,

The fact that the editors allowed this to be published is unacceptable.  It has only been removed from the site after a big push of negative publicity.  The next step is to prevent this person from continuing to publish his bile.

The amazing thing is I'm not even a big fan of the show 'In the Heights,' but criticize the show for its content, not the races or cultures of the people who are in it.
