&gt; I know that we also have /r/soccer, but this seems like a very unappreciated subreddit. Is there a better one to use for American soccer?

In the time since, /r/MLS has gone from ""very underappreciated"" to one of the best places online to talk about American soccer.  Whether you're new to the sport or the league, or have been here since 1996, our community is diverse, insightful, and welcoming.  

And today, less than a week before 2013 First Kick, we've passed a huge milestone of **having 10,000 subscribers**.

On behalf of the moderation team, thank you all so much for making this such a great community.  It's your posts and comments every day that keep this place interesting.

Here's to the 2013 season, and many more to come.

**We'd love to hear about positive experiences you've had here - if you learned something, had a good laugh, made a professional connection, whatever, let us know.**

Also, since it's a work day for most people, we've decided to launch the thread about an hour early to give people at work ample time to submit their questions so Alexi can answer them.

Finally, Alexi reserves the right to not answer anything he doesn't wish to and we, the moderators, WILL be looking out for trolls, spam, or other questions deemed inflammatory or inappropriate. 

Have fun and we'll update when Alexi begins answering questions. Feel free to upvote questions you really want answered.

Here's his official Twitter update to confirm: http://twitter.com/#!/alexilalas22/status/51327799285399552

**P.S. Thank ItsSchlim for organizing this!**

**UPDATE:** Alexi will be answering questions starting now. Remember answering is at his discretion.

**UPDATE 2:** We've assigned AlexiLalas a COSMOS Crest to better highlight his answers since not many people use that crest and it is highly visible. Nobody take this for anything than what it is... sorry NYRB fans. :p

**UPDATE 3:** Alexi is finished answering questions for now. I'd like to thank him for spending almost 2 hours of his day answering all our questions about MLS and the USMNT. Feel free to keep asking questions, although I can't guarantee he'll answer them.

**From Alexi Lalas:**

""Pleasure to be with you on Reddit.com. At first I felt I was
descending into a dark and dangerous on-line alley. Now I know I got
invited into one of the coolest underground clubs (and got a VIP

than buying a sports-car. Let's do it again soon. Thanks for fighting

(Just 23 days!)",dyljm2,242,31,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/182kqk/alright_ive_got_a_proposal_for_this_subreddit/,"I was thinking about MLS last night and realized that I don't know the league as well as I would like. I only started following closely at the end of last season and only got a chance to watch the Rapids play three or four times last year. It led me to think that /r/MLS might be a good resource for me to understand the league a little better. 

My proposal is that this subreddit specifies a day during which the community of /r/MLS can discuss each individual team in the buildup to the new season. By that, I mean that every day we will have a thread dedicated to one team and we can discuss their outlook on this season, both from the point of view of an outsider and a club supporter. It would be valuable to most of us to learn about other teams around the league, I think.

I would suggest that we proceed alphabetically, meaning that the Chicago Fire would be first, starting on Sunday. This would leave enough time for each team to have a thread dedicated to them before the season starts and we have one big general discussion thread on the eve of the first matches. 

Content of the threads would hopefully talk about likely squads and formations, fan mood, interesting details about the club, and how /r/MLS thinks the club will fare during the season.

I'll be back to discuss more later tonight, but I gotta go to work. Let's give this a shot!

**EDIT:** Hey guys, just got back from work (K Mart was bumping today), and I am absolutely loving the discussion and reception in this thread. Several people have had questions regarding the general format. I don't think there needs to be anything absolutely required of the thread creators, but let's say I'm doing the bare minimum for my made up team...

.......................

Team: Townsville Citizens

Location: Townsville, Stateland

Head coach: Bob Joe Bill

Formation: 4-3-3

Doug------Dan---------Fred

Henry------Albert-------Eddy

Chuck---Andy-----Jack---Phil

------------John-------------

Key players: Fred, Jack

*[Brief description of season outlook]*

I think that could be enough for a very basic thread. Of course, there is a lot of room for anyone to go above and beyond. Again, thanks to everyone for their ideas!

2. Join the American Outlaws in order to be a good fan and participate in the game.

3. Buy tickets in the AO supporter section.

4. Wait in anticipation for two months.

5. Realize that you don't have a jersey to wear to the game a few days before the game.

6. Order one of the waldo jerseys (it's actually very nice looking, I'd definitely recommend it) and pay for expedited shipping, forgetting that Memorial Day means no shipping for UPS.

7. Start freaking out that your jersey won't arrive in time for you to get to the game.

8. Check UPS tracking number every 15 minutes while at work to see if it arrives.

9. Once the jersey lands, rush home and take off for the game, leaving plenty of time to find parking, walk to the stadium, and watch the teams warm up.

10. Listen to podcasts about the game on the way to the game.

11. After you're halfway to the stadium, **REALIZE YOU FORGOT YOUR F@#&amp;ING TICKET ON YOUR REFRIGERATOR!**

12. Call significant other, arrange for desperate ticket swap somewhere on the highway.

13. Halfway to ticket swap, significant other realizes they forgot your ticket too.

14. Realize a pit of sadness within yourself, be resigned that you're going to have to watch the game on TV (aka stream) and that you were kidding yourself with the ticket swap and were never going to make it before the first half was over anyway.

15. On the way back home, purchase your choice of liquor to soothe yourself (I chose a Glenlivet 12 year).

Positives? I'll never make that mistake again. Glad that it wasn't a qualifying game. Will definitely not be making the same mistake with USA vs. Mexico in September, assuming I can get ahold of a ticket.

2.) [A NIGHT SIGN](http://worldwideskyadvertising.com/Scrolling-LED-Flying-SIGN.html). $675 for 15 minutes, $1000 for 45 minutes. We can change this to anything with as much as 40 characters.

3.) [BANNER](http://worldwideskyadvertising.com/Aerial-Banners.html). $605 for 35 minutes and 35 characters.

Due to overwhelming response by you and an expressed preference from the Black Army, we'll be flying a scrolling [**LED night sign**](http://worldwideskyadvertising.com/Scrolling-LED-Flying-SIGN.html) reading **""FUERA VERGARA #VERGARAOUT""** on **6/23 from 8:45-9:05pm pst** (Halftime).

I myself had some misgivings about this (Visibility, light pollution, helicopter noise, photography, giving an excuse for a ref to delay game, etc, etc,), but these have all been put to bed after some back and forth with the skywriting agent. ALSO, I was surprised to hear they've flown this type of sign over the (former) Home Depot Center several times in the past, and here's them on that:

&gt;The night sign would be brightly visible. We have flown this event several times in the past and remains with excellent visibility. The sign is beneath a 45' wingspan of a airplane.

The plane will be flown from the north to be visible from the stadium's south end. I've spoken with the Black Army prez, and he's agreed to be the skywriter's contact person on the ground. 

**I want to make it clear that the Black Army has signed off on all of this and is extremely grateful to all contributors.**

Next steps will clearly be getting the word out as the event approaches. Overall, we've raised $715. Minus fees, we should have about $20ish left to throw at MLS Works. I'll update this thread with transaction receipts as they happen. Congratulations!

EDIT: Much love to whoever gave me the ""Vergara Protest King"" flair.

Key players: 
In this team there are so many key players it's hard to just list one or two.  We have no stars so everyone needs to show up.  
If MacDonald can score goals, we'll be a good team.  If he continues his lack of scoring from last year, we'll need to come up with goals from somewhere else (like usual).  I think from CM up through MacDonald we will need good performances from all those players if we are to be contenders.

* Grazzini, loaned to an Argentina club, who knows why, the drama around the whole episode was surreal and inexplicable
* Puppo, loaned to a Uruguay club, wasn't good enough
* Cory Gibbs, retired, missed all last year with an injury and decided to call it a career
* Dominic Oduro, traded to CBUS, didn't fit the system quite right, trouble finishing, wanted to be a starter.
* Dan Gargan, released and picked up by SJ, I honestly have no idea.  I thought he was a very solid player in a spot where we had little depth.


Season:

Last season we started quite good and actually were near the top of the east for the entire season but toward the end we really fell off.  On the last game of regular season we fell into the wildcard spot and promptly lost the wildcard playoff game at home.  The team lost key players during the season and failed to find a consistent goal scorer (nothing new for the Fire) couple that with a bunch of signings that didn't pan out and the year was a real mixed bag.

We paid a transfer fee for striker Federico Puppo, which ended up making him count as a DP for us, but he almost never played.  He was quickly loaned back to Uruguay.  We also brought in Rafa Robayo, who was billed as a box to box midfielder.  On paper, he should have been fantastic.  Still in his prime, captain of a very good Millionarios team, getting callups for the Colombian national team.  Well, he was pretty crappy.  His attitude was also crap.  He complained about MLS in the papers and was soon sent packing back to Colombia.  Our CM play maker, Sebastian Grazzini somehow ended up leaving the team in the middle of the season.  He said goodbye to the fans after being subbed one game with a slogan on his t-shirt, and then never played again, even though the club said he was going to pickup his option, which it did.  Then, he returned home for ""personal reasons"".  He claimed that he didn't understand his contract or something.  It's all very weird.  Marco Pappa had already signed a contract to play for SC Herenveen in the following year, but the Fire decided to let him leave early so as to get a transfer fee for him.  To try to help fill the void he left we traded for Flaco Fernandez from Seattle (another DP).  He wasn't any good and soon had the fans angry at his constant turnovers, missed opportunities, and overall sloppy play.  Thankfully we got rid of him.  

Some of the signings that have stuck with the team include the return of Chris Rolfe, the left footed brazilian Alex, and target forward Serjill MacDonald.  Rolfe joined a month or 2 into the season, and still finished as our leading goal scorer with only 8 IIRC.  Alex is a decent young little attacking player who might be playing on the left instead of the middle this year.  MacDonald was a player who fit the formation that Klopas wants to play, with a big forward who can hold up play.  He did that part of the job very well, but failed to show a cutting edge when presented with opportunities to score (a common feature of chicago fire players).

Oduro had scored 18 goals in the last 2 years, more than anyone else on the team by a long way, but I can only assume that he wanted a move to get more playing time.  I definitely think CBUS got the better of this trade.

Brining in Larentowicz and Lindpere could prove to be a significant move to improve our team.  For years the Fire supporters have lamented the fact that our center midfield can't (or wasn't allowed to) produce anything on the offensive side of things.  Logan Pause never met a backpass he didn't like, and when you have a team that is constantly without a forward who can score, the lack of any attack coming from CM really hurts the offense.

Lindpere and Larentowicz appear to already be pushing the ever-present Logan Pause out of midfield and into the RB spot, where we are especially thin.  I'd honestly rather have Gargan playing there, so I have no idea why he was let go.

Last year Austin Berry, who won Rookie of the Year, was absolutely phenomenal.  He was always a threat on corners, which is something the Fire have lacked for years, and his ability to win balls in the air while defending against forwards who are playing with their back to goal was nothing short of fantastic.  I look for him to continue to dominate on defense, and probably score 3-5 goals.

Former German International Arne Friedrich is back and will probalby play next to Berry (with Anibaba giving cover, if he doesn't play RB).  If you watch the Fire, you'll see something in Friedrich that you almost never see in an MLS game, and that is a CB taking the ball up into the midfield, making an offensive pass, and continuing his run into the attacking third.  Great to see.

Rolfe should get about 10 goals, so long as he can avoid getting kicked to death by the other teams enforcers, which is his problem more than anything else really.

Who will play on the left?  I have no idea.  I hope Klopas has a good idea.

Sean Johnson will likely be missing games as it looks like he's wrapped up 3rd spot on the national team (deserving in my opinion).

The Fire once again have failed to make any big DP signings, and the fans continue to pine for a top quality striker, of which we haven't had one in a decade, but it's looking like another season of hoping for goals by committee.  We could be quite good this year.  We have players at all positions who can do the job, it will be a question of how the 2 new CMs perform, and if MacDonald can convert more of his chances.



If you have any questions I'll be back online later and hopefully can answer them.


EDIT: adding some stuff from peoples suggestions.

The Fire on Twitter can be found with @ChicagoFire and with the hashtag #CF97.

Some of the Fire related sites that I frequent are:

http://chicago-fire.com of course

http://section8chicago.com Our main supporter group

http://www.chicagonow.com/fire-confidential/

http://www.hottimeinoldtown.com/


Stadium, atmosphere:

Toyota Park is mostly awesome.  It seats 20,000.  The negatives of it are that it's in Bridgeview, which is not all that easy to get to from the city, the people running parking and traffic are incompetent to a degree I thought was impossible, and various parts of the stadium where fans need to walk don't drain properly, so if it's raining, you might be wading through 2"" of water.  Some complain about the $15 parking, I don't really care about that.  Public transportation sucks to get there.

The field is flawless.  World class.  It has pipes underneath that drain water away when it rains, and that they use to pump warm air through when it's cold to keep the field from freezing.

Our main supporter group is Section 8, and they sit in the N (Harlem End).  We have a weird thing going with our supporter groups in that a lot of the latinos in S8 felt they were the target of some racist attitudes of the security staff that patrols that area, so they splitered off and formed ""Sector Latino"" and they sit in the SW corner.  Personally, I think it's a shame, because they usually don't do anything in coordination with S8, so all the noise they make usually just bleeds together with what S8 is doing and kinda counteracts what everyone is trying to achieve, almost like an away supporters group would do.  But they give opponents taking a corner in the SW hell, which is nice.


Best Case Scenario:

MacDonald tightens up on his shooting and scores 10+ goals.  Our 2 new CMs bolster our attack and take pressure off Rolfe so he can play more like a withdrawn striker and less like a CM (and in the process, not get the backs of his legs kicked so much).  Nyarko does what he always does and terrorizes the other team (and avoids concussions this year).  Whoever we play on the left doesn't let the team down, and our back 4 stay healthy.  I think if that happens we'd contend for all trophies.

Worse Case Scenario:

MacDonald provides more evidence that he can't finish, and Maicon Santos isn't any better.  Rolfe gets hurt (which tends to happen when you get kicked every game over and over) and Nyarko gets another concussion.  Duka turns into a malcontent on the Fire and disrupts the lockerroom.  Our 2 new CMs don't gel, and Klopas is left trying to find a way to get the team to play.  We get some injuries on the back line and we are exposed for having very little depth, and our backup keeper Tornagi (who has shown himself to be very good previously) doesn't perform well when Johnson is away, and we leak goals.  If lots go wrong, I still don't think we would be TorontoFC-or-Chivas-USA-2012 bad, but we'd probably be bottom 3rd of the league.


Key Substitutes:

Tornagi (GK) I assume he'll be playing when Johnson is called up.  Last year in a similar situation he was fantastic so hopefully he continues that. 

Anibaba (RB, CB) Even if he doesn't start, he'll see a lot of minutes one way or another.  Last year he looked good at CB, and maybe a bit exposed at RB.  He'll be the first one to play if a defender is hurt, or he might even be a starter.

Alex (Midfield attacking) I'm going to assume Alex will be one of the first sub opportunities when we need more in the attack.  He's good on the dribble, and has a very nice left footed shot.  

Hunter Jumper (Defender) Our cover on the left is pretty weak.  Hunter played a bit last year but not too much.  If Segares picks up a knock, he'll probably need to hold down the left back position.

1360622119.0,130,self.MLS,18c4u8,Chivas USA! (r/MLS Countdown to Kickoff),,160,30,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/18c4u8/chivas_usa_rmls_countdown_to_kickoff/,"**Overview**

October 20, 2007: On the final day of the season, Chivas USA hosts the Houston Dynamo at the Home Depot Center, a battle royale that will determine which squad will snag the top seed in the Western Conference.  Disaster strikes Chivas early; Lawson Vaughn earns a red card in the 40th minute for “Serious Foul Play”.  Despite playing the second half with 10 men, however, Chivas still bests Houston in shots on goal by a 2-1 margin, and when the final whistle sounds, the Rojiblancos have earned a scoreless tie, winning the Western Conference by a single point in front of 16,853 fans.

What happened?  At one point, it looked like Chivas USA could legitimately be the future of MLS.  A young, up-and-coming team already beginning to bloom in its third season.  A cadre of screaming fans.  An audacious experiment in cross-cultural sport coming to fruition.

The Goats made the playoffs in four of their first five seasons... and then it was over.  The past three seasons have seen Chivas USA finish no higher than eighth, bottoming out in last year's pathetic 29 point performance in which they scored only 22 goals in 33 league games.  The soccer was flat and uninspired, and following a 1-0 victory in Portland on July 28th, Chivas would not win a single game for the rest of the year.

So, again, what happened?  Answers are hard to come by; Chivas USA is perhaps the least written-about team in the league.  What does exist is heavily biased by preconceived notions of what Chivas should be, or why it's been doomed to failure since its inception.  To much of the US soccer community, Chivas USA is a potpourri of racism, cheapness, vanity, and irrelevancy, stuck in the towering shadows of Guadalajara and the Galaxy.  Just look at how many Chivas rumors spread through the MLS blogosphere this off-season alone, only to be proven false in short order: that Vergara was looking to sell both teams, that Dan Kennedy was about to be traded, that Juan Agudelo's tranfer to Celtic was imminent, the the team would copy Guadalajara's Mexican-only policy.  I know that every team receives this kind of speculation in the off-season, but in Chivas's case, every story gets rehashed time and time again as evidence of the organization's mal-intent, with the assumption that each would have come true were it not for the outcry that followed.    But the team has seen more positive buzz than usual over the past few months as well, spurred by a rebuilding program that's reached to the highest levels of the organization.

I fear that the team is destined to fall short of expectations again (or, alternatively, to meet the expectations of the many who believe the “new Chivas” is as doomed as the old).  It's unfortunate, because they'll be bad for the “right reasons” this year.  A full franchise rebuild doesn't happen overnight, and the organization has made it clear that their first priority has been to cull the dead weight from the team.  Is this a responsible renewal, or a disengagement from a team which is already on thin ice with both its fans and the broader MLS community?  Unfortunately, I don't believe we'll know for sure this year.  Chivas USA fans can take heart in a successful preseason, however, and a team that looks like it will, for better or worse, challenge conventional MLS wisdom yet again.

**Front Office**

To me, hearing about Jorge Vergara is like stumbling on your siblings' porn folder – you may be curious, but you're also certain that you're happier not knowing.  Everyone with an opinion on Vergara has nothing but the worst things to say about him, so I fear that if I spend to much time researching him, I'll just get depressed.  What I do know, however, is that since he and his wife Angelica Fuentes bought out Antonio and Lorenzo Cue in mid-August, the course of the team has been radically shifted.  The brothers were each actively involved in the team's day-to-day operations (Antonio was the team's president; insert lousy pun about Chivas “taking its Cue from him” here), so I'm hopeful that they were a bigger part of the problem than most people realized.

Vergara started his reorganization in the front office, with the biggest appointment probably being Dennis te Kloese as Sporting President for Chivas USA (and Guadalajara).  Te Kloese first worked with Chivas USA in 2003, and his familiarity with the American game is critical with an organization more familiar with Mexican soccer.  He's also committed to strengthening the ties between the two Chivae, something that, contrary to popular opinion, had suffered in recent years.  [From a recent article](http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/02/07/gringo-report-te-kloese-reveals-chivas-usa-masterplan): “Te Kloese has opened up virtually every department at the Guadalajara club to its northern sister. That means that the medical, nutrition, scouting, youth development and administration expertise that exists in Guadalajara will be extended to Chivas USA and the heads of each area will split their time working between the two clubs.”  Taking advantage of the substantial Guadalajara infrastructure has already paid off in the form of a host of young, Latin-American trialists who were largely off the radar of the American soccer establishment (articles about them have read [more like detective stories than scouting reports](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/identities-chivas-usas-mystery-trialists-090727665--mls.html)).

**Coaching Staff**

Chivas's most important new acquisition isn't a player or administrator, but a coach: José Luis Sanchéz Solá, nicknamed “Chelís” (a shortened form of “José Luis”).  By now, you've certainly heard of Chelis's penchant for plain-spoken declarations and quips in delightfully ragged English, and that's just the way Chivas wants it to be.  They've made Chelis the face of the rebuilding Chivas; he anchors an uncertain roster, connects the team to its Hispanic origins and fanbase, and comes off as just plain likable, a necessity for a team that needs any bit of positive press.

Chelis favors a quick, pressing style of play, designed to force turnovers and maximize shots; consequently, trainings have emphasized conditioning.  He is devoted to the idea of exciting soccer, going so far as to say putting on a show for the fans is even more important that winning to him (though he is quick to point out that his bosses in the front office consider the results paramount).  He also believes in an inclusionary vision of Chivas's Mexican connection; instead of severing ties with non-Mexican players, he hopes to make Chivas a particularly desirable destination for Mexican-American players, emphasizing this as a connection with the team's Southern Californian home rather than a single-minded ethnic focus.  This stance is paying off; several high-profile Mexican-American prospects, including eventual draftee Carlos Alvarez, publicly stated their preference to play for Chivas before the draft.

Whether Chelis's style will transition to the American game is one of the most fascinating subplots of the upcoming season, and I hope that Chivas USA gives him a longer leash than some previous coaches as he continues to mold the roster to his preferences.  As of now, he has continued to express enthusiasm for his current roster, asking the front office to hold on to all 29 players currently in camp.  However, he has also insisted that this year will be one of shedding payroll, and that Vergara has promised to open up the checkbook for some blue-chip players in the years to come.

As an aside, I also want to address [this article about the firing of assistant coach Carlos Llamosa](http://www.soccerbyives.net/2013/02/llamosa-bright-cosmos.html), which has made the round of the MLS blogosphere over the past few days.  There's no doubt that Llamosa was treated unfairly, and I'm glad to hear that he's been able to land on his feet on a team with an exciting future.  However, I also think the situation needs to be seen in context; his dismissal came in the midst of a frantic transitional period, and was less than two weeks after te Kloese had taken over as the new club president.  It was more rushed, hamfisted transition than sustained dishonesty.  Still, I hope it's a learning experience for the team.

**Goalkeeper**

I don't think any player in MLS means more to his fans than Dan Kennedy does to Chivas USA.  He's not just our reigning player of the year, a bona fide all-star who saved us time and time again.  He's not just the building block of our team, the brick wall that allows us to press because we know we have a solid line of defense.

Dan Kennedy is our totem, the spinning top that lets us know we're not in a nightmare, that supporting Chivas USA doesn't necessarily mean surrendering our sanity.  In the dark days of October and November, when the words “Gringo firesale” were being tossed around to describe our allegedly cheap and racist organization, Kennedy's substantial paycheck and aggressively Irish name painted a bright red target on our undisputed fan favorite.  When rumors swirled that he was next on the transfer list, many feared that the team had finally and irrevocably given up on becoming a legitimate contender.  And when Chelis named Kennedy our captain and the cornerstone of the team, it began the “Chivaisssance”, the sustained run of positive news that has reignited interest in the team.  Still, Kennedy's departure represents a sustained neurosis for the fanbase; the wonderful Alicia Ratterree, who writes for the indispensable Chivas blog The Goat Parade, [sounds more like a hostage than a soccer fan](http://www.thegoatparade.com/2013/1/28/3926598/a-meditation-on-time-and-dan-kennedy) as she searches for clues that Kennedy might stay in red-and-white (in my mind, trying to parse Chelis's English is as futile as having Lieutenant Dan take a free kick).

If Chivas USA has another wretched season, it won't surprise me if Kennedy does leave at some point; in the context of rebuilding, it may even make sense.  Backup keepers Tim Melia and Patrick McLain aren't particularly accomplished, but rumors of promising young talent from Mexico do give us a ghost of a backup plan.

**Defense**

Even Dan Kennedy wasn't enough to hide the failings of the Chivas defense in late 2012; the Goats gave up four or more goals five times during the end-of-season slide, and went three months without notching a single clean sheet.  Consequently, the back line has seen the greatest overhaul so far this offseason.  Gone are John Valencia and Danny Califf, and Rawshaun McKenzie and Ante Jazic will probably join them soon; remaining with the club are Bobby Burling (I'd rather see him as a depth option) and James Riley (very solid, but getting up in years).

What the eventual roster will look like is up in the air, but there are several promising trialists who figure to play big roles as the season progresses.  Mario de Luna is a 25-year-old center/left-back from Guadalajara who has gotten several starts in the preseason and has shown flashes of brilliance.  Steve Purdy is a former Portland Timber who has appeared with the El Salvador national team and has a reputation as a solid tackler.  Emilio Oroszco has played with the United States U-17 and U-20 teams and spent last year in Fort Lauderdale on loan from Tigres de UANL.  The very promising Juan Pablo Ocegueda is rumored to come from Guadalajara now that he's chosen the US national team over the Mexican (yes! and yes!).  How all of these players will fit together is anyone's guess, but some structure should emerge as the preseason continues.

**Midfield**

Miller Bolaños is just 22 years old, but he has started the preseason on fire, scoring two goals against the Santa Clarita Storm, one against the Chicago Fire, and two against Gangwon FC so far.  After scoring three goals in 24 appearances last year, he could provide some unexpected offense to lead a young group that includes No. 2 overall pick Carlos Alvarez, former Generation Adidas member Eric Avila (acquired from Colorado), former US Developmental Academy Player of the Year Marvin Iraheta, and seveth-year Goat Jorge Villafaña, each 25 years old or less.  Chelis' system is likely to put a lot of pressure on the midfielders to spend the full 90 minutes at great pace, so young legs could help overcome inexperience.

I think that Ben Zemanski's performance will be critical for Chivas USA to succeed this year.  At 24-years-old, he's already played 72 games in a Chivas uniform, and if Chelis uses a 3-5-2 formation as is rumored, a defensive specialist midfielder like Zemanski will be invaluable.  Oswaldo Minda has also filled that role in the past, and [The Goat Parade is particularly effuse in his praise](http://www.thegoatparade.com/2012/12/30/3815588/chivas-usa-2012-player-postmortem-oswaldo-minda); he could be the glue that holds the midfield together.  Laurent Courtois provides some much-needed experience, having played at clubs like West Ham and Levante.  And finally, there's the train-wreck that is the Shalrie “The Salary” Joseph situation, so nicknamed because that is all he represents to Chivas at this point.  Joseph's role in MLS history is unimpeachable, but he was horrible for Chivas after coming in a mid-season trade, and Chelis has been adamant that The Salary doesn't feature in his plans for this year.  It seemed that both sides would find an amicable separation after Joseph spent a few days in Sounders training camp, but his play there [inspired this review](http://www.sounderatheart.com/sounders-trades-transfers-rumors/2013/2/9/3971514/shalrie-joseph-sounders-trial-over): “Obviously it's very evident that he hasn't trained in a while, it's evident that he's very much behind physically as well”.  As a result, the Sounders deal seems increasingly unlikely, and Joseph and Chelis could find themselves stuck in a marriage that neither wants to continue.  Would he contribute anything to Chivas, or even show up to play at all?  It's probably in everyone's best interest that we don't need to find out.

In the first week of what was to be a month long trial, we have anecdotally observed the following:

1. It did not adversely affect the number of comments in the average match thread.
2. It did reduce the number of posts that were spiked with downvotes.
3. It did not reduce the number of posts that were widely upvoted.
4. There was a vocal outcry from a number of community members that they strongly disliked the feature.

While 1-3 are all good, 4 was bad enough to overshadow any good the function was achieving.

As such, the mod team has agreed to end the trial and disable the feature as of this morning.

What's most impressive (to me, anyhow) is that we just passed 5000 at the beginning of April; and we hit 3,000 last August.  That's 20% growth in two months, and 100% growth in ten.  That's huge, and it speaks to the momentum of the league, US Soccer, and Reddit over the last few years.

Huge thanks to each and every one of you.  You guys keep this place full of fascinating links and thoughtful discussion, day in and day out.

* **30'** [](/BOSNIA) [](/goal) Ibisevic puts a nice header on goal and into the net.

1347371693.0,110,self.MLS,zpi0t,The Unintended Consequences of the Growth of American Soccer,IWillKickU,123,13,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/zpi0t/the_unintended_consequences_of_the_growth_of/,"Like everyone else, the recent loss to Jamaica has got me thinking.  How did this happen?  American soccer was supposed to be on the rise.  Our league is growing and improving in terms of size, quality, interest, and revenue.  Our minor leagues are growing in those same categories.  Our export players are moving to bigger clubs every season.  Our National Team is winning in some of the world's toughest away stadiums.  How could we possibly lose to a tiny Caribbean country where soccer isn't even the most popular sport?

How this happened has already been answered in asking the question.  American soccer does not grow alone.  During this international break 49 MLS players were called up to 17 countries, nearly all in CONCACAF, **Including nine players to the Reggae Boyz!**

Before MLS came along the Jamaican National team was largely made up of players playing in the 3rd or 4th division of England, or semipro leagues in the Caribbean.  Now there is a fully professional league, close to home, where there is already a very large Jamaican diaspora, either Jamaican immigrants, or children of immigrants who have declared for Jamaica.  Essentially, MLS is a league that Jamaica can call it's own.

But Jamaica isn't alone.  Our country has huge communities of pretty much every Latino nationality in pretty much every major city.  All of them play soccer recreationally and MLS is the natural destination for those who have professional potential.  

Of course MLS has also become a destination for CONCACAF players who are looking to move up in the world.  After only 17 years MLS has become the second best league in CONCACAF behind only Liga MX, in terms of quality and revenue.  20 years ago a very high potential young CONCACAF player like Andy Najar's only option would have been playing in Honduras and trying to break into the Mexican league or maybe South America.  Now MLS in a very attractive intermediate option.  In terms of international recruiting and player developement potential, I don't think of MLS as behind Liga MX, rather as 19 more teams that can be options for quality players to find a quality team.  

Some countries have opted to export entire teams to the US.  Both Puerto Rico and Antigua have no fully pro leagues, but each field a pro team in the US soccer pyramid.  20 years ago this would have been completely impossible.  Now tiny countries like Antigua are capable of scoring a goal, on the road, against one of the region's elite.

Every year Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica send their best domestic teams to compete against Liga MX and MLS teams in what is *finally* a real competition, the Champions League.  To see how this improves things one needs look no further than Dallas's Blas Perez.  He beat the crap out of Dallas in the 2011-12 CCL, only to be recruited by them the next year.  This year he is playing MLS teams every week, rather than the vastly inferior Panamanian competition.  He is only going to improve in MLS and make Panama better.  Along with Carlos Rodriguez also of Dallas, and Gabriel Gomez of Philly, Blas is now poised to take Panama to their first Hex since 2006.

Even Mexico, our bitter CONCACAF rival,  has benefited from the rise of American soccer.  The Champions Cup used to be the only regional competition that Mexican clubs could take part in.  No one gave a blue crap about  the Champions Cup.  Most teams didn't even send their first teams to compete.  For real competition Mexico had to enter the Copa Libertidores, where they were outmatched and thousands of miles from home.  Now they have the Champions League.  Although every time an MLS team beats a Mexican team we still have to suffer through ""Mexican clubs don't care about the CCL,"" it's simply not true.  Even if Liga teams don't play their first team, the CCL still plays an important part of Mexican development.  It gives young players and reserves a chance to play against vastly improved Central American first teams, as well as MLS teams.  These reserves could be starters for the National Team in 3 or 4 years time.  It's a much higher level of competition for Mexico's player development than was available 20 years ago.  It's no wonder that they have improved almost as dramatically as the USA has since the formation of MLS.  

Does all of this regional growth mean that USA should have lost to Jamaica last Friday?  No.  We still should outplay Jamaica every time we play them.  But it at least explains why we are seeing upsets more and more often in CONCACAF.  And I fully expect that trend to continue.  By the 2020s I don't think that Qualification will not be taken for granted by either USA or Mexico.  But if anything we should not mourn the fact that the region isn't going to be a two horse race any longer.  We should celebrate that we will be privy to *real* competition within CONCACAF moving forward.",,False,self,t5_2rbnb,1347378218.0,,richmond-kickers,True,t3_zpi0t,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/zpi0t/the_unintended_consequences_of_the_growth_of/,

You would think an upstart league like MLS would be eager to fill this sports vacuum...instead we get two non-rival matches tonight, neither of which is broadcast nationally.

MLS has a July-August window to maximize exposure of the league. Why they don't take advantage of this lull, I don't understand. Imagine if they were to put back-to-back rivalry matches on NBCSN today, and tomorrow on ESPN.

I'm guessing that there's more than a few contractual and/or logistical issues, but if MLS want to continue attracting more exposure, they need to get smart about utilizing these opportunities to get in the face of potential new fans.",,False,self,t5_2rbnb,False,,seattle-sounders,True,t3_1ij1up,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/1ij1up/another_mlb_allstar_break_another_wasted/,

I asked a LA skywriter for a quote and am expecting something in the neighborhood of $1500-2000. Either way, this would cost everyone on /r/mls **less than 20 cents each** if we went through with it.

[Here's a screenshot of my quote submission](http://i.imgur.com/ajrYqX7.jpg). Right now, I'm using a generic ""VERGARA OUT,"" but I'm all ears for better suggestions. Remember: Shorter is probably better.

**UPDATE**: Alright, guys. Heard back from the skywriting people and this is looking good. We have three options: 

1.) [SKYWRITING](http://worldwideskyadvertising.com/Skywriting.html). $4120 for ""Vergara Out,"" lasts 5-7 minutes.

2.) [A NIGHT SIGN](http://worldwideskyadvertising.com/Scrolling-LED-Flying-SIGN.html). $675 for 15 minutes, $1000 for 45 minutes. We can change this to anything with as much as 40 characters.

3.) [BANNER](http://worldwideskyadvertising.com/Aerial-Banners.html). $605 for 35 minutes and 35 characters.

Personally, I'm leaning towards the banner or the night sign. The banner is the classic and the night sign would be PERFECT for the second half of a game the Chivas-Galaxy game on June 23rd.

Thus, I've been an Arsenal FC fan my whole life (secretly named my cat ""Thierry"" but my mom wouldn't have it; PS, you're welcome Red Bull fans). 

However, I was born in Seattle and as such whenever I came home to visit my dad in the United States, I found myself rooting for any Seattle based team. I just felt this was fair; they have a team for just about every sport, Seahawks, SuperSonics (RIP), Mariners, they even integrate the Canucks pretty well.

After living in the US for the past 11 years, I finally moved back home to Seattle. It was only once here that I realized how much Americans can love football, and not the grunty armored kind (which I also learned to love). The US National team made a great run in the World Cup, people were packed into bars to watch the Netherlands/Spain Final. I saw busses and trains *packed* with Sounders fans. I started watching a few matches when they played in bars and tried to learn the players names as they appeared on billboards (they're everywhere up here).

Finally, for my 30th birthday on Sunday my lady bought us Sounders tickets. This past Wednesday I went to my first live MLS match: [LA Galaxy at Seattle Sounders](http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-05-02-sea-v-la/recap). The entire crowd stood for the *whole* game; 39,000 people on their feet for 90 minutes. There was so much energy on behalf of the fans. It felt like being back home in Highbury Square for an Arsenal vs Chelsea match.

I got to watch [this happen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgGMBTgoA2E) from just a few rows up, which was amazing. Even my girlfriend was amazed and couldn't stop jumping; she usually starts snoring any time I talk sports with my guy friends. Afterwards, we agreed: this game was awesome. This league is awesome. It's definitely worth the interest of the American public.

Granted, my heart is still truly tied forever to Arsenal and the Premiership, but I've found some more room in my heart for MLS.

**TL:DR** Lifelong Arsenal fan goes to a Sounders/Galaxy match and finally opens his heart to MLS.",,False,self,t5_2rbnb,False,,seattle-sounders,True,t3_t7xn6,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/t7xn6/alright_rmls_im_convinced_im_no_longer_a_casual/,

United (/r/mls Countdown to Kickoff),stonewallnilgoals,119,13,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/18ihzm/dc_united_rmls_countdown_to_kickoff/,"The eagerly anticipated countdown to kickoff thread for YOUR HOMETOWN D.CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. UNITED! Only fitting that this is scheduled for Valentine's Day, my one true love.

**Team**: D.C. United

**Location**: Southeast D.C.

**Stadium**: Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium (RFK)

**Head Coach**: Ben Olsen

**Captain**: Dwayne De Rosario
**Vice-Captain**: Chris Pontius

**Predicted lineup**:

----------Pajoy--------

-------De Rosario------

Pontius-------------DeLeon

------Saragosa-Kitchen-----

Woolard--Jakovic-McDonald-Korb

---------Hamid-------

**Last Season**: 17W-10L-7D (58 Points, 2nd in the East, eliminated Eastern Conference finals)

The 2012 season was an important one for D.C. United. Looking to end a 4 year playoff drought, having last made it in in 2007, the goal was simply to make the playoffs again. At the beginning of the season, the staff were content with this goal, and most of the fans were. As the season went on, real title aspirations formed, and a top seed and even potentially a Supporter's Shield was still possible with 3 games remaining. Club captain Dwayne De Rosario went down injured on international duty with Canada, spraining his MCL, and would miss the final 12(?) regular season matches and the first 3 playoff matches. In the face of this, Ben Olsen did what he had to do as a coach, and played the kind of soccer you need to to win with what you have. D.C. switched out of it's familiar 4-1-2-1-2 shape into the ""empty bucket"" 4-2-3-1, often leaving Lionard Pajoy isolated up top. This type of soccer has drawn ire from the hardcore fans of the club, but Olsen's tactics, timely substitutions, and clutch moments from role players on DC rode the team on a wave of results, not losing one match since De Rosario's injury until the Eastern Final 1st leg. After going on to defeat bitter arch-rivals New York in possibly the most controversial MLS playoff series of all time, DC would finall succumb to Houston 4-2 on aggregate in the Eastern Finals, exceeding expectations for the year, but still a bit bittersweet looking at how close they had come.

**Key Players**:

Dwayne De Rosario - What can you say about the guy? MLS legend, but entering the twilight of his career. What can he still give? Will he be fit for all 33 games? DC United's captain, and most talented player. Look for him to play the attacking midfield role in a 4-2-3-1 formation.

Chris Pontius - With the team since only 2009, Pontius is now DC's most tenured player. Wide on the left, sometimes up top, he has buckets of talent. Reportedly withdrawn from USMNT camp the past 2 times due to injury, he his just getting better and better every year. Interest in him was claimed from Europe this winter, and DC will do well to hang on to him, especially after his 1st cap. Look for him to do at least a 10 goal 5 assist year at bare minimum.

Bill Hamid - Homegrown goalkeeper. Will be playing in Europe within 2 years. Will likely be fighting Sean Johnson of Chicago for the #3 spot at WC2014, and for the top spot as US keeper for his entire career. Will get at least one red card this year.

Nick DeLeon - outstanding rookie season, playing mostly right midfield. Had a great start, but hit the rookie wall in the middle, and finished very strong scoring twice in the playoffs, including late in New York to win the East Conference Semifinals. Was called into Trinidad and Tobago camp this January, but declined (possibly to hold out for the USA, holds dual citizenship)

Perry Kitchen - For me, DC's MVP last year. Very quickly turning into a top 5 MLS holding midfielder, he shows tremendous leadership qualities, and will only turn 21 just before the season begins. If his progression continues, he will be a staple in the next generation national team setup.

Center back pairing of Dejan Jakovic and Brandon McDonald - last year was the 1st both men have been healthy for the entire season, and formed a very formidable center back pairing. Jakovic is often criticized for being slow and out of position, but he is actually one of the fastest players on the team, and at least once a game will make a superb potential goal saving tackle.

Rafael - a 20 year old Brazilian DP on loan from Bahia. His track record isn't outstanding, but he has the skill set that Ben Olsen wants in his strikers now - hard working and strong.

**Transfers**

Rumblings among the DC faithful are that DC haven't replaced the quality they have lost. Still not convinced we have a striker or a system for the striker to finish in, much of the goal scoring burden will be placed on Pontius, De Rosario, and DeLeon.

**Players Out**:

Branko Boskovic - United's DP signing in 2010, oft injured, but played a major role after De Rosario went down to injury. Won many DC fan's over during the stretch, inlcuding signing a less-than DP salary deal after his contract expired in the middle of the 2012 season. Contract was mutually terminated for family reasons, has returned to Rapid Vienna where he played before joining DC.

Hamdi Salihi - DP striker signed before the 2012 season, had an amazing record of nearly a goal every 2 games in his professional career. His exclusions baffled hardcore DCU fans after watching Pajoy miss the broad side of a barn numerous times. Ben Olsen reportedly didn't like his unwillingness to defend, again a huge part for the striker in this system. Has moved to China.

Andy Najar - DC's wonderkid. First team debut at 16, won rookie of the year on a team having one of the worst MLS seasons of all time. Was sold to Anderlecht of Belgium for a reported $3,000,000 including a generous sell-on fee.

Mike Chabala - Traded for mid season after Daniel Woolard was lost to a concussion. Only made 3 appearences, before DC decided to move Najar to right back, and Korb to the left. Released.

Emiliano Dudar - Reserve center back, played some good matches. Made over $200,000 though, which DC deemed too much for a backup. Option was declined, but offered a reduced salary. Dudar declined and has moved back to Switzerland.

Stephen King - Reserve central midfielder. Not much loss here.

Maicon Santos - strong striker, had a hot start to the season, but fizzled out. Wouldn't have minded holding on to him.

**Players In** -

Rafael - See above

Syamsir Alam - Not much known about him. Very well known player in Indonesia. Shows some talent on Youtube, but not that impressive coming against Singapore u-19 teams.

Taylor Kemp - Left back, DC's draft pick. Will need to be ready to play a large role this season if Woolard's concussion issues return. Looks to have the same role as Chris Korb did when he was drafted 2 years ago.

John Thorrington - central midfielder, acquired from Vancouver in the re-entry draft. Solid career as an MLS player. May challenge for Saragosa's spot in the starting XI.

Michael Seaton - 16 year old striker signed from the academy. Won't see any 1st team action this year bar the Open Cup v. a lower league opponent.

Casey Townsend - Striker from Chivas USA. Acquired for depth, dishing a 2nd round pick, for the #5 overall pick a year ago. Definitely a benefactor of the great white Chivas fire sale.

**Matches to watch for this year**:

New York - oldest rivals, should be very fiery this year especially after the playoff series.

Philly - getting fierce after last year 

Toronto - usually high scoring games with them

**Supporters**:  We have 4 Supporter's Groups: Screaming Eagles and Barra Brava, which can be seen at midfield and to the right of midfield on the TV camera, and La Norte and District Ultras, which can be seen in the left corner of the TV camera.  I believe that we are unique in that our supporter's groups are still at midfield, at field level.  Great seats.  This is mostly due to the fact though that we do not have any endline seats anymore (Thanks Nats).  RFK is also unique in that the seating arrangements are split between the loud side (where all the supporters' groups are located, on the TV camera), and the quiet side (for causal fans, seats further away from the pitch, not much chanting bar a D.C. United chant from a u-10 girls team once in a while, not shown on TV).

Feel free to comment/correct/add anything I have missed here!

Dax went in the first round of the 2006 SuperDraft to FC Dallas, where he spent five seasons and reached an MLS Cup final in 2010.  He was removed from Dallas by the 2010 MLS Expansion Draft when he was selected as the first pick by the Portland Timbers - then was immediately traded to DC for Rodney Wallace.  Midway through the 2011 season, he was sent to New York in exchange for Dwayne De Rosario.  Now in his third season with RBNY, Dax has become a fan favorite, a strong voice in the locker room, and one of the faces of the franchise.  He also has 5 caps for the USMNT.

Get your questions ready (but don't post them yet - this isn't the AMA thread!), mark your calendars for the 15th, and come back here around lunch time to ask Dax whatever you'd like.",,False,self,t5_2rbnb,False,,new-york-red-bulls,True,t3_1jrmat,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/1jrmat/next_rmls_ama_dax_mccarty_of_the_new_york_red/,moderator

**Location:** Columbus, OH

**Head coach:** Robert ""The Polish Rifle"" Warzycha

**Formation:** 4-2-3-1

------------------[Arrieta](http://www.thecrew.com/players/jairo-arrieta)------------------

---Speas--------[Higuain](http://www.thecrew.com/players/federico-higuain)--------[Gaven](http://www.thecrew.com/players/eddie-gaven)---

-----------Sanchez-----O'Rourke-----------

--Viana----Glauber---Marshall---Williams

----------------Gruenebaum----------------

**Key Players:**

* [**Higuain**](http://www.thecrew.com/players/federico-higuain) (DP): The second coming of the Argentine? Maybe. He's a talented playmaker, last season he had 5 goals and 7 assists in 13 games. If he has a good season, the sky is the limit for the Crew this year.
* [**Arrieta**](http://www.thecrew.com/players/jairo-arrieta): Center Forward from Costa Rica, was their leading scorer in the Copa Centroamericana. He joined the Crew midseason in 2012 and in his 18 games he managed to score 9 goals. He also lead the league in offsides, but whatever that doesn't even matter
* [**Gaven**](http://www.thecrew.com/players/eddie-gaven)- For a player who's been in the league since 2003, its hard to believe he's only 26. Last year was also arguably his best. He really came alive once Jairo and Federico arrived and these three will be the centerpiece of the Crew's attack.

**Homegrown Players**

* Speas has the potential to be something special. In college he played for both Akron and North Carolina in their championship years. He’s creative and is looking to replace Dilly Duka on the left wing this season. He does face a tough challenge from Justin Meram for that spot as well. 

* Lampson is our current backup goalkeeper. He filled in admirably for the Hebrew Hammer last season when injured and will continue to develop under him.

* Barson, I don’t know much about him. He’s had some playing time in the preseason so far and has looked pretty decent. Probably wont see too much of him this season except for in case of injury.

* Trapp is possibly the gem of our Academy. Only 19, he will be an integral part of this team for years to come. He signed just this offseason after weighing offers from as of yet unnamed Euro teams. He plays a defensive playmaker type role and I could see him stepping in as one of the two in our 4-2-3-1. However he is expected to miss a large portion of the season with the US u-20’s for the U20 world cup. Definitely a player to look out for in the future. 

* Horton was our first Homegrown player signed, but he might also end up being our first cut. He did not see the field for us or for Dayton in his short loan there last season. The FO is currently letting him trial at Hammarby after failing to secure a season long loan at FK Sarajevo

[**OFFICIAL COLUMBUS CREW CLUB BANGER**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ySbL1eB-EXg)

**A Brief History:** I am probably not the best person to write about the Crew’s early days because I was a toddler, but here goes. Back in 1996 Columbus was the first city to get a MLS franchise. We sold the most season tickets before there even was a club. Some of the great players to play for us at that time was Brian McBride, Brad Friedel, Robert Warzycha, Brian Bliss, Jeff Cunningham, and our first Argentine, Ricardo Irribaren. We didn’t win our first silverware until 2002 when we won the Cup of our founder, the Lamar Hunt US Open Cup. We also managed the Supporter’s shield in 2004. 

We were the first club in America to have a Soccer Specific Stadium. Crew Stadium was built in 1999 for just $40 million in 2013 dollars. It’s located in the fairgrounds and in the middle of Linden so its not premier real estate, but its been our home and I love it. The USMNT has a record of 6-0-3 here and has beaten Mexico 2-0 every time we’ve played them here. They fear us. Dos a Cero.

We suffered for time under the hands of Greg Andrulis and were pretty horrible. Then came our Argentinian savior, Guillermo Barros Schelotto. He joined the league around the same time as Beckham and lead us to our first and only double and our first MLS Cup, 2008. That team, led by Sigi Schmid and composed of names like the aforementioned GBS, Frankie Hejduk, Alejandro Moreno, Chad Marshall, William Hesmer, Brian Carroll, Gino Padula (also Argentinian), Brad Evans, the Robbie Rogers, Duncan Oughton, Eddie Gaven, and many more that I’m blanking on cause its 2 in the morning. 

That team was handed over to Robert Warzycha in the following season. It managed the Supporter’s Shield, but a strange benching of GBS in our first playoff match against Colorado resulted in a troubling defeat, and began a trend of us not advancing since then. 

After 2010 the team was basically disbanded and slowly been built back to what it is now. Only 3 members of the 2008 squad are still with the team today, Chad Marshall, Danny O’Rourke, and Andy Gruenebaum. 

**Philosophy:** As a club, Robert has brought a pretty eastern European style to practice. Benching players for “responsibility.” He prefers to get much of his width from his fullbacks, this year Williams will most likely be on the right and Agustin Viana will most likely be on the left. Wahl might also be an option there if Viana is playing in central midfield. Warzycha also likes set pieces, a left over of his playing days when he was known as the Polish Rifle for his dangerous right boot. Higuain is deadly from anywhere inside 30 yards and rumor has it that this is why he wants Konrad, who for all his failings has a pretty good free kick delivery. I did predict a 4-2-3-1 formation earlier in this write up, but there is also a strong possibility for a 4-4-2 diamond with Oduro and Arrieta paired at the top. Its hard to say, Robert doesn’t typically have qualms about playing a player out of position

As a team owned by Hunt Sports Group, a lot of fans feel like we aren’t getting the attention from ownership that we deserve. Ever since Lamar passed it seems like the Chief’s are occupying more and more attention. Rumors have been swirling about the eventual sale of the team. I hope to God that we stay here. 

**Roster:** Taken from BigSoccer user MLSinCleveland. I thought this was very good. [Full roster break down w/ 2012 salary numbers.]( http://imgur.com/0PJj6LZ)

**New Signings:** 

* Sanchez: This is the one that I'm excited about. He's an extremely proficient midfielder, not a destroyer, but more of a Busquets or Carrick type defensive midfielder. He is what we wanted Mirosevic to be last season. He is a former international for Argentina and looks to be something special for us.

* Viana: I'm not sure where he will play as he has been used at left back and midfield during the preseason. Hopefully he'll solidify himself into a position and be a good contributor. He is Urugayan but was born in Chicago and is a United States Citizen.

* Glauber: He has had a relatively successful career in the Bundesliga and Romanian top division. This Brazilian CB is a cult hero at Manchester City for basically being Rudy. He is composed on the ball and is extremely tall, already scoring once in preseason. With him the Crew have one of the biggest backlines in the league.

* **Other new signings: Finley, Beckie, Wahl, Oduro**

Oduro is replacing Dilly Duka, he provides us one of our first speed options in a really long time. It is yet unkown where he will fit in, up top with Arrieta or as a winger, or as a super sub to run at tired defenses for the last 30 minutes of a match. Wahl has developed decent chemistry with Marshall and will provide depth on the left and center.


**Supporter Atmosphere:** The Crew have three supporter’s groups: Crew Supporter’s Union, Hudson Street Hooligans, and La Turbina Amarilla. All three groups sit together in the Nordecke. HSH and CSU are the larger of the groups with Turbina more focused on our Hispanic supporters


**FOR MORE INFO ON WHY THE TERM MASSIVE IS USED SO MUCH I RECOMMEND READING STEVE SIRK’S ARTICLE: [HERE]( http://www.thecrew.com/news/2012/11/origin-massive)**

**[THE KIRK URSO STORY]( http://www.thecrew.com/news/2012/08/sirks-notebook-kirks-notebook):** Last season, we lost a member of our team in an unforeseeable tragedy. Kirk Urso died of a heart defect last August in Columbus while separated from the team due to injury. The following memorial match was one of the most chilling things I think I’ve ever experienced. The complete silence throughout the fifteenth minute was eerie. RIP Kirk, Forever Massive. 

The Crew is asking for all soccer fans to donate $15 to the Kirk Urso Fund to fund research on congenital heart defects before the Kirk Urso Memorial Match vs North Carolina. If you would like to donate [here is the link](http://www.thecrew.com/ursofund). As someone who’s family has also been affected by congenital heart defects I hope you will be able to contribute.

1339830256.0,94,self.MLS,v4qod,Introducing the MLS Match Thread Generator,Fritzed,102,8,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/v4qod/introducing_the_mls_match_thread_generator/,"I made the mistake of creating a match thread one time, couldn't believe what a hassle it was. I suspect that this is one of the primary reasons that we don't always get a match thread going for every game. In order to avoid this issue, I present to you:  
  
**[The MLS Match Thread Generator](http://hypnotoad.tv/mls/gameThread.html)**  
  
Simply select the teams and the rosters automatically pop up, drag the starters and the bench into the 18 under the appropriate position header. Next fill in the fields provided for TV, Radio, Internet Streams, and Match Previews and hit the big Generate button at the bottom of the page. The full reddit markup for the match thread will appear at the bottom of the page, ready for you to copy and paste.  
  
------------------------------------------------
**NOTE**  
There are almost certainly bugs in this thing. I've put in some basic error catching, but I'm by no means a professional developer and I made this thing relatively quickly. Let me know in the comments if you come across anything significant
  

------------------------------------------------
**TODO**  
There are several things that are missing and that I intend to add if people are using it. Here is  a current todo list:

* Add an input for ""source"" for where you found the 18
* Add an input for selecting the week. It's actually hard coded at the moment at 15
* Update it to automatically determine the home time zones for each team and put them both in the thread.
* Organize the page a bit better, probably into tabs instead of one long page. I also really only looked at this thing in Firefox and hardcoded all the heights and widths as specific pixel counts. There are definitely better ways of doing this.
* Add a section/tab that helps you generate the events in game (i.e. goal scored). I'm thinking a page where you click on a player name and then an event button and it spits out the reddit markup.
* General code fix up - I don't really use jquery much and there are a couple places I used more complicated javascript that could probably be done with jquery functions.
* Make the number of media links dynamic, so that you can add more than 3 of each.
  
I don't really have a timeline for ongoing development, probably depends a on if people are actually using it.  

------------------------------------------------
**FAQ**  

**The roster on my team is wrong, can you fix it?**  
*Absolutely, reply to this thread letting me who should be removed and who should be added. Or, even better, update [the team's json file](http://hypnotoad.tv/mls/teams/) and paste it into a comment here.*
  
  
**Will you be making this work for /s/soccer?**  
*I am ware that /r/soccer may be interested in this as well. After I finish a few of the more important todo items, I plan on making it easier for the tool to handle multiple leagues. It will probably be in quite a bit of flux for the next few days. I have some thoughts on how I can make this easier to use with multiple leagues.*
  
  
**Can I  make a back up of this in case you abandon it some day?**  
*I fully plan on keeping this up to date, but I purposely made it completely in html/javascript so that you can easily save a copy locally. You should be able to run the whole thing on your computer by just saving the ""complete"" web page to your computer.*


------------------------------------------------
**EDIT**  
More todo list items added due to feedback:

* Add in some logic to ensure you have 18 players in the 18 and that 7 of them are on the bench.'
* Add in an ""other"" team option that basically generates empty markup like the template.

Also, a list of things I've fixed since the first post:

* Bullets and links for media sources are correct now
* List of bench players is no longer inappropriately bolded
* Added the team header and social media links for the away team
* URLs now automatically have http:// added if it is missing, since apparently reddit links require this

Most of these are mistakes in my reddit markup, which I guess only justifies this project further.. :P

-------------------------------------------------
**EDIT 2**

* Changed it over to a tabbed interface
* Fixed up some of the code so that pretty much everything is read as a jquery object
* ~~Chrome is a complete pain in the ass for web development. It is caching everything, even when I added no-cache to the header. As long as I'm frequently updating this thing, I recommend any other browser. Seriously google, wtf is the point of a ""reload"" button if it doesn't actually reload the page?~~ Ctrl-F5 on chrome seems to work to bypass the cache.",,False,self,t5_2rbnb,1339915623.0,,seattle-sounders,True,t3_v4qod,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/v4qod/introducing_the_mls_match_thread_generator/,

Pregame: LeToux singing Don't Stop Believin' on the jumbotron.  Things are off to a good start.

1' Kick-off and MLS is legal now boys, and she's looking damn good.

4' Michael Farfan makes a good run but Gabriel Farfan's shot is parried by Nielsen.

9' LeToux gets on the end of a long ball but his chip is over the net.

17' **GOAL Union** LeToux! Nielsen can't keep out the close range shot after a beautiful cross from Daniel. **1-0 Union** [Video](http://www.mlssoccer.com/video/2013/03/02/goal-le-toux-scores-first-goal-2013-mls-season)

22' Marfan played through and puts LeToux 1 on 1 with Nielsen but misses wide.

25'[](//#yellow) **Yellow Card** Collin late with a tackle on Gaddis sets up a Union free kick in a good area.

27' Marfan's free kick nearly beats Nielsen but the shot is parried wide.

41' **GOAL SKC** Zusi! Bieler has his shot saved right to Zusi who puts his shot in the top corner. **1-1** [Video](http://www.mlssoccer.com/video/2013/03/02/goal-zusi-pounces-loose-ball)

45' Bieler's chip goes in but he's called offside.

**Halftime**: Union dominate play but a defensive error has SKC tied.

47' Bieler turns and shoots but the ball is just wide.

56' Daniel plays in a good ball from a free kick but Nielsen is able to punch away.

56' **Yellow Card** Convey takes down Daniel after Daniel wins the ball from him on the wing.

63' **Substitution** Sapong comes on for Convey.

66' **GOAL SKC** Rosell! Uri gets to the cross before MacMath after losing his marker, Gaddis. **2-1 SKC** [Video](http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2013-03-02-PHI-v-SKC/highlights/211962?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=written%252Bpost&amp;utm_campaign=Twitter-MLSsoccer%252Btweet)

70' **Substitution** McInerney on for Garfan.  Union should move from a 4-2-3-1 to a 4-4-2

72' Daniel's shot from a free kick is just a bit too high.

77' Besler almost chests the ball in his own net after a Daniel cross, but Nielsen saves it on the line.

79' McInerney header from a LeToux cross saved by Nielsen.

80' **Substitution** Roger Torres on for Michael Lahoud.

82' **Substitution** Peterson Joseph on for Benny Feilhaber.

83' **GOAL SKC** Bieler! The ball is cut back from the endline by Myers and is calmly finished by Bieler. **3-1 SKC** [Video](http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2013-03-02-PHI-v-SKC/highlights?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=written%252Bpost&amp;utm_campaign=Twitter-MLSsoccer%252Btweet)

84' **Substitution** Connor Casey comes on for Keon Daniel who was the best player for the Union today.

89' **Yellow Card** Gaddis is carded for a reckless challenge on Sapong.

90+1' **Substitution** Mechack Jerome on for Chance Myers.

**Sporting Kansas City wins 3-1** Union dominant in the first half, but didn't take their chances.  SKC took their chances and in the end probably deserve the 3 points.

**Attendance**: 18,160

This is by and large all that anyone knows about the Portland Timbers: Paulson (@MerrittPaulson for those in the know), and the Timbers Army.

##2012

We're coming off what would be generously described as a shit season: second from the bottom in goals scored, third from the bottom in goals allowed, only Chivas and TFC kept us out of the basement. Were this a relegation league, we'd be back in USL. 2011 had seen us go close to the playoffs, so we assumed 2012 would be our playoff year and all would go swimmingly. Our coach John Spencer, a colorful and thoroughly likable Scotsman, brought in the all-time scoring leader from the Scottish Premier League, former Glasgow Rangers striker Kris Boyd. He was made vice-captain, wore the armband on many occasions, and colored the team irrevocably both in terms of his style, his work rate, and his attention span. He had skill, but also low confidence, prone to complete disappearances in games, manifestly unfit, and by the middle of the season, seemingly disinterested in anything other than cashing his paycheck. The rest of the team seemingly took that on, completely failing to show up on numerous occasions, managing -15 goal differential for the first 1/2 of the season, conceding 14 goals in the final 15 minutes of games over the season, looking disorganized, playing desperate balls up the sideline to hit desperate crosses to a striker who ran no channels, did no work, and despite being 6'2 and 190lbs, lost most headers. In mid-July coach John Spencer was fired and General Manager Gavin Wilkinson took over and things got, em, tragic: 8 straight games without a win with 5 straight losses thrown in for good measure, any faint hopes of a playoff appearance vanished. ""Star"" forward Kris Boyd was benched, then injured, then benched, then largely forgotten about, goalkeeper Tory Perkins and forward Jorge Perlaza sent packing, ""GW OUT"" banners blossomed in the North End, Paulson and various members of the TA sniped at each on Twitter. It looked bad. Caleb Porter, erstwhile coach of Akron, was hired with the start date set for January, and much of the end of the season felt somewhat like the aftermath of a late night drunken bike crash: limping homewards, bleeding, dragging a bent wheel, hoping sleep would somehow erase everything. The dark clouds parted a little at the end, just a hint. Porters philosophy-by-proxy and the shape of the team and the parts that would stay started coming together. The late shipping of goals dried up somewhat, several nervy draws and close losses hinted at a team that was at least trying, and finally, for the ~~second~~third time in our MLS history, we won a road game, and this earned us the Cascadia Cup and a tiny piece of solace. Then we watched the playoffs start without us and hit refresh on our browsers as the roster churn began:

##Manager + Tactics

New coach Caleb Porter is an Ajax man, or a Barcelona man, perhaps even a mid-90's Milan man, or, you know, a contemporary soccer man. The age of ""possession and pressure"" is upon us in the US, everyone moving to Mourinho+Chelsea era 433 if not Barcelona-esque 451/460, and we in Portland are no exception to that. We have no outsized stars this time, Porters goal being a quick short passing game that pressures for recovery and moves into the attacking third together, requiring more discipline, intelligence, and diligence than speed, flash, and genius. As we have no stars nor are we likely to get any in the foreseeable future due to our lack of proximity to Manhattan/Hollywood this seems a more promising plan than the Spencer-era ""hoof it to the big man and charge"". We've brought in a slew of new recruits, several of them Akron-ites, and dropped ~6-7 of our starters from last year. Porter himself does an excellent job of conveying a well-mannered polite but serious American Soccerball Coach but if you look at his eyes, he's a man of steely preciseness. He was brilliant building a program at Akron from nothing to arguably the apex of NCAA soccer but it remains to be seen how that will translate to MLS. His brief stint with the US U23s was hamstrung by selection problems, lack of training time, his own mistakes, and bizarre bureaucracy. This is his chance and he knows it.

We'll likely line up 433/4231 with Valeri moving forward and the left &amp; right wings staying back slightly.

              Zizzo/Rincon R.Johnson Valencia

##People to watch 

Diego Valeri - He looks calm, collected, and intelligent without being overly flashy or demanding. If he slots in the Porter system as well as he seems to be doing, then his play will be a very important part of the team being creative and moving the ball from the midfield and into the attacking third. He is no a ""star"", but he will be key both in terms of his positioning and his directing of traffic.

Ryan Johnson - A hat-trick against San Jose showed he might be up for it. We've never had a striker who worked and his track record at Toronto was not golden but Coopers record with us was lackluster while he sparkled in NY, so we might be due some karma. If he stays threatening, we can play our game. Without a reliable option up front the midfield will be forced to push forward into shooting positions and our defensive shape will not be what it needs to be.

Will Johnson - We need to make sure that our high pressure doesn't descend into farce and our possession and movement through the middle of the pitch is meaningful. A lot of this is going to depend on the positioning and understanding of Johnson, Valeri, and everyone else in the middle of the pitch. We're going to be playing a very flexible system but even in the early games you could see that we're going to have two primary pivots: Johnson and Valeri. If they work, we'll work. If not, not. 

Donovan Ricketts - As he demonstrated on duty with the Jamaican national team in Azteca, when he really wants to play and is healthy, he is a very good goalie. As he demonstrated in Montreal and then in Portland, when he's hurt or disinterested he's a liability. Spectacular save after spectacular save followed by howlers that compel one to scream into a clenched fist.

Diego Chara - ""I love me some Diego Chara but if he’s gonna stay on the pitch with Will Johnson and Valeri he’s gonna need to do more than be an engine that kicks the shit out of people and disrupts play."" Our player of the year last year, he came into his own towards the end of last season and when he wasn't on the field destroying anything or one that came near him we lost all shape and ability to control the space 30 yards from our box. A team that desperately needed a leader found one in him. This season however, we're not as leadership-lacking, so he needs to do more than just break up everything and trip people. He most definitely can, the question is whether he will.

Darlington Nagbe - Man-without-a-position and repeat goal of the season contender Nagbe has arrived at his chance to stop being a promising youngster and start being a solid player. Porter was his college coach when he was NCAA player of the year and if he's going to be good, he's going to be good now.

Jose Valencia aka Trencito - He's fast, he's got a good touch, he's big and not afraid to to muscle his way through a backline, and he hasn't started a first team game yet. Signed when he was due for major surgery we've all been waiting to see him and the earliest of indications from the preseason friendlies show that he might be what he's cracked up to be.

##Keys

Move the ball through the middle intelligently. This simply did not happen with regularity at any point last season. Little possession, long hopeful hoofs, and runs up the wings were the blueprint last year and it was excruciating to watch, particularly away from home. Porter is obsessed with moving the ball both laterally and vertically around midfield with confidence and if this happens, we'll do well.

Positional discipline. Last years Timbers almost never controlled space and seemed to only start to attack the ball 2/3 of the way up the field, which was a marvelous way to open space for the opposition. Lots of last ditch defending, utter lack of positional co-ordination, all contributed to completely incoherent performances and embarrassing losses. Some of the main perpetrators of this, Palmer, Songo'o, Smith, are gone. This years model looks far more composed and Porter is rightly obsessed with improving this.

The ""high pressure, high up the pitch, hunt the ball like a pack of wolves"" could be scary with lack of fitness shown last season. This seems like the norm in MLS, but I think we'll be pushing it further than most teams and staying more committed to it through mid and late season. It most certainly may backfire on occasion as our back line is not particularly strong, but I think it will keep us from shipping the quantity of goals that we saw last season. 

Discipline and professionalism have to be better. They can't really get worse, frankly. Last years abysmal road record was largely due to a lack of confidence and an inability to stay mentally in the game. The field resizing will help a little bit but an improvement in discipline will do far far more. 

##Franchise

A abysmal season, a star who was essentially out of the team mid-season, an almost popular revolt against the General Manager and acting coach, and still only around 400 season ticket holders declined to renew, while the $50 deposit waiting list grew to around 8000 or so (afaik). No discussion of the franchise can ignore the supporters, which is largely the reason we exist at all in the popular consciousness of US soccer. 4th smallest market in MLS and a short jump to much a larger market, were it not for the supporters the Timbers would still be in USL. Every game since joining MLS in 2011 has been sold out and there is a wonderful match-day atmosphere which is the closest I've felt in the US to the air of a Argentinian or German matchday. Our supporters group, the Timbers Army, is probably the most prominent supporters group in MLS relative to the club. **Please note** I'm not starting an argument about ""best SG"" or ""most important SG"", so please don't start a thread of bickering. I'm merely pointing out that the team has basically had no success other than attracting a large, very active, and very devoted fan base and supporters group. We were on TV last year a lot because of the TA and while our dismal season last year means that we'll be on less this time the TA is still our draw for national broadcast. When you're there, they make the games fun, they make the stadium positively ring with song, and for a lot of last year being with them was about the only consolation of watching the Timbers. There is one competition in which I am sure we will be in the finals or thereabouts of and that is for the Tifo of The Year. Look for it to be brightly colored, warm, and probably thematically full of hope and yearning. As this is awarded by internet vote, if the popular preference remains for a more nü-metal color palette and font, look for us to remain bridesmaids to the brides of our neighbors to the near north in that competition. We have fun, we're welcoming, we have some fine t-shirts and hoodies, we're not into exclusivity, and we're not assholes.

We have rivalries with Seattle and Vancouver. In Cascadia we like each other enough that the supporters made a cup of their own a few years ago for the teams to contest, the Cascadia Cup, and we dislike each other enough that the atmosphere at those games is fairly crackling, particularly Portland-Seattle.For those curious, yes it's heated, yes it's real, no you will not get beaten up for wearing Timbers gear in Seattle and vice versa, yes it's very very fun.

For those who haven't been there our stadium Jeld-Wen is from the 1920's and a bit on the small side, which makes it feel intimate, and is right in the middle of the city on the train-line, which means getting there and away is fun. The downside of the location is that in all likelihood it can't be expanded from its current 20480, which is a pity as the Timbers could quite easily fill a 30K-ish stadium. The beer selection is good, the seats aren't bad but the benches are better, and even on a cold rainy night there's very very few places I'd rather be.

Our owner Merritt Paulson continues to Twitter away like a fan, at once passionate, provocative, infuriating, encouraging, and a mixture of all four, and then delete his tweets almost immediately afterwards. He loves the team and the supporters, we by and large feel likewise, and despite the turmoil with the General Manager which lead to some serious sniping back and forth, all seems happy and optimistic.

##Expectations

**Not the basement**: A 4th/5th finish seems possible. However, RSL aside, no one looks any weaker than they did last season and both Dallas and Colorado look significantly stronger, so this might be difficult. Ever the optimist, I'm going to start saving up now for tickets to the game just in case.

**Road games**: they should not have the air of a man being marched out back to a firing squad. The -25 GD of last year needs to be left in the dustbin of history. Will we post a winning road record? Probably not, but I expect it to be better.

**Better fitness**: last years Timbers often simply stopped playing in the final 20 minutes, meaning winnable draws stayed draws, close losses stayed losses, and not-close losses turned into blowouts. 

**The (XBox) Cascadia Cup™ (brought to you by Starbucks Mocha Caramel Frappuchino)**: it's probably not in the cards for us this year as the unbalanced schedule is against us this year and both Vancouver and Seattle look quite strong. Neutral fans: if you want to tune in for some Timbers games, these are probably the ones, particularly the Seattle games both home and away.

------------------------------------------------------------------  

*First Half*

**1'** Portland gets an early start and take a shot on goal. Gspurning is there to make the diving save.

**9'** Portland manufactures a nice attack but the cross is just out of the reach of the attacking player. 

**13'** [](/SEA) [](/goal) Zakuani takes a ball from Zemanski, breezes down the left side and plays a ball in for Eddie Johnson who finishes in the back of the net. **Seattle 1 - Portland 0**

**16'** [](/POR) [](/yellow) Baptiste pulls Eddie Johnson down right outside the box. Could have easily been a red. 

**20'** Johnson's stepovers finally work as he gets free and takes a shot but Ricketts makes the save.

**21'** [](/POR) [](/injury) Ochoa goes in for the ball but Ricketts comes out and gets kicked in the knee. He will stay in the game.

**25'** Its getting chippy. Lot of players down in the box. No penalty for a risky challenge.

**25'** [](/SEA) [](/injury) Traore down in the group of players down in the box. Leg injury. 

**33'** An *insert adjective* dive from Nagbe puts the Timbers in a favorable position just outside the box. 

**37'** Gspurning catches a ball in the box and is fouled by Johnson, shortly after Johnson gives a slight kick to Gspurnings head. Probably unintentional.

**43'** [](/SEA) [](/yellow) Alonso pulls down Valeri and gets a yellow.

**49'** The ensuing free kick goes off the top of the crossbar for a goal kick. 

**50'** [](/POR) [](/yellow) Alonso is tackled by Johnson and Johnson gets a yellow card.

**87'** [](/SEA) [](/injury) EJ down in pain, pointing at calf. 

**89'** Portland gets on a break but Johnson's shot ends up on top of the net after a deflection. 

**90'** [](/POR) [](/goal) Rodney Wallace heads in a nice early cross to tie the game up. **Seattle 1 - Portland 1**

EDIT #2: Ok guys, thanks for keeping me company for the last few hours - it's been real. Please make sure to check out all our coverage of the Cup on http://www.mlssoccer.com/ -- we're really blowing it out over the next few days.

I'll try to make it back here some time in December for another Q&amp;A session. In the meantime you can always holler at me on Twitter: @MLS_Analyst, or just trash-talk me in the comments section of one of my columns.

She didn't want to go and my kids aren't super interested in watching games yet even though they know I like watching every game.  I offered to take my son even though I knew he wouldn't be able stay interested in the whole game.  She conceded, SWEET! We're going to his first game.  Upper bowl tickets were listed as $15 but I was going to have to buy them at the stadium.  We get in line about 15 minutes before kickoff and there are about 30 people ahead of us.  I figured we were going to miss the first 10 minutes of the game.  My son was already pretty tired from the long walk to the stadium too.   I'm wearing my Sounders jersey and hat, my son has a Sounders scarf on.    


After standing in a line for about 5 minutes a woman walks up to me and says  ""Execuse me, is it just you and your son together?""  I said yes.   ""Well come with me, I have two free tickets for you.  I have season tickets and my daughters didn't want to come tonight.  I wanted to give them to someone who had their kid with them.  They are good seats too,  in the 9th row"" 


I about crapped my pants, my jaw was on the floor, I felt like I had won the Price is Right.


We get to the seats at about the 35 yard line, 9th row, holy crap they were good seats.  As the team walks on to the field, she said to my son, ""Come here, see that guy right there waving to you, he's my friend.""  I was like ""uhhhhhh, that's Levesque, how do you know him?  She said, ""Roger coaches my daughter's team.""


The game was amazing, my son had the time of his life.  The atmosphere was amazing, he loved the singing, chanting, and clapping, but especially the FIREWORKS and screaming when we scored.  FOUR TIMES, btw, lol.


So Marlee, Sounders, and the fans, thank you for making such a huge impact on my son's life and helping instill in him the great love for soccer that we all have.    


After the game my son asked me when are we going to go back again.


TL:DR:   Took my son to his first game.  Got free tickets from a random Season Ticket holder while waiting to buy nosebleeds tickets.  Amazing seats.  Levesque waved to my son before the game.

That doesn't change the fact that hating on a team or their fans is not welcome here.

/r/MLS is a great subreddit. A big part of that has long been that you (generally) don't have to worry about being mocked or downvoted simply for supporting the ""wrong"" team. In the earlier days this was basically the result of knowing everyone (or at least recognizing screen names) in a small subreddit and appreciating that we all love the same sport in a growing league.

This subreddit isn't as small as it once was, but that doesn't change the fact that everyone is here because they have some sort of interest in this league and seeing it grow and improve. The fans will be a driving force in the growth of this league, and every fan helps. Constant jokes/barbs/taunts/insults about Chivas/Toronto/New England/whoever alienates those fans, and, whether you like it or not, we need every fan we can get.

So please, stop. If the only thing that you are clever enough to come up with is some tired joke about someone else's team, maybe you should read more. This place is great because, ultimately, we all have the same goal. Stop being a dick.

**Colors**: Burgundy and Blue

**Stadium**: Dick’s Sporting Goods Park

**Overview**:     It seems like every single Rapids fan discussion starts and ends with 2010 so let me just get that out of the way. 2010 was the Colorado Rapids’ “glory year”. They (and we) won the MLS Cup. With that said, a lot of the rest gets lost to mythos. The Rapids that year were under the direction of Gary Smith, a wily Englishman who favored a style of football that emphasized physicality and hard work. Another way of putting it is, we were basically the Stoke City of the MLS. Teams hated us, we were tough to watch, but we really knew how to grind results. That, however, could not last forever and brings us to last year. The FO did not want to play that style of soccer and saw an opening with Gary Smith’s renewal talks to move on. This brought about a lot of fan hatred and celebration. (If how I’m writing this doesn’t make it obvious, I’m on the celebration side) They then brought in Oscar Pareja who favors a possession-style 4-3-3 and has a slightly smaller personality than Gary Smith. (This does not make him less of a badass though, he once played soccer at Pablo Escobar’s home) With this came some real changes, we brought in some players to fit our new system in Martin Rivero an Argentine No. 10 type, Jaime Castrillon Colombian box-to-box, and Luis Zapata a Colombian left back. The core of the team remained the same from the Gary Smith days though and at times it was very clear there were players who could not fit this new system. The Rapids struggled from pretty much day one, showing at times they were totally capable of keeping the ball and putting together some really nice attacking displays, but then about twice as often showing how vulnerable they were at the back and that if things didn’t go their way they were going to revert to their old ways of kick and run. It was at times tough to watch, but you could sense the building of something if we were willing to wait. They went on for a record of 11-19-4 (the most games lost in our history, but to keep in perspective, an 11 win team went to the playoffs) and missed the playoffs by two spots and 6 points. Many of those wins were multiple goal wins and many were multiple goal losses, such was the live by the sword, die by the sword style were playing. Then, the offseason came and things got very interesting.

**Offseason/Midseason Departures**:
Before I go over each one, it is important to note all of the guys I am about to list were in some ways fan favorites and part of the 2010 teams. You will see them receive hero status from a lot of Rapids fans, perhaps not even rightly so.

**Kosuke Kimura** : First casualty from the cup-winning squad. Japanese Right Back who liked to get involved in the attack, could be very weak defensively. Without the cover of defensive wingers in the 4-3-3, he looked very poor all season and got moved. Fans were pissed

**Luis Zapata**: Same problem, different country. Left back out of Colombia. Good in the attack, exposed in defense. Was not a part of 2010 squad, fans were Ok with this one.

**Conor Casey**: Probably one of the Top Ten Names to ever play for Colorado Rapids Soccer Club. To some Rapids fans, he’s Wayne Rooney. Realistically, he was very good in 2010, scores a lot of workman-type goals, is big, holds up the ball well, but had been injured for much of 2012 and was our highest paid player. Fans understood he might have been overpaid, but were still kind of pissed.

**Omar Cummings**: Jamaican Forward. Great personality. Loved by fans. Had been total crap for both 2011 and 2012 and made a lot of money. Fans still reeling over this one.

**Jeff Larentowicz**: The American Anchor. Red Hair. Good with distribution and free kicks. The prototypical central defensive midfielder. Had a rough go in 2012, but might have been the single most important piece in the 2010 cup. He was Gary’s guy, don’t think he ever bought the system, so he’s gone.

*Non starters to leave: Joseph Nane, Hunter Freeman

**Arrivals**: 

**Edson Buddle**: Former L.A. Galaxy forward. One of the top forwards of this MLS era. Some would say ever. Spent some time in Germany. Strong, hold up target guy. Scores a lot with his head.

**Deshorn Brown**: Draft pick. Center forward, could play wing. Fast, tall, raw. Could see solid minutes with a lot of turnaround at the position.

**Kevin Harbottle**: Midfielder out of Chile. Comfortable in the 4-3-3. Will probably start as no. 10 with Martin Rivero out for the beginning of the season.

**Nick Labrocca**: One time MLS All-star from Chivas USA. Good 2-way midfielder, could do well in the 4-3-3. Has not had great form the past couple of years, but Chivas have been awful.

**Dillon Serna**: Academy prospect, signed. Heir to the No. 10 position when Martin Rivero inevitably leaves us for bigger things.

**Dillon Powers**: Draft Pick. Jeff Larentowicz Jr.

**Diego Calderon**: Center Back from Ecuador. Fringe National team player. Looked really solid in the preseason so far. Good with playing it out of the back.

**Atiba Harris**: Kind of Journeyman from Pereja’s old home FC Dallas. Expect him to play in the front 3. Nice possession skills. Can go at a man one-on-one

**Kory Kindle**: Draft pick. Converted left back from midfielder. Great speed. Good asset in the attack. Will need to work out fundamentals of defending.

**Nathan Sturgis**: Re-entry draft pick. Total journeyman. Will back up the defensive midfield and centerback position.

**Predicted Full Health Line Up: 4-3-3**


Atiba Harris-----Edson Buddle-----Tony Cascio

                      
------------------Martin Rivero-----------------

Pablo Mastroeni----------------------Hendry Thomas


Anthony Wallace------Drew Moor----Diego Calderon-------Marvell Wynne




**To Watch**: Rivero the Number 10, Hendry Thomas- defensive midfielder with international and premiere league experience, enforcer type, and Tony Cascio-young winger, expect to have a breakout season.


**Stadium/Fan Culture**: I sadly go to school away from my team at the moment in Sounders territory. I fell in love with them from afar as the child of Coloradans in Omaha, Nebraska as well. The stadium’s capacity is about 18,000 and they average in the 14-15,000 zone. It is in Commerce City, which probably isn’t totally ideal, but allows them to have a whole complex for their youth teams on site. It’s beautiful. I’ll let someone else speak to the rest of this though, as I’ve only been to 5 or so games there.

**Outlook**: With so much changed, this is a tough section. As one can probably see, I am optimistic. I think Oscar Pareja really wants to play “the right way”. I believe in that message. The question will be do we have the players for that? I think we are a hell of a lot closer than last year. The cup run was a great time for Rapids fans, but it’s time to let go. That era is gone. I expect we’ll be fringe playoff contenders and play strikingly better towards the end of the season. Since the person who came up with this idea is a new Rapids fan, I’m going to address them directly, you’ve made a great choice. It is an exciting time to be a Rapids fan. They want to be the team that every team looks at and says “I want to play like that”. They’re going to do really frustrating things (like all teams do), but at the end of the day I think we will be very proud of the way that we play and the culture we created. Welcome to the Burgundy!

Edit:

*Main Rivals*: Real Salt Lake. This runs pretty deep. I saw a kid on campus wearing an RSL jersey and trash-talked him, he was just wearing it because he likes jerseys. The matches are called the Rocky Mountain Cup which is a fan-created trophy and is administered by a 10-person fan committee. RSL leads 6-2. The players and offices seem to take it very seriously and actually hate each other. In 2006, when Colorado last won it, Pablo Mastroeni stuffed his shorts with his jersey and showed those terrible Utahans what was up (flipped them off). RSL's owner came onto the field to get at him about it. It was awesome. Should be a great year for the RMC. It'll be three legs this year with the amount of wins being the deciding factor followed by aggregate goals, then away goals, then the previous year's winner.

* First is [Seattle](http://i.imgur.com/QRTnR71.png) I based the design off this [NASL jersey](http://nasljerseys.com/images/Sounders/Sounders%2082-83%20Road%20Jersey%20Mark%20Peterson_small.jpg)
Its very simple because the Sounders didnt have a really iconic NASL jersey to get inspiration from.

* Second we have the [Vancouver Whitecaps](http://i.imgur.com/c6ELkMF.png) Which is based of this [NASL jersey](http://nasljerseys.com/images/Whitecaps/Whitecaps%2079%20Road%20Jersey%20Roger%20Kenyon_small.JPG) I like this one a lot. [Vancouver with sponsor](http://i.imgur.com/hX830cu.png)


* Third we have the [Portland Timbers](http://i.imgur.com/C0GbFUJ.png)
Which is based off this [NASL jersery](http://nasljerseys.com/images/Timbers/Timbers%2081%20Road%20Dale%20Mitchell_small.jpg) with a little yellow instead of white. This one is my homeristic favorite. [Portland with sponsor](http://i.imgur.com/Ls7ABaB.png)

**English Premier League**

**Clint Dempsey** - Fulham

Clint will either be starting his 7th season with Fulham, or trying to force a move to a Champions League Club.  Last year Clint became the most prolific American in the history of the Premier League, scoring 17 goals, along with 3 more Europa League goals and 3 in the FA Cup.  If he remains at Fulham he will probably be starting every week and playing deep into every match.  If he does force a move to Liverpool or another big club he'll still play but he'll probably be a second or third choice and will have to compete for a starting spot.

Dempsey has been a national team player since 2004 and has been indespensible in all of our recent tournaments.  In 2012 he has scored 4 goals in 4 matches.

**Brad Friedel** - Tottenham Hotspur

Friedel has been a journeyman in the Premier League for several years.  Last year was his first year at Tottenham and he was one of the best goalkeepers in the league.  He's played in all 38 league matches for his club for eight years running.  Barring an injury you can expect that he will start for Spurs all year again.

As well as playing in England, Spurs will competing in Europa League again this year.  Last year Friedel did not play in European matches.

Friedel retired from the USMNT in 2005.

**Brad Guzan** - Aston Villa

Last year Guzan only played 7 matches for Aston Villa.  It's unclear if he will be the starting keeper or if he will start on the bench.  He hasn't secured a regular starting job since coming to the Premier league in 2008.

He is generally considered the USA #3 goal keeper, but he hasn't seen very much playing time in the Klinnsman era, behind Tim Howard and Nick Rimando.  He was on the bench in the recent World Cup Qualifiers against Guatemala and Antigua, and I expect that he'll be there on the next leg against Jamaica too.  

**Tim Howard** - Everton

Howard has been the Everton #1 since 2006.  He should start every match this season, barring injury.

Howard is also the USA #1 and has been since 2007.  Most recently he ""covered himself in glory"" with two big saves to beat Mexico in Mexico on 8/15/12.  He will continue to start for the USA throughout the 2014 World Cup cycle.

**Eric Lichaj** - Aston Villa

Lichaj has played well for Aston Villa and on loan for Leeds United.  He hasn't been part of Aston Villa's best XI in the past, and if he isn't this year it's probable that he'll go on loan again this year.

Lichaj played for the National team in the last Gold Cup, but hasn't been called up in over a year now.  Unless he can secure a starting spot and get some stability, don't expect to see him in Red White and Blue.

**Geoff Cameron** - Stoke

Geoff just finalized the move to Stoke.  It is unknown to what capacity he will be used.

Cameron hasn't seen a lot of national team time, but seems to have impressed Klinnsman recently.  He should be involved in the next couple WCQ matches, at least, and could be a possible long term replacement for some of our aging defenders.

**Villyan Bijev** - Liverpool

Bijev is an American Youth prospect who has most recently played for the U-20 team earlier this year.  He spent last year mostly on loan to Dusseldorf.  He'll probably go on loan again this year or play for the reserve team.

-------


**German Bundasliga**

**Steve Cherundelo** - Hannover 96

Steve has been with Hannover since 1999 and helped them gain promotion from 2. Bundasliga.  He's been captain since 2010.  He should start most of their matches and will probably retire a Hannoverian.  Hannover will be competing in Europa League this year.

Cherundelo is a regular starter for the National Team and should be one through the 2014 World Cup cycle.

**Joseph Gyau** - Hoffenheim

Gyau was just called up from Hoffenheim II to the senior team.  It is yet to be seen if he starts or is used as a reserve.

Gyau was a member of the U-23 team in their olympic qualification campaign.

**Jared Jeffrey** - Mainz

Jeffery sees regular playing time at Mainz where he has been since 2010.  

Jeffery has been a part of every US junior level team, most recently playing in our U-23 olympic qualifying tournament.

**Fabian Johnson** - Hoffenheim

Last year was Johnson's first at Hoffenheim.  He played in 29 games and should feature again this year.

Johnson is one of Jurgen's ""Cold-War Kids.""  He's been a regular call up this year and should continue to be used on the National Team for the foreseeable future.

**Jermaine Jones** - Schalke 04

Jones has had a bumpy path in Schalke, but pretty much cemented his starting spot last year.  If he can keep his head and play to his full potential he should stay there and contend for the Bundasliga title, as well as playing in Champions League group stages.  Although he could start something at anytime with an opponent or teammate that may take him out of the starting lineup, or even out of the club altogether.  

Despite his age and his unruliness, Klinnsman has shone total dedication to Jones.  He is the face of the Cold-War Kids.  Expect to see him play for USA through 2014.  

**Danny Williams** - Hoffenheim

Williams played 21 matches last year for Hoffenheim.  He should feature prominently again this year.

Williams in another Cold-War Kid and is a regular call up.  He was a part of the WCQ matches this year and the friendly in Mexico.

**David Yelldell** - Bayer Leverkusen

Yelldell is a backup goal keeper.  He played last year in Leverkusen's DFB Pokel matches, but didn't play in the Bundasliga.  We may see him play in some of their Europa League Matches.

Yelldell has 1 cap for USA in a Friendly in 2011.  Unless he falls into a starting roll for Leverkusen and becomes a wunderkind, don't expect him to factor into USA's plans.

**Timmy Chandler** - Nernburg

Chandler seems to have solidified his starting spot for Nernburg, where he has bee since 2010.  

Is he American?  Is he German?  We don't really know and neither does he.  He has played for Klinnsman in several friendlies, but has balked at cap-locking himself to USA by pulling out of the World Cup Qualifiers.  He may be holding out for a Germany call up.  We may or may not see him play for USA in the future, although if he does come around he'll probably be our #1 choice at right back.

**Italian Serie A**

**Michael Bradley** - Roma

Bradley was just the subject of a big money move to Roma.  I don't expect anything less than a starting roll for nearly every game.  Last year he solidified himself as a top midfielder in Italy and should continue to stand out.

Bradley has featured in every competitive match and most friendlies since Klinnsman became head coach.  He will be a vital part of team USA for many years to come.

-------


**Dutch Eredivisie**

**Jozy Altidore** - AZ Alkmaar

Last year was Jozy's first at Alkmaar, and the most productive of his career.  He scored 15 league goals, and 4 more in Europa.  He should feature prominantly for AZ again this year both in Eredivisie and Europa.  He has already scored for AZ, they started their season last week.

Despite his break out season in the Netherlands, Jozy actually lost his starting striker role on the USMNT to Hercules Gomez.  He should still be part of every USA squad for many years to come, but expect to see him either as a sub or as a second striker in the near future.

--------


**Austrian Bundasliga** 

**Terrence Boyd** - Rapid Wien

Boyd has already been a factor at Rapid after only 4 matches (Austria starts a little early).  He's already scored two goals in first season in a top flight.

Considering his lack of experience, Klinnsman has put a remarkable amount of trust in this kid.  He already seems to be a MNT staple and has played in 5 senior team matches before his 22nd birthday.  He was also on the U-23 team in their Olympic qualies.

-------

There are more Americans playing in Europe in the top flights of the Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Israeli, Finish, Bosnian, Portuguese, Irish, and Belgian leagues.  As well as many Americans in the lower English and German leagues.  These are just some of the most prominent to get your European season started.

##Supporters: *A Cinderella Story*

Sam Pierron is a name known among many supporters who have been around MLS for a while. Pierron was a student at the nearby University of Kansas when Kansas City was awarded a franchise and spearheaded the creation of the ""Mystics"" a group dedicated to support the Wizards. A couple years later Pierron, with the help of other supporters around the league, raised $3,000 to fund a trophy that would award the team with the best regular season record. That trophy, the Supporters Shield, got hand delivered by Pierron (who was a senior at KU at the time) to Los Angeles in [1999](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/magazine/archives/news/story?page=magazine-19990517-article4).

Through the years the Mystics, while sparse in numbers, became a mix of cultures and races which included Argentinian supporters and at one point a Brazilian samba band. In 2001 the group met with the team GM to finally set aside a section for the supporters, which would become the group known as the Cauldron. In the next few years the group grew from ~50 per game to just under 200. In 2006, when the team was sold by the Hunts to a local group, the Cauldron turned into a section completely recognized by the front office as a supporters section. This allowed the group to grow even more and by the time they moved into Community America Ballpark their numbers grew into the hundreds, eventually filling the 600+ seats set aside in the converted baseball park. The move into (Livestrong) Sporting Park in 2011 was highlighted by a revolutionary purpose built supporters section. That year the group grew to fill out the 2,000+ seat section which now has a season ticket waiting list. 

Today the Cauldron stays true to it's name, being a large family of many smaller groups including regional support groups from nearby cities. The popularity of the Cauldron has grown on to the other side of the stadium, sparking supporters to make their own groups in the GA section to the south.

##2012: A Brief Overview

* Points: 63 (1st in Eastern, 2nd overall)

* Goals: 42

* Goals Against: 27

* Record: 18-7-9

Sporting KC had about as good of a start to 2012 that you could ask for, rattling off seven straight wins and outscoring opponents 12-2. SKC's hot start was led by their stellar defense, who had a stretch of 245 minutes without giving up a shot on goal during the streak. Eventually Sporting fell back to Earth and lost 3 straight before rebounding by going 2-0-2 in their next four. Issues on the offense became apparent as the team struggled to take care of chances consistently. After losing two out of 3 in a matter of ten days, Sporting would go on a 7-0-5 run over two and a half months to clinch first in the conference. Unfortunately their scoring issues turned disastrous as they fell early to Houston in the first round of the playoffs and where never able to recover. 

The 2012 season did not go without triumph though, as Sporting KC reached and won the US Open Cup final for the first time since 2004. Sporting KC's defense played a large part as they held opposition to 3 goals in 5 games, posting 3 shut outs. The final came against three time defending champions Seattle where the champion was decided in penalty kicks. The US Open Cup win meant a berth in CONCACAF's Champions League, the first for Kansas City since CONCACAF switched formats (last appearance was the CONCACAF Champion's Cup in 2005).

**Predicted Lineup**

---Bobby Convey----Claudio Bieler----Graham Zusi---

---Paulo Nagamura----Benny Feilhaber----Oriol Rosell---

Seth Sinovic----Matt Besler----Aurelien Collin----Chance Meyers

------------------Jimmy Nielsen--------------------


**Players to Watch**

* Claudio Bieler- Brought in to boost Sporting KC's offense, Bieler became Sporting KC's sole Designated Player for 2013. The 28 year old was a part of LDU Quito's 2008 Copa Libertadores championship and 2008 FIFA Club World Cup runner-up. Was the Ecuadorian Serie A's leading goal scorer in 2009. Was rumored to be in talks with Liga MX's Toluca before signing with Sporting KC. 

* Benny Feilhaber- Will be an immediate starter in the SKC lineup from day one and looks to help stabilize midfield. Has seen time with the US national team and has seen time in the Bundesliga and EPL.

* Oriol ""Uri"" Rosell- 20 year old midfielder who played in Barcelona's youth system since 2006 and made six appearances for Barcelona's B squad. Was signed with Sporting KC in early 2012 and while he didn't get many minutes, had a solid outing against Houston in the second leg of the playoff quarterfinals. Scored his first goal for SKC against Toronto. 

**Storylines**

* Can Sporting KC solve their scoring woes?- While creating chances was far from an issue, getting the ball in the back of the net was a much bigger problem. The additions of Claudio Bieler and Benny Feilhaber and a healthy Convey may be the solution. 

* How much will SKC miss Espinoza and Kamara?- Espinoza's work rate on both ends of the field and Kamara's offensive power will be missing this season. SKC's defense last year started with the midfield and losing someone like Espinoza will put the back line under more pressure. While Kamara's presence on the field will be missed, his finishing could be inconsistent, so we'll see how big of a hole he leaves. Kamara's ball movement and heart will be a big loss for the first part of the season (or for longer if Norwich uses their option). 

* Can the new additions click?- Sporting KC's starting midfield will look almost entirely different than last year with the addition of Feilhaber and the emergence of Rosell. These additions could mean a more possession based game than last year as SKC won't be playing with three defensive minded midfielders anymore. 

* CONCACAF play- Kansas City's first appearance in CONCACAF play since 2005 should be entertaining as the ownership has made it a big priority to do well in. SKC's depth will be tested with the increase in games, so young talent like Soony Saad and Peterson Joseph will be in the spotlight. 

**Games to Watch**

* Chicago Fire (3/16, NBC Sports)- Each of the 3 match ups last year were extremely heated and this year's home opener looks to be no different

* @ Los Angeles Galaxy (4/20, NBC Sports)- The only regular season game between the 2012 MLS Cup Champions and Supporter's Shield runner-up

* Seattle Sounders (5/8)- Sounders return to Sporting Park for the first time since they lost to SKC in the USOC final

* Every other Houston and Chicago game. Each will be heated and intense, that's pretty much a guarantee. ",,False,self,t5_2rbnb,1371972200.0,,sporting-kansas-city,True,t3_19av2e,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/19av2e/sporting_kansas_city_countdown_to_kickoff/,

I'm in awe when I see MLS matches now. The games are exciting, the crowd is always chanting, the players are playing their hearts out (except several foreign stars that still don't seem to take it seriously).

Is the year of the MLS, I am sure of that. There's no going back, from now on the MLS will grow exponentially. With all the corruption going on with European (and worldwide) soccer, MLS shimmers a light of hope in a new honest league. 

I'm a new and proud to be a Sounders fan (I'm also liking the Quakes a lot). Now I talk about MLS with everyone, they mention European soccer, I change the subject to MLS.

There were a bunch of excuses flying around, such as the fact that the weather was bad, mid-week games, holidays, etc. However, the Montreal Impact administration was not looking for excuses. They pulled an impressive move and very straightforwardly asked the 12th player, the fans, what *they were doing wrong.* (Link can be found [here](http://www.impactmontreal.com/en/news/2012/06/games-stade-saputo-good-show-display).)

Seeing this, I was skeptical. It's easy to point fingers, collect data and look like you're reaching out to your fanbase. What interested me was if they were going to do anything about it.

They did. In a masterful stroke of a press conference that made me feel prouder of my favorite MLS club than I've ever been.

It started with the press conference introducing Nesta. I don't want to overshadow the importance of Nesta's arrival to the organization, but the real mastery occurred immediately after he left the stage. Joey Saputo, Impact's owner and Richard Legendre, a VP, took the stage and announced that they were making *radical changes to the pricing structure*.

Essentially, they mentioned how impressed they were with people's response. Whether it be on facebook, on the Impact's website or by email, people took their time to think and to give constructive criticism. The main point that kept coming back was the pricing of the tickets and how it was just too high.

The exact details aren't yet available on their website, but they were hinting at deals for 18-35 year olds, deals for small families, 30$ ticket with food and drink included, a bring-a-friend deal, with the cheapest tickets going for 18$.

To top it all off, it's effective immediately in time for the Columbus game on Sunday.

I am so immensely proud.

If you have an attitude change, you can stay, but we both know that isn't going to happen.  You are the third highest paid player in the league and you don't earn it.

Well, that is true. But this is the MLS when have we cared what FIFA said? We started out our league entirely different from FIFA standards. Hell, we do not have promotion or relegation like most leagues (moot point do not need to go into that now or again, pick this issue back up in 10 years) and of course our schedule is suited to our climate while the rest of the world plays fall to spring, us being spring to late fall, early winter.

So should the USSF impose goal line technology? Would it benefit the league, gather more eyes to MLS? Make them oo and ahh at the league?

I remember celebrating when we hit 100 subscribers, then 500, then 1,000, then 2,000 and now we've hit 3,000 MLS fans. This subreddit has surpassed everything I hoped it would be. We have grown slowly but steadily (excluding the 2 days around the Alexi Lalas AMA where we gained over 150 people) and the community has morphed and evolved to meet the needs and interests of the contributing members.

We get so many great contributions of news and opinion articles (and even a few AMA's!) from around the league and North American soccer. We get the opportunity to ask questions and teach newcomers to MLS about our league (and it is OUR league). I am constantly learning new things about players and league history, it's fantastic.

I think the most incredible thing here at /r/mls isn't the growth or the articles -- it's the fact that we are all able to discuss our teams that we are so passionate about in a civilized manner. I actually prefer to come here to talk about MLS over sites like BigSoccer and even my own supporters group's website because there simply aren't as many jerks around here.

**Brief Summary of 2012 Season**

---------------------------------------------------------

**Final Result:** Eastern Conference Champions, MLS Cup Runners-up

**Record**: 14W - 11T - 9L -- Finished 5th in Eastern conference

The Dynamo began the 2012 regular season with an extended seven-game road trip. As a team that hasn't been known for a ton of success away from Houston, the Dynamo fared better than expected, picking up two wins and two draws. With eight points in the books, the Dynamo eagerly came home to their brand new BBVA Compass Stadium. The 22,000 seat downtown venue immediately produced results, as did their switch in formation from their traditional 4-4-2 to a 4-3-3. The Dynamo went on to earn 32 points in their next 16 games, 26 of which came from their 11 games at home over that span. The last third of the season saw less consistency from the boys in orange, as they dropped from first to fifth in the East, barely hanging on to a wild-card spot that wasn't secured until the penultimate game of the regular season. 

The Dynamo regained their mojo in the playoffs, winning the play-in at Chicago, besting DC United and Sporting KC in the the Eastern Conference Semifinals and Finals, respectively, before falling short to the LA Galaxy in the MLS Cup Final for the second year running. That result earned the Dynamo a spot in the 2013-14 CONCACAF Champions League; the club also progressed out of the group stage and into the Quarterfinals of the 2012-13 CCL in 2012.

**Notable Players Gone:**

---------------------------------------------------------

**Andre Hainault**

RB and Canadian national team member that was in the Starting XI more often than not, but a dip in performance and the rise in form of Kofi Sarkodie presumably led to our only ginger looking for greener grass in the SPL with Ross County.

**Macoumba Mandji**

The Senegalese left winger appeared in 29 matches last season for the Dynamo. Kandji was a speedy player that effectively attacked and stretched defenses with his speed and ball control, but his lack of finishing marred an otherwise good year for the club, and he ultimately declined a contract extension in favor of signing with the Greek second-division side, Kalloni F.C.

**Colin Clark**

A versitile midfielder for the Dynamo, Colin played in 43 matches over three seasons with the Dynamo, but found himself further down the depth chart later in the year with the 2012 signings of Boniek Garcia and Ricardo Clark. Colin Clark's contract expired at the end of the 2012 season, and he was picked up by the LA Galaxy in the Re-Entry Draft.


---------------------------------------------------------

**Notable Players Signed/drafted:**

---------------------------------------------------------

**Omar Cummings**

Adding some attacking strength as well as increasing the count of Jamaican national players on the roster, the Dynamo traded Colorado Nathan Sturgis and allocation money for forward Omar Cummings. Cummings scored 39 goals in 148 games played for the Rapids, including 14 goals on the way to the Rapids' 2010 MLS Cup Championship season.

**Eric Brunner**

In December, the Dynamo acquired central defender and avid Starcraft player Eric Brunner from the Portland Timbers in exchange for allocation money. Brunner appeared in 45 games for the Timbers over two seasons. He will provide some depth to the CB spot behind Jermaine Taylor and Bobby Boswell.

**Jason Johnson**

Johnson was the 13th overall pick in the 2013 Superdraft, previously playing at Virginia Commonwealth University as well as the Jamaican national and U-23 squads. In 2012, Johnson lead VCU with 13 goals and six assists in 21 appearances, and was named Atlantic 10's Offensive Player of the Year.

**Jimmy Nealis**

Nealis was the 37th overall pick in the Superdraft, and adds some more fullback depth that will definitely be tested amidst the 2013 MLS season and two CONCACAF Champions League campaigns. He was named to the All-Big East second team in 2012, recording six assists in 26 games for Georgetown.


---------------------------------------------------------

**Players To Watch in 2013**

---------------------------------------------------------

**Will Bruin**

Bruin flourished in his sophomore season in Houston, leading the club with 12 goals in the regular season and added four more goals in the 2012 MLS Playoffs. With a couple of new options for speedy strike partners in 2013 and plenty of service expected to come in from veteran Brad Davis and talented international Boniek Garcia, Bruin definitely has an opportunity to increase that total this season.

**Calen Carr**

Carr had an outstanding 2012 season for the Dynamo (and arguably the best and definitely most acrobatic - goal celebrations), which was only marred by the ACL tear suffered just minutes after opening the scoring in the MLS Cup Final. I haven't seen definitive word yet on how long he's going to be out, but the sooner Carr can get healthy, the better for the Dynamo.

**Kofi Sarkodie**

Sarkodie won the starting RB spot from Hainault midway through the 2012 season, and provided a crucial third goal in the first leg of the Eastern Conference Semifinals in Houston. This will be his first season starting as the first-choice RB for Houston, and it will be interesting to see how well he develops into that role for the Dynamo.


---------------------------------------------------------

**2013 Outlook**

---------------------------------------------------------

The entire Starting XI for the 2012 MLS Cup Final have been retained for 2013, and the Dynamo have picked up some good depth in key areas, as well as a couple of speedy strikers to help Bruin up top while Calen Carr is out injured. Also, the Dynamo don't have to deal with the extended road trip that they went through during the beginning of the 2012 season. Houston has every reason to think that they will be in the mix for another MLS Cup Final. 

As for the CONCACAF Champions League, the Dynamo did well to make it out of the 2012 group stage playing mostly reserve players. The home-and-home tie against Santos Laguna will be a tough test for the squad, who will have only played their MLS season opener at BBVA a couple days prior. If they can utilize their home field advantage in the first leg at BBVA, they may just have a shot at shocking the Mexican club.

---------------------------------------------------------

**Matches I'm Looking Forward to in 2013**

---------------------------------------------------------

**Mar. 2 v. DC United** - I can still remember the moment in the 2012 home opener when Brad Davis blasted in a left-footed rocket past Hamid to send the Dynamo faithful into a frenzy. I can still feel the anticipatory buzz of the crowd as we waited in the tunnels, holding on to the U.S. flag as we were waiting for our cue to come out onto the pitch in front of the 22,000 orange-clad spectators. One year later, we're still carrying a home unbeaten streak, and I expect the home opener this year to equal the atmosphere that was created last May.

**May 12 v. Sporting KC** - There have been a lot of close, gritty matches between SKC and Houston, and I suspect that some of the Sporting players will still have a little bit of payback on their minds (the same could be said for DCU, for that matter). 

**October 2013** - The end of the 2013 season will be tough sledding for the boys in orange, finishing the season against Sporting KC, the NY Red Bulls, and then away to DC United. The Dynamo didn't punch their 2012 playoff ticket until there was only one game left in the season, and I'm sure all of the Houston faithful would rather see the matter settled before mid-October.

Location: Chester, PA

Head coach: John Hackworth

Formation: 4-3-3… or who knows?

&gt;---Le Toux------Casey -----McInerney----

&gt;--------------M. Farfan/Torres--------------

&gt;----------©Carroll-----Okugo/Lahoud-----

&gt;--G. Farfan----Parke---Soumaré---Williams

&gt;----------------MacMath-----------------

**Key Players:**

•Connor Casey: The big striker joins the Union from Colorado in an attempt to finally get some height in the Union front line. Hopefully he’ll be dangerous on set pieces and still has some of that aggression that made him such an asset to Colorado for so many years.

•Sébastien Le Toux: He’s back! The Frenchman is a fan favourite who always adds dynamism and running to the attack. Some fans question whether he has enough quality to really make an impact, as his technique / touch sometimes let him down. I imagine he’ll play a heck of a lot of minutes whether it’s up top or out wide

•Whoever plays playmaker: The attack-minded midfielder in the middle of the 4-3-3 is going to be integral to the success of the U this year. Whether Michael Farfan (who can also play on the wing) takes over for Adu (who’s reportedly not registered with the team this year) or Roger Torres who, at 21, is one of the Union’s most tenured players. He had flashes of brilliance in his first few seasons, but looked physically weak and inconsistent. He’s been burning up preseason though, so we’ll see who locks down the spot.

•Amobi Okugo: A Union original defensive midfielder. He played Centerhalf much of last year and excelled. Most think that settling him at CB would waste his dynamism and box-to-box runs, and I agree. I’m hoping he can work with Brian Carroll in midfield and we can let Soumaré and Parke lock down the back

**Homegrown Players:**

•Zac Pfeffer: Midfielder currently out on loan at Hoffenheim. Looks like he may break into a bigger team before he ever really breaks into the Union. He’s been making huge waves out in Germany so… good for him. Maybe he’ll bring the U a big transfer fee.

•Jimmy McLaughlin: Midfielder who’s getting some minutes in preseason, but probably won’t feature too much in our fairly deep team

•Christain Hernandez: No, I spelled it right. This Mexican striker has had a few good performances (notably against Everton IIRC), but again, won’t likely feature too much with the depth up top.

**The Depth Situation:** The U has a lot of “pretty good” players. No real stars, but a lot of solid players. Because of this we’re probably going to see a lot of squad rotation as Hackworth tries to figure out what tools he’s got to work with.

In strikers alone we have Le Toux, Casey, McInerney, super-sub and all around pest Antoine Hoppenot, New target man Aaron Wheeler, home grown Christain Hernandez, and Chandler Hoffman. 

The midfield looks similar with Danny Cruz, Keon Daniel, Michael Lahoud, and Greg Jordan all looking to fight for minutes with the midfielders listed above.

Defense doesn’t look too deep, but squad players Chris Albright and Ray Gaddis look to fight for some minutes, the last two attempting to break into the first team regularly. 

**A Brief History:**
 
The Union is young. Entering our 4th season of existing, The U looks to recreate their form from their 2nd season, in which they made the play-offs for the first time. Having finally divested psychopathic manager Petr Nowak, Assitant-made-Head-Coach John Hackworth looks to his first full season in charge. We’ve got our stadium (beautiful PPL Park in… beautiful Chester), We’ve got our team, and now we’ve got a man at the wheel! We haven’t won anything yet, but give us some time.

There are rumors of some economic tenuousness with the FO. They’re not mega-rich, but a conglomerate of local lawyers and businessmen headed by Nick Sackiewicz who seems to have the best interests of the club at heart. Last year there were some rumblings that the U owed taxes to the city of Chester, but nothing seems to have come of it yet. We’ve lost our two top earners in Adu and Valdes so maybe that helps.

**Philosophy:**

Not quite sure we’ve had time to develop a cohesive philosophy. Hack likes to play attacking soccer with very attacking wingbacks (bombing Sheanon Williams and Winger-turned-defender Gabe Farfan characterize that). There are suggestions that we’ll be playing a 4-3-3 this year, but with a very nebulous “Starting XI” who knows? We’ve got a lot of decent players, but no real stars. The squad is young so there are a lot of players who can force their way into the squad and change the team, but nobody has taken the step up yet, barring maybe Jack McInerney last year.

Jack was a fringey fringe player under Petr Nowak, but became the first choice striker last year once Hack took over by scoring pretty consistantly. He fights for 90 minutes every game and runs and runs. He goes up against defenders twice his size fearlessly, but he’s still young. Many hope he will develop into a really solid player as he’s only 20, but bringing in 4 strikers in the off-season has raised questions about his role. 

**Roster:** [Wikipedia]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Sports_%26_Entertainment,_LLC#Current_roster)

**New Signings:**

•Connor Casey: Already mentioned

•Sébastian Le Toux: Already mentioned

•Aaron Wheeler: A young, 6’4” striker who joins from Finland. Nobody really knows much about him, and he’s yet to feature in preseason

•Jeff Parke: Solid Seattle CB Parke joins the Union to replace ex-captain Carlos Valdés. He’s a solid all-arounder who Philly fans hope will keep up his Seattle form.


•Leo Fernandes: Brazillian born American from Stoney Brook U. Kind of an unknown quantity, but has looked extremely bright in preseason. Unlucky for Leo, fighting for the playmaker spot will be tough with Michael Farfan and Roger Torres ahead of him. I’m pretty sure he hasn’t actually SIGNED for the U yet, but with the way he’s been playing I’m sure he will be



•Don Anding: As draftees go, looks nothing special. Prefers playing as a striker, but likely won’t find much time up there with all the competition. Can play on the left wing and has pace to spare. Scouting reports list his soccer IQ as very low, and his first few preseason performances show it.


**Players leaving:**

•Carlos Valdés: This one hurts. This is the second season we’ve lost our Colombian Captain for peanuts. Last year we lost Faryd Mondragon as we voided his contract allowing him to go home and this year we loan out Valdés to Santa Fé so he can hopefully get the national team coach’s attention before the next World Cup. He was an MLS All Star and a huge part of the Union’s solid defense. Hopefully Parke can replace him.

•Porfiro Lopez: Good riddance to bad rubbish. He was brought in on loan to fix our left-back problem, but young inexperienced out-of-position Gabe Farfan kept him out of the team. 

•Gabriel ‘Gavilan’ Gomez: A bit of a strange one. He surely made a lot of money, but the Panamanian midfielder added a lot of quality and pedigree to the U. He was a pretty good distributor and made some great runs from deep midfield. Great set-piece taker and had good height too. I guess Hackworth didn’t like him, because once he took over, Gavilan saw the bench more often than not.

•Josué Martinez: Whatever. He’s off to New York as part of the Le Toux deal and I don’t know too many people that are that sad about it. Josué looked decent during his limited stints in the team, but nothing terribly exciting. He’s young and Costa Rican. He prefers playing up top, but can play out right. He’s got pace, but he’s a rough diamond for a team that’s got a heck of a lot of strikers.

**Supporter Atmosphere:**

 The Union only have 1 official supporters group, The Son’s of Ben. They’ve developed a bit of a reputation as being rather die-hard (which I imagine most fans say of their supporters groups). They were integral in getting the Union in Philly, attending the 2010 Superdraft before the city actually HAD a team. They’re a good-spirited, good-hearted group who are welcoming to new fans and respectful, if loud, towards visitors. 

They wear sky blue, and gold and protect The River End, a behind-goal section directly adjacent to the Delaware River. They sing a passage from Scooter’s “Maria: I Like it Loud” affectionately referred to as “Doop doop doop” after goals.

**The Freddy Adu Drama:**

Freddy Adu was signed by ex-coach Petr Nowak from their time at DC. Freddy hadn’t been having a great time in Portugal, then Greece, but Ol’ Pete figured he’d sign him up. 

Fans were excited. I was excited. He was supposed to be a dangerous midfielder who could cut up defenses with a final ball or a dribble. What we got was an overpaid, moody player. Fan opinion is still very much split on Freddy as some say he wasn’t given enough play time to show his talent and others say “What talent?” He looked lethargic in his few appearances and didn’t convince that many people. 

As the 2013 season begun Hack said that Adu will not be playing for the Union this year… to some rejoicing and some lamentation. Unfortunately nobody actually BOUGHT Freddy, so he’s still getting paid by the U, but he isn’t registered with the squad and thus, won’t be playing. 

If I can editorialize, I’m glad his $400,000 salary is cut from the team and I’m glad to see him gone. I’m of the opinion that Michael Farfan is the player that Adu was supposed to be for the Union at 1/5 of the price. Dean_Moriarty will come in and tell you how Freddy got cheated, but I’ll leave that to him!

For the stat nerds out there, here's some bonus trivia regarding the awards (and notes for myself for next year).  Some of these are using voting counts out of RES, and since those are ""fuzzed"", take some of the specific numbers with a grain of salt:

* Eric Hassli appears to be our first back-to-back award winner, as he won Goal Of The Year last year for his [golazo against Seattle](http://youtu.be/w8Vfdx7LEh4).  (I can't find the 2010 award winners list, so I can't confirm this to be the case.)
* Matt Doyle was not the only person or team to [win a Reddit double](http://www.mlssoccer.com/blog/post/2012/12/05/armchair-analyst-am-i-about-win-reddit-double) this year. Chris Wondlowski takes Player Of The Year and Best Striker; Graham Zusi takes Best Midfielder and Most Improved Player; and the San Jose Earthquakes takes Most Exciting MLS Team To Watch and Most Improved Team.
* Closest award margin: Both ""Best Tifo or Fan Display"" and ""Best Team Subreddit"" were determined by a razor-thin two point spread.
* Largest award margin: No real surprise, it came for a Worst category - Piotr Nowak ran away with Worst Coach Of The Year, posting a 145 point spread between himself and the first runner up (Hans Backe), who received 0 points in voting.
* Highest score for a nominee: Again, Nowak domination - his 145 points was the highest total score for any one nominee in the running.
* Lowest score for a nominee: Perhaps it was fatigue from so many nominations for the team, but r/SJEarthquakes got downvoted all the way to -31 points in the Best Team Subreddit category.
* Most upvoted category: Villain of the Year (313 upvotes across all nominees)
* Most downvoted category: Most Exciting MLS Team To Watch (178 downvotes across all categories)
* Least contentious category: Villain Of The Year (a net +206 score across all nominees)
* Most contentious category: It's quite impressive that Best Team Subreddit came out to a net -25 score.  When it comes to team subreddits, you guys are out for blood.
* Most popular category: Villain Of The Year (420 total votes)
* Least popular category: Best r/MLS Contributor (181 total votes)
* Total (fuzzed) votes: 6411 upvotes, 3190 downvotes, for a total of **9,714 individual votes**.

(Recognizing that people can still go in and try and tinker with the scores on the voting thread, I have a PDF snapshot from when I did the final tabulations.)",,False,self,t5_2rbnb,1354988012.0,,new-york-red-bulls,True,t3_14i5nu,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/14i5nu/announcing_the_2012_rmls_award_winners/,moderator

I'm part of a new supporters group in San Jose and we wanted to give out free tickets in order to introduce people to our group. This had me thinking that there are  most likely people in /r/MLS that may have tickets that they don't need or other supporters groups that would like to offer free tickets. 

 

With that said, going forward I'm going to make a thread every week (Mondays) where people can offer others free tickets. Also,  if someone has an easy way to help me format this it'll be helpful.

**Overview:**

Its hard to understate the impact that playing the second leg of the CONCACAF Champions League final at home in the RioT and losing it had on the psyche of RSL nation. The first half extra time goal by Suazo, the series of near misses by Espindola and Olave, the frantic search for the equalizer that would net us a draw and take us through to the Club World Cup, the deep and persistent agony, even embarassment, we all felt when we couldn't find the net in front of the entirety of CONCACAF for 90 plus minutes, and the ache of watching a rare golden opportunity to win a regional/continental championship trophy at home slip away like a fistful of sand is not an experience easily shrugged off. The loss left a deep mark, an indelible impression on every portion of RSL nation that has lingered for years now. 


From top to bottom, from the front office to the players to the supporters, this organization is laser focused on the CCL. Winning the CCL is redemption. Its what drives the team forward. The MLS Cup, while a powerful goal in itself, is essentially the shiniest, most desirable ticket to the CCL in the league. I don't intend to minimize the cup by saying that, either. The cup means a great deal to all of RSL nation, but its a means to an end, and that end is to win the CCL. This is the lens through which you need to view the past few seasons. The CCL changed the focus of the organization. Doing well in the CCL and securing a berth in the competition are how RSL determine if a season is successful. By those metrics, 2012 was a searing disappointment.


By the numbers, it was a very successful campaign. RSL ended the season with the higest point total in team history (57). They won more games, scored more goals, and saw FW Alvaro Saborio put 17 in the back of the net, all team records. They booked a ticket to the playoffs for the 5th consecutive season, and played an excellent and competitive, strongly defensive series against a motivated Seattle side who ended up being knocked out by the LA, the eventual cup winners. Certainly not a campaign to be ashamed of. But at the end of the 2012 season after the dust had settled, they found themselves without a berth to the CCL. They'll be watching the competition from the sidelines, and for Kries and co this is a tremendous failure. 


They missed the first berth via an embarrassing loss to the Minnesota Stars at home in the US Open Cup. Like many MLS teams, RSL hadn't always taken the cup very seriously. Kries had stated this season would be different, but on game day he trotted out a questionable lineup that played with an egregious level of disinterest. If I were to pinpoint the moment over the course of the season where certain players found themselves marked for dismissal, it would be this game. It was a simply inexcusable display from the team, and, in particular from our corps of forwards. A full contingent of forwards who can't score consistently on a lower division team while playing at home is not destined to last very long.


The second berth slipped away toward the end of the season when RSL stumbled in their quest for the supporters shield. While they were in the conversation with San Jose for much of the season, the latter half saw them struggling mightly with injuries. They needed and were counting on strong performances from the second and third string players, the young guns who should be hunting for opportunity to shine, but those strong performances never materialized. We were left with mere glimpses of potential that did precious little to secure precious points and improve position in the table. More importantly, it was an expression of the same worrying trend; an inability to finish when needed. We didn't win the supporters shield, and by the end of the season, we'd lost our solid grip on the second position in the table, finishing second in the west behind San Jose and fifth overall.


The third opportunity for a berth was one lost fairly to Seattle in the semi-finals of the western conference. The same inability to finish was on full display. The team hadn't scored in two games leading into the playoffs, and they couldn't find the back of the net at all during the two game series with Seattle. Seattle had a tremendously stout defense in 2012, and its worth acknowledging that some of the scoring trouble is directly related to Seattle's brick wall in front of goal, but, regardless, a strikers job is to score goals, and the goals weren't coming on time. 


The dagger to the heart, however, was that the team sputtered in the CCL proper in 2012. They failed to secure a win at home against CS Herediano that would have seen them through to the knockout rounds. It wasn't for lack of trying. They put 18 shots on goal to Heredianos 6 in that game, but despite their best efforts, despite getting balls in, they simply couldn't find the back of the net. The CCL performance highlighted the truth becoming ever more painfully clear. RSL had a scoring problem. They could score goals, except when they needed them to close out games and series. The forward corp suffered from a confidence problem hungover from the CCL loss at home, and it was a problem that just wasn't going to be fixed with the current roster.


Its also true that our top playmaker, MF Javier Morales, was still recovering from a horrible leg break the season prior. He'd picked up a few knocks and he'd lost a step during his long road to recovery. The end result being that Saborio, our target forward, simply wasn't getting the consistent good service he needed. When he got good service, he'd explode. He scored hat tricks in two seperate games during 2012, and it was without question, a phenomenal campaign for him. But, again, the service wasn't there when it needed to be there. Especially during the big games, and this was largely because our most experienced playmaker had been hobbled, and his replacements simply were not the same caliber of player.


And so our off season has been one of overhaul at forward in particular.

**Players Moved:**

**FW Fabian Espindola** and **CB Jamison Olave** were the first to go. Neither player had been himself after the CCL loss. Espindola has always been an emotional player, and as our second forward working alongside Saborio, having missed clear cut chances in every single one of the big games, his confidence took an understandble nose dive. His production came in spurts and droughts, and while he remained an energetic and crafty forward, he couldn't find consistency. The net eluded him. To begin rehabilitating a championship mentality, he had to go. For his own good and for the good of the team. And so they sent him to New York with a clean slate and a fresh set of opportunities.

**CB Jamison Olave** was The Verb. Olave happened to you. He'd been a rock beside CB Nat Borchers for years, easily the best defensive tandem MLS has seen. At their prime, they were a brick goddamn wall. While his age was beginning to show, minutes being severely limited by injury, he remained a powerful and capable center back. The drawback was his pricetag. After the CCL loss, RSL had run smack into problems with cap space. Furthermore, his injury prone campaign had given the organization quite a few long, hard, encouraging looks at Chris Schuler and Kwame Watson-Siriboe. They discovered that the young CBs were more than capable of covering down for Olave. While it goes without saying that Olave would be preferred over either candidate, a quick cost benefit analysis made it clear that it would be better for the organization if he moved on. So it was on to New York for him, too.

**MF Will Johnson** was a fan favorite, widely regarded as the heart of the team. He was an engine out there, covering ground like noone else on the field. But he wasn't cheap. The decision to move him was strictly financial. He was a Canadian international, and he was good, and therefore, pricey. He was moved to Portland. He remains sorely missed by the fans.

**FW Justin Braun** was the next to go. He was a Salt Lake native that just never impressed. He'd been all over MLS, never finding a home. He was one of those good stories that just never panned out because the odds were stacked against him. No idea where he went. Don't care.

Next on the chopping block were **FW Paulo Jr, FW Emiliano Bonfigli, GK Kyle Reynish, and MF Jonny Steele.** Paulo Jr showed flashes of brilliance in 2010, but somewhere along the way, he just disappeared. He lost himself. Mid season he was loaned out to Miami FC to get him some playing time, but he was a known quantity. He was cut from the team. 

Emiliano Bonfigli was a player that Kries had picked out from the lower divisions along with Jonny Steele. He was blazingly fast, but he never made good on his chances, either. He was another failed experiment. He was cut. 

Kyle Reynish had served as GK Nick Rimandos backup for years. He'd been solid, but unimpressive. His option was also declined. He's since found a home playing for the New York Cosmos.

Jonny Steele was just... inconsistent. He had a few clutch goals during the course of the season, snatching victory from the Jaws of defeat and pissing off Timbers nation and maybe a few other nations as well, but those nations will be heartened to know that he lost us as many games as he won us. Maybe even more. When he wasn't doing something impressive, he was doing something equally unimpressive, so to see him off leaves most of RSL nation with a feeling of good riddance. He was recently acquired by New York.

And So the roster was tossed. By the time all the slicing and dicing had been completed, the only forward RSL retained from the previous season was Alvaro Saborio.",,False,self,t5_2rbnb,1361907836.0,,real-salt-lake,True,t3_199tap,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/199tap/real_salt_lake_rmls_countdown_to_kickoff/,

I thought it was kind of interesting, so I figured I'd share.  All data came from footballdatabase.eu

* The USMNT is 255-232-124 all-time

* Biggest Win: 8-0 over Barbados in 2008

* Biggest Loss: 11-0 to Norway in 1948

* Total / average goals scored: 861 / 1.41

* Total / average goals allowed: 877 / 1.44

* Most played opponent without a win: Bolivia (0-2-4)

* Most played opponent without a win or draw: The Netherlands (0-4-0)

* Most played opponents without a loss: Barbados (4-0-0) and Venezuela (3-0-1)

* A win over Cuba on Saturday will tie the record for longest win streak at 7.  This record was set in 2007 with a friendly win over China followed by a sweep of the Gold Cup.

* The longest losing streak was 13, all of which were friendlies.  It spanned from a 2-0 loss to Mexico in 1973 through a 2-0 loss to Mexico in 1975. (The USMNT were outscored during this period 41-7)

* Of years with at least 3 games played, 2005 had the best win percentage (70%) going 14-3-3. (The three losses were WC qualifying against Mexico and Costa Rica and a friendly against England.)

* Of years with at least 5 games played, 1975 had the worst win percentage.  The USMNT played 6 games and lost all 6.  (Including a 10-0 defeat to Italy B, 7-0 and 4-0 defeats to Poland, and a 6-0 defeat to Argentina)

* The USMNT have gone to penalty kicks 5 times, winning 4 times.  The one loss was against Colombia in the 2000 Gold Cup quarter finals.

The following a summary of the USMNT's performance against each confederation:

|Confederation|Wins|Losses|Draws|Avg Goals For|Avg Goals Against|

1358033709.0,66,self.MLS,16gmv8,PSA from a San Diego MLS Fan: Why Club Tijuana is irrelevant ,indienmusic,81,15,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/16gmv8/psa_from_a_san_diego_mls_fan_why_club_tijuana_is/,"All of this talk about Chivas USA has inevitably brought up the argument we always see during these threads. ""Chivas USA should rebrand and move to San Diego"", to which someone responds ""no, San Diego already has a team––Club Tijuana"". 


I consider /r/MLS a very intelligent group of American soccer fans and this line of logic is very uncharacteristic of this subreddit yet I see it constantly. I would like to take this opportunity to explain once and for all, why the Xolos do not mean San Diego could not support an MLS team. 

**the Myth**

it all started from the San Diego Union Tribune. if you google search Xolos San Diego, you see article after article Club Tijuana written by the same guy at the UT. The gist is the same––san diego has chosen a soccer team and it is Club Tijuana. These articles have been reposted here and elsewhere around the internet and even in XI Quarterly, spreading this idea. 

**Why this doesn't mean San Diego can't support MLS** 

first off, I would like to make it clear I am not arguing that San Diego deserves an MLS franchise in the sense that it should be the twentieth team or Chivas USA should move to San Diego or anything. I am simply arguing that Club Tijuana should not be considered a reason MLS shouldnt expand to San Diego. My Reasoning:

1. San Diego's ""love"" for Club Tijuana is grossly overhyped. 

• Xolos gear is not sold in sports stores. There is one BOOTH in one mall (in one of the most southern parts of the city). 

• estimates put 3,000 Americans going to Xolos games. hardly more than the number of people who attend the local high school football games. 

• in 2011, LA Galaxy had a friendly against Club Tijuana at University of San Diego. I was at that game. I, along with 75% of the fans, cheered for the Galaxy. The majority of Xolos fans were people who had crossed the border from Mexico for the match. people werent even talking about cheering for Xolos then. 

• only one match in Xolos history has been broadcasted in San Diego in english. (the recent championship game)

• There is no San Diego based Xolos supporters group. 

• As of yet, there is no way to buy tickets to Xolos games in english. 

• a missed point of a majority of these articles are the jabs they put in towards San Diego Chargers and Padres. Ziegler often jokes that Xolos are san diego's only winning team. its a joke. 

• first hand experience. I live in San Diego and drive all over San Diego county. I just don't see it like Mark Ziegler says it is. 

2 What is with exclusivity?

Do you cheer for an MLS team? do you also cheer for a team in the EPL? Bundesliga? USL-Pro? NASL? As soccer fans, we don't have to cheer for just one club in the whole world. If we take it as a given that San Diego supports Club Tijuana, this still doesn't mean that MLS should overlook the city. As a soccer fan based in San Diego, i casually support Club Tijuana in the sense of all the Liga MX teams I'd prefer Tijuana to win. I also support Everton. and Borussia Dortmund. These are teams in different leagues. You don't have to only cheer for one. 


**in conclusion**

The idea that San Diego is already sold to Club Tijuana is the result of one man at the major San Diego newspaper. many people have read his argument and taken it for granted to be true and spread it. However, the allegiance San Diego has to Club Tijuana is dramatically overstated, and even if San Diego did support Club Tijuana, it does not mean they would not be able to support an MLS franchise, as Club Tijuana is in a separate league than MLS and not competitors. 

I would like to encourage your questions and try to make this clear as possible. ",,False,self,t5_2rbnb,False,,san-diego-flash,True,t3_16gmv8,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/16gmv8/psa_from_a_san_diego_mls_fan_why_club_tijuana_is/,
